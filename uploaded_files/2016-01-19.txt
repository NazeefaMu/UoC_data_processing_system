A match defeat that disappointed a nation
	
This was a match the entire nation was watching with bated breath ?the match between the Kiwis and the Lions. Fans had reason to cherish much hope.?
After all, wasn?t it our team that still topped the world ranking in this form of the game?
However, some players whom the nation pinned their hopes on, failed. Some others did their best. Everyone was eager to know the reason for this debacle.
There were several rumors that reached the ears of the fans here. One rumour said that one or two players were seen liberal with the bottle until the wee hours of the previous night at a party held at the residence of a compatriot in the land of Kiwis. By the way, one of these willow wielders, had, in fact, faced a serious allegation during a match series held in Galle some years ago, they say.?
Now highly disappointed lovers of the game are eagerly waiting to hear as to what action the controlling body of the game is going to take against the players who had willy-nilly let down their country. After all, the country not only lost the game, but also dropped from Number one ranking to Number three overnight.

British HC trains FCID to attain personal agenda: Wimal
	
	National Freedom Front (NFF) Leader MP Wimal Weerawansa yesterday charged that the Financial Crime Investigation Division?s (FCID) officials were being trained by the British High Commission in Colombo to hunt down the politicians who are against the agenda of the Britain.
	He made these remarks while delivering a speech under the theme ?The end of the motherland?s journey? at the Ape Gama in Battaramulla.
	MP Weerawansa said the British High Commission was facilitating and conducting lectures to the FCID officials in groups on how to make an innocent man guilty.
	?The High Commission is tutoring officers to create a thief out of an honest man. However, its main agenda is to tie down the politicians who are against their agendas which are the power devolution and separatism,? he said.
	He said the UK, US, Norway and India had declared that they should be given the credit for the regime change in Sri Lanka, and therefore the government has to execute the demands of these countries.
	Meanwhile, he said the government is finalizing measures to bring in a parliamentary Bill to create a special war crimes Court before the UN Human Rights High Commissioner Prince Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein?s visit to Sri Lanka next month to satisfy the Prince.
	He said the measures are already being taken to weaken the military and the authority of the central government in order to pave the way for Tamil separatism.
	?The latest and the vicious tactic of the government to achieve this goal is to create conflicts among the Sinhalese and the Muslims. When the attention diverted on these issues, the government can introduce Tamil Eelam and separatism through the back door,? the MP said.
	He said the UN General Assembly would push for the recognition of a separate Tamil State once there is anarchy in the country and then it would intervene to send their army to Sri Lanka in the guise of maintaining peace.
	?We are at a critical juncture today, and we have to come together to save the motherland. The people rejected Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and his government in 2004 after he was elected in 2001, and this time he will be given a farewell party even before three years had gone,? MP Weerawansa said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Cricketers not under investigation: Mathews
	
	Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) Captain Angelo Mathews said today the team members including himself were keen to safeguard the reputation of SLC and that was why they volunteered to disclose what they knew about the match fixing allegations.
	He said this to the media while leaving the Financial Crimes Investigation Division (FCID) after recording a statement for nearly five hours in connection with a inquiry into the allegations. Mr. Mathews was accompanied by Counsel Nishan Premathiratne.
	He said the cricketers were saddened to read media reports that they were involved in match-fixing.
	?It is the cricketers who informed SLC about attempts by some people to fix matches. However several media institutions in their news reports gave the impression that the cricketers were the ones responsible. The players are not being investigated but the approach made to cricketers that is being investigated," Mr. Mathews said.
	He said he appreciated the stance adopted by Sports Minister, Sri Lanka Cricket and the FICD which were keen on upholding the reputation of Sri Lanka Cricket.
	Counsel Nishan Premathiratne who accompanied Mr. Mathews said the FCID had only asked his client to appear on Tuesday and not on Monday.
	Earlier, the FCID recorded statements from cricketers Rangana Herath, Kusal Janith Perera and SLC team manager Jerry Woutersz in connection with this allegation. (Darshana sanjeewa)

Double tongued politico wins the day!
	
A certain government purohita had to give a small portion of a land belonging to him for a development project linked to a river flowing into the sea at a point close to the city.
The development project was being implemented by a Ministry presided over by another purohita. ?By the way, the purohita who owned the land in question was amply compensated for the piece he had to part with.?
One day, a team of officials had with a gang of workmen visited the portion of the land acquired for the project to get on with the groundwork. Just as they got on with the work, the purohita had rushed to the scene as one possessed and started berating the officials. The irate purohita had threatened the officials with dire consequences if they remained on the land a minute longer.?
The officials fearing the worst, left the proposed work site immediately and lodged a complaint at the nearest police station.
The OIC of the Police station realizing the gravity of the complaint summoned all parties concerned for an inquiry the following day.?
The purohita who threatened the officials also attended the inquiry.?
The OIC quizzed the purohita about the serious allegation made against him by the officials.
?What nonsense. OIC Mahattaya,? said the purohita. ?We are religious-minded people who don?t mean harm even to an ant. It?s an utter falsehood to say that I held out such a threat to anyone?
The OIC turned to the officials present. ?You all heard what the amatituma said. People like him wouldn?t lie. Therefore, consider that the matter is settled and the case closed.? he told them.?
The officials left the Police station without further ado. However, they maintain that the threat made by the purohita is recorded in their mobiles. ?

Lankan tried in Germany for backing LTTE
	
A Sri Lankan-born man in Germany, charged with the membership of the LTTE which Germany considers a terrorist organization, went on trial on Monday, the AFP reported.
The 53-year-old German national, identified only as Yogendran G. by the court, is accused of having raised funds from 2007-2009 for the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in and around the northern city of Hamburg.
The LTTE committed a string of attacks against civilian targets and national infrastructure during the country's decades-long civil war that killed more than 100,000 people and ended in 2009 when government forces crushed the rebels.
Prosecutors in the Hamburg court said the man raised more than 81,000 euros ($88,000) for combat and terrorist activities including suicide attacks by the LTTE in its campaign for a separate Tamil homeland in the South Asian country.
The accused, who said he had been a German citizen since 2007, did not speak in his defence on the opening day of the trial, which was scheduled to run until March 7.

Lankan Smuggler escapes Dubai arrest through toilet window
	
Details of the incident at Jebel Ali Port emerged as prosecutors tried the Sri Lankan in absentia on Monday. The man, who was in the shipping business, remains at large.
Dubai Court of First Instance was told that the suspect tried to bring red sandalwood, which is banned because of its endangered status, into the port on July 9, 2013.
Prosecutors said the suspect knew that the container would be searched so he phoned one of the port inspectors, an Emirati, and offered him a bribe.
The officer testified: ?He called me and asked for help to allow a container with banned, red sandalwood into the country.?
The inspector told his director, who asked him to play along and pretend to help him. The inspector said: ?He offered me Dhs50,000, but I asked for Dhs80,000 and he agreed.?
The next day, the two met and the accused gave the inspector the necessary papers for the container and a cheque of Dhs80,000.
It was at that point that Dubai Customs inspectors apprehended the man and phoned the police.
But the inspector said: ?We arrested him and called Dubai Police. He asked the security guard to go to the bathroom and then escaped before police arrived.?
Judge Mohammad Jamal adjourned.
The CITES agreement bans importing the red sandalwood. The timber is highly prized in China and can be used to make traditional medicine, facial products and soaps. (Source: 7days.ae)

LG polls likely in June
	
	Local Government elections will be held in June after sorting out the grievances of all stakeholders with regard to the recommendations of the National De-Limitation Commission, Local Government and Provincial Councils Minister Faizer Musthapha said today.
	He said the LG elections were postponed under the powers vested in him by the Local Government Act.
	The minister said the five-member committee appointed by him to look into the grievances by a cross section of society including political parties on the shortcomings in the National Delimitation Commission report has undertaken to submit its final report to him by mid April.
	He told a media conference that the LG elections were postponed because of some 2000 petitions against the recommendations of the Delimitation Commission.
	"The Local Government Electoral Reforms Act drafted on the recommendations of the Dinesh Gunawardana led Parliamentary Sub Committee was gazetted by former Local Government Minister A.L.M. Athaullah on November 22, 2012. Under the provisions of the new Act, the local government polls must be held under the new electoral system. Under the new electoral system, 70 per cent of the members are elected under the first-past-the-post system and 30% under the proportional representative system. During his election campaign President Maithripala Sirisena had pledged to repeal the much criticized PR system and introduce a new electoral system to elect members who will be directly responsible to voters who elected him or her. It was mandatory to demarcate boundaries of LG bodies to implement the new electoral system and that was why the National de-Limitation Commission was appointed," the minister said.
	He said the government was keen to eliminate the shortcomings in the delimitation process and thus ensure a free and fair election.
	?If the government conducts the LG polls without heeding the concerns of the people, it will cause a political storm and the entire LG system would have been in a total mess, the minister said.
	He said the problems which cropped up with regard to the delimitation report were enormous and complicated.
	He said the report of the committee headed by Mr. Peiris would be handed over to President Maithripala Sirisena enabling him to issue the relevant gazette notification declaring the elections.
	?The Elections Commission is required to hold the LG polls within 56 to 70 days from the date of the gazette notification,? the minister said. (Sandun A Jayasekera)

	All analog electricity meters in the country would be replaced with smart meters within next couple of months, Power and Renewable Energy Deputy Minister Ajith P. Perera said today.
	While addressing a media briefing he said steps had been taken to replace five billion analog electricity meters to smart meters.
	?This will take time and very costly.? However, will provide a facility to save electricity and will help consumers to minimise their cost and better manage their power expenses,? the Minister said.
	?Power and Renewable Energy Ministry is to provide electricity supply to each and every low income family without charging a connection fee, from today.
	?If a family could not afford to do their house-wiring, that job will also be done by the Ministry. The estimated cost of Rs. 40, 000 would be recovered within six years in 72 monthly installments, which will be added to the monthly bill,? the Minister said.
	?The facility would provide electricity islandwide,? he said.
	?Only a 25 percent from the initial cost would be charged when providing electricity connection to Small, Medium Enterprises and large scale companies and the rest 75 percent would be charged within five years on monthly installments.
	Those companies could pay the electricity connection fee as they make profits, he said.
	?This method would be a relief for companies and it will encourage companies from the beginning,? Mr. Perera said. (Chaturanga Pradeep and Yohan Perera)

Some political henchmen considered this event as an ideal occasion to win brownie points to better their positions. One of them composed a song hailing the new Big Boss as the King Maha Parakum of Pulatisipura. ?The state-owned TV, quite used to the game of praising the powers that be to high heavens, happily aired this song whenever they got the slightest excuse to do so. A certain young director of a State-owned electronic media institution was ahead of the others in the race to promote this song, they say.?
Many people who supported the forces that brought the yahapalanaya government to power angrily reacted to the ?Maha Parakum song? soon after it was heard over the TV and the Radio. ?Some of them called the government high-ups and the electronic media heads to express their displeasure at the song. ?Are you trying to promote the new boss as a king the way you did his predecessor?? they queried.?
Meanwhile, the new big boss flew into a rage on hearing about the song being played to honour him on his inauguration anniversary and also about the uproar caused by it. He immediately ordered his aides to issue a media communique explaining that his government had nothing to do with the song that ?groomed? him as King Maha Parakum.?

Trial begins in 30-year-old Devananda case
	
The trial in the nearly three decades-old Kodambakkam shoot-out case, in which former Sri Lankan minister Douglas Devananda is the prime accused, commenced with the examination of a witness in Chennai on Monday.
The trial was commenced by Additional Public Prosecutor Prabhavathi before IV Additional Sessions Judge M Shanthi, the New Indian Express reported today.
Later, the judge adjourned the matter till February 1 for further action.
Members of the then EPRLF, headed by Devananda, resorted to a shoot-out in Choolaimedu in 1986 and a local by name Thirunavukkarasu was killed in the cross-fire.
Devananda and nine others were arrested and released on bail. But, they absconded and non-bailable arrest warrants (NBW) were issued against them.
In the meanwhile, Devananda became a minister in the Mahinda Rajapaksa government and was not arrested though he had made official visits to India a couple of occasions. The NBW pending against him was also withdrawn.
The case was split into two, one against the available accused Devananda and the other against the absconding ones, which is yet to take shape.
