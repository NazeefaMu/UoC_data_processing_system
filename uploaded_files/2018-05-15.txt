Cabinet decision on bus fare not acceptable: IPPBA to strike tomorrow night
	
The Inter-Provincial Private Bus Association (IPPBA) said it cannot accept the Cabinet Approved fares increase of 6.56 per cent, which would come into effect from tomorrow midnight and that it would launch an islandwide bus strike from by midnight tomorrow against the decision.? ?
Speaking to the Daily Mirror IPPBA President Sarath Vijitha Kumara said they had requested the Transport Ministry and the National Transport Commission (NTC) to increase the bus fare a minimum of 15 percent, while amending the minimum bus fare to Rs.15.00.
?We had a discussion with the Transport Deputy Minister Ashoka Abesinghe and several other officials this morning but the discussions were not successful. The 6.56 percent Cabinet Approved bus fare increase cannot be accepted,? he said.
He said with the 6.56 per cent their proposal to the Ministry had been a joke and nothing can be done with that increment.
?The NTC did not consider our criteria. According to our calculations there should be a bus fare increment of 17 percent but being reasonable we requested 15 percent increment,? he said.
Mr Vijitha Kumara said the NTC postpones fare hike saying that starts it starts calculations in May and therefore there was no sufficient time to issue the annual bus fare rates by July 1.
?Therefore, the NTC always says a reasonable bus fare increment could only be given the following year,? he said.
?After tomorrow night this will going to be another revolution in the private bus industry like we did previous time,? Mr Kumara said.
?We are launching the strike not to cause inconvenience to the passengers but against the recent fuel hike,? he said. (Chaturanga Samarawickrama)

Catalonia votes in hardline separatist as leader
	
?
REUTERS, 14th MAY, 2018-? The Catalan parliament voted in a hard-line separatist as leader on Monday, heralding an end to seven months of direct rule from Madrid but also more political uncertainty in a region that retains a mandate to seek a split from Spain.
The election of Quim Torra as regional leader will allow the wealthy region to run its own affairs for the first time since October, when Madrid imposed direct rule after sacking the previous administration after it declared independence.
It should also lead to Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy securing the backing he needs from regional parties to implement much-delayed central government budget plans. But it is unlikely to ease tensions between Madrid and Barcelona.
The deeply-divided Catalan parliament voted 66 in favor, 65 against and 4 abstentions for the election of Torra, a former lawyer and publisher with little political experience.?

Chinese woman bought a dog that grew up to be a massive bear
	
?
China, (rt.com), 13 May, 2018 -? A Chinese woman says she bought a Tibetan Mastiff puppy on holiday two years ago. ?Little Black? grew fast ? and never stopped until he became a 200 kg endangered Asiatic Black Bear and had to be taken into an animal sanctuary.??
?It was a tiny mastiff puppy, and when I brought him home, he continued to be one. But the more he grew, the more like a bear he looked. I am a little scared of bears,? Su Yun, a villager in Yuliang country in the southwestern Yunnan province, told the China News Network.??
Despite realizing that she had been sold a (non) pup, Su has been feeding the animal for two years , but then Su also saw a leaflet that told her that keeping a protected wild animal at home without a licence is illegal.??
Su then contacted the Yunnan Wildlife Rescue Center, and after being sedated the animal was transported to its new home. Authorities will not be looking to punish Su for her poor animal identification skills.??

## Title: Dark Side of Bureaucratic Red Tape

Dark Side of Bureaucratic Red Tape
	
?
?
Nobody seems to have cared when State Minister Palitha Range Bandara said at a public meeting that the Anamaduwa Technical College became a reality after he used his pistol to obtain the funds. It indicates how serious the bureaucratic red tape is in getting things done in the country.? ?
The State Minister said, ?when I attempted to build the Anamaduwa Technical College, vital documents were hidden. This forced me to draw my pistol from my waist because I knew that only by acting in this manner could I get things done?.? ?
We can recall another former minister from the same area having some years back threatened to break the ribs of a high-powered official when the latter obstructed his attempts to provide jobs to the youth in the area. However, these incidents become just talking points but no action is taken against those who stand in the way.? ?
?What do the officials gain by obstructing the building of a technical college?, is the question that arises when reading State Minister Bandara?s story. The answer lies in another story that has made and is still making headlines these days -- the story of the Indian investor who wanted to purchase machinery and building space to start the Kantale sugar factory.? ?
It has been alleged that two senior officials -- one a former Chief of Staff of former president Chandrika Kumaratunga and the other the Chief of Staff of incumbent President Maithripala Sirisena -- had solicited a bribe of Rs.540 million, which was reduced later to Rs.100 million to approve the project. They had been caught red-handed while accepting advance payment of Rs.20 million of the bribe money.? ?
The bribe-targeted red tape is a common phenomenon and has a long history. We can recall how a high-powered official during former president Chandrika Kumaratunga?s tenure had to resign from his post when he was accused of soliciting a million dollar bribe and then accepting part of it as an advance payment to approve a project.? ?
The red tape and the political patronage that backs it has even cost the lives of the people of this country. When 32 people were killed after the 300 foot high Meethotamulla garbage dump collapsed on them on National New Year?s Day last year, JVP and JHU leaders said it was bribery and corruption that prevented the clearing of the garbage mountain. JVP parliamentarian Sunil Handunnetti, the then Chairman of the Committee on Public Enterprises (COPE) said 108 companies had during the past several years submitted proposals for the recycling of garbage, but nothing came out of those proposals because of corruption.? ?
He said a Sri Lankan by the name of Sudesh, who is operating a successful garbage recycling project in Canada, had even obtained a licence from the BOI during the Mahinda Rajapaksa regime to recycle plastics removed from the Meethotamulla garbage dump, but had abandoned the project after a politician in that government had demanded 50 per cent of the shares as a bribe if the factory was to be allowed to operate without a hitch. Here again no action was taken or suggested even by the JVP against the culprits.? ?
Minister Champika Ranawaka had several times pointed out how the officials who are also professionals in the electricity and petroleum sectors use their expertise to rob. In the wake of the new government assuming office in 2015, he told those gathered at the Institute of Town Planners that there was a dark side which had not yet been exposed. Many corrupt deals, scandals and misappropriations that had happened within the past few years were masterminded by a few corrupt professionals and technocrats.? ?
?Many professionals rather than directing their knowledge and skills for the betterment of the country and its people have employed their intellectual capacities to rob, exploit and promote underhand deals misusing public funds,? the minister said.? ?
Usually, it is the politicians who are accused of high profile corruption. However, they cannot commit such crimes without the assistance of officials and professionals who are the ones who ultimately balance the books, on behalf of the politicians. There is the possibility of police officers failing to net the culprits because of the technical complexity of many corruption cases. Therefore, as suggested by Minister Ranawaka during the national elections only a panel of experts with necessary powers could handle this matter along with the concerned politicians who also have the necessary know-how.? ?

DIG Mahinda Ekanayake to be new FCID Chief
	
Central Province DIG Mahinda Ekanayake will be promoted as a Senior DIG and be appointed as the Head of the Financial Crimes Investigation Division (FCID) for a period of two months, the National Police Commission (NPC) said yesterday.
NPC Chairman P.H. Manatunga told Daily Mirror that Senior DIG Ravi Waidyalankara retired from service yesterday and would be replaced by DIG Mahinda Ekanayake.
?DIG Ekanayake is also due to retire from service in about two months will be promoted Senior DIG prior to being appointed as FCID Chief,? he said.
It is learned that a Cabinet paper had been submitted seeking approval to employ Mr. Waidyalankara on contract basis.
NPC Chairman said Senior DIG Waidyalankara could be reinstated on a contractual basis to his previous position if cabinet approval is granted for such an appointment after the retirement of DIG Mahinda Ekanayake.
Earlier, the NPC turned down a recommendation by IGP Pujith Jayasundara and the Law and Order Ministry to send the SDIG Waidyalankara on retirement subject to disciplinary inquiries.
The Ministry and the IGP also recommended that he be paid pension benefits upon conclusion of disciplinary inquiries.
There is presently an ongoing inquiry against the FCID head by the Special Police Investigative Unit in addition to a probe by the Bribery Commission. (Darshana Sanjeewa)

Facebook to empower youth and entrepreneurs in Sri Lanka
	
Dr. Rohan Samarajiva - Chairman, ICTA and Ms. Ankhi Das - Public Policy Director - India, South & Central Asia, <U+200E>Facebook enter partnership to empower youth and entrepreneurs in Sri Lanka
?
Facebook?s global ?Boost Your Business? program is now available for the youth and entrepreneurs of Sri Lanka. Recognizing the potential of the country?s small business owners, Facebook has partnered with the Information and Communication Technology Agency (ICTA) of Sri Lanka to train 10,000 small business owners across the country by the close of 2018. In the first phase, the programmed will cover Colombo, Galle, Kandy and Jaffna.?
?
The inaugural ?Boost Your Business? workshop, to be organized in Colombo on 16th May, will orient, teach and train entrepreneurs? on the effective use of Facebook to grow and monetize their businesses online. The workshop will specifically teach attendees to build a digital presence for free, leverage the mobile economy to gain market access and grow their businesses.?
?
Commenting on the partnership, Dr. Rohan Samarajiva, Chairman, ICTA said, ?Our goal is to create a digitally inclusive country with a strong and vibrant economy. With Facebook's reach and support, we will be taking a step forward in leveraging the potential of ICTs for the economic betterment of the country?.
?
Elaborating on the program, Ankhi Das, Public Policy Director - India, South & Central Asia - <U+200E>Facebook said, ?In a growing economy like Sri Lanka, small and medium businesses are imperative for boosting employment and economic growth. With this program we will empower local businesses by providing training and resources to build up a digital presence and grow their businesses beyond what the traditional offline economies offer. We believe that we can be a Net Contributor to the economy of Sri Lanka.?
?
?BoostYourBusiness? will complement the SMART Social Circles initiative by the ICTA to promote digital literacy and foster ethical and responsible use of social media. Facebook will also work with ICTA to develop a strategic roadmap for a collaborative information sharing platform for citizens under the SMART Social Circle initiative. Persons coordinating SMART Social Circles at district level will also be trained on the use of Facebook tools to share community updates.
?
As more and more people turn to the web and to their phones to discover and connect with businesses, it?s crucial that small businesses have an online presence. One reason small businesses succeed, or fail is their ability to attract customers. But with limited time and limited resources, this is expensive and hard for small businesses to do.??
There are more than 60 million businesses around the world who actively use Facebook Pages because they are free, easy to use, and they work well on mobile. Small businesses discover Facebook for their business because they know how to use it personally: setting up a Page is just as easy as setting up a profile. And Facebook is where their customers already are.?
?
Boost Your Business Training will lead to increased collaboration and sharing of information between the government and connected regions of Sri Lanka and increased interaction and information sharing across regions as far as, Galle, Kandy and Jaffna.

GMOA welcomes decision to absorb SAITM students to KDU
	
The Government Medical Officers? Association (GMOA) today welcomed the Cabinet decision to absorb 982 SAITM students to General Sir John Kotelawala Defence University (KDU), after their discussion on Friday with Higher Education Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe.
GMOA Secretary Haritha Aluthge told Daily Mirror that the Gazette notice on abolishing SAITM should also be delivered, parallel to this decision.
He expressed his gratitude to the Minister for his decision to absorb only the students, without absorbing the SAITM Institute and said there was no requirement for a new KDU Act as some amendments to the present Act would enable the process.
Dr. Aluthge said though the GMOA expects to end the SAITM issue, it would not accept any solution that would undermine the University. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

Her fall follows that of her political mentor
	
This lady was promoted to a zonal high office in the education department over and above the heads of several persons much more qualified seniority and merit-wise thanks to her close connection to a powerful provincial political authority.?
Once ensconced in this high office, heady with political power, she had started acting in an arbitrary fashion.?
The provincial political authority, the lady?s mentor, had to quit his office recently, and the lady was transferred out to a distant place soon after.
The lady the other day had called on a very high political authority and had begged of him with tears in eyes to cancel the transfer.
However, the high political authority who knew all about her track-record, ignoring her pleadings had told her: ?I understand that you had done a good job in your zone. Now go to the new station and do your best there as well.?

High authority is shielding two fraudsters
	
Government audit has revealed that two white-collar high-ups of a state-run undertaking had pocketed Rs.113 million of public money from the sale of a certain product essential for the transport sector. But no disciplinary action has been taken against the errant duo due to the intervention of a powerful politico.?
The audit report relating to the monetary loss caused to the exchequer has already been submitted to the authorities concerned, but it has been pigeon-holed due to the fear of incurring the displeasure of the politico who himself had appointed the errant high-ups.
By the way, numerous petitions sent to various authorities highlighting the misdeeds of these two high-ups have reportedly gone missing, they say.?

## Title: Holy Month of Ramadan BEGINS

## Date: 15 May 2018 12:10 am
Holy Month of Ramadan BEGINS
	
Religions and philosophies that practise fasting include Christianity, Judaism, Islam, Buddhism, Hinduism, Taoism, Jainism, just to mention but a few. All utilize fasting in one form or other, whether for purification, spiritual vision, penance, mourning or sacrifice.? ?
?Ramadan, also known as Ramadhan or Ramazan is the ninth month in the Islamic calendar. The word ?Ramadan? is derived from an Arabic word for intense heat, scorched ground or dryness. The Muslims world over fast during the holy month of Ramadan. Fasting was made obligatory (Waajib) for every Muslim who is mentally and physically fit and healthy. This obligation was decreed on the eighth Islamic month of Shaban, in the second year of Hijra after the Muslims migrated from Mecca to Medina.? ?
?The month of Ramadan traditionally begins with the sighting of a new moon denoting the start of the ninth month in the Islamic calendar. The Sun rises and sets at different times around the world, hence many people use applications, including time calculators, electronic reminders and printed calendars, to remind them of when the Ramadan fast starts (when the Sun rises) and pauses (the Sun sets) in their respective time zones.? ? Fasting this year in Sri Lanka will begin either on the eve of May 15th or May 16th, depending on the sightings of?the moon. The first day of Ramadan is observed according to the local visibility of the new crescent moon.
?The fast is from dawn to sunset, with a pre-dawn meal known as sahar and sunset meal called iftar.??
?
The Muslims world over fast during the holy month of Ramadan. Fasting was made obligatory (Waajib) for every Muslim who is mentally and physically fit and healthy
?Fasting during Ramadan is one of the five pillars of Islam, along with the Muslim declaration of faith in Oneness of God Almighty and his last Prophet Muhammad, the five daily prayers, giving alms to the needy or charity and performing Hajj pilgrimage to sacred Mecca. The month of Ramadan is seen as a time of spiritual reflection, improvement and increased devotion and worship. This Holy month has been referred to as the ?best of times?. The act of fasting is said to cleanse the soul by freeing it from worldly activities, in addition to the abolition of past sins. Muslims are expected to put more effort into following the teachings of Islam and this includes fasting ? which teaches people how to be more self-disciplined and have empathy for those less fortunate. Month of Ramadan becomes not only a period of fasting, but also sacrifice, giving, piousness and self-training and purification with the hope that these qualities will extend beyond this month and stay with us throughout the year. Indeed, the essence of fasting in Ramadan is spiritual. Fast is intended to bring the Muslims closer to Almighty God and to remind them of the suffering of those less fortunate.? ?
?Muslims abstain from food, drink, smoking, sex and certain other activities during fasting. Fasting is obligatory for adult Muslims, except for those who are suffering from an illness, travelling, elderly, pregnant, breast milk feeding, chronically ill or for menstruating women. Muslims will also refrain from sinful acts such as false speech (insulting, backbiting, cursing, lying, etc.) and fighting are also prohibited as these sinful behaviours may negate and nullify the merits of fasting. Muslims mainly focus on reading the Koran (Qu?ran), donating to charities (zakaat), and certain other meritorious activities such as engaging in special prayers etc. Congregational prayers and meals are held at mosques and in private homes in the evenings of Ramadan. The prayers and meals are usually well-attended.? ?
?Some Muslims try to complete the recital of the entire Qu?ran by the end of Ramadan. The last third period of Ramadan is particularly a holy period, as it commemorates the first revelation of Holy Qu?rans sent down through the messenger of God Angel Gabriel to the Holy Prophet Muhammad. Some Muslims spend the entire night praying or reading the Qu?ran and engaging in religious observances in mosques, particularly on the ?night of power? or ?Laylat-al-Qadr? commemorating the first day of revelation of Koran. More than 1400 years ago, Holy Quran verses were revealed piecemeal to Holy Prophet Muhammad during this Holy month of Ramadan.? ?
?
?The early great philosophers, thinkers, and healers used fasting for health and as a healing therapy. Hippocrates, Plato, Socrates, Aristotle and Galen all praised the benefits of fasting.
?
? Many businesses and organizations run by Muslims change their business timings during Ramadan month to make way for their religious observances. Special provisions are made in Sri Lanka for the state sector Muslim employees to engage in prayers by amending their office hours. In Muslim-majority countries, offices are required by law to reduce working hours, and many restaurants are closed during daylight hours.? ?The spiritual benefits of fasting during the month of Ramadan are almost innumerable and what about the health benefits? Even before the appearance of great ancient civilizations, hunter-gatherers across the globe reaped the benefits of intermittent fasting. But it appears that ancient civilizations across the globe were much more advanced in many aspects. In many areas, ancient civilizations like the ancient Egyptians or the Ancient Greeks possessed knowledge that modern-day scholars struggle to understand. Ancient evidence shows that humans have used ?starvation? in order to help their body recover and reap the health benefits it offered. It is said that regardless of territory or religion, different ancient civilizations had used intermittent fasting and were fully aware of its effectiveness. In ancient India, Greece, and Egypt, the people used intermittent ?fasting? to treat certain diseases, and also as prevention.??
?The early great philosophers, thinkers, and healers used fasting for health and as a healing therapy. Hippocrates, Plato, Socrates, Aristotle and Galen all praised the benefits of fasting. Paracelsus, one of the three fathers of Western medicine, is quoted as saying, ?Fasting is the greatest remedy--the physician within.? Early healing arts recognized the revitalizing and rejuvenating power fasting promoted.? ?
?
Even before the appearance of great ancient civilizations, hunter-gatherers across the globe reaped the benefits of intermittent fasting
?Yet, one might argue and ponder upon the health effects of depriving the organs of nutrition. Many studies on fasting have enlightened the beneficial health aspects than we first would think. Among other things, fasting enhances tranquility of the heart and mind, drops the blood sugar and cholesterol levels, may assist to overcome addictions, help in losing weight by the breaking down of fatty tissues in our body.??
?Healers and physicians with a spiritual and or holistic orientation are recommending fasting for good health and well-being. Conventional Western medicine has yet to embrace this aspect in full. As medicine evolves in the direction of body?s own healing mechanism, it will undoubtedly ?rediscover? fasting as the invaluable method of self-healing .??
?Undoubtedly, fasting during the month of Ramadan, brings about a multitude of spiritual, mental and physical benefits to mankind. The end of Ramadan, marks the culmination of fasting and the Muslims celebrate Ramadan festival or Eid-ul-Fitr festival. Eid-ul-Fitr in Arabic literally means ?festival of breaking the fast?. It is incumbent on all Muslims to uphold and sustain the hard earned spiritual, mental and physical attainment gained during this Holy month to lead an exemplary and pious life.? ?

Icy Indo-Maldivian relations haw with geo-political changes
	
India's Frigate INS Sumedha?
?
?
Relations between India and the Maldives, which became particularly frosty after the ascent to power of the tough and pro-Chinese politician Abdulla Yameen in 2013, now appear to be thawing.? ?
Political analysts attribute this to the changing geo-political environment and the rethinking that this has triggered among leaders of the countries of the region about ways and means of solving international problems.? ?
Both India and the Maldives are observing restraint. Total avoidance of each other that marked the recent past, has given way to a modicum of cooperation.? ?
An early sign of thawing is the Maldivian decision to allow India to send an Offshore Petrol Vessel (OPV) INS Sumedha to undertake joint surveillance and patrolling of the country?s Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) from May 9 to 17. The warship had been sent under the Indian Navy?s ?Mission Based Deployments? plan in the Indian Ocean region.? ?
?It is an endeavour of the Government of India and the Indian Navy to ensure the safety and security of the vast EEZ of the Maldives,? the Indian Navy?s spokesman Capt. D. K. Sharma reportedly told the Indian media.? ?
?According to the Maldivian media, two officers and eight sailors from the Indian Navy?s marine commandos wing are in Maafilhafushi in the Maldives, 145 km north of capital Male, for training in diving and tactics under the second asymmetric warfare training exercise called ?Ekatha?.?
INS Sumedha undertook an operational turn-around at Male on May 11-12, involving training and embarcation of some personnel from the Maldives National Defence Forces. There would be joint surveillance from May 12 to 15, reports said.??
The slide
India-Maldives ties hit rock bottom after Maldivian President Abdulla Yameen declared a State of Emergency on February 6, following an order by the country?s Supreme Court on February 1, to release a group of opposition leaders who had been convicted of terrorism and other grave charges. The Maldivian government said that the charges and convictions were as per the law of the land. But the trials were dubbed by international rights groups and Western governments as a witch hunt by a dictatorial Yameen.? ?
?Because the Yameen regime saw India as a fellow traveller in the West-led global campaign to free the convicted former President Mohamed Nasheed, the Maldivian Navy declined to participate in India?s eight-day naval exercise code named ?Milan? in the Andaman and Nicobar seas.? ?
Maldives government?s official excuse was that it needed the naval personnel and equipment to be at home to police the State of Emergency which was then on in the country. But the real reason was to show its displeasure with India.??
The Maldives followed this up with a request to India to take back one of the two Indian Dhruv Advanced Light Helicopters (ALHs) stationed in the archipelago to perform rescue missions. Maldives had decided not to extend the agreement to station the helicopter, apparently because it felt that there were too many Indians; that the mission was occupying too much space; and that the objectives of the Indians were not wholly transparent.? ?
It is learnt that the Yameen government preferred to have the helicopters minus the Indian personnel, but India would not agree to that.? ?
However, the Yameen government exercised restraint and did not go the whole hog to seek cancellation of the entire agreement involving the naval choppers.??
Nasheed?s demand?
Meanwhile, the ebullient and media-savvy former President Nasheed, willfully dragged India into his rivalry with Yameen by openly asking for a ?military- backed Indian diplomatic intervention? in his favour. He played upon fears among India?s opinion makers about the increasing Chinese footprint in the Indian Ocean and South Asia.??
While there was a great deal of support in New Delhi?s think tank circles for a repeat of the Indian military intervention in 1988 to thwart a coup against the Maumoon Abdul Gayoom regime, the Indian government had no intention of re-enacting it.? ?
The geo-political scenario in 2018 is different from that which existed in 1988. India is no longer operating in a vacuum as China is now on the scene. India?s diplomacy has also changed. It is now based on co-option and cooperation through bilateral and multi-lateral institutions floated by it rather than confrontation. Gun boat diplomacy is out of the question.? ?
However, with President Yameen not coming down even by a notch and with arrests of officials and political opponents continuing, the Indian External Affairs Ministry felt constrained to ask Yameen to lift the State of Emergency; implement the Supreme Court? original order to release and re-try nine top level political leaders; and restore the independence of the Supreme Court. India refused to meet the Special Envoy Maldives wanted to send to brief New Delhi on its case.? ?
The Yameen government reaction to this was expected to be sharp. It openly said that it would be better for outsiders to avoid tendering advice on matters they are not fully conversant with.? ?
The government then went on to state its case which is that the Supreme Court Judges had been brazenly arbitrary, refusing to give the Attorney General a hearing before or after passing the orders. According to the government, the Judges had been bribed by a fugitive businessmen-politician in self-exile.? ?
But Male?s defence fell on deaf ears. However, despite the acerbic exchange, New Delhi held its hand, partly because it now prefers to abjure strong statements and military engagements abroad, and partly because any overt political or military intervention could have led to the Maldives going further into the waiting arms of China. China had also said that it would intervene if there was any foreign military intervention.??
?
Maldives government?s official excuse was that it needed the naval personnel and equipment to be at home to police the State of Emergency which was then on in the country. But the real reason was to show its displeasure with India
Change in neighborhood policy
By then, India had changed its neighborhood policy. It preferred cooperative diplomacy to confrontational diplomacy. The accent was on accommodation rather than on using its might to push things down any country?s throat.??
Had it not been for such a change in thinking in New Delhi, the eyeball-to-eyeball military standoff with China over Doklam on the Bhutan-China border in 2017, would have led to a India-China war with deleterious effects on the resurgent Indian economy. The crisis in Doklamwas defused by diplomacy initiated and doggedly pursued by the new Indian Foreign Secretary, Vijay Gokhale.? ?
Given the changes in the global political and economic scenario, and the need to fulfill its multi-billion dollar projects under its ambitious Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), China is also keen on solving issues diplomatically rather than through muscle flexing and confrontation. That is why not a shot was fired in Doklamthough there was much belligerent talk.? ?
The unprecedented and successful two-day summit between Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping which was held in Wuhan recently, was a reflection of the new mood in both New Delhi and Beijing.??
China has indicated that it is not in a zero sum game with India in South Asia, pursuing objectives without regard to India?s traditional place in the region. Striking a new path, Chinese President Xi and Indian Prime Minister Modi agreed to have joint projects in Afghanistan. Prior to that, the Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi had asked India to participate in China?s Belt and Road projects in Nepal.The Chinese Ambassador in India Luo Zhaohui had told Indian journalist S.Venkat Narayan that China is ready to have joint projects with India in Sri Lanka and Maldives as well.??
The Maldivian envoy in India Ahmed Mohamed said in Chennai that like China, India too can undertake projects in his country. But he made it clear that the initiative must come from India.?
India is also moving away from the US, which under President Donald Trump has become somewhat unreliable and not always mindful of India?s concerns. India would like its foreign policy to be guided primarily by its interests and not necessarily as a strategic ally of the US. For instance, it would like to have good relations with Iran given its investment in the Chabahar port and the highway linking it to Central Asia.India is also moving closer to Russia both in military and economic terms through connectivity projects in Central Asia.?
Therefore, signs of improvement in Indo-Maldivian bilateral ties must be seen as being part of the many changes taking place in the South Asian region and beyond and not in isolation.??

Islamophobe pastor to pray at US embassy in Jerusalem
	
?
US, (rt.com), 14 May, 2018 -? The man picked to lead a prayer at Donald Trump?s much-vaunted opening of the US Embassy in Jerusalem, is a militant Baptist preacher, known, among other things, for calling Islam?s Prophet Muhammad ?a bloodthirsty warlord.???
As if Monday?s relocation of the US Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem needed more controversy, the priest picked to lead a prayer at the unveiling ceremony is Dr. Robert Jeffress, a megachurch Baptist preacher from Dallas and long-time supporter of Donald Trump.??
?Jeffress, who is also a Fox News contributor, announced that he was picked for the occasion in an recent interview with Fox&Friends.? ?Non-Baptist Christian denominations haven?t escaped Jeffress? castigations either. He once compared the Catholic Church to a ?cult?which was the result of the ?corruption? of an early Christian church by ?a Babylonian mystery religion.? He attributed its rise to none other than ?the genius of Satan.???
He also complained about how the ?consumer mentality of the church? betrays its core beliefs for the sake of luring more people. The pastor argued that if one abides by the Bible, ?every other religion in the world is wrong? ? including Judaism.?

Israeli forces kill 28 in Gaza protests
	
?
THE HINDU, 14th MAY, 2018 - Israeli forces killed at least 28 Palestinians along the Gaza border on Monday, health officials said, as demonstrators streamed to the frontier on the day the United States prepared to open its embassy in Jerusalem.
It was the highest Palestinian single-day death toll since a series of protests dubbed the ?Great March of Return? began at the border with Israel on March 30 and since a 2014 Gaza war.
The health officials said 900 Palestinians were wounded, about 450 of them by live bullets.
Tens of thousands gathered at the frontier on Monday, some of them approaching Israel?s border fence - a line Israeli leaders vowed Palestinians would not be allowed to breach. Black smoke from tyres set alight by demonstrators rose in the air.
?Today is the big day when we will cross the fence and tell Israel and the world we will not accept being occupied forever,? said Gaza science teacher Ali, who declined to give his last name.
?Many may get martyred today, so many, but the world will hear our message. Occupation must end,? he said.
Later in the day, Israeli leaders and a U.S. delegation including Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and President Donald Trump?s daughter and son-in-law, Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner, were due to attend the opening of the embassy relocated from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.
?A great day for Israel,? the U.S. President, who stoked Arab anger by recognising Jerusalem as Israel?s capital in December, said in a tweet.

JVP urges Govt. to reduce fuel prices
	
The Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) today urged the government to reduce the recently increased fuel prices and said the government was earning the tax income on fuel unreasonably, showing losses of the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC).
JVP MP Vijitha Herath told a news conference that the fuel prices were increased because the excessive taxes imposed on fuel and not because of the crude oil price increase in the world market or the depreciation of the rupee.
?A tax of Rs.31.60 is being imposed on diesel and Rs.60.19 on petrol,? he said.
The MP said it was the government that was earning the tax income on fuel and added that the CPC did not receive the benefit of the increase even though the price was increased, showing losses to the CPC.
He said the government had imposed a tax of Rs.111 on a kilo of milk powder apart from the recent increase of Rs.50.
?The government is not using this tax income for the benefit of the people. It has allocated an additional Rs.750,000 for the agricultural ministry building for which more than Rs.900 million has been spent during the past couple of years. Millions of rupees were lost due to the Central Bank bond scam. The government is imposing taxes to recover those losses,? the MP said.
JVP politburo member K.D. Lal Kantha said they had organized a series of protest campaigns against the increase of taxes and that the first would be held on May 22 in Colombo. (Ajith Siriwardana)

Lack of financial discipline and insight  buckles tourism
	
?
At a time the tourist industry in the country is lagging far behind the set goals this is an overview of judging the effectiveness of the measures taken by the authorities to attract the tourists and help promote the tourist industry.? ?
At present there are over 5,000 tourist hotels registered with the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority (SLTDA). The presence of these hotels ensures there are 30,000 rooms to facilitate local and foreign tourists. Among these hotels 218 are permanent members of the Hotels Association of?Sri Lanka.? ?
A special fund ?Tourism Development Levy? (TDL) was set up 12 years ago with the aim of promoting tourism. Sixty percent of the fund is allocated for promoting tourism and enhancing the training opportunities for the youth who have enrolled at Sri Lanka Hotel School.? ?
This fund is made of one percent of the tax collected from the total turnover of all the tourist hotels and part of the 15 dollars charged from tourists on their arrival at the airport and credited to an account of the Tourist Promotion Bureau. This account is operated under the Finance Ministry and the General Treasury.?
?
However a study of statistics in relation to tourist arrivals during the past years does not reveal any significant improvement in tourism in the country. This indicates the inefficiency of the Tourist Board in investing the financial resources available to achieve the expected goals. It?s also learned that there are instances of the money lying to the credit of the fund being utilistd by the treasury, for some other purposes beyond the scope of the fund.? ?
Until the end of war in 2009 the money under this fund was not used in the name of tourist promotion activities during the period because many felt doing so would be meaningless. Although SLTDA had conducted promotion activities after the end of the war, in some countries, deploying special officials, affiliated to the Sri Lanka embassies, a comparative increase in tourist arrivals has not been recorded.? ?
SLTDA has set a target of seeing the arrival of five million tourists. However during the past three years (since 2014) there was an increase of about 700,000 tourists. There is only 20 more months to 2020 and is it possible for the SLTDA to increase the number of tourists from 2,116,407 to 5 million (an increase of 2.4 million) during this period? Recording this achievement looks bleak given the existing slow progress in promotional activities.? ?
Utilising the fund? ?
When we inquired from Tourist Development Fund, the Minister of Tourism John Amarathunga said that some officials of the SLTB had spent the fund money without a proper plan during the past regime. But under the present Government this fund is utilized for the maintenance of four institutions functioning under the ministry of tourism.? ?
He also said that there are instances of this fund being improperly deployed by the treasury and he said that he hopes to inquire into these expenses incurred in deviation of the defined purpose.? ?
According to the minister plans are afoot to employ digital technology to tourism promotion programmes internationally; beginning from China and in Asian and European counties.? ?
From the revelation of the matters relating to tourism it is indicative that any significant action hasn?t been taken for the promotion of tourism in Sri Lanka during the past three and half years.? ?
These circumstances and the presence of instances of torments being exerted on tourists would not be conducive for the tourist industry in the country. All these negative factors would also adversely affect the SLTDA?s ambition of to achieve 5 million tourist arrivals by 2020.? ?
Cheap hotels?affects target? ?
In response to our inquiries Hotel Association of Sri Lanka Chairman Sanath Ukwatte said the purpose in creating the tourism promotion fund has not been achieved and the attention of the authorities should be focused on its proper management.? ?
In addition to the one percent TDL levy for the fund, hotels are paying 30% tax to the Government.?
With this heavy tax component it has become very difficult for the hotels in the island to attract more tourists and offer them facilities at affordable prices. The tax collected from tourist industry in Asian countries like Vietnam, Cambodia andMalaysia is only ten percent and as a result a rapid development in tourism has been achieved.??
Ukwatte also said that although the Government expects to achieve a target of 5 million tourist arrivals most of the tourists ? about fifty percent coming to Sri Lanka- seeks accommodation in cheap hotels with less facilities. Some of these hotels are even not registered with SLTDA. This situation would adversely affect the expected revenue from the tourist industry.? ?
Ukwatta said that Minister Amarathunga had promised to launch a wide international promotion programme to overcome these difficulties.? ?
The former Chairman of SLHA Anura Lokuhetti, expressing his views about the present state of tourism in Sri Lanka, said that the purpose of introducing the TDL to promote tourism hasn?t been achieved although a high tax rate continues to exist.? ?
He also stressed the need of utillsing the TDL fund prudently to promote the tourist industry as it is the third largest foreign exchange earner of the country. He also highlighted the need for the revision in the tax policy on tourism and the grant of other reliefs.? ?
He also said that various officers had been appointed to the Tourist Promotion Bureau with high perks. He also maintained that the Tourist Board and Hotel School weren?t able to carry out a satisfactory level of promotions to ensure the desired number of tourist arrivals, despite there being a regime change.?
Lokuhetti also stressed that those involved in the tourist industry should be vigilant of the movements of the TDL funds worth $40 million (Rs. 6,000) million as this money may be utilized for promotion activities outside the tourist industry.? ?

Low intelligence and communal riots
	
A picture of recent violence in Kandy
?
After the March mayhem of ethnic violence, Sri Lankans need to search deeply within what actually went wrong. I came across a publication done by Richard Lynn, a British Professor of Psychology, and Tatu Vanhanen, a Finnish Professor of Political Science, who conducted IQ studies in more than 80 countries. This was carried out from 2002 to 2006.? ?
The results weren?t surprising as Sri Lanka was at the bottom of the list surrounded by a few other developing countries. Our average IQ was 79. We scored lower than Kenya and India. In that list, the countries which have equal or lower average IQs had the highest rates of civil war or communal violence. The best IQ countries have no ongoing wars, no ethnic hatred and are economically expanding by leaps and bounds. Hong? Kong and Singapore topped the list with an average IQ of 108.?
Is low intelligence the problem here where people do not have control of their emotions? Are Sri Lankans impulsive and behaving in mobs because their brain capacity does not allow them to think and predict far ahead? And what are the causes for low intelligence? Is it brain drain? (I call this drain of genetics). And is this the reason why we cannot develop as a country? Is our social security breached because we live within a low IQ-ed society with pleasure-seeking behaviour? Is our political culture a clear reflection of our IQ status? These are a few questions which will remain unanswered for many decades to come.?

He said that 6.56 per cent bus fare increment was not acceptable and it was suspicious how the authorities arrived at the figure.

National Sales Awards - SLIM NASCO  entries are now open to send the best of your sales team
	
Pradeep Edward - President, SLIM
The National Sales Congress (NASCO) 2018, organized by Sri Lanka Institute of Marketing (SLIM), has gained national repute as a pinnacle event for sales personnel across all sectors. SLIM is proud to announce that the NASCO 2018 entry kit can now be downloaded at www.nasco.lk. Applications must be reached before 25th May, 2018. Applicants can call Dimithra on 0703463171 for further details. As the premier event dedicated to recognize the efforts and performance of sales personnel, NASCO is eagerly awaited by Sri Lanka?s sales professionals who rush to enter the keenly contested NASCO awards in a bid to revel in the spotlight of national attention from their peers, since it is the only national level event to recognize and reward the performance and potential of the sales force in the country.?
The NASCO awards have gained prestige and today a corporate?s success is determined by how many NASCO winners it has amongst its employees! Considered a rare achievement, every company jostles to enter its key sales personnel in the awards. NASCO 2018 is widely expected to attract a record number of entries. In order to make this event inclusive in nature, NASCO invites entries from companies regardless of their size as the awards are judged on the sales person?s strategy and quality. What?s more, English is not mandatory at the judging, and Sinhala and Tamil speaking sales personnel can also compete for the coveted NASCO awards.?
The judging for NASCO awards is uncompromising in its high expectations from true sales professionals and the judging panel comprises veterans across diverse industries. Companies need not fear entering their sales personnel because judging is carried out by judges who are not in the same industry as the candidate, thereby posing no risk of exposing strategic information. The immediate superior of a shortlisted candidate can even be present for the candidate interview process.?
Manthika Ranasinghe - Project Chairman, SLIM NASCO 2018
NASCO has met with repeated success year after year, with 110 companies from 22 industries taking part in the previous year?s edition, counting 550 entries in total. The immense value that a win at NASCO adds to the winner's resume and career advancement prospects explains its popularity.?
Moreover,? NASCO offers an enhanced awards ceremony experience because it not only empowers participants to benchmark themselves against the best of the best amongst sales professionals, but it also offers a free workshop after the grand finale, wherein SLIM makes recommendations to them about their weak areas identified during the judging and how to correct them.?
SLIM has revealed that participants can look forward to some exciting changes to the format. A new category has been added above the Territory Manager category while the judging process has been changed according to the current context. A reclassification has also been done of Industry and Business categories.?
As the National Body of Marketing, SLIM has been at the forefront of fostering marketing knowledge and best practices in the country. Organized for the 17th consecutive year, NASCO awards are being presented in 22 diverse business sectors under which categories territory managers, sales executives/sales supervisors and front-liners are recognised. In addition to Gold, Silver and Bronze awards, best female sales personnel are also recognised under each category.
In recent years, true sales professionals are scarce as the profession seemed to have has lost its attraction for young school leavers and graduates. As a result, managers from other professions who don't have hands on experience and knowledge in sales, take on the position of sales management which is not healthy for the future of the sales profession.?
SLIM NASCO fights to instill importance and recognition in the sales profession. A national level competition with participation from different industries has continuously improved the standard of the individuals. Hence, this competition has made a positive impact on the corporate sector. The sectors for nominations are: Fast Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG), Financial Services & Banking, Industrial, Media, Consumer Durables, Telecommunication, Fashion & Clothing, Healthcare, Modern Retail, Travel & Leisure, Insurance, Alcohol & Tobacco, and Corporate Selling.

??  People should  have guts  to make  complaints  ??
	
Pix by Waruna Wanniarachchi?
?
??Being a lawyer is not a privilege to disobey the prevailing law. If there is a forum or a bench I will appear before it and give evidence. There are nearly 15 000 lawyers and only a very few are corrupt. I?m raising my voice to restore the nobility attached to the legal profession. If I am penalized I will be happy. We have filed cases against six Supreme Court judges. How can speaking the truth be considered as contempt? If we fail to maintain the rule of law, the society will collapse,? are the utterances by outspoken Attorney-at-Law?Sugandhika Fernando.?
?
Young legal practitioner Ms. Fernando stirred controversy recently, when a video of her speaking about misconduct and corruption within the judiciary and law enforcement authorities at the National Library Auditorium, went viral on social media. The observations she made, which include her first hand experiences, create a bleak picture of our justice system. While some have hailed her for her bravery of speaking against such injustice within institutions mandated to deliver justice, she has also been subjected to criticism. In an interview with Daily mirror? the Sugandhika Fernando, who claimed she was not politically motivated, stressed she would continue her fight against corruption even if she is removed from her profession.?
Excerpts:
?Q? What are the main issues that you have identified in the justice system??
The main issue is related to the judiciary. Parliamentarians influence the judiciary. The hands of judges are bound from delivering a justifiable order or judgement because of influences made by politicians.? ? There are some critical issues when it comes to the judicial staff- the Mudliyars, Arachchis and other staff members. There isn?t an adequate number of staff members to handle court related matters. For example, there is a lack of staff to bind case books. A case record has to be bound as a file. Lawyers file the action, but the case records haven?t been bound. There is also a lack of stenographers, clerks, peons and arachchis. How can we maintain a proper judicial system without a proper office? As a country we must find a solution for this. In a society where the judicial system and rule of law are maintained the country will be in order.? ?
People have realized this, but nobody has raised a voice against it. So we- Mr.Nagananda Kodithuwakku and myself- will raise our voices against such corruption.? ?
?Q? What facilitates corruption and misconduct to perpetuate within the judiciary and law enforcement authorities??
People prefer doing things easily. For example, if I want to file a case before a court, I should go to the Registrar. There are several steps in the procedure to be followed. I have to wait to get a case no. I have to waste a lot of time there. But if I give Rs.1000 with the file, everything will be easy. Corruption starts there, from the bottom. Whether corruption exists at the bottom or at the high level, corruption is corruption. It is fraud whether the amount involved is Rs. 1 or Rs. 1 billion. We have to raise our voice?against corruption.? ?
Some staff members ask for yogurt, peanuts and tea to perform their duties. It?s their duty to perform their office work. They receive salaries from the Government. So why do they have to ask for yogurt and other things from clients or other people who have come there? I am against this.? ?
Judges, the judicial staff and lawyers should work together. We have to help each other. I?m not saying that we should obtain special favours from the staff or the bench. But there should be mutual understanding. Every person has dignity. A lawyer should not raise his voice against a lower staff member, because he or she is a lawyer. Lawyers don?t have that kind of right. Lawyers are citizens too. They aren?t people with super powers. People think that if lawyers do something wrong they won?t be charged. I am a citizen and I am an attorney-at-law by profession. Judges and parliamentarians are also under the law.? ?
Attorney-at-Law Sugandhika Fernando, speaking about misconduct and corruption within the judiciary and law enforcement authorities at the National Library Auditorium
?
?Q? Aren?t there adequate laws to prevent corruption within?the judiciary??
There are many laws. But who can make complaints? If there are corruption allegations, for instance, against a judge, who will make the complaint? Who will make complaints against lawyers? People should have guts to make complaints against anybody, be it the President, the Prime Minister or a Parliamentarian. There are laws, Supreme Court rules and customs. But who will make the complaint? There should be a?complaint to take action.? ?
?Q? What kind of action did you take against the misconduct of officials you revealed in your speech??
Under the Assistance to and Protection of Victims of Crime and Witnesses Act, No. 4 of 2015 a magistrate doesn?t have the jurisdiction to grant bail except under special circumstances by the Court of Appeal. In one instance, at the Marawila Court, bail had been granted by the magistrate when there were no special circumstances. To make a complaint I had to obtain the case records. I made many motions requesting for a copy of the case records. But the Registrar told me that the case records were in the judge?s chamber. How can we make a complaint then?? ?
After I made the speech they gave us a copy of the case records. The aggrieved party will take the necessary and appropriate action against the judge.? ?
Regarding the Mudaliya?s issue which I?ve mentioned in my speech, I made a complaint to the District Judge, with copies to the Additional District Judge, the Judicial Service Commission(JSC), the Bar Association of Sri Lanka(BASL), and the Chilaw District Bar Association. There was a proper inquiry conducted by the DJ. A stenographer, a registrar, and the relevant Mudaliyar?were present.?
Finally the judge asked the Mudaliyar to worship and apologize to me. I didn?t want him to worship me because he is older to me and because he is a male.? When Nelson Mandela was released from prison he said that he could forgive, but not forget. Similarly I told the Mudaliyar that his conduct shouldn?t be repeated. Mudaliyars shouldn?t act in such a manner. I took oaths in 2010. I made this complaint after two or three months?of taking oaths.? ??
The BASL has given me 14 days to furnish my evidence regarding the drunken judge, the Marawila Judge, and the Kuliyapitiya Magistrate. There are several cases in which judges have acted in an unjustifiable manner. I have documentary evidence. I am an eyewitness. I faced the injustice. So I will submit an affidavit. If there is a forum or a bench I will appear before it and?provide evidence.?
??Q? You?ve spoken about junior female lawyers being sexually harassed and sexual favours being asked from female clients and even female lawyers. Could you explain more as to your experiences and observations regarding this??
My experience is related to the Chilaw and Marawila Bars. That?s where I worked. You know about Justice Lenin Rathnayake?s conduct. That was about sexual harassment and lawyers helped the judge. These issues are not just limited to the Marawila and Chilaw courts.? ?
I know personally that some lady lawyers have illicit affairs with police officers in order to obtain cases. It?s okay if the relationship is for love and affection. Police officers are transferred. So when the same lady lawyer allegedly has relationships with different police officers who are appointed successively to that police station, it indicates a problem. Women don?t reveal that a particular lawyer asked them to come to a particular hotel to sleep with them because it affects their character. But this is the bitter truth. After my speech many have phoned me and told me the issues they?ve faced. I now have a series of cases against lawyers and police officers.? ?
?Q? You?ve been accused of making generalized statements. To clarify is the entire judiciary and are all law enforcement authorities corrupt, or is it just a few??
It?s a very few who are corrupt. My colleagues have misunderstood what I?ve said. They have made a web with police officers, jailers, prison officers and other relevant authorities. Due to the presence of these corrupt lawyers the entire profession has received a bad name.? ?
I am now being criticized for humiliating the legal profession. What I want to do is to put a stop to such corruption and protect our dignity as attorneys-at-law. Lawyers should understand why I?ve raised my voice. The practice of law is a noble profession. But can we call it a noble profession when such corrupt, shameful things take place? I?m raising my voice to restore the nobility attached to this profession and not to go against my fellow lawyers.? ? There is a notion among people that lawyers are rogues and thugs etc. This is because of a few individuals. BASL should take necessary and appropriate action against such lawyers. It?s then that the professional dignity of the rest is guaranteed.? ?
?Q? How important is it to issue a receipt for money paid to lawyers as some lawyers have said that it?s impractical to issue receipts for every case as there are many cases that a lawyer has to handle??
If there are a lot of cases they should maintain a system to issue receipts. In vegetable shops or small groceries the mudalali or the shopkeeper issues a bill. Even doctor?s give us a receipt detailing the cost of medicines, the channelling fee etc. Why can?t we (lawyers) do this? It is our duty to issue a receipt. People have the right to ask for a receipt.? ?
?Q? What are your observations on what causes law?s delay??
The delays in the application of the Law is a very crucial issue. To conclude a case involving an assault charge it takes 11 years. If the bench wants to call for a medico-legal report from the doctors or the Attorney General?s statements it takes a longtime. When witnesses are summoned and if there are no witnesses, witnesses are summoned once again. If there are no witnesses on the following day, they are summoned again. It should not be so. People need justice soon. There have been instances when people have died before the judgment was delivered.? ?
?Q? How do you plan to change the prevailing system??
On one hand we are raising our voices and on the other hand we are filing action against judicial corruption before the Supreme Court and other relevant authorities. We have filed cases against six Supreme Court judges. This is how we can fight and find a solution.? ?
?Q? Aren?t you afraid of being penalized??
No. If I am penalized I will be happy about that. History will testify that there once was a woman who fought and lost her cloak. I will not be disturbed by this. It is true that I will not be able to appear in court as an attorney-at-law. But do you think I will stop this fight? No, I won?t. I will fight as an activist, as a citizen. I can file action as a citizen. If my license is cancelled my struggle will become stronger.?
??Q? You spoke about filing action against judges in court. We find Ranjan Ramanayake facing a contempt of court case for criticizing the judiciary. One wonders whether the public has the right to criticize the judiciary. Your comments??
They have the right to criticize the system. It?s freedom of expression. How can speaking the truth be considered as contempt? The truth I have spoken is already known by the masses. If judicial proceedings are subjected to outrageous and reckless comments that can be contempt of court.? ? I am not affiliated to any political party. Ramanayake said in his statement that it?s not all lawyers, but a few who are corrupt. This is true. My view is that this case is wrong.? ?
?Q? Recently there were news reports that you were charged with for speeding on the Expressway. Could you tell us what happened??
On the 15th of March there was a case before the Supreme Court against P.B.Jayasundara. I was coming from Chilaw and I was late. The speed was 114kmph. I received a ticket and the police took my driving license. As a lawyer who stands for justice I accepted my wrongdoing. The police has a right to take my driving license. But I lost my ticket and couldn?t pay the fine at the post office.?
If I had paid Rs. 1000 at the post office there would have been no issue. But I had misplaced the ticket. So when I realized that the time had lapsed I lodged a motion at the Magistrate?s Court.?
I went to the accused?s box and pleaded guilty. Lawyers asked me why I didn?t tell the police officer that I am a lawyer, when he asked for my license. It is irrelevant that I am a lawyer and that I had a case involving P.B.Jayasundara at the Supreme Court. I had committed an offense and I accepted that. The law is the same to everyone in?this country.? ?

The Police today released a picture of a 50-year-old woman, who was wanted over an alleged financial fraud of Rs. 15 million.
Police Spokesman SP Ruwan Gunasekera said the woman had been evading arrest over the fraud, in which cheques issued by her to several shop owners had not been honoured.
The woman has been operating a boutique dress shop in Mount Lavinia and had issued the cheques after buying dress items from various businessmen.

The Mount Lavinia Magistrate?s Court had issued an arrest warrant on the suspect woman.
The Police said the CID had also filed a case in the Panadura Magistrate's Court against the woman, over a fraud of Rs. 6.9 million in 2017.
The woman, Dona Sithara Geethani Kaluarachchi, who holds NIC number 687611799V has been residing at No. 06, Uyana Road, Moratuwa and No. 194/31, Thalgahahena Road, Kesbewa.

A sibling of a prominent politico hailing from this area had won the tender to construct this bungalow, they say.

Programme? to construct a series of buildings at the Mune Sinhala Vidyalaya in Kandakuliya, Puttalam and install a solar power generation system at the premises in order to provide a cost-efficient and a green energy solution to the school. Sierra Readymix previously won a place amongst the top 23 at the International Best Practice Awards held in the Philippines for its pioneering practice of Waste Process Water Reduction, Grout Accumulation Reduction and Precast Reutilization, in its efforts to minimize the environmental impact of current industry practices.
Speaking about the honours received at the 5th International Best Practice Competition, Mr. L.C.Weerasinghe, Director/General Manager said, ?It was a sincere pleasure to be able to help improve education facilities of the children of Mune Sinhala Vidyalaya. There is much to be done in terms of assisting this particular school as well as other schools in the area. However, we were happy to set precedence in supporting the community in the area, in particular the future generation who will one day join the driving force behind our country.?
Sierra Readymix built five class rooms, a multipurpose building, a theatre along with a dressing room and a movable classroom that can double as a main conference hall at the school premises. The solar power system installed at the school premises today provides electricity to the school.?

Mune Sinhala Vidyalaya in Kandakuliya, Puttalam facilitates around 400 students from grade 1 ? 9. The school lacked even the basic infrastructure, compelling a large number of students to attend classes in the shade of a tree. This had contributed to poor attendance as harsh sunshine and rain proved to be hindrances to the process of learning.?
Having identified this crucial requirement, Sierra Readymix stepped forward to provide assistance and succeeded in constructing the multi-purpose building within a month?s time as discussed with the students and parents. Mr. D.N.N. Lokuge, Chairman, Sierra Readymix and Mr. L.C.Weerasinghe, Director/General Manager, Sierra Readymix were instrumental in carrying out the entire project to complete construction of the series of buildings and installing the solar power system.?

Sketches from the South:  Karandeniya
	
THE FIRST IN A SERIES OF TRAVEL SKETCHES ON THE SOUTH OF SRI LANKA
?Photos by Uditha Devapriya
?
In Beruwala and Aluthgama there is hardly anything by way of cultural sites to spot out and write on
	That is why Karandeniya is closer at heart to Ambalangoda than most other places in Ambalangoda
	ON the E01 there?s nothing to look forward to: No people to look at and talk with, no photographs to take and savour
	Fusion of newness and oldness can be spotted out even in the road leading to the Karandeniya Raja Maha Viharaya
?
From Piliyandala (where I live) to Matara, there is about 130 kilometres, the fastest route to take being the Southern Expressway (which will take you about two hours, or even less).
But the Expressway has its limits: it hasn?t been built beyond Matara, not properly anyway, and in those two hours, the only sights you?re exposed to on either side are newly refurbished homes, impersonal hills, and banal buildings.
There?s nothing to look forward to: No people to look at and talk with, no photographs to take and savour. Nothing beats the exhilaration of a ride through Galle Road.
When you pass the Kalutara Bodhiya, and then cross the much celebrated Benthara Paalama, remembering that famous saying about not trusting anyone who resides beyond it, you feel as though you?re entering a different world. That?s because the South is exactly that: a different world.
In Beruwala and Aluthgama there is hardly anything by way of cultural sites to spot out and write on, but you are overwhelmed by the architectural diversity, including that most Muslim of all architectural motifs, the trellis. (Tilak Samarawickrema, when I talked with him about the presence of the trellis in many of Lester James Peries?s movies, including Gamperaliya and Golu Hadawatha, contended that it was alien to Sinhala culture.)
It is when you go beyond Benthota that the tourist sites crop up: one by one, hotels and restaurants fill up both sides of the road until you reach a point where you can?t escape them.
Because of Benthota, perhaps, Induruwa, Ahungalle, and Balapitiya too are covered with resorts and spas, eateries, and whatnot, until you reach Ambalangoda, which is where the people, the sights, the sounds, and the flavours take on a distinctly Southern character. It is in Ambalangoda, I feel, that the South becomes the South.
The new has cohabited with the old in Ambalangoda. Especially away from Galle Road, towards Karandeniya, where the roads become more constricted the further you drive inward, you feel that the people you talk with to ask for directions have accepted the inevitability of the new without foregoing on the old.
Even in the way they speak, with their regard for emphasis and their drawn-out dialect, they are SPECIFIC. But those who associate Ambalangoda with the mask (and Ambalangoda still houses a veritable design culture) often forget that masks are hardly endemic to Sri Lanka and that the cultural roots of these places go deeper and are to be found more in the temples and the people who reside near them. It has been said of the people of Karandeniya, especially, that they are not afraid of talking straight if they feel they have to. But even with this, they are not afraid of encountering the new.
The fact is that the people of Karandeniya, who are more characteristic, I think, of Ambalangoda than city dwellers, produce one of the largest percentages of migrant workers from any region in the country. It is a statistic that has been forgotten, but that statistic has been all but completely acknowledged through the years.
That is why Karandeniya is closer at heart to Ambalangoda than most other places in Ambalangoda.
This fusion of newness and oldness can be spotted out even in the road leading to the Karandeniya Raja Maha Viharaya. Recently refurbished, the temple is graced by a long road that goes uphill and is flanked on both sides by a long stretch of one of the most Sri Lankan of all universally consumed exports, cinnamon trees.
The Galagoda Shailatharama Viharaya, as it?s referred to in travel books, houses the largest reclining Buddhist statue in South Asia. While my mother tells me that she counted 109 one foot tiles from one corner to the other, in reality, it runs up to 115 feet or 35 metres, not much until you consider the fact that the reclining statue at the Gal Viharaya in Polonnaruwa is about 45 feet or 15 metres. The temple, reflecting the Ambalangoda which exists outside Karandeniya, is both old and new.
Now more than 800 years old, it is a little older than, say, the Thotagamuwa Raja Maha Viharaya in Telwatte, Galle, and it traces its origins to the Dambadeniya Period, though the statue looks like it is made of cement.
The person responsible for much of the temple would have been the then Chief Minister of the King, Devapathiraja, who was responsible also for many of the temples which exist along the coastal belt of the South and after whom a school was named in Rathgama (the school my grandfather attended).
Incidentally, the road leading to the temple hadn?t been there before; what had existed were 208 arduous steps, which had proved to be too much of a hardship for the people in the area. The road had been a brainchild of a former Chief Incumbent, the Venerable Somananda Thera, while the chamber had been refurbished under his stewardship as well.
(Though the record of its being the largest such in South Asia has been confirmed by local scholars, there is another reclining statue which boasts of being the largest such in the low country, which includes Ambalangoda, and that is to be found in the Indrasararamaya, near the Sabaragamuwa region, around 30 kilometres from Colombo in Aruggoda.)
Around the statue are various other excerpts and snapshots from the life, not only of the Gautama Buddha but also the other Buddhas, who have been carefully marked and labelled in a long tableau on the other side of the shrine room. In one corner of the outer chamber of the room you come across Elara and his soldiers, and on the other, you come across Dutugemunu; it?s like they are about to meet each other, for their final encounter, and the Buddhas in-between are onlookers, overtly confirming a fusion of Sinhalese culture and Buddhist legends and iconography which is so often to be found in a Sri Lankan temple, though not quite so graphically.
?
?
And if these statues appear to be new, and not in need of being refurbished, that has a lot to do with the fact that about a century ago, a well-off villager in Karandeniya named Lyonis oversaw the renovation of them all.
There are obviously more stories which the ardent traveller can associate with the temple at Karandeniya, but for reasons I?ve touched on before, they tend to be missed. In that sense, we have to be grateful to Somananda Thera, who was dispatched to the Viharaya in 2000.
Someone told me that it was a recently built temple, but that?s because Somananda Thera transformed it over the years into a modern place of worship, renovating those parts most susceptible to decay, while also compromising on the archaic-ness of the budu medura. (At one point, the builders, misunderstanding the Thera?s instructions, covered the floor in cement.)
The ?newness? of the structure is in one sense the ?newness? of Karandeniya and its residents. Moreover, before Somananda Thera?s arrival, the entire place had reeked of bat droppings and, worse, wanton neglect.
The Archaeological Department, owing to certain understandable reasons, had not checked into preserving it properly. Thanks to the Thera?s efforts, however, it flourished, and its historical importance, particularly its association with the Dambadeniya Period (The reign of the Parakramabahu the Second) and Devapathiraja, began to merit more than a cursory mention.
It is from 2004 and 2005, right after the tsunami, that interest in it seems to have soared. Today, travel writers and even bloggers have written on the Shailatharama Viharaya when they visit Ambalangoda, once they are done with the masks and the puppets.
With hardly any habitation around the temple, Karandeniya nevertheless seems to have graduated from being in the outskirts of Ambalangoda to a veritable all-but-in-name tourist spot.
And though there?s nothing much by way of accommodations outside the city, as travel bloggers have made it clear, there are enough and more residents around these outskirts who are more than willing to take in tourists and visitors for a reasonable fee.
The people of Ambalangoda, rather like the people of the South and also of much of Sri Lanka in general, are friendly, but they are also straight talkers, and I witnessed this kind of straight talking while chatting with common everyday folk in the area.?
On route to Matara, the quintessential cultural hub of the South after Galle, I was taken aback by the vocal distinctness which still exists in this region; although we have been assailed and continue to be assailed by modernity, we still speak in the dialect of the region we hail from, even if we hide that dialect when we?re in another region and especially when we?re in Colombo. In that sense the most ?characteristic? characteristic of the resident of Ambalangoda is his dialect; he tends to drag what he?s saying, preferring to speak slowly, almost lazily, even when he?s loud or when the situation calls for quickness of speech.
As for the masks and puppets and the artefacts of cultural commercialisation, well, they deserve to be written on too, even though they have been written on by others. But I leave that for a later essay. For now, my travelogue in Ambalangoda ends in Karandeniya.

SL likely to follow Malaysia's example: JO
	
Sri Lankans may follow what happened in Malaysia where Dr. Mahathir Mohamad was elected as the country's Prime Minister with an overwhelming majority at the recent general elections by defeating the incumbent government, the joint opposition (JO) said today.
JO member G.L. Peiris said former president Mahinda Rajapaksa has done a tremendous service to the country just like Dr. Mohamad.
?They are both respected statesmen. People in Malaysia ousted their corruption-riddled government. When given the opportunity at an election, Sri Lankans too will oust the incumbent government. People's power will, in an avalanche-like down pour, sweep away this inefficient and corrupt government,? he said.
Prof. Peiris said the government?s inefficiency and lawlessness had paved the way for the underworld to raise its head.
?Someone is being killed everyday and the latest killing occurred a couple of days ago in Trincomalee where a man was shot dead. About 37 people had been killed in this manner during the past month,? he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Speaker officially signs Judicature Amendment Bill
	
The Judicature Amendment Bill which was passed in Parliament last week was legalised when Speaker Karu Jayasuriya officially placed his signature to the Bill this afternoon.
This Bill provides for the appointment of a permanent Trial-at-Bar where three judges will sit daily to hear cases on serious crimes.
The second reading of the Bill was passed by a majority of 67 votes, with UNP, a section of the SLFP and the TNA voting for it, while the Joint Opposition and 16 government members who crossed over to the opposition voting against it.
JVP members were absent during the time of voting. The third reading was passed unanimously, as no one asked for a division.
However, it will also be necessary to appoint the 35 additional judges as per another amendment made to the Judicature Bill six months ago, while the appointing of 100 additional state Counsels is also essential to make the Trial-at-Bar a reality.
It has been highlighted that more High Court Judges and State Counsels would be needed to work at the Trial-at-Bar. (Yohan Perera)

The great bane of many third-world countries looms in the craftily orchestrated dramas of greed and struggle for power in the political arena. Formerly Ceylon, beginning from 1956 and now Sri Lanka, in the course of the last four decades or so, has provided an ideal oasis for power-hungry politicians to play their astute games and political trickery at the expense of often misinterpreting peoples choices and oppressing them with their high-flown imaginary visions.? ?
There comes a time when an entire country and a nation can turn so corrupt and cock-eyed that they just are not able to see any other wiser way of thinking and deciding. The recent three elections country-wide, the Presidential elections, the parliamentary general elections and the local government election that followed give us a fair idea of how politicians are hawks at the game. What a pity! Where is the spirit of statesmanship exhibited by our great fore-fathers of the calibre of D. S. Senanayake, the first Prime Minister of independent Ceylon, Sir Baron Jayatillake, a great politician-philosopher, the noble rank and file of statesmen and national leaders who knew how to wage a commendable fight and struggle for Independence? Where have all the decent politicians and national leaders gone?? ?
A nation in crisis; all the way
It is true that S.W.R.D. Bandaranayake broke away from the capitalistic, imperialistic and aristocratic UNP (so he thought in his radical political thinking) to unleash the five-great-revolutionary forces galvanizing the monks, the farmers, the teachers, workers and Ayurveda physicians to launch an unprecedented people?s political movement, thus winning the hearts of simple rural Buddhist populace and bringing in a ?People?s Government? (Ape Anduwa). SWRD was not left in peace to bring in his socialistic vision into the soul of the nation. Strike after strike followed suit buckling his plans, communalism began raising it head, the signs of the impending not too distant catastrophe and national decadence were to follow. The 1960s betrayed a lamentable instability that hit the economy rock hard. No one forgets the economic depression of the 1970s the dent on foreign currency, lack of basic nutritional needs and the acute ratio of unemployment.? ?
The 1980s witnessed the volcano of ethnic conflict that engendered a fierce and destructive armed struggle soaking this nation in blood and hatred. Since the historical events of the triple colonial aggression on our country, the 30-year ethnic war could be considered as our history?s next most national tragedy, the difference being that it brewed from within our national ranks. The efforts of the governments were inept and impotent to quel this move towards a war. The expenditure incurred in fighting a world?s worst terrorist outfit sucked the country off its financial resources and left a country battered and bewildered.? ?
?
Instability and rattling movements in Parliament means in the final analysis, destabilization of the country which affect the civility and the economy as everyone knows. It does not augur well at all for us in the international scene
However, with the defeat of terrorism, there opened a new page for treading new paths for national unity, economic progress and social integration. In no time, the raw greed for power from the rulers and political immaturity of leadership, there dawned a period of political instability marked by race for power and the dashing of people?s aspirations to zero. This is the drama at the present time. The speech from the President and the opening of the second session of the nation?s eighth parliament gave us some idea of the state of confusion that had engulfed our country. Even at this eleventh hour, the opportunity for saner political leadership and the more enlightened understanding of the people at large can bring in some light at the end of this dark tunnel to which we have been led.? ?
Politics in this country unlike that of countries like Singapore, Switzerland and Finland has proved itself to be a disastrous national exercise. There seems to be a relentless greed to grab political power and once won, bribery and corruption had crept in at all levels into the sacred sanctuaries of public trust to dampen and poison their undertakings and responsibilities.? ?
No one doubts today the utterly miserable condition Sri Lanka is being subjected to by politicians. Recent events and revelations give ample proof to the despicable extent the State machinery has been vitiated. It is a wholly crooked system of public life that prevails in the country where even the civil organizations and citizens? movements appear powerless to stem this cancerous tide. Our politicians are experts in the disastrous skill of lambasting ruling governments while proclaiming their self-justified stance that they instead can rule better. They never get tired of asking for newer elections of all kinds and begging for newer mandates from the people!? ?
National politics and peoples? cry
Fishing in troubled waters is what is plainly going on in our political arena at the moment under the fake cover of concern for the future well-being of the nation. It is the ardent plea and the honest desire and hope of all concerned citizens who have at heart the well-being and the good name of the motherland to raise a cry for change and conversion of heart and mind in the life of politicians and those who dabble in politics.? ?
The power struggle of the political parties and their despicable greed had wrecked the hopes and aspirations of the people, especially the middle-class, the rural and urban poor. Which political authority in the future and political leadership will at long last relieve their long-standing sufferings and woes, we still yearn to see. Who will succeed in solving the national problem of ethnic reconciliation, turn around the economy down-turn and succeed in establishing an effective political and social order with a stable economy?? ?
We do not need astute politicians who can hoodwink but eminent and noble statesmen of character and of the calibre of D. S. Senanayake, the father of the nation, Dudley Senanayake who was the epitome of honesty and sincerity, and Ranasinghe Premadasa, the leader of the common man. Party politics need not be a shameful political rivalry for grabbing power by hook or crook. It must contribute towards the complementary vision of both the ruling government and a mature opposition. It appears as if there is a subtle form of tricking people and deconscientizing them of the real status-quo of the country. The dignity of the people is trampled and denigrated by those who use them as tools for their hidden agendas and personal benefits.? ?
The national government which held out many a hope for the people who voted it to power unfortunately could not attain their targets and accomplish their due tasks to full satisfaction. Instead, a tide of confusion has resulted where everyone is lost in the blues! The political life of the country seems to have boiled down to a game that is incessantly being played by heartless politicians who do not seem to care a tuppence for the good of the people and their immediate needs: cost of living that has to be lowered, fertilizer for the farmers, facilities for rural people for travel and school amenities for their children and of course creation of jobs. The question of decent salaries has propped up every now and then for various categories of workers. The frequent strikes are a sign that not everything has been settled regarding the anomalies of salaries. The farmer and the middle-class worker are at pains to make their ends meet in their day to day struggle to live and be content.? ?
Our traditional exports, tea, rubber and coconut products seem to be on the wane towards extinction. There is foul-play even in these sectors. Remittances from migrant workers are being threatened with the challenges facing their very lives and their unwillingness to venture into these employments abroad. Factories are grinding to a slow halt. Investors are having second thoughts opening up enterprises in the country because of the political instability and financial uncertainty. Then there is the constant rising cost of living that is our bee in the bonnet. It is indeed a sad scenario! As it is said, the ship is sinking but the merry-making is going on!? ?
Not all hope?needs be lost
In the light of the three urgent issues at stake at the moment, namely political stability, stable economy and national reconciliation, what is needed today is a disciplined breed of politicians who love the country, its people and are ready to transcend their personal gains with determination to do their best to work together for the progress of our dear motherland. Despite ideological differences that might be legitimate in a atmosphere of freedom of thought and expression, they must be noble-minded and motivated to work hand in hand for a Sri Lanka, a country well-stabilized, a socially integrated nation with everyone focusing on one single aim of facing the challenges at hand and capable of coming out of the darkness and uncertainty of the present.? ?
What is at stake is the morality in political and public life and the maturity and sense of responsibility of those in high public office in their being accountable to the people and manifest a clear sense of transparency devoid of hidden agenda when dealing with national issues and people?s problems. The revelations of the failures of the so-called unity-government carry many a lesson that can give wise guidance for the ventures of the future. All politicians of whatever hue in this country, must give up their philosophy of politics that make them unstable and unsteady themselves like the lizard that changes colours.? ?
?
In no time, the raw greed for power from the rulers and political immaturity of leadership, there dawned a period of political instability marked by race for power and the dashing of people?s aspirations to zero. This is the drama at the present time
Instability and rattling movements in Parliament means in the final analysis, destabilization of the country which affect the civility and the economy as everyone knows. It does not augur well at all for us in the international scene. It is the very earnest and sincere desire of every enlightened Sri Lankan citizen that we emerge from the present impasse and be well on the way to a period of political stability and economic prosperity with national reconciliation soon achieved to make our motherland truly the impeccable Pearl of the Indian Ocean.? ?

The family  through the eye of globalization
	
Man is a social animal which is against the concept of individualism. He cannot live alone in the society. He has numerous needs and wants and in order to get them fulfilled has to depend on others in the society. This is invariable of others having to depend on him to get their individual needs and wants fulfilled. This means that all the individuals are interdependent. Individualism, so conceived, starts indeed with the individual personality and from the inherent title of each individual person to enjoy the conditions necessary for the development of his or her capacities. However, because it starts from this basis it cannot end in any conclusion of Laissez faire or any doctrine. Individuals are not left alone.? ?
Collective effort?
People have to be assembled through a collective effort. This is the only way forward for an organized group. These get-togethers are organized for the sake of the individual, but the individual cannot assemble them alone. People use devices to communicate. Communication is a collective effort and helps to provide for others as well as for himself.??
Family
A society, in which an individual is a member, is made up of a large number of social groups, the smallest of which is the family. The family comprises a group of people who are related to each other.?
Nuclear families
There are close knit families whose members care about each other a lot. Most often nuclear families consist only of parents and their children without grandparents, aunts and uncles etc. There are also single parent families and they comprise either the mother or the father.
?In such families the widow or a widower looks after the children single handed. Such families are confined to the parent and the children. There are families with a single child and others with a dozen or more.?
?
A society, in which an individual is a member, is made up of a large number of social groups, the smallest of which is the family. The family comprises a group of people who are related to each other
Extended families
Further there are extended families. Sometimes the parent of the householder or those of his wife continue to live together with the householder. Similarly children continue to live with their parents even after their marriages and bear their own children. In such cases families consist of members belonging to three generations.? ?
Family background
?Family background relates to the family and the social class in which one has grown up in. It is judged according to prosperity and the social status of the respective family. Here the locality is considered and also aspects like whether urban or rural, the level of education of the members of the family. There are other various criteria including customs, qualities such as arrogance and jealousy, traits and skills of family members, diseases such as asthma and rheumatism or types of behaviour that?s considered. Religious and cultural differences are also considered.?
The family background often affects the progress or the retrogression of individual members. In extended families there are member get-togethers that are consequent to a member or members getting married to outsiders.?
Fathers-in law and mothers-in law join a particular family in that manner. Step-mothers and step- fathers join families when a father or a mother remarries. A child born to a step- father or a step-mother is called a half brother or a half sister of the children born from the first marriage.? ?
Ancestors and descendants?
Persons related to the family, who lived long time ago, especially those who had been important, are called ancestors. Those who will be born to the family many years after the present generation are expected to avoid the mistakes done by their ancestors.
?All members of the family have needs and wants. Certain members of the family are too young to get their needs and wants fulfilled. Babies need care and protection. Children depend on their parents for guidance, protection, education health etc. until they are old enough to manage on their own. As heads of the family parents occupy pivotal positions in the family and are the lynch pin in the family.? ?
Buddhist view of the family
Buddha has given the honorary title ?Pubbacariya? original instructors or teachers to the parents. This title is given to the parents because it is from the parents that children learn everything until they commence education. Parents teach their children all virtues in life and find them employment opportunities. They also find partners in life and give them as gifts whatever property they have. In view of the fact that the above [i] services and treatments are provided by the parents the children are expected to look after the parents when they are old.?
Charity, donation or offering gifts
??Dana? means charity, donation or offering gifts. Breast feeding by the mother, provision of household needs by the father and giving advice by the learned persons are needed to fulfill essential needs. These donations are treated as execution of duties and responsibilities by members of a family? ?
Use of pleasing words?
?Priyavacana? means the use of pleasing words in communication among the members of the family and the society at large. Words are used by mothers to calm their children and make them sleep? ?
Beneficence
Beneficence-?Arthacarya?- is doing good to others in a manner that provides advantages economically, socially or otherwise. This is done for the well-being of individuals and the society.? ?
Treating others as equals?
?Samannattata? is to treat others as equals without any differentiation on the basis of wealth, caste, race, power, literacy and external appearances.? ?
Under Brahmin culture a system of offering was followed to seek the blessings of deities and demons. The offerings were known as ?Bali?. Gautama Buddha gave a new meaning to the concept of ?Bali? and introduced the Panca Bali concept. According to this concept Bali or donations are to be offered by family members to five social groups.? ?
Global village
Today under globalization the family is being extended not only to the level of the village and the nation, but also to the whole world; embracing the entire international community. If the members of the global village cooperate for their own sake peace and harmony will prevail throughout the world.? ?

They ran helter-skelter for safety in nightwear
	
?
A group of politicos from the West on a visit to the North recently had to suffer a terrible scare when they got an alarm over the phone in the midnight that a fire was raging on the 5th floor of the hotel they had checked in to.
?
Panicked by the alarm, the politicos had rushed out of the hotel in their nightwear and run for their life in different directions.?
The politicos had realized only later that they had been misled by a false alarm given by some prankster. Their relief from fear had later given to an anger for being taken for a ride.?
It had come to light later that some members of their own group had set off the false alarm and they had even videoed their frightened colleagues fleeing in their nightwear for their life!

To Bolgoda ? from the Sky
	
?
Flying over Bolgoda
?
It costs 1.5 million rupees to obtain a PPL. Can be done much cheaper if Civil Aviation Authority introduces Sports Licences as they do in many other countries
	- Why not now? Especially when we have 15 airports spread around the country waiting for pilots to come and land
	-In 1935, private flying was so very popular ..pleasure pilots took their Tiger Moths and flew from Ratmalana to air-fields in Puttalam or Koggala and had lunch?
?
Float planes are great, they are commonly called amphibians as they can operate both on land and on water. I have never flown in a float plane in all my life and a few days ago I managed to clear that hurdle by flying from Katukurunda to Bolgoda in an open cockpit amphibian with the call sign 4Romeo-Kilo-Papa-Whiskey.
It is called a ?Challenger? and is a microlite by category, what they call an experimental aircraft that comes as a kit form where one can assemble the entire aeroplane in one?s backyard garage.
The machine sure was a beauty, streamlined and strong, with two long pontoons for water work.
It had fabric-covered wings and a fuselage with a four-bladed prop driven by an 80 HP HKS aviation engine. The best of it all was the BRS parachute that was stowed on top of the wing. In case the engine failed, you only had to pull a cord and the plane and occupants would make a controlled descent to reach the ground safely.
The entire aircraft could be prepared for flight by one man and at Katukurunda it was done by the owner-pilot, Captain Kshemendra Weeratunge, whom I watched doing a thoroughly professional job getting the bird ready to fly. (Kshemendra and I last crossed paths 25 years ago. He was my student then, learning to fly. Currently, he is a senior instructor at SriLankan Airlines and now it was his turn to teach me how a float plane operated.)
We started and taxied to the end of the runway. Kshemendra pulled out a little checklist and read through before we rolled out with the engine at full power for the take-off. At around 40 knots Kilo Papa Whiskey eased into the sky and I saw the houses becoming smaller as we headed towards the butter-coloured beach of Kalutara.
A shallow right bank got us navigated towards Kalu Ganga and we levelled off at a thousand feet. The visibility was great, and I saw old familiar places, Kapu Ella crawling, and Upper Bolgoda so vast and asleep with the old Bandaragama Bridge spread across like an imitation necklace.
We eased our way towards Ruskin Island and then headed towards San Michelle, which acted as an outer-marker to arriving float planes. We did a descending turn to head south and commenced the final run to land in front of the Yacht Club.
?
I have expressed this sentiment a hundred times in different forums of the aviation fraternity. We need to explore all possibilities of expanding general aviation if we are to introduce the God-given natural beauty we have in this country to be seen with a bird?s eye view
The approach, the power control and the change in pitch for the flare was smoothly executed by Kshemendra and the big floats ?greased? on the water to settle the Kilo Papa Whiskey like an over-grown pelican touching down on Lake Bolgoda.
I have done my first flight on a float plane. I saw the two picturesque Lakes of Bolgoda, the upper and the lower that I used to roam over in light aeroplanes in my younger days. I felt the amphibian land on water, and then take-off to fly us back to Katukurunda. Couldn?t ask for more, the sky tramp in me was happy as a lark.
The return journey we flew along the coast. Panadura, Wadduwa and the twin bridges of Kalutara whizzed underneath us bringing the float plane over Avani Hotel by the beach for a right-hand downwind to land on runway 29.
The journey was over. Fabulous is the word I need to punch to describe the experience. This is what Sri Lankan skies and lakes are all about, not omitting the mountains and the bronze-tinted beaches that border the entire island. Undoubtedly, pristine beauty at its best.
Sadly, it is totally underutilized from an aviation point of view. There are no light aeroplanes flown by private pilots in our clear blue skies.
The training to obtain a PPL (Private Pilot Licence) is available in Sri Lanka but somehow private flying has not become a sought-out pastime. Someone needs to get a big pair of scissors and cut off all the red tape that clutters the path to leisure flying.
?I do not want to point fingers at anyone, but to put the record right I must say that as long ago as 1935, private flying was so very popular that on weekends pleasure pilots took their Tiger Moths and flew from Ratmalana to air-fields in Puttalam or Koggala and had lunch and flew back. That was the norm then.?
Why not now? Especially when we have 15 airports spread around the country waiting for pilots to come and land.

We do have to remember that progress in aviation does not happen by having 15 operable air-fields or building new ones. It happens when you see more aeroplanes in flight, all sizes and all types. A good beginning for that would be the private pilot taking to the sky.
I have expressed this sentiment a hundred times in different forums of the aviation fraternity. We need to explore all possibilities of expanding general aviation if we are to introduce the God-given natural beauty we have in this country to be seen with a bird?s eye view.
A coordinated effort is a need between Civil Aviation, the Airport Authority, the flying schools, the Air Force and whoever is linked to general aviation.
Someone needs to take the lead and work with a vision to make more aeroplanes fly in Sri Lanka, lest we stay in the doldrums and cast away the vast opportunities that are abundant to us to showcase our clear blue sky.

Where is this government taking the country  ?
	
Sri Lankan politics is becoming increasingly acrimonious, yet again. There is a deepening polarization among the UNP and President Maithripala Sirisena on the one hand and the Yahapalanaya Government as a whole and the emboldened Rajapaksa acolytes of the joint opposition on the other hand. The President is openly undermining the Prime Minister. Now that he has implied his plans to run for the presidential election in 2020, this tenuous relationship would get worse. Mr. Wickremesinghe has his fair share of inner party troubles.?
Within the Tamil politics, the Tamil National Alliance is facing a fratricidal war -- one if unchecked could produce another Prabhakaran sometime in the future. Northern Chief Minister C.V. Wigneswaran has resorted to the time tested strategy of the Tamil leadership of the past, who used Tamil nationalism and trumped up grievances with a devastating efficiency to undermine each other, and to drive a wedge between the Northern electorate and the mainstream national politics. Sometimes, one tragedy is not enough for people to learn lessons. Southern youth were duped twice by the same megalomaniac to wage war against the states under similarly trumped up grievances.?
With a bit of nudging by the Northern political leaders and perhaps a helping hand from the RAW, it would not be hard for another charlatan to drive some quarters of Tamil youth back to Nandikadal. Extensive military presence would obviously have a deterrent. But, it took 15 years of a gap between the first insurgency and the second in the South. Till the time is rife, messrs Wigneswaran, Gajendrakumar, Ponnambalam and so forth can keep the pot boiling.?
?

The only political group that seems to be cohesive at the moment is the joint opposition of Mr. Rajapaksa. That unity itself portends a danger to the country, but it has thrived because all other people, who ought to have untied against this common threat are at each other?s throats.?
Mr. Rajapaksa should now be thinking if 92-year-old Mahathir Mohamad can make a political comeback, why not he. At the rate of deterioration of public trust in this government, he is not being overly ambitious. This government has failed seminally, perhaps with the exception of restoring a semblance of democracy. But democracy in the absence of economic prosperity and order is void. In both counts, the country is worse off than under the Rajapaksas, and much hyped remedies to economic malfunctions that the government claims to have inherited from the Rajapaksas have not made a dent. They have not worked because there is no political courage and determination to take political decisions that should go along with mandated micro and macro-economic reforms. Countries such as ours have a sense of urgency and policies and political actions should be aimed at achieving set goals, and should not be overly obsessed with rule following. Those latter kind of governments are good on NGO books, but are generally losers in the eyes of their own people.?
The economy is getting the worst hit. The plan for a second terminal of the Katunayake Airport has reportedly been shelved because our engineers think they could build it at a two-third of the cost of JAICA estimates (though our experience in complex engineering is as extensive as cricketing experience of our new ODI team). A new tender will be called and the project will take another five years and then it would be a miracle if there is no price appreciation commensurate to delay.?
And, the government is sitting on the blueprint of the Hambantota Economic Zone. That is one singular opportunity that can create wealth and change the face of the deep down South. But political vacillation is killing it. In this culture of procrastination, those who know how to milk the system like the former Chief of Staff of the President?s office Dr. Mahanama is making a quick buck.?

The government has even failed to resolve the seemingly peripheral issue of SAITM. Whether that is because its spinelessness is exploited by the interested parties, or the individuals within the government are reneging on the previous agreement is open to question. Elsewhere, the GMOA has threatened to launch a 24-hour strike this week to protest against the proposed free trade agreement with Singaporeand the Economic and Technical Cooperation Agreement with India. If the government outsources its policy decisions to trade unions, the country does not need to have a government in the first place. A weak government that vacillates over key national decisions does more harm to the nation in the long run than a proactive tyranny that has eyes on the long-term national objectives.?
This indecisiveness wouldn?t be confined to economy alone. A government that cannot enforce its will on SAITM is unlikely to be able to champion the new Constitution that the TNA and the Tamil political leaders have placed faith on. It will be checkmated by a few hundred rabble-rousing fanatics. On the other hand, if Mr. Rajapaksa can get a two-third of Parliament vote for his dynastic project, and remove presidential term limits, anything is possible for a strong government in this country. Unfortunately, this government is not that one.?
