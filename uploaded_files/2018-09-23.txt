Gota didn?t need tight security: SF
	
Former Defence Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa did not deserve more protection, Minister Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka said yesterday.
Speaking to the media during a visit at Nandimitragama in Vavuniya, the Field Marshal said that the security detail of former Defence Secretary was higher than what was given to him.
?I have been given 17 Police personnel. But Gotabaya has enough protection. As far I know the former Defence Secretary has 25 security personnel from the Army, Special Forces and Commandos.
?I have seen during a demonstration that he had the protection of the STF. I am not aware of the fact that Police protection was given after the military protection was withdrawn. But, he is well protected,? Field Marshall Fonseka said.
He said he was cordoned off by 500 military personnel during the war.
?But it is not necessary now because of the situation in the country. Former Defence Secretary is a normal citizen. He is not holding any responsibility for the government or for the people. He is not legally entitled to Presidential and Prime Minister or even a Ministerial protection.
?As far as I know, no secretary was given a protection once he retired,? he said.
Field Marshal Fonseka said that there were so many people in this country who had death threats and the country?s money would not enough if all of them were given bulletproof vehicles.
?If he was scared for his life, he can leave the country because he has a US citizenship,? Fonseka said. (Romesh Madushanka)

Solution to devaluation crisis, within a month: PM
	
Sri Lanka cannot increase its interest rates as a precaution to the devaluation of the rupee as done by many other countries to save their respective currencies against the US dollar as it affects investors but will take some action to arrest the crisis in one month?s time, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said over the weekend.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe who was speaking at a public function at Lourdes College in Nattandiya on Saturday said that Sri Lanka needs to handle the devaluation crisis with utmost care.
?Countries such as Indonesia, Argentina, India, Mexico and Turkey had increased their interest rates as a temporary measure. However, Sri Lanka cannot do so as high-interest rates will affect the investors adversely.
But the government will take some action in a month?s time as the situation is expected to be more stable then,? the Prime Minister said.
?The crisis actually started in 2008 when the US economy crashed. The value of the dollar went down. Investors withdrew their monies from the US stock markets. Other investors also took their funds out of US and invested in other countries. Money was pumped out of the USA.
However, the industrial production in the US has increased as of now. People in that country tend to spend more for purchasing as a result of concessions given by President Trump. Interest rates in the USA have been increased lately.
This has made the investors to pump their money out of other countries towards the USA. This is why the local currencies in many countries have devalued against the US dollar.
Value of a Euro has gone down by 1.3 per cent, Sterling pound by 1.3 per cent, Australian dollar by 6.5 per cent, Indonesian Rupaya by 8.6 per cent, Korean currency by 4.5 per cent, Philippine pesos by 7.5 per cent and Malaysian currency by 1.6 per cent. Sri Lankan rupee had gone down by 9 per cent and the Indian rupee by 11 per cent,? he added.
?The price of oil has gone up today. Other than the price hike the USA has imposed on sanctions against Russia and Iran. Demand for oil that is produced elsewhere in the world increases as a result.
Therefore, the price of oil increases on one hand and the value of the dollar is increased. Prices of other commodities also go up as a result of the oil price hike. All other countries except the USA faces this crisis. As of now a sum of US $ 443 million has been taken out of Sri Lankan stock exchange and other markets,? he said.
He also said the trade wars which the USA had got into with China and Canada had made things unclear where the globe is concerned. ?We do not know what will happen in the future with the trade wars which the USA had got into with Canada and China. However, the government will not allow Sri Lanka?s economy to crash,? the Prime Minister assured. (Yohan Perera)

Voting begins in criticised Maldives election
	
The Maldives has started to vote in a heavily-criticised election that will be closely watched by India and China.
The Indian Ocean archipelago is best-known overseas for its clear waters and high-end resorts but its government stands accused of crushing dissent.
President Abdulla Yameen has embraced China, while his opponent, Ibrahim Mohamed Solih, is seen as leaning towards India and the West.
The European Union and US have voiced concerns about the election.
Both have threatened to impose targeted sanctions if the democratic situation does not improve.
Police raided opposition headquarters on the eve of the vote, according to local reports.
Polls opened at 08:00 (03:00 GMT) on Sunday.
The Maldives is made up of 26 coral atolls and 1,192 islands, and tourism is a vital part of its economy. More than 400,000 people live there but its future hangs in the balance due to climate change. (BBC)
