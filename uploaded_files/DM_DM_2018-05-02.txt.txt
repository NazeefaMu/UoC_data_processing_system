Ruffled over coming of an interloper
	

There was a rumour swirling in political circles in the recent past that a Blue big gun from Rajarata was getting set to join the Green party. Some Greens ruling the roost in that part of the country went long-faced when they first heard this rumour, they say.

Of all the unhappy Greens, the one that went grumpiest on hearing this rumour was a fair one in politics by family descent, they say.
Highly upset over the prospect of having to share her fortunes with an interloper, the fair one has reportedly been telling all her intimates that she may have to take a hard decision should the hateful event materialize.
Meanwhile, the Blue heavyweight said to be poised for the long jump is busy these days organizing a massive scale pinkama to win the goodwill of the Buddhist clergy in the area,
they say.

Set to stage the comeback with a big bang
	

Gabby Gemunu who once played the role of a court jester has now set his heart and soul on founding a new political front in a bid to foray into politics again with a big bang.

Giving a hint about the direction of his new political journey, gabby Gemunu fired a broadside at the siblings of the leading political family in his home turf, Giruwapattu and proceeded to hand a testimonial to Number Two who is badly in need of loyalists these days. He has also already set up a political office on a newly purchased piece of land in Magampura.
Gemunus immediate plan is to groom his offspring to contest the upcoming PC polls,
they say.
Gemunu was deeply disappointed, they say, when his political mentor, the former strongman failed to attend his offsprings recent wedding. This disappointment  the let-down feeling  he had to suffer caused him to change the direction of his new political journey, say those close to Gemunu.

SL-Singapore FTA will affect our professionals: Wimal
	
National Freedom Front (NFF) Leader and MP Wimal Weerawansa said today the recently signed Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with Singapore was done in an illegal manner and that it would adversely affect Sri Lankan professionals.
He told a news briefing this treaty would provide ample room for not only Singaporean professionals but also those of India, China and Malaysia to freely enter the Sri Lankan job market.
When professionals from Singapore and other Asian countries invade the Sri Lankan job market, our professionals will lose opportunities to sustain themselves, the MP said.
Although the FTA has been signed without the Cabinet approval, Development Strategies and International Trade Minister Malik Samarawickrama had shrewdly prepared Cabinet papers to show that it has been approved by the Cabinet. That is why we say that it has been signed in an illegal manner. The minister is a confidant of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe who is fond of acting according to others tell him, he said.
The MP said government attempts to sign the Indo-Lanka Economic and Technology Cooperation Agreement (ETCA) would also be achieved through the FTA with Singapore as it provided room for Indian professionals to engage in Sri Lankan job market.(Sheain Fernandopulle)

Some migrants from caravan allowed into US
	

REUTERS, 01st MAY, 2018-Hopes rose on Tuesday among a caravan of migrants who travelled from Central America to seek asylum in the United States after U.S. border authorities allowed the first small group of women and children entry from Mexico overnight.
Gathering people along the way, the caravan set off a month ago on a 2,000-mile (3,220-km) trek across Mexico to the U.S. border, drawing attention from American news media after President Donald Trump took to Twitter to demand such groups not be granted entry and urging stronger immigration laws.
Celebrations erupted on Monday night among dozens of migrants camped near the U.S. border crossing in Tijuana, Mexico, after U.S. officials admitted eight women and children, fueling the determination of others to remain until they were admitted.
However, the U.S. Department of Justice late on Monday announced what it described as the first prosecutions against members of the caravan, filing criminal charges against 11 migrants accused of entering the country illegally about four miles (6 km) west of the San Ysidro, California, border crossing.
The United States will not stand by as our immigration laws are ignored and our nations safety is jeopardized, U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions said in a statement announcing the charges.
The statement did not provide a figure on any other caravan members who might have also been detained.
On the asylum applicants, the Trump administrations hands are tied by international rules obliging the United States to accept some applications. Most in the caravan said they were fleeing death threats, extortion and violence from powerful street gangs.

THE BURNING QUESTION when
	
1 We have talked about so many burning issues including the ones of UDAYANGA, MAHENDRAN and JALIYA, but we havent seen a single brought to conclusion. Either we await action from INTERPOL or our own sleuths. Going back on the local scenario, what happened with the findings on THAJUDEEN, LASANTHA, AVANT GARDE, ALOYSIUS, PALIASENA et al We continuously seem to be waiting and waiting, not concluding anything. WHY SUCH INORDINATE DELAYS IN IMPLEMENTING THE LAW
2 What is happening to the Cabinet is that its members are unable to find themselves or what they want. The postponements go on and on while pistol-wielding folks are being brought back to power. What a fantastic state of affairs the country is in! In the meantime, our President says Cabinet posts need international approval. Wonder which country in the world will give the nod to our Cabinet Yakkos! Hats off to Joseph Michael Perera, the only one who had the guts to resign opposing Ravi Ks appointment. They should have all resigned en masse. Has Ravi K not caused enough damage to the party What are our so called leaders about It seems like it does not matter at all to the rest of them!
The postponements go on and on while pistol-wielding folks are being brought back to power
3 In the midst of all these chaos, we hear of electing new office bearers. A few days ago, I received a petition from a friend and it is apparently making its rounds in India. As I find it very applicable to our ministers, let me reproduce it below:
4 Parliamentarians should NOT be entitled to pension as it is NOT employment but ELECTION under the PEOPLES REPRESENTATION ACT. It has no retirement and does not bar re-employment, so they can be re-elected to the same position (currently they receive pension after 5 years of service).
The remuneration of Parliamentarians should be revised in line with the Central Pay Commission. They arbitrarily increase their salaries by voting for themselves.
Parliamentarians should be deprived of their special healthcare system and should participate in the same system as the general public in Sri Lanka. (Perhaps they will then really and truly realise what we go through)
All concessions like free travel, rations, electricity, water and telephone bills should be abolished. (They not only get these concessions but also regularly increase them  boldly and shamelessly).
Parliamentarians with tainted records, criminal charges and convictions (past or present) should be summarily banned from Parliament and contesting elections under any pretext. Financial losses incurred due to politicians in office must be recovered from their families and properties of their nominees.
Parliamentarians should equally abide by all laws they impose on the general public.
No surrender of subsidies including LPG by citizens unless all subsidies available to MPs are withdrawn including subsidized food in the Parliament canteen.
Retirement age should be 60 for politicians too. SERVING IN PARLIAMENT IS AN HONOUR, NOT A LUCRATIVE CAREER FOR LOOTING!
5This is indeed a well thought out plan and should apply to our politicians too. After all, we are told that they are elected to Parliament to serve the people of the country. Have we ever seen any one of them going down on their knees to serve the people Oh no, it is the reverse! It is the people who are going down on their knees to serve these crooks! WHAT A COMEDY OF ERRORS!
6 In the process of finishing this article, I am reminded that May 1 marked the 25th death anniversary of the late President Ranasinghe Premadasa. Now here was a man who walked the line unafraid. A man who truly served the poor and no matter what other political problems or extravaganzas he had, he was sincerely dedicated to the poor. When he promised to do something, it was a foregone conclusion that IT WOULD BE DONE AND GOD HELP ANY MAN WHO HAD BEEN ENTRUSTED WITH WHATEVER IT WAS AND FAILED. Anyone could meet him at any time; he always had time for the poor. Is there a single politician today whom we have access to They are still struggling to get the Cabinet together, to hand out portfolios -- they dont even know who is capable of doing what. As I said earlier, postponement seems to be the name of the game!
7 While the political tug-of-war wages on, the country continues to degenerate in cleanliness, morals, principles et al. I recently met some of our fellow brethren, now settled abroad, who have travelled on SriLankan Airlines and while they commended the service, they said sanitary facilities were appalling! They were equally shocked to note how dirty the country is in general. Rubbish littered all over! The question therefore is, WHAT DO WE DO AND TO WHOM SHOULD WE TURN TO IF WE NEED TO RESOLVE THIS UNHOLY MESS
8 Politicians of the calibre of Premadasa, Athulathmudali and Dissanayake will never grace this country again. Our country is the poorer for having lost them. They used their God-given BRAINS AND TALENTS to serve their motherland; true they served themselves also in the process but let it never be said that they did nothing to this country! Issues, both political and general, were meticulously dealt with. They left nothing to chance. This is why I stress that our country was and is the poorer for having lost them. We cannot say the same of any one of them today, except perhaps one or two!

They are to function as an independent group
	

The Cabal of 16 now set to sit in the opposition held a decisive powwow in the Gentlemens Game House the other day. While discussing their political future, they considered the question of teaming up with Pohottuwa.

During the lengthy discourse that ensued most of them shared the view that though they could maintain cordial relations with the former strongman, they were doubtful whether they could be comfortable in Pohottuwa given the sway being held over the party by a certain character pursuing his own personal agenda. So, they finally decided not to team up with Pohottuwa, they say.
So, the Cabal of 16 is to function as an independent group in the opposition with either the former Betel leaf secretary or Uncle John as their leader.

## Title: UNP changes: Band-Aids or a surgery
## Section: Opinion

UNP changes: Band-Aids or a surgery
	
We rise by lifting others~Robert Ingersoll
The United National Party (UNP) needed surgery. A creative experienced surgeon would have used his scalpel with precision and cut and sutured the fragments that have been malignant, creating a dangerous disease that shrouded the whole body, paralyzing the limbs, penetrating into the marrow and benumbing the critical chunks. Yet it looks like the changes that entailed a dismal performance at the recently concluded local government elections were not a result caused by the scalpel of such an experienced surgeon. It looks more like a procedure in between surgery and Band-Aids, performed by an amateur, still learning the fine art (or in this case science) of prescribing a sure remedy for a protracted malady.
The UNPs woes are many. And they are varied. There is no one-off solution. Ungraspable concepts of 21st century-politics remain as they are for most of the decision-makers of the party, ungraspable. With the advent of the social media, the alacrity at which information travels from its source to the Smartphones or laptops has transformed not only the volume of information; it has affected the initial quality of data and substance of matters. Gossip soon became gospel and before the real truth comes out another string of gossip and rumours have followed with the same intensity and latent power such gossips and rumours contain within themselves. Authenticity and veracity has been the unintended casualty in this process.
A very few amongst the present crop of UNP-Parliamentarians have grasped that and those who understood that power, were elected to the new politburo of the party. Yet in the context of these unique innovations in technology, there are some fundamentals of politics that have remained relevant and crucial to the present day dynamic of power politics. Specialization, distribution of labour and delegation of responsibility with corresponding authority as superior management principles have not been replaced by any of this modern-day gadgetry. If one wants to succeed in politics of any era, such fundamental principles need close attention from those who try to exploit the varying vagaries of the profession.
The UNP, stuck in a morass of an abysmal performance at the LG polls, with a devastating effect on its leader who has managed to survive a no-confidence motion, once again has made an unambiguous attempt, more on the sustenance of its leader than itself. It is almost beyond dispute that the general feeling among a vast majority of UNPers that a change at the helm is part of the package of changes they were expecting. But it is quite inane of them to expect that. Ranil Wickremesinghe is going nowhere. His manoeuvering and navigational skills have reached their zenith. Ousting him from the party leadership is not going to happen. They had better resign themselves to that reality now, not later. However, whether Ranil Wickremesinghe is going to be the next presidential candidate from the UNP is altogether a different subject. That is the hub these party rebels need to concentrate on now.
As much as the ordinary voters in the country vote to elect a president or a Member of Parliament, the elementary mindset of the UNP Working Committee is not different from that of any other voter in the country -- they are all just voters who want a winner as against a loser. Electing a nominee for the forthcoming presidential elections in 2020 is another matter altogether. In a real sense, this proposition of electing a nominee is a making of Ranil Wickremesinghe himself. Having failed to place confidence in himself as a plausible and winning candidate -- Sarath Fonseka in 2010 and Maithripala Sirisena in 2015 -- Ranil has given enough and more reasons to UNP members, at grassroots level as well as district, provisional and national level leaders that the slot of nomination is an open, not a closed decision.
Its inescapable that those who would like or hate Navin and Sajith, would factor in their respective likes and dislikes for their fathers and the tremendous work of their fathers will have an unequivocal effect on their final choice
This is where the focus of Sajith Premadasa and Navin Dissanayake, the only two second-tier leaders in the party in whom much confidence and surety by the party membership has placed, should be. A battle to dethrone Ranil Wickremesinghe from party leadership is not a realistic proposition. It will tear the party apart. But a fight for nomination to contest the presidential elections would appear to be a more legitimate contest. Ever since Ranil Wickremesinghe took over the party after Gamini Dissanayakes untimely death in 1994, he, as the leader of party, declined to contest on his own partys ticket on two decisive occasions, 2009 and 2015. That is an extremely-adverse precedent to set for a party leader. Most of the criticism aimed at Ranil Wickremesinghe is centering on that precedent set by him. For a party leader to forego an opportunity of such significance and magnitude could be construed as a betrayal of the partys principles and core values.
Against such a convoluted backdrop, development of other personalities, specifically those of Navin Dissanayake and Sajith Premadasa whose fathers, Gamini Dissanayake and R. Premadasa respectively who literally gave their lives for the party, is a natural progression of political dynamics. But one must remember when evaluating Navin and Sajith, albeit its provocative component to compare the personalities of the two fathers and their respective contributions to the party and the country, they must be evaluated completely independent of their fathers achievements. What R. Premadasa and Gamini Dissanayake did for the UNP and Sri Lankas socio-economical-political development is unmatchable.
Yet its inescapable that those who would like or hate Navin and Sajith, would factor in their respective likes and dislikes for their fathers and the tremendous work of their fathers will have an unequivocal effect on their final choice. But there remains one singular factor which would not change. Especially in the context of what was mentioned earlier in this column about voters electing a winner as against a loser, the performance of Navin Dissanayake and Sajith Premadasa at the LG elections concluded in February 2018, does matter.
Lets do an analysis of the LG elections results for Navin and Sajith
(Source: Ada Derana Website)
The UNP has been clearly swept in the Hambantota District. Despite the UNP winning the Hambantota MC, it failed to form the council which again reflects badly on Sajiths organisational skills.
A close scrutiny of the above statistical table reveals that the unconfirmed yet widely-rumoured stories by the media and other interested parties that Sajith Premadasa has a better and firmer hold on the electorate, especially the Sinhalese Buddhist faction, is shattered. Sajith Premadasa has found a very credible and a better results-producing competitor in Navin Dissanayake. The irony, however, is that until about two months ago Sajith had a free field as far as successors to Ranil Wickremesinghe were concerned.
The LG elections coupled with Navin being the UNPer to receive the highest number of votes at the election of the UNP politburo among its Working Committee members cum Parliamentarians has catapulted Navin Dissanayake to be a force to be reckoned with. It was also reported that at this meeting when some member suggested another name for deputy leader position in the party, Sajith immediately got up and stated that he would resign from his deputy leadership position if that happened. This selfish rush to protect his turf is not a sign of a good, self-confident and secure leader.
Sajith is known to be a loner. Yet his dedication to his ministry work and Buddhist temples has cut quite a unique figure among some of the neo-liberal ministers in the UNP-led government. His tireless work in the Hambantota District and adjacent districts, especially among poorer class of people reminds of the work done by his late father, R. Premadasa.
On the other end of the spectrum, Navin Dissanayake too seems to be fairly conversant with, among others, parliamentary procedures, political strategizing and tactics and above all winning votes. A winning politician, apart from substantiating the confidence people have in the competitors, has some other remarkable side to it. That is its unique character of standing out as an enabler of optimism among the supporters which generates enthusiasm to work harder and go to the polls. That unique character in a winner cannot be transformed into a contagious trait among many unless and until a unique and remarkable campaign based on modern and scientific political campaign principles is launched and executed to its finality. Beginning from branding, choosing its unique selling proposition (USP), multi-tiered delegation, precise scheduling, more than adequate transport facilities, more than a significant amount of money and manpower and ability to change course midway without causing damage to the original plan and objectives are all parts of a good plan.
But execution remains the most critical and game-changing element of the whole campaign. Whoever has the edge on these crucial parts of the equation wins the game. Both Navin and Sajith have a fight to fight.

About to move from Walawe to Nilwala
	

A Betel leaf bigwig hailing from Ruhuna has decided to shift his political base to another district, they say.

The politico has already apprised his close political and other associates of his decision to move over to an electorate close to Nilwala ganga which is home to many of his friends and close relations.
The Betel leaf stalwart suffered a marked decline in voter support in his Walawe electorate following his pro-Maitri role in the recent no-confidence affair. Therefore, he had decided to shift to a constituency where he could enjoy more popular support and feel more at home rather than ride the elephant-back, they say.

Advantis Projects Provides Logistics Expertise to CEB
	
Continuing its leadership in logistics in Sri Lanka, Advantis Projects, the project logistics arm of Hayleys Advantis Limited,recently secured and completed the transportation of 12 transformersand their respective accessories as part of the Ceylon Electricity Boardsproject - Construction Of Grid Substations, Greater Colombo Transmission And Distribution Loss Reduction. Amongst the cargo were two 250MVA transformerswhich weighed 131 tonnes each,making it the highest capacity cargo project handled by a local company in Sri Lanka. The remaining cargo was made up of two 50 tonne transformers and eight 70 tonne transformers.
The original contract for the project was won by a Korean company which then awarded the local logistics component to Advantis Projects based on their technical knowledge, capabilities and experience. Rising to the challenge Advantis Projects was able to provide an incident-free complete end-to-end solution for the transportation of these transformers from clearanceat the Colombo Port to multiple locations within the greater Colombo area.
The project required the use of equipment such as specialised trailers, high capacity cranes, 400T synchronised jacking systems and skidding/sliding tracks, which were all available to Advantis Projects through their own range of equipment. It also required novel methods for the successful execution of the project. One such method involved the movement of the 250MVA (131Tonne) transformers, utilizing synchronized skidding/sliding tracks.
Due to space limitations at the location where the transformers were unloaded,cranes could not be used for the precise final placement of the units. This required the Advantis engineers to devise an innovative method to push the transformers into a narrow space. In a first for Sri Lanka, the Advantis team laid down a special skidding track that allowed them to slowly but precisely push the transformers into place. Advantis Projects is currently the only local company to own such skidding tracks, which were designed and engineered with in-house expertise. This ingenuity in moving heavy cargo is a testament to Advantis Projects commitment to innovation by benchmarking with European standards to improve their capabilities.
The Ceylon Electricity Boards project intends to improve the quality and reliability of electricity in the greater metropolitan area by minimizing power loss. This will require the introduction of low-loss power transmission and distribution lines, and the construction of new substations. However, the success of this project will rely just as much on the ability and ingenuity of logistics providers to transport these sophisticated machines to their respective locations, as it will on the engineers installing them.
In the past,projects of this magnitude were handled by costly foreign entities due to a lack of local skill and expertise. However, today, with Advantis Projects leading the way by investing in the development of local talent and increasing their capabilities by acquiring specialised equipment, the local industry has matured and gained the necessary expertise to cater to the needs of local and foreign players in the transportation of their heavy cargo.
Our wholly owned specialised equipment and innovative special projects teamhas always helped Advantis Projects to go above and beyond in meeting our clients needs with tailor-made solutions, said Shadil Rizan, General Manager, Advantis Projects. This was exactly the case with this latest project that put our ingenuity and capabilities to the test. Our successful, incident-free completion of the project is a testament to the strides the local industry has taken in recent years and speaks volumes of our ability to cater to a myriad of client needs.
A subsidiary of Hayleys Advantis Limited, Advantis Projects is the market leader in providing project logistics solutions to local and international contractors who are involved in large-scale infrastructure development projects. The company brings over two decades of experience and a proven delivery record that has been driven with technology innovation and adherence to industry best practices. The company specializes in project & general cargo handling, inland transportation, freight, chartering, customs clearance & forwarding (C&F), storage facilities and numerous services related to logistics chains.

By the Sri LankaAssociation of Inbound Tour Operators (SLAITO)
	
This statement is in response to the Coast Conservation Department (CCD) decision to suspend the removal of 17 identified unauthorized establishments in the Mirissa coastal belt until further notice:
In the wake of the tourism industry crisis, triggered by the brutal attack on Dutch tourists at a beach bar in Mirissa, Hon. John Amaratunga proactively called all stakeholders to meet together without delay. The Sri Lanka Police, the Ministry of Law and Order, the SLTDA and the CCD were present at the meeting where the Minister assured them and the tourism fraternity as a whole, that swift action would be taken to ensure the removal of unauthorized constructions in the area.
On receiving his assurances, SLAITO in turn assured foreign tour operators that the issue was under control and is being appropriately managed by the relevant authorities.
However, we were disturbed to learn, that days later, the Coastal Conservation Department has decided to suspend the removal of illegal constructions on the Mirissa and Weligama coastal belt until further notice, going against assurances given to the tourism industry, the previous week. SLAITO members are disappointed to hear about the suspension as this issue is being monitored by tour operators who are waiting to see a swift response from authorities as they are responsible for the safety of tourists they send to Sri Lanka.
The illegal establishments identified for removal are a compliance and safety risk and have resulted in creating a dangerous and unsafe perception of Sri Lanka tourism. This is probably the worst public relations for the country at a time when the government is relying on the tourism sector to bring in precious foreign exchange.
SLAITO entreats the Government to proceed with the initial decision, as not coming down hard and strong on such attacks against tourists will effectively kill the industry and keep tourists away for fear of more such attacks. Undoubtedly, by suspending the effective and punitive measures that were taken, other disruptive elements will be emboldened to copy such attacks which go against the culture and hospitality of Sri Lanka itself.
At a time when the country is striving to earn foreign exchange, the growing influx of tourists not only supports the economy but also creates livelihoods for many along the supply chain. Therefore, any leniency in implementing the law, especially in a high profile case such as this; which has received worldwide attention, will result in negative word-of-mouth publicity that will take years to correct. 
However, if swift and decisive action is taken at Mirissa as publicly announced by the Minister of Law and Order to remove illegal establishments, coupled with punitive action against the culprits, it will send out a strong message to the world that Sri Lanka respects tourists and that their safety is of paramount importance.

get away. 
According to local media, the building was 26-floors tall and formerly served as the headquarters of the Sao Paulo districts federal police.

Five victims paid Rs.1.8mn to release gifts sent via social media fraudster's accounts: CERT
	
The Computer Emergency Readiness Team Co-ordination Centre (CERT|CC) said today it had recorded complaints from five people who had paid a total of more than Rs.1.8 million to the accounts of social media fraudsters to get their gift items released from Customs.
Its Principal Information Security Engineer Roshan Chandragupta said five instances had been reported since last December about social media fraudsters requesting gullible users to pay customs duties to get their gifts released and sent to them.
Many use websites such as Facebook, WhatsApp, Viber to connect with friends most of whom are not known to them, Mr. Chandragupta said and added that some local fake Facebook account holders even pretend to be foreigners. They send friend requests to other account holders in an attempt to build some kind of rapport and for chatting, share images and even send wishes and gifts to these friends with whom they share their sorrow and happiness and give advices as well. Shortly thereafter these victims say they have received boxes containing gifts such as electrical items or jewellery and money was in the box to pay Customs clearance fees if necessary.
Mr Chandragupta said the fraudsters frighten the victims warning them to not to go to the Customs Department to get their gifts released and they (the fraudsters) would sorted it out by paying the customs duty and send them the money to do so.
He advised the public not to fall prey to such scams. (Chaturanga Samarawickrama)

Glyphosate ban lifted for tea, rubber industries: Navin
	
The ban on the Glyphosate weedicide has been lifted for tea and rubber industries with effect from today following the approval of President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, Plantation Industries Minister Navin Dissanayake said.
Minister Dissanayake told a news conference that the government had reached this decision considering the economic damage the ban had caused to the tea and rubber sectors.
The economic damage it has done was too excessive and also there were no real scientific evidence to link Glyphosate with chronic kidney disease of unknown etiology (CKDu). Accordingly, the ban was lifted for tea and rubber industries, he said.
The government is planning to replace Glyphosate with an organic herbicide within the next 3-4 years, he added.
He said the estimated loss of annual yield for the tea industry was Rs. 33.2 million while reduction of export earnings was estimated to be Rs 26.7 billion per year with the ban on Glyphosate.
He also said a Cabinet paper would be presented during the next week seeking the Cabinets approval on the said decision. (Nishel Fernando)

## Title: Impact of  gas price  increase on cost of living
## Section: Opinion
## Date: 2 May 2018 12:55 am
Impact of  gas price  increase on cost of living
	
Cost of livingand gas prizes
Cost of living is proportionate to, and depends on the prices of the consumer items and the management of the economy and trade by the governance. Gas plays a main role in cost of living. This is because the use of gas is fast increasing due to the shortage of traditional wood and want of clear, fast, energetic and convenient energy. Every drop of gas is imported in liquid form and distributed by two main companies Litro and Laugfs with full monopoly on trade and distribution. Gas prices have been revised/increased again by virtue of Section 18 of the Consumer Affairs Authority act as an essential item to the consumer when the prices of other consumer articles are outside price control under act no 9 of 2003 where only a limited number of consumer articles could be placed under price control. Every drop of gas imported, which is mainly used in cooking and food industry as the main source of clean energy in place of traditional wood, contributes to environment issues. The subject minister identifies the consumer items he considers essential based on a research by the CAA and will declare by a Gazette notification certain items as essential with the maximum price for the items being declared.
Milk powder and cement are among some of the 30 items identified with maximum prices. Here the trader is free to sell other items freely at the chosen prices with a price tag which is a requirement under the regulations in the second part of the CAA act. It is informed that the price of a gas cylinder has gone up by Rs. 245 when the Gas prices in the international market have dropped from 590 USD to 450 USD based on ARAMCO standards which is a subsidiary of the Saudi Arab and Private syndicate on monitoring world oil prizes. A completed procedure is to be adopted by the CAA with an official inquiry conducted by members appointed with experts to decide on the prices generally contested in the highest courts. This procedure will take place if the companies are not satisfied with the increase in prices. Unfortunately no consumer organizations are concerned or intervene on behalf of the consumer unlike in other parts of the world where the consumer is organized and powerful.
Consumer not organized in Sri Lanka
The consumer in Sri Lanka is not organized as in other parts of the world in protecting and enhancing their due rights under the legal system. They accept whatever is given by the trader, manufacturer, industrialist, and the state (regulator  that is the Consumer Affairs Authority) in the absence of a vigilant and a powerful consumer movement. In the United Kingdom the Consumer movement and media (with magazine WHICH the powerful consumer magazine) are in the forefront working together assisted by  DTI Department of Trade and Industry the main regulator in UK on consumerism.
EU, India, and other parts of the world consumerism is organized and powerful unlike Sri Lanka. Gas, a clean and cheap form of energy utilized in the household, and is now spread in the villages as a necessity in the household and industry- especially food industry on a large scale, which has a direct impact on cost of living with price increases on increase of gas. Traditional methods of generating energy have been replaced by the gas industry which is monopolized by two leading giants Laugfs and Litro (previously Shell) all over the country. This has made a direct impact on the cost of living. They have the countrywide network of distribution as a necessary consumer item which has a direct political and economic impact on the citizen and the state.
Why only gas as a source of energy
Every drop of gas, which is a by-product in the oil industry, is imported and stored in terminals in liquid form and distributed by the network of the two companies. These companies are now demanding price increases via the regulator Consumer Affairs Authority, which has the authority under Section 18 of the CAA act to permit companies the increase of prices on an application made. This is of course after due consideration by the regulator on the justification of the request having considered all aspects of the demand for the increase.
Gas is a protected item under the CAA with few other items declared by a gazette notification to control the maximum price to ease the consumer in the receiving end while protecting the trader who is expected to be fair and reasonable. Gas has become so important to the consumer and industrialist. Hence gas has become a powerful voice of the citizen to maintain the price to combat fast-growing cost of living due to other factors and price increases of food and consumer items. Gas is often used in place of fuel in many countries for cheap and clean energy. The traditional wood, the main source of energy, has an impact on environment which leads to deforestation and climatic issues. Many other innovative methods of cheap, clean and environmental friendly methods were introduced, but not properly marketed by the state institutions. Coconut/Paddy husk, Bio Gas, solar Energy, Energy Saving methods and many types of alternative energy were usedwithout success.
Effect on cost of living
Gas prices have a direct effect and impact on the cost of living. These prices increase the cost of the householders and affects bakeries, consumers, industrial products and food/ consumer items. This is because gas is one of the main sources of energy next to electricity. Electricity is expensive. Unfortunately with the increase of gas prices there would be disproportionate price increases of all consumer items, which are not controlled by the CAA. The CAA is the main regulator responsible for the price increase.
CAA is expected to make a decision considering the circumstances heavily contested by the powerful companies with the legal team in higher courts which often obtain their redress with high pressure legal and political as the inquiring officers at the CAA. Members of this board are influenced by the Minister in charge who always takes political decisions. The politically appointed Chairman of this board is often not competent to handle a difficult or crucial situation. We take this opportunity to demand the State to make arrangements to appoint an independent, competent and educated individual as the chairman of the CAA Chairman. This position is filled by an appointee named by the Constitutional Council.
The role of CAA
CAA is the main Player/Regulator in combating cost of living. There have been a series of deciding cases on this contentious issue, which has a direct political and economic impact on the country. Careful consideration is necessary regarding this issue. It is inevitable that the companies will take to litigation if they are not satisfied with the new price formula. Arriving at a compromise or finding a solution may not be easy especially with the incompetent and inefficient top ranking officers of the state institutions.
The CAA is an ineffective institution which has enormous powers to act on behalf of the public. It is learned that the Government is contemplating on meeting the authorities of the CAA in order to find ways of combating the rising cost of living. This they hope to do through the recently formed Apex body which will handle the economy! CAA is the best available main regulator responsible to the public in combating cost of living. The CAA has the authority to deal with consumer organizations and is active in educating the consumer, industrialist and trader to establish a proper consumer regime. How many consumer organizations have been formed and whether a single organization is active is a matter for the consumer to judge.

However, some interested parties decided to check the owner of the vehicle through the registration number before going to town with the story.

The honorary medal received with the Ranamayura Golden Peacock Award conferred upon legendary Sri Lankan film-maker Dr Lester James Peries had been stolen from his residence this morning while his funeral service was in progress, Chairman National Film Corporation of Sri Lanka Sitendra Senaratne said.
The NFC Chairman told Daily Mirror that a family member had confirmed that the medal had gone missing. According to the family member the award is suspected to have gone missing from his residence at around 10.30a.m after the Catholic rituals had been performed. A family doctor who had come to get a photograph after the hearse carrying the coffin left the residence and had found the award missing.
A complaint had been lodged with the Bambalapitiya Police about this incident over the phone, Mr Senaratne said. "Dr Peries was the recipient of several Golden Peacock Awards from the International Film Festival of India during his lifetime and this stolen souvenir was the most valuable among them. It is thought the souvenir was made out of a precious metal," he said.
I informed the Law and Order Minister Ranjith Madduma Bandara and the Colombo South Police DIG about this theft as soon I came to know of it, Mr Senaratne said.
The Ranamayura Award was given to Mr Peries in 1965 at the India International Film Festival held in New Delhi for the film Gamperaliya, he said.
Meanwhile, the Police Media Division said the complaint was received by them between 10.15a.m and 11.00a.m and that the Bambalapitiya Police was conducting further investigations. (Chaturanga Samarawickrama)

Lester; Sri Lankas greatest story ever told
	
One of Sri Lankas greatest stories of recent times-- a story that may never be told againcomes to a sublime end today when a grateful nation and the government give a state funeral with full honours at Independence Square to Dr. Lester James Peries, a genius widely acclaimed as the Father of Sri Lankan cinema. After a prolonged illness he went to his eternal rest significantly on Vesak night when Sri Lanka marks the birth, enlightenment and death of Gautama the Buddha. 
For about six decades, since the Rekhawa revolution of 1956, Dr. Peries lifted Sinhala cinema to national and international fame with more than 20 masterpieces ranging from Sandeshaya and Gamperaliya to Nidhanaya and Delowak Athara. In one of his last interviews Dr. Peries who is ranked with Indias legendary Satyajit Ray and Japans Akira Kurosawa said he was essentially self-taught and one of the greatest lessons of his life was to learn from his mistakes.
Some of the Sinhala cinemas other giants, in a television interview on Monday said that besides his extraordinary and unparallelled talent in cinema work, Dr. Peries was much loved and respected by film actors, actresses, other members of the cast and technical crew for his great humanity. Among the virtues they identified were his sincerity and humility.
He sought not personal gain or glory, power or privileges but glory did come to him and perhaps even a century later we will be talking about Dr. Peries and his great or noble achievements. One of these many achievements was that his films were appreciated and acclaimed not only by the intellectuals here and overseas but even by the common people who saw deep meaning in his films though there was no sex or sensation as from Hollywood or Bollywood.
For instance when he wanted to make a film out of Martin Wickremesinghes famous novel Gamperaliya, the writer was not too keen and told Dr. Peries it would be difficult if not impossible to make a good film out of it. But nothing was impossible for Dr. Peries and Gamperaliya turned out to be one of the greatest films made in Sri Lanka and also won international awards or honours. Playwright Ediriweera Sarachchandra championed the film, writing At last a Sinhala film has been made which we could show the world without having to hide our heads in shame. I want to say a great film has been made of a great novel.
Dr. Peries had the qualities of Rudyard Kiplings Man. He kept his head above his shoulders while others around were losing theirs and blaming it on him. He trusted himself when others doubted him and more so made allowance for their doubting too. He waited and was not tired by waiting and even if he was lied about did not deal with lies. He could meet with triumph or disaster and treated those two impostors just the same. Dr. Peries filled every unforgiving minute with sixty seconds of distance well run or a film well done.
In deed as the well-known poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow would say, the heights reached by noble people, reached and kept, were not attained by sudden plight; but they, while their compatriots slept, were toiling upward in the night. So did Dr. Peries. He worked day and night with meaning and direction, drive determination and dynamism though at times he had to face near bankruptcy after making Rekhawa and some other films.
For Sri Lanka Dr. Peries was what Shakespeare was to Britain and the world. As Mark Anthony said at Caesars funeral oration, His life was gentle, and the elements so mixed in him that nature might stand up and say to all the world, This was a man.
Dr. Periess last wish was that a State sponsored film archives be set up to restore and preserve Sri Lankan films. As he is laid to rest today his soul would perhaps whisper the famous Psalm, Goodness and mercy all my life shall surely follow me and in Gods house forever more, my dwelling place shall be.

Australia, (Daily Mail), 1 May 2018 - Australias oldest scientist plans to fly business class to Switzerland next week to end his life. 
Dr David Goodall, a former university lecturer from Western Australia, doesnt have a terminal illness but says he regrets having reached the age of 104 as his quality of life continues to deteriorate. 
I greatly regret having reached that age, he told the ABC. 
Im not happy. I want to die. Its not sad particularly. What is sad is if one is prevented. 
If one chooses to kill oneself, then that should be fair enough. I dont think anyone else should interfere.Dr Goodall was born in London in 1914, and is an eminent botanist and ecologist. 
He came to Australia in 1948, taking up a lecturing position at the University of Melbourne. 
Dr Goodall celebrated his 104th birthday in early April and has since decided it is time to access voluntarily euthanasia in Switzerland.

Mired by Multiple Loan Sharks
	
Taking a close look at the growing household debts in the North and EastIt is opined that there should be debt counselling or a service whereby debtors can come to an amicable settlement with the creditors
After a nearly three-decade civil war those devastated by it had to rebuild their lives and finding employment was a challenge. The strategy adopted by the Government was to expand credit and promote self-employment. But then things took a turn for the worse when their livelihoods did not flourish. People could not repay the mounting debts. The once war-torn areas of the country are now mired by multiple loans which include predatory microfinance loans and loans provided by informal lenders at exorbitant interest rates.Failed attempts at self-employment coupled with accumulating high interest loans have now driven families to the brink of poverty. 
In October last year a heavily indebted mother committed suicide consuming poison mixed ice-cream which she had given to her three children, who died alongside her. Sources told Daily Mirror that some women migrated to the Middle East as housemaids to repay the loans. Some women, unable to pay loans, have gone into hiding leaving behind children. Profit oriented microfinance companies and informal lenders harass, threaten and pressurize them in an attempt to collect the monies that are due. Their target is most often than not poor rural women. Some microfinance institutions provide loans only to women.
Some women migrated to the Middle East as housemaids to repay the loans
	They also have to repay the loans obtained upon pawning which are between15-21%
	The effective interest rate when calculated was between 40% and 220%
	In the North and East, womens groups have spoken to the Government Agents in areas like Batticaloa, Kilinochchiand Jaffna
Political Analyst and Economist based in Jaffna, Ahilan Kadirgamar said that the strategy adopted by the Government to promote self-employment after the war by obtaining loans was a flawed strategy. Those affected by the war for decades had a lot more competition in the market and found it hard to earn a living using loans. When they couldnt generate an income they started pawning their jewellery,he said. 
At the same time microfinance companies started expanding. Kadirgamar said that the loans provided came with high interest. People are already indebted by bank loans which were provided at subsidized interest rates like 8%. The banks also provided self-employment loans in the order of 14% and so on. They also have to repay the loans obtained upon pawning which are between 15-21%, he said. 
Effective interest between 40% and 220%
He pointed out that though the interest levied by microfinance companies was between 24% and 28% the effective interest rate when calculated was between 40% and 220%. These are very predatory loans and people are not aware of it also because their loan sheets say they will be paying an interest of 24%-28%, he said, adding that people did not understand the loan conditions. He said the microfinance companies merely asked for the NIC and people did not have to provide security for the loans obtained. 
Microfinance loans are required to be paid monthly or weekly or daily depending on the type of agreement. They have to start paying part of the principal and the interest starting the first week or so. So you havent used the money for anything and youre already starting to pay back the loan. So when you calculate the effective annual interest rate it is so high, he said. In other words, irrespective of the fact that the repayment has to be made immediately, microfinance companies require a dividend of the principal and the interest for a year to be paid in the weekly or monthly installments etc. 
There is no way the rural women who take these loans are going to make an income. These loans are a form of exploitation. In many rural areas you find women who have taken multiple loans, but no real production nor real self-employment happens through that, he said. 
The loans obtained by different microfinance companies are known by the days of the week, as Monday loan, Tuesday loan etc. They signify the day of week that agents from a particular microfinance company would visit the village to collect payment. Loans are provided by these companies to groups of threes or fives. Speaking to the community workers attached to the Suriya Womens Development Center referring to the experience of debtors in a village in Batticaloa said that when one person did not pay, others in the group were held responsible. Even if youre pregnant or you have small children youre not allowed to leave the place until the amount owed by the person who hasnt paid, is settled, said S.Ariyamalar, a community worker. 
Many told us that these microfinance companies use a naming and shaming strategy to compel people to repay the loans. 
They even stay in front of the houses of the women who are in debt, intimidating them, until the money is paid, Ariyamalar said. 
When unable to pay the debt owed to one microfinance company women often borrow money from other microfinance companies and informal money lenders at very high interest rates. Even these money lenders end up harassing women who are unable to repay. Police complaints are made. The police file a case before court. But court proceedings are very slow and there have been instances where disputes have led to violence, said A.Elangaeswary, another community worker. 
She further said that lorries arrive at this village selling household appliances on an installment basis. Villagers initially pay around Rs. 200 to take possession of the appliance. However, they end up obtaining loans to pay the installments. When women are unable to repay, the appliance is forcibly taken away and the money that has already been paid is not returned, she said. She further said that aspirations in the post-war context to rebuild their lives and to climb the social ladder have made villagers purchase such appliances. 
Protest in February
In February this year a protest was held in Jaffna with around 3000 participants demanding action against predatory microfinance companies. The statement handed over by theJaffna District Cooperative Council to the Jaffna GA and the Governor of the Northern Province attributes the crisis to the lack of opportunities for employment and sustainable livelihoods along with the worrying expansion of financial institutions. 
Their demands are as follows: 
Ban all microfinance companies that use unethical and illegal practices. 
	Impose an interest rate cap with an effective annual interest rate not exceeding 25% so that all predatory loan schemes are immediately stopped. 
	Cancel all existing predatory microfinance loans or provide a moratorium for two years necessary to restart sustainable economic activity. 
	Expand low interest Government credit schemes that can generate sustainable rural livelihoods and rebuild our economy. 

Deteriorating conditionsat home
She further said that some women were in hiding which led to deteriorating conditions at home. There is no one to look after the children. Children dont go to school. And there is no food for them, she said. In the absence of their mothers, children are often questioned about their mothers whereabouts. This has led to the harassment of children and they are mentally affected as a result, she said. The also learned that some women have had to migrate and work as housemaids to repay loans. 
In certain female headed households the pressure to repay loans has caused women to enter into relationships with men, she said. 
The two community workers said that what was deeply concerning was that apart from being debt ridden, women lose the few assets they own such as land or jewelry in an attempt to pay off the mounting debts. 
These microfinance companies care only about repayment. They have grand objectives saying that it is for poverty alleviation, livelihood development, improving the economic condition. But all they do is to give the money and make sure it is repaid, Ariyamalar said. 
The Secretary of the Co-operative Council of the Jaffna District, Vethavalli Selvaratnam said that agents from microfinance companies make home visits and easily brainwash women into accepting microfinance loans. With regard to houses built after the war women have the desire to buy TVs and refrigerators etc, she said pointing to a dangerous trend. Further, women accept these loans without the knowledge of the husband, she said. Unemployed women have no income. They are afraid to ask for money from their husbands too because they have not told them. Then they pawn the jewellery they possess, she said. There are also households where there are broken marriages because of microfinance loans, she said. 
She further said that the microfinance loan forms were in English and most did not understand the content within. The forms say that if you dont pay the first week, you have to pay an additional amount. But these women arent aware of this, she said. 
She further said that women who work for daily wages work overtime to repay these loans and cut down on the amount of food and milk given to their children.
 
Meanwhile, Raga Alphonsus, the Programme Advisor to ZOA-an NGO based in Kilinochchi and Mannar- said that after the war the Government and humanitarian actors offered livelihood packages to families affected by the war in the North and East. However, this package was not timely and inadequate in most instances. In the fishing community, for example, fishermen had to borrow money to purchase the necessary fishing gear. 
In the village of Nachchikuda a woman borrowed money from a microfinance company so her 28-year-old husband could go fishing. They had borrowed Rs. 40 000 at an interest of 26% to purchase the necessary fishing nets. They were expected to pay the principal amount and the interest in 48 weekly instalments. However, the 28-year-old husband lost his nets and there was no income generating. His wife borrowed a second loan from another microfinance company, at an interest rate 26%, so as to repay the first loan. As a result they were required to pay two loans a week. Unable to sustain the family the husband has now mortgaged the house, also at a 26% interest. Currently they have to pay three loans a week and they are at the risk of losing their home.
Another woman from the same area has obtained a loan of Rs. 150 000 at the interest rate of 60% in 2015. Her deed of the house has been provided as security. So far she has not been able to repay the money and there is pressure to transfer the house. 
Speaking to the a 32-year-old woman from Mannar said that she had obtained a loan from a microfinance company so that her husband could engage in paddy cultivation. But our cultivation was destroyed by the rain. There is no income and we cant pay these accumulating loans, she said. She had taken loans worth Rs. 5000 initially, then another Rs. 200 000 followed by another worth Rs. 300 000. 
Another 40-year-old woman, also from Mannar, said that she along with her sister and brother had borrowed Rs. 300 000 from a microfinance company to support a neighbour to set up a shop. The neighbour was unable to borrow the money himself because he had not repaid another loan obtained to purchase a bicycle, she said. He had previously requested them to get him a loan of Rs. 50 000 which he had repaid. So we thought hell pay this loan too, she said. The shop has closed down as no sufficient income was being generated. The neighbour has refused to pay back. As a result we are forced into paying the weekly loan. We even had to pawn our jewellery, she said. 
Speaking at a recent workshop on Debt and Micro Credit Niyanthini Kadirgamar of the Collective for Economic Democratization said that Government programs like Samurdhi, which are supposed to help people escape poverty, are in fact subsidizing the loan payments of microfinance companies, who were making huge profits. 
She questioned how a poor woman, who has very little assets, is expected to make investments. How can you expect her to generate an income to fulfill her household expenses and above that to be able to repay these loans she quizzed. 
Further, she pointed out that people blamed themselves for falling into debt traps. They think its their fault in getting into debt, because they are unable to manage their finances. The blame is transferred to individuals. We see this at Government level, at policy level. But when it comes to discussions at the ground level we dont talk about the fact that this is also structurally created. Its also about Government policy, she said. 
Political representatives in the North have been completely silent about this, she charged. 
Meanwhile, she said that the issue of microfinance affected not only the North and East, but also other parts in the island. She pointed to a lack of research in other parts of the country. She raised concern about factories offering microfinance loans tied to workers wages. In terms of the North and East whats also important is that unlike in other parts of the country, it seems that it is after 2009 that microfinance companies have mushroomed. It is that quick change within a short period of time and we have seen their impact in a more pronounced way in the North and East, she said.
She also said that resistance in proportion to the impact has been very less. Nevertheless, in the North and East, womens groups spoke to the Government Agents in Batticaloa, Kilinochchi and Jaffna and have asked to control these finance companies and their activities in the villages.
What needs tobe done
Microfinance Act
The Microfinance Act (No. 06 of 2016) provides for the licensing, regulation and supervision of companies carrying on microfinance business. Ahilan Kadirgamar said that though this Act gives the Central Bank the power to deploy an interest rate cap, the Central Bank has not implemented it. 
If they were to implement it that would set a standard, he said. 
He further pointed out that not all microfinance companies fall under the Microfinance Act as those which are only lending organizations are excluded. This needs to be changed, he stressed. 
Meanwhile, he said, the Central Bank has introduced a Customer Charter which talks about the rights of the customers in relation to microfinance companies. But in practice all these are infringed, he said. 
Kadirgamar said that Government Agents can be empowered to bring in rules which bar the agents of microfinance companies from entering certain towns. He further stressed that there should be more political will to address the situation. 
According to him, debts should either be forgiven or there should be a moratorium at a much lower interest rate, as in most cases, women find it impossible to pay back. 
The Budget for 2018 identifies indebtedness in the rural sector, targeted by exploitative microfinance schemes, as a serious issue. Accordingly Rs. 1000 million has been allocated to provide grants and introduce a low interest loan scheme to facilitate those indebted and to move out the debt trap through Co-operative Rural Banks and the Thrift and Credit Co-operative. It is to be implemented on a pilot basis in the North and the North Central Provinces. 
You have to provide alternate credit. That is where these Budget proposals come into play. When people are in dire need they can obtain these loans instead of going to money lenders in the village, he said.
No directions issued regarding interestrate cap-CBSL
W. Ranaweera, the Director of the Department of Supervision of Non-Bank Financial Institutions of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka(CBSL) said that the CBSL would regulate microfinance companies according to the Microfinance Act. Accordingly, certain directions have been issued and microfinance companies which fall under the purview of the CBSL are required to comply. 
However, he said that no directions have been issued regarding an interest rate cap. At the moment we have received only a limited number of applications, and even those are not qualified to be registered, he said. 
We have to first decide on how many companies should be regulated. Once the initial stage is complete we can address other issues.
We have to first decide on how many companies should be regulated. Once the initial stage is complete we can address other issues. Under the Act the regulator can issue directions. There may be a possibility of issuing directions with regard to interest rates etc. We can consider all this after analysing the total picture of the industry. We will have to visit the companies and obtain information,
he said. He said that companies which are merely lending institutions did not fall under its purview. But if they accept deposits they cant operate without registering with us, he said. 
Money Lending Ordinance
According to the Money Lending Ordinance with regard to informal loans above Rs. 2500 an interest rate above 15% per annum cannot be imposed. Alphonsus highlighted that money lenders violated such provisions, driving people into poverty and debt traps. Further, the Money Lending Ordinance also states that an interest which exceeds the principal amount is not recoverable. Hence on the part of the debtors there is no legal obligation to repay such debts. However, Alphonsus pointed out that debtors were often disempowered while creditors were very powerful. So they will not refuse payment, he said. 
Alphonsus said that money lenders often waited for the debt to be accumulated so that they can take ownership of the property. 
Debt Counselling
He further pointed out that in the event a business failed, despite the educated having the power to negotiate with banks with the help of financial experts and lawyers, such an option was not, in practical circumstances, available to villagers. He suggested that there should be debt counselling or a service whereby debtors can come to an amicable settlement with the creditors. This is the only way to demand some kind of accountability from the loan sharks, he said. 
This is a total trap. These people are war victims. Theres a lot of stress at home and children are at the butt-end of it all. Women are pressurised to feed their children and men go and drink alcohol, which makes the situation worse, said Alphonsus. 
Why not banks
As a result of debts already owed to banks and stringent requirements at banks to obtain loans people prefer obtaining loans from microfinance companies where the requirements are flexible. Alphonsus said that most, especially in the fisheries sector, were blacklisted due to non-payment of loans obtained soon after resettlement without adequate due diligence and therefore could not apply for loans from banks. Further, the requirements to be fulfilled, including guarantors with a stable income to obtain a loan from a bank, also make people reluctant to approach the banks. You also need to build a good track record in the bank to obtain a loan. A lot of paper work is required. You also need to travel a long distance several times to access banks whereas agents from these finance companies come to your house, he said. 
Meanwhile, he made a distinction between social service oriented microcredit institutions and money minded micro-credit institutions. He pointed out that the social service oriented micro-credit institutions provide money for the well-being of the population. They charge a low interest so that they are able to maintain their staff. But profit oriented microfinance companies are ruthless when it comes to repayment, he said.

North and S. Korea start to dismantle border speakers
	

REUTERS, 01st MAY, 2018-North and South Korea began dismantling loudspeakers that blared propaganda across their heavily fortified border on Tuesday, South Koreas defense ministry said, fulfilling a promise made at last weeks historic summit.
The moves are the first practical, if small, steps toward reconciliation after Fridays meeting between South Korean President Moon Jae-in and the Norths Kim Jong Un.
Moon, meanwhile, asked that the United Nations help verify North Koreas planned shutdown of its Punggye-ri nuclear test site in a phone conversation on Tuesday with U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, a statement from the presidential Blue House said.
Guterres said the requests need approval from the U.N. Security Council, but he wanted to cooperate to build peace on the Korean peninsula and would assign a U.N. official in charge of arms control to cooperate with South Korea, the statement said.
Several days before Fridays summit, the North surprised the world by declaring it would dismantle the test site to transparently guarantee its dramatic commitment to stop all nuclear and missile tests.
The Punggye-ri site, where North Korea has conducted all six of its nuclear tests, consists of a system of tunnels dug beneath Mount Mantap in the northeastern part of the country.
Some experts and researchers have speculated the most recent - and by far largest - blast in September had rendered the entire site unusable. But Kim said there were two additional, larger tunnels that remain in very good condition.

PwCs Academy Corporate Planning Bootcamp in Colombo
	
The goal of most strategies is to build a lasting competitive advantage by establishing clever market positioning or assembling the right capabilities and competencies. Those that thrive reflect upon their previous actions and in doing so are quick to read and react to signals of change.
Most Sri Lankan companies have taken the initiative to expand their organizations into regional and in extension, global markets. As a result, strategic planning in these organizations have been given priority due to the significance it plays in carrying out the processes of expansion.
Businesses must view planning as an ongoing process and as such, should have a process in place for continually monitoring their environment and alerting the appropriate people to potential shocks which could be both internal and external. Just as the internal environment can shift causing organisations to revisit their planning efforts, so can the external environment. This rings true specifically, in the case of conglomerates. As the larger the organisation, the more complex their strategy planning would be, and the greater the repercussions of their actions.
PwCs Academy Sri Lanka has recognized the necessity and importance for strategy planning and given these developments within the Sri Lankan business environment, we have organized a workshop tailored to any and all the strategic needs of most Sri Lankan organisations.
A unique opportunity for all organisations to enhance their strategy planning with teachings of an expert faculty specializing in the subject topic: an ideal mentor for your training experience with practical and theoretical knowledge of business strategies required for the successful execution of a strategy.
Prof Susan Lynch is an Adjunct Professor of Strategy at INSEAD. She has a Ph.D. in Strategic and International Management from London Business School and teaches courses in strategy and strategy implementation to MBAs and executives. Her research lies at the intersection of strategy implementation and organizational change.
Her more recent work considers how networks shape individual and organizational identity and affect the success of chosen strategies. Prior to commencing her Ph.D., Professor Lynch spent over 7 years as a management consultant with McKinsey & Company in New York and Sydney, consulting to multinational companies on issues of corporate and business unit strategy and organizational change.
Due to the complexity of the subject matter, the program will be taking place over the course of two days, on 09 & 10 May 2018. It will be split into sessions where a topic is to be covered in each session along with a case study applicable to that topic.
This programme will bring local, regional and international cases including Uber, Apple, Walt Disney, LOLC Microcredit and more.
UBER Story in China
Uber will hand over its ride-hailing and UberEats food delivery services to Grab in in exchange for a 27.5% stake of the company. This means that Uber will cease and hand over all its operations in Cambodia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.
Although many speculated that a merger between the two companies was imminent, once SoftBank, an existing backer of Grab and several other Uber rivals, made clear its intentions to fund Uber, in August 2017.Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said thatOne of the potential dangers of our global strategy is that we take on too many battles across too many fronts and with too many competitors. We will discuss Ubers strategy in China and its challenges.
Apple Inc. - The Fall and Rise
The case study on Apple Inc. will examine how one of the most profitable computer companies in the world in the late 1980s and 1990s, fell into a slump soon after. The trainer will touch on the strategic efforts taken by its decision makers at the time revive this company and how it has progressed to being one of the largest multinational technology companies in the world, in particular, its sources of competitive advantage, its resources and its capabilities.
Walt Disney Co.  Maintaining and Dominating market presence
The case study on Walt Disney Company, will explore it has arguably been the most successful entertainment company in the world. In extension, the corporate scope from its international expansion to its range of businesses that have helped in sustaining this success
Reflective sessions  A chance to introspect your companys stratagy
Reflective sessions will also take place so that participants can have a group discussion on what they have learnt at the end of each day. In doing so, this will allow them to identify their own weaknesses and strengths and effectively set goals to strengthen their current corporate advantage.
LOLC Micro Credit
The programme will also cover the case study of LOLC Microcredit.Themicrofinance company within the LOLC group. Which has been serving the financial needs of the base of the pyramid through micro-leasing and group lending. A well-suited for teaching issues surrounding corporate social responsibility and creating shared value by integrating.

Rathana Thera condemns lifting Glyphosate ban
	
While condemning the governments decision to lift the ban on the Glyphosate weedicide for the tea and rubber industries, Parliamentarian Ven. Athuraliye Rathana Thera today said this decision was illegal.
Rathana Thera told Daily Mirror that the related authorities had taken this decision without going through an accurate procedure and added that the decision had been made without the gathering of the committee to probe into this matter.
Accordingly, the authorities cannot lift the ban on the Glyphosate for tea and rubber industries in such a manner. It is unlawful. We will take actions with this regard, the Thera said.
However, Rathana Thera has taken initiative in banning the use of Glyphosate in Sri Lanka for the past several years.
Plantation Industries Minister Navin Dissanayake today told a news conference that it was decided to lift the ban on Glyphosate for tea and rubber industries and added that discussions were held with President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe with this regard.
Minister Dissanayake said Cabinet approval would seek on lifting the Glyphosate ban on these specific industries during the next week.
However, Glyphosate ban on other cultivations including paddy will be continued. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)

Return to domestic cricket for national selection, SLC selectors warn Malinga
	
Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) selectors are reportedly upset with pacer Lasith Malinga for apparently wasting his time as bowling mentor of Indian Premier League (IPL) side Mumbai Indians and issued the 34-year-old an ultimatum to return home to play domestic cricket if he intended to be recalled to the national side, the NDTV reported.
Malinga, who last played for the Islanders more than seven months ago in the home series against India, was not retained by Mumbai Indians ahead of the 2018 season. He went unsold at the IPL auction and then opted for a stint as a mentor for the Mumbai Indians franchise. Malinga was named for Sri Lanka's domestic Inter-Provincial one-day tournament but prior to the announcement of the squads, which gets underway on Wednesday, Malinga posted a video message declining to play any domestic cricket until the IPL was over.
In the video, he had mentioned that he was ready to make an international comeback during the home series against South Africa in July. "The selectors will have to make a call in case Lasith doesn't play any domestic cricket," SLC President Thilanga Sumathipala was quoted as saying by cricbuzz on Tuesday.
"I do believe that we can make use of him for T20 Internationals. We wouldn't have had any problem had he been playing matches at the IPL, but the issue is that he is on the bench," remarked Sumathipala.
SLC CEO Ashley de Silva warned Malinga that his refusal to play in the domestic tournament may shut the door on his international selection.
"We have informed Lasith that he has been selected. If he doesn't play the Inter-Provincial tournament, it is unlikely that the selectors will consider him," de Silva said.
Since his return from injury, the fast bowler has taken just 10 wickets in 13 ODIs. South Africa will play five ODIs and a T20 International during their five-week tour of Sri Lanka that kicks off with a two-match Test series.
