Brexit has positive side effects on SL
	
Brexit or Britain leaving European Union has a positive side effect on Sri Lanka with the increase of the country?s foreign reserves by US $ 250 million, a Minister said yesterday.
During the question time in Parliament last week, Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake said the foreign reserves rose by this amount after Brexit.
Later, in a brief comment to Daily Mirror, the Minister said things were moving positively ever before Brexit. However, he said it precipitated developments in Sri Lanka?s favour after it happened.
?It is hot money going in for destinations. Our rates are good. People were speaking of us. Even before Brexit, things were coming in. When money is halted from going there, it has to go to safe destinations. When Sterling Pound is losing value, nobody wants to go after it. Then, the option is look for safe destination,? he said.
The Minister said the foreign reserves stood at over US $ 5 billion at the moment. However, it is still a drop against over US $ 8 billion the country had over a couple of years back.
Meanwhile, the government said earlier that Brexit would likely to have negative effects in the long run with Sri Lanka losing market access under concessionary traffic rates. Britain accounts for 40 per cent of Sri Lanka?s exports to Europe. (KB)

Call for referendum for ETCA approval - Gammanpila
	
Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) General Secretary MP Udaya Gammanpila? today challenged the Government to call for a referendum in order to seek public approval for the Economic and Technology Cooperation Agreement (ECTA).
Addressing a media briefing, MP Gammanpila said they would not agree on the ECTA if the Government is unable to seek public approval for the ECTA through a referendum. He also said signing such agreements would completely devastate the country?s independence.
?There is a saying in English literature that ?Do not catch anything that you cannot throw away?. This saying is applicable to the Governments? current situation. If Sri Lanka would sign an agreement with a huge country like India, our country would never be able to get rid of them in any circumstance,? he added. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)

Cameron to resign on Wednesday: Theresa May new PM
	
British Prime Minister David Cameron says he will step down on Wednesday, clearing the way for Theresa May to succeed him as prime minister this week, after Energy Minister Andrea Leadsom unexpectedly withdrew from the race to lead the Conservative Party.
Graham Brady, the head of the party committee running the contest, said the party board would meet to discuss confirming May as the winner. He did not say how long that might take.
The new Conservative leader will replace David Cameron as prime minister. He announced his resignation after the country voted in a referendum last month to leave the European Union. He had campaigned to stay in.
May, who also supported remaining in the EU, is one of the most experienced ministers in Cameron's Cabinet, serving in the notoriously difficult job of interior minister for six years. If confirmed, the 59-year-old politician could become Britain's prime minister within days. She would be the second woman to hold the job.
Leadsom's announcement came after a weekend uproar over her comments about the role of motherhood in politics. Leadsom at first defended, and then apologized for, an interview in which she said that being a mother "means you have a very real stake in the future of our country." Leadsom has children; May does not.
Leadsom later accused the Times of London newspaper of practicing "gutter journalism" and twisting her sentiments.
The Times released a recording of part of the interview to show it had quoted Leadsom accurately.
Before her announcement, Leadsom had apologized to May, telling Monday's Daily Telegraph newspaper that she believed that having children has "no bearing on the ability to be PM."
Leadsom said she was dropping out because she had concluded she lacked sufficient support among Conservative lawmakers. She added that "business needs certainty" in the wake of Britain's vote to leave the European Union, which has unsettled the markets and sent the value of the pound plunging.
"We now need a new prime minister in place as soon as possible," Leadsom said. The leadership vote among Conservative Party members had been due to run until early September.
Leadsom is the latest politician to fall in an extraordinary two-and a half weeks since the referendum. Aspiring leaders including former London Mayor Boris Johnson and Justice Secretary Michael Gove have all seen their hopes dashed amid political and economic turmoil.
Leadsom's rivals said both her comments on motherhood and her subsequent flip-flopping showed the junior energy minister lacked the experience under pressure required to be prime minister. Her allies accused supporters of May -- Britain's interior minister -- of attempting to undermine Leadsom.
Formally launching her campaign Monday before Leadsom's announcement, May tried to reassure supporters of a British exit that she would respect their decision.
She said "Brexit means Brexit" and promised that as leader she would not attempt to stay in the EU or "rejoin it by the back door."
British politics has been thrown into turmoil by the referendum result, which has sparked leadership struggles in both the governing Conservative and main opposition Labour parties.
Labour lawmaker Angela Eagle on Monday launched an attempt to unseat party leader Jeremy Corbyn, a veteran left-winger who has a strong base of support among Labour members but little backing from the party's 229 lawmakers.
Labour legislators have passed a no-confidence motion in Corbyn, and many of his top team in Parliament resigned from their jobs to protest his leadership. He is refusing to resign and says he can win a leadership battle, which would be decided by a vote of party members.
Many Labour lawmakers believe the staunchly socialist, resolutely uncharismatic Corbyn lacks broad appeal to voters. Eagle said he "doesn't connect enough to win an election." (Fox News)

LankaClear achieves highest ever revenue growth to reach Rs.600mn
	
LankaClear (Private) Limited, the operator of Sri Lanka?s national payment network LankaPay, held its 14th Annual General Meeting recently at Galadari Hotel, Colombo.
Incorporated in 2002 under the guidance and approval of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka as the National Cheque Clearing House, LankaClear is owned by the Central Bank and all the registered commercial banks in the country. The company, today, facilitates a host of domestic interbank payments on behalf of all member banks and financial institutes, under the brand name of LankaPay, providing the critical backbone network for the country?s banking and financial system.
LankaClear recorded an impressive 16 percent year-on-year growth in revenue compared to a 12 percent growth previous year, surpassing the Rs.600 million revenue threshold for the first time. This is the highest ever revenue growth recorded by the company since its incorporation, which is mainly attributable to the volume growth in new electronic payment instruments. Primarily owing to the significant revenue growth experienced during the latter part of the year, the company was able to successfully reverse the negative profit growth trend experienced during the two previous years, recording an impressive profit of Rs.174 million for the year compared to Rs.129 million a year ago.?
The company also maintained a healthy return on assets ratio of 12 percent and return on equity ratio of 13 percent during the year under review. LankaClear closed the year with a strong balance sheet with net assets reaching Rs.1.34 billion, which was a 12 percent growth compared to the previous year. The company also declared the highest ever dividend for the shareholders in 2015/16.
Continuing the increased rate of adoption of the previous year, the financial year 2015/16 saw an even greater penetration of electronic payments as opposed to the paper-based instruments.
The revenue from Cheque Imaging and Truncation System continued to be the most significant revenue stream with a contribution of 55 percent to the total revenue from operations for the year. Revenue from Common Card and Payment Switch (CCAPS) and Sri Lanka Interbank Payment System (SLIPS) continued the impressive upwards trend recording a remarkable 81 percent and 24 percent growth, respectively.?
During the year 2015/16, the total number of banks connected to the Common ATM Switch (CAS) grew to 14, while connecting over 3000 ATMs islandwide accounting for almost 90 percent of the total ATMs in the country. The total volume of inter-bank cash withdrawals grew to 14.18 million from 7.89 million in the preceding year with an average approved transactions of 54,586 a day.?
The Common Electronic Fund Transfer Switch launched in August 2015 saw an exponential growth with 15 members getting on board as at the year end. The total value of the transactions cleared through LankaPay CEFTS during the year stood at 5.74 billion.
Addressing the AGM, LankaClear Chairman Anil Amarasuriya stated, ?I am pleased to report that LankaClear has made significant progress towards developing and deploying a comprehensive common electronic payment network in the country. A key achievement for the company?
during the current financial year is the?
marked improvement in its financial health, evinced through strong revenue growth and improved profitability.?
Under the guidance of the Central Bank and the participation of all banks who are also the shareholders of the company, we were able to reach several significant milestones in our journey, whilst regaining momentum from a declining profitability trend experienced during the last couple of years. We will continue to consolidate and strengthen the country?s national payment network by driving electronic payments with the support of member banks and financial institutions, thereby assisting the nation to move towards a cashless economy.?
LankaClear General Manager and Chief Executive Officer Channa de Silva, commenting on the company?s performance said, ?We believed the remarkable growth that we experienced during the year under review is a testimony to the confidence reposed on us by our shareholders. Our?
focus at a broader national level was on facilitating financial inclusivity for all communities by leveraging on rapid technological advancements.?
We have been transferring this macro concept of financial inclusivity to implementation level by building a ?chain of trust? from end consumers and all the way back to LankaClear.?
At a micro level, our priority was to strengthen the company?s financial base through improved revenues and profit growth. This is in line with our commitment to invest in future technologies without having to depend on outside funding sources. Our focus for the year was to consolidate the products that were already deployed and implement a host?
of innovative electronic payment?
instruments to keep pace with rapidly changing technology landscape.?
During the current financial year, a number of new innovations such as Online US Dollar clearing facility, Common Electronic Fund Transfer Switch (CEFTS), Common Mobile Switch (CMobs) and Common POS Switch (CPOS) went live. In this process, I believe we have also addressed our national value creation objective of supporting financial inclusivity in the country, by helping to link distant and even remote communities to the conveniences?
and cost benefits of high-quality electronic financial transactions.?

Speaking of the controversy surrounding their vehicle purchases in social media with pictures, Deputy Minister of Home Affairs Nimal Lansa said he had purchased his vehicle, a Toyota V8, at a cost of Rs. 8.5 million.
?I did not purchase it through the ministry but through a private car dealer. I used the duty free permit that was provided to me as a parliamentarian to purchase this vehicle,? he said.
The Deputy Minister went on to say that he was not the only one who purchased the particular type f vehicle. ?Eight others purchased it with me and there are 16 more that will come into the country,? he said.
Meanwhile, Minister of Foreign Employment Thalatha Athukorala too confirmed that she too had purchased her vehicle, a Toyota Sahara, with her personal funds and not through her ministry.
?I used the permit to buy the vehicle. Some parliamentarians didn?t use their permits as they were waiting for the vehicle prices to increase, so they could bring it down and sell it. I have never done that nor will I ever do so,? she said.
The vehicles in her possession were purchased when her brother was a parliamentarian and when she was elected to parliament. ?I did not sell any of the vehicles with my permits in 2004 and 2010. I will not do so,? she said.

Singer Finance launches Visa credit card

?
By Zahara Zuhair
Singer Sri Lanka embarked on a historic venture recently by introducing a credit card through Singer Finance with Visa International. It can be used at merchants who accept credit cards across the country and withdraw cash from ATMs connected to the Visa network.
Singer Finance CEO Shantha Wijeweera said that Singer Finance is the first finance company to issue a credit card approved by the Central Bank.
?We launched the credit card at the correct time and it will be issued free of charge and the target market will be not only the city-based customers but also traditional customers,? he said.?
Singer Group Chief Executive Officer Asoka Pieris said that it was very logical for Singer to enter the credit card business as apart from major banks, Singer has the highest number of customers being provided with financing at any time.
?In terms of the number of customers we are huge, more than many finance companies, only behind few banks in Sri Lanka. In the years to come, consumer finance business will be move into credit cards, so that is the reason why Singer is into this business,? he imparted.
Though some question why they needed to enter into the credit card market, as it is a cluttered business, where many credit card companies compete among the limited number of credit card consumers, he explained that when looking at the number of credit cards available, which is 500,000, and out of the working people 8.5 million do not have credit cards and their vision is to fill that market providing the consumers with credit cards.
He said that Singer has one of the lowest non-performing loan ratios in the island, which is an invaluable asset in the credit card industry.?
Taking through the history, he said that when they started operations way back in 1877 in Sri Lanka they started the concept of higher purchasing, having introduced it to the world in 1851.
?In 2004, Singer set up Singer Finance and with that entered business with leasing and higher purchase of vehicles. Then moved on to other consumer products such as loans and then business-to-business (B2B) transactions, invoice discounting,? he said.
Singer Head of Credit Cards Thilan Rupasinghe said that they are the first non-banking institution to issue a credit card in Sri Lanka.
He said in Sri Lanka credit card penetration is only 10 percent and the mass market is yet to be capitalised.?
When it comes to security of the credit cards he said that it is equipped with?
chip-based technology, which would avoid card skimming.
Singer Finance (Lanka) being their first partner in Sri Lanka, Worldline South Asia and Middle East CEO Deepak Chandnani said that they would be responsible for card issuance and management.?
?The Sri Lankan market has a strong base of over 16.3 million debit and credit cards. With transactions growing at around 27 percent we see a great potential in this country,? he said.?
