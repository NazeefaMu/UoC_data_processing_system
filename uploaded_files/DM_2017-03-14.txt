Arrest of Indian fishermen will continue: Minister
	
The Government would not stop arresting Indian fishermen and trawlers if they crossed the International Maritime Boundary Line and engaged in fishing in Sri Lankan waters, Fisheries Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said today.
He said any Indian fishermen would be arrested if found fishing in the Sri Lankan waters and all captured trawlers would be confiscated.
About 5,000 Indian trawlers enter in to our waters and take our resources forcibly, destroying our maritime resources, he noted.
The issue has been there for the last 30 years but no previous Government could find a sustainable solution.
But as the present Fisheries Minister, I have given the orders to arrest the fishermen who trespassed into the Sri Lankan waters. Trawlers and other fishing gear confiscated before 2015 were released.
But the same Indian fishermen came back in to Sri Lankan waters for fishing after getting their trawlers back, the Minister said.
He said the seized trawlers would not be released anymore and there were about 128 trawlers under Sri Lankan custody.
Indian fishermen used to do illegal fishing thrice a week in our waters. Most of them come with steel boats and they would crash in to our boats leaving behind heavy damages to our fishermen.
However the Indian Government has accepted the complaints made by us saying the Indian fishermen were used to do illegal fishing methods such as bottom trawling, which destroys maritime eco system.
He said that another round of discussions would be held in Sri Lanka in April to discuss the issues, he said.
I will get involved to find better solutions, while developing the good-will between the countries.
By now, the Indian Government had informed the Ministry that they had taken fir solutions over the issues, he said.
About 92 bottom trawling Sri Lankan fishermen had been sent to international waters for deep sea fishing. Also, steps have been taken to give more openings in various fishery-related fields for employment among the fishing communities, he said.
However, Minister Amaraweera said Indian Government had informed him that the Indian Government had barred issuing licences for bottom trawling for Indian Fishermen. (Chaturanga Pradeep)

British MPs approve bill to begin Brexit
	
British MPs today overwhelmingly approved a bill allowing Prime Minister Theresa May to trigger negotiations for the UK's exit from the European Union.
The House of Commons rejected amendments by the House of Lords, calling on the government to protect the status of EU nationals within three months of the start of Brexit talks, by 335 votes to 287. They also dismissed calls for Parliament to have a meaningful vote on any Brexit deal by 331 to 286 votes.
This means the EU (Notification of Withdrawal) Bill passed the House of Commons without any changes and would now go back to the Lords, where it is expected to be passed.
Both Houses of Parliament have to agree the text of the bill before it can be sent for Royal Assent from Queen Elizabeth II and become law.
May could then theoretically trigger Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty any time this week, but indications are that she is unlikely to trigger the negotiations until the end of this month.
It was widely believed that the MPs would overturn the two amendments to the bill suggested by the Lords - one that calls for a guarantee of the rights of EU citizens in the UK and the second which ensures Parliament has a vote on any final deal with the EU.
Opposition Labour party had urged May to consider keeping the "really important" Lords amendments.
"The issue of the rights of EU nationals to remain here is a decent human one and part of our economic success or not," said Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn.
Britain's Brexit Secretary David Davis had called on Parliament over the weekend to not block the Bill any longer or "tie the prime minister's hands" over Parliament getting a final vote on the deal and on EU citizens' rights in the UK.
Ahead of the Commons vote, the heads of 35 Oxford University colleges had pleaded with MPs to allow European Union citizens the right to stay after Brexit.
In a letter to The Times, signed by Louise Richardson, the Oxford vice-chancellor, and the heads of all but three of the colleges, the academics dismiss as insufficient the indications by ministers that European citizens already resident in Britain were likely to be allowed to stay.
May has committed to triggering Article 50 by the end of March. (Economic Times)

Cabraal justifies bond sales during his tenure
	
Former Central Bank Governor Ajith Nivard Cabraal rejected allegations about irregularities in the sale of bonds during his time, and said the bond sales were carried out at that time with the sole objective of minimising the cost of government borrowings.
In a statement, he said the Central Bank had already confirmed on March 2, 2017, that all Treasury bond sales had been done in accordance with the applicable rules, regulations and laws via a transparent procedure.
My assertion as well as that of the Central Bank are clearly borne out by the clean and unqualified reports of the Auditor General (AG) over the years, and in particular, the AGs report dated 16th January 2017, which could be accessed from the AGs website.
According to official economic data published after 2015, the previous administration transformed the 2005 US$ 24 billion Sri Lankan economy to a US$ 80 billion economy by 2014, while enhancing the GDP per capita from US$ 1,242 to US$ 3,853. Economic growth for the 6 years, 2009 to 2014, averaged an unprecedented 6.5% per annum. Inflation was controlled at mid-single digits for 6 years from 2008 to 2014. The debt situation as indicated by the Debt to GDP ratio which was dangerously high at 91% in 2005, was skilfully managed and reduced to 70% by 2014, even while a massive infrastructure development programme was implemented. Foreign reserves increased from US$ 2,735 million at end 2005, to US$ 8,208 million by end 2014. The Balance of Payments (BOP) recorded a massive surplus of US$ 1,369 million in 2014. From 2006 to 2014, the Rupee was maintained at stable levels, with the average depreciation of the Rupee during this period being the lowest-ever since the liberalization of the economy in 1977. By end 2014, interest rates of all Government Securities from 3 months to 30 years had stabilized between 5.5% and 9.5%. The countrys credit rating and economic outlook had improved significantly, and foreign investors invested confidently in Sri Lankan stocks and government securities. Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) recorded significant growth and reached USD 1,616 million in 2014, its highest-ever in history. Overall, the economy progressed smoothly through the severe global economic, financial, oil and food crises, as well as across the major terrorist conflict and a possible bank failure. As a consequence, external and internal shocks did not penetrate into the economy, and people did not suffer any adverse effects of these mega challenges.
In stark contrast, under the current administration, economic growth has been woefully weak, and inflation has started to rise. The debt to GDP ratio has escalated sharply to 76% by end 2015, and is likely to exceed 82% at the end of 2016, according to analysts. Infrastructure development has been minimal. Foreign reserves have plummeted to USD 5,453 million by end January 2017. The Rupee is depreciating rapidly, while the 2015 BOP deficit of US$ 1,489 million was the worst-ever in the countrys history. Interest rates have almost doubled in the last 2 years, adding a massive burden to the government finances. Foreign investors have pulled out more than USD 2.5 billion from government securities, with the stampede to exit continuing. The countrys credit rating and outlook has been downgraded. FDI has crashed to around USD 400 million in 2016. The stock market is in a serious slide, and hundreds of billions of rupees has been wiped out from the market capitalisation. In the meantime, unbearable fiscal and other burdens are heaped on the people, the private sector and the economy almost daily, even while the economy is being rocked with mega scams, scandals and losses, he said.

A half-day workshop on Integrated Reporting  Practical Aspects was conducted by the Institute of Certified Management Accountants of Sri Lanka (CMA) recently at Taj Samudra.
The objective of this workshop was to build integrated reporting capacity of companies and help accountants and other individuals to acquire and strengthen skills that will support them as they adopt integrated reporting.
This will enable companies preparing integrated reports (IR) to achieve excellence, improve their reports and enter the CMA Excellence in IR Awards 2017, which will be held in July this year. The ten best integrated reports will receive awards together with the overall winner and runner-up. A special award will also be made for the most concise report and the small and medium category. A sector award will be given for the banks and financial sector and for industry and commerce.
The International Reporting Council (IIRC) has set up the IR training programme in 2015, which celebrated its first anniversary and this programme was conducted to coincide with the completion of the first anniversary. The training programme was conducted based on the guidelines of IR training on the learning outcomes approach from the IR Competence Matrix, which includes the knowledge, skills and behaviours organisations need to adopt integrated reporting and realize its benefits.
The workshop was inaugurated by CMA President Prof. Lakshman R. Watawala, who explained the importance of companies adopting the IIRC framework in the preparation of IRs. He also stated that Sri Lankan companies are far ahead of their regional counterparts and around 40 companies had entered the CMA Excellence in Integrated Reports Awards competition last year. He was also thankful to IIRC for supporting the institute in this event and the conduct of training programmes.
The keynote address on Understanding IR was delivered by Diesel & Motor Engineering PLC (DIMO) Chief Financial Officer Suresh Gooneratne, who shared his experiences on integrated reporting. DIMO is one of the pioneers and an active participant of the IR Business Network which helps companies on all stages of the journey towards integrated reporting.
Recently DIMO won the award for the Best Integrated Report in South Asia conducted by the South Asian Federation of Accountants. It was also the winner of the CMA Excellence in Integrated Reporting Awards in 2015 and 2016. He spoke on the practical aspects and the importance of the six capitals and how they should be presented in the integrated report.
At the outset of the panel discussion moderator Management Systems (Pvt.) Limited and Integrated Reporting Council of Sri Lanka Board of Management Chairman Asite Talwatte shared his experience on Awareness of the Integrated Reporting Practical Aspects. This was followed by a lively discussion with the panel of experts on IR. The following matters were discussed by the panellists. Importance of stakeholder relationships, materiality, consistency and reliability, strategic focus and future orientation, governance, value creation process and the capitals financial, manufacturing, intellectual, human, social and natural were discussed.
Institute of Cost Accountants of India Vice President Sanjay Gupta stated that the Security Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has issued a circular on February 7, 2017 advising top 500 listed companies, which are required to prepare Business Responsibility Report (BRR) to adopt IR on a voluntary basis for the financial year 2017-2018.
CMA President Prof. Lakshman R. Watawala stated that a recommendation will be sent to the Securities and Exchange Commission of Sri Lanka to consider adoption of IR for all quoted companies.  
This workshop gave an opportunity to participants to obtain clarifications the preparation of an IR.

Dutch police blast protesters with water cannons
	

Turkish ministers have been forced out of Holland sparking mass riots on the streets of Rotterdam as protesters and police became embroiled in violent clashes. Many of those protesting were Turkish nationals living in the Netherlands. Water cannon were fired at demonstrators in an attempt to control the crowds who were seen to be kicking police officers on the ground as well as throwing stones and metal railings. 
The ugly scenes were in reaction to two Turkish ministers being blocked from entering the country by officials, which prompted Tayyip Erdogan to label the Dutch Nazi remnants and fascists. 
Thousands of demonstrators gathered outside the Turkish consulate in Rotterdam demanding action after the Turkish foreign minister Mevlut Cavusoglu was denied entry into the country. 
Turkeys families minister, Fatma Betul Sayan Kaya, was also blocked by Dutch police from entering the consulate and escorted to the town of Nijmegen, near German border. 
Both have since been escorted out of Holland.

There is a madam holding a high office at national level. According to official records, the lady attends office in her official car from a distant place in the South, a distance of 225 kilometres back and forth.

She has claimed a fuel allowance of Rs. 517,583 for the last year. She has received Rs.54,450 by way of reimbursement of the total she claimed to have paid for using the Southern Expressway during the year. She has claimed a total of Rs.271,752 as holiday pay for the year. This means the Ministry has incurred an expenditure of Rs. 843,785 on her account during the year in addition to paying her a big salary.

Govt. has over 300 mega projects  Vajira Abeywardane
	
	But, no signboard advertising on them
	
	
	Establishment Code needs reforms
	
	
	Democracy flourishes in full steam
	
Home Affairs Minister Vajira Abeywardane, in an interview with the Daily Mirror, says that the Government has undertaken over 300 major development projects. He says democracy flourishes today in the country. Excerpts: 
The National Unity Government will complete its second anniversary this year. How do you look at its performance
Most of the people are not used to this novel experience in politics. With the past experiences, they believe in reverting to the old system. Be that as it may, all are set in place for a new journey in the greater interests of the country. 
What is the way forward in the context of the two parties taking on each other while being in a Unity Government
This is a situation where people enjoy democratic freedom in great abundance. There are different voices being raised with no bar. It is visible. It is a phenomenon visible only when democracy flourishes. One should not get panicked over it. 
In democracy, freedom is meant for constructive criticism, making way for a better outcome for the country at the end. Today, we see a kind of stalemate in Governmental affairs. How do you see it
There is no stoppage of Governmental activities as such. As of now, we have started work on 300 new development projects. If you reserve one whole page in the newspaper, we can outline all of them. These are mega projects. At grassroots level, we completed projects worth Rs. 1 million each in all the Grama Niladhari Divisions. We, in fact, carried it out in 2015 and 2016. It means Rs. 2 million has been pumped into each division. There are 14,000 such divisions. However, there are no name boards erected at every junction bearing the images of the President and the Prime Minister. So, people think nothing is happening. With the passage of time, the truth will dawn on people. 
What are the main projects which you can highlight
One is the Dedduwa Economic Zone in my constituency. It is a project covering an area of 400-500 acres. The identified blocks of land are being acquired after payment of compensation. In Akurala of the Galle District, survey work has commenced for the acquisition of 500 acres of land. As for the Galle Port, it is to be developed with investment from Japan and Sri Lanka alike for the promotion of tourism. 


"There is no stoppage of Governmental activities as such. As of now, we have started work on 300 new development projects. If you reserve one whole page in the newspaper, we can outline all of them"

In the Koggala Free Trade Zone, a land extent of 12 acres is still left unused. We made use of it to put up manufacturing plants. Here, 10,000 persons will get new employment. These are projects only in the Galle District. Next, we continue with the expressway and railway projects by the previous Government. The expressway and the railway line will be extended up to Hambantota.
As for the Hambantota port project, it is embroiled in some problems. How do you plan to proceed with it
There is no need to get alarmed about it. In 2011, 2013 and 2014, the previous Government submitted proposals inviting Foreign Direct Investment. In 2016, we, the new Government, invited foreign investors. Accordingly, investors have agreed to come. For the project proposals submitted in 2011, 2013 and 2014, no one responded. There was a different situation in 2016. A huge investment is proposed. But, adequate human resources cannot be found from the locality. We have to improve the human resources. We are acting in that direction. 
There are amendments proposed to the original agreement to develop the Hambantota Port. How do you proceed
Again, there is no need to be alarmed. There are agreements worked out in 2011, 2013 and 2014 by the former Government. We have another agreement in 2016. We have worked it out to attract the highest possible number of investors. 
How feasible is it for us to attract FID competing with countries such as Bangladesh, Vietnam and Malaysia which have comparative advantages over us
Of course, the main issue is the lack of human resources. In the construction industry, for example, we do not find adequate workers. In other sectors, we have a shortage of workers in the skill-oriented sectors. 
Therefore, the Prime Minister has decided to make school education mandatory even after Grade 10 up to Grade 13. That is to direct school children to relevant vocational study fields at their schools. We need a programme to train them with technological skills. Then, we can not only create one million job opportunities but also offer jobs to those outside the country. In the construction industry, we run short of labourers, fitters, plumbers, carpenters and all. We do not have enough mechanics and electricians. We take five years for the construction of a building which otherwise can be built in two years. We face this problem due to lack of skilled workers. 
How do you proceed with the Public Private Partnership Model proposed for revamping the State institutions
There is nothing to fear about it. We develop the country with cash infusion from the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank, JICA and other financial agencies in the world. Likewise, development is done with the help of individuals with adequate capital for investment. It is important to attract such persons with investment capacities to Sri Lanka. In Sri Lanka, we have only 20 million people. However, there are millions of Sri Lankans, either with dual citizenship or not, living in different parts of the world. Some of them are among the wealthiest in the countries they live in. The duty of the government is to attract them here. 
Earlier, you have planned for a new Bill called Gram Raj Bill to deal with local administration. How far have you progressed now
The Home Affairs Ministry, under its purview, has 25 District Secretariats, 332 Divisional Secretariats, 14022 Grama Niladhari Divisions, 17,800 Development Officers and the Registration Department. We have the administrative machinery that is needed to oversee the development work cutting across the country. The Gram Raj concept is a new addition. The Prime Minister has submitted two Cabinet Papers in this regard. 
Besides, another Cabinet Paper has been submitted by the Prime Minister for the establishment of a Public Services Management Authority in line with the standards and practices in the developed world. Anyone aggrieved by the public service can complain to it. 
How far have you progressed in relation to this institution
Of course, we have worked out basic plans. We have received all shades of opinions in this regard. The Prime Minister has submitted the Cabinet Paper. The draft legislation will be presented to Parliament soon. 
As for legislation on the Gram Raj you mentioned, will it clash with the powers of the local authorities
It will not clash with the powers of the local bodies. We can, in fact, carry out the intended work without introducing fresh legislation. This is aimed at ensuring the participation of rural people in development. That is to rejuvenate villages in keeping with the aspirations of the people. 
How similar is to the old Gam Sabha systems
We cannot go back to that system. From then and now, the situation has changed much in terms of geographic location, population sizes and all. 
Yet, there is a lot to be learnt from the basic concept of Gam Sabha. What are your views
We can extract some of its positive features. We cannot resurrect the past. We have to move forward. 
What is the Governments plan for the expansion of the public service
We are acting for the expansion of it. It is the Government service that works out the legal background and guidelines even for the private sector to progress. When the country develops, all sectors get developed. When the Free Trade Zone concept was introduced, the Government sector gave leadership to it. Along with the private sector development, the public service also gets expanded. 
What about new recruitment
We are recruiting without any problem to the Essential Services of the Government sector. We are planning to recruit 2000 Grama Niladharis. 
There is a perception that Government officials have been demotivated for work due to fear of being victimised by the Financial Crimes Investigation Division (FCID)
It is an outdated perception. I do not see that it is noteworthy now. The Constitution has stipulated how the Public Service should be governed. It happens accordingly. 
In the Establishment Code, it has been stipulated. When a particular situation cannot be dealt with by the Ministry Secretary concerned, it can be referred under other laws applicable. When there is criminal liability arising, action can be taken in terms of the laws concerned by the Government. Our government also sticks to the due procedure laid down in the Constitution. 
Are you planning to reform the current laws in this regard
Actually, a lot of reforms are needed. It is true that a lot of changes are needed in the Establishment Code. That is due to be done in the future. There are views expressed. 
How is the United National Party (UNP) getting ready for future elections
We are ready for elections at any moment. In 2002, we won the election at the local authorities including Attanagalle. We are now taking steps in this direction again. When the election is conducted at the appropriate time, the present administration will win all. 
What are the reforms proposed in the UNP
A party is always subjected to reforms. The UNP forges ahead with reforms all the time. We intend to work for the victory at next elections after doing timely reforms to the party. 
Can you tell anything definite about it
There is nothing definite in politics. It is always open-ended. 

"There was a different situation in 2016. A huge investment is proposed. But, adequate human resources cannot be found from the locality. We have to improve the human resources. We are acting in that direction"

Govt. unable to benefit from fundamental changes in the U.S.   G.L.
	
Talking about the UNHRC process and its implications on Sri Lanka, former External Affairs Minister Prof. G. L. Peiris in an interview said the government had committed to implement the provisions of the resolution, and that it had placed the country in a serious situation. The interview:
How do you compare and contrast the processes undertaken at the UNHRC during your time and the current rule
There is a huge disparity between the policy adopted under the Mahinda Rajapaksa government and the current policy line. The gist of the present governments policy is that they ask for time. It means they concede. The UNHRC resolution adopted on October 1, 2015 is based on the Darusman report. The report, based on evidence from anonymous sources, concluded that there were reasonable grounds to believe that the armed forces were responsible for mass-scale killing of civilians, disappearances, rape, deliberate starvation of people in the North and so forth. The resolution on Sri Lanka was based on that. The current governments stance is that there is evidence of war crimes. While accepting it, the government says it will take stringent initiatives to ensure that such practices do not continue. We regard this as a sellout of the armed forces. Our position was entirely different.
There was no asking for time. Our position was explicit and categorical that the armed forces were not guilty of any war crimes at all. The context is important. During the final stages of the war, there were 350,000 civilians trapped in a narrow strip of land. They were held hostage by the LTTE. In those circumstances, the armed forces have not only the right but also the duty to intervene militarily to protect the lives of civilians. Therefore, in keeping with the principles of international law and international humanitarian law, it can be clearly shown that the armed forces were not guilty of war crimes. At that time, a great deal of work was done with the technical assistance of world renowned experts like Desmond de Silva. Our position was that we could establish that there was no liability at all. We are prepared to buttress that position by unassailable legal content. Thus, it is a very far cry from the present government.
Now, the government says there will be no participation of foreign judges in hearing accountability cases. What are your views
The next point is about foreign judges where the governments position is bizarre. In the resolution of October 1, 2015, the operative paragraph 6 states categorically that the government of Sri Lanka agrees to commonwealth and other foreign judges, prosecutors and investigators and even defence counsels. That is a categorical promise given by the international community, and is incorporated in the resolution. President Sirisena says he is not for foreign judges. Very recently, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe was echoing that point. This raises an interesting question; who placed Sri Lanka in this perch Whatever may be said locally, there is now a formal commitment at the international level from which we cannot extricate ourselves. That has paved the way to a lot of developments which are inimical to the armed forces, the police and the political leadership of the country. The report of Sri Lanka states that the progress is worryingly sluggish. The demand of the international community is that Sri Lanka must deliver on its own commitments. These are not promises extracted or conditions imposed by outsiders, but pledges voluntarily and deliberately given by the Sri Lankan Government.
Our position that there should not be international intervention was heavily supported by a large segment of the international community. Asian countries that are members of the UNHRC, a majority of African countries, the Arab world, Russia and China are among them. Today, they are silent. Today, Sri Lanka is in a very serious situation.
There are fundamental political changes in the United States. How will it impact Sri Lanka
The government is not in a position to benefit from the fundamental changes in the U.S. because of this policy. Recently, there was an important event that took place in Washington - the launch of their global Human Rights Report. For the first time in ten years, the U.S. Secretary of States, appointed by President Donald Trump, was absent. The other significant development was the cancellation of a high-profile media conference scheduled to take place with the event. It had been held during previous times. All these factors reflect the clearly-articulated position of President Trump that there will not be intervention in the affairs of other countries. The U.S. does not propose to play the role of policeman. It will handle its own problems. Had the Sri Lankan government not committed to these provisions of the resolution, we could have reaped the harvest of this situation. That is especially in a context where key figures of the Obama administration who were responsible for the policy against Sri Lanka have all lost their positions. Nisha Biswal, the then Assistant Secretary of State, visited our country almost every three months. Samantha Power, the then US Ambassador to the UN, was the principal architect of this policy. All these individuals have been removed by President Trump. It is a sea change. But, we are totally unable to benefit from it because of the present governments policy.
What is your view on the Constitution-making process
On the Constitutional reforms, one thing is very clear; There is no genuine initiative with regard to Constitutional reforms. There is political posturing largely with a view to placating those elements that played a critical role in bringing about a regime change. It is a political exercise and not a serious Constitutional exercise. This is clear in his address to the UNHRC. The Foreign Minister stated that Sri Lanka was deeply committed to the Constitutional exercise, and in his words, the parliamentary process as well as referendum are critical for the government. On the same day in Colombo, Minister Chandima Weerakkody made a statement that there would not be any referendum. Both he and Minister Mahinda Amaraweera categorically articulated this position. President Sirisena, in his manifesto, has said he would undertake only those reforms which were legally possible without a referendum. They said President Sirisena was not committed to an entirely new Constitution replacing the existing one.


"The report of Sri Lanka states that the progress is worryingly sluggish. The demand of the international community is that Sri Lanka must deliver on its own commitments. These are not promises extracted or conditions imposed by outsiders, but pledges voluntarily and deliberately given by the Sri Lankan Government"

There is inconsistency with regard to the position of the president as well. When he was nominated the common candidate, he made three pledges. One was the abolition of the executive presidency which he reiterated when participating in the budget debate and at the funeral of the Ven. Maduluwawe Sobhitha Thera. Then, the leader of the House Lakshman Kiriella said it would be a new Constitution and there would be a referendum. There is total incompatibility of statements, one with the other. And it certainly amounts to a mass of confusion. The resulting position is that even with regard to the essential elements of a new Constitutional structure, there is no consensus within the government whatsoever. Their statements are teeming with internal contradictions. It is clear that this is not a serious exercise.
The government says there is freedom for people to live without any fear. How do you respond
There are formidable positions arising with regard to security. During the previous regime, we banned about 18 organisations. We had evidence that they were linked to the LTTE. We banned a large number of individuals. Of these, the ban has been removed on one half of these organisations by the present government. The ban has been removed on two-thirds of the individuals. This has brought about a certain environment in the Northern Province in particular. Maveer festivities are openly happening in full sight of the armed forces. Posters of Prabhakaran appear in every corner in the North. There is a whole culture favourable to the dissemination of LTTE propaganda. It is taking place with impunity. Parallel to this, another dangerous development is taking place. There are other extremist groups emerging. These groups are attracting people because they say the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) is not delivering. There is a growing current of public opinion. Today, it is reaching a crescendo. Indication is the conspiracy to assassinate an MP. Evidence in the possession of the TID is alarming. There has been material support from the Diaspora in four countries. On the basis of evidence available to the TID, five persons have been arrested and produced before the Kilinochchi court. But, the normal law  the Criminal Procedure Act - has been used, not the provisions of the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA). The PTA is not used against these suspects, but against intelligence officers of the Army. The police have taken these suspects to various locations in Jaffna, Kilinochchi and Trincomalee districts. Claymore mines and ammunition have been discovered. The lawyers appearing for these suspects have tried to stifle these investigations. The police have been hampered by the fact that powers that would have been available under the PTA are not at their disposal because it is not used. We feel the setting up of a conducive environment for terrorists to raise their heads again.
In our time, we realised that a movement like this cannot be destroyed because of a military defeat. We were vigilant to detect the slightest sign of resurgence and to deal with it.
How do you support your argument that there was evidence of the LTTE raising its head
A good example was in the months of March and December in 2012. There was evidence of regrouping on the part of these people. At that time, the government acted swiftly. It collected evidences and sent to Tamil Nadu. The Q Branch in Tamil Nadu Politics swooped down one house in the suburbs of Chennai. People were arrested, charged and convicted. What we have today is a very different situation. Today, the government cannot deal with the situation because of the commitment made to those who helped in the regime change.


"There is total incompatibility of statements, one with the other. And it certainly amounts to a mass of confusion. The resulting position is that even with regard to the essential elements of a new Constitutional structure, there is no consensus within the government whatsoever. Their statements are teeming with internal contradictions. It is clear that this is not a serious exercise."

The other matter relates to Parliament which is becoming more and more turbulent. There is gross distortion there. There are 53 MPs who represent the genuine opposition. To call opposition Leader R. Sampanthan is a fundamental misnomer. The opposition leader, by definition, is the leader of the government in waiting. In India, there is the principle that one party must enjoy at least ten per cent of seats to be the main opposition. There was much fanfare and pageantry with regard to the enactment of the 19th Amendment to the Constitution.
In a recent interview with the Daily mirror, former Indian Foreign Secretary Shivshankar Menon spoke about the planned Western influence during the final stages of the war. As the then External Affairs Minister, what is the reason for the West to become hostile to Sri Lanka
There was a strong feeling on the part of those countries that we were not listening to them. If we allowed them to have it their way, what would have been the situation today
What do you mean by their way
For example, that is to take Prabhakaran away from Sri Lanka. That was indicated to us. Then, it was to have ceasefire. David Miliband and Bernard Kouchner, the British and French Foreign Secretaries came here. We decisively rejected those overtures. If there were a ceasefire, the LTTE would have used that opportunity to regroup as they did on numerous occasions in the past. Then, the war would have still been going on. Had Prabhakaran been taken out of the country and given asylum, the LTTE would never have been vanquished. There was an element of duplicity in that attitude. For instance, there was an allegation that adequate quantities of food and medicine were not sent. At that time, the whole operation was supervised by a committee comprising representatives of these countries. The Ambassadors of the European Union, Japan and the US were there. They knew that more than enough food and medicine were sent. Then, the evidence of Neil Buhne, the UN resident Coordinator in Sri Lanka at that time, is on record that what was done was more than enough.
One time, you were the Chief Negotiator of peace talks with the LTTE. What is your experience on the attitude of the LTTE
At that time, every effort was made to resolve this problem politically - to arrive at a negotiated settlement. But, the LTTE, at every point, played for time. They did not commit to any distinct position. The fact that genuine attempts were made at that time stood us in good stead during the time of hostilities. It is well-known that the LTTE was defeated military using technical information placed at our disposal by foreign powers. For example, the destruction of several ships carrying arms  one was off the coast of Indonesia - is there. We used information made available to us. This would not have happened had the international community been dissatisfied with the genuine attempts made.
What are the examples to prove the intransigence of the LTTE
They never submitted proper proposals to us, but proposals were submitted by us. They never said what their bottom line was. That was the recurring attitude of the LTTE during peace talks.

"The current governments stance is that there is evidence of war crimes. While accepting it, the government says it will take stringent initiatives to ensure that such practices do not continue. We regard this as a sellout of the armed forces. Our position was entirely different. There was no asking for time. Our position was explicit and categorical that the armed forces were not guilty of any war crimes at all."

Govt. won't rush into political reforms: PM
	
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe yesterday said that he and President Maithripala Sirisena will have to go slow when bringing about political reforms and should achieve it through an ongoing dialogue.
The Prime Minister made this remark at a programme held to mark the centenary of the Russian revolution in Colombo last evening.
The late Prime Minister D S Senanayake once said lets go slow when the socialist leaders of this country wanted to go on a fast track in bringing political reforms after independence. Likewise we too have to go slow on time and go on a fast track whenever it is needed. The dialogue among all political parties has to continue or else there would be dictatorship in the future, he said.
Sri Lanka too created a revolution like Russia. First one was in November 2014 where we fielded Maithripala Sirisena as our Presidential candidate. The second revolution was where the two main political parties got together. These two revolutions have to be taken forward. We will follow the USSR when doing it, he added.
The Prime Minister was responding to Political Scientist and Constitution Export Professor Jayadeva Uyangoda who said in his key note address at the event that the process of political reforms is going off the track and the two leaders should share the responsibility of implementing reforms and also the credit after doing so. He also stated that people should be given the opportunity to decide on reforms in the form of a referendum if the constitution assembly cannot do it.
Commenting on the October Revolution in Russia in 1917 he stated that one has to accept that the Russian Revolution changed the world. The Communist Party in USSR could not change and socialism fell but China changed and socialism still prevails there. The important factor here is changing with the time and circumstance, the Prime Minister further said. (Yohan Perera)

He knew the worth of personal touch
	

A local politico eyeing a chief purohitas post had reportedly accompanied a high political authority on an official foreign visit at his own expense.

The politico had purchased his air tickets and personally borne all other expenses in his bid to be in the company of the high political authority during the latters sojourn abroad. Our countrys envoy in the host country is said to be an in- law of this local politico and he had facilitated this arrangement.
The local politico had later confided to his buddies that the foreign trip he made was worth the money spent on it as it provided him with ample opportunity to be very close to the big man during the visit, a chance he could not dream of while being here.

HSBC to bring customers closer to age-old Avurudu traditions
	
Bringing a new world to love the old traditions is no easy journey. This year, HSBC plans to bring customers closer to their traditional roots with an Avurudu campaign that is purely centred on long-lived traditions that have passed on through generations.
HSBC notes that traditions associated with the Sinhala and Tamil New Year are manifold, colourful and meaningful. Thus, the campaign hopes to not just bring customers amazing savings on everything they could want to celebrate this auspicious time but also to reconnect them to the many traditions that are followed during the Sinhala and Tamil New Year.
Wearing new clothes with prescribed colours is a marked aspect of the New Year celebrations. HSBC customers will be able to dress up in style to celebrate the season with special savings across a wide range of clothing stores that offer great savings.
The exchanging of gifts is another tradition that is made easy. The bank has partnered with over 190 popular merchants in the country to offer savings of up to 50 percent on a range of categories such as retail and fashion, jewellery and wrist watches, salons, spas and gyms, dining, household, supermarket, insurance and others.
HSBC Sri Lanka Head of Marketing and Communications Tharanga Gunasekera said, We have been in Sri Lanka for 125 years and we have seen different traditions and customs around Avurudu through the years. Given that the new world we live in is fast paced, age-old traditions have become fragmented and we believe this is a good time to remind customers of those traditions. It is also another way to connect with our customers through the New Year season that is widely celebrated by most of our customers in the country.
Moreover, with April being the perfect holiday season, HSBC customers who dont celebrate Avurudu but look to spend cheerful family vacations, can do so at a range of local hotels. They can join in the celebrations by participating in fun Avurudu activities and age-old traditions such as beating the raban (drums), among other associated traditions.

Hundreds of Hindus celebrate the springtime festival of Holi
	

An industrial state was transformed into a sea of colour on Sunday as hundreds of Hindus came together to celebrate the festival of Holi by hurling powdered paint at each other. Between 600 and 700 people took part in the event, held at the Swindon Hindu Temple and Cultural Centre. 

Holi, also known as the festival of colours, is celebrated over two days by Hindus worldwide to mark the arrival of spring. The powder represents the colour brought in by the season.
 
It is also a reference to the legend of Krishna, whose skin was dark blue. He feared his appearance would mean he wouldnt be accepted by his love Radha and so lightheartedly smeared her face in paint to make her look like him. Hindus now throw powdered paint at each other to mark the love of Krishna and Radha. 
Speaking to the Swindon Advertiser Pradeep Bhardwaj, chairman of Swindon Hindu Temple, said: It brings people together in a spirit of tolerance and equality. 
Everyone has a good time, especially the children, and its wonderful to see so many people here.

What is Holi
The Holi festival in India is one of the worlds most extravagant and colourful celebrations. 
It is celebrated over two days from the day of the full moon in the Hindu month of Falguna. The first day is known as Chhoti Holi or Holika Dahan and the second as Rangwali Holi, Dhuleti, Dhulandi or Dhulivandan. 
In India the festival is marked with a national public holiday and sees revelers pour on to the streets. Holi has a lot of significance and marks the victory of good over evil and the departure of winter. People celebrate by smearing each other with paint, spending time with loved ones and eating rich sweets. 
 The festival is ancient and references to it can be found in Fourth Century poetry. The word Holi is derived from the word hola which means to offer prayers to the gods for good harvest.

Its Govt.s weakness: Gota
	
Former defence secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa yesterday said it was the weakness of the government to keep thrusting itself upon the UNHRC Resolution on Sri Lanka when the US, which co-sponsored the resolution, had detached itself from it.
Mr. Rajapaksa said the government should utilize the opportunities in the international arena especially the change of administration in the US.
With the election of President Donald Trump, officials who were interested in Sri Lanka such as Nisha Biswal and Samantha Power were removed. The US has clearly shown that it is not interested in the resolution but its our government which keeps pushing on it. This is a weakness of our government and the Foreign Ministry, he told an event held at Sri Sambuddhathwa Jayanthi Mandiraya in Colombo to launch a report compiled against the UNHRC resolution on the country.
The report titled In defence of the armed forces-A Factual Appraisal of the OISL Report: Rebuttal to the Allegations Against the Armed Forces was compiled by a team of lawyers headed by Darshan Weerasekara at the invitation of the Federation of the National Organisations headed by Ven. Bengamuwe Nalaka Thera and the sponsorship of the Global Sri Lanka Collective.
Mr. Rajapaksa said the Prime Minister of Britain had recently said they wont take any action against their armed forces personnel. How do countries preach to us on our internal matters Those who committed war crimes had become human rights champions today, he said.
He said there were LTTErs in the Tamil National Alliance and that they should take responsibility for their war crimes.
Meanwhile, Rear Admiral Sarath Weerasekara said he would fly to Geneva on Monday night to submit the compiled report to the ongoing 34th regular session of the Human Rights Council.
We have requested for a slot at the session through a NGO based on a Temple in London and expect to submit the report around March 20, he told the Daily Mirror.
At the event, a public proposal was seconded by the people in order to submit to President Maithripala Sirisena requesting him to reject the UNHRC resolution and to make a request to UN Chief to instruct UNGRC Chief to do away with the resolution on Sri Lanka.
Former Army Commander Daya Ratnayake, Major General Kamal Gunaratne, G. A. Chandrasiri, Rear Admiral Mohan Wijewickrama and Rear Admiral Ananda Peiris also attended the event.

Lakshman (Lakshi) Dias Bandaranayake: Fragrance of his memory will remain undiminished
	
Today the 14th day of March is his birthday. It is fifteen months since he passed away. 
It is my privilege to write about the late Mr. Bandaranayake, however, it is a privilege tinged with sadness, when I reminisce the times I worked with him, enjoyed his hospitality, and also been a recipient of his concern, kindness and generosity. From the time I knew him, until his last days, he was to me an affectionate and a respected Sir. 
I met him for the first time on April 24, 1978 as a young Assistant Legal Draftsman. That was the day, I joined the Legal Draftsmans Department, in the Ministry of Justice situated in Hulftsdorp. Along with me, there were seven others recruited as Assistant Legal Draftsmen. Before commencing work, as of practice, the then Office Assistant Simley Fernando (now deceased) took us around the Department first to meet the Senior Officers, and then the working staff, to familiarize us with the workings of the Department. 
Soon we were taken to Mr. Bandaranayakes room. He was then, the most Senior Deputy Legal Draftsman second in command in order of hierarchy. All of us walked into his office with much trepidation. We were led by the Office Assistant. When we walked in, we saw stacks of files on his table, and he was very attentively working on a file. Before we could be introduced to him, he stood up from his seat and told all of us Come, Come, Sit, Sit. Besides Mr. Bandaranayakes own chair, there were only three other chairs in the room. 



He offered his own chair to one of us. Then he requested his peon to bring more chairs into the room. Simultaneously, he gave another errand to the peon, and that was to bring cups of tea for all of us. The then peon Dharmasena brought the cups of tea, faster than bringing the chairs, perhaps so that we would gulp the tea down and leave the room. Mr. Bandaranayake soon realised what was going on. While we were sipping our tea he walked with us to the long verandah which was outside his room. While standing, he spoke to each one of us individually, and then told all of us, You are fortunate to get into this Department. All of you must work hard and I am sure you will be happy here. One of the recruits with me then, was my dear friend Sriyanganie Fernando (now deceased). While leaving the place she whispered into my ears Hari Honda Mahathayek Neda Mano. Api Hari Lucky  A very good gentleman isnt he Mano We are lucky!. I endorsed her statement. 
Readers, I seek your indulgence for a minute to digress. The lady referred to in the above paragraph, my dear friend Sriyanganie rose to be the Additional Legal Draftsman. Later on in life she was a much sought after draftsman of legal documents by one and all. She was a legislative drafter par excellence. I am saddened by her untimely death. The legal profession and the country is poorer by this great loss. May God Grant her eternal rest. 


"At that very first encounter with him what captured my mind instantly was, Mr. Bandaranayakes humility, simplicity and kindness. In this day and age it is rare to meet a Public Officer of his ilk"

At that very first encounter with him what captured my mind instantly was, Mr. Bandaranayakes humility, simplicity and kindness. In this day and age it is rare to meet a Public Officer of his ilk. 
From the time I joined the Legal Draftsmans Department, until his retirement, I had the privilege of working with him. First as a junior officer to him, then as an Associate Officer when I moved up the ladder as a Senior Assistant Legal Draftsman. Sir, was knowledgeable. Any mistake made in a draft by a junior officer was unobtrusively scrutinized by him and corrected. He never embarrassed a junior officer. It was very comfortable working with him. Sometimes as Legal Officers we had tense moments, when our Bills were taken up in Parliament. He always accompanied the junior when necessary to Parliament and made him or her feel at ease. There had been occasions, he acted for the Legal Draftsman of Sri Lanka. Though he held that position, only for short periods, he adorned that chair with aplomb. Then there came the sad moment for all of us, when he retired from service in 1984. 
After retirement, he was much sought after for his ability and integrity. Immediately after his retirement, he served on the Law Commission in far away Trinidad for a short period. Back home, he was a consultant in legislative drafting for the Sri Lanka Telecommunications Department. 
Mr. Bandaranayake was a scion of an illustrious family. He was affectionately and popularly called Lakshman. He was a Barrister-at-law from Lincolns Inn. Prior to joining the Legal Draftsmans Department, he worked for a period in the Inland Revenue Department and also with the late Mr. S. Ambalavaner, Barrister-at-law and Tax Consultant. Income Tax Law, Intellectual Property Law, and Corporate Law, were all up his street. 


During the last few years, he was more in retirement. He was a great music lover. The Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation English Service was one of his favourite channels. Golden Oldies were songs which he listened to with nostalgia. He enjoyed visiting his estate in Kirindiwela and his face would lighten up when anybody talked of his school, St Thomas College, Mt Lavinia. Living in that vicinity, I am sure he kept up with the activities of his Alma Mater. 
He wished well for others and felt happy about anothers success, a rare trait among many human beings. If ever he read in the newspapers or heard from someone of an achievement or an appointment of one whom he knew, he would immediately telephone that person and convey his good wishes. My late husband and I had been on many occasions recipients of this kind gesture. 
Though he retired in 1984, from the Legal Draftsmans Department, he did not lose touch with his friends and colleagues in the legal profession. More so, he retained his friendship with those of us, who were in the Legal Draftsmans Department. At every Annual get-together the Department had, Sir, was there enjoying the company of all, happily socializing and relishing the food and drink. We enjoyed his birthday parties. On a few occasions, he dropped by, at my residence and delivered Rambuttans from his estate. He would, on and off, give telephone calls to some of us whom he knew closely. That was his kind of way, of keeping in touch, with friends and colleagues. 


"Into each life, whatever the degree of its lustre some rain must fall. To Sir the rainfall came in the form of ill health. It is comforting and consoling to all those who had respect and affection for him to know, that the last years of his life, when he was almost confined to his home, he was cared with love and affection by his caring wife Manthri, and his devoted son Niran, and was also well looked after by a faithful attendant"

He passed away 14 months ago, on January 13, 2016. I am certain after his trial by fire cleansed all human weakness, he is, enjoying a plentitude of happiness in a world of love and peace. 
My late husband and I, both had great respect and much affection for him. 
His journey on earth came to an end fourteen months ago, ours may continue for a short while more, but the fragrance of his memory will remain undimmed and undiminished in the hearts and minds of all those who knew him including myself. 
Goodbye Sir! May you rest in peace! 
To live in hearts we leave behind is not to die Thomas Campbell.

Love without a villain Is it hard to stomach
	
FILM REVIEW: Premaya nam (Dirty, yellow, darkness)
Premaya Nam is a quiet, unobtrusive movie with a strong message for our audiences weaned on sugary recipes for romance  love is more complicated and painful than silver screen melodramas would have us believe. This medicine might be too strong for many, as this debut film by brothers Kalpana and Vindana Ariyawansa has not turned out to be a crowd-puller despite it being marketed as a love story, with matching posters. 
It is a ground-breaking film but unobtrusive and without histrionics, and progresses with an almost documentary clarity despite its dubious title in English (Dirty, yellow, darkness). The villain is a pathological condition called OCD (Obsessive-Compulsive-Disorder), not a man with a grudge. There are no song-dance sequences, not even as a fantasy. The abiding fantasy here is mental health, and its elusive. Vishwa, the young advertising executive whos an OCD victim, is desperate to get back his estranged wife. Even his in-laws, initially hostile, are now sympathetic. But he cannot find the inner resources necessary to overcome this disorder, more menacing than any villain with guns or knives. 


Vishwa is ably played by Shyam Fernando, a reputed stage actor known for his complex roles in the plays of Rajitha Dissanayake. His estranged wife is played by Samanalee Fonseka, who in a short time has emerged as a versatile character actress and the first dark-complexioned screen star to emerge after Sandhya Kumari. About half the story unfolds at the Mulleriyawa mental hospital, and the subsidiary roles, such as nurse Inoka, are handled excellently. 
The whole idea of mental ill-health is culturally still a no-go zone in Sri Lanka, the butt of jokes, horror and contempt. In the film, nurse Inoka tells Vishwa that, unless the transfer she has asked for comes through, she may not be able to marry, as her boyfriends parents dont want people to know that their future daughter-in-law works at Angoda (the name of the town associated with this hospital, hence synonymous with madness). 
Madness, mental disturbance, mental disorder  all these are lumped together under the generic term pissu. OCD isnt madness. But, as far as the outside world is concerned, it amounts to the same thing. When Samadhi agrees to marry Vishwa, she knows about his condition. What she doesnt know yet is what its like to live with an OCD sufferer. This story unravels through flashbacks as Vishwas world falls apart. After losing his job, he voluntarily decides to spend time in hospital in a bid to find a cure and save his marriage. 


It is a moving love story, but unlike any other of that genre told in the film medium in Sri Lanka. Whether we take Golu Hadawatha, Parasathu Mal, Hanthane Kathawa or Duhulu Malak at one end, or films like Thushara or Sangeetha at the other, audiences are used to conventional narrative lines of unrequited love, love triangles, or melodramatic plots with villains. All thats fine, but todays audiences inhabit a more complex world; or rather, one where hitherto unacknowledged or hushed up conditions, including mental ill-health and madness, deserve sympathy and treatment rather than confinement, and mental patients too, need love and deserve to be loved. 
The film makers have carefully steered the story away from Angoda jokes. While some of the patients actions produce laughter at the start, they quickly focus on the harsher realities of mental illness and treatment. That there is a love story meshing with this documentary-like narration may have been lost on some, simply because the conventional ploys of a cinematic romance are not there. This is a film which needs a more sophisticated type of film viewer. 


Nor does it help when critics attack for the wrong reasons. One reviewer writing in a Sunday Sinhala newspaper carped about luxury love, visibly annoyed that this isnt a rich-girl poor-boy scenario. While my sympathies are with the down trodden, one should acknowledge that love is one only exalted human emotion that knows no class barriers. Even religious faith comes second to it because people of opposing faiths marry, facing risk of social ostracism and even death. 
We are always happy to know that rich girls dream of, and occasionally even get to marry, socially immobile or downwardly mobile lovers. But there is no need to carp when two upper middle class people who drive shiny new hybrid cars love each other. It takes all that to make the world go around. Neither the rich nor the poor have a monopoly when it comes to love. 
Rohana Weerasinghes musical score, minus soul-searching highs and lows, complements the gentle mood of the film while Jaan Shenbergers cinematography avoids romantic lighting and looks real world, making us aware its the hearts that need to be lit here more than the faces.

Mark Tucker to retire as AIA Group CEO
	
AIA Group Limited yesterday said its Group Chief Executive and President Mark Tucker has informed the board of directors of the company of his intention to retire from his executive positions with the company and its subsidiaries and take up the role of non-executive Group Chairman of HSBC Holdings PLC.
Accordingly, the board announced the appointment of AIA Regional Chief Executive Ng Keng Hooi as the Group Chief Executive and President Designate with immediate effect.
He will succeed Mark as Group Chief Executive and President with effect from September 1, 2017. Hooi has over 37 years of experience in the Asian life insurance industry and is currently AIA Regional Chief Executive responsible for many of the groups largest businesses as well as Group Agency Distribution. He is also a director of various companies within the group including its two largest operating entities, AIA Company Limited and AIA International Limited.
AIA Group Chairman Edmund Tse said, Keng Hooi is a proven leader with an impressive track record and I am delighted that he will succeed Mark as Group Chief Executive and President of AIA. This appointment follows a rigorous and extensive succession process, which included consideration of internal and external candidates.
For the last six and a half years, Keng Hooi has excelled in the role of Regional Chief Executive for AIA displaying first-class leadership and strategic vision while consistently delivering strong results. He is ideally qualified to build on AIAs success to-date.
On behalf of the entire board, I would like to express my sincere thanks to Mark who has made a huge and lasting contribution to AIA as Group Chief Executive and President, having led the company from its IPO in 2010. We are extremely grateful for his leadership and for the outstanding contribution he has made over the last seven years, a period in which all of our financial and operational metrics have improved materially with AIAs value of new business having grown from US $ 667 million in the year ended November 30, 2010 to US $ 2,750 million in the year ended November 30, 2016. I am pleased that we will have the benefit of Marks leadership through an appropriate and orderly period of transition and, of course, we wish him every success possible in his new role as Chairman of HSBC.
Hooi said, AIA is an exceptional company in an advantaged position and the group is in excellent shape. I am delighted to have the opportunity to succeed Mark and continue to work with our outstanding senior management team, our talented colleagues and agents across the organisation and our high-quality business partners to continue our impressive track record of value creation both for our customers and our shareholders. I am looking forward to ensuring a smooth and successful handover period as the entire team at AIA strives to ensure that 2017 is our best year yet.
Mark Tucker said, It has been a great privilege to lead AIA. I am enormously proud of the groups achievements since we became a public company and wish to thank the board for its outstanding support as well as all of our employees and agents whose tremendous insights, dedication, teamwork and relentless pursuit of excellence have been integral to our success and our ability to serve our customers, contribute to our communities and create value for our shareholders.
Having been CEO for seven years and with the company very well positioned to continue its strong growth, I believe now is the right time to make way for a new leader and for me personally to transition to a non-executive career. I have worked closely with Keng Hooi for over 20 years and admire him as an executive with an exceptional track record of strong execution and commercial experience in the Asian region. I have every confidence that AIA will continue to flourish under his outstanding leadership.
While I am sad to be leaving AIA, I am looking forward to new challenges. AIA is an extraordinary business with wonderful people and I am confident that the group will continue to enjoy success in 2017 and well beyond.

mother who had a baby boy after losing both her legs
	
A young woman forced by a lifelong condition to have both her legs removed has amazed doctors by becoming a mother.  Lizzy Georgeson, 26, suffered months of agony throughout her pregnancy to give birth to son Henry.  Doctors had been worried about the extra weight pressure on her prosthetic legs, which did cause her to topple over on a number of occasions. Mrs Georgeson, who became the UKs first double amputee model, after she signed up to a modelling agency, said: Doctors were worried about me carrying so much more weight in front and it did affect my balance and I did have a few falls. 
There was so much pressure on my hips I developed a painful condition which made it difficult to walk and I spent a lot of time in a wheelchair, especially towards the end of my pregnancy. But I would go through it all again to have Henry. Hes an amazing baby and I feel so lucky to be a mum after everything Ive been through. 
Mrs Georgeson and her husband Lewis, who live in Leeds, were thrilled when she discovered she was expecting a baby in February last year. 
Henry was born by caesarean section in October at St Jamess Hospital in Leeds when Mrs Georgeson was 39 weeks pregnant, weighing a healthy 8lb5oz.  Mrs Georgeson was born with club foot - meaning both her feet were back to front. She has suffered a lifetime of chronic pain and endured 36 operations - the first when she was just ten weeks old.

Party organizer is a fraudster
	

An organizer of a main political party in the upcountry is reportedly making lots of money by selling lands using forged title deeds. Most parcels of land he had been selling on forged title deeds had been state-owned properties.

Numerous complaints have been made to authorities against this racketeer whose main accomplice is a personal secretary of a powerful politician, but so far no action has been taken to bring him to book.
This party organizer is said to lost the post he once held following conviction in a court case.
Some people are buying lands from this fraudster without any suspicion because of his standing as an electorate level organizer of a main political party in the country, they say.

SAITM: SLMC challenges CA judgement
	
The Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) yesterday filed an application in the Supreme Court challenging the Court of Appeal ruling that the medical graduates of the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) be provisionally registered.
The Court of Appeal on January 31 ruled that the MBBS graduate of SAITM had a legal right to be provisionally registered by the SLMC on the basis that she had fulfilled the necessary requirements under the Medical Ordinance.
The SLMC has cited SAITM MBBS graduate Dhilmi Kasunda Malshani Suriyarachchi, the SAITM, Minister Lakshman Kiriella, the Ministry Secretary,the UGC and Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne as the respondents
Court of Appeal allowed the writ petition filed by petitioner South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) with cost.
It has observed that under the Medical Ordinance, the Minister was empowered to declare by regulation that any provision of the said Ordinance which enables the holder of that qualification to be registered shall cease to have effect in relation to such institution.
It also observed that that it is clear that under the Ordinance, the SLMC is empowered to appoint a committee and on its recommendation, the SLMC may submit its recommendation to the Minister.
However, the role played by the SLMC ends at that point and any steps with regard to the said recommendations of the SLMC will have to be taken by the Minister under the Provisions of the Ordinance.
It is further observed that the SLMC without any legal basis exceeded the power conferred on it. (S.S. Selvanayagam)

Security Forces in  Sri Lanka Continue to Operate With Impunity - Yasmin Sooka
	
Yasmin Louise Sooka, the Executive Director of the Foundation for Human Rights in South Africa and the International Truth and Justice Project (ITJP) spoke to The Wire about Sri Lankas transitional justice process, the sequencing of judicial mechanisms for the same and the role other countries can play. 
Yasmin Sooka is regarded as a leading human rights lawyer, activist and an international expert in the fields of transitional justice, gender and international war crimes. She previously served on the UN Secretary-Generals Panel of Experts on Sri Lanka. 
	Internationally the approach towards Sri Lanka has shifted 180 degrees
	
	
	This level of militarization is unacceptable eight years after the war
	
	
	Reform is urgently needed for Sinhalese and Muslims as well as Tamils
	
	
	Any transitional justice process, if it is to succeed must be locally owned by victims; not politicians
	
This interview has been edited lightly. 
Could you tell us a little bit about ITJPs work
ITJP documents human rights violations and abuses as well as gathers evidence for the purposes of building a prima facie basis for criminal trials and truth recovery processes. In addition, the ITJP also carries out transitional justice work including the training of CSOs (Civil Society Organisations). The key elements of our documentation and evidence gathering include taking detailed witness statements from survivors of war crimes, torture, arbitrary detention, abductions and sexual violence. Our statements are supported by medico-legal reports. Typically, taking a statement may take between three and four days to complete, with statements running into many pages supported by exhibits like maps, sketches of cells and forensic reports. To date, we have taken 240 statements, which means we have one of the biggest databases of in-depth testimonies attesting to recent Sri Lankan human rights violations and abuses. The evidence gathered constitutes a basis for an independent investigation as in many instances we have identified several alleged perpetrators in the military and police. We hope one day a credible international independent investigative unit with an independent prosecutor will be set up so that the people of Sri Lanka can discover the truth. 
The evidence gathered also provides the basis for a submission to the Truth Commission in Sri Lanka if it is ever established and will expose the violations perpetrated by the security forces. Of course we have pointed out in our recent publication Putting the Wolf to Guard the Sheep all of these depend on witness protection for the witnesses. 
Its been more than two years since Maithripala Sirisena was elected President. How much has changed in Sri Lanka since January 2015
Internationally the approach towards Sri Lanka has shifted 180 degrees. Where once there would have been intolerance and frustration with the Rajapaksas, now there is patience and a willingness to give more time. In terms of the situation inside the country, clearly the atmosphere has eased and activists have more space in which to function, the Human Rights Commission has credible leadership but still lacks capacity and generally civil rights have improved in the south. However in the former conflict areas, Tamil civilians live under a militarised and securitised system in which surveillance and intimidation constitute everyday life. The violations and abuses are ongoing and include abductions, torture and sexual violence which the ITJP unfortunately continues to document once the victims flee the country. This level of militarisation is unacceptable eight years after the war. It also demonstrates that the security forces continue to operate with impunity. 
In terms of fulfilling its transitional justice commitments, how would you describe the governments performance
The Maithripala Sirisena government came to power amidst great hope and goodwill for transformation particularly from Tamil citizens who voted for this government. Shockingly we have witnessed two years of inaction. We have argued that the Sirisena government is complicit in the ongoing violations and abuses because it has done nothing to investigate the very grave allegations of system crimes set out in the (UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights) OHCHR Investigation report (OISL). 
The emphasis has been on procedures, rhetoric and box-ticking but what this government has failed to do is to set out a clear vision of why Sri Lanka needs a transition from the past. The government has also failed to impress upon society in the south that this is necessary if Sri Lanka is to take its place proudly in the international community. The transition is necessary to transform Sri Lanka from a state mired in serious violations and abuses which quite frankly amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity in which its criminal justice institutions have been tarnished. While there is a great deal of glib talk about reconciliation; it is extremely shallow as reconciliation involves a reckoning and an acknowledgement of the truth about the past including past violations. In reality, what we have witnessed is denial from the politicians and many in civil society about the extent of mass atrocities perpetrated by the security forces. What we have is a structural and institutional problem in the country which unless addressed will result in ongoing violations and abuses as we know is happening. Reform is urgently needed for Sinhalese and Muslims as well as Tamils. 


"It is false to portray the demand for criminal accountability as an international demand  this is done by those who want to avoid it because they have something to hide"

In terms of the transitional justice process, we all heralded the national consultation process which took a long time and was perceived as doing the job. When it was farmed out to NGOs we stifled our criticism. It is precisely this farming out of a function, which the government ought to have led, which has allowed the president and prime minister to disown the recommendations, leading many to ask whether the government is serious about the transition. Sadly civil society and many political parties were also duped into believing that the government was sincere in its commitments and now to their cost they are discovering differently. 
Legislation establishing the Office of Missing Persons (OMP) was passed last year. However the chaos and confusion regarding the text in parliament has seen nothing happen. Six months later there is no body established. Best international practice around appointments indicate the need for a transparent vetting process for the selection of persons to run the OMP and any other transitional justice mechanism; rumours abound that the government intends to appoint mainly Sinhalese persons to head a body that will primarily deal with Tamil disappearances. Consideration should be given to appointing Sinhalese, Tamils and Muslims in order to inspire confidence and trust amongst the families of the disappeared. An open nomination and vetting process would ensure that affected communities have the opportunity to nominate people they consider credible particularly those amongst them who have spent a great number of years working on issues of the disappeared. A number of Tamil activists including priests spring to mind as they have risked their lives over years to collect lists of the disappeared. 
How involved should international actors be in Sri Lankas transitional justice process
Any transitional justice process, if it is to succeed, must be locally owned not by the elites and the politicians but by the victims. However decades of violations and abuses as well as disillusionment with the government and its institutions have left many, if not all Tamil victims and witnesses, deeply distrustful. Many have indicated that if they are to testify to a truth commission or court there needs to be meaningful international involvement in that body to win their trust. A credible domestic mechanism is a contradiction in terms. They have all failed; why would things be different now when whats at stake is the investigation of even greater crimes than in the past. This is compounded by the fact that no witness protection exists and whether a witness is in Sri Lanka or abroad there needs to be international involvement in any witness protection programme. 
Theres been some debate surrounding the sequencing of transitional justice mechanisms. What do you think would be the most effective approach
In many countries politicians and elite always try to argue that there should be sequencing not just of the mechanisms but also many argue a peace versus justice option. The issue of sequencing is largely dependent on the context in a particular country. In the Sri Lankan context, one already has the outcome of the OISL inquiry as well as the evidence gathered by groups, including the ITJP, which provides a basis for any criminal accountability mechanism to carry out its work. At the same time, this should not preclude other mechanisms like the truth commission and the OMP from doing their work. This has happened in many countries, including Sierra Leone and Colombia would soon see a plethora of transitional justice mechanisms operating side by side. 
Of course, what has to be worked on is the relationship between these mechanisms to optimise resources and access to information. However, given the different purposes, written into the mandate of the truth commission should be the obligation to name names and pass this onto the criminal justice mechanisms as well as to refer the cases of the missing and the disappeared to the OMP. A lesson that we all learnt from the Sierra Leonean experiences which saw a truth commission operating side by side with the special court is that there should be guidelines on the relationship between these bodies if they are to be successful and achieve their respective mandates. 
Some people have argued that accountability for wartime abuses should be de-prioritised in favour of a political solution to the long-standing ethnic conflict. Relatively, others have asserted that economic justice should be front and centre, and that the call for accountability is actually driven by international actors. Whats your take on all of this
In the Sri Lankan context, a political and economic solution to the conflict is absolutely essential. However, this does not preclude that accountability and addressing entrenched impunity for serious crimes is equally important. The scale and gravity of the crimes perpetrated in 2009 against civilians demands justice. Listening to the traumatised survivors as I did on the UN Panel of Experts as well as the many courageous individuals who stayed behind in the war zone, it is obvious that these are extraordinary crimes for which there must ultimately be accountability. 


"A tough, honest report by the High Commissioner assessing Sri Lankas lack of good faith in implementing Resolution 30/1 with the Council setting clear benchmarks and time frames for the full implementation of all commitments, including essentially the foreign and commonwealth judges, investigators and prosecutors for the court which must be hybrid not domestic"

In my view it represents one of the great tragedies of our time that tens of thousands of civilians were killed in a matter of weeks in a tiny area of the country without the international community intervening  this challenges the entire regime of international humanitarian law and the very notions of decency on which the responsibility of the international community is built. The world cannot let this slip. Nor could the Sri Lankans. In my work in South Africa and Sierra Leone as well as many other parts of the world, political change is important as is economic transformation but bitter experience has taught me that the guarantee of non-recurrence requires measures of accountability  particularly prosecutions of those who were in command responsibility positions. 
Victims also require institutional reform in order to regain trust in the institutions of the state believing that they will work for them irrespective of their religious belief, ethnicity, race and group. In many countries the politicians argue that victims need development rather than reparations and we remind them that every citizen is entitled to development, but the recognition of the wrongdoing suffered by a victim demands acknowledgement and reparations. They need to eat but not at the expense of justice. Both the national consultations as well as the various consultations which were carried out outside of the country have indicated that justice is critical and for victims this means holding the perpetrators criminally accountable. It is false to portray the demand for criminal accountability as an international demand  this is done by those who want to avoid it because they have something to hide. 
The 34th session of the UN Human Rights Council runs from February 27 to March 24 and Sri Lanka is on the agenda. What would you like to see happen
A tough, honest report by the High Commissioner assessing Sri Lankas lack of good faith in implementing Resolution 30/1 with the Council setting clear benchmarks and time frames for the full implementation of all commitments, including essentially the foreign and commonwealth judges, investigators and prosecutors for the court which must be hybrid not domestic. OHCHR has been very clear that a domestic process will not work  we would like to see them impress this point on the international community more forcefully.

Seoul to boost anti N. Korea diplomacy in SL, Singapore
	
South Korean Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se embarked on a three-day trip to Sri Lanka and Singapore on Tuesday to discuss North Korea's threats to regional security, the Korean Foreign Affairs Ministry has said.
According to The Korea Times, the Ministry has said Yun met Singapore Foreign Minister Vivian Balakrishnan first on Tuesday before flying to Colombo for talks with Foreign Minister Mangala Samaraweera on Wednesday.
Yun is expected to make his last-ditch effort as a top South Korean diplomat to urge the international community to step up pressure on North Korea, according to senior foreign ministry officials.
They said rising concerns over North Koreas use of chemical weapons and other weapons of mass destruction will be high on the agenda following the assassination of the North Korean ruler's estranged half-brother Kim Jong-nam in Malaysia, February 13.
"By doing so, South Korea may underscore North Korea's repeated defiance of the international norms and a need to exclude Pyongyang from the United Nations," an official said.
The official speculated that Yun's three-day trip may help bolster South Korea's alliance in the region against North Korea.
Yun is also scheduled to travel to Vietnam from Sunday to Monday after returning to Seoul temporarily for talks with US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson.
Meanwhile, National Security Office chief Kim Kwan-jin is to leave for the United States, Wednesdsay, Cheong Wa Dae said, Tuesday.
Kim will meet U.S. National Security Adviser Herbert Raymond McMaster during his two-day stay there and discuss North Korea's nuclear and ballistic missile threats.
They are likely to reaffirm the two allies' commitment to deploy a U.S. Terminal High Altitude Area Defense battery in South Korea as scheduled regardless of the removal of Park Geun-hye from the presidency, Friday.
Kim and McMaster discussed THAAD deployment and North Korea-related issues over the telephone, March 1.

Sri Lankans among crew in ship hijacked by Somali pirates
	
It has been confirmed that eight Sri Lankans were on board the tanker that is believed to have been hijacked by Somali pirates off the seas of Djibouti on Monday, the Sri Lanka Navy said. 
Navy Spokesman Lt. Commander Chaminda Walakuluge said the French Maritime Rescue Co-ordination Center (MRCC) had informed the Rescue Coordinating Center (RCC) in Sri Lanka of the incident.
Disputing the prior belief that the ship sailed under a Sri Lankan flag, the Navy spokesman said the ship was infact owned by a company based in the United Arab Emirates and sailed under the flag of the Comoros Island. 
The UAE company confirmed that the eight Sri Lankans were part of the crew. We will request the vessels in the area to look into the incident and the whereabouts of the crew, the spokesman said. 
The pirates had chased the tanker, Aris 13, on two high speed boats before capturing it in between Djibouti and Somalia.
International news agencies reported that the incident would be the first successful hijack of a commercial ship by Somali pirates since 2012. At least eight suspected pirates were involved in the attack.
An aircraft from the regional EU Naval Force had flown overhead to track the ships progress and tried to determined what had happened. 
The ship had sent a distress call and then turned off its tracking system. It isnow reportedly anchored near the Puntland's Alula district in Caluula, Somalia.
At its peak in 2010/11, Somali piracy had an economic impact of around $7 billion, with more than 1,000 hostages taken captive with pirates receiving multi-million-dollar ransoms each month.
Meanwhile, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said the Ministry was taking action to verify the news, and initial enquiries had revealed that the vessel involved was not registered under Sri Lankan flag, but it did have eight Sri Lankans were among the crew.
The Ministry continues to remain in touch with the shipping agents, concerned authorities, as well as relevant Sri Lankan Missions overseas to ascertain further information on the matter in order to ensure the safety and welfare of the Sri Lankan crew, the Ministry said.
Therefore, as and when confirmed information becomes available, the Ministry will share information in a manner that would not be prejudicial to the safety of the crew, the Ministry said.(Darshana Sanjeewa)

It is famous as a beach paradise thronged by local and foreign visitors.

Kanyakumari was known as Cape Comorin during the British regime. After independence, the states of India were separated on a linguistic basis. As a result, Kanyakumari separated from the Kerala state, as the majority of people were Tamils. Apart from geographical and environmental significance, Kanyakumari also has historical and religious importance connected with the Hindu community, another reason for the increasing number of national and international visitors. The Lands End is unique because it gives tourists the ultimate travelling experience. 
The name Kanyakumari was derived from the Hindu Goddess Kumari Amman. The Temple of the Hindu Goddess Kumari Amman is an important place to visit in any travellers diary. 
According to Hindu beliefs and mythology, Kanya Devi aka Parvati, was to marry Lord Shiva but the marriage did not take place. Some say Lord Shiva did not show up at the wedding. As a result, Kanya Devi remained a virgin, called Kanya Kumari. She is now considered a virgin goddess in the Hindu religion. The Hindus believe that if you make a wish inside the Kumari Amman Temple, the probability for the wish being fulfilled is high due to the power of the goddess. With such wishes in mind, thousands of Hindu devotees, people from every part of India and abroad visit the temple everyday. There is no peak season at the temple. When we visited, we noticed a few foreigners who had applied Raktha Chandanam (red sandalwood powder) on their foreheads, waiting in the queue to enter the temple. The temple also has fascinating architecture from the ancient period.

The twin rocks in the seas off the Kumari Amman Temple are believed to have been created in memory of the famous Indian philosopher Swami Vivekananda. Swami Vivekananda, a Hindu monk, is a celebrated spiritual leader in India. Visitors are brought to see the rocks and surroundings via ferry services. The ferry journey from the sea to the land to the Vivekananda rocks is fully worth the fee.
Adjoining the rocks is the Thiruvalluvar Statue, a 133 ft monument situated at a distance of 400m from the Kanyakumari coastline. The area surrounding the statue is also very attractive. Hindus say the statue was built in memory of the famous Indian Tamil poet and saint Thiruvalluvar. The ferry journey takes visitors to both the Vivekananda rocks and the Thiruvalluvar statue. The wonderful sight of the sunrise and sunset in Kanyakumari is beyond description, because both the sunset and the moon can be seen simultaneously on the horizon over the ocean on full moon days. Thousands of people gather every morning and evening to experience this sight.

Vattakottai Fort (Circular Fort) is another tourist spot in the Kanyakumari town. The Vattakottai Fort is said to have been built in the 18th Century by the Dutch Captain Eustachius De Lannoy of the Dutch East India Company in the Kingdom of Travancore, which is now Kerala. Captain De Lannoy was a former Dutch naval officer who lived during the rule of King Marthanda Varma of the Travancore Kingdom. The fort was constructed with large blocks of rectangular granite and 25-26 ft high walls as a military base to protect the Kumari Harbour. The Fort is currently maintained by the Indian Archaeological Department. 
Since the town is in a coastal area, there are plenty of stalls and outlets where you can buy ornaments, jewellery and household items made out of seashells. Saris, textiles and handloom garments are also worth a buy. Shopping in Kanyakumari is a pretty good shopping experience as the goods are reasonably priced. If you enjoy the beauty of nature, you will not be disappointed by a trip to Kanyakumari, where you can visit the Swami Vivekananda Rock Memorial, Kumari Amman Temple, Thiruvalluvar Statue and the Gandhi Memorial.

2016  worst year for children in Syria: UNICEF
	
SYRIA, UNICEF, 13.03.2017 - UNICEF reported Monday, hundreds of children were killed in Syria in 2016, the most since UNICEF began keeping records. 
Geert Cappelaere, UNICEFs Middle East regional chief said the depth of suffering is unprecedented. 
According to the report the number of children killed in the war is the highest tally since UNICEF began verifying the number of deaths in the conflict. Mondays report says schools, hospitals, playgrounds and other areas children usually use are becoming increasingly unsafe as they are targets for attacks. UNICEF says at least 255 children were killed in or near schools in 2016.

The grim report adds 6 million children in Syria depend on humanitarian aid, but about 250,000 children remain in besieged areas, cut off from receiving aid. A lack of medical assistance and doctors has lead to more children dying from easily treatable illnesses or injuries the report added.
