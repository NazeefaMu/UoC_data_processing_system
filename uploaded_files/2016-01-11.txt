Constitution with basic structure that cannot be changed: Kiriella
	
	The government is looking towards compiling a Constitution with a basic structure that cannot be changed forever, Senior Minister and Leader of the House Lakshman Kiriella said yesterday.
	Mr. Kiriella told a media briefing that the intention of the government is to compile a Constitution with a basic structure that cannot be amended even if all 225 members of Parliament vote in favour of such a change.
	Accordingly, he said no provisions will be provided in the new Constitution to change the Independence of the Judiciary and the Independent Commissions such as the Election Commission.
	However, he said there would be provisions for other amendments. Responding to a question raised by the journalists as to whether a process of compiling of enacting a new Constitution would be included in the new system of governance which the government is looking at, the Minister said such a decision is yet to be made.
	Further, the Minister said the government will not change the existing Unitary Status and the Status of Buddhism which is guaranteed by the present Constitution. ?Nothing is going to happen to the Unitary Status of the country and to Buddhism and there is no need to instil fear in the minds of the people even before a Constitution is drafted,? he said.
	He said the government had adopted a democratic process by inviting the general public to come up with their proposals and through holding a referendum for the first time in the history of this country. ?We have adopted this approach as a means of ending the history of drop catches, which this country had gone through during the past years,? he said stating that the opportunity which the country has got today should not be missed.

New policy on police recruitments, promotions and transfers
	
	The Police Department will adopt a new policy regarding recruitments, promotions and transfers. The policy has been referred to the National Police Commission, police spokesman ASP Ruwan Gunasekara said yesterday.
	He said the need for a new policy had been stressed for a long time.
	The need for such a policy was vital, as the procedures had been changed many times in the past due to political interference, he said.
	He said it would give the public and those who wish to join the service a clear indication of the necessary qualifications, and those in service what it takes to move up.
	It is also important to have a policy regarding transfers and, therefore, a new procedure has been formulated, he said.
	There will be new procedures for the recruitment and promotion of inspectors and senior gazetted officers
	The department will recruit policemen to three different ranks; namely, constables, sub inspectors (with educational qualifications of having passed the G.C.E Advanced Level) and assistant superintendents (with a bachelor?s degree or higher).
	The procedures for recruitment of sub inspectors and ASPs have been sent for approval to the NPC. The procedures for recruiting police constables and constable drivers are still being formulated.
	The new policy is to individually look into the promotions of inspectors, ASPs and deputy inspectors general.
	The procedures were referred to the NPC last week and will come into effect once the NPC approves them.(Kurulu Koojana Kariyakarawana)

Two opposing forces blocking new constitution: JVP
	
Two opposing forces are preventing the enacting of a new constitution which is more suitable for the country through a proper democratic process, the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) said today.
JVP Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake told a media briefing that the government was trying to sweep important issues under the carpet by taking cover behind the new constitution while some forces in the opposition are opposing the enactment of a new constitution just to cover up criticism against them with regard to acts of large scale corruption committed by them when in power.
He accused Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe of attempting to have his own way when enacting a new constitution by suppressing the other political parties.
Mr. Dissanayake said the issue was not with the provisions preventing rulers acting against the nation?s interests but doing things underhand.
Citing an example, he said the government was planning to give the chairpersons of district development committees? similar perks given to cabinet ministers.
?This is an act which goes beyond the constitutional provisions of limiting the number of cabinet ministers, state and deputy ministers,? he said and added that national reconciliation could not be brought with constitutional provisions.
Mr. Dissanayake said the process of enacting the constitution should be one where the rights of all 225 members are respected unlike the resolution presented to Parliament.
However, he said his party was still positive that a new constitution which was most democratic could be enacted through a democratic process and that his party would make sure that unhealthy proposals would not come inside chocolate wrappers. (YP)

	United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein would visit Sri Lanka in the first-half of February, Resident Coordinator of United Nations in Sri Lanka Subinay Nandy said today.
	He revealed this while paying a courtesy call on Minister Rishad Bathiudeen at his Ministry.
	He said among High Commissioner Zeid?s points of focus in Sri Lanka, would be issues of IDPs stranded in Puttalam and other areas of the country.
	?He is also pleased with Sri Lanka?s present leadership and their commitment towards the minorities,? he said.
	However, Mr. Bathiudeen had gone beyond his call of duty in the IDP cause, Nandy said.
	?You always went beyond the call of your duty. In my discussions with Lankan political leaders I stressed that other IDPs too have to be re-settled. It is interesting to note that Muslim IDP issue has resurfaced again.
	?I never see any difference among various Sri Lankans. We at the UN see our roles beyond our jobs. Looking at Sri Lanka?s present leadership and their commitment, I am pleased that there?s a frank discussion taking place on securing the status of minorities,? he said.

UNP-SLFP consensus on resolution
	
	The SLFP said today the nine-point amendment presented by them on the resolution to convert Parliament into a Constitutional Assembly was accepted by the UNP and the resolution was likely to be passed in Parliament tomorrow.
	The resolution was not approved on Saturday at the special parliamentary session for the purpose because of disagreements on the resolution presented by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe among opposition members including the SLFP.
	Minister Susil Premajayantha told a media conference at the SLFP office today that the UNP and the SLFP had reached a consensus to refer to the upcoming Constitution as ?A Constitution and not as ?New Constitution?, to remove the preface of the resolution, not to suspend Standing Orders in full but only when necessary, fully remove pages 4 and 5 containing 24 points, the necessity to pass the resolution with a two-thirds majority and a referendum and give the full freedom to any citizen to seek redress from the Supreme Court if he or she disagrees with the Constitution or any of its parts.
	?We had several rounds of talks with President Maithripala Sirisena, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremsinghe and other opposition parties and were able to come to a compromise.
	We do not believe in opposing for opposing sake. Each and every move of the UNP-led government and ther consensus among the two major political parties on an extremely important national issue is good for the country and promotes and strengthens the concept of good governance,? the minister said.
	He assured that a new Constitution would be passed in accordance with the provisions of the 1978 Constitution and the Constitutional Assembly for the purpose would be set up under the Standing Orders of the current Parliament.
	The minister said the Constitutional Assembly with the participation of all members of Parliament to draft the New Constitution must not meet outside Parliament like what happened when drafting the 1972 Costitution because it would be drafted under the provisions of the 1978 Constitution.
	?The Constituent Assembly to draft the 1972 Constitution met at the New Town Hall because the 1972 Republiccan Constitution broke away from the Soulbury Constitution whereas Ceylon (Sri Lanka) remained under the British Monarchy,? he said.
	Deputy Minister Dilan Perera said certain members of the opposition making desperate but futile attempts to spread falsehoods, fabrications and utter lies on the new Constitution.
	The SLFP was fully confident that there would be no threats to the nation, country, Buddhism or to the armed forces as these trouble-makers are trying to make out. The deputy minister challenge former minister G.L. Peiris to come for a debate with him to prove that Buddhism, the nation, the country and armed forces would be under threat after the new Constitution was enacted. ?I have worked with him as his deputy when he served as the Constitutional Affairs Minister under Chandrika Kumaratunga regime and he should know better if there was any such threat to the country. Mr. Peiris must not stoop to this level just because he is out of power and has lost his perks and privileges,? he said Ministers Faizer Musthapha and Anura Priyadharshana Yapa also spoke.
