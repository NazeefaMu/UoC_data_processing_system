50 SLFP MPs want Dinesh as Opp. Leader: Vasu
	
UPFA MP Vasudeva Nanayakkara today said about 50 Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) MPs had signed a document to be submitted to the Speaker of the House requesting MP Dinesh Gunwardane be appointed as the Opposition Leader.
He said the signatures have been collected since Wednesday.
?The Parliamentarians want a new Opposition Leader to speak on behalf of them against the coalition government of the United National Party and the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP),? he said.
MP Nanayakkara on Monday proposed MP Gunawardane to be appointed as the Opposition Leader claiming it was unethical for the SLFP to hold both Cabinet Ministerial posts as well as the position of the Opposition Leader.
Speaker Chamal Rajapaksa said on Tuesday he was also in a dilemma regarding the Opposition Leader?s post, and that he would give his ruling in the near future. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Colombo Port City project back on track
	
China's biggest investment project in Sri Lanka, the Colombo Port City Project which was suspended for months by the new government is to continue, Assistant Minister of Chinese Foreign Affairs Liu Jianchao said.
According Jianchao, Sri Lankan President Maithripala Sirisena has told Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping on Thursday that ?what happened around the port city of Colombo is temporary and the problem does not lie with the Chinese side?.
Sirisena's administration has ordered a review of the $1.4 billion Colombo port city project over allegations of wrongdoing since he took office in January.
The suspension caused concern to the Chinese who defended the project as being in line with local laws. China, which has invested millions of dollars in Sri Lanka's infrastructure, is now the island's biggest backer.
Aaccording to China Daily, Liu has told reporters that Sirisena said Sri Lanka is appreciative of China's support and assistance for the development of major infrastructure projects, including a new international port at Hambantota.
The Sri Lankan president promised that his country will continue to provide good conditions and environment for China's investment, Liu said.
China ?puts Sri Lanka in an important position in neighborhood diplomacy?, Xi said during the meeting, pledging that the two sides will continue to deepen cooperation in every sector.

<U+200B>Electoral reforms: Decision within 10 days
	
	Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe on Thursday said a decision on the new electoral system would be taken by political parties within the next 10 days.?
Speaking at a meeting with newspaper editors and media institution heads at Temple Trees, the Prime Minister said there was consensus on eliminating the Proportional Representative System and move towards a mix of the First-past-the-post and the Proportional Representative systems.?
He said that there were discussions at the moment on the numbers that would be elected by direct vote and the proportional system and a decision on the new electoral system which would come as the 20th Amendment to the Constitution would be taken within the next 10 days. He said that whatever that is agreed on electoral reforms would be put before Parliament thereafter.
When asked as to when a next General election would be held the Prime Minister said: ?According to the 100 day program our work is over by April 23. At some stage we have to talk about dissolution,? he said.?
Speaking about reconciliation the Prime Minister said that a new office headed by ex-President Chandrika Kumaratunga would be established to look into matters pertaining to reconciliation. He said that it would be established through Parliament and the board would consist of members nominated by the government as well as the Opposition Leader.?
He added that there were discussions with South Africa on looking at modalities of establishing a ?Truth Commission? in the lines of the ?Truth and reconciliation Commission in South Africa. However the Prime Minister noted that it would take into consideration the political, cultural and historical background of Sri Lanka. He said that each country has its own legal and political structures and such a commission would be established taking these matters into consideration. He added that all such processes should not get dragged on as it would only hinder reconciliation.?
He also said that the Maxwell Paranagama Commission appointed by the previous government is continuing its work and the present government had decided to retain the services of the panel of experts that assist the commission including Sir Desmond de Silva as they had carried out a certain amount of work.?
He said that the country was facing a challenge with a UNHRC resolution in Geneva. He said that if a resolution was passed against Sri Lanka it could have led to many problems as the European Union could have imposed immediate sanctions. He said that Russia was facing a problem due to such EU sanctions.?
He noted that now the country has the opportunity to move in the path of reconciliation and face such international challenges. He was quick to add that all such resolutions were brought about based on commitments and pledges given by the Rajapaksa regime. He said that certain commitments had been given to the Darusman Committee by ? former Attorney General Mohan Peiris and Sri Lankan Ambassador to UN Palith Kohona during that time.
He said that the country has to deal with reconciliation and Human Rights within a domestic framework. ?It?s not surrendering to anyone in the West,? he said.?
He said that such mechanism should be carried out on the principal that Sri Lanka is not a signatory to the ?Rome Statute.? He added that the best internal guarantee against terrorism was reconciliation.
Speaking about investigations into corruption he said they would stick to the rule of law when investigating such cases and there were a large number of cases and limited manpower to deal with them. He said the Bribery and corruption Commission alone had some 1100 files with them and the new director General had asked for at least 100 police officers to carry out investigations.
When asked about the Port City project the Prime Minister said that once the committee looking into it finishes the report it would be forwarded to the Chinese company for their consideration and action. When asked about the concern about the project in China he said: ?We are doing things like the Chinese Communist Party. They had punished officials who were corrupt,? he said.?
?He also said that Sri Lanka?s strategic location in the Indian ocean did not make anyone antagonize Sri Lanka.

Germanwings plane crash: Co-pilot 'wanted to destroy plane'
	
The co-pilot of the Germanwings plane that crashed into the French Alps on Tuesday appeared to want to "destroy the plane", French officials said.
Marseille prosecutor Brice Robin citing information from the "black box" voice recorder has said the co-pilot was alone in the cockpit.
He intentionally started a descent while the pilot was locked out.
Mr. Robin said there was "absolute silence in the cockpit" as the pilot fought to re-enter it, the BBC said.
The co-pilot, now named as Andreas Lubitz, was alive until the final impact, the prosecutors added.
"We hear the pilot ask the co-pilot to take control of the plane and we hear at the same time the sound of a seat moving backwards and the sound of a door closing," Mr Robin told reporters.
"At that moment, the co-pilot is controlling the plane by himself. While he is alone, the co-pilot presses the buttons of the flight monitoring system to put into action the descent of the aeroplane.
"This action on the altitude controls can only be deliberate."
The Airbus 320 from Barcelona to Duesseldorf hit a mountain, killing 150 people, after an eight-minute descent.

Heritance Hotels Achieves Travelife Gold Award
	
Heritance Hotels, Sri Lanka's leading chain of resorts, owned and managed by Aitken Spence Hotels is once again in the forefront of sustainability with all hotels in its portfolio being awarded the Travelife for Hotels & Accommodations Gold award. Travelife ? the international sustainability certification scheme ? assesses a property?s performance in managing social, environmental and economic impacts. The Gold award achieved by Heritance Tea Factory, Heritance Ayurveda Maha Gedara, Heritance Kandalama and Heritance Ahungalla is a testament to the chain?s deep commitment to sustainability.?
Travelife is a practical tool which assists properties to monitor and manage their social and environmental impacts. The scheme which is supported by some of the largest tour operators in the industry helps hotels cut costs and increase sales, by improved sustainability. To gain Travelife Gold certification the hotel must meet the 150 sustainability criteria set by the scheme. This includes environmental issues, such as minimising waste and use of energy, water and chemicals, as well as taking positive action on social issues, such as employee welfare, working with the local community, child protection and human rights. Hotels must display how they are helping to support local businesses and protect local traditions and wildlife.
The Heritance Hotels portfolio underwent a stringent audit process which focussed on energy saving practices, waste management, emission and environmental sustainability principles followed by each Hotel. The audit results are scored on Bronze, Silver or Gold depending on the degree of the Hotels commitment towards the environment and locality in which it operates. Achieving Gold status is not an easy feat and it is a remarkable achievement that the entire chain achieved this accolade.?
Heritance Hotels, a pioneer in practicing and promoting sustainable tourism in Sri Lanka, has taken numerous initiatives in ensuring that energy consuming assets have been managed effectively and energy conserving technology has been implemented at each resort. Heritance Ahungalla, one of Sri Lanka's leading beach resorts, was the first hotel in Sri Lanka to receive the ISO 50001:2011 certification. Heritance Ayurveda Maha Gedara, was the first net metered hotel in Sri Lanka and Heritance Tea Factory and Heritance Kandalama were the first in the hospitality industry to utilize a biomass gasifier as a renewable energy source. Apart from the significant systems implemented at the resorts, all resorts use Sewage Treated Plant (STP) water for irrigation and have replaced incandescent lighting with CFL and LED lights.
The 7R recycling program practiced by all resorts in the chain strives for zero waste to the environment. All waste produced is recycled or disposed of with no impact to the environment in which each hotel operates. Heritance Ahungalla, Heritance Kandalama and Heritance Tea Factory have in-house green pavilions and eco centers where training is provided to guests and the community on the benefits and importance of recycling and reducing the impacts on the environment.?
Heritance Kandalama has been identified as a bio diversity hot spot with surveys revealing that the ?170 acres of owned and 50 acres of leased land preserved by the Hotel ?has 43 species of mammals, 173 species of birds, 33 species of reptiles, 8 species of amphibians, 82 species of butterflies and 125 floral species including trees and climbers.

## Title: Pilot was locked out of cockpit before crash ?

Pilot was locked out of cockpit before crash ?
	
	New York Times : As officials struggled Wednesday to explain why a jet with 150 people on board crashed in relatively clear skies, an investigator said evidence from a cockpit voice recorder indicated one pilot left the cockpit before the plane?s descent and was unable to get back in.
	A senior military official involved in the investigation described ?very smooth, very cool? conversation between the pilots during the early part of the flight from Barcelona to D?sseldorf. Then the audio indicated that one of the pilots left the cockpit and could not re-enter.
	?The guy outside is knocking lightly on the door and there is no answer,? the investigator said. ?And then he hits the door stronger and no answer. There is never an answer.?
	He said, ?You can hear he is trying to smash the door down.?
	While the audio seemed to give some insight into the circumstances leading up to the Germanwings crash on Tuesday morning, it also left many questions unanswered.
	?We don?t know yet the reason why one of the guys went out,? said the official, who requested anonymity because the investigation is continuing. ?But what is sure is that at the very end of the flight, the other pilot is alone and does not open the door.?
	The data from the voice recorder seems only to deepen the mystery surrounding the crash and provides no indication of the condition or activity of the pilot who remained in the cockpit. The descent from 38,000 feet over about 10 minutes was alarming but still gradual enough to indicate that the twin-engine Airbus A320 had not been damaged catastrophically. At no point during the descent was there any communication from the cockpit to air traffic controllers or any other signal of an emergency.
	When the plane plowed into craggy mountains northeast of Nice, it was traveling with enough speed that it was all but pulverized, killing the 144 passengers and crew of six and leaving few clues.
	The French aviation authorities have made public very little, officially, about the nature of the information that has been recovered from the audio recording, and it was not clear whether it was partial or complete. France?s Bureau of Investigations and Analyses confirmed only that human voices and other cockpit sounds had been detected and would be subjected to detailed analysis.
	Asked about the new evidence revealed in the cockpit recordings, Martine del Bono, a bureau spokeswoman, declined to comment. ?Our teams continue to work on analyzing the CVR,? she said, referring to the cockpit voice recorder. ?As soon as we have accurate information we intend to hold a press conference.?
	Meanwhile, prosecutors in Marseille, who have been tasked with a separate criminal inquiry into the crash, could not immediately be reached for comment. Brice Robin, the Marseille prosecutor, was due to meet Thursday morning with the families of the crash victims.
	At the crash site, a senior official working on the investigation said, workers found the casing of the plane?s other black box, the flight data recorder, but the memory card containing data on the plane?s altitude, speed, location and condition was not inside, apparently having been thrown loose or destroyed by the impact.
	The flight?s trajectory ahead of the crash also left many unanswered questions.
	R?mi Jouty, the director of the French Bureau of Investigations and Analyses, said at a news conference that the plane took off at around 10 a.m. local time from Barcelona and that the last message sent from the pilot to air traffic controllers had been at 10:30 a.m., which indicated that the plane was proceeding on course.
	But minutes later, the plane inexplicably began to descend, Mr. Jouty said. At 10:40 and 47 seconds, the plane reported its last radar position, at an altitude of 6,175 feet. ?The radar could follow the plane until the point of impact,? he said.
	Mr. Jouty said the plane slammed into a mountainside and disintegrated, scattering debris over a wide area, and making it difficult to analyze what had happened.
	It often takes months or even years to determine the causes of plane crashes, but a little more than a year after the disappearance of a Malaysian airlines jetliner that has never been found, the loss of the Germanwings flight is shaping up to be particularly perplexing to investigators.
	One of the main questions outstanding is why the pilots did not communicate with air traffic controllers as the plane began its unusual descent, suggesting that either the pilots or the plane?s automated systems may have been trying to maintain control of the aircraft as it lost altitude.
	Among the theories that have been put forward by air safety analysts not involved in the investigation is the possibility that a pilot could have been incapacitated by a sudden event such as a fire or a drop in cabin pressure.
	A senior French official involved in the investigation, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said that the lack of communication from the pilots during the plane?s descent was disturbing, and that the possibility that their silence was deliberate could not be ruled out.
	?I don?t like it,? said the French official, who cautioned that his initial analysis was based on the very limited information currently available. ?To me, it seems very weird: this very long descent at normal speed without any communications, though the weather was absolutely clear.?
	?So far, we don?t have any evidence that points clearly to a technical explanation,? the official said. ?So we have to consider the possibility of deliberate human responsibility.?
	Mr. Jouty said it was far too early in the investigation to speculate about possible causes.
	?At this moment I have no beginning of a scenario,? Mr. Jouty said. However, he said there was not yet any evidence available that would support either a theory of a depressurization or of a midair explosion
	Speaking on the French radio station RTL, Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve said on Wednesday morning that terrorism was not a likely ?hypothesis at the moment,? but that no theories had been definitively excluded. He said the size of the area over which debris was scattered suggested that the aircraft had not exploded in the air but rather had disintegrated on impact.
	Lufthansa, the parent company of Germanwings, has characterized the crash as an accident. The airline has not disclosed the identities of the pilots, except to say that the captain was a 10-year veteran with more than 6,000 hours of flying time in A320s.
	The French Bureau of Investigations and Analyses, which is leading the technical inquiry into the crash, sent seven investigators to the crash site on Tuesday. They have been joined by their counterparts from Germany, as well as by technical advisers from Airbus and CFM International, the manufacturer of the plane?s engines.
	Speaking on Europe 1 radio, Jean-Paul Troadec, a former director of the French air accident investigation bureau, said one of the big challenges for investigators would be to protect the debris at the crash site from any inadvertent damage.
	?We need to ensure that all the evidence is well preserved,? Mr. Troadec said, referring both to the pieces of the plane littered across the steep slopes as well as to the remains of the victims. The identification of the victims will most likely require matching DNA from the remains with samples from relatives.
	The recovery effort will be a laborious task, given the state of the wreckage, the difficult terrain and the fact that the crash site is so remote that it could be reached only by helicopter.
	Cabin depressurization, one of the possibilities speculated about on Wednesday, has occurred before, perhaps most notably in the crash of a Cypriot passenger plane in 2005 that killed all 121 people on board as it approached Athens. In that case, Helios Airways Flight 522, a slow loss of pressure rendered both pilots and all the passengers on the Boeing 737 jet unconscious for more than three-quarters of an hour before the aircraft ran out of fuel and slammed into a wooded gorge near the Greek capital.
	Investigators eventually determined that the primary cause of that crash was a series of human errors, including deficient maintenance checks on the ground and a failure by the pilots to heed emergency warning signals.

?China has always placed Sri Lanka in an important diplomatic position in region,? Xi said.
President Sirisena met with the Chinese Leader on Thursday in Beijing and held talks amid efforts to recalibrate former President Mahinda Rajapaksa?s strong pro-China policies.
The two sides were considered likely to discuss the 1.5 billion USD, China-funded port city project in Colombo, which the Sri Lankan government suspended pending scrutiny of environment impacts and alleged corruption, foreign media reported.
President Sirisena's administration has also ordered reviews on all Chinese-funded projects.
According to reports, the President wishes to balance Sri Lanka's China ties against those with India, since India has become increasingly concerned about new Chinese economic and military inroads in the Indian Ocean. (The Hindu)

?I called her that day and her phone was busy,? the 32-year-old said. ?I went to the villa where she worked and she was still on the phone, so I asked her who she was talking to. She said she was talking to her lover because she wanted to spend the night with him, so I got furious,? he said.
The victim?s cousin, who works as a maid in the same area, said that on the day of the murder the victim called her and told her she had fought with her husband.

US says SL to face tough challenges
	
Though President Maithripala Sirisena was pivoting the country away from the harmful policies of his predecessor, the US government said Sri Lanka would face tough challenges in the months ahead including the financial mess they have inherited.
?The Sri Lankan people, and the Sirisena government, face tough challenges in the months ahead including the financial mess they inherited. But I want to reiterate the assurances made by President Barrack Obama and Secretary Kerry that the US looks forward to deepening our partnership with Sri Lanka and working with them to advance democracy,? US Assistant Secretary of State for South and Central Asian Affairs Nisha Desai Biswal said.
Addressing the house of foreign affairs subcommittee on Asia and the Pacific on Tuesday, she said that this commitment was not reflected in the President?s budget request for assistance to Sri Lanka.
?I would like to underscore that this budget request was written before Sri Lanka?s democratic transition and reflects the more constrained environment created by the previous government, which forced us to draw down our programs. That is not the Sri Lanka of today and we see tremendous opportunities to assist the country in improving governance, accountability, commerce, and more. We look forward to working closely with this committee and with key committees in the House and Senate to explore options for supporting the democratic transition in Sri Lanka,? she said.
Ms. Biswal said that the prospects for strengthened democratic institutions, equitable economic growth, and reduced ethnic tensions were much greater under President Sirisena?s leadership than they were during the previous regime.
?President Sirisena, working in a government of national unity with Sinhalese and minority political parties, is pivoting the country away from the harmful policies of his predecessor. His coalition took actions that reflect their commitment to a comprehensive governance reform agenda, including development assistance and support for civil society and vulnerable communities,? she said.
