A two-faced Phantom is haunting the landscape!
	
Dissanayake, a newcomer to Parliament in 1970, attracted a great deal of attention
Both Dudley and JRJ treated Dissanayake like their prodigy
Premadasa?s beginnings were rather unambiguous
?
?It is far more difficult to murder a phantom than a reality.??
~Virginia Woolf
?
The United National Party (UNP) has somewhat a mixed record in governance. While on the sphere of the country?s economy it has had a praiseworthy score, its allegiance to socio-political liberalism, especially amongst a nationalist-minded Sinhalese Buddhist majority, has created quite a negative image. This has contributed to a rapid erosion of its voter base during the past two to three decades. That erosion of votes is particularly manifested in Parliamentary elections.?
The performance at the recently held LG elections is just an emphatic illustration of that policy. Yet the J R Jayewardene (JRJ) era stands out as a period that really changed the country?s historical path. The socio-political changes that were introduced to a land, that was dragged down to the depths of economic disaster and social subservience, have withstood many a storm of ridicule and insult from an opposition that hasn?t contributed an iota of progressive reform except state-owned enterprises.?
That political machinery JRJ presided over was manned by some educated (except R.Premadasa, although lacked formal education in a conventional sense, was very practical-minded and street smart) and bright students of politics. It resembled a classroom of extremely bright students under the safe umbrella of an exceptionally brilliant professor. R.Premadasa, Gamini Dissanayake, Lalith Athulathmudali, Nissanka Wijeratne, Ronnie de Mel, Gamani Jayasuriya and A.C.S Hameed were a batch of Cabinet Ministers who could turn any stagnant political-economy into a moving wheel of progressive growth and social development. And they just did that like a team of swashbuckling modern-day twenty-twenty cricket team.??
However, from amongst these bright stars of J RJ?s team of management, two shone as extra bright ones. They were R. Premadasa and Gamini Dissanayake. The writer was briefed by a close friend and a person who was in the employ and happened to be the unofficial Chief of Staff of Gamini Dissanayake. The writer has no reason whatsoever to doubt the veracity and authenticity of the brief either. For easy reference of the reader, we?ll call him Mr. X. According to Mr. X, in the early days of the political career of Gamini Dissanayake, in the early to mid-seventies, Premadasa used to get on with Dissanayake quite well. At the time Dissanayake, a newcomer to Parliament in 1970, attracted a great deal of attention from both the media and those who were interested in politics in Parliament and outside. During Dudley Senanayake?s period from 1970 ? 1973, until his death, both Dudley and JRJ treated Dissanayake like their prodigy, encouraging him at every turn of events.
Premadasa, being a politician with immense ego and ambition, was not a person not to notice this special attention given to a newcomer. All the accolades flowing towards Dissanayake from the two leaders of the Party did not go unnoticed by him. Premadasa?s beginnings were rather unambiguous. Yet his achievements in the field of politics are beyond compare. A determined man to the core of his being, R Premadasa in the context of Sri Lankan politics was an exception. His exceptionalism lay in the way he conducted himself in public. A man with immense personal energy, Premadasa, at the time, when the UNP was in the Opposition benches, set an example for up and coming UNP Parliamentarians and electorate organizers.?
A politician with colossal ambition yet determined to follow a disciplined schedule to fulfill his ambition, reminded one of an athlete training for Olympics. Meeting his constituents at 4 o?clock in the morning, preparing his speeches for forthcoming rallies, handing research on various projects to his selected Government servants and other academics, visiting Sirikotha, Premadasa was truly an epitome of a leader. The goals he set for himself were achieved through commitment, hard work and personal dedication.?
?
Feared more than being respected?
With all these positive traits of a leader, Premadasa lacked one crucial character of a great one;? he lacked a sense of security. On the contrary, JRJ was quintessentially secure in his leadership of the party. While JRJ never had to look over his shoulder to see whether there was any one? pulling him back, Premadasa?s journey was fraught with a constant barrage of insults, abuses and vitriol. Yet he managed to attain his goal in the midst of an unprecedented series of violence and turmoil. His passion for revenge and propensity for Stalinist type of governance made him not the envy of Sri Lankan political society of the day; it made him a leader who was more feared than respected by his followers. Eventually his flirtations with Prabhakaran and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Elam (LTTE) took its toll. A man who performed miraculous feats when he was the Premier under JRJ could do no miracles when he was the President of the country. His tenure as President lasted a mere three years. At the time he was bombed down by the LTTE, Premadasa was an unpopular leader and that was vicariously displayed by the lighting of fire crackers at his death. His son, Sajith, is considered as an automatic alternative to UNP Leader Ranil Wickremasinghe.?
?
Dissanayake?s potential?
Dissanayake?s story is different. He was first elected to Parliament in 1970. He was one of 17 MPs elected in an election debacle, in a real sense of electoral loss, greater than that which the UNP suffered in 1956. Dissanayake was the only new UNPer in Parliament when giants like M D Banda, E L B Hurulle, Montague Jayawickrama and others fell. One person other than Dudley Senanayake and JRJ saw Dissanayake?s potential and that person wanted to destroy his career at the very outset. He was Felix Dias Bandaranaike. At an election petition initiated by Felix Dias Bandaranaike, Dissanayake was unseated and the case looked quite strong. However, in order to bring another Parliamentarian, Nanda Ellawela-who got knocked off at another election petition- back into Parliament, an Act to Amendment the Ceylon (Parliamentary Elections) Order in Council 1946 was introduced, unwisely assuming that Dissanayake could be knocked off in the soon-to-be-held by-election.
It was not to be. Dissanayake not only won the by-election at a hard-fought battle in Nuwara Eliya. The duo of Felix Dias Bandaranaike and Wickrema Weerasooria drew their legendary battle lines along with it. Dissanayake?s rise in Parliament as an able speaker propelled him to be among the elite of parliamentary debaters. A when he fell short of R Premadasa, who had a thirty-year handicap over Dissanayake, by only six (6) measly votes at the UNP Organizers election on a secret ballot, he knew that he had arrived at the doorstep of leadership, a way ahead of time.
The rest, as they say, of Dissanayake?s achievements in such a short span of time that stretched a mere thirteen years, is history. Six colossal reservoirs (Victoria, Kotmale, Maduru Oya, Ulhitiya, Randenigala and Rantembe), 150,000 settler families, thousands of Swarnabhumi land owners, almost every hamlet with electricity, water to a block of land, parched and dry, reaching the pinnacle of cricket for our cricketing lads, are no mean tasks.? ?
Premadasa/Dissanayake, the twin phantom of post-Independent politics in Sri Lanka is dreaded by those who opposed them. Any non-UNP politician, henchman or funder is now beholding the respective offspring of the duo. Sajith Premadasa and Navin Dissanayake can do wonders what minions would take eons to achieve. That is their promise. What has been left of any lasting value and measure by our politicians in the past three to four decades has been left behind by Premadasa and Dissanayake.
Rajapaksas need to worry. Theirs is a legacy of treachery, corruption, nepotism and white vans and disappearances. Navin/Sajith duo may well be the answer to this treachery. It may well be the answer to this social betrayal. Mahinda Rajapaksa knows it. His family knows it and above all, Wickremasinghe knows it. Wickremesinghe has to make use of this duo. If not, the UNP is doomed. Therein lies the answer.

Alarm grows as Ebola is confirmed in Congo city
	
?
By ? Max Bearak?
(c) 2018, The Washington Post May 18, 2018 -? ?NAIROBI, Kenya - Congo has confirmed a case of Ebola in Mbandaka, a city of 1.2 million, marking the first urban case in the latest outbreak, which is now the most serious since the epidemic that raged across West Africa between 2014 and 2016.??
Ebola is much harder to contain in urban areas, so this development compounds the risk of contagion. The World Health Organization?s lead response official called the new confirmed case ?a game changer.???
Previously, confirmed cases had been limited to a remote area more than 100 miles south of Mbandaka, in the rain forest of Congo?s Equateur province. The new, urban case is only the third confirmed case of the current outbreak; 20 others are probable, and 21 are suspected, bringing the total of potential cases to 44. The death toll stands at 23.?

Can't compare JVP with LTTE: Champika
	
Minister Champika Ranawaka said yesterday the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) could not be compared with the LTTE.
He said this at the 2018 Virudana Ranaviru Upahara or commemoration of war heroes organised by the JHU at the Mihindu Seth Madura in Attidiya.
The minister said though the JVP was responsible for a large number of political killings, it never conducted any mass killings or destroyed religious places of worship.
He said there were a group of people in this society that see the crimes committed by the LTTE as heroic acts, but requested the people to remain calm and act intelligently to defeat them.
The minister said there were no Tamil political prisoners in this country.
?There are 56 LTTE suspects detained, against whom lawsuits had been filed, and there are another nine individuals pending court cases. There are also some security forces personnel in prison on various charges,? he said.
The minister said in 2010 some 12,260 LTTE leaders were released and the country had to pay that price now. He said the security personnel who are in custody did not commit crime for their personal benefit but had only acted on the orders from their superiors, who are now living in comfort.
He said some 26,000 soldiers were killed and some 17,000 were disabled as a result of the 30-year war -- 23,000 LTTEers were killed while some 9,000 civilians belonging to all ethnic groups were killed by the LTTE.
The minister said according to records, some 5,000 Tamils were killed as a result of this war, and that the Government has the responsibility to take care of those who were injured.
He said a small group of people was attempting to venerate LTTE Leader Velupillai Prabhakaran and lead the country towards darkness again.
Venerable Omalpe Sobitha Thera said some separatist groups attempted to make May 18 a national day of mourning.
?This day should be celebrated with joy as it is the day we received freedom from a 30-year war. Some attempt to compare the JVP with the LTTE. What the JVP did was political as it attempted to topple the government, but the LTTE attempted to separate the country, killing thousands of innocent people. Only those from the diaspora will attempt to justify the commemoration of the LTTE,? the Thera said. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

Disease spreading in South identified as pneumonia: DGHS
	
Laboratory findings have revealed that the disease spreading in Southern Province was a pneumonia outbreak mainly due to influenza virus, Director General of Health Services Dr. Anil Jasinghe yesterday said.
Dr. Jasinghe in a statement said the health authorities had taken measures to mitigate the current situation.
?Attention has been drawn to the increased number of patients with acute respiratory tract infection at Karapitiya Teaching Hospital and General Hospital Matara during last few weeks.? Preliminary investigations of the incident have revealed that there were few deaths among infants of less than one year due to acute respiratory infection during that period,? he said.
He said few hundreds of children were admitted to the peadiatric wards with acute fever and respiratory symptoms during this period and added that? they had experienced increased number of pneumonia cases among children in Matara and Galle districts.
?According to laboratory findings there is evidence suggested of pneumonia outbreak mainly due to influenza virus. During past few years country has experienced increased influenza like illness during months of May, June and July,? he said.
?Public are encouraged to take general personal hygienic measures to prevent spread of respiratory infections such as covering mouth and nose with a tissue, handkerchief while sneezing and coughing when having flu, washing hands with soap and water frequently, avoiding touching face, avoiding overcrowded public places specially when having flu and seeking medical attention for flu? if in a high risk group or when feeling ill,? he said.
?For influenza like illness, children less than 2 years of age, pregnant or lactating mothers, anyone with chronic lung, heart or renal and other co-morbidities, elderly people are considered as high risk categories. It they develop flu like illness, they are advised to seek medical care without delay,? he added.

Gotabaya Rajapaksa?s Economic Vision and Political Mission
	
?
Viyathmaga - has been viewed in most sections of the media as an elitist organization with a predominantly ?Sinhala? membership
The new regime introduced the 19th Constitutional Amendment debarring dual citizens from contesting Parliamentary and Presidential elections in Sri Lanka
Our foremost priority is economic growth to ensure the sustained prosperity and well-being of our people

?
?Viyathmaga? is an organization that claims to be dedicated to the goal of ?an intellectually inspired Sri Lanka?. It is said to possess an elitist membership comprising top level professionals, academics and entrepreneurs of Sri Lanka. The Viyathmaga website describes the organization in the following manner -?The Professionals for a Better Future (VIYATHMAGA) is a network of Academics, Professionals, and Entrepreneurs who love the country and wish to contribute actively towards the development of a prosperous Sri Lanka where all citizens can live in peace and harmony. VIYATHMAGA is not a political organisation. It is a civil society movement, wishing to contribute towards the betterment of the country?.??
?
Viyathmaga articulates its vision as seeking to ?mobilize the nascent potential of the professionals, academics and entrepreneurs to effectively influence the moral and material development of Sri Lanka in par with the other developed countries where all citizens live in an environment of equity and fair play, with equal opportunities in the advancement of these ideals?.??
?
Viyathmaga in its mission statement outlines the following objectives -??
To provide a common forum for Sri Lankan scholars, professionals and academics with patriotism and a sense of purpose, living here and abroad, to network for the noble cause of influencing those policy makers and legislators to steer the country in the correct path with accountability.??
	Conduct Districtwise campaigns and workshops to create broad awareness of the objectives among the like-minded, in order to build up a non-violent, discerning public opinion on matters affecting the livelihood and betterment of all citizens in Sri Lanka.??
	Mobilize the expertise and knowledge of the members of this forum in innovating and developing strategies and policies which would influence the decision making of the government in power, for the greater good of the society.??
	To act as a pressure group to the prospective decision makers in Government and Public bodies to motivate good governance and inculcate democratic values.??
	Identify and project honest, capable and committed individuals in all three tiers of governance.??
	Be an effective and recognized organization capable of interacting with Sri Lankan diaspora domiciled abroad and foreign missions here and abroad for intellectual dialogue on matters concerning Sri Lanka.??
Notwithstanding its avowed lofty ideals - Viyathmaga - in recent times has been viewed in most sections of the media as an elitist organization with a predominantly ?Sinhala? membership that is determined to enthrone former Defence and Urban Decelopment Secretary Nandasena Gotabaya Rajapaksa known popularly as Gota Rajapaksa or ?Gota? in a powerful politico-administrative position in Sri Lanka. Gotabaya Rajapaksa is the chairman of Viyathmaga. Whether this perception is correct or not the current reality today is that a vast number of people share this perception and as is the case in many instances such perceptions are indeed becoming the reality.??
?
Viyathmaga Annual General Meeting
Viyathmaga held its annual General meeting for 2018 in the form of a convention-seminar in the ballroom of plush Shangri-la Hotel at Galle Face. The keynote speech was by Gotabaya Rajapaksa. Among the invitees were former President and elder brother Mahinda Rajapaksa, former Speaker and eldest brother Chamal Rajapaksa, former Economic Development Minister and younger brother Basil Rajapaksa. Gota?s nephew and Hambantota MP Namal Rajapaksa was also an invitee but was absent due to an overseas trip.??
Former Malaysian Prime Minister Dr. Mahathir Mohammed made headlines recently by getting re-elected as Premier again at the age of 92. Mahathir Mohammed is regarded as the foster father of the Malaysian ? Bhumiputra? movement that encouraged economic advancement through preferential treatment for those of Malay ethnicity over those of Chinese, Indian and European descent in Malaysia. One of the highlights of Mahathir Mohammed?s 22 year rule was his unveiling in 1990 of an economic blueprint phased out over 30 years for the betterment of his country. It was themed as Mahathir Mohammed?s ?Vision for 2020?. Likewise in a significant gesture that evoked a sense of Deja Vu vis a vis Mahathir Mohammed, ex-Defence Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa during his Viyathmaga keynote speech also unveiled his own ? Vision 2030? for Sri Lanka. It appeared that Gotabhaya Rajapaksa sought to re-invent himself as a man with an economic vision on a political mission.??
An extensive news report in our sister paper the ?Daily Financial Times? filed by its Editor Nisthar Cassim stated as follows -??
?Former Defence Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa, who is widely speculated to be a 2019 presidential candidate, yesterday unveiled his vision 2030 for Sri Lanka, promising to transform the economy with futuristic policies and measures but more importantly with the right people and execution.???
?He told a packed audience of over 2,000 professionals, business leaders, diplomats, clergy and politicians at the Shangri-La Hotel, Colombo that the future window of opportunity for Sri Lanka for faster economic growth hinges on an intellectually and technology competent society via a social open economic policy.???
?Gotabaya was emphatic when he said the foremost priority was economic growth which was the foundation and the cure for all ills of Sri Lanka. He also emphasised that economic growth and law and order went hand in hand. At the forum, which was attended by former president Mahinda Rajapaksa, Gotabaya said: ?An economy is not built merely through policies, programmes, products, capital inflows and exports. It is driven by the humans who power it in many different capacities???
?
He said the foremost priority was economic growth which is the foundation and the cure for all ills of Sri Lanka
?
China,India,Japan and Indonesia
?What do we need as a society?? he asked the forum before answering they were a socialist democracy, rule of law, fairness and justice, safety and security and a conducive and sustainable environment. He emphasised that professionals, intellects, business leaders, entrepreneurs and society at large as well as the Government had a collective responsibility to ensure this. Noting that global economic power will shift to Asia by 2030 with the region being home to four of the top five economic powers ? China, India, Japan and Indonesia ? Gotabaya asked the forum whether Sri Lanka was ready for this transformation???
?Our foremost priority is economic growth to ensure the sustained prosperity and well-being of our people,? Gotabaya said. In that context, he said the challenge was to transform economic growth and the economy?s structure. This he said could be done only through positive and relevant development initiatives and efficiency of this development process. ?We will open up (for foreign investors and international partners) whilst safeguarding the sovereignty and cultural values of Sri Lanka.???
?Noting that past and current economic policies must be reviewed and improved to reverse policies that harm the economy, Gotabaya went on to outline his vision. Amidst a slew of ideas were thoughts on harnessing new technologies to increase value addition in exports and manufacturing, focusing on skilled labour, a knowledge-based and technology-focused economy, modernising agriculture, private sector and SME development, promoting innovation, research and development, greater local and foreign investments, removal of red tape and better management of state resources, etc.???
?He stressed that infrastructure development was critical for the country but returns would be yielded only in the long run. He said that the State should not invest without analysing market realities in order to obtain optimal returns and that state enterprise must make state funds profitable and ensure employees were given fair wages. ?Investments should be equitable and profitable,? he added.??
Focusing on corruption, he said that State sector corruption was a hindrance for economic growth hence systems and processes must be introduced to ensure officials could not indulge in corruption and politicians of stature and high-calibre state officials should be identified to take lead roles. In summing things up, Gotabaya said it was time to embrace nationalism. ?Love your country, play your part in its future,? he said, reminding people that everyone counts and Sri Lankans had to move beyond divisions of race and religion. ?We are one. Sri Lanka?s future is in our hands,? he stated.??
?
Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna
Well-known journalist and author of the book ?Gota?s War?, C. A. Chandraprema who was also present at the convention, pointed out in an article in ?The Island? that the ?floral arrangement on the lectern was made up entirely of the ?Nelum pohottuwa? the symbol of the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna?. ?The symbolism spoke a thousand words? observed Chandraprema. Relevant Excerpts from Chandraprema?s article -??
?The first to speak was Gotabaya Rajapaksa. He spoke not a word about his previous subjects, national defence and urban development, but solely on economics, spelling out a vision for Sri Lanka for the year 2030 with economic growth being the primary focus.???
?In the run up to this event, the government and their allies provided it with a great deal of publicity saying this was really the commencement of Gota?s presidential election campaign. They had said the same thing about last year?s Viyathmaga annual general meeting and about the inaugural meeting of the Eliya organization as well. However, for those looking for clues relating to intent, this event was replete with what looked like tell tale signs of what was on the cards. The most obvious sign was Gota?s complete shift to economics, and the focus of the entire proceedings being on development and economic affairs alone. Today, it?s the economy that most worries the constituency that was in attendance at that meeting ? the business and professional elite. Indeed it?s a major source or worry for the ordinary man on the street as well and in that sense the pitch was timely and relevant???
?But to those trying to look for clues, Gota?s concentration on the economy could be seen as a move to prove that he was not a one dimensional military man but someone who could shift from fighting a war, to urban development and to economic policy with ease. He said that by 2030, the prognosis was that the Chinese economy was projected to become twice the size of the American economy. India was to come third, Japan fourth and Indonesia will become the fifth. He posed the question whether Sri Lanka was ready for this transformation of the global economy and said that Viyathmaga was engaged in studying how Sri Lanka should be positioned by 2030. Economic growth was posited as the top priority for Sri Lanka. He said that other Asian countries had demonstrated that it is possible to achieve our economic goals and open the country to the world while yet safeguarding our culture and our sovereignty?.??
?The meeting was attended by the ?creme de la creme? of the private sector including the top business magnates and no doubt what they heard from all the speakers, would have been music to their ears. If the private sector was looking for a way out of the morass the country finds itself in today, the Viyathmaga AGM seminar seemed to show the way.???
?Speaker after speaker addressed the audience on an economic vision for the future. All the correct chords were struck at this event. Mano Sekaram, an IT expert who addressed the audience said that the fact that he was invited to speak indicated an appreciation of diversity and inclusiveness and thanked the organisers for that. The panel of speakers included members of all communities and the highlight of the evening was a rehabilitated LTTE cadre turned musician singing two songs in Tamil and Sinhala.???
?
Gota?s Pitch For The Presidency
The author of ?Gota?s War? who is presumed by some as possessing an insight into the mindset of Gotabaya Rajapaksa concludes his piece by opining, ?If anyone was looking for clues that this was Gota?s pitch for the presidency, the whole event seemed replete with evidence that it may indeed be that?.??
Apart from Chandraprema some websites also interpreted or depicted Gota?s speech at the Viyathmaga convention as an indication of his intention to contest the next presidential elections in 2020 as the joint opposition candidate. Gota himself in various interviews has stated that he is not averse to the idea but had not made up his mind yet. In any case ?Gota Malli?has repeatedly pointed out that the final decision would have to be made by ?Mahinda Aiya? - his elder brother Mahinda Rajapaksa. Though there is speculation in some circles that there are differences between the Rajapaksa?s over the presidential stakes, Gota?s responses in interviews has made two things clear. Firstly he would contest only with the approval and support of Mahinda Rajapaksa. Secondly all the Rajapaksa brothers would stand unitedly behind the candidate selected by Mahinda.??
Even though Gotabaya is being talked of as a presidential candidate filling in for Mahinda Rajapaksa, the same 19th Constitutional amendment which blocked Mahinda Rajapaksa from contesting the presidency again has also prevented Gotabaya also from contesting presidential elections since he is a dual citizen of both Sri Lanka and the USA. Prior to the 19th Constitutional Amendment being enacted, it was possible for people with dual citizenship to contest elections in Sri Lanka. When the Sirisena-Wickremesinghe Govt. replaced the Rajapaksa regime in January 2015 , many of the bottlenecks surrounding the obtaining of dual citizenship by Sri Lankan expatriates were removed. Despite these ?dual citizenship friendly? actions, the new regime introduced a problematic provision in the 19th Constitutional Amendment debarring dual citizens from contesting Parliamentary and Presidential elections in Sri Lanka.??
?
He was not a one dimensional military man but someone who could shift from fighting a war, to urban development?
It was widely believed then that the provision was a pre-emptive move to prevent ex-President Rajapaksa?s sibling Gotabaya Rajapaksa from seeking electoral office. Former Defence and Urban development secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa is a controversial personality who is loved by some and hated by others. There is a school of thought in Sri Lanka which is optimistic that Gotabaya Rajapaksa is destined to rule the country in the future just as his elder brother did.?
?
Nineteenth Constitutional Amendment
The Nineteenth Constitutional amendment has reversed the Eighteenth amendment and blocked Mahinda Rajapaksa from contesting for the presidency again. If the envisaged new constitution materialises and the executive presidency is abolished and the Prime ministerial office is further empowered then Mahinda Rajapaksa can or may seek Prime ministerial office. If however, the diluted executive presidency continues to remain then an alternative to Mahinda has to be found. Many think the alternative is Gotabaya. In recent times the Gotabaya fan club has been working overtime promoting the retired Army Colonel as the prospective presidential candidate.??
This support for Gota suffered a minor setback last year when former actress Geetha Kumarasinghe was unseated as Galle District MP by the courts because she was a dual citizen of Sri Lanka and Switzerland. As of now Gotabaya Rajapaksa is a dual citizen holding US citizenship. His only son is well-settled in the US. If Gota is to contest the presidential or Parliamentary poll in the future he would have to give up his US citizenship. In spite of critically denouncing the US at times, Gotabaya has not shown any inclination to renounce his US citizenship so far. Some months ago when Gota addressed the Foreign Correspondents Association in Colombo the ex-Defence secretary was non - committal about renouncing US citizenship and entering active politics. Mahinda too has not been too enthusiastic about Gota contesting polls to date.??
?In any case, the Appeal court ruling upheld by the Supreme Court on Geetha Kumarasinghe has demonstrated that if Gotabaya Rajapaksa wants to be elected to high office then he has to clearly and unequivocally renounce US citizenship. Those in the Sirisena - Wickremesinghe - Kumaratunga camp opine that Gota would never give up his US citizenship. Hence the provision in the 19th amendment was an anticipatory stratagem aimed at keeping Gota out of Parliament and the President?s House. It was based on the premise that Gotabaya would never opt to lose his dual citizenship status. It remains to be seen whether this calculation is correct or not.??
?

?
Despite these doubts about the eligibility or willingness of Gotabaya to contest the presidential poll, recent events indicate that Gotabaya like Barkis the Dickensian character in ?David Copperfield? is now willing. While saying he is yet to make up his mind, the ground reality seems to be that of Gota being ?ready, able and willing? if Mahinda Rajapaksa gives the go ahead signal. Gota would renounce US citizenshop at the appropriate juncture if given the green light to be candidate.??
According to knowledgeable circles all that Gotabaya Rajapaksa has to do is to make an unequivocal, unambiguous declaration that he is renouncing US Citizenship at the US embassy in Colombo. Thereafter his US citizenship will be revoked and will lose dual citizenship. The process is expected to be over in a matter of few weeks. In the case of Geetha Kumarasinghe the blunder she reportedly made was in assuming incorrectly that communicating with Swiss authorities by letter would be sufficient. Apparently it was not!??
?
Gota?s Dilemma Like Shakespeare?s Hamlet
Gotabaya appearing to be somewhat hesitant to enter the presidential election fray is perceived by some detractors to be a political drama. They think he is feigning reluctance and that he is very eager for power. Others however say that the wavering is not political pretence and that Gota was indeed placed in an agonizing dilemma like Shakespeare?s Hamlet. He did not like electoral politics and he did yearn to spend his twilight years in retirement in the USA with his only son. However, they say that the indecisiveness is now over and that Gota has now resolved to throw his hat into the ring.??
A number of inquiries are being conducted and cases have been filed in courts against Gotabaya and other members of the Rajapaksa family over many alleged offences. Gota himself has obtained court orders staying his possible arrest over some of these matters. He has consistently proclaimed his innocence in these cases and accused the present government of conducting a political vendetta against him. The constant attempts by the Sirisena-Wickremesinghe regime to pursue - what is perceived by Gota to be - a witch hunt against him and the Rajapaksas has compelled him to lock horns in political combat. Gota has resolved to answer the Hamlet-like dilemma in his own way. Gota does not want to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune and instead wants to end them by opposing. Besides he also believes that the country is at peril and needs him.??
For all these reasons Gotabaya Rajapaksa seems to have indicated his willingness and readiness to contest the next Presidential elections. Gota is projected as a leader for change on a political mission with an economic vision. Although he is trying to project an image of being an economics oriented man with a mission above race and religion, it is doubtful whether the extremist ethno-religious elements who have been supportive of him in the past would ever let him follow that course. It remains to be seen whether Gota could break free of these bonds even if he wants to do so.? ?
?
Diversity Or Mono-Ethnic Majoritarianism
An immediate question that arises is whether a Gotabaya candidacy could attract votes from the ethnic and religious minority communities of this country by embracing diversity or whether it would pander only to mono-ethnic majoritarianism. There is also the larger question as to whether economic upliftment and renaissance alone could bring about understanding, amity and reconciliation among the diverse sections that make up the plural society of Sri Lanka. These and other related matters would be delved into deeply in a forthcoming article.

Housemaids injected with contraceptives: Minister orders probe
	
An immediate inquiry will be conducted into reports about the administration of injectable- contraceptives to Sri Lankan housemaids, Foreign Employment Minister Harin Fernando told Daily Mirror yesterday.
He directed the Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment (SLBFE) to launch an independent inquiry in the wake of an expose? published by Daily Mirror on Thursday on injecting the contraceptive Depo-Provera to Sri Lankan housemaids before they are sent for employment to the Gulf countries.
" It was when I saw the article that I came to know about the contraceptive injected to the Sri Lankan housemaids. As of now, it is still only speculation," the minister said.
He said the formal inquiry would unearth more information about this matter and if the ?speculation? is found to be true, necessary action would be taken against those responsible.
By way of an investigation which included the interviewing of housemaids, travel agents, medical staffers and other related persons, the DM carried a report titled ?Passport to the murky world of contraceptives? revealing the hidden practice of administrating injectable contraceptives to housemaids leaving Sri Lanka.

JVP hits back at Rajitha
	
JVP MP Vijitha Herath yesterday rejected the statement made by Minister Rajitha Senaratne where he compared the the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) with the LTTE and said it was surprising for the minister, who had led a terrorist outfit known as ?Pra? to make such a statement.
He told Daily Mirror the JVP was a political party that had stood for peoples? rights, their day-to-day issues and for justice.
?The JVP was banned in 1981 based on false allegations against us. But we have done our politics together with the people since 1970. We were suppressed by those who could not tolerate our rise in popularity,? the MP said.
He said there were terrorists outfits such as ?Kalu Koti, Ukussa and Pra? those days, which acted as an unofficial arm of the army.
"Pra" was one such outfit funded by the then government and arms were provided to it by the government. Mr. Senaratne was a person who operated that outfit. It is surprising that he is pointing fingers at us,? the MP said.
He said the LTTE could not be compared with the JVP, because the LTTE was not an organization that worked for the rights of the people.
The MP said Minister Senaratne who was also a Cabinet spokesman was disgracing the government by making such baseless statements. (Ajith Siriwardana)

Land swindle in Knuckles: Ministry sends audit team to inspect site
	
Public Enterprise and Kandy City Development Ministry will send an audit team next week to inquire into the allegation that 21,000 acres of land in the Knuckles Mountain has been given to close associates of some government ministers for various projects.
Ministry Secretary Ravindra Hewavitharana told Daily Mirror the Ministry would send the audit team for a site inspection to ascertain the truth of these reports.
?However, officials of Elkaduwa Plantation Limited have rejected these claims, which could be cleared after the investigations are completed,? he added.
Earlier, the Movement for Land and Agriculture Reform (MONLAR) claimed that these lands which were managed by State Plantations Corporation and Elkaduwa Plantation Limited had been given to close associates and relatives of two powerful ministers.
MONLAR member and environmentalist Sajeewa Chamikara told Daily Mirror that 6,192 of the 9,675 hectares belonged to State Plantations Corporation and 2,363 of the 3,693 hectares belonged to Elkaduwa Plantation Limited from the lands attached to the boundary of Knuckles Conservation Forest - a total of 21,400 acres had been given accordingly.
He said the Ministry had requested them to provide documentary evidence with regard to this matter to proceed with the investigations, ?We have given all the details to the ministry and are awaiting a positive response from the authorities concerned,? Mr. Chamikara said. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)

More than 100 believed dead in Cuba plane crash
	
More than 100 people are believed dead Friday after a Cubana de Aviacion Boeing 737-200 crashed on takeoff from Havana's Jose Marti International Airport, according to Cuba's state-run media.
Three female passengers were in critical condition after surviving the crash into thick vegetation just miles from the runway, the state-run newspaper Granma reported.
Flight DMJ 0972, with at least 104 people on board, was headed to the eastern Cuban city of Holguin when it plummeted into in an agricultural area in the Santiago de las Vegas neighborhood at 12:08 p.m., according to Granma. A state radio broadcaster said there were 105 passengers -- 100 Cuban and five foreigners.
Orestes Bentancour, who lives near the crash site, told CNN that he was drawn out of his home by the "enormous noise" the plane made on takeoff. He said the plane appeared to swerve to one side and revved its engines before crashing.
Five crew members on board were Mexican nationals, according to Mexico's Civil Aviation Authority. Global Airline, which operated the flight, said there were six crew members, all Mexican nationals.
The nearly 30-year-old Boeing 737-200 was owned by the Mexican airline Damojh and leased to Cubana de Aviacion, the Civil Aviation Authority said in a statement. The charter flight "suffered a failure" and crashed about six miles from the airport.
Search and rescue personnel descended on the area -- with some residents helping -- as firefighters tried to extinguish the flames, according to photos and video from the scene.
The Granma report included a photo from an airport terminal of a towering plume of black smoke rising in the distance.
A large fireball followed by a plume of smoke was visible near the airport on the outskirts of Havana, according to witnesses.
Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel was at the scene of the accident, the newspaper reported.
Diaz-Canel later offered his condolences to the victims' families and told reporters the cause of the crash was under investigation.
The fire at the crash site had been extinguished and no one on the ground was injured, he said.
Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto offered his condolences via Twitter.
Boeing issued a statement of condolence and said, "A Boeing technical team stands ready to assist as permitted under US law and at the direction of the US National Transportation Safety Board and Cuban authorities."
Holguin is about 435 miles east of the Cuban capital. Cuban state media originally reported the flight was bound for Guyana.
Cubana de Aviacion -- the national carrier -- has had to ground some of its aging fleet because of safety issues, though the cause of Friday's crash is unknown.(CNN)

North Korea summit:  Trump contradicts Bolton on ?Libya model?
	
?
President Donald Trump on Thursday reassured North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un that he would remain in power under a nuclear deal with the United States, emphasizing that his administration is not seeking regime change amid threats from Pyongyang to cancel a historic summit next month.??
In impromptu remarks at the White House, Trump sharply contradicted national security adviser John Bolton, who had said the administration would ask North Korea to emulate the ?Libya model? from 2003 in which the Moammar Gaddafi regime fully relinquished its nascent nuclear weapons program.??
A top Kim aide blasted Bolton this week, blaming the Libya deal for Gaddafi?s eventual downfall in an internationally backed popular uprising in 2011.??
?The Libya model isn?t the model that we have at all when we?re thinking of North Korea,? Trump said. ?In Libya, we decimated that country.???
By contrast, Trump added, a deal with North Korea ?would be with Kim Jong Un, something where he?d be there, he?d be in his country, he?d be running his country, his country would be very rich, his country would be very industrious.???
?Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who has met with Kim twice in Pyongyang over the past two months, has reportedly told him directly that the United States is not seeking his removal from power.??
But Trump?s remarks represented a remarkable public guarantee aimed at trying to assuage the North Koreans and ensure they would not back out of the summit, which is scheduled for June 12 in Singapore.??

PAYE tax owed by CEB employees recovered from consumers: CaFFE
	
Electrical engineers and senior staff of the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) have neglected to pay the Pay As You Earn (PAYE) tax owed to the government amounting to Rs.3465 million since 2010 and we as customers have been paying for their sins, Campaign for Free and Fair Elections (CaFFE) Executive Director Keerthi Tennakoon charged.
He said employees with an income of over Rs.100, 000 are liable to pay PAYE tax as stipulated in the Circular of Inland Revenue No's. 1706/18 of May 20, 2001.
?In the annual report of the CEB in 2015, the the amount of PAYE tax to be paid since 2010 was Rs. 2006 mn. Audit reports indicated that it was an illegal payment. CEB officers have repeatedly carried out this tax fraud for eight years,? Tennakoon said.
?The PAYE tax that was not paid by electrical engineers and senior staff of the CEB from 2010 to 2015 had been recovered from the consumers,? Tennakoon stressed.
He said although the Auditor General had pointed out that electrical engineers and senior staff of the CEB had evaded the PAYE tax, no action had been taken against them as yet. (Sheain Fernandopulle)

Quitting 'Yahapalana Govt'--Prez told 16 SLFPers to decide: Dayasiri
	
President Maithripala Sirisena has told the 'rebel' group of 16 former Cabinet, State and Deputy Ministers, who left the government, to decide when the rest of the SLFPers should quit the Yahapalana Government, former Sports Minister and Kurunegala District Parliamentarian Dayasiri Jayasekara said yesterday.
Mr. Jayasekara added that President Sirisena has expressed his desire to see the remaining 23 SLFPers in the unity government leaving it sooner rather than later.
Mr. Jayasekara added that the reorganisation, strengthening of the party from the grass-roots level, recruiting new members and the remaining 23 SLFP members leaving the ?Yahapalana Government? were the strategies discussed at the Central Committee meeting held at the President?s official residence at Mahagamasekara Mawatha on Thursday (17) night.
Addressing the media at the ?Media Centre of Freedom? in Colombo, Mr. Jayasekara said the group of 16 rebel SLPEers had handed over their plan to President Sirisena that explains how the SLFP would campaign as a single political front at all future elections and bring the SLFP to power in 2020 by winning the upcoming Parliamentary and Presidential elections.
?We sent our proposals earlier to President Sirisena in writing and discussed them further last afternoon and he was in complete agreement to our strategy,? Mr. Jayasekara stressed.
Accordingly, it was decided at the CC meeting to subject the SLFP to a complete revamp starting with a new set of office bearers on June 3 at a combined general assembly with the participation of the CC, Executive Committee, Parliamentary Group and All Island Working Committee of the party.

She was a source of support for everybody
	
The certainty of death has taken from us our friend Karin Ramachandra.?
My first meeting with her was when I oversaw the Cathedral Institute. I invited her to teach our students counseling as they walked the journey of priesthood. My second meeting with Karin was under tremendously traumatic circumstances when I was in hospital for six months and she visited me with bottles of homemade fruit juice. This was significant and touched me a lot during a time of immense ordeal.
Karin also used to assist me and my daughter with our own personal issues. She came to our home regularly to meet with us and was a constant source of support for my daughter.?
My final meeting with Karin was when I was a member of the clergy at St. Paul?s Milagiriya. I made it a point to meet with her after service to learn more about her journey from Denmark to Sri Lanka, how she became a Christian, and how she met and married Vinoth. My late wife and I had known Vinoth for over three decades since my days as the Chaplain of the Peradeniya University Chaplaincy. Their marriage was a true testimony of Christian love.??
As a mark of respect to Karin, the monthly meeting of our Inter-Church fellowship was postponed because of her funeral. That spoke volumes about her commitment to ecumenism.
I am sorry to have missed Karin?s funeral. However, my son-in-law and daughter attended the service. Vinoth and all those near and dear to her can be certain of my continued love and concern. May Karin?s soul rest in peace and rise in glory. Amen.

Some can't identify difference between soldiers and terrorists - MS
	
President Maithripala Sirisena said that it is a shame that certain politicians and NGOs have failed to identify the difference between the soldier and the terrorist.
?It is shame that some government and opposition politicians and NGOs which are after money fails to identify the difference between the soldier and the terrorist,? the President said addressing the? National War heroes day ? held near the war heroes monument in parliament grounds today (19).
He invited everybody who respects the great local cultural inheritance and wants to work on behalf the country, the people and the war heroes to work together with him.
President Sirisena said that today such accusations are made by the parties who support the LTTE and living abroad and those who are against the government and security forces.
He also said Sri Lanka?s security forces have not been accused of war crimes in the resolution of the United Nations Human Rights Council as certain media and extremist parties falsely depict.
The brave soldiers who sacrificed their lives will always be hailed by the nation and that the government will always work to give them the highest respect and gratitude they owe and also to look after the well-being of their families, said the President.
President Sirisena said that it is sad to see that certain government media channels have failed to portray the importance of soldiers as well as non-state media do not talk about the programs conducted by the government for the benefit of the soldiers. President asked to work towards reminding the public the great services done by the soldiers to the motherland and to give them the highest dignity they deserve.
President Sirisena admitted that the soldiers should not at all be a political victim and they should not be used to gain political power, to change governments which are in power, or to organize political parties.
President Sirisena further stated that terrorism is now being beaten in the war front, but yet in is not ideologically defeated and that he would not let dreams of the extremists who dream of making a separate Eelam state to become a reality.
President further stated that it is with the collaboration of friendly states that the government made dedicated efforts to defeat this idea of breaking the country in to pieces and that this will be conducted with the help of everyone in the future.
The Annual National War Heroes Commemoration day to celebrate the brave soldiers who fought for a free country was held gloriously.
President Sirisena who offered flowers to the War Heroes Monument honoured the soldiers who sacrificed their lives for the country.

Time for Europe to use the stick against Trump
	
Don?t cry for me, Europe. The time for diminishing Europe?s self-esteem is over. It?s time for toughness and retaliation. Even a personal intervention by his favourite European head of State, Emmanuel Macron, President of France, failed to move President Donald Trump on the gravest of all policies- his decision that the Iran nuclear deal, meant to reduce its nuclear prowess, will be scrapped by the US in favour of a policy of confrontation.? ?
Many observers, in Europe, the Middle East, Russia and China- all signatories to the historic agreement of 2015 -- are worried stiff that this will lead to war between Iran and Israel, in which Trump will feel moved to intercede if Israel is being badly hurt.? ?
?
As for the future, Trumpism looks bleak. He jokes about wanting to rule for life and has threatened to find a way to shut up a good part of the press and to send Hillary Clinton to jail. His ideology seems to be nothing more than whatever Barack Obama was for he?s against.
?
Such a war will not only cause immense damage to Iran it will, unlike when in 1973 Israel fought the combined Arab armies to a standstill well away from its borders, inflict an enormous amount of damage inside Israel. Despite the so-called iron-dome that protects Israel against rockets, enough will get through to cause immense loss of life.? ?
Europe doesn?t want to live cheek by jowl with that kind of inflammable neighbourhood. It doesn?t want to see more chaos, as after the US military intervention in Iraq which helped trigger the civil war in Syria and gave birth to ISIS.? ?
The long-established unity of purpose and liberal, democratic, ideology is being incinerated by the day. Putting America first has meant elbowing aside everyone else on the planet, often in the most unapologetic way. Even the British who since 1941 have usually gone along- the Suez crisis and the Vietnam war excepted- with whatever Washington has decided have got to the stage when they feel they have had enough. The British pro-American consensus is being eroded. Prime Minister Theresa May has been personally insulted by Trump and Britain is 100% committed to the Iranian deal.? ?
As for the future, Trumpism looks bleak. He jokes about wanting to rule for life and has threatened to find a way to shut up a good part of the press and to send Hillary Clinton to jail. His ideology seems to be nothing more than whatever Barack Obama was for he?s against. He?s often a racist. Let?s not even talk about his past subterranean links to Moscow or his sexual liaison with a porn star. Having done these things before he will find a more subtle or more secretive way of doing them again. Worst of all, he plays on the cruder emotions of the less-educated part of the electorate, appealing to their lower values while Obama played to their best. (?When they go low we go high?, as Michelle Obama once said). They ended up voting against their own economic interest.? ?
This is how Trump goes and will go. There is nothing on the horizon to suggest better times in US realpolitik. An agreement with North Korea on nuclear disarmament is impossible now he has demonstrated any deal can be torn up on a whim.? ?
Trump is a twenty-first century ?Hitler type?. Hitler came to power by a democratic vote. Hitler mesmerized the German people. Hitler then bribed them with economic recovery: autobahns, longer holidays, kindergartens, raised pensions and socialized health services. By Hitler?s standard Trump is a higher achiever- he wins his base over not by help for the lower working and middle class but by hip hip hooray nationalism, smashing it to peoples abroad. Hitler re-armed and became threatening abroad much more slowly than Trump has.? ?
Europe must stop being shy. It should look at itself and realize it is a super power and a finer one than the US. It may not be militarily in the same class as the US, but that is a good thing. In its schools, access to the best of the universities for all, free or cheap health services, honesty of elections, design of its parliaments and power structures it is far ahead.??
?
The quality of the majority of its newspapers, radio and television is much higher. Crime and murders are much less. Its arts are more developed- in classical music, ballet, art, architecture, literature, film, (Hollywood blockbusters aside), theatre, museums, and art galleries. Just count the number of opera houses, symphony orchestras, theatres and publishers across the continent. And don?t forget the Beatles.? ?
This is without including Russia which, in the round, is arguably the most cultured country in the world.? ?
Of course, the US has a lot of these but counted per head of population it is far behind.? ?Perhaps the carrot of a better society and way of doing things will never be attractive to Trump. The time has come for Europe to be tough, to stand up for its interests and give Trump the stick. How to do this is what Europe now has to work out.? ?

We will cherish the memories of you
	
You may wonder why it has taken me so long to write to you. Well, for me, you are still around and will be because you left behind so many visible memories. Each time I see a vintage or classic car on the road, I imagine you sitting at the wheel, elegantly dressed, relaxed, cool, everything under control, and then I think I would see you any moment. Tears come to my eyes.
We would meet once a month for lunch. We had our first and our last lunch at the ?Italian Riviera? in Colombo. We would always picture sports cars from Italy, Germany and England driving up to the porch. Not only did you know the details of these cars, you had also been to the factories and test driven some of them. The Mille Miglia road race, Brescia-Rome-Brescia, was our dream. We wanted to do it in your Alfa. In the meantime you would have met your favorite Mille Miglia driver, Juan Manuel Fangio, a gentleman driver, with magnetism, debonair charm and physical presence. Actually, that is what you had; in a crowded room, your presence was always felt.
When I first saw you, it was not so much the Rolls-Royce, but your Johnny Weissmuller frame that caught my attention. Never mind the fact that a mutual friend of ours told me later that you can?t swim. You not only had a golden hand with cars, you also, and more importantly, had a golden hand with your wife and best friend, Shanthi, a swimming champion. A really close friend (five, maximum ten in a lifetime) is somebody you would like to spend the rest of your life with. Somebody you could just sit with in conversation or in silence, enjoying each other?s company. You are one of my five friends and I may be one of your ten friends. Unfortunately, we had not even ten years to share.
Collecting vintage and classic cars is like the work of an archaeologist. The older the artifacts, the more interested he becomes in them. How lucky we would have been to grow old together with you! You would have become more and more interested in us. Why could you not be with your family and friends a few more years? Like your father who lived up to the age of 100!?
Dear King Freddie, you would call me Chevalier. I will miss hearing that. But whenever we sing ?My way? or ?Hello Dolly?, your presence will be felt. And we will cherish the memories of you. And we believe in what the Bible teaches us about synchronicity, spiritual appearances and presence. This is our consolation. But we remain immensely saddened by your physical absence.
Your friend

What it would be without bees
	
Many people especially those not too concerned about environmental issues and the vital need to maintain bio-diversity may be surprised that tomorrow is World Bee Day. But the United Nations itself has declared this day on its calendar on the basis that bees and other pollinators, such as butterflies, bats and hummingbirds, are increasingly under threat from selfish human activities.??
According to the UN, which is playing a vital role in the battle against climate change, destruction of the bio-diversity or eco-balance; pollinators allow many plants, including many food crops, to reproduce. Not only do pollinators contribute directly to food security, but they are key to conserving biodiversity -- a cornerstone of the Sustainable Development Goals. They also serve as sentinels for emergent environmental risks, signalling the health of local ecosystems. Thus we see the importance of World Bee Day and know that we need to think beyond the nursery rhymes like ?one two three, bumble bee...???
Invasive insects, pesticides, land-use change and mono-cropping practices may reduce available nutrients and pose threats to bee colonies. To raise awareness of the importance of pollinators, the threats they face and their contribution to sustainable development, the UN designated May 20 as World Bee Day.??
You may ask why this day? May 20 coincides with the birthday of Anton Jan?a, who in the 18th century pioneered modern beekeeping techniques in his native Slovenia and praised the bees for their ability to work so hard, while needing so little attention.??
The UN Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) portrays a graphic picture of the world?s different pollinators, species such as butterflies, birds and bats. The most popular are bees and it is estimated that there are between 25,000 and 30,000 species. We could ask why we need to care about pollinators if we were eco-friendly and responsible citizens instead of just being carried away by the false and impermanent values of a selfish and wicked world.??
We need to know that globally some 90 per cent of wild flowering plants depend on animal pollination for producing their seed. Therefore pollinators are responsible for 35 per cent of the world?s crop production. So this shows that caring for bees and other pollinators is part of the fight against world hunger. According to the FAO?s latest report some 124 million people in 51 countries experienced high levels of food insecurity last year -- 11 million more people than the year before. According to the latest edition of the Global Report on the Food Crises, hunger is so severe it poses an immediate threat to lives or livelihoods.??
The increase is largely attributable to new or intensified conflict and insecurity in Myanmar, north-east Nigeria, the Democratic Republic of Congo, South Sudan and Yemen. Prolonged drought conditions also resulted in consecutive poor harvests in countries already facing high levels of food insecurity and malnutrition in eastern and southern Africa.??
That is why the FAO says ensuring biodiversity among these species is crucial to build resilience in agro-ecosystems and adapt to climate change.??
In Sri Lanka we regularly hear of attacks by bees but according to Bandara Thambavita, Secretary of the Kandy-based Bee-Protection Organization, last year a bee disease had hit Colombo and Gampaha.? ?
Mr. Thambavita said ?Apis cerana indica? or the Indian honey bee is the honey bee mainly found in Sri Lanka. It is generally considered a robust species, quite resistant to diseases compared to the ?Apis mellifera?, its Western cousin.??
He told the media most of the diseases bees contracted up until recently could be controlled by natural methods alone. But, soon the organisation found this was a different disease as it was not responding to any of the conventional methods.? ?
According to Dr. Ashoka Dangolla, professor in veterinary clinical science at the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine and Animal Science in the University of Peradeniya, this ailment may be a viral brood disease. He believes that when we bring more bees? honey from outside we are likely to face such a disease. People seem to be catching up (producing) bees? honey as a business very well. There is a lot of money in it, he adds.??
Now that we know the importance of bees and other pollinators let us act to protect them, ourselves and Planet Earth. Que sera sera what would it be without bees.? ?
