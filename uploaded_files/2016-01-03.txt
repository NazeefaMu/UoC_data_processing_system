Dinesh: Unitary State, place of Buddhism omitted in new proposals
	
The government had omitted certain significant Articles of the 1978 Constitution, including those on upholding the Unitary State of the country and giving foremost place to Buddhism from the new Constitution, Mahajana Eksath Peramuna (MEP) MP Dinesh Gunawardane charged today.
Speaking at a media briefing MP Gunawardane said the people were not informed about the omission of two Articles, which mainly affect the country.
He charged that the government?s intention was to obtain approval of the people through a referendum only for two issues - to abolition of the Executive Presidency and replacement of the Proportional Representation System with the First Past the Post System.
He claimed that the clauses about the Unitary State and place of Buddhism had not been mentioned in the document submitted to MPs with regard to the proposals to be presented to Parliament on January 9.
He said he suspected whether the changes were a result of the proposals presented by the Tamil National Alliance, and the Muslim Congress.
?Even though the first anniversary of the government is falling on January 9, pledges made by the government to the people have not yet been fulfilled. The so-called good-governance and economic development are not established in the country. Meanwhile, the country is being going to another dangerous situation. If these proposals are made laws, eventually the country will be divided into two. The government should carefully work on the proposals which affect the country without being relied on political parties. We should stand against this dangerous situation irrespective of caste and religion,? MEP Leader said.
He said before major changes regarding the Unitary State or the place of Buddhism are made in the proposed new Constitution, people should be consulted at a referendum.
Speaking on the abolishing of Executive Presidency, he said even if the Executive Presidency should be abolished, certain powers which decide on the national security should remain as they are needed to make strong decisions on issues pertaining to national security. (Piyumi Fonseka)

Environmentalists oppose bridge over Kandy Lake
	
Environmentalists in Kandy have opposed the proposal of the Minister of Highways and Higher Education Lakshman Kiriella to build a bridge over the Kandy Lake citing Kandy Lake is sacred and should not be touched.
Attorney Shantha Ratnayake - Chairman of the Lawyers of Environmentalists Forum said that if a bridge is built over the Kandy Lake the entire landscape would be obliterated and the vision of an aesthetic King who beautified Kandy with the Lake and Pathiruppuwa would be lost.
He said that this move is not in keeping with the inspirations of the Kandy people.
?The only remaining beauty of Kandy is the Sri Dalada Maligawa and the Kandy Lake. If this is lost, we are keeping nothing for our children,? he said. (L.B. Senaratne)Related :?Bridge over Kandy Lake to ease traffic: Kiriella

It was a mere request to Army to repair drains: Wigneswaran
	
Allaying misgivings about a request he had made to the army, Northern Province Chief Minister C.V.Wigneswaran said, he had merely requested the army to look into the possibility of repairing the drainage system in Jaffna, as it was the army that had filled the drains with earth during the war to prevent the LTTE from planting claymore mines in them.
He regretted that some people had twisted his request. (Romesh Madushanka)

Over 100,000 Lankan still living as refugees in India
	
	More than six-and-a-half years after the civil war between the Sri Lankan government and the rebel Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) ended, over 1.22 lakh people from the neighbouring island continue to live as refugees in other countries, while another 50,000 people are internally-displaced, according to the latest figures from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).
	A total of 1,22,533 persons from Sri Lanka are living as refugees in other countries and 15,504 persons (pending cases) have sought asylum there. A total of 50,268 have been internally displaced within the country, the Mid-Year Trends 2015 released by UNHCR recently stated.
	While 231 refugees returned to the island in the first half of last year, none of those who had been internally-displaced went back to their original home during that period.
	Though there are conflicting versions about the number of persons killed in the war, according to an estimate of the United Nations about 40,000 persons have been killed. S.C. Chandrahasan, Treasurer of Organisation for Eelam Refugees Rehabilitation (OfERR) said, ?The government of India should come with a generous package to supplement the efforts of the Sri Lankan government in facilitating the return of the refugees.?
	Referring to the recent developments in the island, including the release of over 700 acres of civil land so far under the control of the Army to the civilian authorities, Mr. Chandrahasan said this was the right time to encourage more refugees to return as most of the land owners are living in camps in India.

## Title: SL 'blacklists' top Maldives diplomat, MP

SL 'blacklists' top Maldives diplomat, MP
	
	Immigration authorities of Sri Lanka confiscated the passports of two high ranking Maldivian officials last month after they were blacklisted "by mistake," it has emerged.
	Haveeru understands that the passports of foreign minister Dhunya Maumoon and her brother Faris Maumoon, who is a parliamentarian, were confiscated after they travelled to Sri Lanka on an unofficial visit. They were reportedly held at the airport for more than an hour before being told that they had been blacklisted ?by mistake?.
	Dhunya and Faris -- children of former president Maumoon Abdul Gayoom -- was in Sri Lanka to visit a relative admitted at a Sri Lankan hospital. Their father and other family members had separately gone to Sri Lanka to visit their relative receiving treatment, but they did not face any obstacles.
	On his visit, Gayoom met Sri Lankan President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, while Dhunya separately met with the prime minister.
	The incident followed the arrest of three people over a recent assassination plot on the president that involved a sniper brought into Maldives from Sri Lanka.
	Confirming the arrest of the Sri Lankan sniper for the first time, police said in a statement in November that the 27-year-old man was arrested on October 24. He has been remanded by the Criminal Court.
	Reports of the Sri Lankan sniper?s arrest came a day after Maldivian security forces confiscated assault rifles and hand guns in what has been the biggest weapons bust in the country?s history. The weapons had been seized from Hibilhadhoo island in Baa Atoll being developed as a resort.
	The army had confirmed that two assault rifles found in the weapons bust belonged to the state armoury.
	The items showcased during a press conference included several hand guns, a T56 assault rifle and a MP5 sub-machine gun. In addition, a large quantity of bomb making material were also displayed at the press briefing.
	Maldives declared a month-long state of emergency in November after the discovery of a bomb near the presidential palace. The state of emergency was, however, later cut short after a week.
	Maldives military had confirmed that the suspected device found in a vehicle parked near the presidential residence of Muliaage in capital Male was an improvised explosive device which had been subsequently been diffused.
	The discovery of the IED came just over a month after an explosion aboard the presidential speedboat carrying President Abdulla Yameen Abdul Gayoom now confirmed as an attempt to kill the president.
	President Yameen was unhurt but his spouse and two others were hurt in the explosion.
	The primary suspect in the blast appears to be former Vice President Ahmed Adheeb Abdul Ghafoor who was arrested on October 24 as soon as he arrived from an official trip to China.
	He is accused of high treason, a charge he denies.
	The Sri Lankan sniper?s arrest affected the relations between the Maldives and Sri Lanka, which accused the Maldives of using historically warm bilateral ties to crackdown on Maldivian political and social media activists.
	In a statement, Sri Lanka?s external affairs ministry had said Sri Lanka is deeply concerned about recent developments in the Maldives and events that have impacted on Sri Lanka, including the arrest of two Sri Lankan nationals in the Maldives and the questionable removal of a Maldivian social media activist who was in possession of a valid Sri Lankan visa. It is deeply disturbing that Sri Lanka, a country which has always maintained the closest friendly relations with the Maldives, is being used to initiate questionable action against political and social media activists, it added.
	The condemnation by Sri Lanka came a day after it summoned the Maldives top representative in the country over the arrest and subsequent repatriation of a suspect wanted in connection to the recent blast on the presidential speedboat.
	Ahmed Ashraf, known by his social media moniker of Shumba Gong, is a self-declared supporter of the embattled former vice president Adheeb.
	Sri Lankan authorities arrested him on November 1 on the request of their Maldivian counterparts.
	Ashraf was brought to Male the following morning. He was taken to the police detention centre in the island of Dhoonidhoo in Kaafu Atoll.
	Following those developments, Sri Lankan authorities began heavily screeningthe luggage of Maldivians travelling to its capital Colombo. The extra security checks had been conducted as Maldivians were suspected of bringing in goods for trade as baggage without the necessary clearance.
	The special security checks came after the murder of a Maldivian in Sri Lanka in November.
	Razeen, who is a notorious former gangster, was found dead with stab injuries in an abandoned paddy field near the Tumbovila Bridge in Piliyandala on November 5. Two suspects -- a Maldivian and his Sri Lankan accomplice -- have been taken into custody.
	Sri Lankan authorities had said the thousands of Maldivians residing in Sri Lanka would be subject to closer scrutiny following the killing.(Haveeru Online)
