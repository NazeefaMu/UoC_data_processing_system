Embilipitiya Case: Probe in favour of Police, says Udul
	
The prosecution had conducted investigations and the inquiry in a manner favourable to the Police in the Embilipitiya death case, said Attorney-at-law Udul Premaratne today.
?As the aggrieved party, we wish to draw the Court's attention to the fact that, since the case concerning the death of Sumith Prasanna Jayawardena (who died during an altercation with the police at a party in Embilipitiya) was against the police, the prosecution had conducted the investigation and the inquiry in a manner that favoured the police,? he said.
?By doing that the police were trying to release the police suspects,? he said.
?The Judicial Medical Officer?s report confirmed that injuries and severe internal bleeding combined with shock caused of death -- following a clash with a police team.
?Two months have gone by and only one suspect has been arrested so far. The police officers, who were involved in the case, are still on active service and threatening the witnesses.
?We will hand over a report to the Embilipitiya Magistrate?s Court, through the Attorney General?s Department, on the way the investigation had been conducted and the wrongdoings of the police,? he said.
Sumith Prasanna's body was exhumed on Tuesday (15) morning for a second autopsy before Embilipitiya Additional Magistrate Prasanna Fernando. (Chaturanga Pradeep)

Govt. may try to purchase power: Pavithra
	
Former Power and Energy Minister Pavithra Wanniarachchi today said it was uncertain whether the island-wide power cuts were simply a result of the Government?s inefficiency or it was mulling to purchase electricity from the power stations belonging to the private sector, for exorbitant prices making the power cuts an excuse.
?Our government amended the Power and Energy Act to make sure that electricity would be purchased from private sector only through open tenders. Today, it seems the Government is mulling to amend the Act probably with the intention of purchasing electricity from the private sector for exorbitant prices,? she charged.
Addressing a news conference organised by the Joint Opposition at the Dr. N. M. Perera Centre in Borella, the MP said both the Cabinet and the Government had failed to provide the required guidance and assistance to Power and Energy Ministry and Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) officials.
?Deploying military personnel to guard power stations won?t stop power failures. This is not the first instance where a transformer exploded or a cable was broken in the history of the power supply in Sri Lanka. In our time too transformers exploded but we were efficient enough to prevent island-wide power failures,? MP Wanniarachchi said.
She said there were ?protectors? in the power grid and these protectors could make sure that a failure in a specific location of the grid won?t affect the entire power supply of the country. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

GSP+: EU advises SL to be patient
	
The European Union (EU) delegation to Sri Lanka on Tuesday said that it was advisable for the Government of Sri Lanka (GoSL) to be patient with the application for GSP+ until there is a strong chance of regaining the tariff facility from the EU.
Paul Godfrey, the Charg? d' affaires of the EU delegation to Sri Lanka and the Maldives said the process of regaining the concession was rather condition-based instead of time-based.
?This is why we are advising them (GoSL) to wait with the application for GSP+ until the conditions are ready so the EU can annul the revoke of GSP+, we want to be confident. Normally it takes about eight months to the process of granting the access, assuming the access will be granted. Neither the EU nor the GoSL want the application to be rejected,? he said soon after the inauguration of the new premises in Colombo.
Mr. Godfrey said there need to be clear evidence to ensure that progressive measures have been taken to improve human rights and to achieve an irrevocable status to regain the concession.
Meanwhile, he said the GoSL had achieved a remarkable progress in reconciliation since coming into power 15 months ago and said would like to see further progress as well.
He further said they stand by the stance of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra?ad Zeid Al-Hussein on Sri Lanka, which he made saying the country has done well in improving reconciliation.
The premises of the EU delegation was ceremoniously inaugurated by visiting European Commissioner for International Cooperation and Development Neven Mimica and Foreign Affairs Minister Mangala Samaraweera.
EU Grants ?38 million for development projects 
After the inauguration, Commissioner Mimica announced the signing of two new support programmes between the European Commission and Sri Lanka worth ?38 million in the field of rural development and trade in the country.
From the total grants, ?30 million will go to the programme 'Integrated Rural Development in the Most Vulnerable Districts of the Central and Uva Provinces' while ?8 million will go towards trade related assistance to help Sri Lanka to develop policies and improve market access, competitiveness and compliance with international standards.
?The new programme aims to support the country in its transition to becoming an upper middle income country,? the EU said.
During his visit, Commissioner Mimica was scheduled to meet Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, Foreign Affairs Minister Mangala Samaraweera and other senior members of the Government. He will also meet with civil society representatives, including those working on women's empowerment, child rights, disappeared people and media freedom.
Commissioner Mimca met with Foreign Affairs Minister Samaraweera on Tuesday itself and had discussed a wide range of issues including possible lifting of Illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing ban and restoration of GSP+. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Later it was rumoured that he was getting ready to vie for the chair of the most important local body in the Western province. However, observers say that disappointment is in store for this ambitious one unless he contests for the post on the Green party ticket.?
This politico, a very articulate one on key national issues, had his eye on several high positions under yahapalanaya, but luck had not favoured him. Sources say he has got more political enemies than allies arrayed against him in his own camp.
The incumbent of this high office is not likely to receive party nomination again at the polls round the coroner and the Green party authorities may announce their candidate for it only after the polls are announced, they say. ?

Meanwhile, reports say that the government is seriously considering three names.?
By the way, a certain hopeful approached an astrologer cum occult practitioner in the Kaduwela area to ascertain whether he stood a chance of getting the coveted post. The astrologer who did a light-reading and a ?Nimitta? calculation came out with the vague prediction that the most qualified of the main three aspirants would be selected for the post. The aspirant then asked the astrologer to give the name of the most qualified person who was due to be selected for the appointment.
The astrologer in response gave the aspirant a betel leaf and asked him to guess the name of the person whom he thought would get the post and come back in five minutes.
The aspirant guessed a name and returned. Then the astrologer went into a ?fit? and said: ?You guessed right. The person you guessed is going to get the post!?
On hearing the astrologer?s prediction, the aspirant?s face turned ash grey.?
It was a highly dejected aspirant that had come out of the astrologer?s light-reading cell, they say.
While on his way home, he confided in his companion that he guessed another aspirant?s name hoping it would prove wrong and the prediction only confirmed his fear that the latter would be finally selected for the post. ?Nevertheless, he did not reveal who he had guessed would get the post.?

The Wild Life Conservation Department and the Army today chased out a herd of deer numbering fifteen at the Mattala Rajapaksa International Airport (MRIA) runways, a Wildlife sanctuary office of Hambantota.
However, sources said that nearly 100 deer were seen within the air port premises even on the runway on a regular basis.
Speaking to the Daily Mirror, Range Forest Officer of the Sanctuary Office of Hambantota Vijaya Kumara said the herd of deer numbering 15 had came to the runaway yesterday and they had taken steps to chase away the herd, though the they used to roam the airport premises for a long time.
?We suppose that this herd of deer used to stay in the airport premises, since the period of airport constructions. Perhaps this herd gets fenced in here, while building the mesh fence around the airport premises,? Mr. Kumara said.
He said the number of deer in this herd had increased within around three years and now it had become a large herd of 100.
When the Daily Mirror tried to contact the Duty Officer of the airport, the officials said he was busy with a meeting for the third anniversary preparations of the airport, which falls on March 18. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)

The finance company has entered this market with the dual objective of serving the micro leasing requirements of its existing customers and attracting new customers who are on the lookout for standard leasing options. This marks a strategic initiative?
to penetrate into its target market, which had hitherto?
catered exclusively to the microfinance segment.
Chaminda Prabhath ? Managing Director/CEO of HNB Grameen, commenting about the future plans for leasing said: ?The introduction of leasing facilities is yet another big step in our journey towards becoming a fully-fledged finance company, which caters to the financial needs of all Sri Lankans.

For the convenience of our customers around Sri Lanka, these facilities will be made available at all our branches islandwide over the next few months.?
R.M.P. Dayawansa, HNB Grameen Deputy General Manager, SME and Leasing commenting on features of the leasing product stated as follows: ?Our leasing facilities will cover personal and commercial vehicles, motorcycles, three-wheelers, machinery and factory equipment.

UNHRC work in SL help addressing rights issues: Moon
	
The works of the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) in countries like Sri Lanka had helped the International Community to address Human Rights issues and work towards accountability, UN General Secretary Ban Ki-Moon has said.
He was addressing an event organised by the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) on the United Nations Human Rights Council?s 10th Anniversary on Tuesday.
?The Council's work on Burundi, Guinea, South Sudan, Sri Lanka and Syria has helped the international community to respond to human rights emergencies and work towards accountability,? he said.
Commenting on the Syrian conflict in particular, he said the people of that country had endured horrific and widespread Human Rights abuses, including extrajudicial executions and torture, and repeated his call to the Security Council to refer the situation in Syria to the International Criminal Court.
He said Human Rights were, sadly, ?under attack? worldwide and the UNHRC must increase its impact on the ground over its second decade.
?Ten years on, I commend the Council on making important progress towards putting the Human Rights pillar back at the centre of the United Nations system,? the UN chief said.
He said an important task for the Council was to reinforce the links between Human Rights, peace and security, and development.
?While member States have the primary responsibility for upholding rights, the member States that are all too often in breach of their commitments,? he said urging the Human Rights Council to more than ever pursue its work with courage. (LP)

Will he get a dressing down?
	
?
A powerful purohita in yahapalanaya on an official visit to a country considered a leading world power made a speech that made headlines in the world Press.
?
The purohita in the course of his speech explained his government?s take on several national issues with international ramifications. However, it transpired that certain things he said ran counter to what a very high authority in yahapalanaya had earlier said while outlining the policy matters of his government. This had led to international media pointing out that comments the purohita had made contradicted the official stand of the government on related matters.?
?
Later several big guns in the government had brought to the notice of the highest authority of the gaffe that the purohita had made during his much publicized speech abroad.?
The purohita is due to get a dressing down soon for the embarrassment caused to the yahapalanaya, they say.?
