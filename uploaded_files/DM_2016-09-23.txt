18 Lankans in India bailed over human trafficking
	
Eighteen Sri Lankans, arrested in June in Kanyakumari District on the charge of embarking on an "illegal" voyage to Australia, were granted interim bail by the Madras High Court bench in Madurai on Thursday.
According to One India, granting the relief, Justice CT Selvam had directed the suspects to stay at the Special Refugee Camp in Tiruchirappalli.
The 18 were arrested on June 26 by the Q Branch police under various statutes, including the Foreigners Act, the Passport Act and IPC sections 370 (trafficking of persons), 120B (criminal conspiracy) and 420 (cheating).
They were charged with attempting to flee to Australia with the help of some refugees, including one Balaji. The petitioners, including Gopinath, had submitted that they had come to Tamil Nadu from Sri Lanka as pilgrims and not refugees as alleged by the police.
They had valid passports and visa. But, the police arrested them alleging that they were refugees involved in human trafficking and produced them before a court which had remanded them to judicial custody.
Their bail applications were dismissed by the Sessions Court at Nagercoil in Kanyakumari district. The petitioners had sought bail on the ground that they were sole the bread-winners of their respective families.

Mothers attire no longer an issue: Minister
	
Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam said today said that as long as the mothers attire is appropriate, she can enter into the school when dropping off or picking up her children.
He said the Ministry had already issued a circular informing Zonal Education Directors and Principals in this regard.
He said the decision was made after considering the requests received by mothers who are bringing in their children on their way to work. Most of the parents visit schools for parent-teacher meetings from their places of work, he said.
There were reports that many mothers had to leave their children at the school gates because of their attire. Parents usually drop off their children on their way to work and most of the women no longer wear sarees to work. Parents cant leave their children at gates. Therefore, any mother who brings in her children wearing appropriate attire can enter the school, the minister told addressing an event held in Vijayaba National School in Mahawa.

PM optimistic more Lankan experts will return
	
A number of Sri Lankan experts, including academics and professionals, who left the country had returned recently and more experts would hopefully follow them in the near future, said Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe yesterday.
Addressing a ceremony held to launch the construction of the Techno City at Mahahena in Homagama, the Premier said he had invited Sri Lankan experts to return, not alone, but with their colleagues.
We should utilise human resources to the utmost. Today, the US knows that China has the biggest GDP for a country. That is why the US is recruiting people with expertise to face this growing threat. We, too, should fortify ourselves with knowledge by retaining local experts in the country, he said.
He went on to note that the pace of development of a country depends on its development in the field of science and technology -- and that Techno City would become a centre in the endeavour to strengthen Sri Lanka's citizens with knowledge.
This move, without a doubt, will become one of the milestones in the political and economic history of Sri Lanka. Science and technology should not be limited to one stream of subjects, all should acquire a knowledge of science, he said.
Techno City was launched under the first phase of the Megapolis Development Plan by the Megapolis and Western Development Ministry.
The Prime Minister launched the project on the invitation of Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka and in the presence of Science, Technology and Research Minister Susil Premajayantha.
At the launch, the premier declared open SLINTEC, the Technology Incubation Centre. Foundation stones were laid to construct a National Science Centre and a Satellite Centre in the city. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

By Supun Dias
Sanasa Development Bank PLC unveiled its new logo as the bank is on the path of restructuring its image and operations in order to provide a wider range of services to the public where the bank would be better known as SDB Bank going forward.
The main reason for the introduction of the new logo was due to the listing of its shares on the Colombo Stock Exchange. Now it has joined hands with the International Finance Corporation (IFC), which is the private sector arm of the World Bank as well.
The SDB Bank can be identified as a bank which introduced a new dimension to the countrys banking sector by providing loan facilities to the poor and rural communities. This has provided a lifeline for thousands of people to achieve economic prosperity throughout the last 19 years.
SDB Bank Chairperson Samadani Kiriwandeniya said that new changes were introduced with a view to carrying forward our mission in a more orderly manner.
The new name will be easy to remember and this step will cement our place in the market because we have a competition now, she said.
She went on to say that when the Sanasa Movement began its operations in 1978, 40 percent of the population did not have access to the banking and financial sector.
The change of the logo is also one such step. With this transformation, we will be widening the scope and efficiency of the services extended to the public so far. We will also be opening our doors to afford opportunities for those who have not yet transacted business with us. Our aim is to make a sustained contribution to the economic development of the country while consolidating the unique identity of the bank, she added.
Under the corporate restructuring programme, sectors such as cooperative banking, consumer banking and small and medium-scale entrepreneur solutions will receive greater prominence. The banks network of branches will be actively involved in this new programme.
SDB Bank CEO Nimal Hapuarachchi said that the bank was able to win the confidence of the people of Sri Lanka through some very important services provided over a long time.
It gives us great satisfaction to have been able to make sustained progress as a bank that made a real change in the very competitive financial services sector, he noted.
SDB Bank is hopeful that the new changes will be able to generate a greater trust in the bank among the public which will further carry forward the legacy of the Sanasa Movement.

SLC reverse controversial clause after COPE probe
	
Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) on Wednesday decided to reverse a controversial clause in the Articles of Association of Cricket Aid (Guarantee) Ltd giving its signatories life-membership of this newly-formed charity arm of SLC.
The matter came to light when the Parliamentary Watchdog Committee on Public Enterprise (COPE) questioned it, leading to an order from the Sports Minister to reverse section 6.1.
A brainchild of SLC Chairman Thilanga Sumathipala who first initiated the project in 2005 to help victims of the Boxing Day tsunami the previous year, Cricket Aid was re-launched this year with 13 primary objectives.
They include provision of assistance and relief in times of natural disasters and national emergencies, assistance in times of medical crises, monetary and material assistance to uplift poverty and support and assistance to orphaned and destitute minors.
Cricket Aid was incorporated under the Companies Act of No. 7 of 2007 on May 16, 2016. While their objectives in forming the company are specified in the Articles of Associations, the signatories intentions in including Article 6.1 - making the current Ex-co life members of the company - are ambiguous.
Some signatories that the Daily Mirror contacted claimed they had blindly endorsed the document prepared by the Executive Committee Member Sujeewa Godaliyadda. This would make it a serious blunder by the men running the million-dollar cricket business in the country.
Article 6.1 recognizes ten members, namely Thilanga Sumathipala, Jayantha Dharmadasa, K. Mathivanan, Mohan de Silva, Ravin Wickremaratne, Shammi Silva, Lalith Rambukwella, Ashley de Silva, Sujeewa Godaliyadda and Priyantha Algama, as the first as well as life members of Cricket Aid. They have signed in a private capacity, although they should have done it in their official capacity.
For an instance, Sumathipala has signed, not as the SLC President, but as the Deputy Speaker and Member of Parliament. Wickremaratne has signed as General Manager while the rest, including SLC CEO Ashley de Silva, has signed as businessmen. 
Its a serious mistake, one said. We didnt read it when signed the document. Three members gave the same excuse. We took a decision to rectify it, he added. Luckily, we have not made any transactions through the account we set up. Had we made any, it would have been a bigger mess.
Critics argue, however, that the SLC members were trying to pull a fast one but were forced to eat humble pie after COPE exposed them. (Champika Fernando)

Standard Chartereds (StanChart) global Internet banking platform Straight2Bank will now facilitate Lanka IOC PLCs migration to automated payments and collections.
This facility was ceremonially inaugurated by Lanka IOC Chairman B.S. Canth on his visit to Sri Lanka by approving its maiden electronic payment.
The event was attended by senior officials of Lanka IOC and Standard Chartered.
The ERP support was provided by Ceylon Petroleum Storage Terminals Ltd (CPSTL), which is a joint venture company of Lanka IOC PLC. This three-way partnership is set to change the transaction banking landscape of Sri Lankas oil and gas industry.
Standard Chartered Transaction Banking Head Bingumal Thewarathanthri commenting on the new facility said, Developing solutions that are progressive and cutting edge is a key focus of our transaction banking business. This implementation is a testament to how well Standard Chartered is placed in Sri Lanka to help organisations such as Lanka IOC PLC minimize the use of paper and leverage on technology by relying on a standardized electronic platform to execute payables, perform reconciliations and fast forward receivables in a seamless manner.
Speaking at the inauguration ceremony, Lanka IOC PLC Senior Vice President Finance Anuj Jain emphasised, Automation has played a pivotal role in streamlining processes and mitigating operational risks in our parent organisation IOC, which transacts over 90 percent of payments and receivables electronically through online banking platforms. We are confident that we can build on our experiences and achieve optimum levels of automation in Sri Lanka through Standard Chartereds global internet banking platform.
Lanka IOC Managing Director Shyam Bohra mentioned that he is encouraged by the technological advancements in the banking sector which offers substantial benefits to all associated stakeholders. He also appreciated the manner in which Lanka IOCs banking partner has effectively connected systems seamlessly to deliver this solution.
Standard Chartered Commercial Banking Sales Head Roger Norton further commented, At its early stages of the roll out, Lanka IOCs collections and payments will be executed through the automated clearing house (ACH) and then be migrated to the real-time clearing platform by leveraging on the common electronic fund transfer switch (CEFT), which facilitates immediate fund realisation on a 24 X 7 basis, administered online through Standard Chartereds Internet banking platform,
Straight2Bank. The solution is a celebration of collaborating systems such as SAP, Virtual Accounts and state-of-the-art clearing mechanisms, which will accelerate the working capital cycle of Lanka IOC.
In Sri Lanka, Lanka IOC was incorporated in 2002 and currently operates over 199 filling stations, distributing automotive fuel, servo lubricants, bitumen and bunkers and is a comprehensive fuelling service provider.

Techno City will spearhead huge increase in GDP: Ranawaka
	
Innovative technology was the only way to increase GDP, and the Techno City, which was to be built soon at a cost of nearly Rs. 20 billion, would play a major role in achieving this goal, Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka emphasized.
Usually, we need to invest 4.5 per cent of GDP to achieve a one per cent increase in GDP. But if we invest that amount in innovations, we can increase the GDP in a much more effective manner. We can expect an increase of upto 8 - 9 per cent, he said.
Commenting on the Techno City that was to come up soon, the minister said a Mega Urban Zone would be developed starting from the Kahathuduwa entrance and expanding upto the Kaduwela entrance of the Southern Expressway. The new zone would provide employment opportunities in the fields of nano, gene, bio, atomic and space technology as well as the widely popular information technology (IT). All universities and technical colleges will be brought here and we will develop the city with all facilities for professionals to engage in these fields, including housing facilities, he said.
He assured that the project would have no vested interests. This innovative city is not a Maithri City or a Wickremesinghe City. This is a project based on the policies of the government and not based on the whims of certain individuals, he said.
Minister Ranawaka said the University of Moratuwa, Science, Technology and Research Ministry and Arthur C Clark Institution for Modern Technologies would invest a total of Rs. 19,796 million (nearly Rs. 20 B) in the projects associated with the Techno City in its first phase.(Lahiru Pothmulla)

Speaking during the debate on the motion to increase remuneration to the heads of independent commissions in Parliament, the Deputy Minister said he would continue to talk about these ministers and MPs.
"I will name these MPs even though their names are expunged from the Hansard. Expunging their names from the Hansard will not stop our message from reaching the people" he said.
"There are MPs who used to come to Parliament in taxis in the past but own helicopters and homes in Dubai," he said, adding that some members of Parliament even own apple orchards in Australia.
He also advised journalists who gather at the Bribery Commission to cover a story to be watchful as many government MPs who called over to be interrogated often slip out the back entrance without being noticed.
The MP said institutions that deals with corruption should be strengthened further as this would deter those who plan to rob public funds from engaging in such criminal acts.
Mr Ramanayake lauded some judges and criticized others. " Some judges surreptitiously grant bail to those who are corrupt in the middle of the night," he alleged. (Yohan Perera and Kelum Bandara)
