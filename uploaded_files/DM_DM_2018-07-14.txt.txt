A'pura MC approves resolution to sing national anthem in cinema halls
	
A resolution submitted by Anuradhapura Municipal Council's Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna member Ranjith Rajakaruna that cinema hall owners should be instructed to play the national anthem at all cinema halls before the screening movies, was unanimously passed at the monthly council meeting yesterday.
It was decided to request the President and Cultural Affairs Minister to direct all the cinema hall owners to implement the resolution at all the cinema halls in the country.
The councillor said most Sri Lankans do not remember the national anthem and added that playing it several times at a cinema hall would help them remember it.
He said the Indian Supreme Court had also directed that their national anthem should be sung at the cinema halls there. (Dayarathne Ambogama)

ACCEPTED HISTORY
	

I have written earlier about the Ramayana

He knew the art of aeronautics as he was able to glide over Sitas forest

As a former teacher and on-going student of History, Uditha Devapriyas Reflections on History Lessons interested me very much. It has always irked me that so few beliefs of Sri Lankan History are not supported by factual research and acceptable proof in the realm of knowledge.
I give below the criteria by which History can be declared to be irrefutable. So much of History does not meet this criteria. For example, how factual is the belief that Mahinda was Emperor Asokas son In fact it is generally believed he had no offspring. Certainly no son inherited his empire. It is however a fact that Asoka sent missionaries round Asia to propagate Buddhism. Mahinda may have been a Prince of his court or even a relative. Of course this is a minor detail but it illustrates my point.
Taking the points in the box as criteria how much of Sri Lankan History can be taken as factual
Of course all the standards need not be met but at least some of these rules must be present if History is to be declared factual. 

I have written earlier about the Ramayana. In my opinion that it was Ravana and not Rama who was the real hero of the tale
Many facts of History are now being questioned. Another example is the writings of Marco Polo. Did he really go to China or was he merely repeating stories of his fathers visits Was he ever at the Imperial court of Kublai Khan If he was there why did he leave out descriptions of important social activity like the tea ceremony for example Would Kublai Khan have made a foreigner Governor of a Province when to become a public servant (Mandarins for example) the most difficult examinations had to be done. An uneducated (comparatively) Italian boy would hardly have qualified for such an important post.
I have written earlier about the Ramayana. In my opinion it was Ravana and not Rama who was the real hero of the tale. Consider these facts. Ravana supposedly had 10 heads which meant he was as clever as ten men. He knew the art of aeronautics as he was able to glide over Sitas forest and transport her through the air to Sri Lanka. He was a truly noble character since he did not touch Sita sexually. Rama on the other hand treated Sita abominally and was an absolute chauvinist. 
I can go on endlessly but there is no doubt that History is being rewritten. I hope Sri Lankan historians will be financed by interested people allowing them to engage in research which will give us a better understanding of our own great history.
Legends should not be treated as facts and schoolchildren should be taught the difference.

Preconditions needed to declare legends or myths as historical facts.
1. The availability of written texts AT THAT TIME.
2. Epigraphy. The inscriptions available. Until James Princep discovered the Asokan pillar the Indians themselves had more or less forgotten the great Buddhist Emperor of the Gupta Era.
3. Philology. The meaning of words AT THAT TIME is important. Biblical words , for instance are often allegorical or had a totally different meaning. For instance Eye of the needle was a gate. No camel could possible pass through the eye of a needle!
4. Verification by Archaeology.
5. Metrollogy. This is system of weighing and measuring which alters meanings from century to century
6. Iconography. History can be deduced from statues of the time. (Obviously not always available.)

7. Seals of the time. Royal Seals. Judicial seals. Mercantile Seals etc.
8. Writings of CONTEMPORARY historians  not just ONE man but several. Many writers of the same period should say the same thing  more or less. The Roman era for instance recorded everything in detail and yet there is very little contemporary writing on the life of Jesus. Suetonius makes a passing reference to him as did Joseph who was a Romanised Jew. No one else mentioned him in an era of great scholastic and philosophical works. Of course the Lives of all the Great Teachers cannot meet this criteria but what is important in religion are the TEACHINGS and nothing else
(in my opinion).

Asia and pacific region should agree for a regional policy
	

Sri Lanka had the most advanced water management systems in the world in the ancient era
The impacts of climate change adversely affect this small island and Sri Lanka ranked as the fourth

currently the island is experiencing a massive water imbalance, triggering a great economic loss as well as risking lives of the poor and vulnerable

Palitha Range Bandara
- State Minister of Irrigation and Water Resource Management

Asia and Pacific region should agree for a regional policy to address water-related disaster risk reduction said State Minister of Irrigation and Water Resource Management, Palitha Range Bandara, at a special side event on Water and Disaster Risk Reduction in Asia at the Asian Ministerial Conference on Disaster Risk Reduction (AMCDRR) 2018. He further indicated that the Ministry would give its fullest support on these efforts. The State Minister in his speech emphasised that although Sri Lanka had the most advanced water management systems in the world in the ancient era, currently the island is experiencing a massive water imbalance, triggering a great economic loss as well as risking lives of the poor and vulnerable.In addition to this, the impacts of climate change adversely affect this small island and Sri Lanka ranked as the fourth, in the recently released Global Climate Risk Index. 
The State Minister detailed these at a government-led special side event on Water and Disaster Risk Reduction in Asia, held on Wednesday, 4 June 2018 at Ulanbator, Mongolia. This special panel event was led by the Ministry of Environment and Tourism of Mongolia, with the support of Global Water Partnership (GWP) and co-hosted by the Government of Japan and High-level Experts and Leaders Panel on Water and Disaster (HELP). The event brought together international experiences and approaches in the Asian context with the leaders from organizations that have the capacity and reach to support countries in their quest to address water-related disasters and realize development gains with an all of society approach for a more sustainable development. 
The High-level Experts and Leaders Panel on Water and Disasters (HELP) produced a set of Principles on Investment and Financing for Water-related Disaster Risk Reduction, and launched a flagship document on good practices and lessons of drought and flood management. Featured in these documents as concrete action on the ground are international Help Desks, implemented jointly by GWP and the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) together with over 60 international organizations that are part of these joint programmes on drought and flood management.
The Global Water Partnership (GWP) is an international network that was created to foster the implementation of Integrated Water Resources Management in order to maximise economic and social welfare without compromising the sustainability of ecosystems and the environment. Building on its efforts to strengthen climate resilience throughout Asia, GWP supported the Government of Mongolia in its leadership as part of the Asia Ministerial Conference on Disaster Risk Reduction (AMCDRR) to inspire countries across Asia to meet the most pressing targets of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction.

'Ava' gangsters influenced by violence in Tamil films: Minister
	
After a fact finding mission in Jaffna, Law and Order Minister Ranjith Madduma Bandara said yesterday the Ava criminal gang was a phenomenon created by some youngsters influenced by violent scenes in Tamil films.
He told Daily Mirror from Jaffna that these Tamil youths were emulating the violent scenes to instill fear before carrying out their criminal activities such as robberies.
"They brandish swords to terrorize the people," the minister said and confirmed that the senior police officers based in the area had briefed him about the ground situation."It is not as bad as it is portrayed by the media and by political opponents," the minister said.
He said the police seized as many as 3,000 kilos of Kerala ganja smuggled into the country last year in the north. (Kelum Bandara)

Balasubramaniam Surendra He believed in the dignity of all human beings
	
16th of July 2018 marks the 3rd month of the passing of Balasubramaniam Surendra, Suren as he was known to many of us. It was with profound shock and sadness that his family, countless friends and associates learnt of the news of his passing.
Suren was born with the proverbial silver spoon and was nurtured in a privileged background, yet he never lost the common touch, nor the ability to empathise, feel and respond to anothers need. He had his education at St Thomass College Mount Lavinia and following his professional studies he joined the family business which he was heading at the time of his untimely demise. 

Being a diehard Thomian, he greatly valued the kinship and camaraderie he shared with his STC batch mates
Suren was indeed a very lively, sensitive, kind and gentle human being and always saw the good in every human being. He was honest and ethical and was respected by all those he associated with. He valued human beings over monetory gains and had a strong sense of duty towards the staff of the company he headed. I remember a staff member saying he would always greet us and inquire about our well being each day as he came into work. 
He believed in the dignity of all human beings. Following his death many were the tales of his selfless and silent acts and kindness.

Today we live in a society that encourages and advocates hedonism glorifying self-interest, narcissism amidst an ethic that admires and values unbridled ambition, amassing material possessions, the abandonment of human decency with no respect for human dignity

Suren had a tremendous zest for life and was happiest when surrounded by his family and friends. His subtle sense of humour brought much wit and light entertainment to the times spent with him and the memories of those wonderful times will be cherished. He would always choose to talk of the funny side of life rather than dwell on the gloomy. He was a dutiful and caring spouse to his wife Uma, a loving father to his children Aparna and Santheep, a wonderful brother to his sisters Shyama and Vanaja and an affectionate uncle to his nieces and nephews. 
Being a diehard Thomian, he greatly valued the kinship and camaraderie he shared with his STC batch mates. He was a generous host and together with his wife Uma hosted many get togethers which will be remembered by all. The widow of a batch mate who passed away recently told me that Suren had been a tower of strength to her and was always there for her family in their darkest hours following the bereavement of her husband .The countless number of relatives and friends who flew in from different parts of the world for his funeral all in the brief time of 03 days bore ample testimony to the love with which he was held. 

Suren was indeed a very lively, sensitive, kind and gentle human being and always saw the good in every human being

Today we live in a society that encourages and advocates hedonism glorifying self-interest, narcissism amidst an ethic that admires and values unbridled ambition, amassing material possessions, the abandonment of human decency with no respect for human dignity. Rarely are we privileged to encounter an individual such as Suren whose values ran counter to the worldview of our time and age.
Reflecting on the life of Suren we realize that the world is indeed poorer for his loss. It is hard to believe that this larger than life personality is no more yet the lives of the people he touched will inspire us to serve our fellow human beings with love, and remember that every human being has his own worth and dignity.
Farewell dear friend & may you find eternal rest and peace.

Carrying out death sentence won't stop crimes: Ajith P Perera
	
Carrying out the death sentence will not stop crimes, State Minister Ajith P. Perera told a media briefing yesterday and added that this is a reality he learned through his experience as a lawyer and a lecturer at the police training school.
I have learned though my experience the crimes cannot be stopped by imposing the death sentence but we will support President Maithripala Sirisena in his decision to the impose death sentence on those who are charged with crimes pertaining to drugs, he said.
Referring to the statement made by Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith, who welcomed Presidents decision the state minister said one wonders whether the Catholic Church has changed its stance on the death sentence as it did not hold a favorable view on it earlier .
Meanwhile, he said number of thefts had come down to 3,366 in 2017 when compared with 3455 in 2016. He said the thefts reported between January 2018 and May, 2018 was 1260 and that one could anticipate that number of thefts would be reduced by the end of 2018 compared to the previous year.
"Solving rate for thefts had increased to 74 per cent in 2017 when compared with 70.2 per cent in the previous year. Solving rate of thefts within the first five months in 2018 has been 59.5 percent. The number of murders recorded in 2017 was 420 compared with 466 in 2016. Murders during the first five months have been 214 in 2018. Rate of solving of murders has been 92.8 percent in 2017 compared to 93 percent in 2016. Rate of Solving of murders during the first five months of 2018 has been 85 percent. It would be unfair for a person to accuse the police of being inefficient in dealing with crime when one looks at this data, the state minister said. (Yohan Perera)

CPC, a National Asset in Ruin
	
99%of students boycotted the American BUN!

CPCs evasionon payments under agreement resulted in the banks filing action against them in InternationalCourts in 2009

The world experienced severe recession in 2008, with demand for oil curbing drastically

A report from the Auditor Generals Department noted that CPC has sustained a total loss of Rs. 9 billion on the disastrous hedging deal.

Shell, [British] Caltex and Esso [American] were the three powerful American oil giants which dominated the import, storage, transportation, marketing and distribution of Ceylons petroleum business up to 1964.
In the good old days when a car enters a station for petrol, the workers who have plenty of leisure, [as a car drops in at an average 10 or 15 minute intervals], two or three workers flock around it, with one cleaning the windscreen, others checking tyre pressures, oil levels or making a few comments on the vehicle, condition of the road ahead and so on. Then the cars did not have water jets spraying on to the glass, and there were no ACs: Power shutters or power steering never heard of.Petrol sold in gallons cost less than Rs 1.50 a gallon [4.5 Lit] was pumped manually.The three companies operated on an understanding that where the prices of the products were concerned they would not compete. They knew that price competition was disastrous for all players. Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaikes government took-over the entire operation in a monopoly under the SLFP governments nationalisation policy thinking the country would save billions in foreign exchange, that the three multinational oil giants continued to siphon out annually by way of profits. 

It was two Silvas, both senior civil servants of the day, GVS and Sam who had convinced T.B. Illangaratne, the socialist oriented minister on the exploitation of our funds and resources by the oil giants

The Nationalization Move
It was two Silvas, both senior civil servants of the day, GVS and Sam who had convinced T.B. Illangaratne, the socialist oriented minister on the exploitation of our funds and resources by the oil giants. They presented the facts and figures showing that the country could profit if the oils were imported directly and distributed by the state. That was the time when Bandaranaike governments went on a nationalization spree. Sam Silva became the first chairman of CPC, a monopoly that commenced operations.
It could lead to the disintegration of Ceylons tea and rubber markets which then were the countrys bread and butter.., said the oil companies writing articles in the newspapers; warning authorities which initially drew angry reaction from PM Sirimavo Bandaranaike. However a few months later the government acquired the assets of the three oil companies under the enactment, Ceylon Petroleum Corporation Act No. 28 of 1961. The legal draftsman unjustifiably had worded the section on
compensation as 
The amount to be paid under this Bill for property vested in the Corporation shall be the original price incurred by the company for procurement of said property less an allowance for depreciation -[ Section 47] The three companies backed by America and the powerful west who dominated the global petroleum industry did not take the move lying down. American President Dwight D. Eisenhower and subsequently John F. Kennedy gave us a plain bun sometimes with sesame seeds or a little sugar spread on top, a delicacy children enjoyed six decades ago. When all attempts to prevent the acquisition failed, America used its trump card; a threat to scrap the facility known as PL 480- an Aid programme, under which we got free wheat flour from the United States for the mid-day meal of school children.

Oil Hedging 2007 -
Sri Lankas state run oil monopoly under Chairman, [Sri Lankas former speed-bowler and President Rajapaksas relative] Asantha de Mel made crude oil price hedging deals with private banks in 2007, without utilizing the services of experts for such a multifaceted option. When the market crashed, the hedging deals depressing payoff for the Corporation reached thousands of millions. CPCs evasion on payments under agreement resulted in the banks filing action against them in International
Courts in 2009.
They signed into oil price hedging deals with Standard Chartered, Citi Bank, Deutsche Bank, Peoples Bank and the Commercial Bank .The agreement stated that the CPC had gone into the hedging of risk under zero cost collars on a ceiling of $130/- per barrel and a floor of $100/- per barrel, decided by CPC and the banks respectively, meaning that when the oil prices rose above $130/- per barrel the banks paid the difference. Similarly for floor, when the prices fell below $100/- CPC paid the banks the difference. The agreement stated that the contracts would terminate if the price remained above $130/- for 3 consecutive months with CPC, can buy a maximum 100,000 barrels per month. But, if the prices remained lower than $100/- for 12 months, only then will the deal expire in effect if the oil market crashes the contract was valid for 12 months; and during that 12 month period CPC was obligatory to buy 200,000 barrels per month. The hedging deal had restricted the loss for the banks for price increases, alternatively, for a fall the contract had placed a high rate on the
Corporation to pay.

CPC in a very idiotic move depended on the bankers own consultants for advice. It was similar to heads I win, tails you lose gamble in favour of the banks, perhaps backed by under-the-table deals

The world experienced severe recession in 2008, with demand for oil curbing drastically. In the months of July and August alone the prices dropped drastically from over $140/- a barrel to a under $60 per barrel. Following the non-payment by CPC, three banks sought a ruling from international arbitrators claiming that the client violated an international contract by defaulting on the derivative dealings. Some banks filed action in high courts in cities where their headquarters were established, and the rulings except in one case were against the Corporation, compelling them to settle huge sums of money as compensation. With no proper risk appraisal done, the CPC hierarchy failed to assess the volatility of the oil market. Such complex option deals necessitates appointment of experts specialized in international banking. CPC in a very idiotic move depended on the bankers own consultants for advice. It was similar to heads I win, tails you lose gamble in favour of the banks, perhaps backed by under-the-table deals.

COPE revealed loss of over Rs 10 billion
CJ, Sarath N Silva ruling on a Fundamental Rights Petition filed with the Supreme Court, citing that the Hedging Deal caused losses, courts declared that all payments by CPC be suspended forthwith and the benefit gained to be used to bring down the Petrol price to Rs 100 per litre. The government disregarded the ruling. According to COPE, the loss suffered by the country was a staggering Rs.10.2 billion. COPE even made calculations of all related expenses, payments made to banks, future payments, legal expenses, miscellaneous expenses; the total loss would be around Rs.15 billion.

Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaikes government took-over the entire operation in a monopoly under the SLFP governments nationalisation policy thinking the country would save billions in foreign exchange

Auditor General Reports 9 billion loss
A report from the Auditor Generals Department noted that CPC has sustained a total loss of Rs. 9 billion on the disastrous hedging deal. The biggest beneficiary was Standard Chartered Bank, who received US$ 60 million as compensation in 2013. The travelling cost of top officials who appeared in international tribunals was given as Rs. 5,261,827/-
When J. F. Kennedy threatened to scrap the free bun to schools, the writer was studying in the O/Level class.
Our courageous Prime Minister Sirimavo, who with only an years experience in politics, posed the question to the schools student population; a choice between, a free mid-day bun made of Americas wheat flour or national sovereignty It was President Dwight Eisenhower who introduced the law, the Agricultural Trade Development and Assistance Act - 1954, usually known as Public Law [PL]480. 
Encouraged by that kind of patriotic, radical opinion from madam Sirimavo, 26 out of 29 in my class decided to sacrifice the mid-day meal and stage a boycott of the American Carrot.

Mid-day Meal Boycott
One fine morning, in 2011 I was on my way to the city. The car that had been pumped with petrol only a few hours before, stalled and did not start. It had to be towed to the garage of the agents in Wattala at a massive cost, where it was established that the CPC sub-standard fuel had
damaged the engine.
The fuel had to be drained while the petrol pump and injector were replaced at a cost of Rs. 36,000/- Automobile engineers say, the engine might backfire, the valve might burn, and there could be carbon deposits. The Petroleum Minister Premajayantha admitted that 20,000 metric tons of petrol imported were sub-standard and that he was on a private visit to Italy when CPC ordered it from a company in the UAE which was not listedwith the CPC.
Thousands of cars were out of the roads for which the corporation promised to reimburse the repair cost. 
Sixty years on, as a victim of the substandard petrol scam, I had to visit CPC head office, where they display prominently the MissionTo achieve excellence in refining, sales and marketing of high quality products and meet the expectations of the stakeholders through a dedicated team of professionals by providing total solutions and services exceeding customer expectation, I carried with me all certified documents for the claim only to receive shoddy treatment by some irresponsible staff in the very institution in whose defence we had risen in our small way as school children 56 years ago. I feel sad that the CPC has come through this regretful pass today.

Drug traffickers - Dilshan praises MS for implementing death sentence
	
Sri Lanka former national cricket team's ca[taom T.M. Dilshan yesterday praised President Maithripala Sirisenas decision to implement the death sentence for drug traffickers.
He said this decision should have been taken a long time ago. Not only for drugs, it should be implemented for child abuse and rape cases, he said.
Dilshan said all citizens should unite to develop the country.
There is no purpose in safeguarding human rights if we cannot save the country. Cases of drugs use and child abuse has increased at an alarming rate today. So is is essential to carry out the death sentence, he said and added that if our children are not protected and safeguarded our country would be left without a future for the generations to come.

Election meddling and New York Times selective focus on China
	

While much ink has already been spilled over The New York Times recent piece on Chinese bribes allegedly given to the Rajapaksa camp ahead of the 2015 presidential election, some interesting questions remain to be addressed.
Setting aside, for now, the reports inaccuracies (such as describing the Port City project as a terminal in Colombo port, built by China Harbour, which held 50 acres of land over which Sri Lanka had no sovereignty, leaving officials with little real control when a Chinese submarine called in 2014), among the questions that need to be asked are: Why China And why now Whats the rationale for Americas newspaper of record taking the trouble to resurrect, at this point in time, a three-year-old report from Sri Lankas state-run Daily News about a corruption investigation that led nowhere
From a news point of view, there are two main elements in the story that would be grist to the mill of any newspaper. One is the aspect of corruption in high places, and the other is that of meddling in other peoples elections. NYT chose to write about alleged Chinese meddling in Sri Lankas election while ignoring reports that RAW (Research & Analysis Wing) the spy agency of USs strategic ally India, allegedly influenced the outcome by facilitating defections from the SLFP so that a former SLFP minister could run as the common candidate in a UNP-led campaign. The strategy succeeded in bringing about regime-change by wresting a sufficient number of Sinhala-majority votes from the SLFP to tilt the numbers, in combination with the traditionally UNP-friendly minority vote. The UNP-led campaign was peppered with anti-China rhetoric.

The timing of this story is also interesting in the way it effectively deflected media attention from a much bigger corruption scandal involving prominent government figures
The strategic nexus between the US and India has been growing apace in recent years. Former US president Barack Obama in his speech as chief guest at Indias Republic Day celebration on 26th January 2015  just weeks after Sri Lanka concluded its 8th January election  said the US welcomes a greater role for India in the Asia Pacific and went on to mention Sri Lanka: India can play a role in helping countries forge a better future, from Burma to Sri Lanka, where today theres new hope for democracy. With your experience in elections you can help other countries with theirs. 
China meanwhile has been identified by the US as the reason for its heightened interest in the Indian Ocean and its pursuit of stronger defence ties with India. The US position was clearly spelt out by former US Secretary of Defence Rex Tillerson in a speech at Washingtons Centre for Strategic and International Studies last October. Sri Lanka is currently caught up in a tug-of-war between US and China in their fight for dominance in the Indian Ocean region on account of its strategic location, straddling important sea lanes connecting Asia with the Middle East and Africa. Its not hard to see how targeting alleged Chinese corruption in relation to a strategic asset like Hambantota port would serve US strategic interests. The allegation that former president Mahinda Rajapaksas campaign benefited from it, kills two birds with one stone by discrediting both China and a political leader seen as being too-China-friendly, at the same time. 
When Western powers strategic interests are at stake, Western mainstream media typically tend to align with their respective governments positions in reporting an issue. This could be seen in their reporting on Iraq, Ukraine and Syria for example. With the USs strategic focus shifting to the Pacific and Indian oceans the NYT report on Sri Lanka illustrates how US mainstream media serve their governments interests in this region.
But the election is over, and MR lost. So this brings us to the second question: why now 
Februarys landslide victory at the local government elections by Rajapaksas new political formation, with a presidential election and general election set to take place in 2019 and 2020, may help explain the timing. The local poll results shook up the US-friendly yahapalana government by showing where popular support now lies. Given the high stakes in the big powers games of one-upmanship in the Indian Ocean, it would not be surprising to see more news of this type reaching Sri Lankan shores in the months ahead.
The timing of this story is also interesting in the way it effectively deflected media attention from a much bigger corruption scandal involving prominent government figures. Though corruption is a main focus of the NYT piece, it chose to focus on an alleged Chinese bribe of US$ 7.6 million in a past election, when all eyes were currently on the bond scam. It involves the much bigger sum of US$ 69 million (Rs.11 billion) that former Central Bank governor Arjuna Mahendran is accused of embezzling, with the main beneficiary being his son-in-law Arjun Aloysiuss company Perpetual Treasuries Ltd. (PTL). 
So far, it has been revealed that two ministers and an MP received cheques from Aloysius or PTL-affiliated companies, which they said they used in their campaign for the August 2015 parliamentary election. The first bond scam had already been exposed in February 2015, and their claims that they didnt know where the money came from, rang hollow. The fact that two of them offered to refund the money suggests they were not comfortable with it. The media naturally had a field day with this abundant supply of headline-making news. But after the NYT story broke, reporters have stopped button-holing various MPs and sticking microphones in front of them to ask Did you take PTL money 
An issue that Sri Lanka really needs to be concerned about as an outcome of recent exposures and allegations of election campaign-related corruption, is the urgent need for laws to regulate election campaign financing. The politicians who benefited from PTLs largesse have made remarks to the effect that accepting donations was ok, that it is normal for businessmen to support election campaigns, that no one spends their own money etc. If it is not ok to take money from a tainted company, is it ok to take from a reputable company Whos to know about the reputation of donors if there is no account of the funds, where they came from or what they were used for If no limit is set on the amount, does the party with richer friends and more donations have an unfair advantage And what about foreign funding
It would seem that Sri Lankan politicians of all stripes and from both the mainstream parties are content to continue with the present unregulated system when it comes to election campaign financing. This could be one reason why no party is eager to pursue its opponent over this particular issue. The Rajapaksa administration was accused of high-level corruption and was unseated on an anti-corruption platform in 2015. Where the UNP is concerned, apart from the bond scam exposures there is at least one election-finance related petition submitted for investigation by the bribery commission (CIABOC), alleging Rs. 60 million given to a high ranking UNPer by a businessman in 2001. The petitioner, former state minister Rajiva Wijesinha says he believes the money was used to bribe MPs to cross over so as to bring down the government which president Kumaratunga had constituted following the 2000 election. 
With foreign powers showing heightened interest in Sri Lanka, and the possibility of election-related bribes of a much higher order being offered in exchange for influence, the need for campaign-finance laws becomes all the more urgent. In this new context their absence leaves a gaping hole that threatens not only the integrity of elections, but now, the national interest as well.

New Delhi (Hindustan Times), July 13, 2018 - Journalist Reham Khan, who was briefly married to Imran Khan, has claimed in her autobiography that the cricketer-turned-politician told her that he sired at least five illegitimate children, including some Indians. Reham Khan, a British-Pakistani journalist, makes a number of claims in her self-titled autobiography about Imran Khans love life. 
Perhaps the most damning allegation of all in the book is Reham Khans claim about Imran Khans illegitimate children, 
Reham Khan, 45, writes that the issue of the 65-year-old Imrans illegitimate children came up while they were discussing Tyrian, his daughter with the late socialite Sita White, in 2015.

Mr. Kandavanam Kanagasabai A tough personality with a heart of gold
	
Mr. Kandavanam Kanagasabai, who was well known among friends as Kanagasabai hailed from a devout Hindu family from the North. He had his education at St. Henrys College, Illavalai, a Catholic institution, and was a hosteler during the 1950 era. I, a junior, was in the hostel during the same period. I addressed Kanagasabai always as Annai which means elder brother. He was concerned about us juniors who were in the hostel and the sportsmen of the College. 
He was a great soccer player and at that time we had the system of Forwards, Centre Forwards, Extremes and Fullbacks. He was one of the sturdy Fullbacks of the First Eleven Soccer Team of the College. Whenever a member of the opposition team fouled, Kanagasabai would slowly come forward from his position of Fullback and would go after the player of the opposing team and retaliate by engaging him in a good foul, without causing hurt or injury. If there were any issues in the hostel about food and other facilities, he will take up the cause of the hostelers with the Bursars of the Hostel. In exterior he was a rugged, tough looking personality, but was very kind hearted and helpful to everyone. 

Whenever a member of the opposition team fouled , Kanagasabai would slowly come forward from his position of Fullback and would go after the player of the opposing team and retaliate by engaging him in a good foul, without causing hurt or injury
After his departure from College, we did not have much contact. He engaged in business and established himself in Colombo. I became a teacher and subsequently joined the Police Department in 1957. I was posted to the Pettah Police Station in the year 1959/60, which was housed at Dam Street, Pettah. Opposite the Pettah Police Station there was a Rice Stores named K.K.S Stores. Since I hailed from Kankesanturai (KKS), I was curious to find out as to who was the owner of the KKS Stores. To my surprise the owner of this Rice Store was none other than Kanagasabai. From that day onwards we renewed our friendship and became family friends. My wife and I were invitees to all functions of the family. During this association we became very close to his family, his wife Navaratnam Amma, daughters Pamathy and Dayamathy, sons-in-law Ravindran and Jeganathan. Amazingly, he was a keep fit enthusiast, and he used to do a daily walk from Barnes Place to Independence Square. He was a very healthy person. He was a member of the Tamil Union Tennis Club and if my memory serves right, he also captained the Tamil Union Tennis Team. Whilst indulging in sports and other activities, he concentrated on his business and established rice mills and grain factories in the area. He was also a victim of the 1983 communal troubles, where he lost some of his properties. He had to leave the country and went to India until the situation returned to normal. Surprisingly, though he did not have any known illness, he became weak and was feeble. His devoted wife Navaratnam Amma looked after him and cared for him. The two daughters one of whom is a Doctor domiciled in Australia, and the other domiciled in Singapore, visited their parents regularly. Towards the latter part of June he was very feeble and the two daughters came down and along with his wife, cared for him until the day of his death.

He was a benefactor of St. Henrys College, Illavalai and the patron of the Henricians OBAColombo, and also a member of the Henricians Board of Trustees. 
The Bishop of Jaffna the Rt. Revd. Dr. Justin B. Gnanapragasam, was saddened by his demise and had sent Rev. Fr. J.A. Jesuthas, one time rector of St. Henrys College to represent him at the funeral. The present rector of St. Henrys College, Rev. Fr. Godfrey Joel sent his message of condolence, and many members of the Henricians OBA- Colombo, were present at the funeral to show their gratitude for his benevolence towards the College as well as the Henricians OBAColombo. His demise is a great loss to St. Henrys College, Illavalai, and to the Henricians OBAColombo. 
We extend our sympathy to his beloved wife Navaratnam, his loving daughters Pamathy and Dayamathy, sons-in-law Ravindran and Jeganathan, and grandchildren.

NATO leaders deny Trumps claim they agreed to spend more on defence
	

(Daily Mail), 12 July 2018 -
President Donald Trumps claim to have wrung billions in additional commitments for defense contributions from European leaders is already being undercut by NATO leaders and members nations.
Trump triumphantly told reporters before departing the NATO summit in Brussels said the additional money that they will be putting up has been really amazing. 
People have stepped up today like theyve never stepped up before, Trump said, declaring victory. He attributed the change to his contentious whirlwind visit. Yesterday I let them know that I was extremely unhappy with what was happening and they have substantially upped their commitment, Trump said.
But there were no immediate specifics on what Trump said he had achieved, and French President Emmanuel Macron quickly disputed Trumps claim that NATO allies have agreed to boost defense spending beyond 2 percent of gross domestic product. Macron, in his own press conference, seemed to reject Trumps claim that NATO powers had agreed to increases beyond previous targets. He said the allies had confirmed their intention to meet the goal of 2 percent by 2024 and no more.

## Title: Shocking, shameful; about 1,000 abortions daily in Sri Lanka

Shocking, shameful; about 1,000 abortions daily in Sri Lanka
	

Last Wednesday July 11, was World Population Day and the United Nations Fund for Population Activities in a statement says, the international community should focus attention on the urgency and importance of population issues. This years theme is Family Planning is a Human Right.
According to the UNFPA, this year marks the 50th anniversary of the 1968 International Conference on Human Rights, where family planning was, for the first time, globally affirmed to be a human right. The Teheran Proclamation states, Parents have a basic human right to determine freely and responsibly the number and spacing of their children. 
The UNFPA says that tragically reliable family planning methods are out of reach for hundreds of millions of people. Many resort to unsafe, unreliable methods, some of which can be dangerous. UNFPA has collected dozens of examples of harmful and ineffective strategies people employ while trying to prevent pregnancies. Together, these examples highlight the urgent need to improve access to, and information about, modern, reliable family planning.
According to figures compiled by UNFPA and other agencies, the total population for last year was about 7,550 million. For men and women, last years life expectancy rates were 70 and 74 per cent. The rate of unmet need for family planning among women aged 15-49 is 12 per cent. 
The highest populated country is China with about 1,409.5 million last year followed by India with about 1,339.2 million. Last year Sri Lankas population was 20.9 million. 
To mark World Population Day, the Sri Lanka Health Ministrys Family Health Bureau and the Health Promotion Bureau held a news conference where some shocking or sensational if not shameful disclosures were made. Dr. Sanath Lanerolle, Consultant Obstetrician and Gynaecologist at the Castle Street Hospital disclosed that according to reliable information, as many as one thousand abortions were taking place in Sri Lanka every day. A majority are among women of the age of about thirty five but the disturbing trend is that a large number of abortions involve teenagers between the ages of fifteen and nineteen. 
Sri Lanka is considered a religious country with Buddhism, Hinduism, Christianity and Islam being preached even in remote areas and every day on television and radio. Parents and teachers are also expected to guide the children in the right way of living and how to build moral values and character. But if about one thousand voiceless, helpless and innocent unborn children are being killed every day that means the massacre of the innocents amounts to about thirty thousand a month and three hundred and sixty five thousand a year. 
This is a ruthless form of terrorism, three hundred and sixty five thousand unborn babies being massacred every year while respect for human life and any form of life is preached by all religions. In the western world, many countries are seeing battles between those who are supposed to be pro-life and those who are pro-choice meaning that a woman should have the choice whether she should abort a child or not. While the pro-choice campaigners are growing in numbers and popularity, little is spoken about the right of the voiceless, unborn child. In Sri Lanka, such campaigns are not widespread but last Wednesdays disclosures are a serious indictment on the government, religions and religious leaders, parents and teachers. 
We urge the Family Health Bureau, the Health Promotion Bureau, the National Child Protection Authority and other state institutions to coordinate a mission with religious leaders and school authorities to curb this disgraceful and deplorable trend in abortions. Religious founders have warned that those who harm little children deserve to be thrown into the deepest ocean with millstones tied around their necks. On that basis, we dread to think of the fate of those who kill unborn children. Saint Mother Teresa began her mission by telling those who wanted to abort children that she and her missionaries were ready to tenderly care for such children. It was this vision and insight that inspired her to say, love till it hurts, then the love will remain and the hurts will go away.

Foreign men and women from Sri Lanka, China, India, the Philippines, Bangladesh, Pacific islands and Latin America are vulnerable to forced labour in New Zealands agricultural, dairy, construction, viticulture, food service, and hospitality sectors and as domestic workers. Unregulated and unlicensed immigration brokers operating in New Zealand and source countries, particularly in India and the Philippines assist victims of labor exploitation in New Zealand obtain visas, it said.
Meanwhile, it said Sri Lankan domestic workers in Egypt who are not covered under Egyptian labour laws are highly vulnerable to forced labour experiencing excessive working hours, denial of food and medical care and physical and psychological abuse.
The report said Pakistan is also a destination country for men, women, and children subjected to forced labor, particularly from Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka.

Meanwhile, the report said some workers from Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Nepal, Bangladesh and India reportedly experience recruitment fraud before arriving in Maldives.
It said men and women from Sri Lanka, Nepal, India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, the Philippines, Indonesia, Sudan, Kenya, Nigeria, Uganda and other countries voluntarily migrate to Qatar as unskilled laborers and domestic workers.
They often pay illegal and exorbitant fees to unscrupulous recruiters in the labor-sending countries, thereby increasing their vulnerability to debt bondage, the report said.
Commenting on the measures taken by certain countries to help their nationals subjected to exploitative working condition in Kuwait, the US report said Embassies of Sri Lanka, the Philippines and India maintained their own domestic worker shelters and worked closely with the Kuwait government to seek compensation and legal redress for their nationals.

Trump blasts May  during his first official visit to UK
	

After Prime Minister Theresa May rolled out the red carpet at Blenheim Palace on Thursday night for President Donald Trumps first official visit to Britain, a London tabloid published an explosive interview in which Trump blasted Mays compromise, pro-business plan to leave the European Union and warned that her approach could imperil any future trade deal between the United States and Britain. 
The remarks cast an immediate pall over a visit that included a lavish dinner with business leaders Thursday night and plans to meet Queen Elizabeth II for afternoon tea on Friday. It was the latest international incident to erupt during Trumps brief sojourn abroad, which kicked off with incendiary comments that upended a NATO summit in Brussels and further strained relationships with longtime U.S. allies. 
In addition to attacking May on Brexit, Trump also praised her archrival, Boris Johnson, as a potential future prime minister while attacking Londons mayor as soft on crime and terrorism. 
The blunt language and harsh dismissal in Trumps interview stunned 10 Downing Street. 
Mays office did not issue a reply to Trumps remarks but referred reporters to an earlier statement: We have come to an agreement at the proposal were putting to the European Union which absolutely delivers on the Brexit people voted for. They voted for us to take back control of our money, our law and our borders and thats exactly what we will do.
