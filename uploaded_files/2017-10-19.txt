A ten-year-old French boy dies from rabies
	
A ten-year-old French boy has died from rabies after he was bitten by a stray puppy while on holiday in Sri Lanka.
The unnamed boy, from Rhone in eastern France, became infected with the virus in August after the dog bit him on a beach in Dikwella in the south of the country.
His family were not initially concerned following the incident, and the boy returned to France.
However, when he began to show signs of the disease, including difficulty swallowing, at the beginning of October, they took him to hospital in Lyon, according to thelocal.fr.
Rabies targets the nervous system and the brain - and while he was in intensive care, his condition continued to deteriorate.
He died on October 16, the Pasteur Institute said.
Around 60 people, including members of the boy's family, along with staff and pupils at his school, have since received a rabies vaccination as a precaution.
Since 1924, there have been not been any cases of 'indigenous' rabies in humans in metropolitan France.
There have been 23 cases of people contracting the condition while abroad since 1970 - the last being three years ago, according to health authorities.
Rabies, a neglected disease of vulnerable populations, is 100 per cent fatal but also nearly 100 per cent preventable through canine vaccination.
Africa and India still bear the highest burden of total annual rabies deaths.
Countries with the highest fatalities from rabies are India, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, China and Myanmar. (Daily Mail)

CERT issues DoubleLocker ransomware warning
	
The Computer Emergency Readiness Team (CERT|CC) yesterday warned Android mobile users to be cautious of infecting DoubleLocker ransomware when viewing suspicious websites.
Speaking to the Daily Mirror (CERT|CC) Principal Information Security Engineer Roshan Chandragupta said the DoubleLocker ransomware could be affected by installing fake Adobe Flash Player applications. Ransomware requests the mobile user to grant access which it uses to activate the device administrator rights and set itself as the default home application. This allows the ransomware to reactivate itself every time a user clicks on the home button on the phone and new Android ransomware, dubbed DoubleLocker, that has been uncovered, poses multiple threats, he said.
?This ransomware can lock down the victim's phone, encrypting all data and changing the infected phone's PIN. This makes it nearly impossible for victims to retrieve data or access their phones without paying a ransom.
According to foreign media, the DoubleLocker was based on a banking trojan and could become a "ransom-banker", which was essentially a "two-stage malware", that tries to wipe out victims' bank or PayPal accounts, locking the device and data down completely. In other words, victims would be unable to access their data, including bank credentials unless a ransom payment is made.
The hackers operating DoubleLocker are demanding a ransom of $54, ?40 which the victim is required to pay up within 24 hours. However, if the ransom payment isn't made within 24 hours, the data is not deleted and instead remains encrypted.
Apart from paying the ransom and obtaining the decryption key from the hackers, the only way victims can clean out the infected device of DoubleLocker is to perform a factory reset. (Chaturanga Pradeep)

After obtaining the basic training from the farm school, young DS was fully involved with their family?s plantation and graphite companies.
In 1915, Sinhala-Muslim riots erupted in the Gampola area and later its spread to the other parts of the country. DS and other leaders were arrested by the British rulers to prove that DS was directly involved with the riots. However, they were released from jail due to lack of proof.?
In 1924, DS became a member of the National Legislative Council, and subsequently with the dawn of the reforms of Donoughmore Commission, he became the Minister of Lands and Agriculture in 1931. The new Minister of Lands and Agriculture was able to restore the tanks and irrigation network of the dry zone of Ceylon.??

FR Petition on PC (Amendment) Bill: Ex-CJ lashes out at govt.
	
Former Chief Justice Sarath N. Silva today replying to the preliminary objections on the maintainability of his fundamental rights petition charged the Yahapahana government (Good Governance) of repealing all the original clauses and inserting new clauses in the Provincial Council (Amendment) Bill at the Committee Stage.
He alleged that the Constitution was dismantled in the passage of the said Bill. He maintained that the Provincial Councils Amendment Bill ceased to exist.
His fundamental rights application was take up before the Bench comprising Chief Justice Priyasath Dep, Justices B.P.Aluvihara and Nalin Perera.
He submitted that the Bill which is statement of legal effect should have been published in the Gazette and it should be in the public domain.
He submitted that the Supreme Court made its determination of the 20th Amendment and pronounced that certain provisions in the said Bill is inconsistent with the Constitution and if it is to be enacted, it be passed by 2/3 majority of the Parliament.
He said the Government conveniently ignored the said Bill and inserted Clauses in another Amendment Bill for the Provincial Council.
He complained that in the proposed original Bill for 30 percent of Female candidates in the nomination list, one page is removed and 21 new Clauses were inserted. He claimed that as such it is a new Bill and needed to be published in the gazette as a new Bill for people who are the depository of franchise and legislative power.
He said that in the country, the Constitution includes the franchise of the people which is the right to vote and the people are denied their franchise.
He said that in the Bill there is something concocted and the people had no notice on the proposed law.
The intervenient petitioners and the Attorney General are directed to file their objections and the Court reserved its order on the preliminary objection on the maintainability of the petition filed by Sarath N. Silva.
Additional Solicitor General Sanjay Rajaratnam appearing for the Attorney General raised three preliminary Objections on the maintainability of Sarath N. Silva?s fundamental rights on the ground of suppression of material facts, no jurisdiction and Parliamentary powers and privileges Act.
He also pointed out that the petition did not mention in the threshold caption under which article he was coming to Court. He said if it is a fundamental rights petition he should seek administrative and executive reliefs but in his petition he is seeking a declaration from the Court that the Speaker is not empowered by law to certify the said Bill which was passed at the 2nd Reading by Parliament and that the Speaker is estopped in law from endorsing a certificate on such amended Bill as having been duly passed in Parliament.
He said the Petitioner is challenging the validity of certification by the Speaker and the legislative process
He brought to the cognizance that the Bill was certified by the Speaker on 22n September 2017 and the Petitioner filed his petition on 28th September 2017 so he has suppressed the material fact.
M.A.Sumanthiran PC in his submission stated that the Supreme Court has no jurisdiction to hear or to determine the said application.
He said that this application could not be entertained as it is matter of Parliament wherein the there is parliamentary powers and privileges Act.
He cited and judgment delivered by three judges Bench consisting Chief Justice Sarath N Silva.
In the judgment delivered on ?Monetary law 9Amendment) Act and Inland Revenue (Special Provisions) Bill, he stated that Citizen Silva in this petition who was the then Chief Justice pronounced that the petitioners are bound by the preclusive Clause and cannot invoke the jurisdiction of this Court in respect of the validity of the Acts of Parliament and that the petitioners are seeking to indirectly to achieve the result by challenging the Bills which preceded the respective Acts of Parliament.
He submitted that former Chief Justice has ruled that therefore the petitioners cannot circumvent the preclusive Clause as contained in Article 80(3) in respect of the Acts of Parliament by seeking to challenge the validity of the provisions of the Bill which preceded those Acts of Parliament.
Court fixed for September 19 the hearing of the further submission of the intervenient petitioners.
Suren Fernando instructed by G.G.Arulpragasam appearing for Intervenient Hashim Kabir MP submitted that the petitioner Silva is indirectly attempting to challenge the legislative process, an act which is expressly prohibited in terms of the Constitution.

He contended that the affairs of the Parliament is to be regulated by the House itself and the Court should not interfere in these matters.
He submitted the judicial power of the people is to be exercised by Parliament with regard to matters relating to privileges, immunities and powers of Parliament.
He pointed out that the petitioner?s onslaught on the Attorney General was unfounded, malicious and misconceived in fact and law.
He said if this petition was to be allowed, it would open the doors for any person to challenge Acts passed by Parliament, by circuitous means.
He submitted It is akin to what Chief Justice Sarath N. Silva had held when he nullifie the merger of the Northern and Eastern Provinces on a similar ground .
Former Chief Justice Sarath Nanda Silva filed his fundamental rights violation petition challenging the enactment of the Provincial Council Elections Amendment Bill.
The Former Chief Justice cited the Attorney General Jayantha Jayasuriya PC, the Speaker of Parliament Karu Jayasuriya and the Chairman and members of the Elections Commission as respondents charging that at the Committee Stage of enacting the Bill, all the operative Clauses of the published Bill passed at the Second Reading of the Bill were deleted and an entirely new set of provisions had been introduced.

IBSL discusses way forward for Sri Lanka?s insurance industry
	
Following the declaration of 1st September as National Insurance Day and Insurance Awareness Month well underway, it was a most opportune moment to consult two top professionals in the industry.?
Indrani Sugathadasa, the Chairperson of the Insurance Board of Sri Lanka and Damayanthi Fernando, the Director General of the IBSL answered some queries about the insurance community of the country.?
Speaking about the rectification of the low public image of today?s insurance advisor, the Chairperson of the IBSL stated, ?The industry must take the lead to emphasize the importance of the role of an insurance advisor in providing protection to people.?
Further the job of an advisor remains a lucrative job if properly carried out. Therefore, the companies must undertake grooming sessions to better the outlook of advisors. The individual insurance advisor in Sri Lanka, as is in many other countries predominantly procures the insurance business.? As such the image of the insurance advisor is very important and it is this image that should be projected by the Insurance Industry at as many forums as possible and to this effect the individual Insurance companies must not only brand their products but their people as professionals in their chosen profession. Attracting the best talent by providing not only monetary incentives, but training and development is also key in this aspect of attracting better qualified and suited candidates to the industry?.
?As the regulator, our mandate is limited to determining the minimum qualifications of persons who wish to become registered Insurance advisors, rates of commission to be paid to them and setting standards via guidelines. These actions are implemented and managed successfully through the Sri Lanka insurance Institute and the registered insurance companies that are supervised and monitored by the IBSL?, explained Sugathadasa when questioned about the manner in which the IBSL provides technical support to insurance advisors.?
Sugathadasa was also keen to discuss a number of steps to be taken in order to improve the standard of the insurance services in Sri Lanka. ?This is a continuous process. The quality of Insurance arrangements and the practices employed by market participants are sound in that they see to a continuous improvement in service standards. The Insurance Board is also keen to implement some of the world?s best practices when it comes to improving the current standards of the industry and to this effect we have brought in many tried and tested methods in how we engage and do business to the Sri Lankan Insurance industry?.?
In relation to the declaration of the 1st of September as National Insurance Day and the Insurance Awareness Month campaign, the Chairperson of the IBSL said, ?It progressed very well with several pre-arranged campaigns and talk shows etc. All in all this should end with as a very successful initiative to take the industry forward. To support this effort by the Insurance Association of Sri Lanka, the IBSL actively participated in some of the regional activations that took place across the island and engaged with stakeholders in taking the message of Insurance to the masses?.
?Fernando, the Director General of the IBSL was asked to explain her observations in regard to the Insurance Awareness Month activities and she warmly commended the efforts of all those responsible in the organization of the campaign stating, ?The activities that were carried out during Insurance Awareness Month will provide a great boost for the development of the Insurance industry. The campaign has created greater awareness among the public about the importance of Insurance, whether it be life or non-life. I also witnessed the commitment and enthusiasm of the Insurance Association of Sri Lanka (IASL) and all those involved, in order to create greater awareness about the industry.?
As 1st of September was marked as ?National Insurance Day?, it also signifies the government?s commitment to develop the Insurance industry of Sri Lanka. In the cities where IBSL officials took part we saw the insurance industry come together as one force and one voice, irrespective of the companies they represent, to ensure that as an industry, we take the message of Insurance to all. I see this as a very good endeavor to reach the goal of the insurance industry, ?a day when all Sri Lankan?s are insured?.??

Is ageing a boon or a burden?
	
Sri Lanka experienced a dramatic increase in life expectancy which is attributed to the developments in the health sector, during the past few years. This achievement also brings with it a challenge; an ageing population. However, it?s certain that the country will have to face certain consequences in this regard.??
According to the findings of the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), there are around 2.5 million people in Sri Lanka who are above the age of 60 years. It?s projected that by 2030, 1 in 5 people will be in this category.??
With the purpose of generating a social discussion on the issue, the UNFPA recently organized a Generation-to-Generation dialogue on the theme ?Ageing Population in Sri Lanka and its Policy Implications? at the Cinnamon Grand, Colombo. The event was graced by UNFPA Regional Director for Asia Pacific Bjorn Anderson, who was in country on a five-day mission.?
Addressing the gathering, Anderson said that the organization is committed to ensure that the discourse on ageing shifts from focusing on the cost and burden of ageing in Sri Lanka.??
At the dialogue, a thematic report on Population Ageing in Sri Lanka, jointly published by UNFPA and Department of Census and Statistics (DCS), was disseminated. The first copy of this report was presented on October 1, to the Minister of Social Empowerment, Welfare, and Kandyan Heritage, S.B Dissanayake, at the National Event marking International Day of?Older Persons.
The panel, discussing the report, comprised of the Author of the Report, Dr. Sunethra Perera ? Head of Department of Demography, University of Colombo; Ms. Ritsu Nacken - UNFPA Representative in Sri Lanka; Dr. Harischandra Yakandawala - Director (Medical) of the Family Planning Association of Sri Lanka; Dr. Shiromi Maduwage - National Programme Officer, Elderly Care, Ministry of Health and Ms. Piyumi Fonseka - Journalist, Daily Mirror, Wijeya Newspapers Sri Lanka. The discussion was moderated by Dr. Amara Satharasinghe - Director General, Department of Census and Statistics (DCS).??
?
?If the current authorities don?t take right precautions, the ageing population will be a huge burden?
Dr. Amara Satharasinghe, Director General, DCS
?The ageing population in our country is an achievement of humanity. We have invested a lot in education and health systems to achieve this status amidst much struggle, since the post Independence era. The age at which a person starts receiving retirement benefits is the cut off age. This is the age at which we recognize a person to be old. In Sri Lanka, we all know that this cut off age is 60.? ?
The proportion of the Sri Lankan elderly population is the highest in South Asia. Nevertheless, this issue isn?t limited to South Asia. Even Singapore is intending to focus on this issue in their next development plan. The falling fertility rates and decreasing mortality rates in the country has caused a rise in the elderly population.?
Sri Lanka is conducting population and housing census once in ten years. The last census was conducted in 2012; therefore the country has to wait until 2022 to survey its demographic profile. Considering the fact that the waiting period for another census is too long, our department has decided to conduct a mini census once in two years.?
When a country is working to achieve sustainable development goals, all the groups of the society, including the elderly, should be taken into consideration. If the current authorities don?t take the right precautions, the ageing population will be a huge burden to the country,?said?Dr. Satharasinghe.?
?
?Population ageing isn?t a problem, but an achievement and a celebration of humanity?
Bjorn Anderson, UNFPA Regional Director for Asia Pacific
?As Mr. Satharasinghe said, population ageing isn?t a problem, but an achievement and a celebration of humanity which comes with a range of opportunities. We need to embrace those opportunities. It demonstrates that people of a country are happier, healthier and generally having their living standards. We need to discuss the demographic shifts, causes and implications. Finding holistic and pragmatic policy solutions is an integral aspect of this process.
Health and active ageing can?t be achieved through a single initiative. It requires a range of policy shifts and actions. UNFPA is committed to being part of the effort to ensure that the discourse on ageing shifts from focusing on the cost and burden of ageing. UNFPA supports countries to recognize the enormous contribution that older persons can make in sustainable development,? said Anderson.?
?
?Not only doctors, we need more human resources in many categories?
Dr. Shiromi Maduwage, National Programme Officer, Elderly Care, Ministry of Health
?We have already set up policies and recommendations on how to address the ageing population issue. But, to our disappointment, all the recommendations are pilled up in cupboards. I believe that it?s high time for us to act. Programme planners should make the policy shifts and recommendations in a more practical way.? ?There is a suggestion to increase retirement age. But, it can?t be done overnight because it requires a lot of research.? ?
The Health Ministry is currently in the process of collecting data to observe the readiness of our health system to face the ageing population issue. A lot of preparations should be made in the health sector. We have already taken measures to increase facilities in hospitals in terms of human resources and infrastructure. Recently, we introduced a national policy for the senior citizens.??
At the moment, the country doesn?t have a special group of medical officers to treat elderly patients. Not only doctors, we need more human resources in many categories. The Health Ministry has identified what should be done and what?s being done at the moment,?Dr. Maduwage said.?
?
?Sri Lanka can learn a?lot from Japan?
Ritsu Nacken, UNFPA Representative in Sri Lanka
?There is a lot to learn from Japan on how Sri Lanka should address the ageing population issue. The definition of older people has changed in Japan now. As such, the people aged above 65 years are recognized as the elderly in Japan. It was 60 few years ago.? ?
At present,? the population of ?older persons? in Sri Lanka is 26%. It is projected that this percentage will rise to 40% by 2040. The fertility rate has been around 1.4 in Japan, causing the ageing to accelerate.
One of the best reforms made by Japan was introducing long term care and insurance for the elderly. Just like in Sri Lanka, in Japan too children, particularity women, were supposed to take care of their old parents. With the time, we realized that the system wasn?t sustainable and a different system should be set up. A new position named ?care manager? was introduced, so that decisions could be taken when caring for the elderly.?
?
?I think we need to set up mechanisms in order to address ageing related issues?
Dr. Sunethra Perera, Head of Department of Demography, University of Colombo
?The first step is to create public awareness about the positive aspect of ageing. I think we also need to set up mechanisms in order to address ageing related issues including feminization of ageing and employment. We need to see whether we are ready to face implications that would rise due to population ageing. The authorities should consider improving geriatric services in the country,?said Perera.
?
?
?There is concern regarding the older population suffering from mental disease?
Dr. Harischandra Yakandawala, Director (Medical) of the Family Planning Association of Sri Lanka
?As the country hasn?t recognized positive impacts of ageing, I think it is a burden for the country at the moment. There should be a separate programme by the Government targeting older people of the country. While there is an increase in Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs) among the elderly, there is concern regarding the older population suffering from mental disease.???
?
?
?There is a need for the media to show more respect to older members of the community?
Ms. Piyumi Fonseka, Journalist, Daily Mirror, Wijeya Newspapers
?The media has a strong and pervasive impact on views regarding older people. It is a reality that increasing ageing population poses challenges to the society, but at the same time we shouldn?t forget the unique opportunities that it may provide.?
Ageism is a social disease fed by stereotypes. These stereotypes matter because people act on the stereotypes and the assumptions that are harbored about older people. I believe that the elderly are severely under-represented in many types of advertisements and in other media.?
There is scope for the media to assist in the breakdown of these stereotypes. There is a need for the media to actively break down stereotypes, particularly those to do with health and victimization.? ? Further, there is a need for the media to show more respect to older members of the community and to provide images and messages which strengthen the contribution that older people make to Sri Lanka. Media and marketing companies, including film, news, television and publishing, can increase the prevalence and diversity of older adults represented in their offerings. This visibility will send a strong message.?

Malwatte Mahanayake Thera out of the country: PM
	
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe today charged that there is a move to mislead the public with regard to the statement issued by the Joint Karaka Sabha of Asgiriya and Malwathu chapters as the Mahanayake Thera of the Malwatte Chapter is not even in the country.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe who made this remark just after accepting a report on a research carried out on the new constitution by the Sri Lanka College of Journalism and several other organizations at the Parliamentary complex last morning.
'One of the gentlemen gathered here said there are allegations with regard to the new constitution. Who is making those allegations? Look at the newspapers today. They are carrying a story saying the most venerable Maha Nayaka Theras are against the new constitution. I spoke to venerable Maha Nayaka Thera of the Malawathu chapter. He is out of the country at the moment. I spoke to him today. Therefore how can the media carry his picture? How can media mislead the public in this manner? The draft of the constitution is yet to be made. Will you give front page headlines for my story as well? You went ?Kade? for Rajapaksas once. Do you have to do it again," he said.

Meteor explosion cause for bright light, sound in SP - Prof. Jayaratne
	
Colombo University Physical Science Department Prof. Chandana Jayaratne confirmed that the bright light and sound which was heard from the Southern Province (SP) this evening was because of an explosion caused by a meteor.
Speaking to the Daily Mirror he said the explosion was known as a 'fireball explosion' and occurs after an astroid enters the earth?s atmosphere.
?The astroid could be a size of 50 centimetres. Every astroid enters the earth?s photosphere at a speed of 65 kilometers per second. With that speed one side of the astroid gets heated up due to friction and the other side does not, therefore causing an explosion,? Prof Jayaratne said.
?People who saw the asteroid entering our atmosphere at about 8.30p.m, saw different colour lights. Most of it was green and yellow due to its elements reacting to the heat,? he said.
?The explosion could have caused damage, but fortunately it broke into small pieces. People should not touch parts of the astroid because those astroid can contain radiation which cause harm to the human body and my contains unknown bacteria,? he warned.
The light of the astroid was seen in several parts of the country including the Southern Province.
Military Spokesman and Army Media Director Roshan Seneviratne, said they were yet to detect any incidents caused by the light. The Sri Lanka Navy and Air Force also confirmed that they did not detect any incidents. (Chaturanga Pradeep)

No freedom of expression as bragged: SLPP
	
The Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) said today, Anika Wijesuriya, a key witness in the Bond investigation had left the country due to death threats though the government said it had enabled an environment where anyone could criticize anyone without being subjected to intimidation.
SLPP Chairman Prof. G.L. Peiris said if it was not for Ms. Wijesuriya, the leasing out of penthouse by Arjun Aloysius in which former finance minister?s family resided in would not have come to light.
?This was a significant part of the investigation into Bond scam. A close relative of former minister Ravi Karunanayake had phoned and threatened the witness with death. In reality, sprats can be criticized but not sharks. When a shark is criticized, people receive death threats,? he told a news briefing.
He said the counsel of the Attorney General?s Department had bravely questioned and cross-examined all personnel who arrived at the Commission except for Ministers Kabir Hashim and Malik Samarawickrama.
?The two ministers were not questioned at all by the AG?s counsel. Asking brave questions revealed the truth about the Bond scam. When questions are not asked, it will affect the investigations. It is hard to think that the entire truth will be revealed now,? he said.
He said Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe should also be questioned without being given a questionnaire to answer them in way of an affidavit.
Meanwhile, he said the police in the Northern Province is operated by the Tamil National Alliance (TNA). ?The TNA, being the Opposition in Parliament, helps the government in delaying elections and the government rewards the TNA in return,? he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

October Revolution marked a new epoch in world history
	
Centenary Celebrations ( 1917-2017)
The October Revolution was the first major attempt to create a society free from class exploitation. It was the first successful revolution by workers, peasants and other exploited sections to establish a new society.??
The October Revolution in Russia marked a new epoch in world history. It created the first socialist state -- the Soviet Union. Pre-revolutionary Russia was controlled by the Tsarist monarchy. This presided over the whole of Central Asia. Large tracts of land were owned by landowners, and factories and the mining industry was owned by a?few monopolies.??
The Europeans were entangled in a war to colonise the world. Russia too, was involved in the first world war in 1914. The Russian Tsar sent thousands of people to the battle front. Russia began losing the war with Germany. Death and hunger was widespread. This gave rise to mass discontent among the ordinary people. The Bolshevik party launched an insurrection against Tsarist rule. This resulted in Tsarist rule being replaced by a bourgeois-dominated government. Some social democratic parties were also represented.
This took place in February 1917, and the provisional government began looking into the interests of a few rich people and landowners.? ?
The February revolution had also given rise to a new form of peoples organization:the soviets. Soviets of workers, soldiers and peasants sprang up in all major cities and in rural areas. The Bolshevik Party became very popular among the worker soviets and armed forces.
The provisional government became very unpopular by the end of September. Many soviets in Petrograd and Moscow formed armed detachments to defend the ongoing changes. The peasants took over land from the landowners. Soldiers in the army had elected their own soviets. They were calling for an end to the war.??
The changes in the Russian society was well understood by the leader of the Bolshevik Party, V.I. Lenin. He said that power should be transferred from the first stage of bourgeois revolution to the next stage of workers and peasants. This gave rise to the formation of a Revolutionary government headed by V.I. Lenin with the Council of?peoples Commissars.
The masses rallied around the Bolshevik Party for Peace, bread and land. The first step taken by the new government was to place a decree on land. The land decree adopted took over all landed estates and all lands of church and monastery with their livestock, implements and buildings and placed them under the authority of local land committees and soviets of peasants deputies. The decree on peace called for an end to the war with immediate peace negotiations between all governments and peoples involved in the war.??
?
"The Europeans were entangled in a war to colonise the world. Russia too, was involved in the first world war in 1914. "
Other decrees were on the elimination of illiteracy , for universal primary education , provision of free medical health care and creation of the new Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. (USSR). The Russian Revolution liberated various non-Russian nationalities from the colonial yoke and gave them an autonomous setup as Socialist Republics within the Union.? Recital of a poem at the gathering of Peoples commissars:??
?
?You fell in the fatal fight, For the liberty of the people, For the honour of the people,? ?
You gave up your lives and everything dear to you, you suffered in horrible prisons , You went to exile in chains,? ?
?Without a word you carried your chains because you could not ignore your suffering, brothers, because you believed justice is stronger than the sword??????????
?The time will come when your surrendered life will count,That time is near; When tyranny falls the people will rise, great and free!??
?Farewell brothers, you chose a noble path, You are followed by the new and fresh army ready to die and to suffer???????
?Farewell brothers, You chose a noble path, At your grave we swear to fight, to work for freedom and the peoples happiness?.???
(Ten Days that shook the world ? John Reed)??
Before the Soviet state could start on building socialism it had to face a counter- revolution. A bitter civil war erupted.The Red Army had to fight the white guards and the counter-revolutionary forces. Ten capitalist countries including Britain, France, Germany and the USA supported counter-revolutionary forces with money and weapons.? ?
After four years of fighting the civil war the Red Army finally crushed the reactionary forces . Some of the finest comrades were killed in the battle front. Thousands of class-conscious workers and peasants sacrificed their lives .? ?
The October Revolution was the first time in history the working class and its allies like the poor peasantry -- the exploited classes -- led a revolution to overthrow the ruling bourgeois and the exploiting classes. Lenin had stated that a revolution is successful only when the old state power is smashed and a new form of state power is established. This is what happened in the Russian Revolution which dismantled the old state power and put in place a new state In the form of Soviets which represents the interests of the workers and poor peasants.?
The world before 1917 was very different from what it is today. The beginning of the 20th century was dominated by empires. The British and Americans , the French, the Austro-Hungarian, Russians and Japanese dominated and divided the world.The lesser empires such as Italy and Portugal had fewer colonies. The bulk of the world population lived in colonies subject to these empires.? ?
The Russian Revolution put an end to the old-style colonialism. The October Revolution sparked off the chain of National Liberation struggles which overthrew colonial rule. The struggle against imperialism reached a higher plane with the success of the socialist revolution. The national liberation movements in Asia, Africa and Latin America drew their inspiration from the Russian Revolution and the Soviet Union lent its support to the national liberation struggles.??
?
"Nearly 27 million Soviet people lost their lives in defeating fascism. It was the Red Army which spearheaded the smashing of the Nazi war machine"
The ?October Revolution? was based on the revolutionary strategy of the worker-peasant alliance . This strategy was well used by the national liberation movements to be free from colonial exploitation. Following these footsteps, three decades later the Chinese Revolution took place under the guidance of the Communist Party of China. This was followed by revolutions in Vietnam and Korea. All these revolutions were direct descendants of the worldwide anti-imperialist and anti-fascist struggles which developed in the 1930s.?
The defeat of the greatest evil of the 20th century, that of fascism, was mainly due to the existence and the struggles waged by the Soviet Union. Nearly 27 million Soviet people lost their lives in defeating fascism. It was the Red Army which spearheaded the smashing of the Nazi war machine. The victory of Soviet Union cost the imperialist countries their colonial legacy. Many colonial pundits came and brought reforms so that the colonies do not breakaway from them and develop relationship with the Soviet Union.? ?
The end of WW II saw a new alignment of nations. The Soviet Union was thrown into an arms race by the western countries led by USA. This resulted in huge nuclear arsenals and stockpiling them in third countries. The Soviet Union dismantled its military alliance, the Warsaw Pact, and also worked with the USA in dismantling nuclear weapons.?
Although the Soviet Union kept its promises,the agreements made by US presidents had not been fulfilled. The US presidents? promises not to sell advanced weapons to eastern Europe or draw them into NATO has not been fulfilled. Instead many hotspots have been created in the Ukraine, Georgia, and Estonia, which are states bordering Russia. Many economic and trade embargoes are placed on Russia.? ?
When Russia celebrates its centenary of the Russian Revolution, we salute them for their historic contribution to mankind.? ? ?

Higher Education Minster Lakshman Kiriella told Parliament today that President Maithripala Sirisena will reveal the government stance on SAITM on Monday.
He said the government was prepared for any solution with regard to the SAITM other than abolishing it.
He told parliament that if the anti-SAITM protesters agreed to resolve the SAITM issue without causing any injustice to its students, the government was ready to resolve it.
In response to a question raised by Joint Opposition MP Dinesh Gunawardane on the government stance regarding the request made by the Mahanayake Theras, the minister said the government was in discussion with the Theras.
He said the government had already carried out most of the recommendations made by professionals including the deans of the medical faculties.
"We have had several rounds of discussions with parties concerned on the SAITM issue. We have taken over the Neville Fernando Teaching Hospital, suspended the admission of new students and we were taking steps to Gazette the minimum standards as demanded by the professionals," he said.
Mr. Kiriella said Dinesh Gunawardane, who submitted the gazzete in parliament authorizing the SAITM, should apologise to the Mahanayake Theras for misleading them. (Ajith Siriwardana and Yohan Perera)

He said Mr. Ekanayaka had instructed the commission to grant a pay hike under the circular 6/2006.
?During the previous strike, we demanded the Railways Department to increase the salary scale of Engine Drivers, Guards, Station Masters and Controllers to MP1 and MP2 categories,? he said.
Mr. Ekanayaka has told the commission to assign a pay hike within one month starting from September 20. He said this decision was given during the previous 48-hour train strike.
?The one month duration will come to an end on Friday. The only decision taken by the commission is assigning employees to a category which has a salary lower than the specified basic salary,? Mr. Ariyaratne said. (Chaturanga Pradeep)

Ravindra Randeniya: Reflections on a frown
	
What makes Ravindra Randeniya stand out, what makes him, at the end of the day, Ravindra Randeniya, is his contemplative frown. You see that frown creep up everywhere, in almost every picture he?s in. It turns him, in varying degrees, into a meticulous detective, a pained lover, a mistrustful husband, even a compulsive trickster or conman or womaniser. The reason why he embodies all these characters, and their qualities, is because he?s so versatile; not the way Joe Abeywickrama or Tony Ranasinghe were, but in a less empathetic way. He is the only actor from here that I can think of who can frown in both a commercial and a serious movie and get away with it.?
Randeniya is at his best, and his least empathetic, when he conceals his intentions with that frown. He is the great concealer, and is in fact so good at this role that nearly every other role is a variation of it. Not until the end of Duhulu Malak, the first real film he was in after supporting roles in a series of at best preparatory pictures, do we realise he is no more, and no less, than an irresponsible, prodigal playboy.
We think he?s such an unlikeable womaniser but he?s not. (At the very end he throws his shoe, in frustration, to the sea, and in that act he is both resentful and upbeat about the fact that he?s lost his woman.) What conceals those intentions is his sense of debonair grace, which is so debonair that he can hide the vilest intentions of his characters with his charm.?
That explains why Maya, Dadayama, Sagara Jalaya, and Anantha Rathriya work so well when he?s around: he?s so good at talking, at faking, but we believe him along with the (for the most) female protagonists, who in all these movies happened to be Swarna Mallawarachchi. When Rathmali from Dadayama has her illusions about the man who impregnated her twice and left her shattered, she threatens him and writes him a letter; when they meet the next time, he is flippantly ominous about her missive: ?Who are you to post letters ordering me? Who are you to boss me around??
In the sequences that preceded this encounter, however, he is so charming, so apologetic about what he?s done to this woman, that both Rathmali and the audience know that she has every right to be intimidating and threatening towards him: because of his debonair grace he?s become a part of her, and all those dreams of hers about him are derived from that quality of his.? ?
?
"Randeniya is at his best, and his least empathetic, when he conceals his intentions with that frown. "
Because he can be two people at the same time ? sometimes for the better (as with Chuda Manikye, Siripala Saha Ranmenika, and to a certain extent, Sagara Jalaya), and often for the worst (Dadayama, Bhava Duka and Bhava Karma, and Roy de Silva?s Sudu Piruvata) ? people choose to believe in the latter, which more or less indicates that we?re cynical enough to be swayed by villains. But Randeniya is not only a villain, though in the he was so typecast that he was thought fit to play no one else. In Vijaya Dharma Sri?s Aradana, which was almost a Dadayama turned the other way around, yielding a happy resolution and ending, he goes after the woman he befriended (Malini Fonseka) to reclaim her. There?s a Ravindra Randeniya that exists beyond all this too.?
He was born Boniface Perera in Dalugama, Kelaniya on June 5, 1945 to a successful mudalali family. A self-made businessman, his father initially put his son into St Francis?s School, run by the Dalugama Church. Two years later, he was admitted to St Benedict?s College, Kotahena. This is where he was initiated into his first love: literature. His tastes at the time ? Martin Wickramasinghe with Gorky,
Dostoyevsky, and Chekhov ? wildly diverged from those of his classmates, who preferred easier-to-digest pulp fiction from that era and teased him for his own preferences. It was a largely vernacular backdrop which greeted him at St Benedict?s, despite the fact that it was, all in all, a missionary school. ?There was only one period for English,? he remembered for me, ?During all other periods, we talked freely in Sinhala, though we had Tamil and Burgher and even Muslim friends. Race and religion didn?t matter. Not to us.?? ?
What he read, he remembered, had for some time turned him into a leftist: ?Everyone?s a socialist at 20!? was how he reflected on it for me. Surprisingly though, none of these encounters got him to act. Apart from a Fifth Standard production of Sigiri Kashyapa, in which he was Kashyapa, he never acted at all. His first real initiation into his profession would therefore come from an outsider:
Dhamma Jagoda, who with Sugathapala de Silva was openly spurning Ediriweera Sarachchandra?s stylised conception of the theatre. One thing led to another, and soon enough, he was studying at the Lionel Wendt Theatre Workshop, which Jagoda had founded after returning to Sri Lanka from an American tour. ?He brought Method Acting to this country, in fact. He had been to the Actors? Studio, he had met Elia Kazan and Strasberg, and he had seen Marlon Brando.??
Jagoda had taken it upon himself to preach Strasberg?s gospel in the country, and Randeniya had obviously come under his influence. He had not, however, entered the Workshop to study acting at all, rather screenwriting, directing, stage decor. ?Somehow or the other, I found myself in an acting class. I had by this time been drawn to the whole idea of becoming a performer, instead of remaining backstage.
That was also a common class: whether or not you had chosen the subject, you had to attend it for at least one or two hours.? The course lasted for two years, and Randeniya found himself being dragged into various roles and performances. His first production as such had been Gunasena Galappaththy?s Muhudu Puththu, controversial for its time owing to its depiction of adultery, but a culmination of sorts to everything he and his colleagues had learnt.? ?
Muhudu Puththu had been a success; among those who thronged that night at the Wendt was the filmmaker and the iconoclast, Manik Sandrasagara, who after congratulating Randeniya?s performance insisted on taking him to his first movie, Kalu Diya Dahara (1970). Kalu Diya Dahara was another success; having watched it and been impressed by his portrayal of an estate labourer, another filmmaker came around, congratulated him, and took him aboard his next film.
The director was Lester James Peries, the film, released two years later and lukewarmly received, was Desa Nisa. No two directors could have been more different. Randeniya himself was warm about both: ?Manika had a way of asserting himself. Dr Peries never asserts himself. In fact you never feel that he?s there overseeing you.? In Desa Nisa he was a morally ambiguous hermit, able to restore sight or stunt it at his will. It was followed by Duhulu Malak (1976), another hit.??
None of these movies really ?awakened? the thespian in him. That would come a year later, in 1977, with Amaranath Jayatilake?s Siripala Saha Ranmenika, where he starred for the first time opposite Malini Fonseka and which took him back to a role which would creep up in the years to come: Samson, the Sinhalised version of Stanley Kowalski, from Ves Muhunu, Dhamma Jagoda?s adaptation of A Streetcar Named Desire. ?To become Siripala I had to become bestial, almost inhumane. It was the same story with Samson.
? When we were young we were horrified when Kowalski (Samson, by the way, had first been portrayed by Jagoda himself, in 1963) jeers at Blanche DuBois; when we grew up, we realised that it was his way of asserting the truth, that Blanche was, in fact, a pretender, and that her gentility never rubbed off on an animalistic brute like him. It was that kind of animalistic brute, who never cares for affection and never even once feels sorry for anyone other than those who are closest to him ? he doesn?t even care for himself ? which is embodied in his subsequent, villainous performances.
That they are among the best of their kind indicated, quite clearly, that he had found his signature.?
There were of course other characters, other films: as Migara in The God King (1975); as a modern-day Rama in Sita Devi (1978); as the hero in Weera Puran Appu (1979); as the brother-in-law of Swarna Mallawarachchi in Sagara Jalaya (1988); as the troubled protagonist in Anantha Rathriya (1996), as the nouveau rich mudalali Lionel in Wekanda Walawwa (2005). In the first three movies he?s a beleaguered hero, and in the latter three he?s a beleaguered antihero.
In Weera Puran Appu, which was made as an epic that dwelt on sharply and clearly defined heroes and villains, he was clear, concise, and direct. But as the cousin in Sagara Jalaya, by contrast, he leaves us in the dark.? ?
And what makes this sense of indirectness, obliqueness, is that we are never entirely sure as to whether he?s going to stick to his word: he?s a talker, a consoler, but also a concealer. With one set of characters he?s a different man. (You see this in Dadayama, where to his fianc?e, played by Shirani Kaushalya, he is the perfect lover; he is anything but to the woman he impregnates, who demands at the end that he suffer for what he?s done to her.) It?s a call for condemnation, and his Priyankara Jayanath is so despicable that Regi Siriwardena, in an otherwise laudatory review, called him ?a solid, if less complex, character portrayal.? That was who his villains were, at the end of the day: solid, despicable, hateful, and one-dimensional. What made them all multidimensional and stand out, as I observed before, was that deceptively contemplative frown.? ?

## Title: ?WHO? said that Sri Lanka?s suicide rate hasn?t dropped?

?WHO? said that Sri Lanka?s suicide rate hasn?t dropped?
	
Lending an ear is all it takes to save a life!? ?
As life goes on, various barriers are thrown at its path. Some challenges may be easy to meet while others may demand an extra effort to overcome.?
In the heat of frustration, when one is unable to think clearly, a wrong decision might be made. This is the story behind every deliberate attempt to end a life. Problems can push us to our limits. Sharing our worries is the key to coping up with burdens. Listening to someone?s troubles is the door to saving a life!??
Over the years there has been much scrutiny about Sri Lanka?s ?increasing? suicide rate. However statistics reveal that in reality the suicide rate has been rapidly descending. The Daily Mirror? approached specialists in various fields to discuss this issue under different perspectives, to create awareness about suicide and accentuate the value of life.? ?
?It?s common in our part of the world to consider psychiatric problems as a sign of failure?
- Dr. Lushan Hettiarachchi
A person?s mental health and suicide are always co-related. Dr. Lushan Hettiarachchi, Consultant Forensic Psychiatrist of the National Institute of Mental Health, Angoda, spoke to the?on the factors that lead to a mentality which harbours suicidal thoughts. ?Mental disorders, substance use disorders, personality styles predispose a person to commit suicide,? he warned.? ?
Mental disorders are one of the main reasons that give rise to suicidal attempts. ?Depression is the most significant cause leading to suicidal thoughts. Depression is very common. One in four people suffer from depression. It will be the leading morbidity in near future.? Dr. Hettiarachchi stated.
?Sudden loss of expectations, desperation and frustration, loss of a loved one, relationship breakups and exam failures also contribute to suicidal thoughts,? said Dr. Hettiarachchi.? ?Media portraits given on suicides too have made a significant contribution towards the increase in suicidal ideations and attempts. According to him some reports promote suicidal behaviour rather than discouraging such acts.
?It is common in our part of the world to consider psychiatric problems as signs of failure. Hence, people may be reluctant to seek help. Sri Lankans don?t talk about their mental and emotional issues, especially men. Suicide is more common among men. Western reports state that incidents of suicide are higher in the 15-25 age group. This is no different in Sri Lanka,? said Dr. Hettiarachchi.?
Mental health literacy is not satisfactory in Sri Lanka. People are not aware of how to recognise a problem or where they could obtain help and services. ?It?s wise to seek help from a qualified doctor when you have a problem. Doctors can assess your problem and recommend treatment or management plans,? advised Dr. Hettiarachchi.?
?If suicidal ideation arises due to trivial problems, that a person faces in day today life, then the person may benefit from counselling. Counselling should focus on problem solving and endurance,? he said. Most of the General and Base hospitals have qualified experts to handle these situations.?
?People should have a clear idea that help is available. Service providers should be non-judgmental yet be empathetic towards the problem. The person suffering should be given hope. Currently these messages are given to general public through posters, newspaper articles and awareness programs. There are few befriending telephone lines available for any person to call free of charge at any time of the day,? Dr. Hettiarachchi elaborated.?
Making a rational decision on how to face a critical situation, from where and whom we can seek help when having a problem, conflict resolution and assertiveness etc are some skills that need to be taught early in school life, Dr. Hettirachchi went on to state.?
?
?Sri Lanka is recognized globally for having reduced its suicides by 70% but this is not much known or appreciated within our country!??
-? Nalaka Gunawardene
Nalaka Gunawardene, science writer and media researcher, aired his views on the connection between social media and suicide. ?Humans are complex beings who are exposed to multiple factors. There simply isn?t research evidence yet to show that the rising use of social media is contributing to suicide deaths in Sri Lanka,?said Gunawardene.?
?It is very difficult to determine a specific causative factor or phenomenon of suicide. Researchers say that it?s an accumulation of factors that increases an individual?s vulnerability to suicide.? he continued.? ?
He further said that we need to be very careful in exposing the link between a particular factor and a person?s suicide.?
Citing the statistics he said, ?Sri Lanka has experienced major changes in its suicide rates since the 1970s, and by 1995 it had one of the highest rates in the world. There were 8,514 reported suicide deaths that year, but since then it has come down significantly: there were 3,025 suicide deaths reported in 2016. Having peaked at 57 suicides per 100,000 people in the 1990s, the latest rate is 17 per 100,000?.?
??Sri Lanka is recognized globally for having reduced its suicides by 70%, but this isn?t much known or appreciated within our country!? he added.?
?
?Mental isolation has become the aftermath of technology and modernization?
- Prof. Daya Amarasekera
Prof. Daya Amarasekera of the Sociology Department, University of Peradeniya, when contacted said that social issues provide the base for suicidal issues. ?Today Sri Lanka is identified as a modernizing nation. Mental isolation has become the aftermath of technology and modernization, that dominates our lives. Though we may be surrounded by many faces, people still feel isolated within,? he said.?
The professor explained that lives have become more centred on gaining wealth, power and status. ?Education is one certain aspect that verifies the competitiveness that exists in society. From the grade 5 scholarships to higher education in Universities, students are placed under pressure. The inability to succeed in achieving their goals and getting left out, results in emotional conflict in these young minds,? he stressed.?
Prof. Amarasekera went on to say that the internet and various media have misled audiences to engage in inappropriate behaviour and misconduct. This has resulted in luring the youth towards wrong doings.
As a solution to reducing the risk of suicide attempts, the most important thing is to strengthen human relationships and prevent mental isolation. ?Social relationships have to be strengthened. An undeniable gap exists between parents and children. In schools, teachers and students have to share a close relationship. The teachers should develop a relationship that is open and friendly; one that allows easy communication with students,? the professor explained.? ?
?
?Although the rate has dropped the attempts at suicide are still very high??
-- Sumithrayo
Speaking to Sumithrayo, an organization focussed on suicide prevention, the Daily Mirror learned that the suicide rates aren?t increasing, but in fact decreasing.
?There have been recurring suicides in the past few months, but when you look at the Police Department Statistics the rate has dropped. Even though, according to the WHO we are the 4th highest when it comes to suicide, but this is not true. In reality we should be in 22nd or the 24th place.
We are urging them (WHO) to make this change, but the correction is still to be made,? representative from Sumithrayo, who spoke on terms of anonymity, said.? ?Although the rates have dropped the attempts at suicide are still very high. These fact can be observed through hospital records, police records, records held by rural centres and health centres.?
This is due to the preventive measures taken by the Government and also because people have improved greatly. Infrastructure has improved and there is greater awareness in hospitals and in the public and there is also pesticide control etc.? the representative said.?
Speaking of signs that someone who is contemplating would give, the representative said, ?They like to be isolated, are lonely, act in a depressing manner and might be heard saying something like ?I am fed up of life?. We should take the time to listen to people?s problems and help them through this difficult experience,? the Sumithrayo representative added.?
Devoted to responding to people in crisis and preventing suicide, focusing on empathetic active listening and non-judgmental responses, Sumithrayo volunteers endeavour to take every person in crisis seriously. The goal of their befriending is to empower the caller to make life-enhancing choices.
Sumithrayo provides Confidential Emotional Support and is a free service, open 365 days (including holidays) ? from 9 a.m. to 8 p.m. Please call: 011-2692909, 011-2683555 or 011-2696666. Visit: 60B, Horton Place, Colombo 7. Email: sumithra@sumithrayo.org
