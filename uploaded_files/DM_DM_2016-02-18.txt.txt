Arrest me if I did anything wrong: Ven. Uduwe Dhammaloka
	
Ven. Uduwe Dhammaloka Thera, who is presently at the centre of a controversy for allegedly possessing an elephant sans a permit, yesterday challenged the authorities to arrest him if nurturing an elephant calf that had been abandoned in his temple was an unlawful act.
I only nurtured an elephant calf that was abandoned in my temple. If I did something wrong to care for it then take me into custody, the Thera said at a news conference held at the Allen Mathiniyaramaya Temple. Before this I have looked after four elderly fathers, a large number of cats and dogs. The elephant calf is also the same, the thera said.
These remarks were made after a decision was taken by the Attorney General to order the arrest of the prelate. If that were the case the Thera had advised his attorneys to make sure that he would not be sent to the Prison Hospital and said he preferred a regular cell instead. He welcomed donations of Rs.10 from anyone wishing to help which he said should be sent to the temple, as he had no money for legal fees to lawyers if he was arrested. (Jayantha Samarakoon)

In addition to the stress, vehicle users incur huge costs for fuel, ware and tare, as well as for repairs, due to the increasing number of accidents.

Ajith Gunawardena, Chief Executive Officer of Ceylinco General Insurance, commenting on the newest innovation, said: The intention of Ceylinco VIP Express is to provide a convenient, comfortable, economical and punctual office transport system, to and from Greater Colombo areas to the City of Colombo, at a reasonable price, Ceylinco VIP Express will commence daily from Homagama, Panadura, Negombo, Kaduwela and Kadawatha towns, at 6.45am, and will reach Colombo and Fort by 8.10am. And, once again, at 5.30pm in the evening, will leave from Fort/Colombo and will reach the same towns by 6.45pm.
Ceylinco VIP Express will be the latest addition to the long list of benefits enjoyed by Ceylinco VIP On The Spot customers. In 2015, Ceylinco VIP added yet another unique benefit to its long list of value additions, offering an Accidental Health Insurance worth Rs.4 million absolutely free to all Ceylinco VIP On The Spot customers. Amongst the other benefits Ceylinco VIP offers are a similar replacement vehicle, in the event the accident repair exceeds four days, personal accident cover of up to Rs.200,000/- for each passenger, 24/7 emergency roadside assistance, with a 24/7 call centre, the insured value of the vehicle increasing by 10 percent every year, the payment of lease instalments of up to two months in the event of a repair exceeding 30 days, a 10 year warranty for your vehicle against manufacturers defects, valid for the first 10 years from the year of manufacture etc.
Once again, Ceylinco General Insurance sets the benchmark high for the rest of the insurance industry to follow, thereby benefitting the millions of Sri Lankans.

An elephant, found from the residence of former UPFA MP Sajin de Vass Gunawardena in Ambalangoda, was taken into custody by the Wildlife officials and the CID today.
The officials who took the elephant into custody on a court order said the owners failed to submit valid documents to prove the ownership of the animal.
They stated that the 15-year-old elephant had been taken to the Udawalawe elephant transit home.
Sources said the Wildlife Department officials raided the former MPs residence on January 12, 2015 in search of an elephant, and he had then produced a licence to prove the ownership of the elephant.

## Title: Fitch assigns Alliance Finance BB+(lka) rating; Outlook Stable

Fitch assigns Alliance Finance BB+(lka) rating; Outlook Stable
	
Fitch Ratings Lanka has assigned Alliance Finance Company PLC (AFC) a National Long-Term Rating of BB+(lka) with a Stable Outlook.
The agency has also assigned the companys outstanding senior unsecured debentures a National Long-Term Rating of BB+(lka) and its outstanding subordinated debentures a National Long-Term Rating of BB(lka).
AFCs rating reflects its modest franchise, weak asset quality, lower capitalisation and higher risk appetite relative to peers. The rating also captures strengthened management and controls stemming from an on-going organisational restructuring, which Fitch expects to help improve AFCs asset quality through better underwriting. Furthermore, the ratings take into account AFCs adequate profitability.
AFCs exposure to three-wheeled vehicles remains high (37.2 percent of the total loan book at end-September 2016) and Fitch believes that this makes its portfolio more risky compared with that of its peers. The share of motor car financing increased to 19.4 percent at end-September 2016 from 16.5 percent at end-March 2015. The company has also expanded into micro financing (10 percent of the loan book at end-September 2016) after its gold loan book contracted to 4.3 percent at end-September 2016 from 15.6 percent at end-March 2014.
The challenging operating environment and poor management of defaulted loans resulted in a sharp increase in non-performing loans (NPLs) from gold loans and three-wheeler leases in the financial year ended March 2014 (FY14) and FY15. AFCs published regulatory six-month NPL ratio increased to 8.3 percent at FYE15 from 5.6 percent at FYE14 as the company failed to dispose its accumulated repossessed stock in a timely manner.
At end-1HFY16, the NPL ratio improved slightly to 7.9 percent, but still remained above that of its higher-rated peers. The NPL ratio as at end-December 2015 further improved to 5.8 percent, following a disposal of gold and three-wheelers. Nevertheless, Fitch believes that the aggressive expansion of the companys loan book raises the likelihood of further asset-quality and capital deterioration. AFC relies on collateral to mitigate the risk as the unprovisioned portion of its NPLs materially exceeds that of peers.
Fitch views AFCs capitalisation as being weaker relative to higher-rated peers due to its rapid loan growth and lower loan-loss provisioning. Its Tier 1 regulatory capital ratio (at the company level) declined to 10.7 percent in FY15 from 12.8 percent in FY14 despite a capital gain of Rs.193 mn from the sale of the companys stake in Arpico Finance PLC.
AFCs ROA declined to 1.1 percent in FY15 from 1.6 percent in FY14 largely due to significant write-offs of its NPLs in FY15 (96 percent of total impairment charges), which offset the capital gain from the Arpico sale. Rapid branch expansion during the last three years and flat topline growth led to a high cost-to-income ratio relative to peers. Fitch believes that an increase in credit costs could hamper operating profits and internal capital generation in the medium term.
AFC benefits from a modest deposit franchise with deposits accounting for most of its funding (end-1HFY16: 60.5 percent). The company has sourced medium-term funding from both local and foreign financial institutions. Fitch believes that AFC may seek more borrowings to finance its loan book growth, which could help to improve mismatches in its funding profile.
AFCs outstanding senior debentures are rated at the same level as AFCs National Long-Term Rating as they rank equally with the claims of the companys other senior unsecured creditors.

Loon Balloon not a crash: Minister
	
The Googles Loon Balloon which was widely reported as crashed in Gampola had in fact navigated and safe-landed remotely by Googles Loon Centre, Telecommunication and Digital Infrastructure Minister Harin Fernando said.
While addressing the media this morning, the Minister said that the main Air Traffic Control Tower, Google Loon Balloon Centre team in Sri Lanka coordinated the landing procedure.
A team from Google had arrived in the country to test the Loon Balloon operations.
The Minister said the test had created rumors in the country as crash landing of the Google Loon balloon.
He requested the people to not to carry out such rumours and the test landing project of the first Google Loon Balloon was successful.
We have planned to land it in a tea estate in the Gampola area. Those balloons are filled with Helium.
The balloon lands by releasing the gas slowly. When the time it starts to release its gas, the balloon comes down, he explained.
During the last phase of the landing the transmission unit comes down fast as the Helium in the balloon is not enough to carry the units weight, which people see as crash landing, he explained.
Speaking to the Daily Mirror, ICTA Information Infrastructure Programme Manager Gavaskar Subramaniam said the Loon Centre in California launched the safety landing procedure as a part of the testing procedure.
After entering the Sri stratosphere the balloon was hovering over the Southern part of the island.
As the testing procedure by the Google Loon Centre was activated the balloon was remotely navigated and send to the hill country for safe landing, he said.
All data in the balloons unit had been recovered and will be sent to the Google Centre by the ICTA.
Another data backup had also been taken out remotely by the Google Loon Centre before the balloon landed, Gavaskar said.
Another three Loon balloons had already been launched by the California Loon Centre.
One balloon will be entering the Sri Lankan stratosphere within the next few days and the other two balloons will enter within the next thirteen days for coverage testing procedures.
When contacted the Police they had reported a balloon like object had fallen in the Kahagala Watta area in Pupuressa, Gampola last night. (Chaturanga Pradeep, Yohan Perera)

The Colombo additional Magistrate Nishantha Peiris today ascertained that he would consider lifting the restraining order, imposed on former minister Mervyn Silvas son, Malaka preventing him from going into night clubs and behaving indecently in public places, after the parties report any settlement on the matter.
Earlier, the suspect, Malaka Silva was remanded for allegedly assaulting a British National at a Night Club on November 1, 2014.
However, there was a counter case before the court on the brawl that happened between the foreigner and Mr. Silva.
The Magistrate sent a reminder for the third time to the Attorney General over the cases for his opinion, as it had taken very long.
Appearing for Malaka Silva, Counsel Asela Rekawa told the Magistrate that they would like to settle the matter considering the fact that the AGs opinion was pending now for a long time on the matter.
Counsel, Shamendra Rodrigo, who appeared for the British national said he should first get instructions from his client and would report on any settlement on the next date.

Over to you Minister
	
Although efforts are being made to woo more tourists to Sri Lanka by both the Government and the private sector still bitter experiences were being reported sporadically by some foreign tourists travelling in Sri Lanka.
A reader in a letter to the Daily Mirror revealed two of his British friends had to undergo such a bitter experience, while they were in
Sri Lanka.
Two friends of mine visiting from Britain faced an unfortunate incident on the way and had to spend three hours at the Department of Immigration, where they went to get their visa extended for two days, the letter read.
They got into a trishaw on Kinsey Road to get to their destination. The driver, when paid as they came to the end of the journey, said he had no change for Rs. 500 note. The lady got off the trishaw, while her husband drove with the driver, who stopped some distance away and got off, saying he would bring the change.
He stopped in an alley and never returned. My friend waited for about half an hour and thinking his wife would wonder what had happened found his way on foot to the place where his wife had been dropped off.
Inside the Department of Immigration, although a friend had telephoned a contact to help them, they were sent from pillar to post, to various desks before finally they got their visas extended after a wait of three and a half hours.
Apparently, several other tourists were also accorded the same treatment and were heard saying that they would never return to Sri Lanka, the reader said in his letter.
This is hardly the way to woo tourists. There should be a more streamlined method and less red tape to deal with tourists, with a separate section for them.
We hope the Ministry of Tourism will take this matter up with the Immigration Department and see that this kind of thing doesnt happen again.
The Tourist Police should also be on duty outside the Immigration Department to see that tourists were not taken on a ride by unscrupulous trishaw and taxi drivers, the letter said.

PM takes on GMOA, Daily Mirror, Derana
	
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe today rejected allegations made by the Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) that his office had pressurized the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) to carry out investigations against its members and some media organizations.
Making a statement, Mr. Wickremesinghe said the allegation was far from being the truth. He said he had inquired from the police and the latter had informed him that someone had lodged a complaint against the GMOA and they carried out an investigation. He said the police informed him that the complaint they received said a Bill was to be presented to Parliament to amend the Medical Ordinance in line with section 67(A) of 'Establishment of Special Registry and introduction of procedure for foreign medical specialists' which the Prime Minister said was a certain document. The police informed me that no such Bill had been presented to Parliament according to its investigation, he said
The GMOA has accused me of deploying CID officers to spy on its members. The GMOA has no business to get involved in the agreement with India. We asked for a mandate to create employment opportunities when its officers were running behind former President Mahinda Rajapaksa. If the GMOA talks in the way they do I am ready to respond to them politically. They went shopping for the former President. I have facts to prove my point. GMOA President Dr Anuruddha Padeniya met me some time back and they told me not to talk about it. What right do they have to make such a request from me
Mr. Wickremesinghe was also critical of some TV channels, the print media including the Daily Mirror and made the following statement on them
This story on GMOA was carried by the Daily Mirror under the title PMs office pressurized CID. They should have first inquired from the CID. All at the Daily Mirror also went behind Rajapaksa. They belong to him. I am saying one thing. I have given time to adjust according to the new framework. If they cannot adjust Kesara Abeywardene can go home. Derana also started the game yesterday.
Kesara Abeywardena at that time wrote I should leave the party leadership.I have given time for them to correct themselves. If they dont do it Kesara Abeywardene has to go home. We cannot allow this nonsense to continue, Even Derana has started to play games once again. If Derana becomes pro Rajapaksa we will have to disclose all their thefts. They call women bitches. They should discipline themselves. We wont allow anyone to take away the mandate given to us.
People gave us a mandate to create one million jobs, to go for trade agreements. If the Daily Mirror or Derana try to stop our programme of providing employment we will take to the street against them, he added
He said the UNP has been invited to participate in a procession organized by the youth and professionals of the country and the party has accepted it and will take part in it.
The Prime Minister said the government would go ahead with the programme of providing one million employment opportunities and will go for trade agreements with Japan, China, Singapore, and Europe. Anyone could criticize us if we fail in this , he added. (Yohan Perera)

Police promotion gone in five days
	
A mere five- day difference in service has denied promotion to hundreds of Police officers in the Sub-Inspector category because of the decision by the Police Department to extend their service period in the present position to become eligible to be promoted to the next level, Police sources said today.
Earlier, they were required to serve eight years in the current position to become eligible for promotion to the category of Inspector of Police.
However, the Police Department has decided to extend this service period up to 13 years.
According to the new decision, those who completed 13 years by December 26, last year, have become qualified for elevation to the next level as Inspectors of Police (IP).
However, Police sources said there were as many as 400-500 Police officers, who completed their 13 years in service by January 1, 2016, only five days after the deadline stipulated.
This is total injustice. A five-day difference has denied promotion to many Police officers, they said.
It is learnt that these Police officers, aggrieved by the decision, contemplate action to be taken against the move. These officers had urged the Inspector General of Police to review the decision. (KB)
