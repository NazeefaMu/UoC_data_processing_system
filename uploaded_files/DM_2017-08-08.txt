Buck doesnt stop with Ravi: GL
	
It said that there was no doubt that the minister should resign due to the nature of allegations levelled against him, but the responsibility for the scam should be taken by those who hold higher posts as well.
Minister Karunanayake was removed as finance minister and appointed as the foreign minister by the President. That is not all, they readily gave him control over the National and Development Lotteries Boards as well. There is no rational basis for this allocation of subjects. No country has ever created a foreign ministry which handles lotteries boards, former external affairs minister G.L. Peiris told a news conference.
He said this development had created a difficult working situation at the ministry driving away its employees including Foreign Secretary Esala Weerakoon.
He said the no-confidence motion which would be brought against Minister Ravi Karunanayake would have the support of MPs from both the SLFP and UNP who were against corruption.
The no-confidence motion will be a success and a slap in the face of the government. Karunanayake continuing to function as the foreign minister will only bring disgrace to the country. Therefore, his resignation is a must, he said.
However, Professor Peiris warned that any attempt by government higher-ups to shy away from taking responsibility for the scam, by making the foreign minister a scapegoat should be stopped. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

A white-collar one elevated to the status of a Ministry secretary thanks to the blessing of a high political authority only six months on in new office, has made six foreign trips at public expense.

However, he chops in a callous manner the foreign trips his subordinates get for various official purposes.
He has on a number of occasions refused to release qualified employees selected for training courses abroad on flimsy excuses, they say.
On a certain occasion when two employees were offered an opportunity to undergo a training course abroad, the Ministry Secretary had approved the release of only one person saying, Training one person is more than enough!

Erdogan says Turkey to tackle Kurds in Syria
	
REUTERS, 07th AUGUST, 2017- Days after a reshuffle of Turkeys top military commanders, President Tayyip Erdogan has revived warnings of military action against Kurdish fighters in Syria that could set back the U.S.-led battle against Islamic State. Kurdish militia are spearheading an assault against the hardline militants in their Syrian stronghold Raqqa, from where Islamic State has planned attacks around the world for the past three years. 
But U.S. backing for the Kurdish YPG fighters in Syria has infuriated Turkey, which views their growing battlefield strength as a security threat due to a decades-old insurgency by the Kurdish PKK within in its borders. There have been regular exchanges of rocket and artillery fire in recent weeks between Turkish forces and YPG fighters who control part of Syrias northwestern border.

Failure to gazette minimum standards -- GMOA tells Rajitha to resign
	
The GMOA today demanded the resignation of Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne if he failed to gazette the minimum standards for health education by August 14.
It said the minister had assured the people he would do so by August but no steps have been taken so far to issue such a gazette notice.
GMOA Secretary Haritha Aluthge said six months had passed after the Courts directed the minister to prepare the minimum standards for health education but the minister continues to ignore this directive.
Therefore he urged the minister to step down because he had neglected to perform his duties as the minister of health.
Meanwhile, quoting a recent media statement made by the minister, GMOA Assistant Secretary Naveen De Zoysa said they never measured the size of the corruption.
Though the Health Minister describes Foreign Minister Ravi Karunanayakas Penthouse rental as a minor incident, for the GMOA what matters is not the sizebut whether an act was right or wrong, he said. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

Forty-nine Indian fishermen who engaged in illegal fishing activities in Sri Lankan waters were arrested by the Sri Lanka Navy and the Coast Guard on Monday (7) night in the seas off Delft Island and Kovilan Point.
Navy Spokesman Chandima Walakuluge said they had impounded 12 fishing trawlers belonging to the arrested Indian fishermen.
He said fast attack craft attached to the Northern Naval Command and Sir Lanka Coast Guard on routine patrol had arrested the Indian fishermen. Two of the fishing trawlers were impounded in the waters Northwest of Delft Island while the rest were taken into custody in the seas off Kovilan Point, he said.
These fishermen had ventured into Sri Lankan waters and were engaged in illegal bottom trawling which is considered a destructive fishing method, Lieutenant Commander Walakuluge said.
He said the seized trawlers and the fishing gear were brought to the naval base SLNS Elara in Karainagar while the Indian fishermen were brought to the SLNS Uththara in Kankesanthurei. They were to be handed over to the Assistant Fisheries Director in Jaffna for legal action.
Meanwhile, Sri Lanka Navy had facilitated the repatriation of 77 Indian fishermen, who were released from Sri Lankan custody as a gesture of goodwill last week, after detaining them for poaching in the islands territorial waters. (Darshana Sanjeewa)

Govt. pressing for Ravi's resignation
	
In the face of a no-confidence motion against Foreign Affairs Minister Ravi Karunanayake, the government is reported to be urging him to step down rather than face defeat in a vote.
After the motion was handed over by the joint opposition, government members of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) decided to vote in favour of the motion seeking to unseat the minister while a section of the United National Party (UNP) had also decided not to support him if it came to a vote.
Against this backdrop, government leaders believe that it would be humiliating to the entire government if the minister was unseated through a parliamentary process.
Informed sources said both President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe had asked the minister to resign.
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya has called for a party leaders meeting today to discuss future business of the House. JO parliamentary group leader Dinesh Gunawardane said he would seek a date at todays meeting to debate the no-confidence motion against Minister Karunanayake.
However, according to reports the government is determined to push the minister to resign without leaving room for a vote on the motion. (Kelum Bandara)

How battle-ready is India: CAG
	

(Compiled from Hindustan Times), Aug 06, 2017 - Indias Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) has submitted bad news and significantly disturbing findings to Indias parliament about the Indian army. Despite all its bravery, the army is battling with a drastic shortfall of necessary ammunition. 
The report is a follow-up to the conclusions of May 2015. Its objective was to evaluate the progress that has been made over the last three years. The CAG report on ammunition management revealed the situation in September 2016 had not changed very much since March 2013. 
The reason Indian ordnance factories have not improved their output or quality and the procurement process continues to run on the old pattern. The wishlist of weaponry that the army headquarters wanted to acquire which was on the governments files had not been fulfilled even till January 2017. 
The CAG report also says that of the 170 kinds of ammunition in 2013, just 27% was ready for 20 days of intense fighting, while in September 2016, 80% ammunition was below the required levels. The situation has improved only marginally in the months that followed.

Opposition leader Raila Odinga, 72, who lost elections in 2007 and 2013, has already said President Uhuru Kenyatta, 55, can only win if his ruling Jubilee party rigs the vote, a stance that increases the chances of a disputed result and unrest.

No-faith motion: Speaker to rule on Thursday
	
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya yesterday informed Parliament that he would give a ruling on the no-confidence motion against Minister Ravi Karunanayake on Thursday after consulting the Attorney General.
"It is essential to consult the Attorney General because an objection has been raised on the basis that the matter is subjudice," he said.
The Daily Mirror reliably learns that some government members are of the view that the no- confidence motion is subjudice because the inquiry being carried out under Section nine of the Commission of Inquiry Act was similar to that of a case being tried in Court.
The Speaker informed Parliament about his ruling on this matter when joint opposition MP Wimal Weerawansa requested the Speaker to rule on the no-confidence motion.
MP Udaya Gammanpila said the no-confidence motion had nothing to do with the inquiry into the bond scam.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe joining in the cross talk said the Speaker could give his ruling today or tomorrow. "We can take up the motion soon after the Speaker gives his ruling. This government has ensured parliamentary democracy and therefore there is no issue," he said.
Chief Opposition Whip Anura Kumara Dissanayake asked why the no-confidence motion was not included in the parliamentary order books. "Speaker could do so despite the objections raised on the motion's legal validity," he said. (Yohan Perera)

PTL recorded Rs.816 mn profit in 2014: CEO
	
At the time Nivard Cabraal was CB Governor and his sister Shiromi Wickremasinghe a director of PTL
Perpetual Treasuries Ltd., CEO Kasun Palisena giving evidence before the PCoI said today the PTL had made a profit of Rs.816 million in the first six months of secondary market operations.
When questioned by Justice Prasanna Jayawardena it was revealed that during this period Ajith Nivard Cabraal was the CBSL Governor and his sister Shiromi Wickramesinghe was a director of Perpetual Treasuries Ltd.
Mr. Palisena said he joined PTL in 2013 as the chief dealer and promoted as CEO on January 16, 2015, before the controversial bond issue.
He said PTL had in October 2012 applied to function as a primary dealer at the Central Bank and in October 2013, they received their license to function as such and had entered the market from February 2014.
In line with the license, every primary dealer adheres to submit a Business Plan to the CBSL, and the PTLs Business Plan contained its views as seeking longer tenure bonds, create liquidity in the secondary market and while promoting techniques used in the equity market (share market) to increase secondary market bond transactions.
Justice Prasanna Jayawardena asked the witness whether these techniques were obtained from the equity market. He said yes.
Justice Jayawardena asked, Do you know what happened in the share market in 2012. Witness said yes. Justice Jayawardena was of the view that there were allegations with regard to the techniques adopted by certain companies in the share market in 2012.
Targeting the Longer tenure bond deals, mostly those of seven years or more, the PTL had started its operations in February 2014 with a capital of Rs.310.3 million.
For the six months, from April 1, 2014 to September 30, 2014, the PTL had earned a profit of Rs.816 million through bond transactions in the secondary market.
At the time we entered the market other primary dealers had a higher capital than us, but they were not trading as aggressively as we did, they were passive investors, we wanted to become experts in the longer tenure bond transactions, Mr. Palisena said.
In six months PTL had gained a 400 % rise in their capital and Rs.576 profit earned from trading.
Justice Prasanna Jayawardena asked, Was the then Governor Ajith Nivard Cabraals sister Shiromi Wickremesinghe a director of your company in 2014 the witness said yes.
The witness said they were only dealing in secondary market transactions at the time that they earned a profit of Rs.816 million.
The witness was of the view that the yield rate in the market was increasing after July 2014 due to market factors but the rate had been suppressed by not having auctions in the market.
He said there was no hike in the foreign exchange rate either. The witness was of the view that the market rate was suppressed by such means and added that the interest rate was supposed to be increasing but it did not happen. Due to such suppression foreign investors started exiting the market, with an outflow of Rs.2 billion in foreign reserves reported during the latter part of 2014.
Mr. Palisena said even though in September 2014, there was an increase in the market yield rate by 60 basis points it was not enough to compensate the outflow of foreign reserves.
Foreigners exit, because the yield rate was very low in 2014 and the exchange also gave cheaper dollars he said.
The witness said they however expected an upward movement in the interest rate by the latter part of 2014 and thereby in October the PTL sold their long tenure bonds even at a loss. He said in the light of the election at that point the selling of bonds had intensified, because of uncertainty.
When Justice Jayawardena asked why the PTL wanted to sell if they were interested earlier in the longer tenure bonds, the witness said it was because of the big gap between the market rate and the actual rate.
However, by November, 2014, the PTL had sold all their bonds and was fully liquidated while only dealing in short term bond deals in the market.
Meanwhile, the witness said he could predict the Governments fund requirement for the next thirty to forty years using the analytical information available to him as a primary dealer.
He said that using the CBSL details on maturity repayment for the bonds in coming years he could prepare the possible requirement of the governments future fund requirement.
When the Commission questioned him, he said if some significant event occurred changing such requirement then they could adjust their predictions.
Presidents Counsel Nihal Fernando who led the evidence on behalf of the PTL was of the view that the PTL had the individual potential and sources with such capability which the other primary dealers did not have.
However, when Justice Jayawardena asked about the availability of the information on the Governments prospective cash figures on its revenue (income and expenditure) to the witness, Mr. Palisena said they were not available to anyone. He added that it was through a part of information and factors they used to predict the Government's fund requirement.
He explained that the PTL had engaged in Rs.276 billion worth of secondary market transactions and Rs.2.5 billion direct placement transactions from April, 2014 to February 2015.
Explaining to the Commission about the difference between price takers and makers, the witness said Traders, Captive sources, Pension fund, EPF, ETF, Insurance Corporation, etc., are interested in the longer tenure bonds.
Comparing the nature of the Bond Market and the stock market, the witness said the share market is a system-driven market unlike the bond market which is not system driven but the Over The Counter method where negotiations and bargains were necessary to strike a deal. (By Shehan Chamika Silva)

## Title: RESPONSE TO MINISTER MANGALA SAMARAWEERA BY PROF. G.L. PEIRIS
## Section: News Features

RESPONSE TO MINISTER MANGALA SAMARAWEERA BY PROF. G.L. PEIRIS
	
I refer to the response by Mangala Samaraweera, Minister of Finance and Media, to my comments on the consequences of the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearances Bill, currently before Parliament. 
It is important to penetrate the fog of evasion and misinformation, and to identify the issues with stark clarity. 
Is there any prospect of Foreign Judges tryingSri Lankan military personnel
The answer is, quite definitely, yes.
Operative paragraph 6 of Resolution 30/1 of the Human Rights Council, adopted on October 1, 2015, refers specifically to Commonwealth and other foreign judges. This is the Sri Lanka Governments unequivocal commitment to the international community. It is not an obligation imposed on us by any external agency. On the contrary, it is the Governments own pledge, embodied in a Resolution co-sponsored by it. 
To repudiate this solemn commitment by pronouncements, however strident, within the country is both insincere and futile. The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, several other senior officials of the United Nations system, Members of the Parliament of the United Kingdom, the Tamil National Alliance, spokespersons for the Tamil diaspora and others have insisted in recent months that the Government should deliver on its own pledges, or face the consequences. 
"Article 11(1) of the Convention gives a State Party in the territory under whose jurisdiction a person alleged to have committed an offence of enforced disappearance is found, the right to extradite that person or surrender him or her to another State in accordance with its international obligations. Apparently, this, too, is acceptable to the Government."

Does the new Bill take a further, and even more dangerous step
There is no doubt that it does. 
The proposed legislation explicitly envisages contexts in which members of the Sri Lankan military are subjected compulsorily to the jurisdiction of courts of foreign countries. We are, then, moving decisively from foreign judges coming to Sri Lanka to try our Armed Forces, to our military personnel being tried away from their own soil by the courts of other countries. 
No one can deny that this is the plain effect of Article 9 (2) of the International Convention. It provides as follows: Each State Party shall take such measures as may be necessary to establish its competence to exercise jurisdiction over the offence of enforced disappearance when the alleged offender is present in any territory under its jurisdiction. 
Thus, any member of the Sri Lankan military, found for any reason within the territory of a country which is a signatory to the Convention, will be tried by the courts of that country. This is not a mere discretionary entitlement of that country but an imperative duty imposed on it by the terms of the Convention. 
This cannot happen under the present law. The legal position, however, changes drastically with the enactment of the new law which is expressly intended to give effect to the International Convention. "The proposed legislation explicitly envisages contexts in which members of the Sri Lankan military are subjected compulsorily to the jurisdiction of courts of foreign countries. We are, then, moving decisively from foreign judges coming to Sri Lanka to try our Armed Forces, to our military personnel being tried away from their own soil by the courts of other countries"

Is there any danger of Sri Lankan military personnel being extradited to a foreign country
Quite categorically, yes. 
The explicit effect of section 8 of the proposed Bill is that, where a request is made by a foreign State, or on behalf of a foreign State, that a member of the Sri Lankan military or, for that matter, any citizen of our country be extradited to that State, the Government of Sri Lanka may be obliged to extradite that person if he is accused of the offence of enforced disappearance. 
This is certainly not part of the present law. It is an altogether new obligation which will be incurred by the Government of our country as a direct consequence of enactment of the legislation now before Parliament to make the International Convention operative within the legal system of Sri Lanka. 

Can a foreign country surrender Sri Lankan military personnel to a third foreign country for trial by the latter
Yes. Astonishing though this may seem, even this is provided for by the terms of the International Convention which the Government is proposing to adopt as part of our law. 
Article 11(1) of the Convention gives a State Party in the territory under whose jurisdiction a person alleged to have committed an offence of enforced disappearance is found, the right to extradite that person or surrender him or her to another State in accordance with its international obligations. Apparently, this, too, is acceptable to the Government. 

Is there merit in the claim that the new Bill has no effect on our extradition laws
No, this is not the position at all. 
Minister Samaraweera declares, in a sub-heading of his article, that The Bill has no implications on our Extradition Laws. This flies in the face of several clear provisions of the Bill which expressly purport to make significant changes in respect of the laws governing the extradition of persons from Sri Lanka. 
Where there is an extradition arrangement made by the Government of Sri Lanka with any Convention State, such arrangement is deemed for the purposes of the Extradition Law, No. 8 of 1977, to include provision for extradition in respect of offences under the new Bill (section 10). 
Even where there is no extradition arrangement in force, the new Bill purports to make provision in this regard. It declares, in section 11, that Where there is no extradition arrangement made by the Government of Sri Lanka with any Convention State, the Minister may by Order published in the Gazette, treat the Convention, for the purposes of the Extradition Law, No. 8 of 1977, as an extradition arrangement, made by the Government of Sri Lanka with the Convention State providing for extradition in respect of the offences under this Act. 
A basic safeguard embedded in the existing law is swept away by section 13 of the Bill. If the offence with regard to which extradition is sought, is an offence of a political character, extradition is not permissible in keeping with the current law. This salutary principle, involving a crucial measure of protection for cogent reasons of public policy, will no longer apply, once the proposed Bill is passed. 
Is the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court excluded
Minister Samaraweera contends that the International Criminal Court can in no circumstances exercise jurisdiction over a Sri Lankan national. 
I do not accept this proposition. There is real danger of Sri Lankan military personnel in the physical custody of a Convention State being surrendered to the International Criminal Court. 
The governing provisions of the Convention in this regard are Articles 9(2) and 11(1). 
The former provides that Each State Party shall take such measures as may be necessary to establish its competence to exercise jurisdiction over the offence of enforced disappearance when the alleged offender is present in any territory under its jurisdiction, unless it extradites or surrenders him or her to another State in accordance with its international obligations or surrenders him/her to an International Criminal Tribunal whose jurisdiction it has recognised. 
The effect of the latter provision is that The State Party in the territory under whose jurisdiction a person alleged to have committed an offence of enforced disappearance is found shall, if it does not extradite that person or surrender him or her to another State in accordance with its international obligations or surrender him or her to an International Criminal Tribunal whose jurisdiction it has recognised, submit the case to its competent authorities for the purposes of prosecution. 


"OISL documented long-standing patterns of arbitrary arrest and detention by Government security forces, which often reportedly led to enforced disappearances and extra-judicial killings. OISL documented brutal use of torture by the Sri Lankan security forces

The operative criterion in this regard is not the nationality of the person sought to be extradited, but the international obligations of the Convention State having custody of that person. If the International Criminal Tribunal is one whose jurisdiction it has recognised, then the duty to surrender to the Tribunal is capable of being invoked. Persons in the custody of the Convention State may belong to a variety of nationalities, but they would collectively fall within the scope of the duty devolving on the Convention State to surrender, if that State is bound by recognition of the International Criminal Tribunal in question as part of its own obligations. 
This danger is real and imminent. What is more, the obligation of surrender is not necessarily restricted to the ICC. The language used in the Convention is substantially wider. An International Criminal Tribunal whose jurisdiction it has recognised may apply, as well, to tribunals of a similar category, other than the ICC. 

Is there justification for the view that the Bill will not apply to the period of the war
Minister Samaraweera insists that Past violations cannot be prosecuted under the proposed law. This is entirely incorrect and misleading.
I have shown in my previous article that Resolution 30/1 of October 1, 2015, co-sponsored by the Government of Sri Lanka, is replete with compelling indications that the Government deliberately undertook the duty to take decisive action with regard to the past. 
While the Preamble to the Resolutions stressed the importance of a comprehensive approach to dealing with the past incorporating the full range of judicial and non-judicial measures, including individual prosecutions, and called stridently for mechanisms to redress past abuses and violations, Operative Paragraph 4 welcomed the commitment of the Government of Sri Lanka to undertake a comprehensive approach to dealing with the past. 
Among the specific obligations incurred by the Government of Sri Lanka is the setting up of an Office of Missing Persons to deal with past crimes. The proposed Bill is one of a series of measures which the Government is resorting to for the purpose of giving effect to these obligations. 
In any case, the duty cast on the Government of Sri Lanka comes into play at the point when a request is made to the Government of Sri Lanka for the extradition of any person accused of the offence of enforced disappearance (section 8). Although the offence may have been committed prior to enactment of the Bill, the making of a request by a foreign government  obviously subsequent to the passing of the Bill  triggers the provisions in the legislation, and deprives of substance the argument based on retro-activity. It is a mere red herring across the trail. 

Are Sri Lankan military personnel not extremely vulnerable
Minister Samaraweera declares: There may be some allegations against individual members of the military, but to date, no one has alleged that the military as an entity has committed these crimes. Nothing could be further from the truth. 
UNHRC Resolution 30/1 takes note with appreciation of the oral update presented by the United Nations High Commissioner to the Human Rights Council at its 27th session, the report of the Office of the High Commissioner and its investigation on Sri Lanka. 
The High Commissioner has been far from reticent about the gravity of the crimes allegedly committed by the Armed Forces of Sri Lanka, and the stark issue of criminal responsibility. He stated at a Press conference in Geneva: The severity of the crimes was most astonishing. 
The degree of bias and prejudgement is quite manifest. On the subject of genocide, the High Commissioner, while stating that this is something they do not perceive to have occurred in Sri Lanka at this stage, went on the declare: That is not, however, to say that at a subsequent stage, it is implausible. The Report specifically says that, if established before the hybrid court that was proposed, many of these allegations may amount, depending on the circumstances, to war crimes. 
The High Commissioner proclaimed, at a media briefing in Geneva, that the findings are of a most serious nature, involving as they do a pattern of systemic and flagrant violations. 
The extent of jeopardy to Sri Lankas Armed Forces is unmistakable. 
The Report sets out, in direct terms, the finding that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the gravest offences were committed by our nations military. 
The following assertions, quoted verbatim from the Report, are amply illustrative of the threshold of criminal liability envisaged and the resulting depth of peril. There are reasonable grounds to believe that the Sri Lankan security forces and paramilitary groups associated with them were implicated in unlawful killings carried out in a widespread manner against civilians. OISL documented long-standing patterns of arbitrary arrest and detention by Government security forces, which often reportedly led to enforced disappearances and extra-judicial killings. OISL documented brutal use of torture by the Sri Lankan security forces. The information gathered by OISL provides reasonable grounds to believe that rape and other forms of sexual violence by security forces personnel was widespread. 
These sweeping statements leave no room for doubt as to the intended consequences. Against the backdrop of these attitudes reflecting total lack of objectivity, the public are the best judges of the justice of leaving the fate of our countrys Armed Forces in the hands of foreign judicial tribunals. 

"Persons in the custody of the Convention State may belong to a variety of nationalities, but they would collectively fall within the scope of the duty devolving on the Convention State to surrender, if that State is bound by recognition of the International Criminal Tribunal in question as part of its own obligations"

Romeo  Juliet drama entertains Ministry staff
	

A Romeo- Juliet drama unfolding at a key Ministry is creating a welcome diversion for the staffers these days, they say.

Romeo, a brother in law of the purohita in charge of the Ministry is a member of the latters personal staff. Juliet is a young cute one attached to a another division of the Ministry.
Romeo is seen most of the time in the balcony of the third floor, his mobile phone held against the ear cooing sweet-nothings to his Juliet in another division located in a building in line with the ground floor of the high rise. The couple can see each other from these vantage positions, they say.
Watching the couple making love has become a source of entertainment to Ministry employees.
The superiors of the love-sick young man and the girl are unhappy that the couple is occupied with love making all the time doing hardly any work to earn their monthly pay, but are afraid to complain about their conduct to higher authorities for fear of incurring the displeasure of the purohita, they say.

Save Your Monkey announces official launch with Amaya
	
Saveyourmonkey.com, Sri Lankas pioneering Insurtech startup which began operations earlier this year, announced their official launch following the trilingual launch of Sri Lankas first digital insurance agent, Amaya.
The startup aims to change the traditional perception of procuring an insurance policy as being a tedious legal obligation via digitalization, and tested its platform and new ideas such as Amaya in the market following the soft launch in February this year. 
Amaya, the innovative brainchild of the Save Your Monkey team, was initially developed in English and is the first of its kind insurance chatbotin the South Asian Region. Amaya is a fun and easy way for customers to choose their insurance policy online and became immensely popular among users over the last few months while still at its testing stage.
Following this wide spread interest, the saveyourmonkey.com team jumped to action and worked to launch the Amaya in all three languages to make it relevant and accessible to all Sri Lankans.
Speaking on the official launch of saveyourmonkey.com and the latest development with Amaya, Chathura Jayatissa, Founder and CEO of saveyourmonkey.com said, Aswe launch officially, we have made it our mission to change the public perception that procuring an insurance is a tedious task. Amaya was designed using AI (Artificial Intelligence) components to respond to customer inquiries effectively and provide them with the best advice for their requirements. We named the chatbot Amaya in order to make our customers feel at ease and to make them feel like they arechatting to a friend. With the AI components at work, Amaya interacts with customers as an actual person and thus quickly became popular among our customers.
Amaya is a first of its kind not only in Sri Lanka but also in the region. While the rest of the world has experienced rapid technological advancements in the insurance industry, things have been slow to progressin this part of the world.

Some govt. politicos behind drug trafficking: NUTA
	
The National University Teachers Association (NUTA) said there was public perception that some government politicians were behind drug trafficking and requested President Maithripala Sirisena to implement the law against wrongdoers irrespective of their status.
NUTA General Secretary Channa Jayasumana, in his letter to the President, said he had been informed that students were addicted to drugs such as heroin, ganja and hashish.
He said it appeared that those, peddling such drugs, escaped the long arm of the law and that though drugs were discovered in large quantities in sugar containers bound for Lanka Sathosa no action had been taken to punish those responsible.
Dr. Jayasumana said people were under the impression that drug trafficking took place with the blessings of Cabinet Ministers.
This will negatively impact on the principles of good governance, he said in his letter. (KB)

Syrian forces recapture Islamic States last stronghold in Homs
	

DPA, 07th AUGUST, 2017- Government forces have retaken control of Islamic States last bastion in Syrias central province of Homs in the latest setback to the extremist militia, a monitoring group and military sources said on Sunday.
The recapture of the strategically important town of al-Sukhna in Homs late Saturday followed intense bombardment by regime and allied Russian warplanes, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported. Retaking al-Sukhna allows government forces to advance on the eastern province of Deir al-Zour, which is mostly controlled by Islamic State militants.
Syrian forces, backed by Russian air power, on Sunday intensely shelled militants on a road linking al-Sukhna to Deir al-Zour, the Observatory reported.
Governnment troops and allied paramilitaries were meanwhile conducting a mopping-up operation inside al-Sukhna, the Britain-based watchdog added.
Government forces entered the town of al-Sukhna following fierce clashes with Daesh gunmen, of whom hundreds were forced to flee towards Deir al-Zour, a pro-government military commander said earlier, using an Arabic acronym for Islamic State.

The mysterious  broom  at Temple of Tooth
	
August, the month during which the Kandy Esala Maha Perahera (Pageant) is held, is a period during which we should consider what nations the world over have done to protect and contribute to the Sri Dalada Malgiawa. The Sri Dalada Maligawa has been endowed with objects and precious material over the years. One of the main benefactors has been Myanmar.
Among the herd of tuskers at the moment are two elephants from Buruma, Raja and Myannmar Raja. These elephants have been trained to carry the Golden Casket (Karanduwa) during the Kandy Esala Pageant. These tuskers may be replaced in the future. President Maithripala Sirisena is to receive one more tusker from Myanmar within the next few days. The animal has already been shipped according to Maligawa sources. There are three tuskers among the herd of elephants at the Sri Dalada Maligawa. 
The idea to have another tusker is the suggestion of Diyawadana Nilame Pradeep Nilanga Dela. He had suggested to get a white Tusker from Mayannmar, especially for the deployment of carrying the Golden Casket. However, the then President of Myanmar wasnt on the same page with the islands Maligawa authorities regarding the presenting of a tusker to Sri Lanka. But later, the President of Myanmar had offered a tusker as a gift from the Government of Myanmar to the Government of Sri Lanka. 
The tusker was inspected by the veterinarians before being shipped. The authorities had encountered problems regarding high transport costs. President Sirisena had intervened and solved the problem by making arrangements for the Government of Sri Lanka to bear the transportation costs. Now the Tusker is reported to be on its way to Sri Lanka. However it wont be here on time for the pageant. 

Gifts from Burma
The Burmese are devoted to the Sri Dalada Maligawa. The stone pillars on which rest the upper floors above the Hewisi Mandapaya or Drummer Hall are gifts from Burmese devotees. On the stone pillars are inscribed the names of our friends from Yangon (Earlier Rangoon). The casket is also a gift from a Burmese King and a number of such gifts has been offered to the Sri Dalada Maligawa. 
When Upasampada (Ordination) rites were no longer in Sri Lanka, it was the Burmese Sangha (Buddhist monastic order) who brought the rites before the Siam Nikaya. Ven. Sooriyagoda Nayaka Thera was one such monk who was ordained with Burmese Upasamapda rites. The Upasampada ritual faded away and its in this impasse that Venerable Weliwita Sangharaja Thera requested King Keerthi Sri Rajasingha to allow the Thai Upasampada rituals to be brought to Sri Lanka. 
A TUSKER FROM BURMA

The begging bowl
Yet there is a school of thought that supports the ideology that the begging bowl of Buddha has always been where the Sacred Tooth Relic is preserved. There are others who support another school of thought and believe that the begging bowl is preserved within Natha Devale. Late Professor Ven. Warakawe Dhammaloka Thera was of the view that Lord Buddhas begging bowl was placed in a stupa (A structure containing relics) close to the Sri Dalada Maligawa. However, some time ago, the Indian Museum displayed some pieces which they claimed were the remains of the Buddhas begging bowl. This is now a matter of debate and no authority has confirmed the place where this object used by Lord Buddha is preserved.
However, it is recorded that during the year 1576, the King of Burma received a delegation from Sri Lanka. They were from the Kingdom of Kotte. According to these records this begging bowl is fashioned out of stone. Whether these records are genuine is a matter of opinion. But many believe that the begging bowl is preserved somewhere in the vicinity of the Sri Dalada Maligawa. 
There is an object within the inner shrine room of the Sri Dalada Maligawa. Its said that this object hasnt been used for the purpose it was meant for. This object is known as the Human Hair Broom. Its a broom with a short handle and is kept covered with white cloth. Its used very rarely. This broom was shown to this writer by the then Mahanayake of the Asgiriya Chapter Ven. Palipanne Chandananda Thera. This was during the time when the monk did his duties in the inner shrine room.This broom with a short handle was presented by King Bayinnaung of Burma who ascended to the throne during 1662. This was also the time when King Dharmapala ascended to the throne in Kotte. The Broom was offered at a time when the Sacred Relic was in Kotte.


"There is no tradition of offering human hair to temples in Sri Lanka. This is a practice of the Burmese. They offer anything that they can afford to the Temple of the Tooth"
HAIR BROOMS
It had been the practice then to offer human hair to temples in Burma for the purpose of sweeping the temple floors. This practice was done as penance. The human hair in such brooms is said to be the hair of the King and Queen Queen themselves. 
A question that might surface in anyones mind is whether the hair used in the broom, presented to the heirs of the Kotte Kingdom, would remain for so long There is no tradition of offering human hair to temples in Sri Lanka. This is a practice of the Burmese. They offer anything that they can afford to the Temple of the Tooth. 
Yet how the sacred tooth relic and the begging bowl were later accepted by the Kandyan authorities as inheritance isnt known. According to the Mahawamsa its a fact that both these sacred possessions were exhibited between the 12th and 14th Century. 

King Bayinnaung
According to historic records King of Burma Bayinnaung was considered to be the greatest benefactor and protector of Buddhism. In fact orthodox monk Shin Arahan was instrumental in the reemergence of Buddhism in Burma. This was a time when Hinduism was set to take over Buddhism. 
In fact King Bayinnnaung is said to have conquered parts of China. The Portuguese, who were spreading their tentacles to build an Empire throughout Asia, feared King Bayinnaung. His forethought was to protect Buddhism and not just Burma. 
When the news reached the King that King Dharmapala ascended to the Thorne of Kotte, he lost no time in sending a delegation to inquire into the position of the Sacred Tooth Relic. Its during the year 1576 that this king sent a second delegation to Sri Lanka. Its said that this delegation brought, among other gifts, the broom made of human hair.
Unlike the begging bowl, the broom made of human hair has lasted until today. But its not used, nor is it exhibited to the public. Even before the Mahanayake of Asgiriya showed the broom to me, its with pride that I reminisce that this Burmese gift was shown to my brother and me on several occasions by an uncle of mine, a monk at the Asgiriya Temple. 
I consider it a matter of great importance to share my personal experiences to enlighten the public- who pay obeisance at the Sri Dalada Maligawa- that such objects exist. Objects like these signify the unity and the great camaraderie that had existed between these two Buddhist nations. Its also heartening to note that a man born to Royalty had gifted something very personal to Buddhism in Sri Lanka. 
But, unfortunately, the Burmese distanced themselves after their King wasnt given an opportunity to pay homage to the Sacred Tooth Relic- when he visited Sri Lanka.

## Title: The today and tomorrow of Sinhala

The today and tomorrow of Sinhala
	
The Cumaratunga Munidasa Sisuvarama, organised by the Cumaratunga Munidasa Foundation, was held for the sixth consecutive time on July 25 (Tuesday) at the Lakshman Kadirgamar Centre in Colombo.
Poetry strikes us in roughly the same way that the movies strike the Americans. In both instances, we are so overwhelmed by the first time we heard or saw them; which American cant think of their archetypal saviour, the cowboy, without remembering the films of John Ford (The Searchers), and which Sri Lankan cant think of the rabbit, probably the most cartoonish animal out there, without thinking of Cumaratunga Munidasas Ha Ha Hari Hawa and the many renditions of it 
The great achievement of a movie, I think, is the great achievement of a poem; both take us back to those triumphs, defeats, broken hearts, and so much more besides that we had undergone when we first encountered them. A film is like a language, after all; its built, sustained, sometimes even improved on through nostalgia. But nostalgia alone isnt enough. What is needed, now more than ever before, is a set of discerning people to transform that nostalgia into a living, breathing entity. The Sinhala language is a case in point. It nourishes us, and then appeals to us to perpetuate it. 
I know, have talked with, and have conceded to those doomsday prophets (whose numbers are increasing, disturbingly) who predict the end of the Sinhala language as we know it. Underlying their prediction are certain irrefutable facts, prime among them being the virtual erasure of its spoken/written dichotomy by popular culture. 
Its one of the greatest ironies of our time, but when mass media (journalism, advertising, television) discovered our mother tongue, it wasnt liberated. It was stunted. Rather badly. Probably thats why its hard to come across young poets writing in Sinhala, not because they dont have the ideas but because they dont read. Its a contemporary dilemma, since by refusing to read, they refuse to take forward what underpins all those poems which nourishedtheir childhoods. 
For that reason, a scholarship program aimed at recognising academic achievement in Sinhala has to take note of certain realities. Firstly, not every student who achieves distinctions in that subject actually continues to study it. More often than not, these students are compelled to take to another subject once they reach their A Levels (with science and commerce being the preferred options). Secondly, the scholarship as such, while monetary at the outset, must aim for more than the usual incentives such schemes are built on, not least because a language cant be limited to academia and is probably the only subject that lives and breathes on its own outside academia. 
In 2012 the Cumaratunga Munidasa Foundation began one such program. That year was special; it marked the 125th birth anniversary of the Foundations figurehead. Together with the National Savings Bank and Ada Derana, each winner was given a monthly bursary of 1,000 rupees, a 100,000 rupee bank deposit, and a laptop. Named Sisuvarama, the program was unique for one reason. It targeted the Ordinary Level exams, knowing that not all high achievers at that stage in their education follow it up as the years pass by. The organisers of Sisuvarama were spot on there, since almost all the scholarship winners have subsequently moved into other harder subjects. 
That was five years back. Five years later, more specifically two weeks ago (July 25) at the Lakshman Kadirgamar Centre in Colombo, the Foundation held its scholarship ceremony for the sixth time, in commemoration of Cumaratunga Munidasas 130th birth anniversary. It was an ill-chosen day: the petrol strike was on. Such a mundane issue, however, couldnt overwhelm what I took from this Sisuvarama. 


"The problem with the contemporary world is that it separates the academic from the social. We are goaded into categorising the likes of Cumaratunga as writers, poets, forgetting that they were less the intellectuals they are cut out to be"

The stories behind this years winners merit mention here. Of the seven, three come from Galle, two from Panadura, one from Minuwangoda, and one from Colombo. The three winners from Galle (Sandamini Paranavithana, Thiwanka Ruvishani, and Yasamini Anuththara) all attended Sanghamitta Balika, and all three come from backgrounds which, while certainly not cosmetic or extravagant, nurtured their love to read and to write. Roshani Dhanushika (from Presidents College, Minuwangoda) took an interest in the subject after she began to be taught by capable teachers from Grade Eight. Pasindu Buwaneka de Silva (from Isipathana College), had to write his paper while recovering from dengue at the Infectious Diseases Hospital in Angoda. Vimukthi Abhishek (from Nalanda College) started entering essay competitions from Grade Three, while Thisari Walawage entered her present school (Visakha Vidyalaya) from the Grade Five scholarship and studied in the Englishmedium thereafter. 


Of the people who spoke that day, Professor Wimal Dissanayake struck me the most. In the space of half an hour, Professor Dissanayake dwelt on an otherwise hackneyed topic: the place for modernity in tradition. Mercifully, he wasnt concerned about bringing modernity to tradition, rather the other way around and that by delving into how the man at the centre of the event ensured that we did not forget who we were while engaging with the rest of the world. Aluth aluth da nothanana jaathin lova nonagi, Victor Ratnayake quoted Cumaratunga Munidasa for me as he lamented how todays composers have forgotten the past. Whats true for our composers is true for those who will wield our mother
tongue tomorrow. 
The problem with the contemporary world is that it separates the academic from the social. We are goaded into categorising the likes of Cumaratunga as writers, poets, or the more derogatory deshiya buddhimathun, forgetting that they were less the intellectuals they are cut out to be than the national revivalists they actually were. Reading Kumara Gee, I cannot help but conclude that Cumaratunga Munidasa, much as he loved the language of the Sinhalese, loved it less than he loved his nation and his people, Malinda Seneviratne wrote, and I agree. To me, and to my countrymen, his legacy cant be rationalised by linguistics or semantics or sociology. He was more, much more, than anything those terms can ever convey. 


When Nanda Malini resurrected not just Cumaratunga but also Tibet S. Mahinda and Wimalaratne Gamage in her collection Handahami, she gave out some of the most memorable lyrics we had heard as children. I could feel a thin film of tears across my eyes as she sang Ha Ha Hari Hawa, that romantic tribute to the rabbit which Titus Thotawatte took as the title song of his version of Bugs Bunny. The film opened up when I realised that Titus had been an ardent follower of Cumaratunga; as a member of the Hela Havula, he was the first in our cinema who tried to do away with those Sanskrit impurities his guru had strived to erase. It opened up even more when I remembered that my childhood had been adorned by a popular culture (including Dosthara Honda Hitha) which stood for what my country spoke, in one voice. That voice went back to one person, one name. The connection was hard not to make. 
That is why Sisuvarama is so important to me, to my country, to everyone interested in Sinhala. A language, by its definition, sweeps across demographics and social barriers. It survives despite them because its a living, breathing entity. But I am upset by how we tend to our own language less and less, particularly those of us who are entranced by modernity and the modernist discourse on nationality. 


The fact is that we dont read our own books, our own stories. The fact is that we market our aptitude for our language without nourishing ourselves in our literature. By forgetting grammar and syntax, artists dabbling in Sinhala today are doing a disservice to our language. They are little more than anchorless ships, a point which crops up when considering that they are hailed by some as revolutionaries. Well, so were James Joyce and Jean-Luc Godard, but unlike their counterparts today, they were aware of the work done before them, which prepared them for what they did. 
All this is rooted in a rotten circle that goes around and around; those who grow up in Sinhala-speaking families lose their interest in it, enchanted as they are by pop culture, while those who grow up in a more westernised environment abandon it to devote themselves to English theatre and literary circles. (This strange dichotomy, between those who neglect Sinhala despite their vernacular backgrounds and those who take to English because of their non-vernacular backgrounds, baffles me.) But by that I dont bemoan modernity, as some do. The truth is that modernity and nationalism can and do cohere, and as scholars like Benedict Anderson have observed, the latter can be more unifying than the cosmopolitanism we teach our children today. 
The Cumaratunga Munidasa Foundation has clearly taught us some lessons in that respect. Relevant for our time, relevant for all time. What they are, we know. All we need to do is take a leaf from them, and from those seven students who won this year, and try to define ourselves based on how much we understand what defines us. It wont be easy, but my guess is that it wont be too difficult either.

Trump asks  tough questions  on Afghan mission: Tillerson
	

President Donald Trump has asked his advisers tough questions about American strategy in Afghanistan and is not willing to continue on as before, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said Monday. 
The White House has launched a review of the US plan for Afghanistan after 16 years of war; reports suggest Trumps national security team is divided on whether to send more troops or to pull out. 
Speaking in Manila on the sidelines of a regional security forum, Tillerson said Trump would not be content with continuing the fight as before. 
The president is not willing to accept that, so he is asking some tough questions, Tillerson told reporters. 
Tillerson said the presidents National Security Council has met three times on the issue and that Vice President Mike Pence has joined Trump in taking a close interest in the strategy review. 
Trumps generals have called the Afghan conflict a stalemate and even after years of intensive help from the US and other NATO nations, Afghanistans security forces are still struggling to hold back an emboldened Taliban. In an early move to address the situation, Trump gave his Pentagon chief, former general Jim Mattis, broad powers to set troop numbers. But several months later the level remains stuck at about 8,400 US and about 5,000 NATO troops. 
Mattis wants to wait until the White House has come up with a coherent strategy for not just Afghanistan but the broader region, notably Pakistan and how it deals with terror groups, before he commits to adjustments.
