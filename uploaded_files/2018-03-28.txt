A Young Woman?s Guide to a Career in IT
	
Sri Lanka continues to rise as a preferred Information Technology (IT) / Business Process Management (BPM) destination.Leading names in IT and IT-enabled services either have a presence in our paradise isle already or are keen on setting up operations here.Strong government support, the market?s cost competitiveness and our highly skilled tech talent too has played a significant role in the sector growth story.However, the question arises if we have sufficient supply to meet the increasing demands of the IT/BPM industry.
In Sri Lanka the ICT workforce still constitutes of men, largely. It gets even more dismal when we look at the higher echelons of the sector, unfortunately.Holding the sector back,this has an adverse effect on our economy as a whole too.
In this light, the Asian Development Bank, together with the Export Development Bank of Sri Lanka as the nodal agency,is stressing on the need for concerted action to engage and empower women in Sri Lanka to pursue careers.
This led to the creation of Diversity Collective LK, a forum committed to making Sri Lanka a key global hub of human resources offering optimal gender diversity in the local IT and services industries.
The forum which operates under the auspices of the Sri Lanka Association of Software Solution Companies (SLASSCOM) seeks to achieve this by building community wide awareness regarding careers for women in the IT and BPO sectors.The forum also empowers women and girls in Sri Lanka to choose careers in the IT and BPO sectors and enables them to remain and advance in those careers. It focuses its efforts on 3 principal areaswhich areschools, universities / higher education institutions and the industry.
As a founding member and the current President of Diversity Collective LK, I have had the opportunity to interact with countless young women in universities around the island. Pursuing their higher education in ICT,they are set to change the gender imbalance in the IT sector.
Focusingdoggedly on their academics, these future leaders are sure to ace their exams and get called in for job interviews by the top IT firms in the country.
But, as we all know, it takes a bit more than sound technical knowledge to get the job and rise through the ranks in IT. Simple things that anyone could get right with a bit of guidance and effort.
I was part of a team of women leaders from the IT sector who shared these nuggets with a group of female undergraduate tech students at a workshop recently. Some of the tips we shared with them were:
Get the basics right
One cannot stress enough on the importance of getting the basics right. Your CV needs to be brief. And try to be creative with it. Offer a snapshot of your life beyond the campus too. Your referees, who cannot be friends and family, need to know the professional side of you and must be kept informed. Review all documents as a slight oversight in any of these aspects can result in your application being rejected even before an initial interview.
At the interview, exude confidence and maintain eye contact with the interviewer all throughout. Do ask a few questions about the company, the job, etc.
Go beyond the academics
The fact that you have been called in for a job interview shows that the employer has read your CV and is aware of your academic performance. So just mention a few key highlights and avoid going over it in detail. Instead, showcase how there is more to you than just academics. Touch on your interests and hobbies, extracurricular activities you took part in, other skills, etc. Show them how you have been adept at managing all this simultaneously during your student days.
Connect the dots
Sri Lanka?s IT / BPMlandscape is made up of a mix of companies who do different types of work using different sets of technologies. So, while job descriptions might sound similar, what you will be doing in that role is likely to be very different. Hence do some research about the company,the work it does, the job you are applying for and the interviewer too, if possible.See if you have any relevant experience from your university days and bring it up during the interview. Help the interviewer see how your skillset is aligned with the demands of the job and the type of the work the company does.?
Staying Current
The rate of transformational change taking place in the world of IT outpaces almost all other industries. Hence both new entrants and seasoned leaders need to continue to learn and stay abreast with these changes. While we might not be able to become experts in all emerging technologies, we need to have a fair understanding of the underlying concepts and principles and appreciate their implications to our work. As students, this knowledge will help shape your opinion about the direction the industry is heading in. And an informed opinion on industry trends is something any recruiter will be impressed by.
While we work with all stakeholders on empowering more women to enter the IT field, I believe that simple pointers such as thesewill play a small yet significant role in helping young female tech undergraduates crack their interviews and join us in taking Sri Lanka?s IT sector to greater heights.

Britain hails ?turning point? after Russian spy expulsions
	
?
Britain Tuesday hailed the mass expulsion of suspected Russian spies around the world as a ?turning point? for the West?s attitude to a ?reckless? Russia, as Moscow prepared?
its response.? ?
At least 116 alleged agents working under diplomatic cover were ordered out by 22 governments on Monday, dwarfing similar measures in even the most notorious Cold War spying disputes.? ?
??Never before have so many countries come together to expel Russian diplomats,? British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson wrote in The Times daily, calling it ?a ?blow from which Russian intelligence will need many years to recover?.? ?The expulsions were a response to the poisoning of Russian double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia with a nerve agent in the English city of Salisbury on March 4.? ?
?Russia has warned it is preparing a tit-for-tat response to those countries ?pandering to British authorities? without, Moscow claims, fully understanding what had happened.? ?

Cabinet committee on economic management scrapped
	
President Maithripala Sirisena is reported to have obtained Cabinet approval to scrap the Cabinet Committee on Economic Management (CCEM) headed by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.
The President submitted a Cabinet paper seeking to abolish this committee.
The CCEM was appointed under the new government to take decisions on economic affairs.
However, the President proposed that only the Cabinet should decide on these matters to appoint Cabinet subcommittees to discuss special cases in relation to the economy rather than having a body like the CCEM.
Earlier, the President was critical of decisions taken by the CCEM. (Kelum Bandara)

Coveted post now goes a-begging
	
?
The senior colleagues of the Green party had invited the long standing party deputy who has made the deep South his political base to take over the party leadership, but the latter had declined saying that the time was not opportune for him to take over the job, they say.?
?
Citing the provincial polls round the corner, the young deputy had explained that if the party lost the upcoming provincial polls soon after his taking over the party leadership, it would not augur well for his political future as well as that of the party.
Meanwhile, another party senior who made his debut into politics by promising a new Sun for the Colombo city in a catchy rhyming Sinhala slogan, had declined the leadership for the 14th time, they say.
So all moves made by the Green rebels to replace the current party leader with a more acceptable younger one have ended at square one, they say.

Diplomatic negotiations underway to return Udayanga
	
Diplomatic negotiations are currently underway to return the former Sri Lankan Envoy to Russia and Ukraine Udayanga Weeratunga, Police Media Spokesman said today.
Former diplomat Weeratunga was arrested by Dubai Authorities following an investigation carried out by the Financial Crimes Investigation Division (FCID).
Mr. Weeratunga was previously detained at the Dubai Airport on February 04 and a group of local law enforcement authorities who went to bring him down had to return empty handed as there was only a blue warrant issued by the Interpol at that time on him.
Police Media Division announced on February 23 that the INTERPOL had issued a ?Red Warrant' on Mr. Weeratunga, naming him as a fugitive wanted by the Sri Lankan authorities. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

Don't fall prey to fraudsters: Vehicle importers
	
Vehicle Importers Association Lanka (VIAL) today said that there was a racket of cheating customers, claiming that they could import provide vehicles less than the market prices from their showrooms.
Addressing the media VIAL President Indika Sampath Merenchige said fraudsters collect cash advances for vehicles from public and when they unable to deliver for those low-prices carry out sinister campaigns against various trading associations.
Therefore, the Association had decided to introduce a display board at every showroom of members of VIAL, indicating their symbol and the membership number, where customers could clearly identify authentic car sale showrooms endorsed by its organization.
The VIAL had decided to resort to this measure taking into consideration the complaints it received with regard to frauds the general public faced at the point of vehicle sales, Mr Merenchige said.
?This will enable customers to buy their vehicle without falling prey to fraudsters who masquerade as car sale agents. Only permanent members of VIAL with a proven track record will be given permission to carry the billboard in front of their showrooms,? Mr Merenchige said.
The customers could also determine the authenticity of vehicle showrooms who had not been enlisted yet for the billboard to find out for sure whether they were VIAL members by checking their credentials, he said.
?Many fraudulent vehicle sellers claim that the Wagon R vehicles which cost Rs. 3.4 million could be bought for Rs 3 million through reputed car import organization. Those sellers used to rob people by placing advertisements on websites and in newspapers saying that they can provide vehicles for less than the market price. Many people have lost millions of their money by falling prey to such fraudsters,? he said.
As the first phase of the project, VIAL had issued display boards for the first 25 members who applied for it and on the demand, the other members too will be issued the display board.
The VIAL plans to intervene in the big way to prevent such frauds at the time of vehicle sales. The VIAL has also decided to intervene in an improbable event of any of its members indulging in any deceitful practice and would not hesitate to remove such a member form its association, Mr Merenchige added.

Evidence unfolding before courts on Lasantha's Murder
	
The DIG had instructed?Sugathapala to remove the?pages of the GCIB where he?had entered the notes?
	When Sugathapala showed?his disapproval, DIG?Nanayakkara had warned?Sugathapala and revealed?that he was following?a directive
	DIG Nanayakkara told?him that the IGP had?wanted to destroy the?evidence leading to?Wickrematunge?s murder
	Nanayakkara had further?asked Sugathapala?whether he would like to?be killed if the IGP?s orders?are not implemented
	According to Adikari, he?and Sugathapala had?become helpless and?the pages of the GCIB?had been removed
	Meanwhile the?first suspect in?Wickrematunge murder?case, military intelligence?officer Premananada?Udalagama, who is?on bail for abducting
	Wickrematunge?s driverone?of the witnesses in?the murder case- had?been later posted to the?Sri Lankan Embassy in?Germany by the then?Defence Ministry officials
	Udalagama was given a?separate apartment in?Germany and all his food?and lodging was paid for?by the Government of?Sri Lanka
	The ?B? report further?reveals how two Tamil?youths had been stopped?in Vavuniya by those who?came in a jeep and taken?away. Their blue coloured
	motorcycle had been?taken away by some of?them who were involved?in the abduction
	The CID had received?information regarding??two unidentified charred?bodies found from?Gambirisgaswewa, north of?Anuradhapura on January
	19, 2009- the day after the?abduction had taken place
?
The unfolding evidence the Criminal Investigation Department is now gathering reveals how the former Head of Sri Lanka Police is alleged to have had in his possession the most vital evidence which was destroyed to thwart the investigations conducted into the brutal murder of former Editor of The Sunday Leader Lasantha Wickrematunge.? ?
Despite destroying the vital evidence to botch the investigations allegedly carried out on the directives of the then Inspector General of Police (IGP), the timely action reportedly taken secretly by the former Crime OIC Mt. Lavinia SI, Tissasiri Sugathapala to photocopy and preserve the evidence has helped the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) to obtain concrete proof into who was behind The Sunday Leader Editor?s assassination.? ?
Meanwhile the CID told the court that there was no necessity for the former Judicial Medical Officer (JMO) of the Colombo South Teaching Hospital Kalubowila, Dr. K. Sunil Kumara to issue a misleading autopsy report claiming that the cause of death was due to cranio cerebral injuries following a discharge of a firearm unless pressure was mounted on him to release the report to hoodwink the investigators.? ?
Upon receiving the information from Balraj?s wife, a CID team in 2016 had made inquiries from all police stations in and around Vavuniya to obtain details of the missing Tamil youths
Although Dr. Kumara?s postmortem report says as such, Prof. Mohan Silva, who performed the emergency operation on Lasantha Wickrematunge soon after he was brought to the hospital, says in the report that there was no trace of gunshot injuries.
So was the Government Analyst?s finding as well. Colombo Chief JMO Dr. Ajith Tennakoon, who headed a three member JMO team, too confirmed in his autopsy report of 2017 that the death was caused as a result of multiple stab injuries to the deceased?s skull.? ?
?
?
?B? REPORT? ?
Meanwhile the ?B? report submitted to court by the CID states how the details of the telephone conversation which features former Kalubowila JMO shows that he was in touch with the third suspect, DIG Prasanna Nanayakkara, to conceal evidence of the Wickrematunge murder. According to the details of the call, the DIG had been constantly in touch with Dr. K. Kumara from the time Wickrematunge was pronounced death and also after the CID began the investigation, following the fall of the Rajapaksa regime.? ?
The Supreme Court in February issued an interim Order preventing the arrest of former IGP Jayantha Wickramaratne, who was the Head of Sri Lanka Police at the time the murder took place, until a final determination is made in connection with the Fundamental Rights petition filed by Wickramaratne to prevent his imminent arrest.? ?
Lasantha Manilal Wickrematunge was murdered on January 8, 2009 in Attidiya in the high security zone in close proximity to the Ratmalana Airforce Base. According to the respective ?B? Report submitted to court by the CID, from the time the attack took place, the Sri Lanka Police had allegedly adopted methods to conceal evidence. However, former OIC Crime Mt. Lavinia had taken photocopies of Wickrematunge?s notebook and other vital documents before handing over the originals to the DIG Western Province (South) which had helped the CID to conduct further investigations.
According to the statements made by the former SSP Mt. Lavinia Adikari Appuhamilage Hemantha Harischandra Appuhamy alias Hemantha Adikari and the then OIC Crimes SI, Tissasiri Sugathapala (second suspect), it was on the directives of the then IGP Jayantha Wickramaratne through DIG Mirihana, Vitharana Arachchige Sirimevan Prasanna Nanayakkara (third suspect), that evidence had been concealed or destroyed to botch the investigation.? ?
Sugathapala had further stated how he got Vishwakala Printers at Pirivena Road, Mt. Lavinia to bind the GCIB in question, inserting new pages in place of the removed ones
Wickrematunge, was a vocal critic of abuse of power and corruption of the former regime and was subjected to intimidation on several occasions before he was killed in 2009 in broad daylight. The Sunday Leader newspaper was once sealed and it was also subject to continuous bomb attacks during which the attackers targeted their Ratmalana press. These attacks were carried out to stop Wickrematunge from exposing nepotism, corruption and abuse of power in the country. It was not a secret that The Sunday Leader under Wickrematunge posed the biggest threat for the Rajapaksa regime. Wickrematunge did not leave any stone unturned to expose corruption and fraud that took place in the Rajapaksa administration one after another with substantial proofs.? ?
Not even three weeks after slaying Wickrematunge, the then Defence Spokesman Keheliya Rambukwella at a media briefing, held on January 28, 2009, said that the Government was aware of the identities of Wickrematunge?s killers and President Mahinda Rajapaksa was anticipating to uncover ?some very important details? by February 15, 2009. However, these ?very important details? never came to light although Wickrematunge?s widow Sonali Samarasinghe Wickrematunge repeatedly made written requests to Rajapaksa and the then IGP to get an impartial investigation carried out to arrest the murderers and those who had given orders to assassinate her husband.? ?
?
AN ORDER FROM THE TOP? ?
Be that as it may, in his statement to the CID, Hemantha Adikari states as to how he instructed Crime OIC Mt. Lavinia, SI Sugathapala to conduct investigations on to the two motorcycle registration numbers which Wickrematunge had penned down on his notebook moments before he was killed. The Crime OIC had been quick enough to obtain the details of the owners of the two motor bicycles from the Department of Registration of Motor Vehicles (RMV).? ?
Adikari further states how DIG Nanayakkara reacted when the latter was informed of the new findings- details pertaining to the two registration numbers. Nanyakkara had instructed Adikari to come to his Mirihana office immediately with the Crime OIC together with Wickrematunge?s notebook and the police Grave Crime Information Book (GCIB) where the entries had been made by SI Sugathapala regarding the two registration numbers and the information regarding the owners of the said two motorcycles.? ?
The former SSP has further revealed how the DIG wanted SI Sugathapala to read out the note he (Sugathapala) had made in the GCIB and what Wickrematunge had written on the cover page of his note book. The DIG had then instructed Sugathapala to remove the pages of the GCIB where he had entered the notes, to which the latter had shown his disapproval. It was at that point that DIG Nanayakkara had warned Sugathapala and revealed that he was following a directive given by IGP Jayantha Wickramaratne. Nanayakkara had further asked Sugathapala whether he would like to be killed if the IGP?s orders are not implemented.? ?
According to what the CID informed court, when Udalagama was under arrest, the former Chief of National Intelligence at the Ministry of Defence, Kapila Hendawithana, had once made a request to the then Foreign Ministry to purchase three tickets for Udalagama?s wife and two children to visit Germany
According to Adikari, he and Sugathapala had become helpless and the pages of the GCIB had been removed and handed over to Nanayakkara together with the victims notebook knowing well that the order had come from the top.? ?
Adikari has further stated how DIG Nanayakkara told him that the IGP had wanted to destroy the evidence leading to Wickrematunge?s murder and Sugathapala was asked not to conduct any investigation into the two motorcycle registration numbers Wickrematunge had noted down.? ?
Furthermore, Adikari in his statement to the CID had stated that although Nanayakkara had informed him of the information received by the IGP on January 26, on the motorcycle believed to be used by Wickrematunge?s assailants, it was later revealed that the police team headed by Sugathapala had looked out for professional drivers on the day before the IGP is said to have received the information.? ?
Upon the recovery of the motorcycle on January 27, 2009 the Mt. Lavinia Police had been able to trace its owner, Paravasivam Thiyagarajah from Vavuniya. A police team led by IP Lalith Weerasinghe has been dispatched to bring Thiyagarajah for questioning.?
?
?Weerasinghe informed me that although the legal owner is Thiyagarajah, it had been sold to Balraj Ram Prakash in 2008. When this was reported to the DIG, instructions were given to arrest Thiyagarajah, obtain a detention order and bring him to Colombo for questioning. Although the DIG instructed to stop conducting further investigation into the registration numbers Wickrematunge had noted down, trying to question a Tamil over a motorcycle found in Attidiya canal was an attempt to implicate that the LTTE was behind the murder,? Adikari states in his proclamation .? ?
Meanwhile, former Crime OIC Mt. Lavinia SI, Tissasiri Sugathapala in his statement to the CID states that he had to remove four pages from the GCIB and handed them over to the DIG together with Wickrematunge?s notebook on January 16, 2009. He had further stated as to how he got the pages of the GCIB and Wickrematunge?s notebook photocopied and kept them safely for future reference before handing over the originals to DIG Nanayakkara.? ?
Sugathapala had further stated how he got Vishwakala Printers at Pirivena Road, Mt. Lavinia to bind the GCIB in question, inserting new pages in place of the removed ones. Giving a statement, Senaka Ralalage Premasiri Samarawardane (PC 50345) had told the CID how two officers from the Presidential Security Division (PSD) had visited Attidiya in civil when the search operation was in progress to recover the motorcycle. He had further stated how he had accompanied Sugathapala to Nalaka Book Industries at Borupana Road, Ratmalana to find a notebook similar to that of Wickrematunge?s. In the statement, he has stated how he overheard Sugathapala saying over the phone that the two motorcycles used in the ambush had been the properties of the Sri Lanka Army.? ?
PAGES REMOVED?
The CID has also obtained statements from Athugal Pendige Priyantha Kumara (PC 63764), Henaka Ralalage Premasiri Samarawardhana (PC 50345), Dilanimangalika Gunawardena (WPC 2949), IP Lalith Weerasinghe, Welikalage Chandana Pushpa Kumara (Civil Defence Force) Bandula Seneviratne (PC 70423), SI Jayantha Adikaram, Kapila Janaka Kumara Rajapaksa (Sergeant 13578), Susantha Kumari Welagedara (WPC 2941) and Aruna Janaka Kumara de Alwis (PC 63794) who were attached to the Crimes Division Mt. Lavinia Police at the time of the murder. They have confirmed how few pages of the questionable GCIB had been removed and handed over them to DIG Nanayakkara together with Wickremathunge?s note book. They have also stated that although the victim?s notebook was handed over to the Crime OIC on January 16, it had not been returned to date.? ?
According to the ?B? Reports, the motorcycle had been stolen in Vavuniya on January 18 by blindfolding and abducting Balraj Ram Prakash and Kumarasingham Vishnukumar whist they were travelling to Settikulam.? ?
The ?B? report further reveals how these two Tamil youths had been stopped in Vavuniya by those who came in a jeep and taken away. Their blue coloured motorcycle had been taken away by some of them who were involved in the abduction.? ?
Upon receiving the information from Balraj?s wife, a CID team in 2016 had made inquiries from all police stations in and around Vavuniya to obtain details of the missing Tamil youths. The CID had received information regarding two unidentified charred bodies found from Gambirisgaswewa, north of Anuradhapura on January 19, 2009- the day after the abduction had taken place.? ?
At the investigation, it had come to light that Dr. Ajith Jayasekera JMO Anuradhapura, who performed the postmortem on the two charred bodies, had found out that the two had died due to gunshot injuries caused to the back of their heads whilst their hands were tied.? ?
On October 10, 2016, the CID got the relatives of these two Tamil youths to identify the dead using the pictures of the charred bodies. The family members had identified the two deceased as their relatives. The ?B? report reveals that it is now confirmed that there was a military involvement in the murder and they wanted to connect the matter with the LTTE after killing the two Tamils and bringing the motorcycle they were riding on to Attidiya.? ?
Meanwhile the first suspect in Wickrematunge murder case, military intelligence officer Premananada Udalagama, who is on bail for abducting Wickrematunge?s driver- one of the witnesses in the murder case- had been later posted to the Sri Lankan Embassy in Germany by the then Defence Ministry officials.? ?
Meanwhile, former Crime OIC Mt. Lavinia SI, Tissasiri Sugathapala in his statement to the CID states that he had to remove four pages from the GCIB and handed them over to the DIG together with Wickrematunge?s notebook
Udalagama, who was in charge of former MP Karuna Amman?s security at the time of his alleged involvement in abducting a witness, had been posted to Germany temporarily by creating a new post to provide security to a certain official by the then Defence Ministry officials. Although this particular official returned after his assignment overseas, Udalagama had remained in Germany for another two years.? ?
According to what the CID informed court, when Udalagama was under arrest, the former Chief of National Intelligence at the Ministry of Defence, Kapila Hendawithana, had once made a request to the then Foreign Ministry to purchase three tickets for Udalagama?s wife and two children to visit Germany which request was declined by the Foreign Ministry. However under extraordinary circumstance, on the directives of a top official, the Foreign Ministry had purchased the air tickets for Udalagama?s family since Udalagama?s children were at home for the school vacation. It was revealed that Udalagama was given a separate apartment in Germany and all his food and lodging was paid for by the Government of Sri Lanka.? ?
The CID meanwhile had obtained permission of the court to record a statement from former DIG Prasanna Nanayakkara and a further statement by former Crime OIC Tissasiri Sugathapala while they were in remand prison. The two are to be produced in Mt. Lavinia Magistrate Court on March 29.? ? ?

For N. Korean leaders, a train unlike any other
	
?
THE HINDU, 27th MARCH, 2018-When North Korea?s leaders need to travel, they?ve got a train that?s unlike any other.
No surprise, then, that the appearance in Beijing on Monday of a deep green train with yellow piping that looked a lot like the one used exclusively by the ruling Kim family has generated so much speculation of a surprise visit by leader Kim Jong Un.
A day after the train was spotted pulling into the station in Beijing and amid reports it had already left on Tuesday afternoon, there was still no official word about who was aboard and why.
But if it was Kim Jong Un, it would be his first known trip outside of North Korea since the death of his father, Kim Jong Il, in December 2011.
And, oddly enough, it would be a pretty typical way for him to travel.
Just how often Kim Jong Un has used the train to get around inside North Korea isn?t known. But his father, who famously hated flying and had a penchant for a playboy lifestyle, is said to have decked the train out for lavish parties, bouts of heavy drinking and karaoke on his many journeys by rail.

Prof. Amarendra P.

During his visit Prof. Behera spoke to the?Daily Mirror on the growing importance of ICT and expressed India?s willingness to assist Sri Lanka in its endeavours to utilize ICT in the field of education.? ? ?
The excerpts:?
Q What is the role of technology in the education sector??
Technology has a great role to play in education, starting from the teaching-learning process itself. Information and Communications Technology (ICT) can unburden children from the heavy curriculum and make the teaching-learning experience more interactive, more enduring, and?more experiential.? ?
I can?t see how a bud blossoms into a flower with my naked eye. But if we video every fraction of a second then we can show the child how it happens. Environmentalists campaigning for a sustainable environment object to the dissection of frogs. In that case children need to know how to do it. So they can watch and learn through virtual dissection.? ?
Training teachers is also a challenge. We can train teachers using ICT. We can have a cumulative assessment of children and store the results. So data gathering, data storing, data retrieval becomes easy and instant. If a child is comparatively a slow learner the teacher can give some special classes, some special resources for the child. For instance, if I am a blind child, I cannot read a book. It has to be either in Braille or someone has to read it to me. So I can design talking books for visually impaired children.? ?
Q To what extent has ICT been used in the education sector in India??
In India there are two important schemes running in the school education sector. One is the CAL programme which is a computer assisted learning programme. As part of that programme 50 lakhs(INR) is spent on each district annually to provide ICT in schools.? ?
Similarly, we have the ICT @ Schools Schemes for secondary and senior secondary schools. This was launched in 2004. As part of that scheme each school should have a computer lab with a minimum of 10 computers, 2 MB/S internet connectivity, and training is provided to the teachers. Almost 50% of schools in India are covered by this scheme. The government of India has also created digital content through many agencies. Children can access the digital content through web portals, mobile apps, tablets, laptops etc.? ?
The child should also develop creativity so that the child can approach the content in multiple ways
	India is happy to provide any support to develop educational portal to facilitate the teaching-learning process in?Sri Lanka
Q Have any surveys been carried out to assess whether there has been an improvement in the competence of students after?introducing ICT?
Many surveys have been done and the result has been a mixed one. Infrastructure is provided, but the availability of internet is a challenge due to power cuts. If the connection is 2Mbps, downloading content?becomes problematic.? ?
Q Recently a program to provide A/L students with tabs was suspended in Sri Lanka. In a country like Sri Lanka- a developing country like India- where we talk of the lack of basic facilities in rural schools, do you think a program of this nature could actually benefit students??
ICT is a reality and it is going to stay for many years. Children need to master the 21st century skills. The child should have full blown language skills, be it Sinhala, Tamil or any other language. The child should also develop critical thinking. He or she must?question everything.? ?
The child should also develop creativity so that the child can approach the content in multiple ways. When we talk of creativity we speak of fluency, flexibility and originality. If the child has done a project on tsunami using ICT or watched 20 to 30 videos on it, and one day the child sees a change in tide, he or she can predict that a tsunami is on its way. The child can then warn others. That way children save many lives. So we have to develop critical thinking, problem solving and communication skills which are 21st century skills. ICT is required to develop these skills. Developing critical thinking, for instance, means you need to gather information on many things.? ?
Q Do you suggest that each student should have a tab?
Ideally, every child in a class should have a laptop or tab. Tabs are now not very costly.?
Q The TAB programme in Sri Lanka is also said to cost around Rs. 4 billion and that was one of the reasons as to why the programme was suspended. What are the cost-effective methods by which ICT can be incorporated into the education system??
We advocate for each child to have a tab so that it will be a personalized learning experience for the child. Under the ICT @ schools scheme funds are provided by the Government of India to all the states.? ?
Implementation of all the parameters of any project is vested with the states. Some are prompt in implementation and some take more time for implementation. It is the prerogative of the state to decide on the gadget. The Government of India has an open plan. States can provide laptops, desktops and tablets. For instance, suppose there are some remote schools. They might say it is difficult to maintain tabs. So they can opt for desktops.? ?
Q So the government has to provide financial support and also have to fulfil basic necessities in schools. How do you strike a balance here because sometimes the best schools would get all the resources while rural schools, for instance, would be left behind??
Whenever the government plans something, it is for all the schools because equity, equality and quality are equally important to the Government. So it?s not a case of the best school or worst school. Whenever the Government plans it provides basic amenities to all the schools.? ?
Q In practice do rural schools also benefit from this programme??
In practice it depends on the promptness of the system - how quickly they do it. Suppose it is a remote school. It will be difficult to find a supplier who can provide infrastructure and maintain them. So it is not a problem of the school or the government. It is a problem in the system.? ?
Q How could India assist Sri Lanka in revolutionizing the education sector with the use?of technology?
Sri Lanka is a SAARC country. It is a close neighbour of India. We would be happy to provide any support related to developing an educational portal to facilitate the teaching-learning process in Sri Lanka. We can help in digitizing text books in Sri Lanka. The National Institute of Education (NIE) in Sri Lanka is the agency to develop the syllabi and textbooks. We can help them. If the Government of Sri Lanka requests support we would be happy to support.

Implementing UN resolution--Progress slow: UK
	
Though Sri Lanka has achieved ?some small recent? progress in terms of implementing UN resolutions, British Minister for Asia and Pacific Mark Field said the progress had been slower than they would have anticipated or liked.
The Minister expressed these views during a debate held in British Parliament on March 20 over the Truth and Reconciliation Commission in Sri Lanka.
Responding to other members? queries during the debate, Minister Field said Sri Lanka?s co-sponsorship of UN Human Rights Council resolution in 2015 was a truly historic moment.
?It was, at least verbally, a strong commitment to addressing the legacy of its long-running and devastating civil war, a commitment subsequently extended by two years last year in resolution 34/1. Sri Lanka pledged to establish a commission for truth, justice, reconciliation and non-recurrence, to sit alongside other mechanisms as part of a comprehensive truth and justice process.
?We remain absolutely committed to the full implementation of those resolutions as the single best way to secure the lasting reconciliation and peaceful future that are in the interests of all Sri Lankans, and which they so richly deserve,? he said.
He said an Office on Missing persons is close to being operational and the Sri Lankan Government have passed a law to prevent and criminalise enforced disappearances.
?I understand that a draft law to establish an office of reparations has been approved by the Sri Lankan cabinet. I also understand that draft legislation for a truth-seeking commission?an important part of this whole process?has been prepared, drawing upon the work of a country-wide consultation taskforce,? he said.

Among those who initially decided to oppose the motion were Dumi from Rajarata, Appochchi Mala from Uva, Mahi from Kalutara and Sarath from Kandy.
However, they were reportedly saying that they would change their decision should a firm order come from above to vote for the motion.?
Meanwhile, the JO stalwarts who took the initiative to present the motion are sure that at least four or five Greens will vote for the motion.

Judicature (Amendment) Bill is nothing but political vendetta
	
Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) Chairman Prof. G.L. Peiris, in an?interview with Daily Mirror, discusses the implications of the Judicature (Amendment) Bill. Prof. Peiris shared the following:-
?
Similar offences charged against different people must be tried upon the same system
	New Bill is against the principles of equality
	Criminal law must apply to everyone alike
	Bill drafted to bring MR, family and political leaders before the tribunal
Q The government says the purpose of this Bill is to cleanse politics of corruption in this country. Then why do you oppose to it?
The Judicature (Amendment) Bill has nothing to do with catching thieves. It is a canard. This has nothing do with eradication of bribery and corruption from our society. The objective of this legislation is entirely different. It is nothing but political vendetta. The idea is simply to silence the political opponents who cannot be defeated at elections. The results of the local government elections, held on February 10, indicates very clearly what the public opinion is. The government , or President Maithripala Sirisena?s Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP), are fully aware that they cannot face an election with Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) or come anywhere near victory. Their determination, as a result, is to eliminate these people from the political stage and throw them up in jail. That is the long and broad target.? ?
Q But, there are instances where special tribunals have been set up in the past. Why do you object to them this time?
This country has a very unfortunate history with regard to special courts and special tribunals. We recall the dismal events connected to late Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike. We can recall the insults that were hurled at her. She was called ?Bindumathi?. The Ministers in the JR Jayewardene government said she would be dragged on the road in chains. She was convicted for offences which has no existence in the law. She went to the regular courts. She got relief. What happened? The JR government enacted legislation in Parliament to reverse the decisions of the court that gave her relief. Late Justice Wimalaratne, an illustrious judge in this country who gave her relief, was hauled before Parliament. The judge himself was tried before Parliament. The present Prime Minister was a member of the committee of Parliament appointed to try the Supreme Court Judges, Justice Wimalaratne, Justice Colin Thome and others.??
That was the behaviour of the UNP in the past. In this case, this Bill has been presented. We have challenged it in the Supreme Court. The oral argument has been concluded. The written submissions were filed on March 24. The decision is to be communicated to the President and the Speaker?next week.
The basic purpose of the legislation is to set up a permanent High Court at bar to conduct trials at bar. Trials at bar are nothing new in this country. That is very much a law in the established courts. With regard to the trial at bar, the procedure is for the Attorney General to make an application to the Chief Justice for the constitution of trial at bar. It is for the Chief Justice and the Chief Justice alone to decide whether the circumstances warrant the establishment of a trial at bar. That requires the application of judicial might. The head of the judiciary is entrusted with that responsibility. Nobody else can make that decision. The whole concept of permanent trial at bar is anomalous and contrary to the principles of law.? ?
Q Why do you say so?
Trial at bar is a special institution. It is brought into place when the special circumstances require it. It is for the Chief Justice to decide whether the facts of a particular case justified the creation of a trial at bar. So far, the trial at bars had been established in respect of cases such as gruesome murders, sexual abuses, followed by Vidya?s gang rape and murder case in recent times. What is totally obnoxious is the effort to take away that discretion from the Chief Justice and to vest it in the executive.
If the proposed legislation is passed, then the Minister is given the power to establish these benches or these special courts. The Bill says there is no limit to the number of courts to be established. He can establish any number of these special courts. It is for the Minister to decide where this particular court sits. All of that is in the hands of the Minister. It is for the Attorney General or the Director General of Bribery Corruption and to decide what cases to be prosecuted before these special courts. That itself is contrary to principles. The Director General of Bribery Corruption is not even appointed by the Constitutional Council. It is an executive appointment, entirely in the hands of the?political executive.? ?
The country is fully aware of the top ten initiatives headed by MP Mahindananda Aluthgamage. The most serious allegations were made against the Cabinet Ministers of the present government. Facts and figures were presented. Very strong evidence was presented before the Bribery and Corruption Commission. But, nothing whatever happened.? ?
Look at the serious allegations made by Deputy Minister Ranjan Ramanayake! There was the situation involving COPE. The COPE members, while they were investigating Perpetual Treasuries, made hundreds of telephone calls to its owner Arjun Aloysius. The Ministers of the cabinet admitted that they met Arjun Aloysius face to face. It transpired that Perpetual Treasuries had 22 bank accounts, but they purchased Mendis Distilleries. It was the account of Mendis Distilleries that was used to pay bribes. There is reason to believe that. That was the allegation that was made from within the government. It was alleged that Rs.1,200 million was spent out of that bank account. Some of these withdrawals took place during the time when the COPE members were either meeting Perpetual Treasuries or having telephone communications with them. All the money has been taken out of that account. The Bribery and Corruption Commission has a duty to investigate this matter. Parliamentarian Ramanayake said the Central Bank fraud was nothing compared with other frauds which are currently taking place. He referred to a situation involving?Sri Lanka Cricket.? ?
Isn?t that a paramount duty of the Bribery Commission to investigate these matters? What is the Commission?doing about it???
Our complaint is basically? that this legislation involves procedures which are highly selective. It is the Director General of Bribery and Corruption to identify the people to be prosecuted or the cases to be brought before this special tribunal. A sacred principle of our law is equality. The criminal law must apply to everyone alike. Similar offences charged against different people must be tried upon the same system. Suppose the persons A and B are charged for the same offence, but A is tried by the regular court and B by the specially created court! That is discrimination. That is contrary to the principle of equality enshrined in Article 12 of the Constitution.
The offences on which this trial at bar can be constituted are set out in the sixth schedule. That covers a very wide range of offences. Again, whether a particular offence or offender should be tried before a regular High Court or special High Court depends entirely on the whims and fancies of the Director General of Bribery and Corruption.? ?
That strike at the very root of the system of criminal justice that prevails in this country. What we are saying is that this is not what it pretends to be. There is pretense to clean up politics of this country. On the contrary, what is sought to be done is to introduce corruption into judiciary. That would be a great pity because that will destroy an institution which the public of Sri Lanka up to this time had great confidence. Our judges and courts have been held in the highest esteem all over the world. Now what is sought to be done is to introduce politicization.??
Q But, those who lobby for this Bill say there is a backlog of cases for 17 years. The country needs to dispense with these cases. What is your view on this?
There are people who have been languishing in jail for 10 or 12 years. There are 11000 people in remand custody. There are thousands of people who have been denied bail. Why is this bill not concerned with these?people then???
When you use the High Court judges for these special courts, the regular functions of High Courts will suffer. If a man has to suffer in remand custody for ten years, he will now have to languish in custody for 15 years.? ?
This law is not applicable to serious offices such as murders, kidnapping, rape etc. If the idea is to create the backlog, we have to clear it with regard to the most serious offences. Why is no attention paid to that at all???
The only intention of those who drafted this Bill is to bring the Rajapaksa family and the leaders of the political parties opposed to them before this special tribunal.? ?
Q Don?t? you see the need for any special mechanism to deal with corruption?
We are not objecting to those mechanisms. They must be entirely within the control of judiciary. Trial-at-Bar is also a special mechanism. We are not objecting to Trial-at-Bar as long as it is in the hands of the Chief Justice.? ? ?

Kushner under investigation by the White House

REUTERS, 27th MARCH, 2018-The White House is investigating whether two loans totaling more than $500 million to the family real estate business of U.S. President Donald Trump?s son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner violated any criminal laws or regulations, according to the U.S. Office of Government Ethics.
Democratic lawmakers asked the White House and Kushner Cos for documents after the New York Times last month reported the loans extended in 2017 by Citigroup Inc (C.N) and the private equity firm Apollo Global Management.
In a letter to a congressman made public on Monday, David Apol, acting director and general counsel of the Office of Government Ethics, said, ?I have discussed this matter with the White House Counsel?s Office in order to ensure that they have begun the process of ascertaining the facts necessary to determine whether any law or regulation has been violated.?
?During that discussion, the White House informed me that they had already begun this process,? Apol said in the letter dated March 22 to Democratic Representative Raja Krishnamoorthi.
Kushner?s lawyer Abbe Lowell and the White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

LankaPropertyWeb.com Celebrates 10th Year with Record Growth Figures
	
Company celebrates tenth birthday by posting record growth in users and leads in 2017
Number of leads generated, and properties sold through the website displays the unparalleled opportunities it provides both sellers and landlords
Sri Lanka?s leading real estate website, LankaPropertyWeb.com, recorded another successful year in 2017, showing an extraordinary growth in traffic and other vital metrics to the website. Buoyed by the demand for rentals, new developments and sales, the website has recorded a significant increase in the number of users, visits, duration of the visit and most importantly, in the number of leads generated to advertisers and closed sales and lets.
With close to 2 million users conducting around 4 million visits and over 17,000 advertisersposting their properties or offering a variety of property-related services, the website continues to be the ?go to place? for prospective and serious customers, including both buyers and sellers of real estate.?
At the end of December 2017, LankaPropertyWeb.com had recorded a percentage growth of 22 percent in the total number of visits to the site, compared to the previous year.This growth in the visits is underlined by the 18% growth recorded in the number of users; while the company recorded a little over 1.6 million users by the end of 2016, this had grown to 1.94 million users by the end of 2017.? With increases in both users and the visits, notably the duration of the visitshad also increased, indicating an overall percentage growth of 18 percent. In short, the duration of a visit increases as the website is able to offer more options and choices for the users to browse and select from. It is also proof that the users have shown a keen interest on the properties advertised.
In addition to the traffic, another notable achievement is a staggering 61% increase in the number of leads for the advertisements posted on the website.? A lead is recognised as a visitor contacting an advertiser via email or telephone after seeing the advertisement on the site. This would mean advertisers on the site received 932,996 leads overall for the ads that they had placed.? Once a lead has been established, the next important step is closing the deal: 54% of advertisers have said that they have managed to sell or rent their property via LankaPropertyWeb.com. According to Alexa Rankings, the website has also managed to increase the gap with competitors, with a 3x gap with the closestcompetitor forwebsite visits.
The simplicity and user-friendly design of the website was duly recognised when it was adjudged the Winner of the Best Website in the Professional Services Category at the SLT Zero-One Awards 2017. This fact appears evident especially in the growing popularity of the website with mobile users. With the promise of ease of access and convenience, the number of mobile users had increased by 39 percent, growing to over 1.2 million users by 2017.?
In addition to offering a wide range of property options, for sale or rent, the site also offers additional property-related services and information. These include a house price index, the tracking of the average property prices in Sri Lanka and guides and tools such as a Mortgage calculator and guides to locals and foreigners on navigating Sri Lanka?s property related legal framework.??
Behind the success of the site has also been the company?s ability to identify the changing trends in the sector and responding to these by adapting its services accordingly.?
?We keep a keen eye on these changing dynamics. The sector has remained vibrant and interest in real estate continues to be really high, especially regarding new developments. For us, it is extremely important that we offer a user-friendly platform through the website and that we keep things simple and user-friendly. What is unique is also that we offer a comprehensive list of services, so in a sense, we have created a virtual one-stop-shop for those interested in the real estate sector.? This, I believe, has greatly helped us carve a niche in the property sector and helped us win the trust of both the users and the advertisers.?
The figures for 2017 shows that not only does the website bring in the visitors, but it also delivers on the vitals that are important for both sellers and landlords, by generating leads and providing leads resulting in a majority of advertisers managing to sell or rent the properties.? stated Daham Gunaratna, Managing Director of Lanka Property Web.?
With several property-related events and product launches planned for 2018, including hosting theLanka Property show for the second time this year, Lanka Property Web is anticipating continued growth of the sector. The company will continue to improve its technology and services to the users, helping them at each step of their property buying and selling process and by doing so,keep them abreast of the changing trends in the sector in 2018.?

The recently held Local Government poll was a crime of national proportion and a grave mistake committed by the two main parties to the nation, Home Affairs Minister Vajira Abeywardana said today.
The comment was made in relation to the numerous political clashes taking place in the country, as parties struggle to retain power in several local government bodies.
?Not only the LG poll is a crime, it is also a crime that no one is coming forward to voice against this. The main two parties of the government; the UNP and the SLFP, should take responsibility for the repercussions of this electoral system. This grave mistake we committed should be rectified,? he told a news briefing held at Sirikotha.
He said the maintenance expenses of the LG polls doubled with the new electoral system as the number of councillors increased exorbitantly. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Mobitel takes the lead in helping combating Dengue among school children with the  ?DengueFreeChild?
	
(From Left) Mr. Sunil Hettiarachchchi, Secretary ? Ministry of Education, Mr. P. G. Kumarasinghe Sirisena, Chairman ? Sri Lanka Telecom & Mobitel and Dr. Sarath Amunugama, Deputy Director General, Public Health Services officially launching the ?DengueFreeChild? app.
Mobitel, Sri Lanka?s National Mobile Service Provider, launched an innovative mobile app to help combat the spread of Dengue among school children in Sri Lanka at a special event held at the BMICH on 27 March 2018.
The ?DengueFreeChild? app was developed by Mobitel in collaboration with the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Health, the University of Colombo and Nanyang Technological University in Singapore. The app enables users to proactively report of Dengue or suspected Dengue fever so that action can be taken to the premises around which the infection is prevalent for mosquito breeding areas as well as to alert other parents to keep a keen eye on Dengue-like symptoms in their own children.
Around 30 percent of all Dengue patients who sought treatment in 2017 were children, according to the data collected by the National Dengue Control Unit of the Ministry of Health.?
?Early diagnosis of Dengue can save a child?s life,? says Dr. Hasitha Tissera, National Coordinator of the National Dengue Control Unit. ?We have found that early diagnosis of Dengue and immediate treatment almost always leads to a complete recovery. The need for parents and carers to be alert and aware of the possibility of Dengue symptoms in their children cannot be overstated.?
Recent statistics revealed that there are nearly 4.4 million students in more than 10,000 schools across Sri Lanka today. As the Dengue mosquito is reported to be active during the morning hours, students are all at greater risk of being infected if mosquito breeding grounds exist in schools and surrounding areas. The app creates awareness and allows sharing of information quickly that enables parents and school authorities to take preventive action to stop the spread of Dengue. Ministry of Education through Health and Nutrition Division is actively contributing to maintain schools free of dengue breeding sites. Therefore, this new app will help them to monitor the situation more closely.
The ?DengueFreeChild? app has been created with separate user access for government officials and school authorities, in addition to the general public use of sharing and accessing information about Dengue patients.
?Dengue has become a critical national health issue, and as the National Mobile Service Provider, we had a responsibility to find ways to combat this disease,? says Isuru Dissanayake - Senior General Manager Marketing, Mobitel. ?We are proud to collaborate with the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Health, the University of Colombo and Nanyang Technological University in Singapore to design and develop this timely and much-needed application. It gives us immense satisfaction to leverage on our specialized mobile technology to enhance the wellbeing of the children of our country.??
The ?DengueFreeChild? app is now available for free download by Android Users on Google Play Store.

No confidence leads to a family quarrel!
	
?
The no confidence against Number Two has led to a bitter row between the father and the son in a well-known political family, they say.
?
The father -son team once active in the previous regime had later played a prominent role in the struggle to usher in yahapalanaya. They both made it to Diyawanna at the last general polls from two different districts as the Green front members.
The father is now holding a key portfolio in the top team. He is in the forefront in the fight to protect the Green leader.
The son has taken up the stance that if the Green party is to forge ahead there should be a change of heads at the top of the party pyramid. So he is dead set to vote for the no confidence.
Both the father and the son ? both known to be hard nuts to crack ? are not prepared to budge an inch from the respective positions they have taken up on the no confidence issue, they say.

Even the Field Marshal has reportedly expressed his willingness to come forward again should there be a popular demand for his candidacy, they say.
Meanwhile, an unexpected ?horse? has announced his intention to enter the race. He is none other than Green party stalwart who lost his key portfolio in the recent past. A great believer in the never-say-die approach, the man has now decided to make a try at the much coveted high office come 2020.
While waiting for an auspicious moment, he had seen the aftermath of the recent turmoil in Kandy district as a godsend to make a start to establish his credentials as an ideal candidate for the coveted high office. So he had visited the area and distributed relief packs to the affected families. However, he is still clueless as to how he should enter the race given the likelihood of the Green party refusing to own him, they say.

Reviving education in North will take years: PM
	
It would take at least another ten years to revive the fallen education system in the North, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said today.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe expressed this sentiment during a ceremony held at Temple Trees distribute permanent appointment letters to nearly 400 teachers in the North last morning
?The whole system of education in the North had fallen today. What have to do is to lay the foundation stone to revive this system in the province. It will take time,? he said.
?I cannot say we can do this in one year as it will take at least ten years. We have to introduce a new education system within the next ten years. There should be a familiar system for the North. We need the support of retired principals and teachers to do it. I have requested the Minister of Education to get the support of the Provincial Council to set up a new education programme for the province. However, one cannot give a dead line for it,? the Prime Minister said.
?It is a duty of the Government to grant appointments as permanent teachers to those who have worked under volunteer and contract basis in the Northern Province for a long time.
?The granting of permanent appointments to teachers will not end today as there are more to be made permanent. Most of these who are got appointments today worked at the Northern schools during war time.
?Others came during the post war period when there was a shortage of teachers in the province. There was no method of recruitment at that time while some did not have enough qualifications to become permanent teachers. However many persons helped to resolve the teacher shortage in the province during difficult times. Thanks very much for your commitment. Leader of Opposition, Governor of Northern province, Minister of education and the state Minister of education were keen to resolve this issue,? he added.
Mr. Wickremesinghe said the standard of education was very high in the North before the war and during his tenure as the Minister of Education.
?Education in Colombo was also of high standard. Gampaha was second. Then there is Kandy and Galle in the ranks. Education in Jaffna is on a standstill. There are a number of districts in the country where the education is of higher standards compared to Jaffna,? he also said.
Governor of Northern Province Reginald Cooray said the Government had understood the importance of reviving the education system in the North. ?North was the foremost place of Sri Lanka?s education in the past but the education sector had come down during the war. President Regime had decided to put things right,? he said.
Minister of Education Akila Viraj Kariyawasam said the decision was made to provide permanent appointments to Northern teachers after discussions with the Public service commission.
He said temporary appointments were given to teachers in the North as there were issues pertaining to procedures.
State Minister of Education V. Radhakrishnan said it was the people in the North who were against helping the province and not those from the South.
He said some in the education sector, who are against giving these appointments and were carrying out continuous protests in the North. (Yohan Perera)

## Title: Smith,Warner banned from playing for Australia for 1 year

Smith,Warner banned from playing for Australia for 1 year
	
Steve Smith and David Warner have been banned from playing for Australia for 12 months as a result of Cricket Australia's investigation into the ball-tampering incident, the ABC's chief cricket commentator Jim Maxwell understands.
Maxwell said a source close to Smith had confirmed the bans to him.
"I understand that Steve Smith and David Warner are getting a 12-month ban from the game in Australia," he said.
"I don't know how that affects them elsewhere in the world, but I understand that is the nature of the penalty, the sanction as they like to call it."
He said he does not know the fate of the third Australian sent home, opener Cameron Bancroft.
Cricket Australia (CA) is expected to confirm the penalties for all three players later today.
CA boss James Sutherland announced this morning that Warner, Smith and Bancroft would be sent home over their roles in the ball-tampering scandal that has rocked Australian cricket.
The scandal broke after Bancroft was caught on camera using tape to rough up the ball in the third Test in Cape Town.
Darren Lehmann remains as Australia's coach, despite media reports he was set to resign over the ball-tampering incident, with wicket-keeper Tim Paine taking over as captain.
Matthew Renshaw, Glenn Maxwell and Joe Burns have been named as replacements for Smith, Warner and Bancroft.
Sutherland said the saga was extraordinarily bad for cricket, but repeatedly refused to say whether the attempts to alter the match ball constituted cheating.
He apologised to the Australian public and said he shared the anger and disappointment of cricket supporters, especially children who idolise the players.
And he said the pressure had taken a heavy toll on Smith.
"He is destroyed, very upset," Sutherland said.
Earlier this week, the International Cricket Council announced it would ban Smith for one match and fine him all of his match fee.
Bancroft was fined 75 per cent of his match fee and received three demerit points. But, it was not enough to satisfy critics of the team.
The ball-tampering scandal saw Bancroft attempt to hide the tape from umpires after appearing to run it over the ball.
The incident proved to be a crippling distraction for the team as they lost by a mammoth 322 runs at Newlands.
Smith initially confessed he and his leadership group instructed Bancroft to tamper with the ball on day three.
As vice-captain, Warner was a key cog in that leadership group. During his post-play press conference, Smith refused to "name names" when queried who in the leadership group discussed tampering with the ball.
But given the three players sent home, it would appear Smith's phrasing referred to just himself and Warner.
The incident has also shaken the public's trust in the team, for so long held up on a pedestal for its supposed hard-but-fair approach to the game.(ABC News)

Speaker to get powers of Prez, PM if No-Faith Motion wins: Minister
	
Home Affairs Minister Vajira Abeywardana yesterday said Speaker Karu Jayasuriya would be bestowed with the powers of both the President and the Prime Minister in the event the No-Faith Motion against the Premier was won by those who brought it.
According to the 19th Amendment to the Constitution, the Minister said a No-Faith Motion could not be brought against the Premier but against the entire Government.
?There is no legal provision in the Constitution to bring a No-Faith Motion targeting only the Prime Minister, it should be brought against the entire Government,? he said.
?We are optimistic we can defeat this motion. However, if the No-Faith Motion could not be defeated, the Speaker could get the President?s and Premier?s powers with the consultation of the Attorney General,? he told a news briefing held at Sirikotha.
He said the 81 (1) Paragraph of the Constitution said an MP could be expelled if he was found guilty by a President?s Commission but said the PCoI into Central Bank Bond Scam had not levelled charges against the Premier.
He also said according to the Paragraph 81 (2), any proposal against an MP should be presented to the Speaker only with the approval of the Cabinet and by the Prime Minister.
?However, the Constitution enables the bringing in of a no-confidence motion against the government as a whole but not against a certain MP or the Premier,? he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

We will soon have artificial rain: Power and Energy Ministry
	
In a bid to find a sustainable solution to the recurring droughts, the next few months would witness the first onset of artificial rain in selected areas of the country as a pilot project, Power and Energy Ministry Secretary Suren Batagoda said.
He told Daily Mirror the Ministry had decided to introduce ?Artificial Rains? for the first time in Sri Lanka with technical support from the Bureau of Royal Rainmaking and Agricultural Aviation (BRRAA) of Thailand.
?A team of experts on artificial rain-making led by the Director General of BRRAA visited Sri Lanka last month and had several rounds of talks with the Ministry and the CEB. We are confident that Sri Lanka would benefit if the pilot project is a success and artificial rain-making can be made a permanent solution to the repeated droughts that have had a negative impact on the country,? Dr. Batagoda said.
Cabinet approval has been granted for an Environment Impact Assessment on the project with the assistance of experts of the subject, and an MOU on the project is to be signed shortly, between the Ministry of Power and Renewable Energy and BRRAA and that Sri Lankan officials would visit Thailand to study the rain-making project.
"The first artificial rain project will be carried out in the catchment basins of the four major reservoirs namely Castlereagh, Victoria, Kotmale and Mausakelle and depending on the success of the pilot project, it would be extended to other drought-hit areas of the country," Dr. Batagoda said.
He said the Power and Renewable Energy Ministry did not intend increasing power tariffs this year despite the on-going drought in many parts of the country.
"Only 40% of the total power generation is provided through hydropower at the moment and the remaining 60% is supplied mainly from the costly thermal power obtained from private power suppliers and renewable energy. As a result of the excessive heat generated by the drought, March 20 had recorded a supply of 2,500 MWs from the CEB. But we cannot provide an uninterrupted power supply throughout the year unless we do not dramatically increase the generation of alternative energy which is not possible in a short period of time. Besides, it needs major investments. That is why we have decided to try our luck on artificial rain," Power and Renewable Energy Minister Ranjith Siyambalapitiya said. (Sandun A. Jayasekera)
