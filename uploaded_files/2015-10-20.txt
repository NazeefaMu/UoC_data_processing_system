5 Lankans reach TN using high-speed boat
	
	Five persons were suspected to have arrived onboard a high-speed fibre glass boat from Sri Lanka that was found abandoned at a coastal village near in Rameswaram last week, a top Tamil Nadu police official said today.
	"We suspect that five persons had arrived by the boat which was found abandoned in Narikuzhi village. We are confident of nabbing them," Additional Director General of Police, Coastal Marine Police, Shylendra Babu told reporters.
	The high-speed boat fitted with a powerful outboard motor and registered in Sri Lanka was seized off Narikuzhi village by coastal marine police on October 13.
	The ADGP, who came Rameswaram to inspect the Coastal areas, said that the patrolling of the coastal areas would improve further with the proposal to buy a Rs 20 crore patrol boat shortly.
	Besides, a strength of the Coastal Marine police would be increased at nearby Olaikuda area from where smuggling of ganja had been reported, he said.
	He warned that those indulged in ganja smuggling or any other goods to Sri Lanka would be detained under non-bailable offence. (business-standard)

A ploy to escape the wrath of erstwhile mates
	
This stocky politico from down South better known for his shenanigans than for his work for the people was once a prominent follower of the former strongman.
?
He too received a consolation position at the distribution of plums by the Yahapalanaya. ?And this ?sell-out? angered his erstwhile mates with whom he ganged up against the new strongman at the recent national polls. Soon he found himself at the receiving end of jibes and abusive epithets from them. ?The politico later hit upon a plan to keep his detractors at bay. He called the former strongman over the phone. ?Sir, I am in a hell of a fix,? he told the former mentor. ?You are my only savior. You alone can rescue me. All my longstanding colleagues are at my neck for joining the yahapalanaya as a deputy. ?Sir, please tell them I accepted this position after consulting you??
The former strongman said briefly: ?Hm! Okay!? and rang off, they say.

Video: Canadian Liberal Party wins in federal elections
	
	Canada's Liberal Party was headed for victory over the incumbent Conservatives of Stephen Harper, major news outlets said, based on early counts in the east of the country.
	The Liberals, led by Justin Trudeau, the eldest son of former Liberal prime minister Pierre Trudeau, had 126 confirmed seats and were leading in another 60, giving them a likely total of 186, comfortably above the 170 needed for a majority, CBC reports online.
	The Conservatives were second on 70 confirmed, and leading in 36 for a total of 106 seats. CTV News projected the party would form the official opposition.
	A jubilant crowd at the Liberal Party election headquarters at Montreal's Montreal'l Fairmount Queen Elizabeth Hotel, famous for John Lennon's and Yoko Ono's Bed-in for Peace in 1969, cheered as CTV News, CBC and Global called in the Liberal victory.
	When the election was called on August 2nd, many pundits had predicted an Orange Tsunami, a crushing wave of New Democratic Party (NDP) members of parliament with their trademark orange banners sweeping aside Canada's traditional parties - the Conservatives and the Liberals - for a brighter, more equal future.
	But as polling stations in eastern Canada started reporting their numbers early in the night it was a tidal wave of Liberal red that swept through Atlantic Canada, with Trudeau's troops capturing all 34 seats in the region.
	About 25 million voters were eligible to cast their ballots across the six time zones from Halifax to Vancouver.
	NDP leader Tom Mulcair, last seen in third place in the polls, could end up being the big loser with his leftist party losing seats nationally and in the French-speaking province of Quebec, where the NDP drew most of its support during the previous election in 2011, unseating the Liberals to become the official opposition in the House of Commons.
	Trudeau, has promised to run three consecutive deficits of a "modest" 10 billion Canadian dollars (7.8 billion US dollars) a year to kick-start the sputtering economy.
	Harper campaigned on a traditional Conservative platform of balancing the budget, tax cuts for the middle class and security both at home and internationally.
	It has been a difficult slog for the 56-year-old Conservative leader, whose 10-year stint as prime minister coincided with the worst global economic crisis since the Great Depression and led to the disappearance of hundreds of thousands of manufacturing jobs.
	Even more troubling for Harper, whose political support is based in oil- and gas-rich Western Canada, has been the steep decline in oil prices and other commodities that were fuelling Canada's growth until recently.
	Harper has had to fend off attacks from his political rivals who have labelled him the prime minister "with the worst job creation record since the Great Depression" and savaged him on Canada's slow response to the Syrian refugee crisis.
	Mulcair, a feisty 60-year-old former Quebec environment minister of mixed Irish and French-Canadian ancestry, fought his campaign on a message of "true change," promising a national childcare system, investment in public transport, education and Aboriginal communities, commit to drastically lower greenhouse gas emissions, and end Ottawa's military campaign against the Islamic State militant group.
	Canada is taking part in the US-led bombing campaign of Islamic State targets in Iraq and Syria, and Canadian special forces are training Iraqi and Kurdish fighters.

## Title: DFCC BANK turns 60 this month
## Section: Financial News

DFCC BANK turns 60 this month
	
		 		 
		 
			
By Special Correspondent?
DFCC BANK PLC celebrates its 60th birthday this month. It is customary on occasions such as this to reflect on the years that have passed, the challenges faced, the successes and the key landmarks of the journey. However, at this historic moment, it is far more pertinent to comment on a new development that will no doubt change the course of the bank?s operations, a new beginning that considerably enhances the stature, reach and financial strength of DFCC: the merger with the bank?s almost wholly owned subsidiary, DFCC Vardhana Bank.
DFCC was founded in 1955 and is one of the oldest development banks in Asia. The mandate from the beginning was to focus on development for the benefit of the nation.
DFCC has for six decades been the quiet but effective strength behind many trail-blazing entrepreneurs, especially in their early and risky start-up stages. Today many of them are leading players in sectors such as agriculture, apparel, construction, food and beverages, healthcare, manufacturing, power, telecom and tourism. They have directly or indirectly enhanced the well-being of the entire nation and its citizenry. DFCC is justifiably proud of its unpretentious history in this success story.
As important is the pioneering role that DFCC has played in leading the development of key sectors such as small and medium enterprises, resort hotels, mobile telecommunication and more recently renewable energy. In recent times DFCC also ventured into new and complementary areas of business such as investment banking, unit trusts, stockbroking, venture capital, industrial estate management, consulting and IT services.
Throughout, the bank has been extremely conscious of changing and new realities, adapting and evolving and yet remaining unwavering in its commitment to the development mandate. It was thus in early 2000 that DFCC decided to embark on a journey of transformation where it evolved into a financial services group which culminated with the acquisition of Merc Bank, previously known as the National Enterprise Bank, set up in 1996. ? A month later, in September 2003, it was rebranded as DFCC Vardhana Bank. DFCC Vardhana Bank functioned as DFCC?s 99.17 percent owned commercial banking subsidiary, a unique model which provided for diversification and a more prudent balance of risk and return.
With a history of just 12 years, Vardhana is a vibrant and efficient bank, known for its outstanding contribution and customer service. This is why it is widely accepted as Sri Lanka?s most trusted and caring bank, as well as the country?s fastest growing bank. At the time it merged with DFCC, its assets were almost Rs.120 billion- the fastest bank to reach the Rs.100 billion mark in 11 short years.
The vast experience of DFCC and the phenomenal rise of Vardhana made an amalgamation logical and indeed inevitable. The two entities have worked hard since January this year to ensure the merger was seamless and did not disrupt the operations of either bank. They dedicated themselves to making this happen and drove the process forward, sometimes under very difficult conditions. The amalgamated bank is a full-service bank with a distinct development bias. The combined size and reach of the amalgamated entity and the synergies created will enable DFCC to deliver sustainable solutions for all stakeholders by creating a powerful platform for growth.
This is why, on the occasion of completing 60 years, we are compelled to leave aside our history and focus on the strengths of the new DFCC BANK. Indeed it is that history which makes this possible and makes the new bank a game-changer. Our past influences our future, and who we were predicates what we will become- the best of both worlds. It is a commercial bank, with the rich experience of six decades of helping the nation?s industries grow, a trusted name now able to offer all services and conveniences to our clients.
Several factors had to come together to yield this happy outcome. Apart from experience and expertise, exceptional leadership was a critical factor. DFCC was led by Arjun Fernando, a quiet, hardworking, dignified man who could fight tenaciously without even seeming to fight. His counterpart in Vardhana, Lakshman Silva in contrast is a flamboyant character, a fighter and an achiever of no less merit.
The merger brings these two extraordinary leaders in the industry into a single team, the former as CEO and the latter as Deputy CEO. It is a phenomenal combination whichever way you want to look at it. They are different in their ways and in their expertise and will no doubt complement one another and help the amalgam reach its full potential. The merger then not only brings together two strong brands and institutions but puts in a single team of exceptional leaders with strong and proven credentials. They are moreover, backed by a staff endowed with seriousness of purpose, long experience, knowledge and commitment to the organisation. In fact it cannot be overstated that the success of DFCC and Vardhana is in great measure due to the human resources that overwhelmingly privilege deed over word.
They are also happily privileged to have in Royle Jansz a dynamic Chairman who has the experience, expertise and the leadership to maintain coherence and focus. ?He is a bold, methodical and committed man who enjoys the respect and has the confidence of the entire staff. He is the ideal man to oversee the operations of two strong financial institutions that have decided to journey together.
This historic merger will no doubt expand the scope of overall operations while resulting in a significant drop in costs. It will enable lending at competitive rates while providing faster and efficient services offering customers a wide range of technology-based and IT-based products. In short the amalgam would have a development banking focus with commercial banking facilities.
The DFCC group currently enjoys a fair share in the financial industry. As the gelling of the two entities moves towards completion, DFCC will in all likelihood surprise both the competition and the customers. The commitment to excellence, emphasis on professionalism, loyalty to the company and other complementary attributes clearly indicate even better days to come.
Therefore, this diamond jubilee constitutes a double celebration. First, a long journey of commitment to development and nation building upon which one can only look back with satisfaction and even incredulity. ?Secondly, the laying of a foundation for a new partnership that rededicates DFCC to its mandate while expanding its scope of operations with the ultimate objective of serving better the nation?s development needs and the banking needs of the citizens. It is a challenge certainly, but one which is embraced with the confidence that can only come from deep engagement, long experience and exceptional skills acquired over the years.

There were several Betel leaf stalwarts who posed a bold challenge to the new strongman at both recent polls. Among them were a Chief Ministerial one and a local politico presiding over the affairs of a town lying on the city fringe. Of the two, the local one had been the harsher detractor. Both are die-hard loyalists of the deposed strongman.?
Quite recently the duo called on the new strongman, of course, at the latter?s invitation. The new strongman who seemed to have forgotten the differences of the recent past had a friendly chat with the duo and finally sought their opinion on how to win the upcoming local polls.?
While expressing their opinion on the winning formula they had said: ?It is important that we invite all our estranged stalwarts back to the fold and withdraw all legal action taken against them. And the support of the former boss is the most important factor.?
The new strongman, according to informed sources, gave them an attentive hearing, but studiously avoided making a comment.

	In the wake of a request made by the Japanese Prime Minister, Sri Lanka is likely to obtain the services of a Japanese judge for the investigation into alleged human rights violations during the armed conflict.
	In a statement on his recent visit to Japan, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe told Parliament that his Japanese counterpart Shinzo Abe had informed him that it would be best of Sri Lanka to obtain the services of Japanese Judge Moto Noguchi who had participated in the investigations carried out by the Missing Persons Commission headed by retired judge Maxwell Paranagama.
	He said the Japanese Premier said Mr. Noguchi worked in Sri Lanka before and had also participated in war crimes investigations in Cambodia.
	Mr Wickremesinghe recalled that it was former president Mahinda Rajapaksa who had obtained the services of Mr Noguchi to advise Commission last year.
	He said the Japanese Prime Minister had also assured his support for a domestic truth commission.
	Mr. Wickremesinghe said Japan had welcomed the balanced foreign policy of Sri Lanka and pledged assistance worth 45 billion yen to develop the Bandaranaike International Airport at Katunayake and convert Sri Lanka into an aviation hub while enabling the transfer of technology.
	He said the two leaders had also discussed defense activities in the Indian Ocean. (Yohan Perera and Kelum Bandara)

Sangaree?s son elected to Canadian parliament
	
Tamil United Liberation Front (TULF) leader V. Anandasangaree?s son Gary Anandasangaree has won the new riding of Scarborough-Rouge Park for the Liberal party, beating the Conservatives after the party dropped candidate Jerry Bance late in the campaign.
Anandasangaree surged ahead of the the other candidates with an overwhelming majority of the vote. Conservative Leslyn Lewis came in a distant second, followed by NDP candidate Rev. Kantharatnam Shanthikumar.
The riding was thought to be a close three-way race, but Bance was dropped in September after he was reportedly caught on camera urinating in a coffee cup in 2012 in a highly publicized scandal.
The departure of Bance left the party scrambling to find a new candidate late in the race, opting for Lewis as a fill-in candidate.
The riding is brand new in this election and was created by combing pieces of three others: the eastern portion of what used to be Scarborough-Rouge River, the Scarborough portion of the former Pickering-Scarborough East and part of Scarborough-Guildwood.
Scarborough-Rouge Park stretches from York region south to Lake Ontario.
If the boundaries were the same in the 2011 federal election, voters would have voted 34.8 per cent Liberal, 31.6 per cent Conservative, and 31 per cent NDP. (Global News)

SL experts confirm bomb blast on Maldivian president?s speedboat
	
The explosion on the Maldivian president?s speedboat on September 28 was caused by a bomb targeting President Abdulla Yameen, an inquiry commission revealed today.
Home Minister Umar Naseer, who co-chairs the commission along with the president, told the press that a team of forensic experts from Sri Lanka who investigated the incident have confirmed that the blast was caused by an explosive device.
Forensic teams from the US, Saudi Arabia, Australia, and India flew in within a day of the blast, but has not yet shared their findings with the government. The Sri Lankan team is the first to deliver its forensic analysis report.
Dismissing claims that the blast was a mechanical failure, Naseer said: ?The blast is not related to the air-conditioning system in the boat. Our preliminary findings and the findings of the Sri Lankan team are that the blast was caused by a bomb.?
The blast occurred just as the ?Finifenma? speedboat was about to dock at the presidential jetty in Mal?. Yameen escaped unhurt, but First Lady Fathmath Ibrahim remains hospitalised with spine injuries. A presidential aide and a bodyguard were also injured.
Abdulla Nawaz, a senior police officer on the inquiry commission, said the Sri Lankan forensic experts detailed how they came to the conclusion that it was a bomb blast.
?However, at this stage of the investigation we cannot reveal more,? he said.
Naseer said the explosion went off underneath Yameen?s preferred seat on the speedboat. Fisheries Minister Dr Mohamed Shainee, who was on the speedboat, told local media last week that the first lady was sitting there when the blast occurred.
?This is the first time an attack was successfully executed targeting the president in the Maldives,? Naseer said.
Three soldiers have been arrested in the ongoing investigation. All three suspects are explosives experts. According to local media, they are accused of tampering with evidence.
Responding to a question by the The Maldives Independent, Nawaz said: ?I?m unable to state at the moment if evidence has been tampered with.?
?But if the evidence is under a particular party there are possibilities that they could destroy or tamper with it,? he added.
Suspicion has been cast on Vice President Ahmed Adeeb following police raids on the homes of his close associates and the administrative detention of his former military bodyguard.
A court warrant authorising the raid on the home of Hamid Ismail, an influential businessman related to Adeeb, was issued in connection to the blast on the speedboat.
On October 14, the police also raided the home of Abdulla Ziyath, a close associate of the vice president and the managing director of the Maldives Marketing and Public Relations Corporation (MMPRC).
Two days later, the MMPRC office was also raided. Ziyath has been questioned at the police headquarters twice this week.
Several senior government officials seen as loyal to the vice president have also been dismissed. Adeeb?s supporters are clashing acrimoniously with Yameen loyalists on social media.
Asked if the vice president is a suspect, Naseer said: ?We do not go after a person, we go after the evidence and that?s exactly what we are doing right now.?
President Yameen formed the inquiry commission a day after the blast with six high-ranking police and military officers. Today was the first time the commission met the press.
Defence Minister Moosa Ali Jaleel was sacked last week in a shakeup of the security services.
The former head of the Maldives National Defence Force?s special protection group, Ahmed ?Papa? Fayaz, is also being held in administrative detention. Fayaz was dismissed from his post shortly after the blast.
Naseer meanwhile vowed that the commission will find the perpetrators and bring them to justice.
?Attempting to kill the president is a huge crime, its treason. We will investigate, find out who did it and he will face the strictest punishment.? he said. (Maldives independent)

Video: Lawyers to file FR case against CID
	
	Attorney-at-law Udul Premaratne today appeared at the Sri Lanka Human Rights Commission (SLHRC), to forward a petition on behalf of Dunesh Priyashantha, alias ?Kondaya? against alleged abuse and the recording of a false statement by the Criminal Investigation Division (CID).
	Mr. Premaratne said by virtue of the fact that the Minuwangoda Magistrate decided to release Dunesh Priyashantha on Monday in connection with the murder of the four and a half year old girl in Kotadeniyawa, it meant that the statement that had been obtained by the CID on the 23rd of September, after the arrest on the 13th of September, was coerced.
	The statement that had been recorded by the CID was a detailed and illustrated version of the events that had unfolded on the night of the 12th of September 2015, Premaratne stated. "However if he had been released in connection with the rape and murder since his DNA did not match the samples obtained from the crime scene then the authenticity of the confession he had purportedly given is questionable."
	Mr. Premaratne raised the question as to how the suspect could have said such a descriptive lie, including the detailed events before the crime was committed. ?such details could only be known by the CID themselves?.
	?The CID should be responsible for the statement allegedly given by Dunesh? Mr. Premaratne said.
	He also stated that Dunesh Priyashantha had been assaulted for three days, after which he had been asked to sign the confession and upon refusing to do so he had been assaulted again.
	Premaratne further cautioned that this could happen to anyone and there was no protection of the law could have given to Dunesh Priyashantha since throughout the proceedings he had been with the CID.
	?Such a man like Dunesh who had his education only up to Grade 5 wouldn?t have the knowledge to demand his rights after being threatened with death?.
	He concluded that Dunesh Priyashantha had agreed to appear before the Commission at a later date and his team of lawyers were going to proceed with all available legal remedies including filing a fundamental rights case against the CID before the Supreme Court against the assault and the obtaining of false statements.

	Former External Affairs Minister, Prof. G.L. Peiris had written to the religious leaders including the Mahanayaka Theras informing them on the UNHRC resolution on Sri Lanka and requesting them to intervene to reject the resolution from being implemented.
	At a news conference held in Colombo today he said the UNHRC can only stress on violations of human rights but it cannot make a country to create political reforms or intervene into other internal matters.
	?If the mandate of the UNHRC is to make us do what they think is best, then what is the point of having a parliament in the country? ? he asked.
	He said the UNHRC has recommended through the resolution to abolish the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA), to appoint a special Court to hear alleged war crimes charges, to take measures for power devolution including land reforms, to decrease the role of army in the North and to regulate retrospective laws, which are against the mandate of the UNHRC.
	He said the intervention of foreign judges and prosecutors in the proposed war crime court, special office with foreign specialists to file indictments and proposed administrative investigations into security forces personnel even without charges cannot be accepted.
	?However, the government has co-sponsored the resolution with the US without opposing it. It has accepted the charges levelled through the resolution. The UNHRC Chief also said that the resolution is a rather unique? one as no country had backed such resolution in history. This decision of the government had also put the countries who had voted in favour of us at previous sessions in a difficult situation,? he said.
	He also said, now, the UNHRC has proposed for special criteria when deploying Sri Lankan security forces personnel for UN peacekeeping forces.
	Meanwhile, President's Counsel Manohara de Silva charged the government decision not to publish Paranagama and Udalagama reports at UNHRC, was due to the objection of the TNA. (Lahiru Pothmulla)
