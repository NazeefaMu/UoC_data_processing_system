Dollar will hit 160- Bandula
	
In an interview with the Daily Mirror the Joint Opposition?s Economic Affairs Spokesman, MP Bandula Gunawardane said that people would be compelled to endure economic hardships in the form of rising price and the lack of employment opportunities in the new year. He said it would not bode well for the country, because of budgetary provisions.Excerpts:* What kind of impact do the 2016 budgetary proposals will have on the country?s economy?
The originally estimated government?s revenue and expenditure, budget deficit and the way for financing it have now been changed because of amendments introduced during the debate in an unprecedented manner.
The budget lost its originality because of amendments brought in with the intervention of either the President or the Prime Minister. The government even lost its credibility because it failed to work out an acceptable budget at once.
If someone looks at it from the mindset of a frog in the well, it will be seen as a unique feature of Sri Lanka. Yet, the international financial organisations that observe budgetary financing and affairs and the local business community have been alarmed by what happened in the budget.
Especially, the Prime Minister presented a policy document ahead of the budget to draw the international attention to it. However, the entire policy statement was negated after the budget was presented together with amendments incorporated in the process.
It resulted in confusion. In that perplexed situation, the Finance Minister failed to act with responsibility and prudence, albeit it is what is expected from a member holding such a portfolio.
International Monetary Organisation (IMF) cautioned about certain proposals introduced due to personal interests of the government bigwigs. IMF warned of fragility in Sri Lankan economy in this context. IMF is duty-bound to make such economic forecasts because Sri Lanka holds IMF membership.
Whether we like or not, our country is doing export-import economic activities. Then, the balance of payment is part of our economy. The IMF contributes to maintaining the balance of payment and the stability of exchange rate at a healthy level.
That is why, there is an IMF office functioning under the Central Bank. It is unacceptable for anyone to dispute IMF articulating its position in this regard. We have already set a bad precedent. The rupee value has depreciated to the lowest in 38 years against the US dollar. It has depreciated during every rule. Yet, it stabilised after the end of war. During the post war period, the international official reserves were high. It stood at US $ 8.2 billion by the time of the government?s change. Within one year after the change, the rupee has depreciated to 151. It is bound to hit the 160 mark next year, according to economic forecasts.
The local economic scenario will be worst compounded by the decision of the United States to increase its interest rates last month.
In consequent to this move in the US, investors are now encouraged to withdraw their money invested in our bonds to be reinvested in US bonds. It is more profitable for them. It will add to the present woos of our economy. It will affect the Stock Exchange and the local credit market.
In the last budget of this government, they imposed taxes with retrospective effect such as Super Gain Tax. This time, the government has taken over Avant-Garde, a profitable venture. Next, they suspended the Port City Project. Doctors went on strike. So did bank employees. Even scrap iron traders protested.
Against this backdrop, the President repeatedly says that the government will not collapse. He says he will not allow anyone to topple it. Such repetitive remarks are made because the government?s stability is actually at stake. In this context, nobody is prepared, even to do a feasibility study, let alone any investment.
The budget deficit is estimated to be eight percent. The interest rate will also surge, and inflation will be over 7 percent. The growth rate will be slowed to 5.9 percent.* How will ordinary people feel the effects?
Ordinary people will be in a dire predicament under the spiraling cost of living. Theoretically, it is bound to increase. There will be price hikes of imported food items such as sugar, dhal and tinned fish, and intermediary goods such as chemical fertiliser, and capital goods like building materials. It is triggered by the rupee depreciation.
Compared with 2014, people have been taxed more. It means the rate of indirect tax has increased by 58 percent. After January, people will experience the impact of these taxes by way of price hikes of items they purchase for consumption in the market.
Secondly, investments have been ground to a standstill denying employment to many thousands of individuals, let alone the creation of one million employment opportunities-the much hyped slogan of the government. Likewise, self employment activities have suffered a severe blow. For them, the cost of imported raw materials has increased resulting in the rise of their cost of production. So, they cannot sustain their industries.
In addition to mega projects, small and medium scale projects have also been affected at village level. In the construction industry, the government is in arrears of payment worth Rs.500 million to contractors for work already completed. As long as it is in arrears, construction projects cannot be pursued. It will deny jobs for many persons working as masons and carpenters.* Some say there was no enlightened debate on the policy matters outlined in the budget. It is said speakers were more concerned on concession reduction and all. What is your view?
This is the least enlightened budget debate I have ever witnessed in my life. The reason is the main Opposition in Parliament, the Tamil National Alliance (TNA), is supportive of the budget. The Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) was also supportive of the government in an indirect manner.
The time meant for the Opposition was mostly allotted to these two parties during the debate. When analysing JVP speakers during the debate, it is crystal clear that they were more concerned about attacking the previous rule rather than focusing on the present budget. They also concentrated more on mudslinging at those who served in the Cabinet of the last government for personal reasons.
There was lack of debate on the actual contents of the budget. We, in the joint opposition, actually received less time to articulate our positions. We educated people outside Parliament as a result. The educated segments of society listened to us and understood what we said.
As a result, doctors went on strike, for example. In Sri Lankan Parliament, there is a dearth of MPs with a sound economic knowledge. It is a tragedy because Parliament, as the supreme authority overseeing public finance, needs such legislators more and more.
The media is also not giving adequate coverage to economic affairs taken up in the House. Instead, they tend to highlight frivolous talks uttered to and fro.* In the budget, the government has tried to seek a departure from the economic model hitherto adopted in the country, and to liberalise economy more. What is your opinion on this?
All of a sudden, the economic model cannot be changed radically. If the government intended to do it, it should have sought a mandate from people at the election. It did not do so. It, instead, promised the sun and the moon to people. It said nothing was impossible if corruption and malpractices were rooted out. Ahead of the election, it pledged to add the allowance of Rs.10, 000 to the basic salaries of public servants.
It vowed to give free motorcycles instead of giving them at a concessionary price. It said fertiliser subsidy would never be curtailed. It promised everything on earth to people and asked them to vote against the Rajapaksa government. Finally, what happened?
It is characteristic of the United National Party (UNP) to have such weaknesses. Yet, it pledged to be more welfare oriented than the Rajapaksa government in the run up to the election.* How practical is such an economic model to Sri Lanka?
For a country like Sri Lanka, the extreme end of any model is unacceptable. Education and healthcare are free in Sri Lanka, a phenomenon to different to most other countries in the world. Of course, it is a huge burden to the government. But, the successive governments did not do away free healthcare and education facilities since Independence.
No government can deviate from it now at once. Today, we see a quantitative development in education. We need to improve it quality-wise now. Today, students pass exams but fail in life.
Radical changes are needed in the education sector for skills development. Schools should not close at 1.30 p.m. They should function till 3.00 p.m. like in Japan, China and Korea. We should do away with exam oriented system.
Privatisation of education will not help. Today, even businessmen are harassed. (KB)

Reinforcing its commitment to environmental sustainability and technological innovation, Hatton National Bank (HNB) has concluded a highly successful awareness campaign which encouraged its customers to switch from paper statement accounts to e-statement accounts.
Titled ?Change Your Address and Win?, this campaign was a milestone in HNB?s long running environmental sustainability drive and its positioning as the ?Bank of the Future?.?
As paper product manufacturing contributes significantly to deforestation and produces greenhouse gases, there are numerous benefits to the environment from the use of e-statements.
From a customer point of view, this campaign was an example of HNB?s endeavour to boost the adoption of the latest technology among its customers in order to offer them superior service standards.
The three-month long campaign culminated in a draw which rewarded customers who had supported this initiative by opting for e-statements.?
The first prize, a Curved LED TV, went to Shakira Mubeena Begum Mohamed of HNB Emirates Customer Centre and the second prize of a family tour to Singapore was won by Mohomed Lafeer Fathima Sasmiya of HNB Islamic Banking Unit.?
The third prize of 3 Apple iPhone 6 phones were given to Anandarajah Ravindrarajah of HNB Trincomalee, Dandaniyage Dhammika of HNB Ginigathhena and R A Manjula Lakmini Perera of HNB Mount Lavinia.?
Commenting on this, Janaka Epasinghe, Head of Process Improvement and Change Management of HNB stated: ?As Sri Lanka makes rapid strides in the digital space, we at HNB are committed to being a key participant on this journey. Conversion of paper statements to e statements is an initiative which is merely one step in the right direction which will result in speedier and more convenient access to information for customers and would have a positive impact on the country?s eco system.?
HNB e-statements are now available for both individual and corporate accounts, including savings accounts, credit cards, current accounts and NRFC and RFC accounts.?
Once an account has been converted, the customer will receive the month?s e-statement on the first day of the following month via email, instead of the traditional mail-based paper statement.?
Furthermore, customers benefit from a lack of postal delay, ease of use, the added security offered by an email or computer password and the elimination of the need to regularly update a savings account passbook.?
They also have the freedom to choose which of their accounts to convert to e-statements, with the option of reverting to paper statements at any tme.

Indian fishermen to boycott Katchatheevu pilgrimage
	
Tamil Nadu fishermen have decided to boycott Katchatheevu pilgrimage for the annual festival at St Antony?s Church and not lend their boats, the Hindu reported today.
The pilgrimage is scheduled for February 20 and 21.
Leaders of 11 fishermen associations met in Tamil Nadu on Saturday and decided to boycott the festival in protest against the arrest of fishermen by the Lankan Navy and confiscation of their boats, P. Sesu Raja, leader of an association, said.
The associations felt that there was no point in attending the festival, organised by the Jaffna Diocese when fishermen were not allowed to fish around the islet as per the agreement after India ceded the islet to Sri Lanka, he said.
The Sri Lankan authorities repeatedly warned fishermen against crossing the International Maritime Boundary Line and threatened to ?nationalise? their confiscated boats but the Indian government remained silent, the leaders lamented.
They have conveyed their decision to L. Sahayaraj, Verkodu Parish Priest, who is the chief coordinator of the pilgrimage.

Ministry will not intervene in admitting students: Akila
	
Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam today requested all government school Principals not to send parents to him or to his secretary with requests for letters to admit their children to school.
He said this at a ceremony held at the Education Ministry, where each of the 140 schools, which had now started teaching Advanced Level Science Subjects was granted Rs.2 million. The funds will be utilized to build new laboratories and other equipment.
?The Education Ministry will not intervene in admitting students to grade one or grade five classes. Several Principals have sent parents to me asking for letters of recommendation. Please stop doing it because there is no way that I or the ministry will intervene in these matters,? the minister said.
The Principals were instructed by the Minister to follow the ministry?s circulars in every important decision they make with regard to the schools.
?The ministry allocates adequate funds for schools and therefore principals cannot collect money from the students for any purpose. They may collect a small amount for welfare but other than that they cannot collect money from students. During the last decade we noticed that nobody actually follow the circulars issued by the ministry. We will put all the circulars in place and take actions against those who violate any terms in those circulars,? Minister Kariyawasam said. (Piyumi Fonseka)

Minister of Development Strategies and International Trade Malik Samarawickrama yesterday refuted the charges made by the Opposition that a framework agreement on the proposed India and Lanka Technological and Economic Participation Agreement is to be signed in February this year.
The charges were made by the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) and the Jathika Nidahas Peramuna (JNP) led by former Minister Wimal Weerawansa who said the proposed Indo Lanka agreement is to be signed shortly.
Minister Samarawickrama told Daily Mirror that the government had not discussed anything about signing an agreement by February.
?We have not discussed a framework agreement yet,? he said but indicated that s framework signing is on the cards as he said the process would be an initial framework agreement and then the final agreement which will come in five to six months time at least.
?We have not even discussed a framework agreement yet. After the framework agreement is signed, it will take five to six months to conclude the final agreement,? he said while assuring that any agreement would be signed only after consulting all stakeholders including the trade chambers, unions, professionals and the Opposition political parties.
The Minister said Only Maritime Services ( ship building) and IT related services will be included in the agreement.

One of the six doctors suspected of being involved in the kidney transplant scandal is a member of the GMOA, Assistant Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said yesterday.
?This particular doctor, who is practicing in a Colombo hospital, is alleged to have been involved in the international kidney-selling scam. But, the allegations have not been proved nor have they been made by official or reliable sources,? he said.
Dr. Aluthge said that in the wake of social media reports, the GMOA had checked with the Health Ministry whether the name of this doctor was in the suspected doctors' list and on receipt of ministry confirmation, the GMOA had found that he was one of its members.
?He is one of the 20,000 members countrywide and does not hold any positions in the organisation, neither is he a GMOA Central Committee member nor a member in any of the Branch Unions. We have decided to take disciplinary action against him if he is found guilty of the kidney racket,? Dr. Aluthge said.
?At the previous news conference a journalist asked whether it was this particular doctor who is alleged to be involved in this racket. We were unable to confirm the name or give any details because nothing has been proved yet and the allegations have only been made via social media websites,? he said

Probe on some incidents must to clear name of security forces: President
	
A probe on a few incidents has become essential in order to prevent the world from naming the Sri Lankan security forces as an unlawful force, President Maithripala Sirisena said today.
?Such a probe on a few incidents is essential to save our security forces from being outlawed by the world,? President Sirisena said during the launch of the 'Virusara? privilege card for security forces at Temple Trees this afternoon.
However, President Sirisena said no probe would target the security forces as the only objective would be to know the truth.
He questioned whether those who opposed a probe and accused the government of betraying the nation were waiting till Sri Lanka was isolated by the world. He said this while highlighting that Sri Lanka was bound by the international covenants? to safeguard the rights of people and treat them equally.
Stating that some had started to talk about blood, the President said those who did that should realize that human blood is same irrespective of what ethnic or religious group a person belonged to and irrespective of the language they spoke.
The President said a mudslinging campaign was being carried out by some in the social media and some have even suggested that he and the Prime Minister should be broken into pieces. However he said they could not be silenced by these campaigns. ?We will do our duty amidst mudslinging and death threats,? he said.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremeisnghe who was expected to participate in the ceremony was a notable absentee.
Meanwhile, State Minister of Defence Ruwan Wijewardene addressing the ceremony said the government would bestow the topmost status to the security forces, the police and members of Civil Defence Forces.
He said the allegation made by some that the government was neglecting the country?s security and the sovereignty was totally baseless and false claim. ?We will not do anything to jeopardize the security and sovereignty of our motherland,? he said.
Mr. Wijewardene said the decision of the government to introduce a privilege card scheme for the security forces, police and the members of the Civil Defense forces was to enhance their status.
?We will never forget the security forces personnel who sacrificed their lives for the country, those who became physically challenged and their families. That?s why we have introduced this system,? he added. (Yohan Perera)

SL should fulfill rights council call for justice- HRW
	
The Sri Lankan government should fulfill its commitments to the United Nations Human Rights Council by ensuring that foreign judges and prosecutors play a significant role in the mandated accountability mechanism for wartime abuses, Human Rights Watch said today. On January 21, 2016, President Maithripala Sirisena told the BBC, contrary to Sri Lanka?s council commitments, that he will ?never agree to international involvement,? saying ?[w]e have more than enough specialists, experts and knowledgeable people in our country to solve our internal issues."

After adoption of the resolution, Sri Lanka told the council that it was pleased to join as a co-sponsor ?as a further manifestation of Sri Lanka?s commitment to implement the provisions of the resolution, in a manner that its objectives are shared by the people and all stakeholders in the country, for their benefit.?
?The Sri Lankan government sought international involvement to ensure justice and accountability so there?s no excuse for backtracking now,? said Brad Adams, Asia director. ?President Sirisena needs to understand that international participation in a war crimes tribunal was not a vague promise to the UN but a firm commitment to the thousands of Sri Lankans who suffered during the country?s long civil war.?
President Sirisena?s statement comes just weeks before a scheduled visit to the country by the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Zeid Ra?ad Al Hussein. The high commissioner?s office released a report detailing wartime abuses by both sides, calling for a ?hybrid? justice mechanism given the shortcomings of domestic institutions to ensure impartial investigations and witness protection, and the Sri Lankan government?s failure to take meaningful accountability measures since the war ended in May 2009. The 2015 Human Rights Council resolution affirms the importance of participation in a justice mechanism of ?Commonwealth and other foreign judges ? and authorized prosecutors and investigators.?
In line with its commitments, the government should be implementing its plans for a war crimes tribunal with international participation, a Commission for Truth, Justice, Reconciliation, and Non-recurrence, and an Office on Missing Persons. Progress on those commitments has been slow and not wholly transparent. A task force on consultations on the Human Rights Council resolution has been established, but there is little public information about its mandate and terms of reference. Victims and their representative groups have not been informed about the consultation, leaving many feeling isolated and shut out from a process ostensibly intended to provide real justice to them. The recent statements by the president and prime minister, who said that all missing persons are presumed dead, raise concerns that consultations will merely be window dressing for a predetermined outcome.
?The countries that worked so closely with Sri Lanka at the Human Rights Council last year have a responsibility to ensure that this important resolution will be properly adopted,? Adams said. ?The real rights gains made by the Sirisena administration will rapidly fade if the families of wartime victims feel that their one hope for justice was dropped on the basis of political calculations.?
