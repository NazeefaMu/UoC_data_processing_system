Are there alternative treatments for Osteoarthritis
	

Q A doctor informed me of an alternative treatment for the ailment, Osteoarthritis recently. It is known as Surve Cell. According to this method the doctor draws some blood from the patients knees, culture them and after a few days re-inject the same blood back to the knees. According to the information from my general physician, there had been favourable results from this procedure.
What is your opinion about this method If I try this, will there be any relief for me
Michael Pieris - A suffering patient
A: There are two types of blood product related injections that are being practiced in the world for knee and muscle related problems.
Out of this I assume that you were referring to platelet rich plasma injections. This is what is practiced in Sri Lanka. There is another variety of injections which uses stem cells. This is currently not available in Sri Lanka as it is a very advanced type of an injection with colossal expenses for the patient.
Platelet rich plasma injections are done using the patients own blood. Blood is drawn out from the patient and particles called platelets are separated from other components. Then these platelets are injected in to the joints or painful muscles. The usefulness of these injections were analysed by a premier research group called Cochrane. What they did was, they checked the response of nearly 1088 patients who were given these injections. What they found out was that there was not much of a difference in pain symptoms even after the injections were given. Therefore still platelet rich plasma is not an approved way of curing joint pain. At National Health Services-United Kingdom where I worked a couple of years ago, these injections were never practiced by rheumatologists/joint specialists.
I hope this information was useful for you.

A Blue party purohita from Wayamba who has also made his mark in the countrys entertainment field is holding a grudge against the Blue party seniors for their alleged underhand moves to undermine the yahapalanaya government. 

This purohita who had once thrown in his lot with the Green party too has confided in some of his colleagues that he was planning to launch his own political party.
Accounting for his intention to found a new party of his own, the purohita has also told his friendly colleagues that he had to face very unpleasant situations both as a Green and a Blue due to intra-party rivalry over manape.

Northern Province Chief Minister C. V. Wigneswaran had appealed to the people to treat today (18) as A Day of Mourning and observe three minutes silence in memory of those who lost their lives during the final stages of the war.
The commemoration week of the Northern Provincial Council (NPC) would conclude with a programme on the Vellamulliwaikkal beach in Mullaitivu.
The Chief Minister had also asked Tamils living in other parts of the world to engage in commemoration activities to coincide with the remembrance programme in Mulliwaikkal.
He had requested Tamils overseas to show their support for the programme in their own countries by observing three minutes silence at 9.30 am in honour of those that lost their lives on this day so many years ago and to call upon the government of Sri Lanka to expedite investigations into war-crimes allegations.
The notice further say that although Tamils are now living peacefully in the north, they still have bitter memories of the war and that the relations of those who died needed closure on what actually happened and justice should prevail.
Tomorrow's commemorative event was scheduled to take place at the War Memorial on the beach in Vellamulliwaikkal in Mullaitivu under the patronage of Chief Minister C. V. Wigneswaran. Several programmes have also been arranged by various politicians and organisations to mark the occasion. (Romesh Madushanka)

Ceylinco Life breaks new ground with Sri Lankas first retirement resort
	

Can life truly begin at 60 Sri Lankas life insurance leader Ceylinco Life believes the answer is yes, for active retirees, and has created the countrys first retirement resort for this segment.
Built along the lines of a medium-sized resort hotel, La Serena comprises of 44 self-contained, fully-furnished, equipped and serviced living units, which will be offered on short or long-term rent to active retirees seeking to live independently without the hassles of maintaining and running their own homes.
Occupying almost three acres of scenic beachfront land at Uswetakeiyawa, just 14 km north of Colombo, the resort comprises of 28 single bedroom units and 16 two-bedroom units, built around common facilities including a swimming pool, mini gym, restaurant, library and reading room, entertainment lounge and beach terrace.
Each living unit has its own living room, dining area, kitchenette and in-suite bathrooms, one for every bedroom, cleverly designed and furnished for optimal use of space  535 square feet per single bedroom unit and 680 square feet per two bedroom unit.
This is a ground-breaking concept for Sri Lanka but one that has been quite successful in other parts of the world, Ceylinco Life Managing Director/CEO R. Renganathan told journalists hosted to a tour of the facility just days after it opened for public viewing.
As a wholly-owned subsidiary of Ceylinco Life, the managing company Serene Resorts Limited has the benefit of the strength and expertise of the countrys biggest and most successful life insurance company, and is intended to be the forerunner of further investments in retirement living,
Renganathan disclosed.
Every residential unit is fully furnished with living room, dining room and bedroom furniture, LED TV, refrigerator, induction cooker, microwave oven, electric kettle, telephone, ceiling fans and safe deposit box. All units have air-conditioning.
Available at a daily rental for short stays of two weeks to one month or at a monthly rental for stays of a year or more, each fully-furnished residential unit is supplied electricity and water under a utility fee and has its own telephone, cable TV, Internet and Wi-Fi, laundry services, newspapers and parking and a daily janitorial service. Breakfast, lunch and dinner are available at the restaurant for those who do not wish to prepare their own and a-la-carte orders may be placed via Room Service.
The facility will have a doctor on call, 24-hour security and CCTV cameras, outsourced taxi services and access to a salon and spa nearby.
A guest house within the complex with four rooms available on a daily rental is set aside for family members visiting La Serenas residents from overseas or distant areas, facilitating interaction.
We see this retirement resort catering to the needs of several customer segments, Renganathan said.
They could be newly retired or semi-retired men and women with a source of income such as investments, consultancies or freelance work, who like their independence, are reasonably active and would like a hotel-like ambience because they do not want to be burdened with managing and maintaining their own homes and the attendant dealing with domestics, preparing meals and so on.
La Serena could also be a solution for children seeking a secure, managed environment for parents, without the stigma associated with elders homes. Older people visiting family or friends in Sri Lanka will also find our short-term rentals a great alternative to staying in a hotel.

Dengue outbreak: Transfer of medical specialists not justifiable: Vitharana
	
The transfer of medical specialists including the Epidemiology Unit Chief under the five-year transfer scheme was unjustifiable in the wake of the dengue outbreak, former MP Tissa Vitharana said today.
He told a news conference that Health Ministrys Dengue Eradication Units Coordinator Dr. Hasitha Tissera and Epidemiology Units Director and Chief Epidemiologist Dr. Paba Palihawadana have been transferred to administrative units of other hospitals.
Both of them have performed creditably in the eradication of dengue for many years and they have a wide experience in this field. However, they have been transferred despite the spreading of dengue countrywide, Prof. Vitharana said.
He said it was not reasonable to carry out such transfers even though the five-year transferring scheme was applicable in State institutions. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)

Economic pills too bitter to swallow
	

The purohita in charge of the public purse and the head of the bank controlling the countrys monetary policy  had reportedly been involved in a heated exchange at the meeting of a high-level committee on economic management the other day.

The purohita had reportedly taken exception to some comments contained in the latest annual report of the bank and a heated argument had ensued when the bank head defended the contents of the report. By the way, according to informed sources these two often find themselves at loggerheads on matters of economic policy and fundamentals.
The purohita in a highly emotive outburst had even accused the bank head of playing a double game, they say.
The bank head, however, had in a deft stroke sent the ball flying back to his antagonists court and this had triggered another tirade by the purohita. 
However, the other participants had at this stage intervened to put an end to the verbal battle.

The duo have now become openly hostile to each other. Meanwhile, neither is prepared to budge an inch from their respective stances as both enjoy a strong backing from a section of the government, they say.

Five reasons why mobile devices are changing societies
	
Wireless technology has made life so much easier today. However with the emergence of smartphones and other mobile devices, users rely heavily on them. Although this has its own pros and cons, mobile devices have made working more convenient for students and other professionals. Today, there is a growing trend of the usage of mobile devices. Following are a few reasons why you these mobile devices are changing societies:

ONLINE SHOPPING
Now buyers dont have to always visit the nearest supermarket to buy any items. Mobile devices are commonly used for purchasing purposes. With an online account you can purchase almost anything that is available on a site. If you crave for the latest headphones, bags, accessories or any other item you can do that with a few clicks. This makes it easier for you to make the purchase which in turn saves time. With online purchasing one doesnt have to wait in long queues as well and it is also easy to search for merchandise that you want to buy.
AVAILABILITY
Users are available 24/7 and this allows people to reach anybody via their devices. Sure, the devices have mute functions and off buttons, but the constant flow of input can make many people reluctant to use these options (or to rely on them for long), especially if our mobile devices are used for work or emergency contact from loved ones.

USERS ARE NEVER BORED
Mobile devices can hold or connect to an endless amount of entertainment. Thanks to streaming audio, video, copious storage capacities and zippy processors, its possible to listen to music, watch movies, read e-books, browse the web, engage with others and play games in just a few taps. No disconnections from loved ones Social media can help strengthen relationships. It can build new relationships and ensure that people do stay connected for longer periods of time. Today thanks to social media, people from all over the world can stay connected.
CONVENIENCE
Using mobile devices have made life so much easier for the users. One reason is that people do not have to go to their workplace or home to reply to an email or a message. They can reply instantly and ensure that the senders do not have to wait for their replies.

He is concerned about the dwindling elephant population
	

This story is about elephants. We are only to retell it for it was originally told at a grand wedding held at a high-end hotel at Diyawanna. A provincial chief purohita played the host at this wedding.

Political heavyweights and lightweights practically from all main political parties and even Number One were present as wedding guests at the time this story was being told, they say.
Political elephants figured at the outset and the focus of the story soon turned to elephants in the wild. The former monarch found himself at the centre-stage when he declared that the elephant population in the wild was fast dwindling with the population figure coming down to something less than 4,000.
Now that he held everyones attention, the former monarch proceeded to account for this phenomenon. Although male elephants in musth do not look for particular terrain in the wild for courtship with females, they prefer mating in water But now there are no tanks and waterways suited for their reproductive activity. The physical incompatibility  the matching height and size - between male and female elephants also often become an impediment to copulation. Those responsible for preservation of our wildlife should look into this kind of obstacles in the way of the reproduction process of our wild elephants. They do not seem to have realized that our elephants are now endangered. I see only utter madness in their activity!  They all listened to the former monarch with much interest and most of them nodded their approval with a smile when he wound up.

How safe is your child 47 complaints of kidnapping over the past five months
	
The internet is increasingly being used as a gateway for offenders to commit crimes. Social media has become a contributory tool for a number of child abuses and abductions. While there are unavoidable occasions where children have to face the world alone, parents and caregivers are advised to train their children to be aware of some disturbed individuals who are capable of harming children. These individuals could be capable of physical, mental abuses or acts such as kidnapping for ransom or for human trafficking. Within such a context, self-defence has become a highly valued ability where children are concerned. With children becoming more and more independent at a very young age, incidents of child abductions are reported daily. The trend shows the lack of communication between parents and children when faced with abusive threats. Most child abductions have been reported where the perso n involved is known to the children and many abducted victims have shown a lack of self-defence. 
Recently we came across a rather rare type of a kidnapping in Sri Lanka. A two and a half-year-old child in Gampola was kidnapped upon a plan masterminded by his own uncle on May 3, with the hope of obtaining Rs.500,000 to buy a brand new motorcycle from the would-be ransom. It was later raised to Rs.3 million with the demand of supporters involved in the crime. The abducted child was found in Karadiyanaru, the suspects were found with the ransom money and the most of involved suspects are in police custody.
It was revealed during investigations that the so-called uncle had accompanied the child on the pretence of delivering lunch to the childs father and acted as if he too was kidnapped. Even though the child had been away from his parents and family for three days, he was not harmed. 
Civil aspects of international child abduction or child theft is the unauthorized removal of a minor (a child under the age of legal adulthood) from the custody of the childs natural parents or legally appointed guardians.
Children should be well trained in self-defence
MARINI DE LIVERA Chairperson National Child Protection Authority (NCPA)
Marini de Livera attributes to legal delays, a lack of deterrents, taking a long time to complete a criminal case and delays in punishing perpetrators, as reasons for a rise in child abductions over the past years. 
When queried on the measures taken by the NCPA in relation to the prevention of child abduction, de Livera mentioned that they have worked towards creating awareness among children who are potential victims of abduction, stating that it was necessary for their eyes to be opened regarding this matter as children who will have to defend themselves when facing such a circumstance. 
People always point fingers at parents and schools saying that they are responsible for the protection of children. This may be true to some extent but it is also the responsibility of the child to be aware of such situations and act accordingly to prevent kidnappings and getting themselves out of such predicaments and escaping to safety. In order that the child could do so, awareness and caution regarding such situations have to be raised and they have to be educated and trained on procedures to be followed if such an occasion arose. With this intention, we at NCPA conduct awareness programs in schools and villages at district levels. 
She also went on to say that a child from a young but comprehensible age should be trained in such a way that he or she may possess the skills of identifying the tell tale signs of an unsafe environment, to avoid gifts from strangers and only to confide in people who are trust bound which for them would basically be their parents. We live in a strange time where one cannot even trust his/her own relations now since most of the abductions that have occurred within the country have had the hands of a close relative behind them. 
When the question of future steps and precautions that would be taken on behalf of the NCPA with the intention of avoiding future child abductions was posed on de Livera, she stated that conducting child outreach programs at different districts would be of the utmost importance in achieving this goal. She added that we as citizens of Sri Lanka, together form a community and as a community, we uphold ethics and values which include duties towards every single child in Sri Lanka. 
Every single person, be it a police officer, a lawyer or a doctor or any other professional, we all have to come together as a community and have a duty alike towards children regardless of the fact whether they are ones own offspring or not. Today we live in a selfish community where people try to wash their hands off of one another. We should change ourselves. If I were also to point fingers to others and say that if a child abducted was not mine and therefore not my problem, I wouldnt be here today. But I acted differently and ask everyone else to think wide. Think of every child as your own. We belong to the community. Every single child of this country belongs to the community and we have a duty towards every child, not just our own. 
Call for help
The NCPA child helpline 1929 is a 24-hour toll free hotline open to children and parents to lodge complains when they feel that child rights are violated or threatened. In the case of child abduction, the public are advised to inform the NCPA by dialling 1929 which the NCPA notes will be strengthened further in days to come. 
Once a kidnapping is notified to the NCPA, a series of steps are to be followed. The NCPA takes action by assigning their own police forces in the area and the other authorities to conduct investigations pertaining to the case. We maintain coordination with the Police Department, media and relevant ministries. The NCPA monitors keep close tabs along the pipeline of investigation. If such a report is obstructed by administration, we prompt the pursuit of investigation. 
Word of advice to parents
To prevent child abductions, she stressed that the key factor is to strengthen the communication channel between parents/guardian and children. She went on to say that in such a busy world today, in most families, both parents are employed and they do not get much time to spend with their children at home. In these circumstances, the time that parents and children get to spend as a family is weakened and children lose the opportunity to communicate with their parents and to confide in them if they are facing any problems. Parents/guardian will have no idea of what is going on in their childrens lives and therefore would not be able to support and protect them in any way. And by the time some misfortune takes place to the children, it would all be too little, too late.

Parents/guardians have to be cautious as to whether their children are vulnerable. Contacts between the child and parent/guardian have to be frequently established. Children have to be made aware of their inner circle which parents are a part of to whom they should be able to confide in everything. They have to be made cautious of the dangers of strangers and should be educated in being able to tell if someone displays strange behaviour and how to act in such situations. The basic knowledge on how to deal with strangers has to come from the parents. The child should also be encouraged to speak up and disclose everything to their parents so that parents are aware of what is going on with the child on a daily basis. Therefore, we stress communication is the key. 
Kidnapping
Kidnapping is a serious crime and the parents/guardians of the victims are advised to act tactfully, especially in the involvement of ransom. The police have to be notified. As kidnapping is no childs play, it is also advised to contact the NCPA using the toll free helpline available to the public for securing more reinforcements in the intention of increasing the probability of ones chances in finding the child victim safe and sound. It is quite easy to understand the emotional turmoil that a parent/guardian goes through when their child has been kidnapped. But it is always advised to keep calm and act with a cool mind no matter how panic-stricken a parent may feel. The NCPA Chairperson also advises parents on the steps that they have to follow under the circumstance that their child is kidnapped. 47 complaints of kidnapping have been made in 2017. 
My advice is to inform and follow up on the investigations and constantly keep in contact with the relevant authorities such as the police, lawyers, and officers from NCPA. 
NCPA is the foremost authority in Sri Lanka that acts for the regulation and coordination of actions against all forms of child abuses by formulating necessary policies for protection of children in the country with the intentions of child protection, prevention of child abuses, and rehabilitation of victimized children and reintegrating them to the society.
Most of the abducted children belong to the middle class
PROF. MAYURA SAMARAKOON Head of Department of Sociology and Anthropology, University of Sri Jayawardenapura
Child abductions have increased rapidly in recent times. Elevated sexual interest in the society, using internet and preferring to watch sexual content often are leading causes responsible for this calamity. Prof. Samarakoon described. 
The young generation has a tendency to remain single until their 30s. It is evident from research, that males marry around the age of 33 while females do around 32. The average Sri Lankan youth gets married in their 30s. Postponing marriages are results of increased interest in education and employment afterwards. The duration between completing education and being stable in an employment is lengthy. Postponing marriages wont go hand in hand with sexual desires, as the latter are fulfilled without delaying. 
The general health among older people is getting better day by day, in comparison with the past. The older males are getting stronger and healthier. Sexual needs of older males are neglected by their female partners, led by culture and certain norms such as not indulging in sex when the children are grown up. Most of the time, older parents sleep in different compartments or one parent is far away from the other. Therefore, avoiding sex in old age could also be seen as a leading contributory factor for increasing child abductions. Children are abducted mostly by their grandfathers, he said emphasizing a bitter truth. 
Parents losing interest in their children is yet another cause for increased child abductions. Parents in modern society are highly attached to their profession and they assume earning more money would benefit their children. It is not the amount of money that matters or children appreciate, but the time their parents spend with them really matters. Lack of attention, loss of love and consideration from the parents tempt children to get close to an elder readily giving attention and love, the professor explained. 
Child-centred reality TV shows are attracting parents, who try to send their children to any TV show regardless of the impacts or unnecessary sexual attraction on the children. And of course they are acting like mini versions of adults exhibiting provocative behaviour instead of being their true child selves. he noted. 

Commenting on an identified level of society where the child abuse has increased, Prof. Samarakoon said; Most abducted children belong to the middle-class and their parents are employed. Except the middle-class, the farming villages in dry zone such as Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa record a high level of child abuse. Underage marriages are common; which is likely amounts to child abuse. Extreme poverty forces underage marriages. People in this society are inconsiderate of their childrens safety and protection and children are under the guardianship of a neighbouring family or relatives. 
Daycare centres have become the ultimate solution for employed parents/guardians to keep their children safe while they are away at work. Daycare centres could be dangerously abusive in the future, if the responsible people do not pay considerable attention on activities that happen there. Yet, evidently children are mentally and physically abused in daycare centres for the convenience of employers. Some daycare centres schedule one hour for sleeping after lunch in their timetable which is completely an abuse. It is inessential for children below the age of five to sleep after the lunch as they are very active and they are in a critical period of mental and physical development. This activity would affect badly on their future. Therefore, the responsible officials should be well aware of what happens in daycares, especially the NCPA. And theres no background or qualifications are required to open a daycare centre, as anyone interested can. Prof. Samarakoon said. 
Describing the behaviour of an abducted child he noted: Children will reveal the abuses only to a very close person in their lives. Usually they are threatened or cheated by the abuser for not revealing anything. The mental damage happened to them wont be revealed unless they are diagnosed for a mental illness later at some point in their lives. 
Saman Kumaras Death
Saman Kumara case is recorded as the first ever child kidnapping - turned murder case in Sri Lankan history. He was kidnapped, murdered when the perpetrators demanded for ransom while he was dead and buried. 
Saman Kumara (14) was the youngest son of a wealthy merchant in Mathugama. On April 5, 1983, he left home early in the morning for school. He met Dharmasiri, a family friend, on the way and he was taken apparently to the school. Saman would have never thought that Dharmasiri would take him to Bopitiya mountain and kill him. After the murder of the student, an unknown letter reached his father demanding Rs. 1.5 million and threatening to harm the child if the family dared inform the police. The whole village was looking for the lost student and murderer Dharmasiri also took part in the search. People had noticed an unusual behaviour in Dharmasiri who was subsequently arrested and questioned to reveal the killing of Saman Kumara who was murdered and buried in a slope of a mountain. B.A. Dharmasiri and his partner of crimes, Pitigalage Premarathna were jailed for many years. 

First child abduction in Sri Lanka
On February 12, 1958, three-year-old Jagath Kumara was kidnapped from his home in Munagama in Horana and the kidnapper demanded Rs.12,000 as ransom. Two days later, the police found the child left in a dispensary yard in Grandpass. The child appeared to be unharmed nor abducted as he had said that he visited his aunts home. Later on, the victims wife had commented on his experience to a weekly Sunday newspaper, saying that, even though they had pointed a gun three times threatening to kill him, he had asked for the gun thinking it was a toy.

THE HAGUE (REUTERS) May 15, 2017 - India asked World Court judges on Monday to order Pakistan to stay the execution of an Indian citizen who Islamabad says is a captured spy, a case that has escalated tensions between the two nuclear-armed neighbours. 
India argued in a preliminary hearing at the U.N. court, formally known as the International Court of Justice (ICJ), that Pakistan violated the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations by denying the condemned man access to legal and other assistance from India. 
Pakistan responded that the court should decline jurisdiction in the case.

Irans re-engagement with the world at stake in Friday presidential vote
	
REUTERS, 16th MAY, 2017- Iranians vote for president on Friday in a contest likely to determine whether Tehrans re-engagement with the world stalls or quickens, although whatever the outcome no change is expected to its revolutionary system of conservative clerical rule.
Seeking a second term, pragmatist President Hassan Rouhani, 68, remains the narrow favourite, but hardline rivals have hammered him over his failure to boost an economy weakened by decades of sanctions.
Many Iranians feel a 2015 agreement he championed with major powers to lift sanctions in return for curbing Irans nuclear programme has failed to produce the jobs, growth and foreign investment he said would follow.
The normally mild-mannered cleric is trying to hold on to office by firing up reformist voters who want less confrontation abroad and more social and economic freedom at home.
In recent days he has adopted robust rhetoric, pushing at the boundaries of what is permitted in Iran. He has accused his conservative opponents of abusing human rights, misusing religious authority to gain power and representing the economic interests of the security forces.
Rouhanis strongest challenger is hardline cleric Ebrahim Raisi, 56, who says Iran does not need foreign help and promises a revival of the values of the 1979 Islamic Revolution.
He is backed by Irans elite Revolutionary Guards, the countrys top security force, their affiliated volunteer Basij militia, hardline clerics and two influential clerical groups.

The landmark memorandum of agreement (MoA) signed between two of the countrys leading accounting bodies, has now paved the way for CIMA members to obtain the membership of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka (CA Sri Lanka), the national body of accountants.
Accordingly, the CIMA members who complete the necessary modules and practical training requirements as stipulated by CA Sri Lanka can obtain the membership from CA Sri Lanka and enjoy enhanced standing as a distinguished accounting professional.
As per the agreement, the CIMA members with five years (or more) of post-membership experience must complete the KC1 Corporate Financial Reporting and KC4 Corporate Governance, Assurance and Ethics modules, along with the practical training requirements to obtain the CA Sri Lanka membership.
The CIMA members with less than five years of post-membership experience must complete the KC1 Corporate Financial Reporting, KC3 Corporate Taxation and KC4 Corporate Governance, Assurance and Ethics modules along with the relevant practical training requirements to obtain membership.
Apart from the reciprocal membership-related benefits offered to the members of both bodies, the MoA will also endorse and promote the Global Management Accounting Principles with CIMA and CA Sri Lanka working together to develop a national plan for the adoption of these principles. Both institutions will also mutually identify and support their respective technical agendas and projects.
CA Sri Lanka President Lasantha Wickremasinghe said that as one of the most influential professional bodies in the country, CA Sri Lanka understands the importance of continuously enhancing the standing of professionals in the country, to ensure they continue to be in demand in the corporate world.
We signed a memorandum of agreement with CIMA last year in our continuing efforts to enhance the standing of our members and we have also taken steps to ensure that even CIMA members can enjoy the same advantages that CA Sri Lanka members as we have updated the agreement and have offered reciprocal benefits to CIMA, he added.
CIMA President and Association of International Certified Professional Accountants Chair Andrew Miskin said, We are very pleased that the CIMA members are now able to obtain membership of CA Sri Lanka by completing selected modules of the CA qualification. This positive development indeed augurs well to spur the enhancement of the accounting profession in the country and provide professional talent for
business growth.
In fact, the adoption of the Global Management Accounting Principles, which have been standardised by the British Standards Institute as best in class, will further build the capability of business leaders to drive long-term performance and bottom
line results.

LED bulbs for 3.8mn consumers: Minister
	
The cabinet had approved to provide ten million LED bulbs to 3.8million consumers under low income category, Power and Energy Minister Ranjith Siyambalapitiya said.
Speaking to the media yesterday the Minister said those 3.8million people still use incandescent bulbs and it consumes 70 percent more electricity than LED bulbs.
The low income consumers cannot buy LED bulbs due to their high price. Therefore the ministry had taken this decision to provide relief to them. The LED bulbs will be provided following the requirement and the request of the consumers. The cost of the LED bulbs will be collected within 24 months from their electricity bill. 
The minister had assured not to increase the electricity bills though the cost of the LED bulbs were added to it. While using the LED bulbs for 24 months the consumer can pay the price of the bulbs from the saved electricity units, he said.
These bulbs would be obtained by calling an international tender and they would be issued with a five year warranty from the provider.
The consumer will get the benefit from the LED bulb for five years while resettling the cost of the bulbs within two years and will get money saved during the remaining three years with the guarantee provided by the provider, Minister Siyambalapitiya said.
The ministry is looking forward to do the coordination process through the meter readers.
According to the Ministry calculations, the cost of the LED bulbs could be recovered within four months.
It would be an opportunity to save the high electricity usage during 7.00p.m to 10.00p.m and the Ministry request consumers to replace any incandescent bulbs used by them with energy saving CFL and LED bulbs in order to save energy. (Chaturanga Pradeep)

Listen to your hair - it talks
	
A high chemical percentage in shampoos, conditioners, artificial foods, toxic lifestyle, stress and mental conditions are some of the most common causes related to thinning hair. Hair fall is a persistent problem for almost everyone today. Although it does not seem to be considered as a serious health issue, it is undoubtedly a problem most people seem to be grappling with. However if hair continues to fall in unusual volumes, it is certainly a red light demanding your attention. Abnormalities in hair growth as well as hair fall has also been linked with inner imbalances and some diseases. 
Do you know that hair has a life cycle
Yes, our hair has a life cycle! It passes three stages. Men and women both have this cycle with differences according to their gender, genetics and some other reasons.

Growing pace - Hair grows
	Resting pace - Hair stays on scalp 
	Falling pace - Hair starts to fall out

Margin for normal and abnormal hair fall
Dr. Indira Kahawita, Consultant Dermatologist at the Base Hospital of Homagama believes that people easily misunderstand the hair fall levels. Their misunderstandings often cause them to demand for medications to treat their imagined hair loss. She emphasizes it is normal to lose some strands every day. Losing 20 or 50 hair strands a day is absolutely normal and if someone loses more than 100 strands within a day, that is considered as an abnormal hair loss, she said. She further noted that advertising concepts introduced by various hair care products have been successful in presenting this illusion. These advertisements often create the impression that hair fall is a serious issue and their products can help stop such hair fall. The Dermatologist also mentioned that no shampoo is able to stop hair fall as it is a natural biological cycle that the human body follows.
We also asked Dr. Kahawita on the most common reasons associated with hair fall.

Dandruff
Dandruff is such a common condition that almost everyone has faced at least once in their lifetime. Anti dandruff shampoos, over the counter aids are helpful for a casual condition. However if the dandruff is becoming an issue, interrupting your day to day activities such as a development of serious itching, followed by pimple like blisters on the forehead, shoulders or behind ears, it is essential to seek medical assistance. Medicinal shampoos to ease this struggle will be prescribed by a dermatologist.

Fever
Dengue is considered a severe illness spreading all over the country at present. Dengue and other life threatening fevers too are responsible for hair loss. When the body is struggling a serious ailment such as dengue fever, all the energy in the body are purposely directed to saving the persons life. This means that energy requirement for hair growth will take a back seat. Therefore, the blood supply to hair follicles is reduced and more hairs will start to rest (resting pace in hair life cycle). Losing 200 to 300 hair strands a day is normal during and after recovering from life threatening fevers. However after a duration of at least three months the resting phase of hair will conclude.

Severe mental stress
Death of a loved one, failing an exam or causes affect your mental peace can trigger severe stress, paving way for you to lose hair. Yet any of these abnormalities will be fixed naturally within 2 -3 months and hair will grow again following its natural paces.

Patchy hair/ Alopecia areata
Circular patches with less hair compared to other parts are called Alopacia areata and this can appear in the beard, eye brows or any area of the human body where hair grows. This disease is connected with autoimmunity. Most of the people try home remedies for this disease. It is important to note that home remedies can worsen the condition beyond help. Dr. Kahawita notes that those who suffer from this disease should never resort to home remedies.

Hair styling
Relaxing, perming and re  bonding, are only a few of the hair trends that are usually followed by males and females alike. It is not a secret that continous styling of hair would eventually weaken your hair making it brittle and dull. If anyone wants to style their hair, they have to follow hair treatments before and after styling or otherwise face the burden of damaged hair. 

Malnutrition
Nutrition plays a strong role in ones hair growth. Therefore its necessary to have a balanced diet including vegetables, green leaves and fruits. Excess consumption of carbohydrates wont give you the necessary nutrition.

Some other causes for hair loss are:
	Low hemoglobin levels in hair
	Heavy menstrual bleeding
	Thyroid (Over active or under active thyroid gland)
	Anemia 
	Certain drugs used in treatments (Cancer etc.)
	Thinning hair
Both sexes face this problem, but in different ways. As men fear a bald head, women losing hair on the top of their head. Such hair thinning is often the result of imbalances of male and female hormones. Women find these common, in reaching their menopause in their 40s.
Hormone related treatments are quite expensive and difficult to afford. Hair transplant is the most expensive treatment and injecting hormones called HRT (Hormone Replacement Therapy) will lead to undesired side effects. We discovered that the medical brands available in Sri Lanka for such treatments are of exorbitant amounts.
Dr. Kahawita observed that many children nowadays have thin hair in their frontal hairline. Keeping hair tight as buns, ponytails or other tight forms for too long can push their frontal hairline back.

Adore your hair
Applying an oil is essential to keep dry hair moist and healthy. Coconut oil is an excellent oil which is easily available. Any oil used for hair treatment can be used based on individual preferences. Keep your hair relaxed for a certain period every-day, it needs the rest. Keep your hair protected from sunshine when outside.

MR is not responsible for current economic turmoil: Bandula
	
The latest Central Bank (CB) report for the year 2016 clearly indicates that current economic crisis was not a result of the action of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa or his government, the Joint opposition claimed yesterday.
Addressing a press briefing, MP Bandula Gunawardane said nearly two and half years has passed since the Unity government came in to power and still they are struggling to resolve the economic issues.
MP Gunawardane said by importing crude oil present government had to spend US Dollar 2.7 billions and 2.4 billions in 2015 and 2016 respectively when former President paid US Dollar 4.5 billions only for year 2014 due to price fluctuations in the international market.
He said the former President never sold the country or its resources to any other foreign nation during his ruling despite the country was embroiled with a civil war and so many economic issues.
It is misleading that country cannot proceed when there is a state debt crisis. It is the present governments lack of efficiency in the state debt management. As the Finance Ministry failed to manage the economy they are continuously putting the blame on Mr. Rajapaksa, he said.
Further, he said the Rupee had depreciated to a lowest ebb during the last two years as a result of Finance Ministries short term surviving policies launched to keep the US Dollar value around Rs 135.
Therefore, MP Gunawardane said no one can accuse Mr. Rajapaksa that he is responsible for the recent economic turmoil and the CB 2016 annual report endorses this facts. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

MYTH: Shaving the head of a newborn can prevent baldness
BUSTED: This is not true. There is no scientific basis for this. But there are many customs and traditions where they shave the babys head. Many newborns have hair which grows while they are in their mothers womb. It is natural for this baby hair to fall anyway. Eventually babies will grow new hair. That is the normal hair cycle. When you shave or cut the hair, the root of the hair is intact. The same hair will re-grow, but once it completes its normal hair cycle it will fall and new hairs will surface.

Night time terror;  Insomnia
	


There is no shadow of a doubt in saying that every one of us has had our share of moments tossing and turning around at night trying to doze off to la la land. Youd try everything from drinking hot milk to counting sheep to lullabies in your desperate attempts to fall asleep. This night time terror we call insomnia tends to visit us every now and then occasionally. But what reality lies behind insomnia What provokes insomnia Are there any effective ways rather than counting sheep to get over this To answer these questions regarding insomnia that constantly quiz the mind, the Health Capsule spoke to Dr.Pushpakumari Ranasinghe, Consultant Psychiatrist at the National Institute of Mental Health, Angoda.

What is insomnia
Insomnia is a sleeping disorder also known simply as sleeplessness. According to Dr.Ranasinghe insomnia attacks are of different forms. Some forms of insomnia keep the person up all night and they find it hard to fall asleep while others cause a person to either wake up earlier than they are supposed to or sleep may be interrupted in between. They are generally classified as short term insomnia and long term insomnia. Most of us get a dose of short term insomnia every now and then which Dr.Ranasinghe assures is normal and is not something to stay up all night and worry about(which could end up giving you something to worry about!). But chronic insomnia i.e. long term insomnia may keep a patient awake for as long as 4 or 5 years in some cases! It is not common but also not something that is unheard of.

Causes for insomnia
Dr.Ranasinghe stated that there are many causes for insomnia and that they differ from person to person but the common causes being depression, anxiety, work schedule, jet lag, daily activities and poor sleep habits, a heavy dinner, drugs and medication, sleep apnea, caffeine and age .Depression is the most common cause for insomnia. When plagued constantly by negative thoughts and distress, people tend to wake up early so they do not get the required sleep time and sleep gets disturbed.People suffering from anxiety disorders face the type of insomnia where they find it hard to fall asleep. Contemplating on worrying thoughts, losses, disappointments, exam and work related stress, goals and targets are often the roots to anxiety that pave the way to insomnia. Another reason that Dr.Ranasinghe highlighted is the busy work schedule that most people have to deal with everyday. Work schedules may not be consistent and are prone to change. Their working hours may alternate from late night shifts to early morning shifts. As no regular sleeping habits are practiced in these kinds of lifestyles, the sleep -wake cycle is disturbed which will ultimately result in sleep disorders.A handful of people who travel complain about sleeplessness. This is because they are suffering from jetlag. When people fly to different countries abroad, they cross the time zone. This alters the schedule they are accustomed to including their sleep habits. People with poor sleep habits definitely end up with insomnia. Taking catnaps in between daytime, burning the midnight oil and studying too much, working late into the hours, can have an effect on your sleep at night.
Something that many of us are charged guilty of is spending too much of time in front of computers, TVs, and not to be considered least, the main problem today ;smart phones. This habit, referred to as screen time by Dr.Ranasinghe, is also another reason that will taunt you with insomnia. Being a foodie will not help this situation in any way because eating too much can keep a person awake. What we always suggest is a light snack before bedtime. Eating too much at night interferes with digestion and causes discomfort that may obstruct falling asleep.Medication taken for other disorders can affect sleep especially when it comes to medical conditions like asthma and thyroid diseases. Another risk factor is sleep apnea. Sleep apnea is a condition where the patient suffers from inhibition of breathing periodically throughout the night. Caffeine in coffee and nicotine from cigars prove another reason that could lead to insomnia. Sleep is also affected by age. Small children tend to sleep a lot. But as they get older, the sleep time decreases. Especially adolescents, they stay up all night and sleep through most of the day. 

Aftermath of insomnia
It is no secret that the lack of a good nights sleep leads to an ill wind on health. Some of the negative effects are reduced stamina and performance, getting easily fatigued, drowsiness, being easily subjected to irritation, annoyance and impatience.

Remedies for insomnia
Dr.Ranasinghe mentioned that short term insomnia is treatable by improving sleeping patterns and she suggests reducing catnaps taken during the daytime, not staying up too late into the night and reducing screen time is a good place to start. She also recommended taking a soak followed by something to munch on that is not too heavy on the taste buds before hitting the hay which will create comfort and make it easier to fall asleep. Working according to a regularized schedule and maintaining a regular bedtime will also enable stability in the sleep cycle ensuring a good nights sleep. The hours of sleep required varies from individual to individual. Some people may require 6 hours of sleep while others might need 8 hours. She strongly advises against the over consumption of caffeine. Relaxation exercises like yoga will also prove beneficial to overcoming short term insomnia.
Long term insomnia which we call chronic insomnia is a more serious case and sometimes we treat patients who havent slept for years. Sometimes the drugs and medication the patients take for other medical complications might be reason to the disruption of the sleep cycle and we have to take their diseases into account during treatment. There is a centre in our brain which responds to light and darkness and secretes hormones that create sleepiness. But the elderly suffering from dementia have no sense of time. So in these cases, patients undergo light therapy where they are exposed to light at regular time intervals to induce sleepiness. Dr.Ranasinghe mentioned.
If patients are constantly nagged by worries and problems they tend to fall victim to chronic insomnia. In such cases where they suffer from mental health instability, they are advised to see a psychiatrist to undergo therapy so that their thinking patterns will be changed which will help them to overcome their worries and thereby to overcome sleeplessness.

No money should spent on luxury vehicles: GL
	
The Joint Opposition said yesterday no money should be spent on luxury vehicle by the government for the ministers use till the Meethotamulla victims are fully compensated.
Addressing a press conference, former Minister Prof. G.L. Peiris said 32 persons were killed in the collapse of the Garbage dump and 334 houses damaged. He said the priority should be given to these victims. He said it was a sinful act to spend Rs. 70 million for a ministers car. He made these remarks following the governments decision to allocate Rs.1.2 billion for luxury vehicles of ministers.
Meanwhile, Prof. Peiris stressed that the government is planning to create additional ministerial portfolios and has allocated Rs. 43 million to purchase vehicles.
We see the difference between the promises and deeds. Is this Yahapalanaya he asked.
Further, he said per capita income has been diminishing at the moment and the Central Bank is printing currency notes indiscriminately without any economic considerations. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

In the wake of a petition submitted by the next of kin of those gone missing, MP M.A. Sumanthiran said today said his party would continue to urge the operation of the Office on Missing Persons (OMP) Act without further delay.
Addressing the next of kin, he said though the OMP Act was passed in parliament the government had failed to set up the OMP.
The reason is because the Act needs to be brought under a ministry by the President as stated in the Constitution, the MP said and added that the President had assured that the Act would be operational after incorporating the proposed amendments.
We will no longer accept this as an excuse because the amendments can be made at anytime. That is no bar the Act being operational or bought under the purview of a particular ministry, he said.
A copy of the letter was also submitted to the Prime Minister and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Speaking on the matter Brito Fernando, a representative of the next of kin said the operation of the OMP Act was a step towards reconciliation.
Despite its shortcomings, we see the Office on Missing Persons Act as an important first step towards revealing the truth about those gone missing, especially Tamil journalists, which has not been given due attention. We also extend our fullest support to the government to ensure that this Act is safeguarded, he said.
Mr. Fernando said it was sad to note the lapse of eight months since the OMP Act was enacted in Parliament in August 2016, with no steps being taken to make it operational.
He said he hoped it would be operational before the international week of the disappeared.(Thilanka Kanakarathna)

Rupee edges down on importer dollar demand; stocks rise
	
REUTERS: The Sri Lankan rupee weakened slightly yesterday as mild importer dollar demand surpassed selling of the U.S. currency by exporters, dealers said.
Rupee forwards were active, with the spot-next or three-day forwards trading at 152.65/75 per dollar at 0635 GMT, compared with Mondays close of 152.60/70.
The spot rupee did not trade yesterday.
The Central Bank fixed the spot rupee reference rate at 152.10 on May 5.
Central Bank Governor Indrajit Coomaraswamy said last week that the monetary authority did not want to allow the rupee to fall too quickly, but suggested further weakness in the exchange rate is on the cards as policymakers sought a competitive currency.
The downward adjustment to the spot currency was to make the rupee more competitive, he added.
The Central Bank has allowed the currency to gradually depreciate since mid-December, revising its spot reference rate multiple times.
We have seen some exporter (dollar) conversions and there is some importer (dollar) demand. But the dollar demand is on the low side, said a currency dealer.
Positive news about trade concessions helped cap losses in rupee forwards,
dealers said.
The European Union said yesterday the countrys GSP Plus trade concessions could be started towards end of this week after the Council of Ministers of the European Union approved the concession last week.
Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake said on Sunday revenue rose 17 percent in the first quarter compared with a year ago, surpassing the governments expectations, due to higher tax collection.
Sri Lanka drew a blowout response in its return to the international bond market, attracting orders of more than US $ 11 billion from 500 accounts for a US $ 1.5 billion 10-year bond.
Currency dealers expect higher dollar liquidity from the inflows to help stabilise
the rupee.

Foreign investors net bought shares worth Rs.281.05 million, extending the year-to-date net foreign inflows to Rs.17.08 billion.
Reduction of 36-38 basis points in T-bill yields in the last three weeks, stable currency on expectation of inflows from foreign borrowing and an International Monetary Fund (IMF) statement on the disbursement of the third tranche of a US $ 1.5 billion loan, have helped boost sentiment, analysts said.

SL backs India's concern over Kashmir in China's connectivity project
	
Sri Lanka, which attended the recently concluded Belt and Road Forum in China, has backed India's concern over the Kashmir issue saying it is difficult for New Delhi to accept the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) as it goes through the "heart of Indian interests," the Economic Times reported on Wednesday.
Special Assignment Minister Sarath Amanugama has said India, which skipped the high-profile meeting, would have joined "very happily" in the One Belt and One Road (OBOR) initiative of China.
"Unfortunately, the issue is going through the heart of Indian interests. If it is some uncontested region, India would have negotiated its way out. Here especially the Kashmir issue getting dragged into it, makes it difficult for India to be flexible," Minister Amanugama, who accompanied Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe told PTI.
He said India, China and Sri Lanka were very much part of the ancient Silk Road route as the Chinese Buddhist scholars like Faxian visited both India and Sri Lanka leading to big discoveries of Buddhist relics in Sri Lanka.
"President Xi Jinping has emphasised connectivity. These countries were connected many centuries ago. This will link up these countries on certain rational basis. Once the regional problems are resolved, then India has to play big role in the initiative," he said adding that India anyway has to play big role.
You cannot think of a belt and road without going over and close to India, he said.
India skipped the meeting due to its sovereignty concerns over the USD 50 billion CPEC, which goes through Pakistan- occupied Kashmir. The two-day conference in Beijing brought together leaders from 29 countries.
Besides Premier Wickremesinghe, the summit was attended by Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, Russian President Vladimir Putin, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and several other leaders, heads of UN, World Bank and IMF.
The minister said Sri Lanka would not permit any foreign military operations in its port by any country including China in an effort to reassure India's security concerns over Chinese military activity.
Confirming reports that recent Chinese requests for docking of its submarines was declined, he said, "We denied them permission."
"Lanka's position is that our harbours and ports are for commercial operations. All other countries have no strategic interests. We are equidistant from everyone. China, India, US and all other countries, they cannot come into our territorial waters without the consent of the Sri Lankan government," the minister said.
Even the Hambantota harbour which Sri Lanka plans to hand over to China under debt to equity swap will function under the Sri Lankan Ports Authority (SLPA).
He said in the agreement currently being finalised to give 80 per cent stake for Chinese shipping company, it would be allowed to operate inside the harbour but all the outside operations would be carried out SLPA.
Allaying India's concerns, he said Sri Lanka is taking assistance from the Indian Navy to maintain maritime security including tracking submarines. India is also providing patrol boats, he said.
"But we are caught up in a debt crisis. Sri Lanka is facing a problem with debt repayment," he said, defending Sri Lanka opting for debt to equity swap in the harbour deal.
Sri Lanka has an estimated debt of USD eight billion to China. The loans were taken for different mega projects.
"Last year we raised it with Premier Li Keqiang. At first we asked for a debt relief, either to write it off or to reschedule payment. But he said it is not possible because they have lent money to several other countries. But suggested that we convert it into equity by forming a joint venture company. It will be registered in Sri Lanka and will be a Sri Lankan company. Chinese side will convert that into equity. Sri Lanka doesn't have to repay," the minister said adding that it was a "win-win situation".

The heart beat with a different tune
	


Have you ever listened to the rhythmic lub-dub of your heart beat, pondered over how it functions or the root causes that may lead to various heart related health problems; including those that fall under the category of Congenital Heart Defects The Health Capsule spoke to Consultant Paediatric Cardiologist, Department of Paediatric Cardiology, Lady Ridgeway Hospital for Children (LRH), Dr. Duminda Samarasinghe; in an attempt to comprehend the intricacies behind Congenital Heart Defects.
Dr. Samarasinghe introduced the topic by defining that Congenital Heart Defects are abnormalities in the heart evident in the patient since birth. According to him, heart diseases can be listed under two categories. The first falls under the category of congenital heart defects and the second type is acquired heart diseases which is acquired at a later stage in life. For an instance, diseases such as rheumatic fever or coronary artery disease are labeled as acquired heart diseases. Stating that congenital heart defects are currently indicating a slight rising trend among patients, he said that this is mainly because the detection of such problems have become more evident at present compared to earlier. Currently the patient detection is more evident thanks to the modern health care facilities we have including qualified paediatricians and Paediatric Cardiologists covering most parts of the country. Paediatric cardiologists are available in Jaffna, Anuradhapura, Kandy, Kurunegala, Galle and Colombo. So, patients are being diagnosed and referred early. Therefore, the number of patients we handle has become more compared to earlier Dr. Samarasinghe said.
Further explaining the nature of congenital heart defects, he said that these heart defects are very often hereditary by nature. If the parents have a congenital heart defect or a sibling is diagnosed with a congenital heart condition, then the risk level of inheriting a similar heart defect is slightly high in a patient. In terms of a percentage, a one percent increase may be witnessed in the general population where six to eight per thousand individuals will be affected by a congenital heart condition. However, this rate can rise up to ten percent if there is a recorded family history where a member has been affected by a similar condition.

Root Causes
If the mother has diabetes during pregnancy or if the mother takes certain drugs such as high doses of steroids, then the possibility of the baby being prone to a congenital heart defect is high. Also, the consumption of alcohol or smoking during pregnancy (cases are rare) and rubella infection during pregnancy can cause congenital heart defects in the baby says Dr. Samarasinghe. In the case of diabetes, babies are vulnerable to develop a heart disease if the mother is going through uncontrolled diabetes. Thus, unless the diabetes is controlled with insulin and other drugs, there is a chance that the baby may develop a congenital heart condition. If the diabetes is properly controlled during pregnancy, the chances of developing such conditions are comparatively less. Also, there is no evidence to support that the mothers food patterns could play a role in giving rise to such diseases he added.

Red flag signs to watch for!
First if a doctor examines a child and detects a murmur in the heart, the patient will be referred to a paediatrician for further examination. It should be noted that a murmur can be detected only by a doctor. Also, if the child gets repeated lower respiratory tract infection which is a condition similar to pneumonia, it could be a possible symptom that the child is having a congenital heart condition. Also repeated attacks of pneumonia may be another indication of a congenital heart defect. Being short of breath, taking rapid breaths, excessive sweating, inability to eat properly, poor sucking and poor weight gain are red flag signs parents should look for in their children. 

Diagnosing congenital heart defects
If a foetal echo is conducted before birth, it is possible to detect early in case there is any congenital ailment. According to Dr. Samarasinghe, a foetal echo is an ultra sound scan of the baby while the baby is still in the womb; ideally conducted between 18- 22 weeks. A foetal echo can detect most of the major deformities. Additionally, an Echocardiogram is an ultra sound examination of the heart which helps diagnose if there is a problem in the heart.There is a 99.9 % chance to make accurate diagnosis using an echocardiogram. Sometimes to gain additional information concerning the condition, further investigation of the patients health condition may be needed. It should be noted that the echocardiogram is the main diagnostic tool that helps diagnose congenital heart conditions in a patient Dr. Samarasinghe added.

Treatment
There are three stages under which a patient can be administered treatment depending on how critical his or her condition is. The first treatment method may involve a definite surgery or catheter intervention on the patient. Under the second method, treatment will not be needed given the fact that the disease is a minor condition. Under the third category the doctor may decide to either conduct a surgery or not depending on the patients heart condition.
Since certain heart conditions that are minor may heal on its own, such conditions can be left untreated life long without any side effects. Patent Foramen Ovale (PFO), tiny Patent DuctusArteriosus (PDA), small Ventricular Septal Defect (VSD), mild narrowing of vessels including tiny holes in the heart can be left untreated depending on the location of the defect he added.
Explaining the function of a catheter intervention, he explained that the doctor will pass a small catheter through the leg to the heart and manipulate the catheter to perform various actions such as valve openings in the heart. However, depending on how critical the condition is, more complex congenital conditions such as certain holes including narrowing of vessels in the heart may be subjected to an open heart surgery. Cases are often very individualistic since they depend upon the condition of each patient. Therefore, he added that such patients are treated depending on the nature of the defect they have and based on how critical the condition is.
Rarely a patient will need to be under medication for a long time. In most cases a catheter intervention or surgery would suffice. It is very rarely that patients are prescribed long term drugs. However, patients who have had a catheter intervention or open heart surgery need to maintain a long term follow up on their health condition through regular checkups mainly to watch for any possible side effects or complications. It should also be noted that not all congenital heart defects are life threatening he added.

Awareness
Awareness concerning congenital heart defects have increased over time. If parents visit us at LRH, then they will be definitely aware whether their child is in need of a surgery or not. The issue is with those who have not visited us and those who are left at home without being diagnosed.
We recently commenced the Little Hearts project which aims to improve facilities for children with heart diseases in Sri Lanka. We need to design a proper cardiac complex in order to carry out our work more smoothly at the LRH. This is a project to construct and commission a ten storey Cardiac and Critical Care Complex at the LRH.At the moment we do nearly thousand surgeries and 600- 700 catheter based interventions at LRH. With this facility coming in, we should be able to do about two thousand cardiac surgeries and thousand catheter interventions. The Sri Lanka College of Pediatricians are currently spear heading this project. We need to raise Rs. 2 billion and so far, we have collected Rs. 120 million. The Government has pledged to donate Rs. 300 million to commence work with the construction of the new facility and the Sri Lanka Navy is currently carrying out the construction work. Donors are welcomed to contribute and their generosity is much appreciated by us he said.

The most likely pick is not willing
	

The countrys defense secretarial chair is due to fall vacant shortly and Number One in yahapalanaya is considering several nominees preparatory to making his pick to fit the bill.

At the top of this list of nominees is a head of a leading commercial bank in the country who once served as a secretary to the countrys first lady Prime Minister.
Next on the list is a doctor in the AGs department and the third on the list is an additional secretary at the main secretariat who functioned as the GA Puttalam sometime ago.
Meanwhile, the head of the bank at the top of the nominees list has indicated his willingness to continue in the current office and this development is likely to prolong the selection process, they say.

The sensation created by the much talked about reshuffle of the pack that has been getting postponed for the last months is likely to end up as a damp squib, they say.

The Green party responsible for postponing the move has now virtually aborted it, they say.
Government had for the last time vowed to carry out the reshuffle on the eve of the Vesak Poya. However, the Green party had again put a spoke in the wheel.
The Green party leadership had pointed out that now that they had already made seating arrangements in keeping with recognized protocol norms at the receptions to be accorded to Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi both at national level and local level, any changes in the top team at this stage would send the seating arrangements haywire and that would reflect on the national unity government. And this argument had done the trick at this time round and Number One is said to have again deferred the event indefinitely, they say.

Top Republicans  demand a full explanation over claims Trump leaked  intel to the Russians
	
US, (Daily Mail, US), 16 May 2017 - Paul Ryan has become the latest leading Republican to speak out as backlash grows following reports the president shared highly classified information with top Russian officials during an Oval Office meeting last week. 
Ryan, the House Speaker, released a statement on Monday night calling for Donald Trump and his office to provide a full account of the meeting in which he is being accused of sharing secrets with Russia. 
We have no way of knowing what was said, but protecting our nations secrets is paramount, the statement from Ryans spokesman, Doug Andres, read. 
The speaker hopes for a full explanation of the facts from the administration. 
The comments came after Bob Corker, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee chairman, was one of the first Republicans to speak out against the White House after reports emerged in the Washington Post.

Trump revealed intelligence  secrets to Russians
	
Embattled US President Donald Trump faced explosive allegations that he divulged top secret intelligence to Russian diplomats in the Oval Office, a charge the White House scrambled to rebut Monday. 
The Washington Post reported that Trump revealed highly classified information on the Islamic State group during a meeting last week with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and Moscows man in Washington Sergey Kislyak. 
In a shock twist, the intelligence reportedly came from a US ally who did not authorize Washington to share it with Moscow. That development that could shatter trust that is essential to intelligence and counterterrorism cooperation. 
National Security Advisor HR McMaster denied the president had revealed intelligence sources or methods, but acknowledged that Trump and Lavrov reviewed a range of common threats to our two countries, including threats to civil aviation. The Post, citing unnamed officials, said that Trump went off script during the meeting, describing details about an Islamic State terror threat related to the use of laptop computers on airplanes, revealing the city where the information was gathered. 
Theres nothing that the president takes more seriously than the security of the American people. The story that came out tonight as reported is false, McMaster said without elaborating on which elements were wrong. On-the-record accounts should outweigh those of anonymous sources. I was in the room. It didnt happen. McMaster earlier refused to answer questions to a group of journalists gathered in the West Wing, saying this is the last place I wanted to be before leaving.

Understanding tobacco addiction
	
You have heard time and time again that smoking is detrimental to health. It says it on the packaging, it says it on the adverts, it says it on the posters and yet you see people lighting up a tobacco filled tube at every nook and corner. Why, given all these warnings do people continue to smoke
Among the negative health outcomes of smoking, addiction is seen as a principal culprit. The smoke contains psychoactive substances such as nicotine that bind to the special nicotine receptors found in the central nervous system of our body and trigger the reward mechanism of our brain that releases dopamine, the neurotransmitter of pleasure, eventually elevating the mood and causing euphoria or calmness. This reward serves as a positive reinforcement that pushes the smoker to burn through more and more cigarettes over time. Addiction leads to compulsive smoking that eventually induces dependence. Nicotine dependence is the strong, overpowering desire to smoke due to its rewarding outcomes and also to avoid withdrawal symptoms (i.e irritability, aggressiveness, sleep disturbance) Exposure to high concentrations of nicotine desensitizes the aforementioned nicotine receptors thus creating a phenomenon called tolerance where a higher dose of the substance is needed to create the same effect. This desire dominates the lifestyle as well as the quality of life of the smoker that causes harm to himself as well as the community.
According to a study by the Alcohol and Drug Information Center, 33% of the male population above the age of 15 are tobacco smokers. Smoking in females is not that uncommon either. Tobacco was chewed and smoked through pipes during out great grandparents years whereas cigarettes owe up to 98% of the tobacco consumption in the modern day.
QWhat does a cigarette contain
It is important to know the contents of a cigarette since most of them are present in the body of a smoker and to a lesser extent in people who inhale second-hand smoke (the involuntary inhalation of smoke from other peoples cigarettes) and third-hand smoke ( residual nicotine and chemicals left on various indoor surfaces). The latter two are also known as passive smoking, both posing as a significant health hazard in non-smokers exposed to it. Tobacco contains the chemically active compound nicotine (a neurotoxin similar to most venoms found in animals but in lower concentrations) as its main component apart from carcinogenic (causing cancer) tars and carbon monoxide (CO) that is a toxic gas making up 50% of the cigarette while the remainder constitutes of certain add-ons that enhance the absorption of nicotine to the body. Tars are toxic components that are also responsible for the brown staining of teeth and skin and easily reflects the staining of lungs and the entire respiratory and alimentary passages. 
The number of chemical compounds within the cigarettes and produced when lit up is by the thousands with most of them considered to be highly toxic and carcinogenic. For example acetone-a chemical found in thinner, ammonia-found in disinfectants, fertilizers and explosives, anabasive-an industrial insecticide, heavy metals such as chromium that is found in paint, mercury, lead- found in batteries and bullets and also a potent neurotoxin that builds up within human soft tissue and damages the nervous system. Hydrogen cyanide-considered a highly toxic substance used to temper steel and create explosives and sadly used by the Nazis for genocide in gas chambers. Research has revealed more than 60 carcinogenic chemicals found in cigarettes including acetaldehyde that is an intermediate of many chemical reactions, arsenic found mostly in pesticides and herbicides, benzene- found in rubbers and dyes, cadmium, formaldehyde-used in preservation of human corpses and body parts, Nickel-found in stainless steel.
Average cigarette contains 0.8g of tobacco and 9-17mg of nicotine, of which 10% is absorbed by the smoker, increasing the bodys nicotine concentration upto 100-200 nmol/l. Nicotine is rapidly absorbed in the body by lungs and poorly absorbed through the mouth and nasopharynx thus making inhalation mandatory to achieve reasonable absorption. The nicotine concentration in the body varies with the smoking habits of a person hence provides a useful measure of his smoking behaviour. The inhaled substance (containing about 4000 chemical compounds and among those, 60 known carcinogens) is distributed all over the body that contribute to the unfavourable health outcomes discussed below. In addition, metabolism of these compounds within the body, adds up to the number of toxic contents.

War hero is facing a battle
	

Several Green party seniors have reportedly registered their strong reservations against the proposed move to offer a top post in the party to Fonny, the war hero. Two stalwarts among the seniors have expressed their unequivocal opposition to the proposed offer.

Of these unbending two, one is a purohita and a legal luminary to boot. The other is a young top team member hailing from Uva.
The lawyer- purohita had prior to the Green partys decision-making bodys meeting last Monday conveyed his reservations about the proposed move to the Green leader and also to the leaders right royal pal handling international trade. However, the right royal pal had immediately washed his hands off the issue saying that he did not want to go against a decision taken by the party. Not to be outdone the lawyer-purohita had issued his ultimatum: If Fonny is in, Ill be out.
Meanwhile, the young purohita from Uva has reportedly decided to resign himself to any eventuality following a reprimand by the Green leader. There is an anti-Fonny group functioning behind the scene as well. This group will leave no stone unturned in their bid to abort the controversial move, they say.

When to worry about your forgetfulness
	

Everyone stumbles upon confusion and forgetfulness at some point in their lives. It is often one of the first signs that age is finally catching up with you. But what would you do if forgetfulness was slowly creeping into your life, compromising your overall mental and physical wellbeing
In a previous weeks edition of Health Capsule we shed light on the causes and symptoms of Alzheimers disease, the most common form of dementia, present among adults over 60 years of age. This week Health Capsule helps you understand forgetfulness which may be a symptom of a more complicated underlying disease.
Consultant Ayurvedic Physician, Dr. Indunil Waidyaratne says some of the symptoms of the disease such as mild confusion and forgetfulness may even pose risks to a patients lives. Sometimes a person may forget to switch an electrical appliance off, or leave the stove on with a boiling pot. Smokers may leave a lit cigarette lying around the house. If such behaviour goes unnoticed, it may threaten the lives of their family members as well.
In the case of Alzheimers disease, brain damage caused by the disease will eventually reach the Parietal Lobe of the brain, as it progresses. The parietal lobe is located above the ear which receives and interprets sensations of pain, pressure, temperature, touch, size, shape, and awareness of body parts. In most people, the left side of the parietal lobe is thought to be dominant, as it processes information allowing us to read, write, and make calculations. The non-dominant side of the parietal lobe, usually the right side, helps us picture the world around us by processing appearances. When Alzheimers affect these parts of the brain a persons ability to speak, explain and remember will deteriorate. This deterioration will be apparent in a person who is trying to explain something to you but has difficulty in remembering the words or incidents related to it. As the disease advances a patient will be unable to identify friends, family and other familiar things.
However for some elderly people, there is no cause for alarm. Some of these symptoms may not be entirely because of a frightening disease as Alzheimers. There can be a number of illnesses that plague the brain and result in memory loss and other problems. In case you identify some of these symptoms, it is always best to visit your doctor who will be able to diagnose and treat your ailments effectively. It is also important to remember that while some diseases have cures, some ailments can only be managed.
Tumours, blood clots and infections in the brain can cause mild to severe memory loss. Certain diseases such as Syphilis can also display such symptoms of memory Loss. Even though Syphilis is a sexually transmitted infection caused by bacteria and is curable, if left untreated, it can cause serious damage to the brain, heart, nervous system, and even lead to death. Incurable diseases such as AIDS are also known to cause symptoms of mild confusion.
Of the less threatening conditions that are known to cause forgetfulness, an underactive thyroid gland takes a prominent place. Also known as Hypothyroidism, the condition slows the processing of nutrients to create energy for cells (metabolism). Hypothyroidism can result in forgetfulness and other thinking problems. A high consumption of alcohol and a deficiency of Vitamin B12 could also result in mild forgetfulness.
Cerebral circulation is the blood flow in your brain. Its important for healthy brain function. Circulating blood supplies your brain with the oxygen and nutrients it needs to function properly. Blood delivers oxygen and glucose to your brain. When there is poor blood circulation in the brain it can cause impaired cognitive function, affecting brain functions causing memory loss, difficulty concentrating and being less focused. Most individuals are susceptible to memory loss during their lifetime. Nevertheless patients with high blood pressure and those who suffer from mental ailments such as depression can easily develop symptoms of memory loss. Fortunately most of these less threatening illnesses can be cured.

Ayurvedic draughts
According to Dr. Waidyaratne, the following ayurvedic draughts made with the following ingredients can alleviate symptoms of forgetfulness and assist in improved focus.
Draughts made with Iramusu, (Indian sarsaparilla) decoction of Sudu Handun (white sandal wood), Beli root (Golden Apple), Rasakinda (Heart leaved mooseed), Babila root, Sassanda and bees honey.
A concoction of Iramusu, decoction of Sudu Handun, Bees honey, sugar and ghee.
Extract of Alu puhul (White gourd) with bees honey
Other remedies
Wel penela, Wetake stem, Babila leaf ground with king coconut water to be applied on the skull.
Mukunuwenna leaf ground with king coconut water to be applied on the skull.
Green gram, Ath kaha (Turmeric), Sudu Handun, Aloe, Nelli, Girithilla, boiled in fresh milk, and to be reduced and applied on the head.

Why he is active in the night
	

There is a prominent purohita from the Colombo district suffering from insomnia - the inability to sleep.

So the poor man remains awake until morning hours.
Although his condition  being unable to have some shuteye  is a big personal problem to him, he had realized recently that he could use this personal liability to his political advantage.
So the purohita has begun making nocturnal inspection visits to his Ministry and institutions coming under its purview. Judging by the complimentary remarks being made by many people - some describe him as a workhorse  the purohitas newly acquired practice of making nocturnal inspection visits have given a big boost to his political standing. However, those who are in the know of the secret behind his latest practice consider it a good joke.
In fact, several Green party seniors who met for a chat following an important weekly meeting is said to have had a good laugh over the purohitas new-found dedication to his work.
