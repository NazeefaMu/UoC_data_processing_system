All should strive to dispel myth of inferiority attributed to women: SL in Geneva
	
Sri Lanka has emphasized at a recent UN event held in Geneva that it is incumbent on all stakeholders to strive to create a culture of respect for equality and non-discrimination and to work towards dispelling the myth of inferiority attributed to women over centuries.
Sri Lanka?s Permanent Representative to the UN Ambassador A.L.A. Azeez expressed these views while addressing the Intersessional Expert Meeting on the full enjoyment of human rights by all women and girls and the systematic mainstreaming of gender perspective into the implementation of the 2030 Agenda which was held in Geneva on May 2.
Ambassador Azeez said promotion of gender equality, sustained through collective efforts to empower women and girls to play a lead role in decision making, is an integral part of the global vision for Sustainable Development Agenda 2030.
?The UN Commission on the Status of Women has addressed this important aspect comprehensively during its deliberations and outcomes in the recent past. Further, the Security Council has also emphasized the pivotal link between gender equality and international peace and security through its resolution 1325,? he said in a statement.
He said the rise of hatred and extremism that is often manifested in its ruthless forms in several areas of the world, feeds violent tendencies making women bear the brunt of discrimination and exclusion.
?Women confront varying challenges, silently and alone. They suffer from multiple forms of discrimination and marginalization. During conflicts, more often than not, they lose not just their voices but their dignity too comes under severe stress. It devolves on Governments as well as all stakeholders, to take targeted special measures to protect women and girls from gender-based violence and other forms of abuse. We believe that leaving out women and girls in development and in peace and security, is a ?loss for the world as it puts a damaging brake on progress towards sustainable development,? he said.
Meanwhile, Ambassador Azeez said Sri Lanka has launched the National Action Plan to prevent gender based violence (GBV) which is currently under implementation.
He said the empowerment of women is among the foremost priorities that receives focused attention in the 2030 Sustainability Sri Lanka Strategy which is being finalised.
?Women?s representation in local government authorities in Sri Lanka has been minimal until early this year. The mandatory 25% quota for women introduced by law last year has increased their participation in policy and decision making in local government bodies. This, no doubt, assures them of an opportunity to transform themselves into leadership positions at provincial and national levels in the future,? he said.
He said these achievements need to be consolidated while endeavouring to further enhance the participation of women in key sectors of development and economy.
?Achieving gender equality is not just an issue of women and girls; it goes way beyond, calling for the active involvement of all stakeholders,? he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

MP Samaraweera said TNA Parliamentarian M. A. Sumanthiran had stating to a national newspaper, had vowed that he would never allow constructing Buddhist temples and had backed this issue from 2011.
He said the NFF strongly condemned MP Sumanthiran?s racist statement.
He also explained that Buddhism which harboured and practiced ?Meththa? (love and kindness) did not crate any harm or threat to any other religions.
?This country was built based on the essence of Buddhist culture. It had never created any restrictions to the Hindu, Catholic or Islamic religions to function while safeguarding their identities. Buddhist culture had always led towards true national and religious reconciliation,? he said.
The NFF Organiser also added that the NFF was not surprised by the TNA?s request but the entire Buddhists should pay their attention to such statements as the Unity Government administration could grant such a demand in the future in order to retain their power. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

Fielding President Sirisena as common candidate in 2015 was a mistake: SF
	
Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka said today that fielding incumbent President Maithripala Sirisena as the common candidate in 2015 was a mistake.
? I told Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe to contest the last presidential election but the party supported a common candidate instead. This was a blunder ? Field Marshal said while addressing the party?s May Day rally.
He said the UNP should make use of the Samurdi and Labour ministries to work for the people. ? Former Labour Minister only focused on bringing former defense secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa to forefront and the former Samurdi minister was only played politics. However we should turn Samurdi as a people?s friendly program? he added.(Yohan Perera)

SL asks IOM to setup health review program for resident visa applicants
	
The UN Migration Agency, International Organization for Migration (IOM) and the Health Ministry on Friday signed a Memorandum of Understanding for the establishment of a health assessment program for foreign nationals applying for Sri Lankan residence visas.
In a statement, the IOM said the program will be set up by IOM on a ?build-operate-transfer? basis, which will allow the ministry to take it over once it is up and running.
?Since the end of Sri Lanka?s long running civil conflict in 2009, the country has seen a significant increase in foreign investment and tourist arrivals. Mega investment projects such as the Colombo Port City, Hambantota Port and the signing of several free trade agreements with neighboring countries have resulted in a spike in arrivals of foreign nationals, including migrant workers.
pplications for both residence and work visas are increasing rapidly,? it said.
It was reported that many of the migrant workers are arriving from countries with a higher disease burden than Sri Lanka, which has made progress in combating communicable diseases and has some of the best health indicators in the region.
The health assessment program will screen for four health conditions: active TB, HIV/AIDS, malaria, and filariasis. Anyone testing positive for any of the diseases will be referred to the government health system for treatment paid for through a health insurance scheme to be set up as part of the program.
While they undergo the prescribed treatment, they will be issued with an interim visa to stay in the country and will be monitored by the Health Ministry for treatment compliance. The interim visa will grant the same rights to work or study as the residence visa.
IOM Sri Lanka Chief of Mission Giuseppe Crocetti said the new cooperation framework is a first of its kind for IOM globally.
?It is a major achievement and reflects the long running partnership between IOM and Sri Lanka in advancing the migrant health agenda,? he said.
Meanwhile, Health Ministry Secretary Janaka Sugathadasa said Sri Lanka is globally appreciated for its public health achievement of having eliminated malaria and filariasis, and keeping HIV and tuberculosis at low prevalence.
?This inbound health assessment will further consolidate the public health achievements of the country,? he said.

UNP will form its own Govt. in 2020: PM
	
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe today said the United National Party (UNP) would form its own government in 2020.
?We will form a UNP government in 2020. This is the objective behind the party?s recent reorganization. I am not looking at a government which will last only for five years but one that will last for 20 to 25 years. However, I will not be able to do it alone. Others in the party should come forward to fulfil this task,? he said at the UNP?s May Day rally held at the Sugathadasa Stadium. ?Former president J.R. Jayawardene created a second level leadership in the 1970s and in the 80s. I have also done the same. Therefore, new leaders will emerge from the UNP in the years to come and the party will be able to name successors.?
The Prime Minister asked the members to set up mini Sirikotha offices in the constituencies and pledged to expand Samurdhi. He said UNPers who had been subjected to political victimization will be taken care of as well employment would be provided to the youth in the government and the private sector.
The Premier apologised to the party supporters who were unable to enter the indoor stadium because of the lack of space.
Deputy Leader Sajith Premadasa stressed the need for an urgent welfare package and suggested providing fertilizer free of charge, free school uniforms and shoes to school children and absorbing UNPers to the public service .
?It is a do or die situation which the party is facing now,? he said and added that the party?s next presidential candidate should be named at Galle Face Green. ?My father, the former president Ranasinghe Premadasa was named as the presidential candidate at the Sugathadasa Stadium in 1988 where we are holding our May Day rally today. However, I suggest that we should name our next presidential candidate at the Galle Face Green."
Mr. Premadasa said the UNP?s next presidential candidate would campaign with the report on the progress of the 2,500 village reawakening programme in his hands.
?I am willing to accept any unanimous decision taken by the party and go along with my late father?s policies," he said.
