A tuck-tuck to make an extra buck
	
?
There is a two star-rank cop working as a tuck-tuck driver to earn an additional income,?they say.
?
This cop clever at warming his way into the graces of powerful politicos, is often seen driving the tuck-tuck in uniform. Those of higher rank in the service reportedly turn a blind eye to the unethical conduct of this cop. Meanwhile, the other tuck-tuck drivers in the area complain that their khaki-clad colleague is bullying them abusing the clout of his rank.??

The Association of Former International Civil Servants (AFICS) Sri Lanka was launched in 1993, with the late Dr. Gamini Corea, former Secretary-General of UNCTAD, as the first President. The membership comprised a group of Sri Lankans - scientists, doctors, engineers, agriculturists, economists and administrators, who had served the United Nations family and other international organizations such as the Commonwealth Secretariat and?Regional Banks.?
?
The objectives of the Association were defined as promoting the purposes and activities of organizations and bodies of the United Nations system and other international organizations; fostering friendly relations and intellectual contacts among its members, establishing and maintaining a data-base of former international civil servants from Sri Lanka for the purpose, among others, of identifying and providing appropriate expertise to governmental, non-governmental and international agencies if and when requested. This latter activity is expected to contribute to the social and economic development of the country.? ?
During the tsunami period AFICS rose to great heights. AFICS built a house in Hikkaduwa; carried out mental health projects in eight Grama Seva Niladhari Divisions in Hikkaduwa to reduce mental health concerns and psycho-social disorders among post-tsunami victims; assisted in carrying out a health survey of the community and a rapid assessment of drinking water practices among the target population.

AFICS responded to a popular request from the female members of Kirillapone Community for training facility in sewing, which they intended to use for self-employment. A four months? course was inaugurated for eight members. AFICS submitted a proposal to find partial funding for this project to the Chairman of IDEAS, in addition to the support extended by the community to facilitate it by providing lunch and transport. Thus, this project was collaborated by Singer Company, AFICS and IDEAS. The project is being implemented successfully.? ?
Two members who had served with WHO played a role in the WHO Declaration of Malaria and served on the Dengue Oversight Committee which advises the Ministry of Health, Sri Lanka.? ?
The Association also gives due consideration to the United Nations Millennium Develop

Beyond the Match: In the name of humanity
	
The two days that followed the government?s announcement that things had returned to normal in Kandy were tempestuous; rains, full of sound and thunder, almost like a catharsis to the horror that had preceded them.
?May the rains wash away the racism,? was how one commentator put it on Twitter. It would be unbecoming of me not to suggest that this is what we, the majority, want. The lives lost of the two peoples -- one the Sinhalese and the other Muslims, can never be brought back, but mercifully those deaths did not trigger a pogrom.
Instead we saw members of the clergy, from both sides of the divide, work with each other even in areas where pogroms could easily have occurred. Hence last Friday, the day of prayer and reflection for Muslims, passed on peacefully. If only the reactions of the elite and the born-again liberals were as worthy of praise as that.? ?
In ?Big Match 1983?, Yasmin Gooneratne ends with these?prophetic lines:? ?
Near the wheels of his?smashed bicycle,
at the corner of Duplication Road a child lies dead,? ?
and two policemen look the?other way,? ?
as a stout man, sweating with fear, falls to his knees,? ?
beneath a Bo-tree in a shower of sticks and stones,? ?
flung by his neighbour?s hands??
The joys of childhood, friendships of our youth,??
ravaged by pieties and politics,?
screaming across our screens?her agony,? ?
at last exposed, Sri Lanka burns alive.
? ?
We need to think beyond this simplistic model which assumes that the panacea to all evil in the world is membership of a particular clique, belonging more often than not to a?privileged circle?
What is worse than the excesses of the chauvinist, like the administrators of the Mahason Balakaya, is the indifference of those who speak loftily about those sunshine days which they spent with friends from other ethnicities. The joys of childhood, juxtaposed with the showers of sticks and stones we hurl, for me brings up a point of contrast between the milieu to which those two groups belong to the stunted peasantry on the one hand and the obese privileged on the other. I am aware that I am generalising a little here, but my act of generalising is based on a desire to point out that while the fires burn, while racism swings both ways and takes this country closer to its imminent death, the privileged, regardless of ethnic and religious affiliations, continue to remember their sunshine days and reflect on a reality that was true only for their milieu.? ?
If we are to progress, if we are to get rid of racism, if not completely then at least effectively, we need to think beyond the friends we made when we were at school, the harmonious relationships we kept alive in our childhood and the various shops and eateries we frequented which were owned by those who belonged to other races and religions. We need to think beyond the institutions of privilege ? at school or elsewhere ? which guaranteed an absence of racial disparities and chauvinism. No consensus has ever been reached with respect to the assumption, sustained by quite a number of people here, that membership of esoteric institutions in the longer term does away with racism. Chauvinists and racists tend to house those privileged quarters too, and far from embracing other collectives through the culture of coexistence rooted in these institutions, they tend to turn into renegades and vent out their chauvinist streak in?terrible ways.? ?
We need to think beyond this simplistic model which assumes that the panacea to all evil in the world is membership of a particular clique, belonging more often than not to a privileged circle that defines itself by differentiating itself from the rest of the country. The ordinary Sinhalese, Tamil, Muslim, and Burgher man or woman on the street, who is not a member of and has never been near such institutions of privilege, cannot and will not take notice of those who hail from them when they set about giving vent to their racist rants and raves. Those who suffered from both ends in Kandy, in that sense, neither affirm nor care about the assumptions we make with respect to the link between those institutions and the (supposed) absence of chauvinism which distinguishes them. Racism is real and alive most potently in less privileged, if not unprivileged, cultural spaces, which those who speak in high-heeled (!) terms about the friendships they inculcated at their schools probably aren?t aware of. Again, I am generalising here for a reason.? ?
Instead we saw members of the clergy, from both sides of the divide, work with each other even in areas where pogroms could easily have occurred and last Friday?s prayers passed on peacefully
Simply put, we cannot get out of this conundrum, this clash of civilisations within a larger, homogenous civilisation, if we inculcate in our schoolchildren an attitude of indifference towards such a clash with the excuse, ?Hey, we learned not to fight with each other over our ethnic and religious backgrounds when we were at school, so why don?t you all just shut up, shove it in, and let us guide you???
Such an attitude reeks of ignorance at best and elitism at worst, and it explains why, as a friend of mine put it through a Facebook post the other day, our post-1948 political experience has been marred so much; because in that post-independence era, the country ended up swerving between two pillars of power (the UNP and the SLFP) which were housed by the same privileged, elitist meritocrats who believed (what else?) that membership of privileged quarters was the magic potion that could do away with all evil. It?s that attitude which, while clearly dying (and thankfully), has delegitimized any genuine attempt at brokering peace in the eyes of the ordinary Sinhalese, Tamil and Muslim.? ?
My friend (and a great friend at that, by the way) Hafeel Farisz, interviewing C.V. Wigneswaran more than a year ago, posed a rather interesting question: ?Isn?t it a fact that from the time of Navalar or Dharmapala or Bandaranaike to Chelvanayagam, and now to you, it was [always] the elite who fought their political battles at the expense and the blood of the common man??? ?
I like Hafeel?s brash honesty and I have come to appreciate the points he raises and the questions he asks, even if they are derided and vilified by half the country. In this case especially, I appreciate and agree with his question, because it?s a question that provides its own answer. Because yes, it was the elite, and yes, the same elite that Yasmin wrote about in her poem, as the schoolboys danced away, watched the match in progress, yelled to their heart?s content, and celebrated the diversity they had institutionalised in their closed, privileged quarters, while the rest of the country, comprising not of them and me, but of the ordinary Sinhalese, Tamil and Muslim farmers and civil servant, burnt.? ?
Racism is real and alive most potently in less privileged, if not unprivileged, cultural spaces
So what have we learned? That the friend I alluded to, with his Facebook post, provided the best answer; that on a superficial level, we have something to blame for everything that is wrong with this country; the exemplary leadership that these elites, hailing from their closeted quarters, unleashed on?
this country.?
From Bandaranaike onwards, that leadership didn?t lead us to the Promised Land. It led us instead to Vaddukoddai, 1983, Aluthgama, and now Digana.? ?

Cabinet nod to set up 'Reparation Office'
	
Following the establishment of the Office on Missing Persons, the government has decided to constitute a ?Reparation Office? to pay compensation to the families of victims of war, victims of civil unrest, enforced disappearance or victims of human rights violations.
A proposal made to the cabinet in this regard by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe got the cabinet nod last week.
With the establishment of the ?Office for Reparations?, all Sri Lankan citizens will get the opportunity irrespective of their race or religion, including families of police and security forces personnel, civilians in border villages that faced difficulties and all affected persons in all parts of the country to submit claims for compensation, Mr. Wickremesinghe told the cabinet in his memo. .
?There is a need for an independent institution to be set up to provide reparations, in terms of policies as may be approved from time to time by the Cabinet of Ministers, with regard to serious violations of human rights or humanitarian law which occurred,? he said. (Sandun A Jayasekera)

Extending state of emergency: PM to consult President
	
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe is to discuss a request made by the defence authorities to extend the state of emergency with President Maithripala Sirisena, sources close to Mr. Wickremesinghe said yesterday.
The defence authorities had suggested that it would be wise to delay lifting the state of emergency until the investigations on the recent incidents in Kandy are concluded.
Sources from the Prime Minister's office said defence authorities, including the Chief of Defense Staff, had requested that the emergency is extended till investigations into the incidents in Kandy are completed. They had also informed the Prime Minister that 70 percent of the investigations had been completed as of now.
Sources said the Prime Minister will refer the matter to President Sirisena when he returns from Japan today (16).
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister had proposed that four ministries namely Buddha Sasana, Disaster Management, Posts and Muslim Affairs and Resettlement, Rehabilitation and Prison Reforms should jointly handle the task of assessing and paying compensation to those who were affected by the recent riots in Kandy.
Sources said temples and mosques which were damaged will also be compensated. (Yohan Perera)

Getting up and moving on with life
	
?
Frequent falls are among the commonest medical complaints made by senior citizens. Not only do falls affect a person?s confidence, it can have serious medical complications ranging from immediate death to fractures causing long term confinement to one?s bed. Falls that have been mentioned here usually aren?t the result of a single factor. They are caused due to a multitude of issues. By getting an idea about these causative factors, we can prevent or at least minimize the risk of falling. Health Capsule consulted Dr. Dilhar Samaraweera, Consultant Physician of the Colombo South Teaching Hospital and Founder President of the Sri Lanka Association of Geriatric Medicine, to obtain more information on the topic.??
According to the doctor, at least 1/3rd of the population above 65 years of age have experienced at least one fall. This gets commoner with advancing age, with at least 1/2 belonging to the above 80 population experiencing a fall. A significant number of them goes on to experience recurrent falls, meaning more than two falls within a duration of six months.??
?
Risk of falls??
?Falls can affect all three physical, mental and social health of a patient?, said Dr. Samaraweera. A fall can increase a person?s chance of dying by 22% while having the potential to reduce the quality of life significantly. ?In fact, more than 90% of hip fractures, one of the most difficult fractures to manage, are estimated to be caused due to falls?, he further stated.??
?
Reasons for falling??
Dr. Samaraweera explained that falls are usually multi-factorial, meaning more than one causative factor is behind these falls. These factors can be divided into internal and external factors; internal factors being the change of internal environment of the body and external factors being the issues in outside environment, facilitating falls.??
The main cause for the increased risk of falling with advanced age is frailty, explained the doctor. Older age brings frailty, which makes them vulnerable to even minor stressors in the environment due to reduced resilience. The muscles become weaker; a condition called sarcopenia. The bones become more fragile due to osteoporosis. Sensations including visual, hearing and touch awareness are reduced, all of which contribute to the risk of falling.??
The person may be suffering from conditions affecting his vision, may that be cataract, glaucoma or macular degeneration causing reduced vision, or using outdated spectacles.? As much as it is difficult to believe, hearing loss also has a place in increased risk of falls. Reduced sound cues that we unconsciously analyze to collect information about the environment as well as reduced attention to other senses like vision due to focusing more on hearing may explain this. A significant portion of the senior population suffers from hearing loss. Even when they are using hearing aids, they can be affected because some may not use it as instructed.??
In addition, problems in balancing, due to middle ear pathology, may also contribute to falling while staying upright because of the feeling of dizziness it causes, explained the doctor.??
Reduced sensation of the feet, due to ageing or because of conditions like long term diabetic, can be a cause to falling. In addition, arthritis of the legs, causing deformities in the toes and pain in the knees, flat feet and other problems of the feet and leg are big contributors to falls, according to Dr. Samaraweera.??
?We all have a sway to our bodies when we walk. This sway is increased when we age. Women naturally have a larger sway compared to men, and with ageing, the risk of falls in women is more when compared to men,? continued the doctor.??
Forgetfulness is a common occurrence of ageing. This may cause reduced awareness of the surroundings, causing the patients to wander in unsafe places, causing falls, he explained.? In addition to these factors, a person who has suffered a stroke recently is likely to experience more falls due to weakness of limbs. Alcohol and urinary incontinence can also increase the risk.??
?
Medications can cause?falls too??
The medicine that the person uses may contribute to falls. Especially anti-hypertensives can make the blood pressure drop too low, causing dizziness and falls, said Dr. Samaraweera.?
Polypharmacy, or prescribing a large number of drugs can especially contribute to falls. ?Sometimes doctors prescribe a large number of unnecessary drugs to patients. In addition to the individual side effects of the pills, they may interact and cause other additional problems as well,? he cautioned.??
In addition to these internal problems factors in the outside environment like furniture, low lightning and slippery floors can also be major contributors in falls. The importance of the external environmental factors counts. They can be modified to suit a person?s needs, minimizing the risk of falls.??
?
Moving on with life??
Consequences of falls can be threefold; affecting physical, mental and social health of a victim. But while the effect of a fall can be devastating, it?s important to keep in mind that failure lies not in falling down, but in not deciding to get up and move on with life after the fall. Let?s talk more on the topic of falls in elderly population, how they affect a person?s life and what we can do to prevent falls in the second part of this article.??

While rejecting claims made by several officials, Bodu Bala Sena (BBS) Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Dilanthe Withanage said Venerable Galagodaaththe Gnanasara Thera?s recent visit to Japan was not pre-planned or not aimed at the official visit of President Maithripala Sirisena.
Speaking to the Daily Mirror he said Ven. Gnanasara Thera planned to visit for Japan for the renewal of his Resident Visa offered by the Japanese Government, before the expiry of the due date.
However, his scheduled visit was got late following several isolated incidents occurred in Kandy.
?Ven. Gnanasara Thera had to visit Japan for his Japanese Resident Visa renewal and in-view of the scheduled 60, 000 Cheevara Pooja (offering of robes) at the Ruwan Veli Maha Chetiya in Anuradhapura on May 19. There was no connection of the President?s visit to Japan,? Mr Withanage said.
?Even Ven. Gnanasara Thera?s visit to the Imperial Hotel in Tokyo on Tuesday has happened following the request by the chief incumbent of a Japanese Temple that the Thera used to visit.
?Before he left for Japan he got permission from several courts where cases are pending to be herd and somehow the Thera had forgotten to get permission for a case that was to be held on Thursday (15),? he said.
Several photographs are circulating on some websites and several social media showing the Venerable Gnanasara Thera at events where President Sirisena spoke.
?However, Ven. Gnanasara Thera was not scheduled to attend the events but so happened to be in Japan at the same time and was at the events,? Mr Withanage said.?(Chaturanga Samarawickrama)

Govt. trying to outsource surveying to US company: Surveyors
	
The Government Surveyors? Association (GSA) today resort to a countrywide indefinite work stoppage claiming that there was a move to hand over several operations of the Sri Lanka Surveys Department (SLSD), the second oldest department of the country, to a US-based company.
Speaking to the Daily Mirror, GSA President Duminda Udugoda referred to an attempt to transfer the duties of the SLSD including Land Information System (LIS) and Aerial Survey Operations to ?Trimble Navigation Ltd?, a US-based land administration solutions group, under the guise of providing title deeds to landowners.
Mr Udugoda said the Cabinet approval had been sought to the proposal to handing over the operation under a foreign loan obtain for USD 154 million (Rs.25, 000 million) although the department was capable of completing the task for Rs.10, 000 million.
It was learned that the approval had been sought without a proper tender procedure in an arbitrary decision of several top officials to be retired soon.
Mr Udugoda revealed the attempt could also threaten the national security as according to the measure Trimble Navigation Ltd is permitted to scan the landowner's eye and get their Biometric authentication and there was a threat to people?s privacy as well.
?In the proposed mechanism the company can?t provide a clear title deed as it can?t provide a clear blue print of the land,? Mr Udugoda said.
Following a discussion with the Prime Minister?s Coordinating Secretary yesterday, the GSA members were informed that their matter would be discussed with Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and their matter would be addressed on Wednesday (21).
However, Mr Udugoda said their work stoppage would not conclude until the authorities revoke the proposal.
The Daily Mirror was the first to reveal the attempt on January 19 last year and responding to our inquiry regarding the matter, SLSD Additional Surveyor General (Field) K. A. Kasthuri said that such an operational devolution had not yet been introduced. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

Miracle behind coconut oil
	
?
Coconut is one of the major plantation crops in our country. It is the favourite choice of Sri Lankans when they have to use oil for cooking. In addition the oil is a popular constituent in beauty products due to the various health and nutritional benefits it possesses. However, people have certain doubts regarding the nutritional aspects of coconut oil since it is rich in saturated fatty acids when compared with other vegetable oils.? ?
The process?
Coconut oil is derived from the kernel of the coconut (Cocos nucifera). Coconut oil extraction is done in two ways; the dry process and the wet process. In the dry process, copra is used to extract the coconut oil whereas in the wet process, coconut oil is extracted from coconut milk.? ?
Types of oil?
In our local market, coconut oil is available in different grades based on the coconut oil extraction method that?s used.? ?
1. White coconut oil- This oil is extracted from good quality copra and retains natural coconut taste, flavour and nutritional value. This product is ideal for frying.? ?
2. Refined bleached and deodorized (RBD) coconut oil- This oil is extracted from copra where the process involves a dried form of coconut kernel. This product is ideal for cooking. Some refined oils are hydrogenated and may contain trans-fat.? ?
3. Virgin coconut oil- This oil is extracted from fresh coconut flesh at low temperature. The oil has not been exposed to any chemicals or bleach that are required in the refining process. In both dry and wet extraction of virgin coconut oil, the brown thin skin of coconut kernel is avoided. As a result, the extracted virgin coconut oil is colorless. It has higher antioxidant content, vitamin C and stronger coconut taste.? ?
4. Pairing oil- This oil is extracted from fresh pairings resulted from the desiccated coconut, coconut cream from the coconut milk industry. It has a very high flavour and is ideal for frying and cooking.? ?
5. Industrial coconut oil-This oil is extracted from low grade copra and is suitable for industrial purposes.?
?
Health benefits?
1. Thermal stability
Coconut oil?s composition is unique and 90 % of its fatty acids are saturated. Coconut oil is heat stable because it contains saturated fatty acids which have high thermal stability compared to polyunsaturated fatty acids. Therefore, coconut oil is considered as the most suitable oil for frying purposes.? ?
2. Reduces the risk of fat deposition
Coconut oil contains over 90 % of short or medium chain fatty acids while it naturally contains a mixture of medium chain fatty acids and long chain fatty acids in a ratio of 3:1. However, these short and medium chain fatty acids are rapidly absorbed in the intestines while long chain fatty acids required pancreatic lipase enzyme for absorption. They eventually reach the liver where they either undergo beta oxidation, production to cholesterol, or are repackaged as triglycerides. But short and medium chain fatty acids are rapidly oxidized to energy. Unlike long chain fatty acids, medium and short chain fatty acids do not enter the cholesterol cycle and they aren?t deposited in fat depots.? ?
3. Antimicrobial activity
Nearly half of the coconut oil?s fatty acids are lauric acid, a source of monolaurine which has antiviral, antibacterial (particularly against to Vibrio cholerae, Salmonella typhi, Shigella sonnei and Escherichia coli) and antiprotozoal properties. Monolaurine can destroy lipid-coated viruses including influenza viruses. Coconut oil can also boost a weakened immune system by enhancing white blood cell counts which help the body to directly fight against viruses.? ?
4. Antioxidant activity
The antioxidant capacity of coconut oil is due to the presence of phenolic substances and it depends on the coconut extraction method. According to some research studies, virgin coconut oil, which is produced through chilling and fermentation, have a better antioxidant capacity compared to refined bleached and deodorized (RBD) coconut oil. This is because natural phenolic antioxidants are removed during the refining and bleaching steps. Moreover, few studies have proved that the presence of antioxidants in coconut oil is stable at high cooking temperatures and their activities remain even at 120 0C.? ?
5. Anticancer activity
Studies have shown that there is an ability in coconut oil to inhibit cancer agents in the colon and in mammary tumors (in breast) due to the presence of saturated fatty acids mainly lauric acid which is more protective than unsaturated oil.? ?
6. Improves memory and brain function
Our brain cells depend on mitochondria which generates energy through glucose metabolism. This energy is required for brain functions. Alzheimer?s disease is a progressive disease that destroys memory and other significant mental functions, during which mitochondria becomes less able to absorb and use glucose and eventually it affects the glucose metabolism. A number of research studies have discovered that the intake of coconut oil improves mental skills. Medium chain triglycerides directly enter the liver and produce the ketones by breaking down of medium chain triglycerides. Then these ketones are transported to the brain through the blood stream. When glucose metabolism fails, these ketones can act as an alternate fuel. Moreover, there is a belief that ketones may help restore and renew neurons in the brain.? ?
7. Improves serum cholesterol?
A number of studies conducted by using animals have reported that the consumption of coconut oil may increase serum HDL cholesterol (good cholesterol) level and reduce the total cholesterol, triglyceride and LDL (bad) cholesterol levels due to action of polyphenols and vitamin E in coconut oil. Besides, saturated fat also plays a role in the improvement of HDL cholesterol.?
?
8. Preserve insulin action
Insulin resistance is an impaired ability of insulin to regulate carbohydrate and lipid metabolism in target tissues while it is closely linked with excess lipid deposition in non-adipose tissues such as skeletal muscle and liver. This insulin resistance is one of the major metabolic defects of obesity and type 2 diabetes. According to some experiments on animals, medium chain fatty acids preserve insulin action in muscle and adipose.? ?
9. Boosting thyroid function
Unsaturated fatty acids change the hormones while it can damage thyroid hormones which cause to block thyroid hormone secretion. Therefore, refined unsaturated vegetable oils suppress the thyroid function and can cause weight gain. But coconut oil is not rich in unsaturated fatty acids. Therefore, coconut oil doesn?t make negative effects on thyroid function while it helps the thyroid gland to function normally.? ?
10. Improve the health of skin and hair?
Virgin coconut oil is very popular as a therapeutic moisturizer for mild to moderate dry skin in soap industry and other beauty care products. And also, coconut oil has skin antiseptic effects. Therefore, coconut oil has formulated into cream to retain antimicrobial activity of coconut oil. In addition, virgin coconut oil extracted by cold wet methods contains higher amounts of vitamin E and A. Therefore, coconut oil has been used as a popular ingredient in many skin care and hair care products due to its moisturizing effect, vitamin E and A content, and antimicrobial activity.? ?
?
Coronary heart disease and?coconut oil
During past few years, people believed that coconut oil has a significant influence on coronary heart disease since it is rich in saturated fatty acids. It is a common opinion that saturated fat is bad for health and it increases cholesterol levels in blood. However, when considering health effects of saturated fat, it is also important to consider the chain lengths of fatty acids since its metabolic pathways depend on the chain length. Results of some research publications indicate that shorter chain fatty acids oxidizes more easily instead of entering the fat deposits compared to longer chain fatty acids. In addition, coconut oil contains a lipid fraction and non- lipid fraction. Of these two fractions, lipid fraction is a highly important fraction in occurrence of heart diseases.? ?
Elevated levels of circulating low-density lipoprotein (LDL), which are rich in cholesterol and cholesterol esters, are risk factors for developing coronary heart disease. Because, gradual deposition of cholesterol inside the arteries cause to reduces the blood flow to the heart muscle and result in a heart attack. However, a few of animal based experimental studies showed that coconut oil doesn?t contribute to coronary heart disease due to coconut oil?s increased level of HDL cholesterol (good cholesterol) and decreased level of LDL cholesterol (bad cholesterol), triglycerides and total cholesterol.? ?
Moreover, oxidized low density lipoproteins play critical role in the deposition of cholesterol-laden cells into the arterial wall while adequate evidence suggests that inhibition of the oxidation of LDL may reduce the risk of heart disease. Consumption of coconut oil may help to inhibit the LDL oxidation because coconut oil is rich in several phenolic substances which show antioxidant properties. As a result of that there are growing evidence from epidemiological and controlled studies that correlates a high intake of antioxidants with a lower incidence of CHD.? ?
In conclusion, coconut oil has lots of health benefits while those aspects are based on the fatty acid composition of coconut oil. However, the fatty acid composition of coconut oil does not significantly vary with extraction method. Among different types of coconut oils in our local market, virgin coconut oil provides better beneficial effect on our health compared to other types of coconut oil. Moreover, according to the fatty acid composition of coconut oil, it has only a minimum trend to produce the trans fats which has adverse effect on development of cardiovascular diseases. The reason is that, coconut oil is not rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids compared with other vegetable oils. However, coconut oil contains only 1-2 % of essential fatty acid. Therefore coconut oil is not a good source of essential fatty acids.? ?

New law to disclose conflict of interests and relationships
	
The Bribery Commission is to give more teeth to the penal code soon by introducing a new law to 'Disclose Conflict of Interests and Relationships' which will filter the roles of all law enforcement agencies, the judiciary and politicians in a bid to curb corruption and nepotism.
The Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption (CIABOC) will draft the new act to bring the law into effect keeping in line with the treaty of United Nations Convention against Corruption (UNCAC), signed in December 2003.
One of the Commissioners of CIABOC Neville Guruge told the Daily Mirror that so far there were no provisions in the Sri Lankan legal system to take action against instances of conflict of interests and nepotism that arise while performing duties in the state sector and law enforcement agencies.
The law would be pertinent to all law enforcement agencies that conduct probes and to disclose if the probing subject or the suspect has any acquaintance to the investigator that would lead to an instance of conflict of interest.
Not only agencies but this would be applicable to judges in the judiciary when a case of a known person is being heard or dealt with and the government officers in making decisions with regards to acquainted parties.
Another very serious instance the law would be applicable to is on politicians making favorations to their kith and kin in getting various services rendered such as approving contracts and granting jobs.
He said the authorities or public representatives should disclose instances of conflict of interests or relationships, which was considered as an ethical matter all this while and not a legal violation, since there was no laws to act on.
Although many developed countries practise this law of disclosing instances of conflict of interests on ethical grounds or to challenge perpetrators with the law, in Sri Lanka nothing could be done more than conducting a mere departmental inquiry on such an instance if found guilty of conflict of interests.
The Commissioner said therefore, the new law should provide for the disclosure of conflict of interest of all public officers and public representatives.
A special five day programme was held since Monday with the participation of the senior representatives of the Bribery Commission, Attorney General?s Department, the Legal Draftsman, Auditor General?s Department, Elections Commission, foreign experts like United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), World Bank Group partnership programme Stolen Assets Recovery Initiative (StAR) and Transparency International.
The first two days of the programme was held to gather ideas from all spheres of the society including various civil society organisations whilst the remaining three days the BC would sit down with the Legal Draftsman?s Department, Attorney General to discuss further on how to drat the new law.

New rules restricting fag sales rattle tobacco retailers
	
The Tobacco Retailers? Association yesterday voiced opposition against the government?s intentions to ban the sale of cigarettes at outlets within 100 metres of schools and places of religious worship, since such a move would drive most eateries and shops out of business.
?Our members have said that they would lose 50 percent of their sales if the government goes ahead with this decision,? Tobacco Retailers? Association Secretary Nilantha Costa said at a media briefing held in Colombo yesterday. He said that? the fall in revenue would not come from the shops not being able to sell cigarettes, since the shops now gain a margin of 2 percent on a cigarette, compared to 15 percent previously, owing to the tax increases, which came into effect late 2016.
?It?s not the revenue we get from selling cigarettes. When a customer usually comes to our shops for tea or to have a meal, they prefer to have a cigarette as well. If we can?t sell cigarettes, these customers would stop frequenting such eateries or shops and we can?t sell our other products,? Costa said.
He claimed that of the 7,500 eateries, tea shops, supermarkets and grocery stores of varying sizes, which are members of the association, over 95 percent are situated within 100 metres from schools and places of religious worship. Nationally, tobacco retailers total 125,000 he said.
Costa guaranteed that the members of the Tobacco Retailers? Association do not sell cigarettes to minors or allow cigarettes to be smoked within a shop, as prohibited by law.
?We would know if we are inducing the minors to smoke because then the public health inspectors would catch us and close down our shops. We also have children so we wouldn?t sell to other children. If schoolchildren want to buy cigarettes, they won?t come to our shops. They will go to shops farther away, which would sell to them,? Costa said.
He said that if the government wants to drive down the consumption of tobacco among minors, they would go after such errant retailers and those selling smuggled cigarettes and beedi.
Meanwhile, Tobacco Retailers? Association Deputy Secretary Jagath Hennayake added that the government also aims to limit cigarette sales to purchase of an entire packet, instead of the current practice, where most smokers purchase one or two cigarettes for immediate consumption.
?How many customers would actually spend Rs.600 for an entire packet?? he questioned.
The government has been attempting to collect higher revenue and curtail tobacco use in Sri Lanka by raising taxes and introducing other policies, which also include the depiction of picture warnings on cigarette packets and ban of tobacco farming in Sri Lanka by 2020.
Analysts have criticized the move to raise taxes, saying that the residents would move towards the unregulated, cheap beedi products or smuggled cigarettes, which pay no duty and the sales of these substitutes have skyrocketed since 2016.
Tobacco farmers have also accused politicians of corruption, saying that the politicians are eyeing hefty commissions through allowing more imported tobacco leaves and weakening the local leaf supply.
However, the government?s other aim of generating revenue for the Treasury was a success, with the country?s only cigarette manufacturer, Ceylon Tobacco Company PLC, contributing Rs.117.4 billion in excise taxes, levies and income tax in 2017, up from Rs.98.4 billion in 2016.

Policies to regulate social media must strike a balance: HRC
	
Freedom of expression and the right to information must be balanced in any future policy regarding the regulation of social media to deal with hate speech within the legal limits, the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka (HRCSL) said yesterday.
Dr Deepika Udagama, the Chairperson of the HRCSL said the legal limits, within which freedom of expression and the Right to Information should be restricted, must be within the Constitution and Sri Lanka's international human rights obligations in the larger public interest.
In a letter sent to the Chairman of the Telecommunication Regulatory Commission (TRCSL) Chairman Austin Fernando on Thursday, she said the HRCSL had received several complaints from the public regarding the continued restrictions on social media even after the violence in the Kandy District was under control.
?The Commission recognizes the critical necessity to protect freedom of expression and the right to information as guaranteed by the Constitution of Sri Lanka and Sri Lanka's international human rights obligations,? the letter said.
?ln doing so, we recognize the need to strike the necessary balance between those rights and maintenance of public order and the protection of the rights of all,? it said.
Further, the HRCSL had reiterated the urgent need to take legal action against those who were using social media to propagate communal hatred and incite sectarian violence, under applicable laws, in particular under the ICCPR Act No. 56 of 2007.
The ban on social media was removed by the Government during the week.
Discussions are also being held with telecommunication authorities including officials from Facebook Inc. who arrived in the country yesterday.
However, it is also learnt that regulating social media posts in local languages was a challenge for the officials at the TRCSL. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

Prov. Councillor started brawl: Preliminary investigation reveals
	
According to the preliminary investigation that was held into an incident where a Provincial Councillor and his wife were seen allegedly assaulting a private bus driver, it was found that Southern Provincial Councillor M. K. Kasun had started the brawl with the private bus driver, Investigation officer Thalangama Police OIC Arjun Mahimkanda said yesterday.
When contacted, he said their investigations had revealed that the Provincial Councillor had obstructed the bus plying on route number 177 from Kaduwela to Kollupitiya and started the brawl when the private bus driver asked him to stop obstructing him from doing his duties.
The incident had taken place on Friday (9) at the Koswatta Junction in Battaramulla.
Investigations had revealed that the two vehicles were racing against each other when the altercation took place.
OIC Mahimkanda said the Provincial Councillor?s wife Tharaka Perera had joined her husband in assaulting the driver while brandishing a pistol to keep away the passengers who were at the scene.
Although video footage of the brawl, said to have been uploaded by passengers,went viral on social media, the OIC said the video footage was blurry and therefore requested the shops nearby to provide them with CCTV footage of the incident for which a Court order had been received but said they were yet to receive a response.
OIC Mahimkanda said there were complaints that the driver of the bus did not possess a driving license, but confirmed that their investigations had revealed that he was an experienced driver with all the required paperwork including license and registration. He further said that just because a driver does not possess a licence and registration it does not have any bearing on the issue at hand which was the brawl that had taken place between two parties.
He said the passenger bus was owned by a person with the alias 'Suda' who is now in remand custody for a criminal offence.
It was revealed that M. K. Kasun represents the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) and is the son of late Southern PC member M. K. Ranjith, AKA Chandi Malli, who was a close supporter of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa. Chandi Malli was shot dead in front of the Bank of Ceylon York Street branch on May 25, 2003.
OIC Mahimkanda said that the councillor had a record of violent behaviour.
Investigations had also revealed that the revolver used during the altercation was registered to Provincial Councillor M. K. Kasun but its license had expired as it had not been renewed for the current year.
Police said though the revolver was not fired only five bullets were left in the cylinder when it was taken into police custody as it was a common practice to keep one chamber empty as there is no safety lock in the revolver.
Meanwhile, Southern Provincial Council Chief Government Whip Ajith Rajapakse stressed the need to detail police or security personnel to provide protection to PC members in view of the recent incident where provincial councillor M. K. Kasun?s wife had been forced to come to his rescue when he was assaulted by a private bus driver. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

Read your fortune by the yogas formed on your palm
	
?
Although Astrology (Jyotish Shastra), Palmistry (Hasta Rekha Shastra) and Numerology have developed as separate subjects or sciences in recent times, the latter two sciences had developed as part or branches of Astrology in ancient times. In fact, Numerology had developed as `Swara Shastra? which suggests that the ancient sages in India in particular had laid more emphasis on the vibrational or phonetic aspect of the science than on the numerical aspect.
?
Palmistry and Numerology ? Offshoots from Astrology
Both Palmistry and Numerology ? the modern day `Swara Shastra, concede the influence of planets on man. For example, in Palmistry the Mounts and Lines on the hand are named after planets. And the characteristics of different planets are taken into account in reading the significations of the Lines, Mounts and signs on them. In Numerology too in interpreting the values of numbers, colours, gemstones, etc. planetary influence is taken into account. Therefore, nomenclature or terminology occurring Astrology is widely used in Palmistry and Numerology as well.
?
The same Yogas giving same results
Certain favourable and unfavourable planetary combinations are termed as Yogas in Astrology. Astrology also speaks of favourable Yogas like Amala, Anapha, Adhi and Vesi and unfavourable ones like Daridra and Papakartari. Some of our readers might be surprised to learn that Yogas by the same names giving results similar to those described in Astrology occur in Palmistry?
as well.
We hope to discuss some of such favourable and unfavourable Yogas occurring in Palmistry.

Social factors, complex lifestyle decrease fertility: Study
	
A group of medical professionals yesterday said the fertility of men in the country was currently decreasing because of several reasons including the complex lifestyle of the people.
Consultant Obstetrician and Gynaecologist Dr. Lakshman Senanayake told a news conference that the other reasons behind the increase in infertility and sub-fertility of men were due to smoking, alcoholic and narcotic addiction.
?The decrease in fertility of men is not a result of any medicine. It all depends on the lifestyle and the current background of the people,? he said.
Meanwhile, Professor in Reproductive Medicine Chandrika Wijeyaratne said even the fertility in women was also decreasing in present context due to the passing of ideal age for reproduction as a result of social factors.
?Another reason for the decrease in fertility of women is the obesity,? she said.
She also said the sub fertility of men was around 15% a decade ago and added that however there was a rapid increase in it at present. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)

Taking a close look at  cirrhosis
	
?
Patients with a variety of medical disorders consult General (Internal) Physicians with various symptoms and signs. Swelling of legs is a very common symptom and a sign observed in clinical practice. A large number of conditions can cause swelling in the legs. Common causes of swelling in the legs are cirrhosis (chronic liver cell disease), chronic kidney disease, congestive heart failure, hypothyroidism, nephrotic syndrome and malnutrition. In some patients it?s not possible to find a definitive cause.? ?
Cirrhosis is a common cause for swelling in the legs. Cirrhosis is a very common condition and is the fourteenth most common cause of death globally. In Europe cirrhosis is the 4th most common cause of death. At the time of the presentation to clinicians, most patients are in the advanced stage of the disease. Many patients die from this disease in their fifth or sixth decade of life.? ?
Cirrhosis can be caused by a large of number of conditions. Globally alcoholic liver disease is considered to be the most common cause of cirrhosis. Cirrhosis is increasingly seen in people who have never taken alcohol in their life. This condition is commonly known as non alcoholic cirrhosis. There are a large number of conditions known to cause non alcoholic cirrhosis.??
?
Definition?
Cirrhosis represents a late stage of progressive hepatic fibrosis with distortion of the hepatic architecture and the formation of regenerative nodules. It is irreversible in its advanced stages and needs liver transplantation as the treatment.??
?
What are the signs and symptoms?
Cirrhosis often has no signs or symptoms until liver damage is extensive. When signs and symptoms do occur, they may include:??
?
Fatigue??
	Loss of appetite??
	Nausea and vomiting??
	Easy bruising? ?
	Fluid accumulation in the abdomen??
	Swelling of legs??
	Darkening of skin??
	Yellowish discoloration of body??
	Itching of skin??
	Confusion, drowsiness and slurred speech? ?
	Spiderlike blood vessels on your skin??
	Redness in the palms of the hand??
	Testicle size become small in men??
	Breast enlargement in men??
?
What are the causes of non alcoholic cirrhosis?
Chronic viral hepatitis (hepatitis B, C)??
	Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease??
	Hemochromatosis??
	Medications (eg, methotrexate, isoniazid)??
	Autoimmune hepatitis??
	Wilson disease??
	Primary and secondary biliary cirrhosis??
	Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency??
	Idiopathic portal fibrosis??
?
How is cirrhosis diagnosed?
In the advanced stage, with symptoms and signs mentioned above, cirrhosis can be diagnosed clinically.??
In early stage of the disease and to confirm the diagnosis following investigations are needed.??
Aminotransferases ? Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) are usually moderately elevated in patients with cirrhosis.??
Bilirubin ? Bilirubin levels may be normal in well-compensated cirrhosis. However, they rise as the cirrhosis progresses.??
Albumin ? Albumin is synthesized exclusively in the liver. Albumin levels fall as the synthetic function of the liver declines with worsening cirrhosis. Thus, serum albumin levels can be used to help grade the severity of cirrhosis.??
Prothrombin time - The prothrombin time increases as the ability of a cirrhotic liver to synthesize clotting factors diminishes.? ?
Alkaline phosphatase ? Alkaline phosphatase is usually elevated in the setting of cirrhosis, but is less than two to three times the upper normal limit.?
Platelet count ? A low platelet count (thrombocytopenia) is common. Thrombocytopenia is mainly caused by portal hypertension with attendant congestive splenomegaly.??
Haemoglobin level ? A low haemoglobin level (anaemia) is usually multifactorial in origin; acute and chronic gastrointestinal blood loss, folate deficiency, direct toxicity due to alcohol.??
Ultrasound Scan ? Ultrasound Scan is routinely used during the evaluation of cirrhosis. It is noninvasive, well tolerated, widely available, and provides valuable information. In advanced cirrhosis, the liver may appear small and nodular. Surface nodularity and increased echogenicity with irregular appearing areas are consistent with cirrhosis.??
Liver biopsy ? The gold standard for diagnosing cirrhosis is examination of an explanted liver, either at autopsy or following liver transplantation, because the architecture of the entire liver can be appreciated. In clinical practice liver biopsy is performed to see the liver histology. However, liver biopsy is not necessary if the clinical, laboratory, and radiologic data strongly suggest the presence of cirrhosis and if the results would not alter the patient?s management.??
What are the complications of cirrhosis?
Fluid accumulation in the abdomen (ascites)??
	Vomiting of blood and passing of black coloured stools.??
	Confusion, drowsiness and slurred speech (hepatic encephalopathy).??
	Infection of the fluid in the abdomen.??
	Impairment of kidney function.??
	Development of carcinoma.? ?
	Impairment of immune function leading to infections.? ?
?
How to treat cirrhosis?
The goals of treatment are to slow the progression of scar tissue in the liver and to prevent or treat symptoms and complications of cirrhosis. If diagnosed early it may be possible to minimize damage to the liver by treating the underlying cause.? ?
?
Treatment for alcohol dependency
?People with cirrhosis caused by alcohol abuse should stop drinking.? ?
?It is essential to stop drinking since any amount of alcohol is toxic to the liver.??
?
?
Weight loss
People with cirrhosis caused by nonalcoholic fatty liver disease may become healthier if they lose weight and control their blood sugar levels.??
?
Discontinuation of drugs
If cirrhosis is caused by some drugs, they should be discontinued immediately.??
Medications to control hepatitis
Medications may limit further damage to liver cells caused by hepatitis B or C through specific treatment of these viruses.??
Specific treatment of the underlying condition
If cirrhosis is due to a condition like Wilson?s disease , treating this condition with specific drugs may retard the progression??
Excess fluid in your body
A low-sodium diet and medication to prevent fluid buildup in the body may help control fluid in the abdomen (ascites) and swelling??
Portal hypertension
Certain blood pressure medications may control increased pressure in the veins that supply the liver (portal hypertension) and prevent severe bleeding.??
Infections
Treating infections with appropriate drugs may prevent further damage.??
Prevention and treatment of acute deterioration of liver function
Acute deterioration of liver function could be prevented by treating constipation, avoiding liver toxic drugs, controlling the increased pressure in the veins supplying the liver and treating infections??
In advanced cases of cirrhosis, when the liver ceases to function, a liver transplant may be the only treatment option.??

The granddaughter?s gaze
	
It?s just past noon on a Saturday. I am leaning against a half wall at one end of a long hall. At the other end, on the wall, hangs a portrait. On the floor there are around 75 students. All eager to learn how to dance or in some case the finer points of the art. There are four teachers and a couple of assistants, probably senior students or members of the dance company. Two of the teachers have drums. There?s that drumming and the drumming of feet. Admonishment and encouragement.
? ?I let my eyes stroll from one end of the dance hall to the other and it?s a blur of red and black that I see. The play of drum and feet, the synchrony (more or less) of sets of students following instructions all fade out and I focus?on the teachers.? ?
In April there will be a special performance by students under seven years of age. In June, there will be a grand three-day exposure, ?Guru Gedara?
At one end Upekha with a drum, unforgiving, looking out for the slightest misstep or sign of negligence or sloth; she?s training the senior students, those who had the potential to join the Chitrasena-Vajira Dance Company.? ?
In the next section of the hall Thaji, her niece and the principal dancer of the Company, is handling 7-8 year old kids. She?s strict too but kind. Maybe she wants them to love dancing and is teaching them that there are no shortcuts to love.? ?
Then there?s Anjalika, Upekha?s sister. There?s a group of older kids, 13-15 years of age. Yes, she?s firm too. They all seem to be. Maybe they have to be.? ?
All three are totally focused. Their commitment to the matter of nurturing, teaching and perfecting is absolute. I can?t see what?s happening at the other end of the hall, so I walk around the building so I can get a better view.? ?
And there she was. Vajira. She was overseeing the scholarship students of the Academy. They had to go through what was obviously a gruelling set of exercises. She didn?t speak much. She watched. It was as though gaze was voice enough.? ?
She was sitting on a bench against the wall. Above her hung the portrait of her late husband, the legendary Chitrasena. At first glance it?s as if he?s looking askance, almost ignoring what?s happening just below in that long dance hall. I felt, though, that he was looking beyond it all, at places he?s been or is at or where those below should one day go.? ?
By and by the sound of drums and feet abates. The classes are done. Most of the kids are taken away by their parents, some of the senior students remain for the afternoon session. The teachers have a meeting, the students have lunch.? ?
Vajira, who will turn 86 on March 15, will be a part of it all.? After all, she?s been a part of that history. The dance never stops and therefore the work never stops??
Vajira is not feeling too well, so she?s quiet. She talked enough. Done enough. The dance company is celebrating its 75th year right now and the dance school will reach that mark next year. They have lots of plans for the year.? ?
In April there will be a special performance by students under seven years of age. In June, there will be a grand three-day exposure, ?Guru Gedara?. The name refers of course to a residential facility to be built in the premises of the Chitrasena Kalayathanaya. The event will showcase all arts and crafts associated with dance. It would be a one-stop affair where visitors would get a flavour of everything that comes together to produce the splendid performances that the company is known to produce. It will all culminate in performances by the company and the students. A treat to look forward to, certainly. This special year is to culminate in the production of one of?Chitrasena?s ballets.? ?
Vajira, who will turn 86 on March 15, will be a part of it all. And rightly so. After all, she?s been a part of that history. Long enough, one might say, but she would probably disagree. The dance never stops and therefore the work never stops.? ?
Every Saturday she takes two classes. There?s one for adult students who began in January and another fitness/dance programme for 20-15 students who are beneficiaries of scholarships granted by the Chitrasena-Vajira Dance Foundation. There are over 250 students altogether, but obviously she doesn?t handle all of them. However, she has a fitness class every Monday which is open to anyone.? ?
?It?s a seven-class programme that?s based on Kandyan dancing,? her granddaughter Thaji explained.?
I learned from her only when I was about seven. She taught me Kandyan dancing. Later my aunts Anjalika and Upekkha taught me. Archchi was very strict. In fact we were terrified?
?
?This is a set of exercises she developed in the early 1990s. It was actually something she developed for herself because it helped her in her dancing. It is a complete workout, from head to toes and between these the eyes, jaws, face, arms, hands, fingers, stomach etc.?? ?
Thaji has seen it all. She practically grew up with Vajira and learned at her feet, literally and metaphorically, and not just about dance.? ? ?She lived with us and took care of us. She would want to feed me, but I was a poor eater. I gave her a really hard time, making her run around the table.?? ?
And of course, like everyone in the clan, she taught Thaji?how to dance.? ?
?I learned from her only when I was about seven. She taught me Kandyan dancing. Later my aunts Anjalika and Upekkha taught me. Achchi was very strict. In fact we were terrified of her. She is still strict, she hasn?t?changed much!? ?
?I remember she would make us dance the same step for half an hour. We had to do it until we got it right. We were just 7-8 year old in that class. We were naturally playful. I didn?t mind. The other kids in the class were going ?oh god?!? but I loved it. I was fully engrossed in it all from the age of 6 or so.?? ?
For her, Vajira was and is the loving, caring and nurturing grandmother. Vajira, being who she is as teacher and grandmother, taught her much.? ?
?I?ve learned so much from her. If I were to pin it down to one single thing, it?s discipline. She?s disciplined in everything she does, when it comes to dance and when it comes to day to day things; the way she keeps everything neat and tidy, the way she folds and keeps her clothes, takes care of her belongings. Not just her personal belongings, but how she preserves even the costumes. We still have costumes from the 1940s simply because of the way Achchi stored, preserved and took care of them.? ?
?She?s always been very particular about her eating habits. She is conscious of such things. She never overeats, but she loves her sweets. There?s always a piece of? chocolate after meals, but then again, it?s always in moderation.?? ?
Thaji believes that she gets her discipline from her grandmother. Discipline when it comes to dancing and teaching, that is.? ?
?Order is something I would love to have in my daily life, but it is very difficult, but when it comes to dancing and teaching I don?t compromise,? she said.? ? And determination, she adds. Maybe that?s part of the discipline, the no-compromise, no-short cuts kind of attitude, the resolve to treat the vicissitudes of life with equanimity, to treat the art with devotion and pay tribute in the form of relentless and unforgiving training that is as much part of the dance as the performance itself. These Thaji has learned, mostly from Vajira, one feels.? ?And now?? ?Thaji smiles.? ?
?I want to give as much as possible to her what she gave to me. I want to take care of her to the best as I could. It?s as if the roles have reversed.?? ?
She smiles again. It?s quiet in the dance hall. A young woman who is grandchild and standard-bearer of a rich tradition has, in a few words, has just finished talking about a grandmother she adores and respects.? ?
The interview is done. I?ve taken down my notes. As I leave, people and images get erased, there?s no memory of drums and feet. There were colours but they are not important. All I remember are the words that Thaji said at the end of the class, words duly repeated by her students: ?Apa guru deguru niduk vethva, nirogi vethva, suvapath vethva?(May our parents and teachers be free of sorrow, may they be healthy?and at peace).? ?
What a blessing it is to be thus blessed almost everyday of the year by so many and especially a granddaughter who with love and veneration walks the path you?ve made simply by dancing and dancing and dancing.? ? Vajira turned 86. There must be fulfilment. And peace.? ? ?

## Title: Timing of landmark events in life

Timing of landmark events in life
	
?
When will I be able to marry? When will I be able to secure a permanent job? When Will I be able to move into a house of my own? When will I have the bliss of a child?
These are some of the commonplace questions that most people would ask an astrologer. We all have an insatiable curiosity and a desire to know what our future holds in store for us; to know in particular as to when certain landmark events in life we look forward to, are likely to occur. Therefore, timing of events has become an important part of Predictive Astrology.
A difficult task
In fact, timing of events is a more difficult and complicated task for an astrologer than delineating one?s character or assessing one?s potential -inherent power in a human being.
Timing of events is a task that calls for a correct assessment of the effects that the planets produce and an accurate determination as to when such effects materialize.
Astrologers rely on Dasas and concur rent transits of planets for predicting the times when the planets produce good or bad effects.
When a Dasa and a Bhukti (Antar Dasa) ruled by benefic planets are in operation, the native would? enjoy comforts, luxuries, power and privileges and high status. When the periods ruled by malefics or evil planets are in operation, the native would experience hardship, suffering and misery. According to Indian Rishis, there are certain planetary combinations that produce Dhanayoga and Rajayoga which fructify during the Dasas of the planets involved in producing such favourable combinations. The 5th and the 9th Bhavas provide the clues to determine the fortune of a person. The 4th and the 10th Bhavas determine the happiness and the comforts in store for the native. The lords of the 4th, 5th, 9th and 10th Bhavas always produce good results during the Dasas and Bhuktis they rule.?
?
Career success?
A good job or a rise in career can be looked forward to in the Dasas of the 9th and 10th lords or those of the benefic planets occupying the 9th and 10th Bhavas at birth. When all the benefics are posited in the 3rd, 6th, 10th and the 11th Houses from the Ascendant or the Moon, a powerful Dhanayoga is produced and the results of this yoga would materialize during the Dasas of the lords of these Houses or those of their occupants.?
?
Timing of marriage?
A careful study of the 7th, 2nd and the 5th Houses, the position of Venus and the 7th House from Venus is imperative for determining all matters relating to marriage. The Karakas or significators for marriage are the Moon, Mercury, and Jupiter. These planets play an important role in timing of marriage.?
Marriage can take place in the Dasas of the planets in the 7th or of the 7th lord or of the planets aspecting the 7th or 2nd lord during the Bhuktis of these planets.?
?
Transits
When the Lagnadhipati transits the 7th House, especially when Jupiter or Saturn is the lord of the Ascendant, there is the possibility for the marriage to take place. Marriage can take place when Jupiter transits the Rashi occupied by Venus or the 5th or the 9th House from Venus. Jupiter passing through the 5th or the 9th from the 7th or the Rashi occupied by the Moon also signifies the possibility of marriage?
?
Sadesati or Shani Erashtaka
?Even the good results due in the Dasa periods of benefics can become ineffective when such periods coincide with a Shani Erashtaka. This holds good for combinations pointing to marital happiness as well.

The court fixed the matter to be taken for support on May 14.
Meanwhile, Justice Priyantha Jayawardane had sought the opinion of the Parties whether they had any objection to him to hear the case as he knew both parties.The Counsel for the Bribery Commission on that instance had informed the Court that he had to obtain instruction.
The Petitions were filed by Justice Nawaz, Bar Association of Sri Lanka and Kalyana Thiranagama seeking to quash the decision of the Bribery Commission to institute proceedings against former Chief Justice Mohan Peiris and Justice A.H.M.D.Nawaz in the Magistrate?s Court of Colombo and/or to continue with the proceedings.
Gamini Marapana PC with Nigel Hatch PC, Dr Harsha Cabraal PC, Palitha Kumarasinghe PC and Navin Marapana appeared for Mohan Peiris. K. Kanag Iswaran PC appeared for Justice Nawaz. Romesh de Silva PC with Sugath Caldera and Manjula Pernandopulle and Niran Anketell appeared for the BASL. Jeffry Alagaratnam PC and M.A.Sumanthiran appeared for the Bribery Commission. Additional Solicitor General Sanjay Rajaratnam appeared for the Attorney General.
Court had on February 26 issued an Interim Order until final determination staying the proceedings in the Colombo Magistrate?s Court against former Chief Justice and Justice Nawaz initiated by Bribery Commission.
BASL in its petition stated the gravamen (the essence or most serious part of the complaint or accusation) of the purported allegation is that 1st Respondent Nawaz provided a legal opinion as a Deputy Solicitor General in December 2010 to confer a wrongful or unlawful benefit or advantage on another person or knowing that the said legal opinion would cause a wrongful or unlawful benefit or advantage to another person.
It contends the correctness or otherwise of a legal opinion is not within the purview and/or jurisdiction of the Magistrate and is thus not a matter into which a Magistrate could inquire.
It states that ex facie no wrongful or unlawful benefit could have been caused to any person such certain undisclosed Directors of the Lanka Electricity Company Pvt Ltd and some other persons in that the decision to prosecute is in the hands of those responsible for the prosecution who are not bound by an opinion of the Attorney General.
It emphasizes the 1st Respondent is thus entitled to all his privilege and immunity in respect of such professional work carried out.
It laments the actions of the Director General of Bribery Commission are misconceived to seek to impose any personal criminal liability upon the 1st Respondent?s acts done ex officio on behalf of the Attorney General.
It points out that 1st Respondent?s appointment as the Judge of the Court of Appeal in 2014 was approved by the Parliamentary Council without the slightest allegation of wrongdoing.
It bemoans his actions amount to an abuse of the Bribery Act and the Bribery Commission and corruption Act is ultra vires (beyond legal power or authority) the said Act. (S.S.Selvanayagam)

Uni. non-academic staff strike to continue
	
The work stoppage carried by the University Non-Academic staff would continue as the discussion held with Prime Minister?s Office ended without a solution this afternoon, University Trade Union Joint Committee said.
Speaking to the Daily Mirror, Chairman of the University Trade Union Joint Committee, Edward Malwattage said Prime Minister?s Coordinating Secretary Dadallage failed to provide a satisfactory solution to the issue.
He said the union had no interest in attending any more discussions and it would continue its trade union action until their demands were granted.
Operations across 15 State universities and higher education institutes, which come under the purview of the University Grants Commission, stalled for the 17th consecutive day inconveniencing undergraduates and academic staff of the institutions.
More than 15, 000 non-academic members support the trade union action launched on February 27 over several demands, including a solution to the monthly allowance, based on an agreement reached in 2016.
Meanwhile, in a communique, the University Grants Commission (UGC) urged the protesters to suspend their strike immediately and to continue the discussions over the demands. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

US hits Russia with sanctions for election meddling
	
?
Donald Trump?s administration on Thursday levied sanctions against Russia?s top spy agencies and more than a dozen individuals for trying to influence the 2016 US presidential election and conducting separate cyberattacks.? ?
The announcement follows a lengthy delay that had caused anger on Capitol Hill and raised questions about Trump?s willingness to confront Moscow.? ?
The measures target five entities and 19 individuals --including the FSB, Russia?s top spy service; the military intelligence agency, or GRU; and 13 people recently indicted by Robert Mueller, the US special counsel handling a sprawling Russia probe.? ?
Sanctions were also levied against individuals behind a separate Petya cyberattack and an ?ongoing? attempt to hack the US energy grid. ?The administration is confronting and countering malign Russian cyber activity, including their attempted interference in US elections, destructive cyber-attacks, and intrusions targeting critical infrastructure,? said Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.? ?
??These targeted sanctions are a part of a broader effort to address the ongoing nefarious attacks emanating from Russia.? Many of the main entities and individuals hit -- including the spy agencies and ?troll factory? boss Yevgeny Prigozhin -- already face assets freezes and travel bans, either put in place under Barack Obama?s administration or for actions linked to Russia?s actions in Ukraine.? ?
But the decision heaps pressure on Moscow as it faces separate punitive measures for an alleged attempt to kill a Russian-born British informant with a nerve agent west of London.? ?
