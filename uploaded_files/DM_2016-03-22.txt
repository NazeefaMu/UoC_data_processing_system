An LP Gas Power Plant against expert opinion
	

A yahapalanaya purohita hailing from a well-known political family in the West has set his heart on setting up an LP Gas power plant in the Hambantota harbour premises.

A close friend of this purohita is also closely associated with the latter in mooting this project.
Meanwhile, the proposed project has come in for flak from several experts. However, the purohita in question is determined to go ahead with the project undeterred by protests and opposition, they say.

Dial 1987 for CEB
	
The Ceylon Electricity Board had activated a new hotline (1987) in response to charges that the CEB emergency lines were out of order during a crisis, the Ceylon Electricity Board said yesterday.
Residents of Dehiwela and Mount Lavinia were doubly inconvenienced this week when calls to 0114418418, the number for Interruptions to Electricity Supply, went unanswered.
The calls, which were answered by a voice machine directed callers to check their trip switches and pay the electricity bills to avoid any inconvenience before disconnecting.
When the Daily Mirror contacted the CEB Western Province South One, Deputy General Manager Rohan Seneviratne denied possibilities of phone calls being unanswered.
There are three phone operators working on 14 lines and it was impossible to answer all calls that are made to us, he said.
But many of the callers hold on until our representative is free to come to their assistance or we call them back, he said.
However, Seneviratne said he would look into the matter and confirm there were no technical errors.
When contacted, CEB Chairman Anura Wijeypala said a number of public servants, who worked the night shift were not present at their posts or simply did not do their work properly.
We dont know what happened here but we have introduced a new hotline (1987) to ensure customers are able to contact us at any time, he said. (Yohan Perera)

Dry spell might trigger water scarcity: Met Dept.

A met Department spokesperson responding to a recent report that water levels of the Kelani river was going down, said the absence of inter monsoonal rains, and the change in the wind pattern had been some of the main causes for the dry weather while global warming could have had an indirect impact.
The Department confirmed that the temperature in Vavuniya, Jaffna, and Anuradhapura districts had increased by more than 4 degrees Centigrade than the usual figure while the temperature in other parts of the country had increased by 2C degrees.
The highest temperature of 37/9C degrees was recorded from Kurunegala while the temperature in Anuradhapura and Vavuniya also exceeded 37C. The temperature in Ratnapura, and Moneragala exceeded 36 degrees while the temperature in the rest of the island was more than 30C .
The Department predicted dry weather during the coming days as well.
However Director General Management of Water Projects Ranjith Perera said the supply of water in Colombo and greater Colombo had not been reduced. He said normal water supply could continue without any interruption as of now. (Yohan Perera)

Free gravy packet costs him months pay
	
This story about a driver who had been subjected to a major punishment for a minor offence comes from a hospital located in an area close to Colombo.

The driver in question is an employee of this hospital. Recently he had obtained a packet of gravy from the hospitals welfare canteen to eat a loaf of bread he brought with him.
A certain administrative authority who had learnt that this driver had got the gravy packet for free had ordered the cut of his entire pay for the ensuing month as punishment.
Employees who criticize in whispers the major penalty imposed for a minor wrong allege that the authority concerned cannot claim to have clean hands either for he is involved in embezzling an allocation of Rs.900, 000 made to the welfare society running the hospital canteen.

JVP to go to FCID against Uva CM
	
JVP Uva Provincial Councilor Samantha Vidyarathna had said he would lodge a complaint against Uva Chief Minister Chamara Sampath Dassanayake with the Financial Crimes Investigations Division (FCID) over several fraudulent acts committed by him within the council.
Claiming that he had evidence in his possession to incriminate the chief minister, PC Vidyarathna alleged that the chief minister had misused funds belonging to the council last November.
He said the chief minister had attempted to ask for forgiveness for his misdeeds from the Gods by dashing coconuts etc.
Speaking about this attempt by the CM to absolve himself from blame for his illegal activities, PC member Vidyarathna said he was better off going to court and at least trying to prove his innocence to a judge.
Two state banks have given more than Rs.5 million for a bag distribution ceremony to be held at the Council. We have got to know that the minister had not deposited them into the councils bank account. There were also some other projects carried out by the council to collect money for the bag distribution event. However, the minister had said he used the whole amount of money for the event, Vidyarathna said.
Coming up with more allegations, he alleged that the Chief Minister had arbitrarily withdrawn millions held in six fixed deposits belonging to the council from a state bank before the deposits had reached maturity.
The move has taken by the Chief Minister despite opposition shown by all the provincial councillors to the idea, he said.
He claimed the Chief Minister had withdrawn the money kept with the particular bank in retaliation for a decision made by the bank management not to give any money for the bag distribution event. (Piyumi Fonseka)

Lankan arrested in US over expired visa
	
The US border patrol agents on Sunday night had arrested a Sri Lankan man who failed to produce proper documentation or his passport, Palm Beach Daily News reported. 
Ingarathas Rajalingam, 26, was a passenger in a black 2001 Ford SUV that an officer stopped at 11:45 p.m. in the 200 block of Royal Palm Way because the vehicles window tint appeared too dark.
Rajalingam previously had been arrested in Houston for being in the country illegally under Section 212(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, according to the police report.
According to the report, the passenger and driver told police they were staying in Miami and were training to become pilots at Kendall-Tamiami Executive Airport in Miami.
Rajalingam said he was born in Sri Lanka but lived in France and arrived in the States in December.
Rajalingam told police he was stopped in Texas in the airport because his student visa was expired and he was not allowed in the country.
One of the two police officers making the stop noticed cut-up electrical wire in the trunk of the vehicle, strands of rope tied up neatly on the passenger seat and a panel that was removed from the drivers-side passenger floorboard, with exposed wires running from the front to the back of the vehicle.
Two border patrol agents arrived and arrested Rajalingam for failure to possess proper documentation or a passport.
The driver was given a warning by border patrol agents for having an expired residence card. Palm Beach Police issued the driver a citation for illegal front vehicle window tint.

No price increase on food items in canteens: COA
	
Although the price of a loaf of bread has been increased by the Bakery Owners Association, the prices of other items sold at canteens will not be increased, Canteen Owners Association (COA) National Organiser Asela Sampath said today.
The price of other food items sold in canteen wont be increased. It is unreasonable to increase the price of loaf of bread price by Rs.4.00, he said. Any price increase on a loaf of bread should be imposed by the government. In the alternative the government should grant some sort of relief to owners of Bakeries and Canteens.
Mr. Sampath said four loaves of bread each weighing 452 grammes could be produced with one kilo of wheat flour though unfortunately a loaf of bread made in most bakeries was not of the standard weight.
Without a standard weight in place it is unfair to impose a price increase of Rs.4.00. This leads to bakery owners earning an extra profit of R.9.00 on a loaf of bread, he said.
Mr. Sampath said, it was only proper for the price of a loaf of bread to be increased by Rs.2.50.
We are contemplating legal action against the bakery Owners Association over the increase in the bread prices and had requested the Consumer Affairs Authority (CAA) to implement a law compelling shops to have a weighing scale but this was never carried out. (Chaturanga Pradeep)

Prelates call for probe on Ven. Sobitha Thera's death
	
Alleging that the death of Ven. Maduluwawe Sobitha Thera who headed the Movement for a Just Society Head had not occurred due to natural causes, several well-known Buddhist monks yesterday requested for the appointment of a high powered commission to look into the matter.
The request was made by Ven. Muruttettuwe Ananda Thera, Ven. Elle Gunawansa Thera and Ven. Uduwe Dhammaloka Thera.
The Theras said they would also nominate a few neutral persons for such a commission if the government went ahead and appointed one.
Ven. Murutettuwe Ananda Thera said it was he who recommended doctors to late Sobitha Thera on whom he should consult.. The late Thera used to inform me about his illness in the past but did not do so during his last illness. Certain people admitted him to hospital. I visited him. He was discharged but was to go through some tests. Suddenly the of doctors who were treating him was changed. We were not informed of the treatment he was undergoing. When he was being treated his condition changed. We were suspicious. His condition worsened but was conscious. I was with him during his last hours, the Thera said.
Venerable Ananda Thera said the late Venerable Sobitha Thera told him that he was deceived by certain persons.  The late Thera would have been an enemy of the government had he lived, he said.
Ven. Elle Gunawansa Thera said there were some monks who died mysteriously after doing a great service to the nation. These he said included Venerable Gangodawilla Soma Thera and Ven. Panadure Ariyadamma Thera. We are still suspicious on their deaths as well., he said . Therefore the Ven. Thera called for the appointment of a high powered commission to probe the death of Venerable Sobitha Thera.
Ven.e Uduwe Dhammaloka Thera said they too could provide information if a commission was appointed. We accept that late Sobitha thera had some aliments but these did not affect his health and his health condition declined suddenly. (Yohan Perera)

Sharma rejects soft-pedalling HR abuses by MR regime
	
Outgoing Commonwealth Secretary General Kamalesh Sharma has rejected allegations of having soft-pedalled human rights abuses during the Rajapaksa regime, the Hindu reported on Tuesday.
Criticism of the Commonwealths role and Mr. Sharmas leadership peaked in the lead-up to CHOGM 2013 in Sri Lanka.
Human rights groups and pro-LTTE organisations in Britain accused him of soft-pedalling the human rights abuses of the Rajapaksa regime, which in turn led to some heads of government boycotting the meeting.
In an interview with the Hindu newspaper, Mr. Sharma had dismissed this criticism.
The most important point about the Commonwealth is that it engages with member states to advance the values template, he said.
I made five visits to Sri Lanka, but you cant keep on talking about it in public for the reason that work has to be done below the radar to carry political conviction. The results become visible at the end. He started the practice of issuing departure statements so that citizens were clear about why he had come and what he had achieved.
Mr. Sharma pointed to the present Sri Lankan governments appreciation of the role the Commonwealth played, and the practical steps taken in the form of round tables on reconciliation, and in training observers for the elections:
In the case of appointments to senior judicial offices, I spelt my disappointment very clearly, and we gave a compendium to the Rajapaksa government of best practices in the Commonwealth.
Challenges remain. There is still widespread resistence within several Commonwealth countries to the legalisation of gay rights and to correcting gender and religious inequalities. The terrain is very uneven, Mr. Sharma said. We can only urge that countries travel in the direction of our values.

Singaporean jailed for sham marriage to SL woman
	
A 36-year-old Singaporean man was jailed six months for entering into a sham marriage with a Sri Lankan national.
The man, Suresh Ananthan Chandran, was offered $4,000 by Dematagoda Kankanamalage Ayesha Rathnamalie, 23, to enter into a marriage of convenience with her, after they met in April 2013.
In return, Suresh would sponsor her visit pass applications to stay here so that she could eventually become a permanent resident.
Suresh agreed to this because he was facing financial difficulties. Ayesha then claimed she was unable to pay him the money and would, instead, help him to get the licence of a food stall called Curry Espresso. He agreed to the deal.
The marriage was solemnized on June 23, 2013. Ayesha then arranged for Suresh to sign an agreement to transfer Curry Espresso's food stall licence from the owner to him. She later left Singapore on July 28, 2013.
Then in November 2014, Suresh was arrested by the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA) for engaging in a marriage of convenience.
He was sentenced to six months jail on March 14.
The number of sham marriages in Singapore has dropped by 62 per cent from 170 in 2014 to 64 in 2015, according to figures released by ICA.
People who help with or sign a contract for a marriage of convenience can be fined up to $10,000 and jailed for up to 10 years. (straitstimes)

K. Dhayabararaj, a Sri Lankan Tamil refugee lodged at the Tiruchi special camp who is on an indefinite fast since Thursday, has alleged that his family is under illegal custody at the Special Quarantine Camp in Mandapam, Ramanathapuram district.
When contacted, his wife Udayakala claimed that she was suffering without money and food for her three little children and officials were not extending any help even as her health condition was deteriorating. The camp was closed to visitors and the family is held there for five months. However, police officers said the couple was facing a criminal charge in Sri Lanka and detained pending extradition process. There is no question of an illegal detentionwe have adopted the due process of law, a senior police officer, who preferred anonymity, said on Monday.
Speaking to The Hindu over phone from the camp, Mr. Dhayabararaj said his family was starving there. When they realised that their detention had no legality, they resorted to an indefinite fast to protest.
There is no case against me or any of my family members in India. After we landed by boat in May 2014, we were arrested by Q Branch police and booked for violation of the Passport Act. The court convicted and sentenced us to one year imprisonment. After completing the sentence, the police lodged me in Tiruchi prison and sent my family to the Special Quarantine Camp at Mandapam without any legal order, he alleged.

In a bid to unite the different factions of the SLFP, its senior members would urge President Maithripala Sirisena to solicit the support of former Defence Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa by offering him a key position, it is learnt.
A few senior members, including those holding Ministerial posts in the Government, have decided to advocate this idea, as a patch-up between the President and former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, which looks a distant possibility at the moment.
A senior member told the Daily Mirror on condition of anonymity that Gotabaya Rajapaksa, the former Presidents brother, sounded acceptable to both factions of the party and therefore he could be the best bet to hold the party united.
There is some resistance against some members of the Rajapaksa family. As far as we are concerned, there is no resistance against Gotabaya Rajapaksa, the member said.
He is admired by many over his role in ending the war and the development of urban areas, the senior member said.
The sources added that Gotabaya Rajapaksa could assist the President in pursuit of the countrys interests, if he were offered a post.
A group of senior members held a meeting a week ago and decided that a role for Gotabaya Rajapaksa would help unite the SLFP. They are now planning to make representations to the President in that regard. (Kelum Bandara)

War crimes allegations: UN reiterates need for credible probe
	
The United Nations on Monday reiterated the requirement of a credible investigation into the alleged human rights violations and war crimes committed by the LTTE and the Sri Lankan security forces.
UN Secretary Generals Deputy Spokesman Farhan Haq said the Human Rights Council can evaluate for itself how the process of the probe should proceed, but the UN wants to make sure there was a credible investigation into the allegations.
Well, the Human Rights Council can evaluate for itself how it's going, but we want to make sure there is a credible investigation into this. And we have made clear what our guidelines are and what a credible investigation will entail. So we will continue to be in dialogue to make sure it happens, he said in response to a question at the daily media briefing by the Spokespersons Office of the Secretary General.
Last week, President Maithripala Sirisena addressing a National Law Conference in Wadduwa reiterated that he would not allow foreign judges to take part in any kind of investigation into the allegations of human rights violations citing he had the fullest confidence in the local judges and judicial administrators.
Earlier, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Prince, Prince Zeid Raad Al Hussein, who visited Sri Lanka in February, said it was Sri Lanka's sovereign right to decide on the involvement of foreign judges in a mechanism set up to investigate alleged war crimes.
However, he criticized the Sri Lankan judiciary of being highly politicized over the years and therefore, emphasized the importance of the involvement of foreign components to ensure a credible and impartial investigation into such violations.

All service centers at the periphery of this leading state establishment are provided with a night-out facility including a comfortable bed room for the use of the respective officers in charge.
