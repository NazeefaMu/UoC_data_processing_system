CBK calls for a federal semi-secular constitution
	
Former President Chandrika Kumaratunga called for a joint effort of all parties to compile a federal semi-secular constitution in order to bring about a proper reconciliation in the country.
Ms Kumaratunga, who was speaking at a seminar organized by the national secretariat for national reconciliation in Colombo, said Sri Lanka should learn a lesson from number of countries which have resolved their issues by formulating federal and secular constitutions.
?South Africa resolved its conflict through a federal constitution. Nigeria resolved its conflict by the same means. In India there are 36 languages and dialects, and number of religions such as Jain Buddhism, Sheikism. It was a country which never had unitary status as there were several kingdoms within that country in the past. However the British brought them all together. Leaders like Nehru and Gandhi drew up a federal constitution for India as a means of gaining independence. The Indian Constitution treats that country as a Secular State. India has become a stable nation as a result of its federal and secular constitution,? Ms Kumaratunga said.
?I strongly believe that India had become a stable country as a result of devolution of power and by safeguarding the rights of all ethnic groups in that country. Nepal also faced grave issues with the fall of the monarchy and now with the help of several countries a secular constitution has been introduced? she added.
?Buddha said that everyone is equal. So why are we against giving equal rights to everyone in the nation?. Our effort is to compile a constitution which gives priority to Buddhism and gives equal rights to all other religions and at least try to convert Sri Lanka into a semi-secular state even if we are unable to convert it into a totally secular state,? she said.

Marine Police of Coastal Security Group (CSG) on Wednesday arrested A. Arul Jayarathinam alias Rajan (41), the suspected Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) militant, who was detained by Indian Coast Guard (ICG) for illegal entry into the country.
Marine Police arrested him under Section 14 of the Foreigners Act, read with Sections 3 (a) and 6 (a) of the Passport (Entry into India) Rules, 1950. He was produced before Rameswaram Magistrate Court and taken to Chennai to be remanded in judicial custody in Puzhal Central Prison.
The police said Rajan was in possession of one million US dollars, a mobile phone, baby oil and some children?s dresses. The US dollars and other properties seized from him were handed to the court, the police said.
He was detained by Mandapam Station of the ICG after he clandestinely landed at the Third Islet in the Gulf of Mannar National Park on Monday night. Interrogation by the Marine and Q Branch police revealed that he had served in the mechanical division of the LTTE from 1996 to 1998 before leaving the militant group. He faced six to seven cases ain Sri Lanka and was acquitted in all the cases, he told the officials. He however, feared threat to his life by the Lankan armed forces and arrived here clandestinely to stay with his sister living in Muthupettai near Pudumadam in the district. His sister, who arrived here as a refugee, had been residing here for more than nine years, the police said.
Rajan hailed from Mulliavalai town in Mullaitivu district in Sri Lanka?s Northern Province, the police said, adding he had come to India, leaving behind his mother, wife and four children, including three daughters. After he ?settled down? here, his wife and children planned to visit him. (Hindu)

JO calls on govt. to get people's approval for their actions
	
The joint opposition yesterday requested the Government to call for the people?s approval regarding several actions taken by the it, including its response to the assault on Sri Lanka?s High Commissioner Ibrahim Ansar in Kuala Lumpur on September 4.
Addressing a media briefing, joint opposition member and former minister Prof. G.L. Peiris said such incidents do not look good on Sri Lanka's resume, as the country's High Commissioner was a representative of the country?s pride and independence.
?When the assault on the High Commissioner was reported, there was a special seminar going on in Malaysia at Britain Cambridge University with the participation of intercontinental professionals including ministers, professors and lawyers. They have noticed this incident and one of them said that he did not have words to explain what had taken place there,? he added.
He said those professionals have also noticed that the High Commissioner was repeatedly beaten up by at least five persons. He also said such incidents had never taken place in the history of the country.
He said this sequence of events just goes to show how powerful the LTTE representatives were considering the seriousness of the assault on the High Commissioner. ?The Government cannot go against these people as it was necessary for them to repay them for the favours the Tamils had done for them through their votes,? he added.
He said the people?s approval should also be called for the introducing of new bills including the Office of Missing Persons (OMP) Bill and the so-called reconciliation that was being planned.
He also urged the government to hold the local government elections immediately without offering lame excuses for not holding them.
?It is evident from the continuous postponing, that the Government is not keen on holding the local government election as they fear that they would be defeated,? he added. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)

## Title: Sinhalese have their origins in Bengal, Odisha: Research

Sinhalese have their origins in Bengal, Odisha: Research
	
When three years back, a Sri Lankan envoy sought Indian support on the basis of the claim that the Sinhalese people are descendents of Bengalis and Odias, there was an upsurge of perplexity and outrage among large sections of the Indian population.
However, subsequent research has shown that the Sinhalese, who make up about 75 per cent of the Sri Lankan population, might very well have descended from inhabitants of ancient East India.
The ?Mahavamsa?, arguably the greatest chronicle of Sri Lanka, narrates an interesting episode that marks the origin of the Sinhalese people. As per the mythological record, the foundation stone of the Sinhalese community was laid by King Vijaya who had travelled there from North-West India in 543 BC and founded the first Sinhalese town by the name of Tambapani. One of the murals at the Ajanta caves carry an elaborate depiction of King Vijaya?s travel to the Sinhalese town.
King Vijaya was the son of Sihabahu the ruler of Sihapura in Gujarat. Sihabahu?s mother in turn was the daughter of the king of Kalinga in Eastern India. Legend goes that she conceived Sihabahu (etymologically meaning lion?s arm) with a lion that had kidnapped her.
The nature of origin myths is such that it can never prove or disprove a certain theory. However, by becoming part of local folklore, they do give some indication to the way in which the Sinhalese people remember their past. In the case of the hereditary lineage of King Vijaya, while the exact details of the story may or may not be true, what can be said with certainty is that the Sinhalese community does trace some connection to present day Bengal and Odisha. The legend gains particular currency when one realises the importance of the lion?s symbol in Sinhalese tradition.
In a recent book, ?The ocean of churn: How the Indian ocean shaped human history?, writer Sanjiv Sanyal remarks that the symbol of the lion that is so important among the Sinhalese is equally revered among the Odiyas and Bengalis. While the Narasimha (God Vishnu as half man and half lion) is worshipped in Odisha, among Bengalis the image of Goddess Durga is incomplete without the lion upon which she rides. In the opinion of Sanyal, the image of the lion on the Sri Lankan flag and the religious symbolism of the lion in Odisha and Bengal have the same cultural origins.
But it is not just mythology that reflects upon this connection. In his study titled ?Genetic affinities of Sri Lankan Populations?, Gautam Kumar Kshatriya found that 25.41 per cent of the genetic makeup on the Sinhalese population was contributed by the Bengalis. Linguistically too, scholars have for long remarked upon the Indo-Aryan origins of the Sinhalese speech.
In his celebrated account on the development of the Bengali language, Suniti Kumar Chatterjee comments upon the Indo-Aryan content in the Sinhalese speech in the following words: ?The first immigrants who carried the Indo-Aryan speech to Ceylon seem to have been from the Western Indian coast. Later from 3rd century BC onwards Ceylon seems to have come in touch with Magadha through Bengal and traditions of intimate connections between Bengal and Ceylon are preserved in Bengali literature.?
Historically speaking, what further seems to corroborate the link between Odisha, Bengal and Sri Lanka is the thriving trade between the two regions. While Ceylon (old name of Sri Lanka) depended upon Kalinga for import of elephants, Kalinga imported pearl and silver from Ceylon. Records have shown that by the 5th century BC, a strong relationship had developed between the two regions as a result of the commercial ties that spread fast enough to have its impact upon the socio-cultural and political arena.
Over the years, Sri Lanka came to be inhabited by several different communities who went on to impact the genetic makeup on the population. The colonial encounters with the Portuguese, the Dutch and then the British had its impact on the local population. Genetic studies have shown that Tamils from South India have contributed to the majority of the genetic composition of present day Sinhalese.
However, the genetic, cultural and linguistic relation that the Sinhalese population shares with the Bengalis and Odiyas, though of scholarly interest, has remained largely ignored by the popular masses. (The Indian Express)

SL refugee in UK jailed for sexually attacking woman
	
A 31-year-old Sri Lankan asylum seeker in UK has been jailed for 30 months on charges of sexually attacking a woman, three years after he was saved from deportation in a campaign led by his local MP, the Daily Mail reported on Wednesday.
Sri Lankan-born Sivarajah Suganthan, was allowed to remain in the UK thanks to a 2011 campaign headed by Lib Dem MP for Bristol West Stephen Williams.
After an 800-signature petition was presented to Parliament calling for a halt to the deportation process, Suganthan - nicknamed Siva - moved in with friends in Bristol.
But three years later the father-of-two 'preyed' on a vulnerable 21 year-old who had rejected his advances at a night shelter.
Bristol Crown Court heard that she woke at 3am to find her knickers pulled down and Suganthan forcing a sex act on her.
DNA at the scene of the assault in February 2014 proved it was him and Suganthan, who has a previous conviction for shoplifting, was arrested shortly afterwards.
After initially pleading not guilty, he confessed to the crime on the day of his trial - but still maintains he 'doesn't remember doing it', the court heard.
Two and a half years after the attack, he has been finally jailed by a judge who slammed the 'inexplicable' delay in getting the case to court.
Judge Martin Picton called for a review of the Crown Prosecution Service's handling and said 'lessons should be learned' to ensure it 'never happens again'.
He told Suganthan - who was supported in court by his English girlfriend - the incident had had a 'devastating' impact on his victim's life.
She still suffers from anxiety and depression and struggles to leave the house.
He said: 'Your victim made quite clear to you earlier in the evening that she was not receptive of your attention and she was not welcoming of any sexual contact'.
He added: 'I fully accept that you have had terrible experiences in your life. 'I fully accept that you have come a long way from the child who came to this country in a damaged condition. 'I fully accept that you have done much to change. 'There is obviously a different side to your character that is much more creditable than your awful actions on this night appear to demonstrate.'
The court heard the assaulted happened at The Julian Trust Night Shelter in St Paul's Bristol, where the woman was the only female in the dorm.
Defending, Anjali Gohil said Suganthan had a 'terrible background', and was trafficked from Sri Lanka to India and Africa and arrived on British shores in 1999.
She said: 'He was orphaned at six and was trafficked after that and made to work in slave-like conditions.'
She added Suganthan has been backed by charities, MP Stephen Williams and even has a girlfriend, Lucy Gilbert, who attended court.
She said: 'In the two long years since this took place, he has turned himself around.' Suganthan pleaded guilty to sexual assault by penetration and will serve half his sentence.
The Crown Prosecution Service did not apply for a Sexual Harm Prevention Order because the incident was a 'one off', the court heard.
Suganthan, a father of two, came to the UK in 1999 at the age of 14. His initial claim for asylum was refused in 2003, and dismissed a second time in 2004 following an appeal.
In 2011 he was volunteering at the Refugee Welcome Centre in Easton, before he was held at the Dover immigration removal centre for 37 days.
He was released after a successful campaign led by Lib Dem MP Stephen Williams, who lobbied immigration minister Damian Green to grant him asylum.
Mr Williams, former MP for Bristol West, said at the time: 'It was wonderful to meet Siva in person and to see that he was happy and smiling and delighted to be back among friends in Bristol. 'I am pleased that I and my staff were able to be of help.'

Unregulated spending on infrastructure development not wise: SF
	
Regional Development Minister Sarath Fonseka yesterday warned that it was not wise to invest colossal amounts on infrastructure development just to get a political advantage as Sri Lanka was still a poor, debt ridden country.
Minister Fonseka said his ministry expected to encourage investors to invest in areas away from the townships.
While participating at the launch of an exhibition in Colombo, Minister Fonseka said Sri Lanka should cut down on imports while encouraging exports to save as well as earn foreign exchange.
He said the present government had created an environment where the business community could engage in their business activities without any obstacles being placed in front of them.
?The President and the Prime Minister have formed a national unity government, established democracy and ensured human rights in a country where everyone can work freely. The rule of law and justice prevails in the country today and this has enabled the people to do business without offering bribes or being held to ransom,? he said.
Minister Fonseka said the government was making a sincere attempt to pull the country out of a large hole where the economy was collapsing as a result of the fake development projects launched by the previous regime after obtaining colossal loans at interest rates that were very high.
