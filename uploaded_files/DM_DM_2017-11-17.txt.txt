A hub for disaster relief  in Indian Ocean
	
This is an abridged version of an address delivered at the 1st International Disaster Convention (Colombo, November 16-18, 2015) pioneered by Training & Consultancy Firm MDF in concert with UNDP and the Disaster Management Centre. Subsequently published as A Hub for Disaster Relief in the Indian Ocean. The Case for Sri Lanka (MDF Asia, Colombo 2015) by Dr. Sinha Raja Tammita-Delgoda and Isuri Kathriarachchi.
Sri Lanka lies at the very epi-centre of the Indian Ocean. She is perfectly positioned to be a hub for disaster relief across the region
Many Sri Lankan companies are now fully aware of the link between Early Warning and Early Action
The statistics are simple. The logic is obvious. The Indian Ocean Region (IOR) covers about one seventh of the earths surface. It also occupies about 20% of the total ocean area. There are nearly 50 states in and around the IOR. These states and regions contain about 2.6 billion people, 39% of the global population. 
Sometimes called the Worlds Hazard belt, the Indian Ocean Region is deeply vulnerable to floods, droughts, cyclones, earthquakes, tidal surges, landslides and Tsunamis. 
According to the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (1995), nearly 50% of the worlds natural disasters occur in this region. What happens here affects nearly half the world.
Sometimes called the Worlds Hazard belt, the Indian Ocean Region is deeply vulnerable to floods, droughts, cyclones, earthquakes, tidal surges, landslides and Tsunamis. 

Sri Lanka lies at the very epi-centre of the Indian Ocean. She is perfectly positioned to be a hub for disaster relief across the region. It is a role for which she is well equipped. In her hotel sector, her insurance companies, her media and her armed forces, Sri Lanka has shown that she possesses a wealth of expertise and experience. 
Hubs are not all about trade, they denote cooperation, sharing and mutual benefit. They are about being centres, centres of activity and centres of information. Disaster Relief and Management are all about cooperation and working together with every country towards a common human need. 
Now that they have been told so by others, Sri Lankans themselves are now starting to talk about an Indian Ocean future, one which opens up many horizons, far beyond the confines of South Asia. Sri Lanka has the chance to position herself at the very heart of this initiative, to be the central part of a wheel around which everything revolves. As an initiative, it is a country opportunity; one which fulfils a strategic need and serves a national interest. 
In 2009 journalist, writer, and strategic analyst, Robert Kaplan predicted that the Indian Ocean will form the centre of gravity in the coming century, centre stage for the challenges of the 21st century. This idea became the foundation of a best selling and deeply influential book, Monsoon: the Indian Ocean and the Future of American Power. 
Geologically and tectonically, the Indian Ocean Region is one of the most unstable regions on earth. The African, Indian and Antarctic Plates all converge in the IOR. When they converge these areas experience great earthquakes of huge magnitudes and very often these trigger great tsunamis or marine surges. Tropical cyclones very often ravage the coastal parts of India, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Thailand, Sumatra, Eastern Africa, the Arabian Peninsula, Sri Lanka and Pakistan. In 2007-2008 and 2009 three mega cyclones occurred in the northern Bay of Bengal causing great loss of life and massive destruction in Bangladesh, Myanmar and India. Recurring floods and cyclonic coastal surges are also common phenomena all along the coastal states. On land tornadoes and landslides are also very common and devastating. 
Natural disasters do not follow political boundaries. Therefore early and successful dissemination of information and scientific data among the vulnerable areas can make an immense contribution to the safety of the whole region
The World Index of Vulnerability to Natural Disasters identifies several categories, very high, high and medium. All these countries lie in and around the Indian Ocean. 
The 2014 Climate Change Vulnerability Index identifies Bangladesh, Ethiopia. Cambodia, the Phillipines, nearly all Indian Ocean countries. It also identifies some of the worlds most vulnerable cities. Dhaka Chennai, Mumbai and Kolkata, Manila, Bangkok, Jakarta. As Global Warming continues, the frequency, magnitude and severity of these natural disasters are increasing alarmingly and will increase. It is a fact of the future. 
The maps reflecting global risk underline that the highest peril is to developing countries. The states along the rim land areas of the countries in Eastern Africa, Southern Asia and South Asia are mostly poor and developing nations. Maplecrofts Climate Change and Environmental Risk Atlas reveals that 31% of global economic output will be based in such countries facing high or extreme risks from climate change by 2025. 
Apart from its environmental importance, the IOR has tremendous economic significance. Half of the worlds container traffic passes through Indian Ocean and 70% of the Worlds Crude and Oil travel along its sea lanes. Nearly 30% of world trade is handled in the ports of the Indian Ocean. The security and safety of the Indian Ocean region is not just a regional issue, it is now a global concern. A natural disaster in the Indian Ocean will affect the global economy

Natural disasters do not follow political boundaries. Therefore early and successful dissemination of information and scientific data among the vulnerable areas can make an immense contribution to the safety of the whole region. There is currently a very serious gap in the data and information relating to international disaster management in this region. To fill this gap we need a research institute which will concentrate on the challenges of climatic change and associated disasters throughout the Indian Ocean. An International Centre of this kind can easily be established here in Sri Lanka. Geography suggests that this is the most convenient and the most logical place. Fitting in with the countrys ambition to become a hub, it is also a way of involving everyone. 
Over the last few years Sri Lanka has built up a wealth of knowledge, resources and skills about how to prepare and cope with disaster. This represents a country opportunity. Not only does resilience have massive cost benefits, it also helps generate new business and wealth. For individuals, corporations and for the country, it is also a commercial and marketing opportunity.

Many Sri Lankan companies are now fully aware of the link between Early Warning and Early Action. Although there were several hours between the earthquake and the tsunami, almost all of the victims of the Indian Ocean tsunami were taken by surprise because there were no early detection or early warning systems in place. A warning delivered 90 seconds in advance of the impact would have saved many lives. In Sri Lanka estimates indicate that around 85% of lives lost could have been saved if such a system had been in place in 2004. It was in response to this that Sri Lankas leading mobile network, Dialog developed Dewn - Dialogs Disaster And Emergency Warning Network. Launched in 2014 the DEWN system connects mobile subscribers, emergency responders, community leaders and the general public to a national emergency monitoring centre at the National Disaster Management Centre (NDMC). As a commercial and an economic driver, it has tremendous international potential. 
Apart from foreign aid, one of the levers which drive recovery after a disaster is insurance. Since the Tsunami of 2004 many proactive developments have taken place in this area and Sri Lanka now has a highly developed insurance system. Companies such as Janashakthi have pioneered special insurance policies for all kinds of natural disasters. However, only 12.6% of Sri Lankans are covered by a life insurance policy; even fewer have a comprehensive policy. Other parts of the Indian Ocean Region which are just as vulnerable to natural disaster have even less insurance cover. There is surely an opportunity here. 
In the event of disaster, an effective and experienced military is one of the most important resources a government can call on. The armed forces must have the expertise and the experience to organize, act quickly and reach remote places with life saving supplies and skills. Over the last few years Sri Lankas armed forces have proved themselves very effective in disaster recovery operations. In the floods and landslides of 2014 the three services carried out a variety of roles, rescuing those in danger, evacuating people in high risk areas and providing alternative accommodation, cooked meals and health facilities for thousands of people at a time.

The Army is also an instrument of national policy and prestige. What it does at home, it can do just as well abroad. When the earthquake struck Nepal, Sri Lanka was among the first countries to send rescue teams. On April 26 2015, within less than 24 hours army personnel and civil medical consultants had left for Nepal on-board on a Sri Lanka Air Force (SLAF) plane. 
Launched in coordination with the Disaster Management Centre in Colombo, the rapid response and relief operations in the immediate aftermath of the earthquake in Nepal was the first of its kind undertaken overseas by Sri Lanka. The success of this mission underlines a new role for Sri Lanka in the region. As the Indian Ocean Region becomes ever more important, so will the Sri Lanka Navy. At present the worlds largest and busiest logistics hub for humanitarian aid is the International Humanitarian City (IHC) in Dubai. Established in 2003, the IHCs capabilities and strategic location  within eight hours by air to two-thirds of the worlds population  have helped deliver assistance in some of the worst humanitarian crises of the past decade. It is now the centre of a multi-billion dollar global humanitarian logistics industry which coordinates the acquisition and delivery of services and supplies to crisis-stricken areas. 
Part of the appeal of Dubai lies in its strategic location. It is at the centre of a communications and transport hub with an airport and a port. Sri Lanka too, has a very strategic location. It is on the circum-equatorial route, the shortest route to circumnavigate the world. Hambantota is only 10 nautical miles off the worlds busiest shipping lane, at the very pivot of the world sea lane connecting east and west. It is here that the shipping routes to Africa connect with those to the Far East. Hambantota is also closer to the vulnerable areas in the eastern sector of the Indian Ocean. Right next door to the port is Mattala Airport. In Dubai 85 per cent of the office space is occupied while 95 per cent of its warehouse space is taken. At Hambantota there is plenty of space for offices and warehouses and plenty of space for expansion. This is its advantage. 
Sri Lanka is the perfect stepping stone to Philippines, Indonesia, Bangladesh, Thailand, Myanmar, Vietnam, Nepal and India. If there is another massive humanitarian disaster in Bangladesh or Philippines, flying in and out of Hambantota rather than out of Dubai will represent a massive saving in time, money and fuel. There is also a massive cost advantage. 
The MDF forum was the first step towards creating a multilateral dialogue around disaster resilience. The objective was to help promote Sri Lanka a hub for disaster relief, knowledge and management in the Indian Ocean. Involving will help us take a centre stage. Sri Lanka can use this opportunity to take the lead, to be the pivot of an integrated response in the cause of humanity. In this context everyone has to work together. In a multi lateral effort no one nation can predominate. This is one way of bringing everyone here. It is the very definition of a hub. 
A Hub for Disaster Relief in the Indian Ocean Is there a case for Sri Lanka The statistics are simple, the geography is compelling, the logic is obvious. It is in the National Interest; there is also a Strategic Need.

Accusations fly during showdown between Senasinghe, JO members
	
State Minister Sujeewa Senasinghe was involved in a showdown with joint opposition MPs D V Chanaka and Namal Rajapaksa yesterday when the two MPs informed Parliament that Mr. Senasinghe has had more than 54 conversations with Perpetual Treasuries Limited owner Arjun Aloysius.
A heated argument followed after Senasinghe started making allegations against the MPs. Malli do not shout as I have appeared for your father and got him cleared when he was involved in a case involving some ships," Senasinghe said.
At this point MP Namal Rajapaksa inquired about the contents of the conversation that took place between the State Minister and Aloysius, which elicited a retort from Senasinghe about the validity of legal training obtained by MP Rajapaksa. I challenge you to answer this question. Everyone knows how you sat for law examinations, he said.
Coming up with more allegations, Senasinghe brought up the subject of the Thajudeen killing. Undeterred, MP Rajapaksa challenged him to name the person who killed the former National rugby player. State Minister Senasinghe relented and refused to do so.
Later, Senasinghe told journalists that he is prepared to face any probe as he had nothing to be afraid. I have nothing to be afraid of as I have not done anything wrong, he said. (Yohan Perera and Ajith Siriwardene)

Avant Garde Case: Gota, 7 others to be tried on Feb.26 and Mar.26
	
The Colombo Chief Magistrates Court today refused to put off for another date the reading of the charges to the accused and fixed the trial on the corruption case against former defence secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa and seven others.
The Bribery Commission (BC) filed 19 charges against the suspects for causing a Rs.11.4 billion loss to the government by permitting Avant Garde Maritime Services (Pvt) Limited to operate a floating armoury. The BC named 60 witnesses in the case.
When the case was taken up before Colombo Chief Magistrate Lal Ranasinghe Bandara, he rejected the preliminary objections raised by defence counsel on an earlier occasion and the charges were read out to the suspect.
Earlier, when the matter came up before the Chief Magistrate, Presidents Counsel Romesh de Silva appearing for the first accused Gotabaya Rajapaksa had raised preliminary objections that the Bribery Commission Director General had filed this case without the written sanction of the Bribery Commission.
He said when the charges were brought up in Court under Section 70 (Corruption), the prosecution should obtain a mandatory sanction or a written consent from the BC according to Section 78 (1) of the Bribery Act.
However, Senior State Counsel Janaka Bandara appearing for the BC informed Court that the Commission had given its consent to this legal action and requested the Magistrate to fix the case for trial.
The Magistrate fixed the case for trail on February 26 and March 26, 2018. (Yoshitha Perera)

Customs seize 656 Kg of Glyphosate
	
A stock of the banned chemical Glyphosate worth Rs.3.3 million, was seized at the Rank Container Terminal (RCT) in Orugodawatta today, Customs Superintendent Ranjith Kumarasinghe said.
He said during the investigations, Customs officers found 656 kilograms of Glyphosate powder packed in 14 boxes.
Each box contained 20 packets of Glyphosate weighing 100 grams each and 10 packets of one kilogram each packed in 14 separate boxes, Mr. Kumarasinghe said and added that the 20-foot container had arrived at the Colombo Port from Tuticorin in Tamil Nadu on Wednesday.
He said the container was loaded with sacks of potato and green chillies and the consignment declared as potatoes.
When examining the Customs declaration papers, the officers found a scanned copy of the invoice attached to the declaration papers. The Customs Officers who felt suspicious of the documents, had started investigations, Mr. Mr. Kumarasinghe said.
The officers had noticed the boxes of Glyphosate after the potatoes were unloaded. They were under sacks of green chillie, Mr.Kumarasinghe said.
The importer was identified as a businessman from the Ja-ela who was also a resident of Saindamadu in Kalmunai.
Some 12,710 kilograms of potatoes worth Rs.800,000 and 1,806 kilograms of green chillies worth Rs.1.8 million were among the goods unloaded from the container. It is illegal to import green chillies to Sri Lanka. The stock of potatoes and green chillie could have been contaminated with Glyphosate. The customs will release the stock of potatoes after an inspection by food inspectors," Mr. Kumarasinghe said.
The raid was carried out on the instructions of Customs Director H.M.S. Premarathne under the supervision of Deputy Director G.G Premasiri. Investigations were carried out by Customs Deputy Directors Ranjith Kumarasinghe, Chandana Dharmapriya, R.M.C.U. Ratnayaka, Customs Appraisers Ms. Chandani Senavirathne, Chandana Gamage Nalin Perera, Keerthi Herath, G.K. Ravihansa and Assistant Superintendent L. Tennakoon. (Chaturanga Pradeep)

## Title: Dont  allow   COPD    to obstruct your life!

Dont  allow   COPD    to obstruct your life!
	
People who are COPD patients should understand that it is not the end of the world for them. Pulmonary rehabilitation is available in many hospitals which will help them lead comfortable and better quality lives. Refrain from giving up,
-Dr. Keerthi Gunasekera

November hosts numerous world health days. World Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) Day is yet another which fell on November 15. This calls for the spotlight on COPD. Its a disease that strongly impacts the life of a patient. Lifelong treatment is required if someone falls prey to the ailment, in order to avoid fatal conditions. But where theres life, there is hope and its the same regarding this situation. Dr. Keerthi Gunasekera, Consultant Respiratory Physician at the Central Chest Clinic and National Hospital of Sri Lanka, Colombo, spoke to Health Capsule regarding COPD. 
Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a condition that affects the airways of the respiratory system. This includes the breathing tubes of the lungs. It causes damage to the lungs itself, affecting the lung tissue (lungparenchyma), Dr. Gunasekera explained. Unlike asthma, where the disease is limited to affecting the breathing tubes, COPD affects the entire lung itself, he added further. 
Exposure to a poisonous or toxic agent on a long term basis can create irritation of the airways and lung tissue leading to COPD. The malady is similar to asthma in terms of the airways becoming narrower and an obstruction caused to the air flow through these airways.This impedance in the air flow results in a difficulty in breathing, he said. 



Asthma and COPD, are they similar 
Dr. Gunasekera explained that in asthma patients, the respiratory airways tighten at night, causing difficulty to breathe. But during the day, the airways dilate back to normal and breathing returns to normalcy. In this case, the narrowing of the airways in asthma is reversible. But where COPD is concerned, the tightening of the airways is an irreversible progressive condition where breathing is obstructed and inflammation is caused, he said. 
Substances known as allergens trigger asthma. According to Dr. Gunasekera, an allergen could be pollen, house dust, etc that could arouse asthma. COPD is caused by long term exposure to noxious or toxic substances. This results in irritation and permanent damage to the lungs, he added. 
Speaking on the causes of COPD, Dr. Gunasekera listed that smoking, exposure to toxic fumes on a long term basis and people with premature births are more susceptible to COPD. Not all smokers get COPD though. Non smokers also fall victim to COPD. According to studies in China,exposure to fire wood fumes when cooking with a hearth is also seen as a cause of the disease.Therefore females at homes, without ventilation, can also develop COPD when exposed to firewood fumes. There is a genetic implication as well. A family history of COPD might mean that a person may be susceptible to COPD. Environmental factors also affect the contraction of the disease, Dr. Gunasekera stressed. 
COPD is a progressive disease. The predominant symptom is the shortening of breath.Coughing is another sign. Wheezing may or may not be present. 
Are you suffering from copd

According to Dr. Gunasekera, spirometry is used in the diagnosis of COPD. It is the testing of lung functioning. The obstruction of the airways is measured through the test. A healthy person is able to expire 80% of air in the lungs in one second.If the airways of the lungs are narrowed, the volume of expired air will be less than 80%. So a patient is asked to breathe out as much air as possible. If the exhaled volume of air is less than 80%, it indicates an obstruction in the lung airways. This raises suspicions that the patient suffers from either asthma or COPD. A bronchodilator is used to confirm the ailment. A bronchodilator stimulates dilation of the airways. The patient will be tested again to measure the volume of exhaled air. If the volume is 80% or more after the use of the bronchodilator, it can be confirmed that the patient suffers from asthma. If the volume doesnt still reach a level of 80%, the patient suffers from COPD, he accentuated. The reason behind this is that the tightening of airways is reversible in asthma but is not so in COPD. 
Dr. Gunasekera mentioned that the progression of this condition is divided into stages (stage 1, 2, 3, 4 etc). The severity level of COPD is determined by the percentage of air that a person is able to breathe out from the total volume of air in the lungs. If a person breathes out less than 30%, then the patient suffers from very severe COPD. If it lies within the range of 30% -50%, then it is moderate COPD. If the reading is in the range of 50% -80%, then the patient is in the early or mild stage of the disease, he informed. 
Emphysema is a consequence of COPD. Its the over inflation of the lungs.Expiration doesnt take place efficiently due to the narrowing of airways, resulting in trapping of air in the lungs. This can be seen in a chest x-ray. The diaphragm appears to be pushed down, the heart is narrower and the x-ray appears blacker, the doctor stated. 
Treatment is the key 
COPD cant be completely cured as the process cant be reversed. But the progression of the disease can be stopped. Cessation of smoking is important. Bronchodilators will be recommended, but they may not prove very effective for some patients. In later stages of the disease, patients will be extremely short of breath as their oxygen levels are low. So home oxygen will be necessary. When lungs get overstretched, pressure is applied on blood vessels and ultimately pressure builds up on the heart, causing pulmonary hypertension, and leads to heart failure on the right side of the heart. This is known as Cor Pulmonale. This is a cardiac disease secondary to lung disease, stressed Dr. Gunasekera.

These patients are given oxygen in low doses. There are high levels of carbon dioxide in these patients which they cant expirate. Their bodies get used to the high levels of carbon dioxide. So their respiratory drive depends on carbon dioxide. Hence, they respond to low oxygen levels. Dr. Gunasekera warned that if high dose oxygen levels are given to these patients, their respiration stops. 

Not all smokers get COPD though. Non smokers also fall victim to COPD. According to studies in China,exposure to fire wood fumes when cooking with a hearth is also seen as a cause of the disease.Therefore females at homes, without ventilation, can also develop COPD when exposed to firewood fumes
Treatments include oral drugs such as bronchodilators, inhalers and sometimes steroids (but they may not be as effective as in asthma). Pulmonary rehabilitation is a very vital part of treatment. COPD patients cant exert themselves much, as they become breathless at the slightest exertion. Pulmonary rehabilitation teaches patients how to breathe, walk, exercise, etc helping them to improve their physical condition. Exercise is especially vital for these patients and pulmonary rehabilitation ensures that these patients exercise in appropriate manners which suits them, he clarified. 
The lung functioning of these patients are greatly affected by infections. This could lead to lung damages. If a patient is affected severely more than twice by infections, they might have to get hospitalized and their survival time may be less. They will not be able to return to normalcy. Mortality is high. 
So it is important to protect these patients from falling victim to infections. COPD patients are vaccinated against influenza. They are vaccinated with the Hib influenza vaccine as well as the pneumococcal vaccine against pneumonia, informed the doctor. 
Preventive measures include avoiding habits such as smoking. It is important to take precautions to prevent inhalation of toxic substances over long periods of time. 
Are you at risk 
When asked about the risk groups, Dr. Gunasekera mentioned that COPD is usually not seen in children. It is seen more in people above the age 40. In 2013-2014, an islandwide study was conducted on Obstructive Lung Diseases (OLD). Using spirometry, they conducted the study among 2000 people. 10.5% of the people were found to be COPD patients. The value 10.5% is quite high, he stressed.

Gamini Senarath case: Fixed for Nov.24
	
The Supreme Court today fixed for November 24 the granting of leave to proceed with the fundamental rights petition filed by ex-president's chief-of-staff Gamini Senarath and the two other FR petitions filed by SLIC's ex-managing director Piyadasa Kudabalage and Samurdhi's ex-commissioner Neil Bandara Hapuwinna
Presidents Counsel Romesh de Silva with Sugath Caldera and Niran Anketell informed the Bench comprising Chief Justice Priyasath Dep and Justice Anil Gooneratne that the petitioner was now in remand and the bail application filed in the Fort Magistrates Court and the order on bail is fixed for November 21. Senior State Counsel Suhashi Herath appeared for the respondents.
The petitioners are seeking a Supreme Court order preventing the FCID from arresting them on the magisterial inquiries under the Public Property Act with the case being filed in the Colombo Fort Magistrates Court on charges of misusing Rs.4 billion in government funds.
The petitioners cited Police Chief Pujitha Jayasundara, the FCID Director, the Attorney General and several others as respondents.
According to the report filed in the Colombo Fort Magistrates Court, they have been accused of misusing government funds by illegally investing Rs.4 billion from the Rs.18.5 billion approved by the Cabinet in 2012 Grand Hyatt Regency Hotel in Kollupitiya. It was to be constructed by a company affiliated to the Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation (SLIC). The Rs.4 billion had been invested in the Hyatt Regency Hotel Project in Hambantota. (S.S.

Giving society a third eye through poetry Marlon launches Akuru
	
Freelance journalist, Marlon Widanapathirana, who contributes to Sunday Lankadeepa, Tharunaya and GO magazine, published his maiden collection of poems titled Akuru. A cinematographer, a journalist and now a poet, Marlon began exploring the world of poets with Akuru. Following are excerpts of an interview done with Widanapathirana.
QYou have published your maiden book on poetry. Why did you use the title Akuru
I was thinking of using Akuru as the title of my first poetry book. Theres a story about my handwriting. I had the ugliest handwriting in my class. On the first day of the English class I attended in grade 9, the teacher asked me to bring a double rule book to practise writing. Therefore, I wanted to name my first collection of poems AKURU.
QWere you planning for a long time to write this book or is it just the right time And what are your interests in poetry
The ones for this collection were selected from among numerous poems I wrote from time to time. There are 25 poems written on various themes, mostly focusing on matters less evident to the society. No preface nor afterword has been used in the book.
QWho are the individuals who have made a huge influence on your poetry
The biggest influence on mehas been made by poets like Manjula Wediwardana and Monica Ruwanpathirana. I learned a great deal from them.
 QWhen was the book launch
The launching of Akuru was a light event held at Sripali Mandapaya, in the Colombo University. It was also a special occasion because a few days later I had to attend the graduation ceremony of the special degree in Cinematography, which I followed at University of Kelaniya.
Marlon Widanapathirana
 QAkuru isnt merely a book on poetry and you have translated these Sinhala poems into English. How do you feel about doing so

I think this is the first ever bilingual book on poetry published in the Sri Lankan university history in both Sinhala and English languages simultaneously.

My younger brother Akash, who works as a journalist at Sunday Times, translated the book from Sinhala to English.

The cover of the book was designed by Diman Darshana Hettiarachchi.
Akash Widanapathirana
QWhat are you currently working on Will there be a second poetry book as well
I am getting ready to co-direct a childrens movie in which the script was also written by me.

Man develops symptoms of pregnancy
	
A woman who came to live in a rural area in the Southern province had begun a healthcare service centre for married women who are not fortunate to have children.
Those who came to her with the hope of becoming mothers have developed symptoms of pregnancy after taking the medicine she had given.
After coming to know about this witch-craft doctor a wife who was worried about delayed pregnancy has gone without the knowledge of her husband to her and received the necessary medicine. She was also advised not to see doctors for any changes that take place in her body
When the husband saw his wife taking some drugs, he had questioned her about it. She had answered the drug was for knee pains.
The husband who was also suffering from a leg pain had asked for some medicine of his wife and gulped it.
He had continued to take these medicines for a couple of months.
After a few months both the wife and the husband had developed symptoms of pregnancy with enlarged abdomen.
Latter it was revealed that the so called witch-craft woman had given some substance to her patients that causes the enlargement of the abdomen. (Upasena Liyanagama)

BUSTER: Antibiotics are medications that fight infections, caused by bacteria. A flu is an influenza or virus causing fever. Viruses arent affected by antibiotics. They will only have an effect on bacterial infections. In fact it is not good to give antibiotics when there are some symptoms since you can be exposed to other infections, explained Dr. Kosala Karunaratne, Consultant Pediatrician, Lady Ridgeway Hospital.

Seeking postponement of LG polls: SLFP supporters behind move claims JO
	
It transpired in Parliament yesterday that six supporters of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) had moved the Supreme Court against the gazette notification delimitation on the local government elections.
Joint Opposition MP for the Matara district Kanchana Wijesekara said three supporters of Ministers Lakshman Yapa Abeywardane, Dilan Perera and Dayasiri Jayasekara were among the petitioners. He said the remaining three were also supporters of the SLFP in the government.
He made the disclosure in response to Deputy Minister Ajith P. Perera who accused the Joint Opposition of resorting to legal action to secure a postponement of the election. He was interrupted by the Joint opposition MPs at this time leading to some anxious moments.
Mr. Perera said the Joint Opposition should expose those responsible unless they were not for it. In fact, he agreed to share the time allotted to him if MP Wijesekara was ready to make the disclosure.
Upon his permission, Mr. Wijesekara revealed it. Mr Perera said the UNP is for holding the poll as soon as possible. He said any party, be it under the symbols betel leaf, flower bud or anything, should be ready to face the polls.
Deputy Minister Dilan Perera denied the involvement of any of his supporters in it.
Chief Opposition Whip Anura Kumara Dissanayake who made his remarks said it was obvious who was seeking postponement of polls .
Nobody can conceal it from the public eye. It is a shame to do so. The whole country knows who is trying to withhold elections, he said. (Yohan Perera and Ajith Siriwardana)

SL committed to non-discrimination based on sexual orientation: Nerin Pulle
	
Sri Lanka said it remains committed to law reform and guaranteeing non-discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity despite the socio-political and cultural challenges that remain with respect to reforming laws.
Responding to the questions and concerns raised at the third Universal Periodic Review (UPR) of Sri Lanka in Geneva on Wednesday (15), Deputy Solicitor General Nerin Pulle said Sri Lanka was in the process of taking measures to guarantee the right to non-discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity.
He pointed out three key developments achieved in terms of protecting and promoting rights of the LGBTIQ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, intersex, queer/questioning) community.
One development is that the government is committed to reforming the Penal Code to ensure that all offences contained in the Code are in compliance with international human rights standards. The government is committed to ensuring that no provision in the law would be applied to persons of the LGBTIQ community in a discriminatory manner, he said.
He also said the present constitutional reform process includes the consideration of the explicit guarantee of non-discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation.
Mr. Nerin Pulle said the Supreme Court has made a recent progressive pronouncement on Penal Code offences that may be applied to same sex sexual conduct. In SC appeal 32/11, the court acknowledged contemporary thinking that consensual sex between adults should not be policed by the State nor should it be grounds for criminalization. While acknowledging that such offences are part of Sri Lankas criminal law, the court held that imposing custodial sentences would be inappropriate in cases where the impugned acts were between consenting adults, he said.

Taking a closer look at   waterborne   diseases
	
With the rains comes various diseases. Speaking to the Health Capsule Prof. Arjuna de Silva, Professor in Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Ragama, explained the different water borne diseases and infections that are commonly present in Sri Lanka. Such diseases can spread due to the contamination of drinking water with sewage water. He further sighted examples such as dengue, gastroenteritis, typhoid, Hepatitis A and skin rashes as the most common illnesses. There are various parasitic diseases that can happen, but the worm infestation an amoebiosis is less because of improved conditions. Cholera too can occur, but not in Sri Lanka unless it is imported, explained the professor. 
Dengue
Prof. de Silva stated that one of the main diseases to watch out for during the rainy season, in the current context, is dengue. Although it is not transmitted through water it is one of the most deadly illnesses that spreads during the rainy season. 
He further explained where the disease can originate. During the rainy season dengue can spread due to the increase in breeding sites for mosquitoes. Generally the mosquito breeds in clear water, so there are sights outside the house as well as inside such as plants and gutters where the water accumulates. Recent research has shown that the mosquito is adapting and can even breed in salt water or dirty water. However the main breeding site is still the accumulation of clear water. he explained. 
Prof. de Silva continued to explain the symptoms that are experienced. There will be high fever, pain behind the eyes, headaches and aches in the body. The fever can even drop and return. The main problem is when patients exert themselves. Patients should take bed rest and take paracitamol. They shouldnt take asprin or any drugs that are used for joint pains. You should do a dengue antigen test within the first twenty four hours. Even if the test or the blood count are normal initially it is important to rest and keep checking the blood to make sure the platelet count is not dropping. Because the dengue antigen test is not 100% accurate, he said. 
Speaking of preventive measure that should be taken the professor said, A vaccine is being made. But there are other measures that should be taken. You must make sure the environment is clean and there are no breeding sites. The Government alone cant do that, people also have to chip in. You must make sure that you are not bitten by mosquitoes by wearing mosquito repellant whenever you leave the house and wear long clothing, keeping skin exposure to a minimum. But the main thing is to make sure that the breeding sights are destroyed. 
Prof. de Silva went on to explain about diseases that increase due to flooding. Diseases such as gastroenteritis, typhoid and hepatitis A are transmitted through oral means.
Gastroenteritis
Prof. de Silva explained gastroenteritis, its symptoms and treatment, This is the inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract that involves the stomach and the small intestine. It is quite a broad term and one of the main diseases that are spread during the rainy season, especially when there is flooding. The symptoms that you can experience are abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea along with fever. If it is immediate you have to take bed rest. If there is fever and no vomiting you have to give the patient liquids like jeevani. And if there is vomiting you have to admit the patient and give him/her an IV as well. Fluids and bed rest are the main treatment options and if it is a bacterial infection antibiotics have to be given said the professor.
Typhoid
Typhoid is a bacterial illness which is caused due to bacteria called paratyphoid and typhoid. This causes fever, headaches, abdominal pain and can even cause diarrhea. Antibiotics are prescribed as well, explained Prof. de Silva. 
Hepatitis A
Prof. de Silva explained, Hepatitis A is a viral infection which can damage the liver. A definite symptom is yellow discolouration of the eyes. Others include fever, abdominal pain and weakness. There is a vaccine that is given for this condition, in addition to bed rest and fluids that are recommended. Hepatitis B is not commonly seen in Sri Lanka,he added.
Skin Rashes
Speaking of skin conditions that can be transmitted he said,These are mainly allergies. These are skin conditions that are developed due to muddy and contaminated water. You can develop rashes and experience itching. You must avoid contact with water, wear boots and suitable clothing. If contacted, wash it off as soon as possible. Generally it is an allergic reaction. When you develop a skin infection you can apply an antibiotic cream. Asteroid cream can be used if it is an allergy. 
Prevention
Speaking on preventive measures that should be taken the professor said, If there is flooding it is difficult to sort out. Consume boiled and clean water, bottled water and make sure that the water source is secure. Make sure that the food that you use is not raw and is cooked well. When you have vegetables wash and cook them. You should not have things like salads otherwise there is a higher chance of getting infected.

## Title: TEA Wants to Import tea: why

TEA Wants to Import tea: why
	
Two articles in Daily Mirror on tea (Nov 9 by M.J. Fernando Nov. 10 by Tea Exporters Association (TEA) highlight the controversy on importation of tea. As Mr Fernando has said importing tea, and blending it with local Ceylon Tea will bring down the quality of Ceylon Tea and may cause prices to decrease. TEA appears to be of the opinion that the growth of the tea sector is restricted by non-availability of adequate quantities of tea and hence, TEA has proposed to liberalize tea imports to address the declining trend in the countrys tea export share.

According to the Central Bank reports around 200,000 ha are under tea. As indicated in the table the total production of tea has continued to decrease from 340 million kg in 2013 to 292 million kg in 2016 although TEA says that the tea production has stagnated around 330 million kg. The amount of tea exports too has decreased during the last few years. In 2014 we exported 327 million kg but this value has decreased to 289 million kg in 2016 . As indicated in the table, foreign exchange earnings from tea have continued to decrease in spite of some tea being imported for re-exports. As indicated in the article by TEA, Sri Lankas share in the world tea market has come down from 10.5 % in 2000 to 6% in 2016 and this is likely to go down further and the country will not achieve the expected foreign exchange targets. All these data indicate that there is something wrong in our tea sector.

According to TEA in the article of Nov. 10 there is no accepted plan to increase tea production and hence propose to increase liberalization of tea imports to address the declining tea exports. In such a situation it is better to formulate an effective plan to increase tea production in the country rather than importing lower quality tea and blending it with Ceylon Tea. Importing tea to be blended with Ceylon Tea will be detrimental to the tea sector as what happened to some other sectors such as Pepper in the recent past. TEA suggests that there should be a tea hub in Sri Lanka. When our tea production is going down and also when there is a strong tea hub in a central place such as Dubai, a proposal to have a tea hub is unrealistic. In the rubber sector too a unrealistic master plan involving US $ 500 million has been developed and is going to be implemented.

Almost 90% of the tea produced in the country is exported. Hence, the opinion of TEA that the growth of the tea sector is restricted by non-availability of adequate quantities of tea is not correct. There may be a number of factors which caused our share in the world tea market to come down during the last few years. One of these is possibly high costs. It is necessary that a detail study is made to determine what factors cause our share in the world tea market to come down.

An analysis of tea production levels in tea producing countries indicate that Sri Lanka has lagged behind. According to FAO statistics our average tea YPH in 2014 which stood at 1522 kg/ha is well below the average tea YPH of 25 countries such as Iran, Japan, Kenya, Vietnam . The success of the Kenyan tea industry has been ascribed to appropriate research and development (R&D) by the Kenya Tea Research Institute. The decline in the tea sector in Sri Lanka can be attributed to a number of factors. Among these are land degradation, shortage of water, old age crop etc.
Land Degradation
Productivity of large extents under tea has decreased mainly due to soil erosion, soil compaction, and nutrition depletion etc, . Land degradation would cause yields to decline and have a negative impact on our efforts to increase production. A substantial extent of tea lands are eroded and there is hardy any soil for the tea plants grow. According to various reports around 40 t/ha of soil in tea estates are lost annually due to soil erosion. The participants of the first national symposium on Land Degradation, held a few years ago, who were representing many land-related institutions in the country, were of the view that urgent action such as implementation of proper land use planning and the soil conservation and environment act etc. need to be taken by the relevant organizations to control land degradation.
Age of tea plants
A considerable extent of the tea crop is mature and old. For example, 40% of the tea extent is under seedling tea and about 90% of the seedling teas are over 60 years old and need replanting. Around 30% of the VP tea are more than 30 years old and these also need replanting. Replanting had been neglected in the 1960s and 1970s partly because of low tea prices and high export duties and low profit margins . The area replanted does not show any substantial increase during the last few years. In fact, it has decreased from 2013.
Water shortage
VP plants being having a fibrous system are unable to stand dry conditions. As a result production of tea goes down during the dry periods. This situation is worsened by soil erosion. It is possible to overcome this situation by activities such as increasing organic matter levels of the surface soils by mulching, reducing run-off, better water management etc. which would increase water holding capacity of the soil. Implementing appropriate rain-water harvesting programmes would reduce the undesirable effects of drought.
Labour shortage
It is a common knowledge that at present there is a dearth of labour in the tea sectors as in many other crop sectors. According to a labour force survey in 2000, 36 % of the labour force was working in the agriculture sector. In 2008 this value has dropped to 33% and in 2014 it has further dropped down to 29%. As a result of labour shortage weed control and other cultural practices and tea plucking are affected.
What should be done
There are tea lands in which the annual production is very low. For example, the average YPH of some estates owned by the state is as low as 358 kg. A survey need to be done to identify these unproductive tea lands, and these need to be diversified. Such lands may be put under pasture and have cattle . This will reduce our expenditure on milk imports, and also degradation of the lands will be reduced resulting in less silting of the reservoirs and reduce incidence of floods. There are many other crops such as spice crops etc. , energy yielding crops such as glyricida and fruit crops which could be cultivated on the unproductive tea lands. These crops would give better returns to the cultivators. An in-depth study need to be carried out to determine appropriate land use in the unproductive holdings/estates giving due consideration to factors such as climate, topography, availability of labour etc. 
Those tea lands which are not going to be diversified need to be managed better. In this regard, infilling, cultivation of better tea cultivars and their effective management including better fertilizer and pest management practices, , increased rate of replanting, reducing soil degradation and conservation practices are essential. The demand for tea bags appears to be increasing. In countries such as Saudi Arabia, Jordan the tea bag share has increased over and above the loose tea market. Hence, it is obvious that we need to promote production of tea bags. 
It is better to implement activities to increase the productivity of the tea sector rather than importing low quality tea thereby diluting the quality of our tea.

The State withers away The third of four articles delving into the Left movement in Sri Lanka
	
Somewhere in the late eighties, with the collapse of communism, the world that had hitherto been split into two camps shifted into an Us versus Them dichotomy of a different sort, this time between the multilateralists and the unilateralists. As Prof. Nalin de Silva so eloquently put it, the world didnt become multi-polar, which means, obviously enough, that history didnt end. Fukuyama was wrong, Huntington wasnt. Superpowers had been built on the assumption that there was an enemy to be fought, somewhere, and it could include entire continents and cultures and civilizations. We were promised that life would get simpler. It didnt. The truth is, it couldnt.
Vijaya Kumaratunga
Today the multilateralists have, for all intents and purposes, sided with the unilateralists. Vast wars are embarked on, vast sums of money are spent on weapons, and what was described by Eisenhower as the military-industrial complex has expanded so exponentially that no number of leaked documents can do justice to its scope. Life couldnt get simpler because the idea of two superpowers fighting against each other, or keeping the peace with each other, insured the rest of the world against one country, one empire, gaining a monopoly over everyone else. Once that was out, things could only get more complicated. Sadly, for better or for worse, that is what has transpired today. 
It was a dangerous time
Right after the end of the Second World War, when the Soviet Union began to be demonised and considered as the Enemy, down to the eighties and nineties, when the promise of a world free of bloodshed and conflict was aborted, despite the collapse of communism, by the commencement of the Gulf War, aggression was largely based on rhetoric, because both sides of the global polity knew, at least to an extent, that fighting against one another would mean suicide as far as they, and the world in general, were concerned. That is why we look back at the sixties and seventies as the era of James Bond fighting unseen global elites who want to flare up war between the Communists and the Free World so as to appropriate power for their members. As far as history, literature, and propaganda went, it was a dangerous time to live in, but it was also a nostalgic time, the time of spy novels, irresistible conspiracy theories, and the Profumo Affair. 
Obviously, the tactics, the strategies, and even the philosophy guiding the movement against the Global Left changed during the eighties. The West has, for whatever reason, been shy
about calling out its opponent in clear-cut, cohesive terms
Obviously, the tactics, the strategies, and even the philosophy guiding the movement against the Global Left changed during the eighties. The West has, for whatever reason, been shy about calling out its opponent in clear-cut, cohesive terms, which is why it tends to smother those opponents with politically correct slogans; the Evil Empire, Drugs, and of course Terror. As historians have pointed out, after all, even the American Civil War has been smothered with such feel-good slogans and labels (the best of them, and in fact the most mythical of them, being the War against Slavery) that people dont know the real intentions behind Lincolns campaign against the slaveholders. There was and is nothing different in the way the West, the Free World that is, sought to endear itself to nations that were springing out of communism and socialism. One way of suffocating the Global Left in this regard, therefore, was the empowerment of a Global Anti-Left. That came about in turn with the rise and institutionalisation of the NGO intelligentsia.
 
The New Left
This was the fatal contradiction at the heart of the Old Left; its susceptibility to the machinations of outside parties that had no interest, much less enthusiasm, about prolonging the leftist ideals it stood for. That contradiction was by and by the outcome of the discrepancy it reflected within itself between, as I mentioned last week, the stated aims of an equal society and the largely bourgeois ethic of the leadership it helped prop up. In Sri Lanka radicalism was, until the emergence of the New Left, limited to the saadukin pelena wun rhetoric of the Communists and Trotskyites, whose lasting achievements to the political sphere of this country cant be discounted (they were, after all, behind the drive this country tried to move with towards an industrialised society, something the colonial bourgeoisie could not attempt, much less achieve). Unfortunately with the dissolution of the Old Lefts credibility courtesy of the 1971 insurrection, it felt rather abandoned. It needed to make a comeback. That comeback came about when we substituted an ethnocentric project for a class-oriented one within the Left Movement.
Vijaya was the Southern politician that the North had been looking for, and he was the perfect foil to the then ascendant New Left, which as I observed last week was doing a pretty good job of being cultural nationalists and fervent Marxists

Hidden beneath the sloganeering of that movement was one key concept that the NGO intelligentsia was able to, inadvertently, pick up; the withering of the State. In Marxism that refers to the means by which a society of equals could be attained. It indicated an absence of not just class barriers, but also class consciousness, and it had to be preceded by a society that privileged the State as a necessary evil. What this meant, clearly enough, was that the State was always an instrument, and never an agent that could act on its own. When the intelligentsia intruded on the Left Movement in this country, it made use of this concept, or theory, and helped propel a private sphere that would remain independent of the State while making the State its primary instrument. The main channel through which this contortion could be realised was the Old Left, and the main method through which the Old Left could be made to yield to the contortion was the substitution of ethnicity for class. After 1956, after 1971, the single most significant political phenomenon in this country, for me therefore, is the emergence of the federalist-devolutionist discourse.
Vijaya Kumaratunga
The man chosen to head this movement was Vijaya Kumaratunga. There were several advantages to be gained by having Vijaya. Firstly, he was popular. He courted voters in both the South and the North, and at a time when Sinhala politicians were considered as parvenus by the top rung of the LTTE, he was amenable even to the likes of Prabhakaran. (The fact that his funeral was attended by members of the LTTE attests to this.) As I have pointed out elsewhere, he was adamant in considering the war against the Tamil Tigers a chauvinist government-led project against the Tamil people. For the supporters of the conflict, it was the only way through which centuries of inter-ethnic disparities could be corrected (this is true of the Sinhalese and the Tamil equally), but for the likes of Vijaya, it was nothing more than a jaathivadi yuddhayak, a term he used during a television interview. Vijaya was the Southern politician that the North had been looking for, and he was the perfect foil to the then ascendant New Left, which as I observed last week was doing a pretty good job of being cultural nationalists and fervent Marxists.
Liyanage Amarakeerthi in an otherwise critical piece on Gunadasa Amarasekara and the politics of the Jathika Chinthanaya contended that the problem with our political parties and the NGO sphere was their inability to produce engaging, original thinkers. With respect to the latter I think the problem goes deeper; the truth is that our NGO sphere has been unable thus far to produce an sincere enough thinker who can go beyond the monolingual elite and capture the hearts and minds of the monolingual masses and/or the bilingual middle class. They have failed to do so even today. A careful perusal of Susantha Goonetilakes book Recolonisation shows clearly that these intellectuals were well equipped with the language of the coloniser. But they couldnt acquaint themselves properly with the cultures they were involved with, Sinhala or Tamil. 
Amarakeerthi himself noted this: Writing mainly in English, they could not really reach out. This explains, to a considerable degree, the cynicism with which we regard those self-styled leftists academics, who write one piece after another justifying the policies of this Government and any Government that has supported their fundamentally flawed views on majoritarian hegemonies and chauvinism. I call them flawed not because they dont merit scrutiny  no one can deny that a hegemony based on Sinhala Buddhism does exist in Sri Lanka  but because they dont go beyond lambasting it by trying to find out reasons for the hegemony and its wide appeal among the people of this country. 
In Sri Lanka radicalism was, until the emergence of the New Left, limited to the saadukin pelena wun rhetoric of the Communists and Trotskyites, whose lasting achievements to the political sphere of this country cant be discounted
What happened after the bheeshanaya is interesting to reflect on. The Vijaya Kumaratunga Front (the United Socialist Alliance) collapsed almost immediately after the mans tragic murder at the hands of a New Left operative. The party that he and his wife had created congealed into an influential political movement, one that immediately forced the Old Left it had been associated with to be its vassal. Chandrika Kumaratunga, in what was seen as a landslide victory, swept into power promising change (based on the federalist-devolutionist discourse that the USA was premised on). Its a testament to her foresight, her vision, and her policies that not even two presidential terms by her then most serious contender from the SLFP, and a potential third (which didnt materialise), could erode her ideological sway. What we see today therefore is a return to that political discourse, though minus the Old Left, which has bifurcated between her (the Jayampathy Faction) and her erstwhile contender, Mahinda Rajapaksa (the Vasudeva Faction). 
Where this has led us to, and what it means for the New Left, I will explore next week.

University alcohol research: Colombo University says it was a personal study
	
Colombo University's Economics Department Head Ven. (Prof.) W. Wimalaratana Thera yesterday said the much talked-about alcohol research was a personal study done by an academic of the Colombo University even though he was attached to the university.
It was reported that government ministers were already claiming that they had used the said study as the basis to bring down taxes on beer in the Budget 2018.
Ven. Wimalaratana Thera told the Daily Mirror that the researchers attached to the university had the authority to conduct their own studies and added that this could be regarded as a personal and independent research carried out by a lecturer attached to the Colombo University.
However, there is no requirement of bringing a discussion on such sensitive matters through the budget since there is no need to create an issue out of it, the Thera added.
Meanwhile, the university's Economics Department Senior Lecturer Dr. Priyanga Dunusinghe, who carried out the said research on the illicit alcohol market in the country, said that it was an independent research done by him.
He admitted to carrying out this research and added it was an independent study. He also said it was not the Colombo University which had done the research even though he was attached to the university.
There is a miscommunication. It was saying that 49 per cent of the population in the country was consuming illicit liquor. It is wrong. According to the research conducted by me 49 per cent of the quantity of total alcohol market was illicit liquor, which is comparable with the data already published by the World Health Organisation (WHO) and several other sources, he added.
He said however, that 13 lakhs of people in the country were consuming illicit liquor moonshine while consuming arrack, toddy and beer as well and among them 4.5 lakhs of people were only consuming Moonshine.
I do not know whether the government has followed my research in the process of finalizing the prices of beer in the Budget 2018. I do not have any idea about it, he added. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)

UNP, SLPP, JVP oppose petition challenging LG Gazette
	
When the writ petition challenging the gazette notification of Provincial Councils and Local Government Minister Faizer Musthapah was taken up in the Court of Appeal yesterday (16), several parties namely UNP, Pothujana Peramuna, JVP, PAFFREL, Caffe, and Eksath Jathika Nidhahas Peramuna indicated their intention to intervene to oppose the original Petition.
The Bench comprising Justices L.T.B.Dehideniya (President/CA), Kumudini Wickramasinghe and A.L.S.Gooneratne directed them to file their papers on Monday (20) to consider whether to allow or not allow their intervention.
The Attorney General yesterday raised preliminary objection on the maintainability of the Writ Petition seeking to quash the decision of the Minister of Provincial Council & Local Government Faizer Musthapha.
Pursuant to certain purported recommendations of the five member National Delimitation Committee headed by its chairman Ashoka Peiris, the Minister has by Gazette notification dated l7th February 2017 effected the amendments by amending the boundaries, number of members and the constituent parts of wards in respect of the Local Authorities.
Deputy Solicitor General Arjuna Obeysekera appearing for the Respondents the Minister and the Ministry Secretary raised objections on the ground time limit that the petition has been filed after 9 months and the petitioners had no locus standi (the right or ability to bring a legal action to a court of law, or to appear in a court), there is no necessary parties in the petition namely Election Commission etc.
The Court fixed its order for November 22 on issuing Notices as well as on the intervenient petitioners.
Petitioners W.D.G.Wijeratne (Kandy District), T.Sirisena Fernando (Colombo District), R.K.M.Karunatilake Kumara ( Kurunegala District), D.K.Ariyaratne( Badulla District), J.K.Rajapaksha Senadheera( Ratnapura District), P.H.Yohan Dhanushka (Matara District) cited Minister and the Ministry Secretary as Respondents.
Petitioners said the legislature has sought to amend the manner in which members are elected to local authorities and introduce a new electoral system which is a mixed system comprising elements of a single majority ( i.e. first past the post) and proportional systems.
They state the legislature has added another aspect to the electoral process pertaining to the election of members to Local Authorities whereby certain guarantees are imposed on the election of female representatives.
The said status required a comprehensive national delimitation process which was necessary for the demarcation of all local authorities into distinct wards and to determine the number of members that could be elected.
The President by gazette notification dated 21st August 2015 has published the number of wards, the boundaries, names, number alphabetical letter in English assigned to each ward so create on the recommendations of the National Delimitation Committee in respect of the local authorities throughout the Island, they state.
The Minister of Local Government & Provincial Councils is vested with the power to cause an alteration to be made to the boundaries of the wards as published in terms of the Local Authorities Act, they state.
Such alterations are required to be made on the recommendations of a Committee consisting of five persons appointed by the Minister, they state.
Consequent to the publication of the gazette notification dated 21st August 2017, the Minister had ostensibly appointed a Committee to ostensibly effect the alterations to boundaries of ward, they lament.
Pursuant to certain purported recommendation of the Committee, the Minister has by gazette notification dated 17th February 2017 has effected purported amendments, they state.
They bemoan several wards in Colombo and Kandy Municipal Councils as well as Kotapola,Panduwasnuwara, Haliela and Empilipitiya Pradeshiya Sabhas which were designated as Multi-member wards have been re-designated as wards which only elect one member and other several wards which elected only one member have been re-designated as Multi-Member wards.
They blame the Minister had made alterations to the number of members elected from ward in many local authorities throughout the Island.
They contend the Minister is not empowered to cause any alteration to the number of members and the boundaries of wards. They allege the Minister has acted ultra vires(beyond his powers) and without jurisdiction.
They seeks the Court to quash the decision of the Minister contained in the Gazette notification dated 17th February 2017 and suspend the operation of the said gazette notification until the final determination. (S.S.Selvanayagam)

Woman with Buddha tattoo abused on Facebook
	
The British woman who was deported from Sri Lanka for having a tattoo of Buddha on her arm saidshe had to leave Facebook after being abused by extremists, the BBC reported today.
The 41-year-old Naomi Colemanfrom Coventry won compensation on Wednesday after being detained in the country for four days, in April 2014.
Ms Coleman, a Buddhist herself, said she will not return to Sri Lanka.
Following her deportation, she says she received online messages telling her she should die and burn in hell.
"I have never experienced anything like this with Buddhism.They mostly seemed to be sent from Buddhist extremists in Sri Lanka. They were writing that I should die and burn in hell.I came completely off Facebook for a few weeks and have now changed my name on social media. To me, this is not the Buddhist way. Buddhism is about compassion and understanding,she said.
On Wednesday, theSupreme Court said Ms.Coleman's treatment while she was in custody was "scandalous and horrifying" and awarded her compensation of 800,000 Sri Lankan rupees - about 4,000.
It said there was "no legal basis" for her arrest and she had been subject to "degrading treatment" by some officers and a prison guard.
Ms Coleman, who has been a Buddhist for about 10 years, has travelled widely and continues to go to retreats in Thailand and Nepal.
She said she was "overwhelmed" by the ruling but would not be returning to Sri Lanka.
"It's a shame - it's a beautiful country and most of the people are very welcoming.However, it seems there is a small percentage of people who want to cause trouble for me. I'm not sure if it's because I am a woman travelling alone. But, at the moment, I wouldn't feel safe going back," she said.
