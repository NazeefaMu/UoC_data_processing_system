'G.L, a minister in Prabha's government'
	
Justice Minister Wijayadasa Rajapakse today alleged that if there was a government led by LTTE Leader Velupillai Prabhakaran, former minister G.L. Peiris would try to be a minister in it as well.
Speaking at a media briefing held at the UNP Headquarters, Sirikotha, he said MP Peiris along with several politically displaced persons were involved in a futile exercise to sabotage government?s actions because they might have understood that they would not be given nominations at the next general elections.
?Professor Peiris is misleading people by giving wrong information about the no-faith motion against Premier Wickremesinghe. We all want to dissolve parliament soon. If someone knows the meaning of democracy, he will not behave like him,? Minister Rajapaksa said.
He alleged that Prof. Peiris would have kept mum, if he had been given a ministerial portfolio in the present government by President Maithripala Sirisena.
He challenged MP G.L. Peiris to come into a live television debate with him over the facts in the no confidence motion against the Prime Minister.
Speaking about former president Mahinda Rajapaksa's politics at temples, the Justice Minister said it would cause destruction of Buddhism and Buddhist devotees would hesitate to go to temples for their religious activities. (Piyumi Fonseka)

Government would not act on no-confidence motion: Wijeyadasa
	
Government would not take any action on the no-confidence motion signed by 112 Parliamentarians against Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, Justice Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakse said today.
?Opposition?s motion would not be taken up for Parliamentary debate, since the UNP based government was authorised to decide whether to take action on it or not,? he said.
?Even a grade two child is able to guess the result if the motion is taken up in Parliament, where the Opposition has the majority,? Mr. Rajapaksa said.
He said the no-confidence motion was useless because President Maithripala had vowed to dissolve Parliament soon.
?The government has acknowledged that 20th Amendment to the Constitution would not get passed if the disruptive behaviour of some Parliamentarians, who are joined with former President Mahinda Rajapaksa?s political campaign continues,? he said.
However, he said they would allow and support once the Opposition votes in favour to the 20th Amendment.
Speaking about the allegations levelled against the Prime Minister, Mr. Rajapaksa said President Sirisena had earlier said in his manifesto that Ranil Wickremensinghe would be appointed as the Prime Minister. Accordingly, people voted for President Sirisena and opposition?s attempts to unseat the Prime Minister were not appropriate.
He also urged all Parliamentarians to support to get 20th Amendment passed soon without hoodwinking the people. (Piyumi Fonseka)

I had a clear mandate to become PM -Ranil
	
Responding to one of the charges made in the no-confidence motion against him -- that he had become the Premier through the back door -- Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said today that he had accepted the post following a clear mandate .
Addressing a meeting in Galgamuwa, Mr Wickremesinghe said he became Prime Minister through the front door and when he retires from politics would leave through the same door.
He said those who were bringing the no-confidence motion against him were trying to grab power without a mandate. "These MPs are trying to form a government without a mandate and they don't have the right to do so as the people gave me the mandate to become Prime Minister on January 9," he said. He said these MPs would have been in the wilderness today if Parliament was dissolved on January 9, immediately after the presidential election.
Mr Wickremesinghe reiterated his call for the dissolution of Parliament without delay. "There are some MPs who are playing about using the oxygen supplied by President Maithripala Sirisena, and I request Mr. Sirisena to cut this supply of oxygen,? he said.
The Prime Minister also stressed the need for a new Parliament that would effectively resolve all the issues faced by the people. He said he would be able to return to power with the support of the southern voters. We will emerge strong after the general elections and fulfil the aspirations of the people," he said.

JVP calls for setting up of CC
	
The Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) today called for the setting up of the Constitutional Council without the three civil society members stating that there is provision for such a situation in the 19th Amendment.
JVP Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake said parties should discuss this situation as it is an essential move.
Mr. Dissanayake said it is essential that the Constitutional Council is set up before going for the elections. However, he accepted the fact that the CC would be more independent if the non-politically affiliated civil members are also appointed.
Further, he said the Constitutional Council, if set up could appoint another Commissioner to the Bribery Commission in place of the one who had resigned and thereby give life to it. The JVP leader said the Bribery Commission has come to a standstill halting all investigations on complaints against former rulers including 20 ministers of the previous cabinet.
He charged that both President and the Prime Minister are following a lethargic approach just for their political gains. "The President is following such an approach to delay or completely halt the investigations on UPFA politicians so that he could woo them to his camp while Prime Minister is following a similar approach so that pro Rajapaksa camp of the UPFA could become strong and create a division among the SLFP? he said stressing that both should understanding the danger of the game they are playing.

LTTE leader?s wife asks Karunanidhi to break silence on surrender issue
	
	Ananthy Sasistharan, wife of a senior functionary of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), on Saturday urged Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) president M. Karunanidhi and his daughter and MP, Kanimozhi, to break their silence on their role on the issue of surrender of LTTE members to the Sri Lankan security forces in May 2009.
	In an interview with The Hindu , Ms. Sasitharan, now a member of the Northern Provincial Council (NPC), claimed that ?it was after his conversation with Ms. Kanimozhi in Mullivaikkal at about 8 p.m. on May 16, 2009, my husband chose to surrender himself to the forces. This is not the first time that I am saying this. So far, there has been no response from the other side.? It is time Karunanidhi Ayya and Ms. Kanimozhi break their silence and tell the world who were all behind the entire episode.?
	Asked if her husband had any other option, the NPC member said, ?He might have taken cyanide pills as he had two.? However, she said she was not aware of the instructions of the LTTE to its members in such an eventuality. ?
	On Thursday, she deposed before the Mullativu District Court in connection with a habeas corpus petition filed by her, seeking the authorities to produce her husband, who is also known as Ezhilan and LTTE political commissar for Trincomalee at the time of surrender.? In the court too, she had referred to the conversation between her husband and Ms. Kanimozhi.
	Giving her account of events that took place in May 2009, the NPC member, who maintained that she had never been a member of the LTTE,? said that she was present when her husband spoke over a satellite phone to Ms. Kanimozhi, who, according to her, represented her father. ?After the talk, he told me that she had told him to surrender and she had also assured him of release, as talks were in progress at the international level,? Ms Sasitharan said.
	At around 8 a.m on May 18, near Mullativu District Secretariat, her husband surrendered to the security forces in the presence of a Catholic priest and he was followed by hundreds of LTTE members.? Ms. Sasitharan and her three children witnessed the surrender. Later, they left for Vavuniya.? [The same? day, LTTE chief V. Prabakaran was killed by the Sri Lankan Army]
	?The NPC member said the surrender involving her husband was different from another surrender which was generally known and which took place on the same day. The latter case pertained to LTTE senior functionaries B. Nadesan and S. Pulithevan.

Present govt?s corruption led to the no-confidence motion: MR
	
	Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa says it is the ?blatant falsehoods, corruption and persecution of the opponents? by the incumbent government that resulted in the no-confidence motion against Prime Minister Ranil Wickramasinghe.
	In a statement, MR has noted that it is probably for the first time in the history of the Westminster parliamentary tradition that such a large number of MPs have signed a no-confidence motion but has added that it is hardly a surprise, due to the ?unethical conduct? of the government.
	MR has also gone on to respond to a claim made by the PM last week, in which he had alleged that a sum of Rs. 28 billion that was obtained by the Highways Ministry and remains unaccounted for, must have been exploited by MR for his helicopter rides and to provide free meals to the public.
	In his statement the former President has further noted on PM?s allegations against him, that this short-term NSB loan was used to pay Rs. 6.5 billion as the local component of 22 foreign funded projects which included the Outer Circular Highway and the UK Steel Bridge project etc.
	?Some Rs. 14 billion of it was spent on road widening and improvement, another Rs. 4 billion on maintenance and repair of bridges and the final Rs. 3.7 billion on Maganeguma rural road projects. The prime minister was not speaking the truth when he said that this Rs. 28 billion had been used for purposes other than building roads,? MR has further emphasized in his statement.
