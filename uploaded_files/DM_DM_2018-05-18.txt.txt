Britain could stay in EU customs union after 2020
	

UK, (Daily Mail;), 17 May 2018 - Theresa May was forced to deny caving into the EU today as Brexiteers voiced fury over ministers agreeing that Britain could stay tied to the customs union
beyond 2020.
Mrs May dismissed claims of an abject surrender after it emerged her war Cabinet has signed off on an extension as part of a backstop that would avoid a hard Irish border if no other solutions are found.Mrs May wants to table the proposals before a key EU summit next month, in an effort to kick-start progress towards a trade deal. 
Irish PM Leo Varakdar - who is holding talks with Mrs May at a summit in Sofia later - upped the pressure this morning by warning that negotiations could collapse altogether unless there is movement on the border issue. Mrs May has repeatedly pledged that the UK will leave the customs union in 2020.

Civilians killed in the war remembered in Wellamulliwaikkal
	
Some 5,000 people attended the ceremony of remembrance held at Wellamulliwaikkal on Friday to commemorate those killed in the armed conflict.
It was held at the monument erected at Wellamulliwaikkal-East in honour of the civilians killed in the war.
The ceremony began with the lighting of a lamp by a girl who lost her parents and three brothers during the war and Northern Province Chief Minister C.V. Wigneswaran.
Although several politicians including members of the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) were invited to the commemoration ceremony held last year, none of them expect for the chief minister was invited to this years ceremony organised by the Northern Provincial Council.
According to reports, the Jaffna University students federation which had pledged its support to the commemoration ceremony had opposed the participation of politicians.
The ceremony began by observing three-minute silence and the lighting of oil lamps to invoke blessings on the deceased.
The Chief Minister addressed those who were gathered there. (Romesh Madushanka)

Civilians who died in the war should also be remembered: PM
	
While commemorating the security forces who sacrificed their lives, all civilians who lost their lives from the day the war began should also be remembered during the war heroes day, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said.
He said this at the opening of the 'Build Sri Lanka 2013' exhibition in Colombo today.
Today is an important day for Sri Lanka as the country is commemorating the end of the war and the emergence of peace. We will also remember the security forces personnel who sacrificed their lives the civilians who died during the armed conflict, he said.
Minister Sajith Premadasa said the War Heroes Day is held to pay tribute to the security forces personnel who sacrificed their lives in the exercise of defeating terrorism. "This government will do its utmost for the war heroes and address all their needs, Mr. Premadasa said. (Yohan Perera)

Democracy development or development democracy
	

Somewhere in the middle of the last century, Marxist scholars, disillusioned by the sanguine hopes they had placed on the public, began writing negatively of the working class. This grim assessment of the proletariat and the peasantry was the basis for some of the monumental works of post-Nazi Germany social theory: Richard Hofstadters thesis that the masses were anti-intellectual, C. Wright Mills thesis that they were bureaucratic, and, perhaps the most grim and important of them all, Hannah Arendts thesis that they were unwitting supporters of totalitarianism. To argue that these writers and their books formed the bedrock of how the West continues to look at the working class, not just in their part of the world, but also our part of the world, would be an understatement. If there was no Hitler, no Mussolini, plainly put, there would have been no Hannah Arendt and no Origins of Totalitarianism. But to suggest that these theories work out well for the peasantry and the proletariat for this part of the world is, I think, rather self-deluding. 

	"The East, particularly in countries like Sri Lanka, has years and decades of colonialism and exploitation at the hands of the West
	
	
	We have been cheated again and again by a specific class of politicians"
	
My friend Michael Patrick OLeary once quipped that the road to hell is paved with false analogies, paraphrasing that saying about it being paved with good intentions. This is true of the way we view demagogues in the East on the basis of how they are viewed in the West. Sri Lanka is no exception to this; time after time, we have been told, explicitly of course, that demagoguery is the last refuge of the scoundrel, much like nationalism and patriotism, and that the demagogue frequently resorts to false promises so as to bring in more votes. This one way transfer, as Id like to call it, belittles the people who have been promised various things and promotes the vested interests that tend to gather around the demagogue after s/he wins an election. Given this, whats wrong with considering those voters as the covert supporters of totalitarianism they were touted as by Arendt et al 
Simply this: the East, particularly in countries like Sri Lanka, has years and decades of colonialism and exploitation at the hands of the West which the West does not have. In the West demagoguery is negative, so negative that even when it does occur (as in the case of Trumps America) or almost occurs (as in the case of Le Pens France), the checks and balances offsetting the externalities of that kind of demagoguery prove to be useful. But thats because these countries have enough and more of what we had, and what we dont: resources. If were desperate for totalitarians, if we seem to be covert sympathisers of dictators, and if we appear to be sleeping with the fishes (to borrow another phrase) by voting against our own interests in the form of neo-fascist leaders, its not because we dont know the meaning of democracy, or totalitarianism, or leadership, but rather because were tired of leaders who privilege the ideological over the economic. We want democracy, we want ethic harmony, but we also want food on the table. And for an awful lot of people in this side of the planet, getting that food on that table is pretty hard. 
Cheated by politicians
So if we the people are not We, the People of the American Constitution, its simply because we have been cheated again and again by a specific class of politicians who dither on the issues they promise to resolve once they come to power. We saw this in 1978 and we saw this in 1994 and we are seeing this now. The reason why we did not see this in 2005 was because the leader elected then, democratically, remained the only leader who did well on the one issue he promised to resolve. But as time went by, the war proved to be too much of an asset, a national treasure in fact, to bandy about for the sake of self-perpetuation. There needed to be another set of issues, mainly economic, which the Rajapaksa administration could show as being resolved by them. A bubble economy of consumption came up after 2010 owing to their need to show the people that we were more of a nation of development democracy than one of democracy development. The mandate in 2010 was for that sort of polity. The sort that was doomed to burst some day. Thats another story though. 
What is often forgotten is that the fear of the masses the West has sustained was largely an offshoot, not of the complicity of ordinary Germans in the Third Reich, but of the culture of distrust the intellectual centre created when it came to the relationship between the State and its subjects. Western liberal democracy was hardly liberal or democratic in the early days. It was the joint outcome of years and decades and centuries of sustained exploitation of slaves and the working class. John Lockes contentions about liberalism are at odds with his view of the sanctity of property because liberalism, which privileged the individual, needed at the same time a strong, authoritarian State. The State oversaw the exploitation of those subjects who continue to be erased out of the liberal narratives which are spawned by the successors of Locke and Mills and Bentham today. When liberalism was nonexistent in the early days of conflicts over land, the State needed a higher figure in the form of an unseen deity (Hobbess Leviathan). When Europe underwent the Reformation and turned towards rationalism, property became the new God, and the object of the State was to counter any act against the ownership of land. 
What Good Governance lacked
But private property has been, throughout much of history, the source of the Wests exploitation of colonies and slaves. It has also, ironically, been the source of those liberal narratives I have alluded to. Land is simultaneously a harbinger of totalitarianism (for the masses) and of democracy (for the elite). Arendts suspicions of the general public, the people, were the suspicions of the Founding Fathers of the United States too. In that sense, the post-Nazi Germany universe merely compounded this culture of suspicion and distrust, creeping into the many organisations created (ostensibly) to preserve world peace or export democracy. The West has, given this, always preferred the individual to the collective, and it has historically believed in at least nominal democracy development over development democracy in our part of the world because it believes that what works for them will somehow work for us. That is not the case, and the West, even after Korea, Vietnam, Afghanistan, and Iraq, has obviously not corrected this vicious misconception. 

	"A bubble economy of consumption came up after 2010
	
	
	Western liberal democracy was hardly liberal or democratic in the early days
	
	
	Sri Lankas polity, come 2020, will thus be in shambles"
	
Sri Lankas polity, come 2020, will thus be in shambles. Development democracy and democracy development are and have always been ill-fitted for each other here. Those who hedged their bets on the new administration after 2015, tragically, thought that the masses could be swayed on the basis of its allegiance to the tenets of good governance and sanhindiyawa. But the problem with this project was that you cannot focus on good governance without a strong bulwark. Mahinda Rajapaksa and his cohorts committed the opposite mistake: they delivered the goods, but failed to secure those goods for the longer term, and that by cracking down on dissent at every step of the way. Once these goods were taken over by their successors, of the yahapalana administration, they were doomed to rot, because for them to flourish, they needed to be preserved by a strong, at times even authoritarian centre.
This authoritarian centre is precisely what is lacking in the new government, and it is the demand for that centre which compelled the majority, even those who had supported Maithripala Sirisena previously, to oust him from power at the grassroots level last February. The demand in 2015 had been for change: unyielding, unconditional. That demand continues, but now it is for a reversal: a 360-turnaround to the authoritarian, centrist, anti-peripheral development democracy of 2014 and before.

Dont use war heroes for personal agendas: Army Chief
	
War heroes must not be manipulated to serve narrow objectives and personal agendas, nor should they be incited to resort to emotional and anti-social acts, Army Commander Mahesh Senanayake said.
Lieutenant General Senanayake said nine years have passed since the eradication of terrorism from the country and he firmly believed the freedom thus gained should be shared not by exaggerated glorification or through mere rhetoric and hyperbole but by showing our sentiments of deep gratitude to fallen war heroes and civilians who rooted terrorism out.
In a statement issued in connection with the National War Heroes' Day, the Commander said many numbers of fearless war heroes during the course of 30 years sacrificed their valuable lives, sweat and blood to decide on our future.
More than 28,000 security personnel made the supreme sacrifice in defence of the motherland, thus enabling all Sri Lankans to enjoy the present day's spirits of freedom.
They all sighed their last breath to the air on that day, expecting ever-lasting bonds of peace and reconciliation would prevail,the Army Commander said.

Facebook launches initiative to improve Digital Literacy in Sri Lanka
	
Advent of the digital economy has helped improve access to services and information where traditional channels have not been able to deliver. Reinforcing its commitment towards improving digital literacy in Sri Lanka, Facebook has announced the launch of a Digital Literacy Program. The program in partnership with Sarvodaya Fusion's IT Yahamaga initiative in Sinhala and Tamil underscores Facebook's mission of giving people the power to build communities. As part of the program, 20,000 school and university students will be educated over a 1- year period.
The program will include students from across different community groups in Colombo, Jaffna, Kurunegala, Puttalam, Matara, Hambantota, Anuradhapura, Nuwara Eliya, Monaragala, Batticaloa, Trincomalee and Ratnapura. The interactive training sessions will include training on safe and responsible use of the internet and contains topics that teach online users on how to think critically online, and effectively identify credible information from questionable information.
It also includes empathy as a key value to express online with the aim of not just creating a safer and informed community but one that embraces perspectives and respects differences of opinion.
Speaking at the launch of the program, Ankhi Das, Public Policy Director - India, South & Central Asia - <U+200E>Facebook said, Our mission is to give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together. We believe that when we share information and connect, we achieve extraordinary things. In a young nation like Sri Lanka, with over 5 million Facebook users, whats really needed is a raised awareness about the potential of the internet and the need to remain safe while being online. When this happens, we will see more meaningful and profound online experiences which will ultimately benefit the nation and its economy while strengthening its social fabric
Maithree Malwattegoda, General Manager, Sarvodaya Fusion, added, We are delighted with this collaboration with Facebook as it will go a long way in enhancing digital literacy in Sri Lanka. It is important that we make sure that we are putting the right intervention to address the responsible usage of internet.

Gaza massacre: Distorted scriptures, Zionist goons and daddys little ghoul
	
The Nakba Day massacre and the grotesque ceremony to mark the opening of the United States embassy in Jerusalem turned Monday, May 14, into one of the darkest days in recent history.
Television footage of the massacre reminded us of the Jallianwala Bagh massacre 99 years ago at Amritsar in British India. The two massacres had many parallels, but one that is most disgusting is that the perpetrators had no remorse. General Reginald Dyer, who gave orders to his troops to open fire at the unarmed Punjabi protesters, died unrepentant and his only regret was that he did not have time to kill more.
The Israelis were unrepentant, too. Mondays death toll of more than 60 brought the number of Palestinians killed from March 30 to more than 100. On March 30, the Gaza Strips Palestinians, living in abject poverty, began their Great March of Return for a sit-in protest on the border. Killing Palestinians is no sin, for they are not humans, according to Zionist hardliners, including deputy defence minister Eli Ben Dahan. Israel and its American supporters will not shed a tear even if a million Palestinians are killed. This desensitization process began even prior to the setting up of Israel. Israel was founded on the deaths of thousands of Palestinians and the ethnic cleansing of more than 750,000 Palestinians. Rarely is this horror story highlighted in the Israeli-friendly corporate media, under whose spell we have come into. We let our thoughts to be shaped by the corporate medias propaganda aimed at promoting the evil designs of the Zionists, the capitalists and the agents of war, also known as the arms industry. Global justice activists insist that such stories need to be told and retold. Otherwise, evil will thrive in the silence of the good people. One such less spoken about stories in the corporate media is the Deir Yassin massacre.
Just before the dawn on April 9, 1948, armed members of the Zionist terrorist gang Irgun, headed by Menachem Begin who later became Israels Prime Minister, and the terror group Stern Gang raided the Palestinian village of Deir Yassin, inhabited by some 750 Palestinians. The village on a high ground overlooking Jerusalem lay just outside the United Nations drawn partition line. The villagers were ordered to leave. When they resisted, the terrorists killed more than 125 people. Similar massacres took place in Jaffa and other places in the run-up to Israels declaration of Independence on May 14, 1948. From 1947 to 1949, some 750,000 Palestinians were expelled from their villages. In the Palestinian annals, the tragedy is called Al-Nakba or the Catastrophe. The Palestinians who lost their homes still live in refugee camps or are scattered all over the world. Every year on Nakba Day, they hold high their corroding house keys for the world to see. Their history has been erased. As George Orwell said, the past was erased, the erasure was forgotten, the lie became the truth.
The charade continues. In Zionist narrations, the oppressor, a nuclear power, is presented as the oppressed, injustice is portrayed as justice and freedom fighters are branded as terrorists. No wonder, the US President Donald Trump kills the peace process and calls his action a great push for peace. At the Jerusalem embassy opening ceremony, boycotted even by the United States allies, Trumps Zionist son-in-law Jared Kushner, without any moral compunction, accused the Palestinians of being part of the problem and said the journey to peace started with a strong America recognising the truth.
For the Zionists, the injustice caused to the Palestinians does not construe the truth. For them, the truth is that Jews are the chosen people of God and Jerusalem is the eternal capital of the Jews. With Judaism being hijacked by hardline Zionists from Europe to achieve political ends, such misinterpretation of the scriptures is repeated. American evangelicals who adore the criminal Zionists say there is a God-given foreign policy which America needs to follow. Quoting from Genesis, they say, Whoever blesses Israel will be blessed, and whoever curses Israel will be cursed. But they seem to have overlooked the fact that Jesus called them the faithless and perverse generation.
The evangelicals need to be asked that if Jesus were to come today, on whose side will he be. Will he be with the oppressed Palestinians or oppressor Israel Those who say that Zionists are Gods chosen people are committing blasphemy, for they make God a god of apartheid, a god of injustice, a god who encourages discriminatory practices. Trump is part of this Zionist-Evangelical axis, which has sold Gods commandments for justice  you shall not covert your neighbours property -- for 30 silver coins.
At the Jerusalem embassy opening ceremony  a clear violation of International law -- were those who financed his White House campaign in 2016. Among them was Casino mogul Sheldon Adelson, who prodded Trump to shift the embassy to Jerusalem. Then there was Southern Baptist Pastor Robert Jeffress who has repeatedly said that divine providence has a hand in Trumps election and that God has authorised Trump to do, basically, whatever he wants.
As the celebrations went on in Jerusalem, there was little pity for those who were being killed, just 70 km away in Gaza. Dancing on the dead bodies of Palestinian children was Trumps daughter Ivanka. The New York Daily News, a liberal newspaper, aptly described her in a page one headline as the Daddys Little Ghoul for her obscene indifference to the killing of Palestinians by Israel, whom her father described as a country that, like the United States, believes in human rights and democracy.
Imagine a massacre of this magnitude had taken place in Iran, Syria or Sri Lanka. There would have been worldwide outrage with calls for international probe. At the UN Security Council emergency meeting on Tuesday, US envoy Nikki Haley blamed Iran and Hamas for the deaths of the Palestinians. She was reminded by the Bolivian envoy that the problem was simply Israels illegal occupation of Palestine.
Yes, that is the root cause of the problem. It is a shame that in the 21st century, the United States, the greatest democracy on earth, has become part of the Zionist colonial project. Until the US frees itself from the clutches of Zionism, the Palestinians freedom will remain elusive.

Hackers transfer US$13 mn from businessmen via emails: CERT
	
The Computer Emergency Readiness Team | Co-ordination Centre (CERT|CC) said yesterday they had received complaints about fraudsters hacking into email accounts of businessmen and transferring funds worth more than US$13 million during past five months.
CERT|CC Principal Information Security Engineer Roshan Chandragupta said many people had fallen prey to one of the latest techniques where peoples accounts were hacked. They have been requested to change their bank account details due to a change of supplier details.
Many victims of this scam have suffered huge losses. The fraudsters learn from stolen emails the transactions between the seller and consignor as well as the buyer and paying company. Masquerading as the company, these fraudsters later generate emails requesting their client to credit the amount payable to a new account, claiming that the email address and payment receiving bank account number have been changed. It is only when the buyer contacts the bank that he or she finds they have been deceived. Recipients of these fictitious emails should be cautious as they look genuine. They should be careful when exchanging confidential details via emails. If anyone receives such emails, it is advisable to contact the bank or seller to verify.
Mr. Chandragupta requested people to be vigilant with what was said in the email conversations and to keep update usual contacts with the recipients ordinary telephone numbers.
There were some who felt suspicious over their incoming emails. They had made telephone calls to the relevant recipients or the companies about the suspicious emails and managed to save their money, he said. People always should keep in mind to read the contents of their received email. The email addresses cannot be duplicated but making small changes such as changing a letter can make email addresses lookalike with the originals.
Mr. Chandragupta said some people check their emails after the goods ordered were not received and call the telephone numbers they had earlier contacted but by then it was too late and all the payments have been made. (Chaturanga Samarawickrama)

He is kept down for the other to be up
	

A certain prominent purohita is said to have made a desperate appeal to his boss not to offer a deputy or state level subject to a very popular Diyawanna member in his district.

This Diyawanna member is reportedly much more popular in the district than the purohita who has got his high office thanks to his being in the good books of his boss.
The purohita had frankly told his boss that the popular Diyawanna member getting any high office would be a big threat to his political future, they say.
Thus, the hard-working popular member for whom a high office at whatever level could be a leverage for a much better performance for the good of the people, had been overlooked at the latest reshuffle at well, they say.

Health hazards posed by automated kitchens
	

In the past our ancestors paid more attention to their diets because it provides energy for the day-to-day physical activities. Many generations ago preparing of tasty and healthy meals for the family was a major role played by women. But with the passing of time, the increasing of the population and urbanization taking place, lifestyles of people have changed rapidly. Out of all these urban growth has had a huge effect on their lifestyles and also added to the cost of living. As a result housewives also have to make contributions to the family income by doing jobs during their spare time. Therefore due to these competitive and busy lifestyles, the main role of housewives is changing constantly. As of now they need to prepare food within a short period of time if they are to manage all their activities for the day. This doesnt give them an opportunity to think about taste and nutrition when cooking. As a result most of housewives are looking for modern kitchen accessories which provide for efficient cooking and saving time. Though cooking time is reduced with these accessories their busy lifestyles have cut the time thats available for cooking. Now conventional techniques are less used in the kitchen. People have replaced their traditional feeding habits with globalized food preparation patterns. But unfortunately, we are not interested in finding out the adverse effects of these modernized food preparation techniques on our health. Most of our urbanized kitchens are fully automated with various kinds of food processing utensils which help to prepare food in a short time. However, current innovations in the food production sector may have negative effects on the nutritional quality of food and create long-term health concerns. 
With the development of food science and technology, various types of contemporary kitchen equipment are introduced to our society as an innovative alternatives for our conventional cooking devices. Some of these equipment are the microwave oven, gas cooker, hot plate, rice cooker, pressure cooker, toaster, deep freezer, grinder, mixer etc. While these innovations are designed with profit in mind, they dont ensure that the food cooked is tasty or has nutrition. This article discusses in general the two different modern food technologies presently used, their effects on the quality of food thats made and safety. 

Microwave oven
Nowadays microwave ovens are very popular home appliances used for the purpose of processing food. Food cooked in the microwave oven gets heated due to the presence of an alternating electromagnetic field. Once the microwave energy is absorbed, polar molecules and ions inside the food will rotate or collide according to the alternating electromagnetic field and heat is subsequently generated within the food through a series of molecular vibration. However in the conventional oven heat is applied to the outside of food by convection. 

Possible risks associate with microwave cooking
1.Loss of organoleptic properties in the food - The microwave oven cannot induce browning or crisping of food. During microwave baking, significant changes in physicochemical properties of dough can happen. Many studies have been done to address various issues related to microwave baking like texture, low volume, lack of color, formation of crust, more dehydration and rapid staling. 
2. Loss of nutrient- Research studies have compared microwave-cooked meat with conventionally-cooked meat and indicate that beef, pork roasts, chops or patties cooked in microwave ovens usually have been subject to a loss in nutrition. Food cooked using a microwave oven is also less tender and drier. Early research indicates that meat cooked in microwave ovens was low in quality compared to meat cooked using conventional methods. Also a mild reduction in vitamin levels was observed (usually a loss of vitamin C) when food is prepared using a microwave oven instead of using conventional cooking methods. Furthermore, a Russian research reported that there was a decreased bioavailability of vitamin B complex, vitamin C, vitamin E, essential minerals and lipotropic factors during microwave cooking. 
3.Risk of carcinogenic substance production -Russian studies have discovered the formation of Nitrosodiethanolamines (carcinogenic substance) when preparing meat using a microwave ovens. And also when heating milk and cereal grans using a microwave oven, certain amino acids have been converted into carcinogens. 
4. Risk of chemical leakage from the package into the food - The leakage of numerous toxic chemicals could occur from the heat-susceptors in packaging in common microwavable foods such as pizzas, french fries, popcorn etc. Microwave ovens cannot make food brown and crispy or crunchy. However, this issue can be resolved by using microwave packaging materials called microwave susceptors when heating food. The most common susceptors are made of polyester film with particulate aluminium and paper or board. The aluminium layer can absorb microwaves and warm quickly making the food crispy. 
5.Health concerns- According to research studies, an increase in the rates of stomach and intestinal cancers have been observed. In addition to that there is a decrease in all hemoglobin and cholesterol values, especially the ratio of HDL (good cholesterol) and LDL (bad cholesterol) values. Moreover, white blood cells showed a more distinct short-term decline following the intake of microwaved food when compared to the intake of all other foods. 
6. Radiation hazard  If the door of the microwave oven does not fit well or if it is damage, microwave radiation may leak out. If there is a long-term human exposure to microwave radiation, it may contribute to genetic mutation, disorders and cancers. These are known as microwave sicknesses. According to Russian scientists, the first signs are low blood pressure and slow pulse. Then it manifests to chronic excitation of the sympathetic nervous system (stress syndrome) and high blood pressure. In this phase, headache, dizziness, eye pain, sleeplessness, irritability, anxiety, stomach pain, nervous tension, inability to concentrate, hair loss, increased incidence of appendicitis, cataracts, reproductive problems, and cancer can occur. Eventually these chronic symptoms are succeeded by coronary heart disease (blockage of coronary arteries which leads to a heart attack). 

Toaster
When starchy food is cooked at high temperatures, like when roasting, acrylamide is formed by Maillard reaction. This occurs due to the reaction between amino acids and sugars within starchy food. This acrylamide is a natural by-product thats developed during high temperature cooking and results in the browning of the food or non-enzymatic browning and provides additional colour, aromas and flavours to food. Acrylamide is recognized as a toxic compound. According to animal studies that have been conducted, the regular consumption of food that contains high levels of acrylamide can increase the risks of cancer and damage the nervous and reproductive systems. During our bodys detoxification metabolism, acrylamide can be bound to glutathione, before being eliminated from the body. Alternatively, it can be activated by metabolism to glycidamide, which can be bound to DNA leading to mutations. This is most likely to be the cause of cancer. The effects on the neurological and reproductive system are more likely to be due to acrylamide itself, rather than the presence of glycidamide metabolite. 
Conclusively, modern technology and food science have developed faster resulting in more efficient ways of cooking food. Nowadays with these busy lifestyles, most of us do not have considerable time to spend in preparing healthy, balanced and nutritious meals. Hence, all of us are looking for novel food preparation technologies since there are huge advantages when using modern food preparation appliances. However, these modern cooking technologies may adversely effect our health in different ways. This article states only a general overview of possible health risks which can be associated with two particular types of novel cooking technologies where the regular exposure to such equipment can lead to chronic diseases. Therefore, it is very important to have better awareness regarding the possible health risks associated with the automated kitchen.

Prakash Schaffter, Managing Director of Janashakthi Insurance PL
Returning to being a specialist Life Insurance company, leading Sri Lankan insurer Janashakthi Insurance PLC (Janashakthi) reported its financial results for the three month period ended 31st March 2018.
Janashakthi had divested its General Insurance business earlier in the quarter, generating a substantial profit of Rs. 9.2 billion at a company level during the period under review. A significant portion of the proceeds from the sale was returned to shareholders in the form of a Rs. 11.7 billion share buyback, yet another reflection of Janashakthis commitment to its stakeholders.
Gross Written Premium (GWP) grew from Rs. 705 million to Rs. 764 million, a year on year (YoY) growth of 8%. Janashakthi also continued to stand by its policyholders, paying out Rs. 294 million in Net Benefits & Claims, a YoY growth of 5.4% over the Rs. 279 million recorded for the same period last year.
I am happy to report that we have kicked off FY 2018 on a positive note with a steady growth in premiums, said Prakash Schaffter, Managing Director of Janashakthi Insurance PLC. This will be a year of transition for us at Janashakthi as we focus on growing our Life Insurance business into a key player in the segment. The first half of 2018 will be a period of transformation and we are optimistic that the foundations laid during the previous year together with our singular focus on Life Insurance and ongoing efforts to rebuild an efficient distribution system will strengthen the Company and yield results in the future.
Investment income grew by 26% YoY, from Rs. 325 million to Rs. 408 million. This was aided largely by Janashakthis prudent reinvestment of the sales proceeds in short term securities until the share buyback was completed. The total assets of the Company stood at Rs. 18.5 billion due to the share buyback, wherein substantial revenue reserves of the Company were returned to shareholders with its completion in March 2018.
Jude Fernando, Director / Chief Executive Officer of Janashakthi Insurance PLC
This year is truly a year of change for us at Janashakthi, and we are eager to strongly establish our fundamentals to set up a robust Life Insurance business. Having embarked on restructuring our Life distribution network in 2017, we are reviewing our branch network and re-aligning our presence in the marketplace post the exit from the General Insurance segment. We hope that this, together with the renewed focus on the Life segment, will help us strengthen our core to deliver business growth in the coming year, said Jude Fernando, Director / Chief Executive Officer of Janashakthi Insurance PLC.
Speaking on behalf of the leadership of the Company, Prakash Schaffter added, As we bid adieu to a significant part of the Janashakthi family and embark on the next phase of our growth story, I would like to express our gratitude to everyone who has been a part of the Janashakthi journey, contributing towards the progress of the Company.
The Board of Directors of Janashakthi Insurance PLC comprises Mr. Husein Esufally, Chairman; Mr. Prakash Schaffter, Managing Director; Mr. Jude Fernando, Chief Executive Officer; Mr. Ramesh Schaffter; Mr. L. C. R. de C. Wijetunge; Ms. Anushya Coomaraswamy; Mrs. Manjula Mathews; and Mr. Eardley Perera.
Founded in 1994 as a Life Insurance company, Janashakthi Insurance PLC made its mark in the industry as an innovator and household name over a span of over 23 years. Janashakthi has a strong presence across the island, with an expanding Life Insurance network and a dedicated call centre. In line with its vision of lighting the lamp of insurance in every home and workplace, Janashakthi remains committed to becoming a leader in the Life Insurance industry by delivering a service beyond Insurance to its customers and stakeholders.

Keith Noyahr abduction: CID to record Speakers statement today
	
The Criminal Investigation Department (CID) would record a statement from Speaker Karu Jayasuriya today over the alleged abduction of journalist Keith Noyahr in 2008, a highly placed CID official said.
However, when asked whether the CID would record the statement at the Speakers office, he said the Speaker was yet to inform the place from where the statement could be recorded.
Earlier, the Speaker said that Keith Noyahrs life was saved because of his intervention when Keith was abducted and he was prepared any moment to make a statement in this regard.
Keith Noyahr was abducted and assaulted on May 22, 2008 in Dehiwala.
Karu Jayasuriya had been the Minister of Public Administration at the time of the incident and he had been the first person to inform the then President Mahinda Rajapaksa to secure the release of Keith Noyahr.
Earlier, the CID had informed the Speaker that they need to obtain a statement on how he had come to know of this abduction and several other matters connected with it. (Darshana Sanjeewa)

Lal De Alwis: Great entrepreneur and a jewel of a man
	
It was with profound sadness that I learned the passing away of Chandra Lal De Alwis, former Managing Director/ CEO of Chemanex Ltd. He was one of the most successful entrepreneurs/technocrats I have ever come across. Lal departed from the world, leaving a permanent void in the hearts of everyone associated with the rubber and chemical industries in Sri Lanka. His demise marks the end of a 40-year-era as a high profile entrepreneur associated with the rubber and agro-based industries in the country. 
My association with Lal commenced in the late nineteen seventies, when the sole supplier of the bleaching agent, namely RPA 3, Du Pont Company, a leading chemical manufacturer in USA, suddenly announced its withdrawal from the market. This announcement was a bolt from the blues and posed a big threat to the rubber estates in the country, who were the sole suppliers of this premium grade rubber to the whole world. There was no alternate chemical available for this purpose. 
The Minister of Plantation Industries at that time set a three-month deadline to the scientists of the Rubber Research Institute (RRI) to discover an alternate chemical to be used for this purpose. Even though, this directive was an unthinkable task to be accomplished in three months, we, the scientists of the RRI took this formidable challenge with a grit of determination and invented a chemical, which is now available in the market and capable of bleaching pigments in rubber latex, thereby making the rubber produced pure white. When this new chemical was launched in the rubber industry, there was resistance from the plantation sector to accept it, reverting from the oil soluble toxic form to the water soluble and health safe form. Then Lal, who was the General Manager of Chemanex Ltd, took a firm decision to help RRI to fully implement this new chemical to the crepe rubber industry facing all kinds of challenges by the distributors of the oil based toxic chemical. Thanks to his untiring efforts, RRI was able to fully substitute this new safe chemical manufactured by Chemanex Ltd in the crepe industry in the whole country.Lal was a devoted Buddhist who lived according to the teachings of Gautama Buddha. He held numerous positions in temples and many other social organizations. I had the privilege of learning the rudiments of facing challenges of market competitions and marketing a new product thanks to the indomitable support and advice I received from him. He was extremely honest and his heart was absolutely soft. He was courageous and objective in his endeavors. 
His death is an irreplaceable loss to the Rubber Industry in particular and to all Sri Lankans in general. 
May he attain the supreme bliss of nirvana. 
(Dr. L.M.K Tillekaratna, former Director of Rubber Research Institute)

Ministry orders inquiry over abandoned jumbo with gunshot injuries
	
The Wildlife Ministry yesterday ordered for an investigation into the incident where an elephant was found with gunshot injuries in Gomarankadawala, Trincomalee had been left without treatment by Wildlife Conservation Department officials claiming the injury was incurable.
Wildlife Deputy Minister Palitha Thewarapperuma told Daily Mirror that this elephant was found with gunshot injuries in January, 2018 and the wildlife officials claimed that it could not be cured and had to let the animal die.
The villagers did not allow that to happen and started treating and feeding the elephant daily. A village monk and some foreigners too had joined hands to this cause and raised funds to treat the wounded animal. Pathetically, the wildlife officials did not take any initiative to feed the pachyderm for the past five months until mid-May, he said.
The departments medical personnel have only administered a few injections to the injured elephant, he added.
I got to know this issue from a villager when I posted on social media to revert to me about issues related to elephants in the country. I visited the place yesterday to inquire about it. The elephant was in a critical condition and it had a very rare chance of surviving. Such incidents should not happen in the future, the deputy minister said.
He said that he had ordered the department to conduct an investigation into this matter and to take necessary action against its officials concerned.
Meanwhile, Wildlife Conservation Department Director General M.G.C. Sooriyabandara told Daily Mirror that he had ordered for an audit to probe into this incident in order to determine whether the departments officials had neglected their duties. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)

Sri Lankan rupees worth 2.87mn were found among the currencies seized from the Taman Duta home of former Malaysian premier Najib Razak since Wednesday, the Straits Times reported today.
The Malaysian Police seized over 50 luxury handbags from brands like Chanel, Gucci and Prada during the raid carried out at the Premiers residence.
The operation yielded a haul of ten luxury watches including several Rolexes, a Hublot and a Patek Philippe, as well as RM537,000 (S$181,000) and 2.87 million Sri Lankan rupees (S$24,400) in cash.
The crime investigation team lodged a report of the items taken from the Taman Duta mansion on Friday.
The 52 seized handbags included 16 from Chanel, 10 from Gucci, eight from Versace and five from Oscar de la Renta.
The police said the items were seized as the team had reasonable grounds to suspect they were the subject matter of a crime or crimes under Malaysia's Anti-Money Laundering, Anti-Terrorism Financing and Proceeds of Unlawful Activities Act 2001.

Mullivaikkal The tricky side
	

The commemoration of those killed in the north during the war has by now been a matter generally accepted, formalized with all northern Tamil political parties except the Eelam Peoples Democratic Party (EPDP) and the Northern Provincial Council organizing commemorative events.
The main events are to be held today at Mullivaikkal in Mullaithivu District, where the final battle between the Government forces and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) was fought.
In the first few years after the end of the war, the commemoration of the people killed in the north was not openly held. Only small groups led by politicians such as Provincial Councillor M.K. Sivajilingam travelled all the way to Mullivaikkal for such events.
However, now the main Tamil political coalition, the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) and even the Northern Provincial Council (NPC) which is a Government body are in the forefront in these occasions.
As the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) commemorates their colleagues who laid down their lives during their two insurrections, on two separate days, the northern politicians too, observe remembrance of those killed in the ethnic war on two separate days.
The JVP hold their Bak Maha Viru Samaruwa (Remembering of April heroes) on April 5 and the Il Maha Viru Samaruwa (Remembering of November heroes) on November 13.
It was on April 5, 1971, that the JVP launched its first insurrection. JVP founder leader Rohana Wijeweera was killed by the Army on November 13 in 1989 during its second uprising.
The LTTE venerated November 27 as its Great Heroes Day (Maveerar Naal) in commemoration of its first cadre Shankar, who died on November 27, 1982 and those killed at the final phase of the war are being remembered on May 18 on which day, LTTE leader Velupillai Prabhakaran is believed to have been killed by the Army in 2009.
After the decimation of the LTTE leadership, the other Tamil parties except for the EPDP hold their commemorations on both November 27 and May 18 which is now called Mullivaikkal Day.

"While JVP remembrance is accepted, what irks the south about Mullivaikal remembrance"
In spite of the popular belief that Prabhakaran was killed on May 18, 2009, retired Major General Kamal Gunarathne, who happened to command the regiment that killed the LTTE leader had told our sister paper Sunday Lankadeepa last week that it was during a skirmish in the morning of May 19 that his soldiers killed Prabhakaran.
The JVPs commemorations are now not seen as events unlawful or inimical to the national security as the partys professed cause has been socialism and the leaders of the party had several times renounced violence in their struggle for that end. 
However, the commemorations in the north has always been controversial mainly for two reasons  firstly, holding those events on a day assigned by the LTTE (November 27) for the purpose and on the day the LTTE leader was believed to have been killed (May 18) and secondly, holding them in the cemeteries earmarked by the outfit for the purpose and in the place where Prabhakaran was believed to have died.
It is always alleged that the northern politicians commemorate the LTTE in the guise of remembering the civilians killed in the war- that being a major reason for the southern aversion towards the northern commemorations.
Another reason for that antipathy especially by the Sinhalese is the genuine fear that those events might revive the dreaded rebel organization.
Despite the fact that the northern people suffered gravely at the hands of the LTTE by way of their taxes, restrictions, brutal punishments, destruction of infrastructures such as the railway service and road network and their conscription of children, they love and respect the organization and even venerate its leader.
Even those who opposed and hated the LTTE during its heyday seemed to be unhappy, when it was defeated by the security forces as they viewed it as a triumph by a Sinhalese force over a Tamil force.

"JVP commemorates their colleagues who laid down their lives during two insurrections, on two separate days
The LTTE venerated November 27 as its Maveerar Naal in commemoration of its first cadre Shankar, who died on November 27,"
Only the members of the parties such as the EPDP, who were hunted down by the LTTE until the end of the war, might have felt relieved, if not being happy, by the decimation of the LTTE leadership.
Whether one accepts it or not, this strong sense of nationalism is one aspect that the southern people and politicians have been refusing to recognise, while the northern Tamil leaders and the people reciprocally refuse to recognise the southern peoples nationalistic fears of secessionism and terrorism.
During the commemoration events, while the northern people weep over the deaths of their loved ones, the politicians eulogise the bravery, commitment and the sacrifices of the LTTE cadres, which in fact had sometimes been incredible.
As the southern people extol the sacrifice of soldiers such as the famous Hasalaka Gamini, who blew up an improvised LTTE armed vehicle at Elephant Pass in 1991, Tamil politicians glorify and eulogise hundreds, if not thousands of LTTE cadres who blew them up or, bit the cyanide capsule believing that it would help emancipate the Tamils from the clutches of the Sinhalese Government.
The Government is always concerned about this glorification of the LTTE cadres especially coupled with the demand for a solution to the ethnic problem as it might lead the Tamil youth to follow the path of those thus glorified.
This is not an unjustifiable concern as almost all ingredients for another uprising by the Tamils exist on the ground, in spite of their first armed struggle having been crushed and the leaders who led the struggle having been eliminated.
Tamil leaders and the media express a belief in self-rule for the Tamils in the north and east, irrespective of the question remaining as to what it means.
They claim that the successive Governments, even after the end of the war, had hoodwinked them.

"Another reason for that antipathy is the fear that those events might revive the dreaded rebel organization.
Northern leaders refuse to recognise the southern peoples fears of secessionism and terrorism."
Demonstrations and fasts are taking place occasionally in the north over the lands of the northern people occupied by the army during the war, the thousands of people who disappeared during the war and those languishing in prisons for years sometimes even without being charged. When these agitations are prolonged along with occasional glorification of the former rebels, one cannot rule out the possibility of youth being pushed to follow their yesteryear heroes.
However, the Tamil leaders too would not prefer such a situation though they attempt to gain political mileage from these commemorations.
They are not prepared to lead such armed struggles or at least to participate in them. Most of these political leaders were deemed as traitors by the LTTE till 2000, irrespective of the fact that some of them represented the armed groups formed in the 1980s to fight for a separate Tamil State.
In 2000 some invisible hands made them all of a sudden recognize the LTTE as the sole representative of the Tamil people and the LTTE to remove the traitor tag attached to them reciprocally. Even after that they, except for the EROS (Eelam Revolutionary Organisation of Students) led by V. Balakumaran were not prepared to take to arms.
Before 2000, LTTE killed many moderate Tamil leaders including Leader of the Opposition Appapillai Amirthalingam, (Leader of the main Tamil coalition, the Tamil United Liberation Front (TULF).
Northern Province Chief Minister C.V.Wigneswaran who is now in the forefront in glorifying the LTTE leaders was a judge of the Supreme Court that made rulings on the basis that the LTTE was an outlawed terrorist group.
Therefore these leaders would not be prepared to see another armed uprising by the Tamil youth.
Despite the danger of reigniting the fires of war, one cannot deny the right of the northern people to weep over their loved ones, who were killed or disappeared during the war and even to eulogise the LTTE cadres dedication and the sacrifice towards what they think is their emancipation.
On the other hand, despite the right of the northern people to commemorate their loved ones, one cannot accept anybody encouraging another ethnic war. This is the tricky aspect of the commemoration of the dead in the north.

No move to spend Rs.5.7 mn to renovate toilets: Rosy
	
There is no move to spend Rs.5.7 million to renovate the toilets at the Mayors official residence but some Rs.5.2 million is to be spent on preserving the entire bungalow as a place of archeologically value, Colombo Mayor Rosy Senanayake said today.
She said this when referring to a report which said Rs.5.7 million is to be spent for renovating the toilets in the Mayor's official residence.
I have sought the advice of an expert from the Department of Archaeology on renovating the official bungalow and preserving it as a place of archaeological value. It was this expert who adviced me on purchasing fittings and other material for the renovation. The method followed earlier was a fully fledged contract which included provding material and labour but this time the Colombo Municipal Council (CMC) will purchase the material and deploy CMC workers to carry out the work," the Mayor told a media briefing today.
She said this was a part of a programme to preserve buildings of archaeological value such as the Colombo Town Hall and the Old Town Hall.
I have my own private residence with seven bedrooms and eight toilets thanks to my husband. What we want to do is to make sure that the place where the City's 1st citizen meets foreign dignitaries is suitable for such meetings. This property belonged to the people not to me, the Mayor said.
The media release issued by her earlier said the CMC had been under the administration of the Municipal Commissioner for more than one and half years similar to other local government institutions and therefore Mayors bungalow had also remained closed and unused. (Yohan Perera)

Positive use of AI for all - EDITORIAL
	
In this era when information and communication technology is playing a vital role in shaping a new world, the United Nations yesterday celebrated the World Telecommunication and Information Society Day. 
According to the UN, the World Telecommunication Day has been celebrated annually on May 17 since 1969, marking the founding of the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) and the signing of the first International Telegraph Convention in 1865. The changes that have taken place since then are beyond our understanding, imagination or expectations. 
In November 2005, the World Summit on the Information Society called upon the UN General Assembly to declare May 17 as World Information Society Day to focus on the importance of information and communication technology and the wide range of issues related to the Information Society raised by the World Summit on the Information Society. 
The purpose of this day is to help raise awareness of the possibilities that the use of the internet and other ICT channels could bring to societies and ways to bridge the digital divide.
The theme this year is imaginative if not astoundingenabling the positive use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) for all. 
The UN says that in recent years there has been significant progress in AI technology, made possible by tremendous advances in contributing fields, such as Big Data, machine learning, computing power, storage capacity and cloud computing. AI-based technologies are already emerging as a key component of proactive tools and applications being used to help people lead better lives by improving healthcare, education, finance, agriculture, transportation, and a wide range of other services.
Member nations are called upon to celebrate this day organizing appropriate national programmes, with a view to stimulating reflection and exchange of ideas on the theme, debating the various aspects of the theme with all partners in society and formulating a report reflecting national discussions on the issues underlying the theme, to be fed back to ITU and the rest of its membership. 
In Sri Lanka, an Association for Artificial Intelligence (SLAAI) was started in 2000. It is a non-profit scientific association devoted to understanding of the mechanisms underlying thoughts and intelligent behaviour and their emulation in machines. SLAAI says its membership represents both academia and industry in the country while the primary objectives of SLAAI are to increase public awareness of Artificial Intelligence, improve teaching and research in AI, and also promote industry academia partnership in the use of AI techniques for real world problem solving. 
ITU Secretary-General Houlin Zhao in a message says, AI is taking centre stage with a lot of impact on peoples lives. AIs potential power is being exploited and developed at an unprecedented speed. AI brings us many opportunities and challenges. AI will greatly change our economy and society.
According to the Guardian newspaper, AI is a spectre that haunts the modern workforce. Some studies suggest up to 30% of people could lose their jobs to it. Driverless vehicles could see the end of truck drivers, robots could increasingly take over even complex manufacturing, personal assistants and customer support workers may be made redundant. Robots look set to judge gymnastics. Not content with the three options provided in reply emails in Gmail, Google will now even write a whole email for you.

## Title: Reconciliation called Godot  and Mullivaikkal Week

Reconciliation called Godot  and Mullivaikkal Week
	
The first public consultation by the Members of the Office on Missing Persons was held in Mannar a week ago, 01 year and 09 months after the law was passed in Parliament. The mood of the participants, the affected mothers, fathers, family members and civil society representatives werent in line with the placards that read Welcome OMP in Tamil, held outside, for the media. 
Though there wasnt much hype over the event, especially in Sinhala mainstream media, the coverage nevertheless said, there was scepticism, frustration, disagreements on powers of the OMP and much grumbling about how far the OMP would actually go with its investigations.
There was one simple demand though from the participants. A demand for a fundamental difference in how the OMP would approach the festering issue they are mandated with.
Participants were quite clear about it, although the ITAK leaders of the TNA in Parliament meekly gave into the Yahapalanaya leaders in bringing the OMP Act for missing persons. 
These mothers, fathers and family members said, their sons and daughters didnt just go missing. They disappeared after they were handed over or taken over by some State authority.
The message was clear from day one of the OMP meeting with affected families in Mannar.
With much resentment about the setting up of the OMP without any consultations with the affected persons, they wanted the OMP and by default, the Yahapalana Government to at least accept, their family members were not just missing but were victims of enforced disappearances at the hands of the State. It meant in no uncertain terms, If the Government is not even willing to accept their family members were victims of enforced disappearances by the State, what purpose would it serve for them to come before the OMP Obviously, if they were persons who had just gone missing, then there is no necessity for the Government to have a special Act passed in Parliament and have an OMP at taxpayers expense.

"Why the South needs to re-visit the bloody massacres during the JVP insurgency to learn a lesson or two on reconciliation"
If the yahapalanaya Government believes and the ITAK leadership agrees they were about persons gone missing, these people should have been asked to lodge complaints with the closest Police Station for the normal investigation process to take place, instead of an OMP looking into them. The bottom line is, if the Government is not prepared to accept the issue is about enforced disappearances, then the OMP is another fraud played out on these people.
It is not simply on legal jargon these affected families in Vanni are arguing on. Yet, they firmly believe it is the responsibility of any duly elected Government, to accept there were enforced disappearances of citizens of this country during the last phase of the war and after the war was, militarily concluded. 
That, in fact, is the conflict. These affected families know how their beloved sons, daughters and family members disappeared, but this Government, as the previous Rajapaksa regime did, does not want to accept the responsibility of State security forces in disappearances. That leads to many things that are obvious. Reconciliation remains just rhetoric in Sri Lankan politics, reduced to promises in public statements made by Southern political leaders and to mostly irrelevant livelihood projects for North and East, funded by donor agencies and their Western Governments. 
No difference to the previous Rajapaksa Government, the present yahapalana Government restricts their response to North and East and that too without consultations with war-affected people and without considering what their priorities are.
They want the world to accept what they do as reconciliation is just right. 
One major reason for reconciliation to remain in the clouds is the political impotence of Sinhala leaders in facing up to the challenge of taking up post-war issues. 
Their Sinhala racist bias is in avoiding any dialogue with the Sinhala South, on what the war-affected people keep demanding as their legitimate due. What is therefore termed as Reconciliation in the Sinhala South is what Southern Sinhala extremism would not question.
But reconciliation depends solely on the acceptance and the ability of the Sinhala South to dialogue issues in the war-torn North and East. 
The Southern Sinhala ability to accept the conclusion of the post-war human issues are far more serious and complex than what the South experienced during the JVP led massacres and the State repression.

"Scepticism, frustration, disagreements on powers of the OMP and much grumbling about how far the OMP would actually go
Accept, their family members were not just missing but were victims of enforced disappearances at the hands of the State."
Army camps established in the South and the district military Coordinating officers appointed to co-ordinate security (Lt. Colonel Gotabhaya Rajapaksa was Co-ordinating Officer Matale) were withdrawn a few months after the JVP terror campaign was brutally crushed. 
All who were detained with and without proper legal proceedings were released without prosecutions. Detention centres that were run by the military in most parts of the South were dismantled within a very short period. Schools that were occupied by the military were handed over to educational authorities with equal speed. The military was immediately removed from all civil activities and from security operations in the South.
Most, unfortunately, there was no serious and consistent campaign demanding the 60,000 disappearances that Mahinda Rajapaksa spoke about in his Human Rights campaign should be investigated into.
The Mothers Front that Mahinda Rajapaksa along with Mangala Samaraweera brought on stage led by Dr. Manorani Saravanamuttu was swallowed up by then Opposition SLFP and thus folded up without much impact. In 1995 under President Chandrika Kumaratunges Presidency, the Manouri Muttettuwegama Commission could count only around 24,000 disappearances from representations made to it.
Regrouping of the JVP was also accepted and allowed. 
Nobody asked the new JVP leaders where they hid their weapons and ammunition. No one asked for investigations into hundreds of killings attributed to the JVP and demanded arrests of suspected JVP cadres.
Neither the Police nor the military intelligence visited their homes regularly and tracked their daily life. They had all the freedom to get involved in political activities.
True enough, there were no investigations into excesses by security forces and the police as it was after the 1971 JVP insurrection when the Kataragama Manamperi arrest, torture, rape and murder was investigated and the military officers responsible were prosecuted. After 1987 to 90 bloody massacres were over, both the affected Sinhala families and the Sinhala State had reconciled to leave them behind and get along. So much so, no one ever bothers to ask if the proscription slapped on the JVP during the 1983 July Tamil pogrom was ever lifted. 
North-East is certainly treated differently after a much bloodier end to the war. Security forces camps that were established during the last stages of the war and after still remain with permanent structures. 

"One major reason for reconciliation to remain in the clouds is the political impotence of Sinhala leaders in facing up to the challenge of taking up post-war issues."
Regions occupied by security forces have not been given back to their legitimate owners. The intelligence and surveillance networks still operate. The military has carved out profitable areas of economic life in North-East, for their own businesses.
And they remain decision makers in Northern and Eastern daily life purely on the strength of Sinhala Buddhist politics. 
Without any serious discourse on these issues in the South, Reconciliation remains like the proverbial Godot that never comes.
This reluctance in Southern politics is what radicalises agitations in the Vanni and the North. It is this reluctance to accept responsibility for the disappeared and the dead that mobilises affected people to commemorate the dead. It is this reluctance in the South to accept war atrocities that have driven the Tamil people to demand investigations. 
It is also this Sinhala Buddhist politics that compel the Vanni and North to say the OMP will not deliver results and it would not, unless the Southern Sinhala leaders turn South instead of North, to give reconciliation the lead it deserves.
It is the stubborn and sectarian reluctance in Sinhala South that decides the radicalising of the North-East in the absence of effective reconciliation. The South needs to re-visit the bloody massacres during the JVP insurgency to learn a lesson or two on Reconciliation- to accept Mulllivaikkal week as the Tamil version of the Il Maha Viru commemorations and de-militarising as that is what took place during post-1987-90 repression in the Sinhala South. 
That certainly would be the path for reconciliation and confidence building to begin a new way forward with a shared destiny. 
Maybe, I am asking exactly the opposite of what the Sinhala extremism and the Sinhala political leaders want to live with. I wish I could be wrong on that.

The month of Ramadhan: The Benediction  of fasting
	
Philosophy of fasting and the command to fast, whatever its details may be, is to be found in all religions in one form or another. Fasting is a colossal spiritual institution that helps people achieve divine as well as non-material, social, cultural, economical and healthy physical development.
In the context of fasting, the Holy Quran reveals, O you who believe! fasting is prescribed for you , as it was prescribed for those before you, so that you may guard against evil. (The Holy Quran 2:183-184)
The early devotions and fasting of Gautama Buddha (Buddha charithaya, Laalitha vistara), the fasting of Moses before he received the Ten Commandments (Exod.34:28Deut9:9), the fasting of Jesus before he received the Heavenly call (matt 4:2), all testify or substantiate to the importance of this institution.
Both Jesus and the Christians took to fasting as a mere mode of expiation or penitence or for purposes even narrower and strictly formal. During ancient times fasting was also instituted as a sign of mourning or when danger threatened or when the seer was preparing himself for a divine revelation.
However, fasting was not prescribed for the Muslims in the same form which was prescribed for the people of earlier faiths. Islam has introduced absolutely a new meaning into this theological institution of fasting. Islam exceedingly spiritualized this institution by attaching a number of highly practical and beneficial regulations and restrictions
It was during the month of Ramadhan that, Allahs biggest favour to mankind, began to be revealed. Fasting thus represents thanksgiving on mans part for being blessed with such perfect guidance, as it is contained in the Holy Quran, which introduces itself as the eternal guidance for the whole of mankind. Outstanding features demonstrated in this sacred Book are reflected in its categorical commands which help man derive auspicious directions and discern between good and evil and right and wrong. 
The objective of fasting is to achieve Taqua (inspiring awe) and curb the selfish soul (nafs), to discipline it and bring it under control. Hence discipline commands and dominates in all aspects of human activities in promoting righteousness, in his or her worldly affairs, as well as the Hereafter. Fasting in the real sense will definitely facilitate to evoke discipline and indoctrination, into the life structure of man.
How do we fast
Fasting is observed physically where one has to abstain from food, drinks, conjugal relations and other such involvements. This practice is followed during the time of fasting from dawn to dusk. By doing so we seek the protection of the soul from all animal like desires and inclinations, while perceiving thoughts and aspirations tend towards spiritual obsession. Travelers and the sick can differ fasting during Ramadhan and make up for it later.
The command to fast in reality is attained in two ways. In the first place, when a man commits morally wrong deeds and becomes deserving of Allahs punishment on account of those deeds, but later feels ashamed of them and turns to Allah in repentance, in such an instance, fasting serves as atonement for his sin. Secondly fasting not only makes a man fit and able to bear hardships, but also makes him realize the suffering of his brethren in distress and has sympathy towards them. Fasting goes a long way to remove and minimize the pains and sufferings of humanity.
Fasting also develops self control and helps a man to overcome selfishness, greed, lusty emotions, laziness and many other immoral defects and imperfects that take root in a human being. This great auspicious observance will also enable the individual to eliminate, vengeans, hatred, hostility, incredulity and similar detrimental forces that ruins peaceful attitude an individual possesses.
It is also an annual training programme that refreshes the man, enabling him to carry out his or her obligations to Allah, the Creator and Sustainer Sawm (fasting). Fasting accredits us to experience the pains of hunger and thirst. It empowers us to understand for ourselves the sustainability and the physical existence of an empty stomach. We can begin to comprehend and assimilate the real situation when embracing this concept. Spiritual men of all religions unanimously endorse and testify, on the basis of personal experience, that a certain degree of severance from physical relations and worldly connection is essential for spiritual advancement and has a powerful purifying effect on the mind. Besides, it cannot be denied that carrying such severity too far is sure to weaken the body to such an undesirable extent as to render a person unfit, not only to fulfill his social and religious obligation, but also to withstand temptation which requires a certain amount of strength. Islam therefore has gifted to mankind the path of the golden mean.
The month of Ramadhan is like the season of spring where the trees bloom and greenery is visible. Similarly, the dry trees of faith find life in Ramadhan, through the sprinkling moisture of good actions. Those who do not know the value of Ramadhan are in great loss, as communicated by Prophet Muhammed (PBUH), in his sayings.

"Fasting also develops self control and helps a man to overcome selfishness, greed, lusty emotions, laziness and many other immoral defects and imperfects that take root in a human being"
While it does prescribe a certain degree of abstaining from material pleasure, it does not permit the weakening of the body. Fasting allows the body to perform its normal functions. This is why Holy Prophet has forbidden continuous fasting saying, you have a claim upon yourself and your family has a claim upon you and your guests have a claim upon you (Thirmidhi). On another occasion he is reported to have said verily I am the most righteous of you all; yet sometimes I fast and sometimes I abstain from fasting and so must you (Bukhari) 
Islam does not manifest any commandment which is impossible of compliance. Hence, while referring to its injunctions about fasting, the Holy Quran makes it clear that, whosoever is ill or on a journey should not fast, but redeem the omission by fasting an equal number of days at some other time, when the sickeness is cured or the journey is concluded.
Aged men and women, weak persons, pregnant women and mothers breastfeeding their infants may make amends for their non-observance of fasting each day by feeding a poor man, in accordance with the criterion of food.

"Fasting in Islam appears as an intensive spiritual exercise, touching upon every aspect of mans life in this world and devoted entirely to Allah, the Creator and the Sustainer as thanksgiving"
In the wake of the fasting period, legitimate and truthful obedience and piety are developed. The month of Ramadhan is the month of forgiveness, mercy and solace and the religious practices during this period helps avoid the punishment of hell. The obligation of fasting is for Allahs sake alone and there is a delightful and attractive reward for this, in the life hereafter.
Fasting in Islam appears as an intensive spiritual exercise, touching upon every aspect of mans life in this world and devoted entirely to Allah, the Creator and the Sustainer as thanksgiving. This conception in Islam is a voluntary and cheerful renunciation, for a definite period, of all the appetites of flesh lawful in themselves, and as well a salutary exercise of both body and spirit, declares a saintly intellectual.
Naturally it is a reasonable part of preparing the soul for the maintenance of self-control in times of strong temptations.
In reference to comparative religions, the Islamic concept of fasting entices the following substantial accolade, according to well versed intellectuals, from all corners of the world.
This is a remarkable discipline, exclusively in places where the temperature becomes very hot during the day, and it gives an unique unification in Muslims throughout the world, because they know they are engaged in this fast together. It represents a sacrifice, a limitation upon indulgence, and a kind of purification. 
Factors that nullify the fast 
Deliberate eating or drinking, anything entering the body through the nose or mouth, including smoking, sniffing and powder substance, and having conjugal relations (sex between husband and wife or by any other means) will nullify the fast.
A Muslim is expected to keep away from all forbidden actions while fasting. Deceitful acts of any kind are forbidden during a fast. Patience is one of the most significant possessions that Islam has instituted. This concept is one of the most righteous characteristics that fasting has introduced. While fasting, man has to sometimes experience a few unusual difficulties, where intolerance and anger may be provoked. Patience against these common elements are taught and practised through fasting. Patience is a contribution of faith and it is the main source of salvation. Spiritually acclaimed righteous persons, attain a high degree of excellence and benefit from Almighty through patience, after following the guidance of the Prophet (PBUH). And if patience is established, a great reward awaits in return.
Charity during fasting is instituted as the next valuable deed. Hence, helping the disadvantaged sector of the society, such as the orphans, the widows, the needy the sick and the poor are recommended in collaboration with the institution of fasting. These groups of people in the society have to be supported financially and in kind, and they should be given a helping hand to free themselves from the embarrassing and pathetic situations they are in. We should show sympathy and move with them in harmony, as they are our brothers and sisters. These sort of charitable approaches would enable us to embrace the forgiveness of The Almighty.

Understanding the importance of nutrition rich milk
	

Complementary feeding provides the child with nutrients like iron which are otherwise not obtained through mothers milk
Milk is rich in protein, calcium and vitamins. Milk food groups contribute towards a body building function. Proteins are especially important in the growth stage

Milk is a favourite refreshment, not to mention the nutritional values it carries. Milk is especially a favourite among children. From whole to skimmed, milk is available in many forms. However no form of milk is able to beat the nutritional goodness of mothers breast milk. Mothers milk plays a vital role regarding the growth of a child, specially during the first 6 months and even up to 2 years. However after the age of 2, milk is no longer adequate for the growth of a child. Roshan Dela Bandara, Nutritionist, Nutrition Society of Sri Lanka spoke about milk nutrition during infancy. He highlighted the importance of breastfeeding children during the first 2 years of infancy and fulfilling the additional nutritional requirements that follow.

Nourishment
 From the time of birth, the baby should be exclusively breastfed for 6 months. At the start of the 7th month complementary feeding should be commenced alongside breast feeding. This should be continued up to the age of 2 years or more, said Bandara. Referring to the WHO guidelines and Infant and Young children feeding guidelines for Sri Lanka, he stated that breastfeeding the child during the first 6 months after birth contributes towards the babys proper growth and provides the required immunity to fight against infections, develop the motor and cognitive functions. Feeding infants with breast milk is advised for working mothers where the milk can be obtained and stored under refrigeration so that their babies are not deprived of the nutrition that breast milk provides, the nutritionist informed stressing that proper support is needed from family and working places for this task.  After 2 years of age breastfeeding is not necessary. By that time the child should be trained to eat usual family meals. The child should be given a balanced meal that adheres to the basic five food group category. Milk and milk products fall under one category. Therefore milk does not necessarily have to be given in liquid form after two years. The milk requirement can be satisfied through milk products such as cheese, curd and yoghurt etc,Bandara continued.
According to the nutritionist, a meal has 3 vital aspects. They are the provision of energy for daily activities, supporting growth and development of the body and finally providing protection from disease. Energy is provided by carbohydrates and fats. Proteins contribute towards growth while vitamins and minerals protect the body against diseases.

child should be first fed with food and only then given milk. If a child is first fed with milk, it leaves no room in the stomach for food. This deprives the child of the other essential nutrients. Introduction of early complementary feeding before 6 months is dangerous


Complementary feeding
Milk is rich in protein, calcium and vitamins. Milk food groups contribute towards a body building function. Proteins are especially important in the growth stage. This is sufficiently provided to the infant by mothers milk during the first 6 months, he stated. However the infants nutrition requirements grow gradually and cannot be met by breastfeeding alone. Complementary feeding provides the child with nutrients like iron which are otherwise not obtained through mothers milk, he added.
Bandara stressed that at the start of the 7th month complementary feeding should include the gradual introduction of different foods along with mothers milk. He pointed out that the main aim of complementary feeding is to train the baby to get accustomed to the usual family meal.

Dos and Donts
During the complementary feeding period, the child should be first fed with food and only then given milk. If a child is first fed with milk, it leaves no room in the stomach for food. This deprives the child of the other essential nutrients. Introduction of early complementary feeding before 6 months is dangerous. A baby can be exposed to the high risk of food allergies, he warned. Therefore complementary feeding should commence at the appropriate time.
The nutritionist advised against switching to formula milk after 6 months . He mentioned that there are certain cases where the infant is unable to receive sufficient breast milk from the mother. During such instances formula milk may be considered under recommendation of a paediatrician . However mothers milk is the best option. Upon recommendations of a pediatrician if a child is given formula milk, it is advised not to bottle feed the child. Efforts must be taken to train the child to drink milk using a cup and spoon. This is because bottle feeding allows child to easily suck in the milk while sucking milk from mother requires effort which helps in the development and strengthening of the cheek and jaw muscles. When the child is bottle fed, he gets accustomed to easy sucking and is reluctant to be breastfed, explicated Bandara.

Nutrition inadequacy
The current busy lifestyles have forced mothers to pay less attention to preparing nutritious meals for kids. Unfortunately mothers think that just a glass of milk is sufficient, but in reality a glass of milk is not enough for proper growth. It reduces the intake of other important foods such as fruits and vegetables, which deprives the children of other nutrients making them susceptible to other diseases. A glass of milk does not suffice for a complete meal as children get older, he mentioned.
Therefore it is important for parents to properly understand the nutritional requirements of children and prepare meals accordingly. A healthy diet will ensure a happy childhood .

Voicing his opinion cost him his job
	

A leading political authority sacked a white-collar high-up handling development projects for expressing his opinion that a monetary allocation made for funding certain projects in a backward district is unreasonably excessive, they say.

The high political authority had set apart only Rs.7 billion to develop a main city with many shortcomings while allocating more than twice that amount for the development projects in the backward district. The white-collar high-up had pointed out that it was not advisable to put up in the backward district the type of massive infrastructures suited for an urban population as the overhead costs for their maintenance alone would become an unwieldly expenditure.
Affronted by the opinion expressed by the white-collar high-up, the high political authority had angrily retorted: Follow orders or get out.

Why the SLSFTA is a lost opportunity
	
Institute of Engineers points out that the agreement between the two nations is doomed to fail because it was prepared without the input of key professional bodies

The Institution of Engineers, (IESL) that I represent as its President, is a Professional Body, founded in 1906 and incorporated in 1968 through an Act of Parliament. Currently IESL consists of nearly 20,000 Members who are engineers, among whom are more than 5000 Chartered Engineers. 
IESL is the professional body in Sri Lanka that is now allowed to authorize the registration of engineering practitioners in the three categories of practitioners, viz. Chartered Engineers, Associate Engineers and Affiliate Engineers, under the Engineering Council Act of Sri Lanka of
March 2017.
We ensure the high quality of engineering services provided by our members for the sustainable development of Sri Lanka, by setting standards for required educational qualifications and competence levels for practice of engineering in Sri Lanka, conducting examinations and assessing educational qualifications and competence standards, and providing opportunities for continuous professional development. 
Why are engineers gravely concerned about the SLSFTA
So why are we so concerned as a Professional Body, about the Sri Lanka  Singapore Free Trade Agreement (SLSFTA) signed on 23rd January and came into effect from 1st May 2018 Trade liberalization is a stated policy of the Government, and we understand that they can be effectively used to attract Foreign Direct Investments (FDI) and develop a country. 
In this SLSFTA, Sri Lanka and Singapore have liberalized trade in Goods, Services and other areas to certain extents. The full agreement, comprising 17 chapters (over 1000 pages), available at the website of the Ministry of Development Strategies and International Trade (MoDSIT), from 7th April 2018, is a very complex document. 
Our emphasis is on Chapter 7, relating to Trade in Services, and its Annexes 7A and 7B, which are the Schedules of Commitments agreed on by Sri Lanka and Singapore respectively. The details of commitments as to which sectors of services are liberalized, and in which Mode/s and to what degree each of those service sectors is liberalized by each country are given in these Schedules of Commitments. Annex 7A gives the Schedules of Commitments by Sri Lanka, and Annex 7B gives the Schedules of Commitments by Singapore. 
Annexes 7A and 7B contain the details of the commitments Sri Lanka and Singapore are making with respect to the Services sectors each country is liberalizing, and under which mode and the limitations on Market Access and National Treatment each country is offering to the other country. 
I believe that, in order to understand the reasons for IESL having grave concerns about the SLSFTA, it is necessary to give a brief introduction to the concepts in Free Trade Agreements for Trade in Services in general. 
Agreements on Trade in Services according to the World Trade Organization Rules
These are agreements prepared under the GATS (General Agreement on Trade in Services) framework developed by the World Trade Organization (WTO). 
This is the first time that Sri Lanka has signed a bilateral Free Trade Agreement where Trade in Services has been liberalized. Unlike agreements on Trade in Goods, these agreements could lead to very complex situations because peoples professions and livelihoods are getting affected at a national scale. These cannot be formulated and negotiated by merely a group of experts on international trade. Recognizing the complex situations that could arise in the case of trade in services, WTO has mentioned that unlike in the case of trade in goods, preparation of trade in services agreements should have strong stakeholder participation. 
We must remember that these Free Trade Agreements are negotiated between the two countries, based on the rules established under GATS Framework by the WTO. The two countries have the liberty to decide on which sectors are to be liberalized, in which Mode/s they would be liberalized, and any restrictions that they would bring in, within the main framework of GATS. 
Unlike in Trade in Goods (under GATT framework), in the Trade in Services under GATS, the liberalization can take place with respect to Market Access for the other party, and the way the other party is treated as equal to ones own nationals (National Treatment). The services trade can take place in four different Modes, defined as 
Mode 1  Cross Border Supply - the possibility for the Foreign Service Suppliers to supply services cross-border into the Members territory, without coming into the country, such as through internet 
Mode 2  Consumption Abroad - the freedom for the Members residents to go to the other country and purchase services 
Mode 3  Commercial Presence - the opportunities for the Foreign Service suppliers to establish, operate or expand a commercial presence in the Members territory, such as a branch, agency, or wholly-owned subsidiary, and 
Mode 4  Presence of Natural Persons (Humans) - the possibilities offered for the entry and temporary stay in the Members territory for foreign individuals in order to supply a service. 

When liberalizing trade in services, the countries will agree on their commitments that cover all sectors that are liberalized, which are called Horizontal Commitments and then go into the sector specific commitments which are called vertical commitments. Under both horizontal and vertical commitments, the countries have three options for limiting the degree of liberalization, . If the country decides not to liberalize a certain services sector, it will not appear in the vertical commitments section at all. 
Freedom to set limitations
Thus, it can be seen that, initially, at the time of preparing the Free Trade Agreements, freedom is given for the two parties to include the specific services sectors that will be liberalized, to what degree the Market Access would be opened for the foreign party and to what extent the foreign investors will be treated as equal to ones own nationals (National Treatment) under each Mode of trading in the schedules of Commitment. 

"In order to negotiate services trade agreements, it is not enough to have specialists in International Trade and lawyers during the drafting stages of the documents. This is where the input from the Professionals in the respective sectors becomes extremely important"
This is where the negotiation between the two countries becomes very important 
Have our negotiations been effectively done to protect our Professionals and Younger Generation
In order to do negotiate services trade agreements, it is not enough to have specialists in International Trade and lawyers during the drafting stages of the documents. This is where the input from the Professionals in the respective sectors becomes extremely important. They are the ones who know the intricacies of the services that are to be liberalized, which areas need to be strengthened with foreign inputs and which areas should be left for the local investors and entrepreneurs. 
This is clearly seen when the Schedules of Commitments for Sri Lanka and Singapore (Annexes 7A and 7B respectively) are compared. As an example, in the horizontal commitments themselves (applicable to all sectors), Singapore schedule has the conditions for Mode 3 (Commercial presence) under National Treatment as: A foreigner who wishes to register a business firm must have a local manager who should be a Singapore citizen or a Singapore Permanent Resident or a Singapore Employment Pass holder; at least one director of the company must be locally resident; all branches of foreign companies registered in Singapore must have at least 2 locally resident agents. (To qualify as locally resident, a person should be either a Singapore citizen or Singapore Permanent Resident or Singapore Employment Pass holder). Sadly, the Sri Lankan schedules do not have any such restrictions, either in the horizontal commitments or vertical commitments. In fact, even the first page that lists the Explanatory Notes of the Annexes 7A and 7B shows how loosely the Sri Lankan Schedules of Commitments have been prepared, compared to the Singaporean Schedules. 
IESLs stand on the SLSFTA
We do not object to the entry of new technologies and specialists required for the sustainable development of the country under proper controls, and built in conditions for knowledge and skill transfer. There are enough opportunities under the GATS framework to build in these limitations, which could have been exploited to the benefit of Sri Lanka, if the professionals were involved during the preparation of the Schedules of Commitments. However, the SLSFTA, is a total failure, prepared without the input of key Professional Bodies, completely ignoring the concerns of the Professionals with regard to the unfair competition and lack of opportunities for the local Professionals to get the advantage of the expected new investments in the country. This agreement will lead to brain drain and unrest among the young generation of engineers in particular, who will be graduating from our Universities at an annual rate exceeding 1800. We vehemently object to the SLSFTA in its current form. We see this as a lost opportunity for the Sri Lankan Government to increase the Foreign Direct Investments and develop the country in a sustainable manner, using a correctly formulated and executed Free Trade Agreement with Singapore.

A guide to pick a life-long partner
	


Belief in Astrology in our society has gained such firm ground, even the young couples who fall in love make it a point to consult an astrologer to ascertain whether their bond of love would last until the inevitable death putsthem apart.

Marriages destined to break up or end in tragedy midway
We know that some love affairs turn stormy midway and lovers go their separate ways or come to tragic ends. In certain cases, love affairs run smooth the entire course until tying the knot. But unresolvable differences and problems surface after the marriage making the life for the both miserable.

A guide to seek a lasting love
It can be ascertained whether love between a young couple is deep, abiding and steadfast by a cursory glance at their horoscopes.
Following astrological principles will serve as a guidance for young couples seeking enduring love and lasting marital happiness to pick the suitable partner.
The 7th House in the natal Chart represents marriage and life partner. If the lord of the 7th House is hemmed in between two malefics in the 6th or the 8th House, the native should exercise care in selecting a partner.
For a successful marriage, Moon, Jupiter and Mars should be strong in the female Chart and Venus, Mars and Jupiter should be strong in the male Chart.
A strong Lagna lord, a 7th lord and an unafflicted Venus should be in both Charts for a successful marriage.
The 10th lord in the female horoscope should not be stronger than the 10th lord in the male horoscope.
There should be no Parivartana or an exchange of Houses by Sun and Saturn in both Charts.
The Lagna lord and the 7th lord placed in the 6th and the 8th Houses from the Lagna or the Moon sign is not favourable, because such a planetary position would lead to endless quarrels between the couple.
Malefics planets in the 2nd, 4th, 7th, 8th and the 12th in both Charts can lead to an unsuccessful marriage. Mars in any of these Houses causes the Kuja Dosha. However, there are astrological factors that nullify or cancel out the Kuja Dosha.
The 7th lord in debilitation in both Charts i.e. Venus in Virgo in the male Chart or Jupiter in Capricorn in the female Chart, could lead to problems in married life (unless there are planetary positions that nullify this blemish such as the placement of these debilitated planets in favourable signs in the Navamsa Chart or those leading to the arising of Neechabhanga Rajayoga.)
The 7th lord in the 6th can lead to two marriages. If Venus is afflicted in the male chart, the native can be impotent due to sickness or other reasons.
Malefics in the 7th from Venus can deny the native marital happiness.


Combinations causing love marriages
Following are some of the planetary combinations that lead to love marriages:
	Saturn and Moon in conjunction or in mutual aspect or Saturn aspecting Moon would cause a love marriage.
	Rahu in conjunction with Venus or aspecting Venus, the 7th lord or the well posited Lagna lord while being aspected by the 7th lord would bring about a love marriage.
	A debilitated Venus with connections to the Lagna and the 7th lords would lead to a love marriage.
	Love marriages would end in failure if the 7th House, the 7th lord and Venus are denied the aspect of Jupiter and are under the aspect of malefics.
	If neutral (neither friendly nor inimical) planets are strongly posited, love marriages become successful. If they are weak, love marriages fail.
	Venus in the 5th leads to falling in love
	Generally, if Venus is in the 5th House, the native falls in love. If Venus is in the 9th, the native gets a great deal of attention from the opposite sex.

AI urges SL to release lists of forcibly disappeared
	
The Amnesty International (AI) today calledon the Sri Lankan government to provide information to the families of the disappeared, with detailed lists and information of persons who surrendered to the armed forces in the final phase of the war.
In a statement, the AI said according to surviving family members, more than 100 cadres of the LTTE, who surrendered to the Sri Lankan army in May 2009, have disappeared.
Reportedly, one group of surrenders was led by Father Francis Joseph, a Catholic Priest who was disappeared thereafter. According to family members who witnessed the surrenders, they were transported from the site by the army in a convoy of buses, it said.
It said the families of the disappeared hadfiled habeas corpus applications in 2013, seeking information about their whereabouts.
They claim to have last seen their family members in the custody of the 58th Division of the Sri Lankan Army. In February 2016, the General Officer Commanding of the Division, Major General Kavinda Chanakya Gunawardena was ordered to submit the list to the Mullaitivu Magistrate court before 19 April 2016. Subsequent to failing to produce this list on two occasions, the Magistrate in late September 2016 ordered the Criminal Investigation Department to investigate,it said.
It said President Maithripala Sirisena who is also the Chairperson of the National Security Council promised that he would instruct the Council to release lists of persons who surrendered to the Armed forces in the final phase of the war.
However, 11 months later these lists have not been released. The mass disappearance of those who surrendered at the end of the war is a clear indication of the institutionalization of the practice of enforced disappearances in Sri Lanka, the AI said.

It said Sri Lanka has one of the worlds highest number of disappearances, with a backlog of between 60,000 and 100,000 alleged disappearances since the late 1980s.
Meanwhile, it said Sri Lanka has made welcome progress on the issue of disappearances with the criminalization of enforced disappearances in March 2018.
However, the Sri Lankan government must support the spirit of these measures by proactively supporting truth-seeking efforts by the families of the disappeared to get answers, almost a decade after the end of the armed conflict. Likewise, Sri Lanka should promptly recognize the competence of the Committee on Enforced Disappearances to receive and consider communications from or on behalf of victims or their relatives, the statement said.

Automatic fuel pricing formula, a major step:IMF
	
International Monetary Fund yesterday said that automatic fuel pricing mechanism marks a major step towards completing the energy pricing reforms that are underway in Sri Lanka, and minimizes the fiscal risks.
If implemented properly, the formula based pricing would eliminate fuel subsidies that benefit the rich rather than the poor,Gerry Rice of the IMFs communications department told media in Washington on Thursday.
He also revealed that the IMF is scheduled to discuss Sri Lanka's completion of its fourth review on June 1.
So, we think it (fuel pricing formula) would benefit Sri Lanka and the economy. And I can tell you our Board is scheduled to discuss Sri Lanka's completion of its fourth review on June 1, he added.
