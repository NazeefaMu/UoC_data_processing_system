Decision is SL's sovereign Right: UNHR Chief
	
Says OHCHR recommends but the country?s sovereign right to decide
UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Prince Zeid Ra?ad Al Hussein said today that though the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) makes a recommendation on the judicial process into alleged war crimes or on the involvement of foreign judges, it was the sovereign right of Sri Lanka to decide.
He told a news conference held at the UN Office in Colombo, that the views of the Sri Lankan Government on foreign judges have been made known.
?But as we discussed this with them, we know that they are looking at various options within the limits of what they describe as their preference. Whatever that we see from our side, it?s your sovereign right to decide,? UNHR Chief said.
However, he said at the end of the day whatever Sri Lanka did, it should make sure that justice were served to all the victims, whose human rights have been violated.
?It?s not about what the UN says is good or bad. What matters at the end is that justice is served to victims whose parents, children and siblings had been lost. It is their determination what matters, that they are convinced that the government has done enough. And for that reason consultation is vital for Sri Lanka,? the UNHR Chief said.
He said Sri Lanka has many excellent judges, lawyers, and law enforcement officials but over the years the judiciary had become highly politicised, unbalanced and unreliable and that the country?s history over the past few decades had been littered with judicial failures and virtually all Sri Lankans recognize this.
?The Prime Minister has also commented on it at great length and with admirable candour, during a January 27 debate in Parliament. Virtually every week provides a new story of a failed investigation, a mob storming a court-room or another example of a crime going unpunished. Particularly, sexual violence and harassment against women and girls is poorly handled by the relevant State institutions -- especially when the alleged perpetrators are members of the military or security services -- and, as a result it remains all too widespread,? he said.
The UNHR Chief said it was for these reasons that the report and the Human Rights Council resolution suggested international participation in the accountability mechanisms set up to deal with international crimes and gross human rights violations committed by individuals on both sides.
?This is a practical proposal to solve the very real and practical problems I mentioned earlier. But it is only one aspect -- albeit a very important one -- of the broad range of measures outlined in the 2015 UN report and resolution and the extent to which it has been allowed to dominate the debate on Sri Lanka in recent days is unfortunate. Extreme nationalistic tendencies lay at the heart of Sri Lanka?s conflict, and they should not be allowed to undermine the country?s long term chances of recovery,? he said.
Meanwhile, when a journalist asked whether former President Mahinda Rajapaksa would be brought before an international war crimes court, the UNHR Chief said certain mechanisms should be established to confirm whether systemic violations or planned prosecution had been taken place.
?The process is a step by step one. There is no invocation of international investigation into alleged war crimes and that the judicial process is going to be a Sri Lankan one,? he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Nominating three names violates 19A: NMSJ
	
The National Movement for Social Justice (NMSJ) said today it was a violation of the 19th Amendment to the Constitution for the President to nominate three names to the post of Attorney General (AG).
??The Constitutional Council is only empowered to state whether the person nominated is suitable to be appointed to the post. It does not have the authority to select one official from among several others,? NMSJ member and Trade unionist Saman Rathnapriya told a media briefing held in Colombo.
Lawyer?s Collective representative Lakshan Dias said the AG?s Department was the state institution which implements the law and it should be headed by a very knowledgeable and competent official.
?Therefore we believe that the AG should be selected from among those at the AG?s department and that such an appointment should be in the order of seniority without political interference,? he said.
Lawyer Anura Bandara Rajaguru said the statement by MP Udaya Gammanpila calling for the appointment of Suhada Gamlath to the post of AG is politically biased and against the judicial process. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)

The judicial mechanism where the alleged war crimes committed by Sri Lankan tri-forces are to be examined, should be carried out in a Sri Lankan legal framework, Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka said yesterday.
?I emphasize that the Sri Lankan armed forces carried out the war in a legal manner to defeat LTTE terrorism. Hence we can say that these war crimes have been done by LTTE,? he said.
?Only an unbiased judicial system can solve these issues. We see this situation as an issue which should be get solved within the judicial system of Sri Lanka. It is not a mistake to get foreign expertise. But the decisions should be taken within the judicial system of Sri Lanka,? he added by answering to a question by the media. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)

We will continue our struggle: Dulles
	
Joint Opposition MP Dulles Alahapperuma said today that they would continue their struggle inside and outside parliament until the identity of the joint opposition was recognised, for the sake of the peoples? rights.
MP Alahapperuma said they had to stage a protest in parliament after their repeated requests during the last six months to recognise the joint opposition MPs as a separate group in parliament was not acceded to.
?We have had discussions with the speaker and the deputy speaker on 13 occasions on the subject, and have written three letters with regard to the discrimination against our MPs. We staged the protest only after such a long struggle. It was not a sudden decision,? he said.
Joint opposition MP Dinsesh Gunawardane said at a news conference that the speaker and the Prime Minister had accepted that the joint opposition had an issue in parliament with regard to their privileges and identity, and that it should be resolved.
Mr. Gunawardane asked, ?If they think that we have an issue, why do they not take action to grant our demands?? He added that it was up to the speaker to take a decision regarding that.
?The speaker has the power to grant our demands, if he accepts that our demands should be granted. A chaotic situation arose in parliament today as the speaker did not give a decision due to the influence of the government,? he said.
Mr. Gunawardane said it was regrettable that the speaker continued parliamentary proceedings without the participation of the joint opposition MPs. He said it was illegal to pass an act of parliament when a group of MPs were in the middle of the chamber.
MP Udaya Gammanpila said that the discrimination against the joint opposition MPs had become a matter of international concern and that the Inter-Parliament Union Secretary General Martin Chungong had replied to their letter and requested a detailed report on the discrimination against their MPs.
