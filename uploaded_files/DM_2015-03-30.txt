Archetyping beyond Warrior CEO
	
The 12 archetypes or patterns of behaviour identify the personality makeup and leadership style of chief executive officers (CEOs) and emerging leaders. Most CEOs only display their Warrior but each archetype has its positive and Shadow energies. Michel Nugawela explains how the key to matching personal strengths and competencies to executive roles and challenges is by integrating each of the 12 archetypes and making the unconscious conscious  or becoming aware of and transforming the Shadow side.What is an archetype
An archetype is a label or pattern that everyone is familiar with. Were always labelling people  for example, we attach the survivor label to someone who perseveres despite hardship or trauma in their life; the tyrant label to an authority figure who is oppressive or cruel; the outlaw label to a rebel or nonconformist. Were used to attaching labels to people; we just dont realize that were also archetyping them (people you meet every day are also archetyping you  they spot your patterns of behaviour and label them).
Each label or pattern or archetype is a mental category that represents a model of behaviour with both positive and negative energies. For example, we label our corporate leaders as Warriors and detect positive and negative patterns in their behaviour. The positive Warrior in the workplace displays mental toughness, professional competence, emotional control, realistic decision-making and motivates his or her colleagues to the highest levels of achievement.
But we also notice a Warrior pattern in the dark side of the archetype. This is the Shadow Warrior who exhibits the obsessive, ruthless and unprincipled need to win by gaining money, power and status over others with an anything goes mentality. Lalith Kotelawala scamming his Golden Key depositors is an example of the Shadow Warrior.How does archetyping help usWhen an archetype is active or dominant in your life, there is a very clear pattern to the way you behave. Once you understand the pattern, you can separate the person  yourself  from the pattern. You understand that the person is not the label  the person is being driven by an unconscious pattern of behaviour that either maximizes their potential or undercuts and limits their life.
The goal of archetyping is to make the unconscious conscious  to become conscious of your Shadow or the patterns of behaviour that unconsciously drive your life. When youre unaware or unconscious of this, you dont have any choice but to continue behaving as you always have done.
However, when you become conscious of the 12 archetypes and the positive and Shadow behaviours that drive each of them, you become aware or conscious of the core that motivates your perspective, thoughts, feelings and actions. When you become conscious, you immediately recognize your power to choose a new way of behaving.How does archetyping help CEOs and emerging leaders
Although we look at each of the archetypes sequentially  Innocent, Orphan, Warrior, Caregiver, Explorer, Lover, Destroyer, Creator, Ruler, Magician, Sage and Jester  the full developmental progression from one archetype to another through time isnt inevitable. In fact, this is why many CEOs get stuck in their Warrior archetype until their retirement or even the final day of their life.
They simply fail to integrate other archetypes that are essential to their leadership role and end up seeing the world only in terms of confrontation and rising to challenges  the standard Warrior perspective. This is also a significant cause of executive failure when the context or objective changes  you simply fail to see that the situation has changed and you need to think and behave differently.Could you provide examples of this
Take two examples from my work in branding. First, only a handful of Sri Lankan brands have successfully penetrated overseas markets and built global recognition and loyalty. With the exception of Dilmah, none of them are from fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG), which is the traditional territory of organisations with best-in-class processes and multi-channel strategies to reach consumers. This is baffling. For example, MASs lingerie brand Amante succeed in penetrating the Indian market while every Sri Lankan FMCG brand repeatedly failed.
This inability to perform and build brands in overseas markets tells us a lot about how our home-grown FMCG organisations think and behave. Second, the euphoria that followed the end of the war has not translated into new product and service innovations. Organisations have neither created new categories nor driven new growth. Instead, they continue to engage in head-to-head competition, adopt largely defensive positions with tactical strategies to retain existing market share in existing markets and even where they have attempted to innovate the results have been disappointing or disastrous.
The question is: why continue to operate  to think or behave  in exactly the same way as you did during the war years The answer is found in archetyping. CEOs, who are stuck in their Warrior, are unable to integrate other archetypes  especially their Creator and Magician  which would enable them to shift perspective and understand their potential or limitations in driving profitable growth by developing new innovations, categories and positions in both the domestic and overseas markets.
So, the existing trend is downward. Like any good Warrior or soldier they continue to fight on the frontlines over a shrinking share of the domestic pie. To see beyond this limited picture of price and volume-based competition, they need to integrate and activate their other archetypes.Can the Warrior archetype also help women leaders
The Warrior is the basic archetype of masculine psychology and has its roots in the hunter society of our early ancestors. The present day hunt is finding a job and channelling our Warrior energy to the workplace (as well as sports  and in the case of adolescents, to schools). The developmental skills the Warrior teaches us are important for any leader irrespective of their gender but women leaders today can greatly benefit from them because they operate in an aggressive Warrior culture driven by male norms and standards.Which international CEO best exemplifies the Warrior archetype
I know of several Sri Lankan CEOs who copy Steve Jobs so Ill use him as an example of how archetypes should be integrated to maximize our potential and effectiveness. Steve Jobs was a ruthless and controlling Warrior. Under his leadership, Apple had a brutal corporate culture driven by his desire for perfection. But Jobs was also a high-level Creator and Magician  without these archetypes, he would have lacked imagination, creativity and the high-level artistic control and skill that were needed to develop his iProduct innovations.
Sri Lankan CEOs who copy Jobs aggressive Warrior behaviour are copying his Warrior archetype, which is only one part of a 12-chapter story. So the lesson is clear: as a leader you cannot remain only a Warrior. You must integrate your other archetypes.

Fast-tracking your way up the corporate ladder A great leader builds an enduring legacy that goes be
	
As leaders, the most important thing we must understand is the nature of our impact on others and the factors that compose our career legacies. This legacy is composed of three parts: the first two are through our decisions and our successes. These two factors have been extensively reviewed during the past weeks.
The good thing about these two factors is that, finally, both of them are measurable. The result could be modest share gain, profits, sales, territory capture, etc. Time will tell whether your decisions were solid and whether your execution was a success.
The third factor is your reputation. This is what your followers and others think and will say about you after you exit your position. Reputation is the basis of leadership, no matter the job. It is built over many years, one word at a time, one action at a time, one deed at time. In leadership, a few things matter more. Reputation is among the most treasured and powerful assets. Your reputation is yours, very personal but also very easy to lose.
When one day your followers will look back at their time spent with you, they will reflect on four things that created the taste left in their mouths. (1) Reward  Were they acknowledged for their commitment and the accomplishments Were they recognised both publicly and personally (2) Respect  Were they appreciated for their service and sacrifice, both publicly and privately (3) Award  Were they credited appropriately for their contributions to success It may be money, citations, promotions, career opportunities and new challenges. (4) Education (Did they learn valuable lessons being the part of the team Have they progressively improved their knowledge on products/services they sell, management skills, social skills, etc.
These are tough issues, because they require some generosity on your part. It becomes still more difficult because all these factors will put great pressure on you to lead your team well.Different preferences
The great British banker and financier Nathan Rothschild noted that the more unpredictable the environment, the greater the opportunityif you have the leadership skills to capitalize on it. During the past eight months, we have identified nine skills that, when mastered and used in concert, allow leaders to think strategically and navigate the unknown effectively: the abilities to anticipate, challenge, interpret, decide, align and learn. Each has received attention in the leadership literature but usually in isolation and seldom in the special context of high stakes and deep uncertainty that can make or break both companies and careers.
Different people have different preferences or built-in reactions, to change. This preference drives a large part of the change response, regardless of the situation or the specific change itself. Leaders who pay attention to change preference can better understand why people react the way they do when faced with change. These leaders are more prepared to address concerns, leverage different contributions, avoid pitfalls  and adapt their own change approach as needed.Three types
During his career, this writer has identified three different types of people: Conservers, Originators and Pragmatics. Conservers are people who accept the current structure, systems and processes. They prefer slow incremental change over sweeping, expansive change or dramatic new directions. They appear deliberate, disciplined and focused and are good at defining and clarifying current reality. To the outside world, they may appear cautious and inflexible.
Originators like to challenge current structures, systems and processes. They enjoy taking risks and tend to focus on new possibilities, vision and direction. Originators are action-minded and likely to challenge assumptions. They appear visionary but also may seem impractical or miss important details.
Pragmatists tend to focus on getting the job done. They prefer change that is functional and are willing to explore changing structures, systems and processes. They often see merit in the perspectives of both conservers and originators and are motivated to find solutions. To others, they may appear practical, agreeable and flexible  or indecisive and trying to please too many people at one time.
If you are a team leader, knowing the change preference of others allows you to tailor your change communication and influence approach. For example, direct reports, who are conservers, need more information and more time to accept a change than the originators. Originators need help moving from the idea toward action. And the pragmatists may feel stuck in the middle and overly relied upon to mediate.Matrix
Learning of these three types of people, we come across two questions. How can we really understand people and the human nature Why do some people act in a weird way and what is the nature of their behaviour The main reason people fail to understand others is not that some people act weirdly or in a strange way but its because most people arent aware of their own human nature.
By learning how to look at the underlying reason behind certain behaviour and by learning how to not judge others without seeing the full picture, you will certainly understand people better. By understanding your own human nature and the thinking patterns that result from it, you will certainly understand people with very little effort.
Most people exhibit one of the four emotions during their important occasions. (1) Happy: Getting what they want. (2) Mad: Not getting what they want in the present (3) Sad: Have not received what they wanted in the past (4) Scared: Believing they wont get what they want in the future.
Commit to knowledge this little matrix and you will immediately find yourself looking underneath the anger, disappointment or the fear it find the event that caused the emotion of the person in front of you.
This is how the best leaders control their leadership reputation. They break themselves apart and put themselves back together again with greater clarity of purpose and responsibility to those they serve.
Your leadership reputation is totally in your hands. If you are well-intentioned about genuinely serving the needs of others, then you will not only have a leg-up on managing your reputation, you will also begin to advance your own career.
This is the formulae for leaving a great legend. This is the formulae followed by other great leaders. There are no shortcuts. You have to recognise the right things to do while you are leading. Just the right things!
If you have read carefully the 32-part of this series carefully and understood the essential skills the progressive leader needs to develop, you are in the right path. If you live on these skills, they will eventually produce the best results, most productive team and the greatest chance for success. As an added attribute, they will also contribute to your reputation and the legacy you wish to leave behind.(Lionel Wijesiri, a corporate director with over 25 years senior managerial experience, can be contacted atlionwije@live.com)

Fitch affirms Siyapatha Finance at A(lka)
	
		 		 
		 
			
Fitch Ratings Lanka has affirmed Siyapatha Finance PLCs (SLFL) National Long-Term Rating at A(lka). The Outlook is Stable. The agency has also affirmed SLFLs outstanding senior unsecured debentures at National Long-Term Rating A(lka) and outstanding subordinated debentures at A-(lka).
SLFLs ratings reflect Fitchs view that support would be forthcoming from its parent, Sampath Bank PLC (AA-(lka)/Stable), which owns 100 percent of SLFL, if needed. SLFL is rated two notches below its parent because the bank continues to fully own SLFL and is involved in the strategic direction of SLFL through board representation. SLFL benefits from funding from its parent which accounted for 15 percent of SLFLs total borrowings at end-2014.However, Fitch expects the share of deposit funding to increase as the entity commences deposit mobilization having obtained the status of Licensed Finance Company (LFC) in 2013.
The two notch differential also reflects SLFLs limited role in the group with leasing accounting for just 4 percentof group advances at end-2014, of which SLFL provided only 29 percent.
Since its conversion to a LFC, SLFL ceased to share a common brand with its parent while branches situated within Sampath Banks premises have also decreased. SLFLs contribution to group profit remains low, averaging 5 percent of group profit for the three years from 2012 to 2014. Fitch does not view a potential disposal of SLFL, which is not being planned, as being material to the group. Fitch expects that SLFL can continue to rely on its parent for capital to support strong loan growth. SLFLs capitalisation, measured as the ratio of Fitch core capital to weighted risk assets, decreased to 13.8% at end-2014 from 22.5% at end-2011.
SLFLs outstanding senior debentures are rated at the same level as SLFLs National Long-Term Rating, as they constitute direct, unconditional, unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of the company.
SLFLs subordinated debentures are rated one notch below SLFLs National Long-Term Rating to reflect their subordination to senior unsecured creditors.

Fitch upgrades AMCL to BBB+(lka)
	
		 		 
		 
			
Fitch Ratings Lanka has upgraded Sri Lanka-based AMW Capital Leasing and Finance PLCs (AMCL) National Long-Term Rating to BBB+(lka) from BB-(lka).
The Outlook is Stable. The multiple-notch upgrade follows Fitchs assessment of support from its 90 percent-parent, Associated Motorways Limited (AMW).
AMCLs rating reflects Fitchs view that support would be forthcoming from AMW, given the finance companys strategic importance to the latter.
This assessment is based on AMCLs role in group, given strong synergies and operational integration. While its share of financing of AMWs vehicle sales has remained moderate, AMCL accounted for a substantial share of group profit and assets at end-2014. About 46 percent of its advances comprised vehicle finance facilities provided to its parents clients (2013: 49 percent).
AMW is involved in the strategic direction of AMCL, having three out of nine seats on AMCLs board and through the involvement of current senior managers, including the Managing Director of AMW.
Fitch believes that additional incentives for AMW to provide support to AMCL stem from the common AMW brand, which could have high reputational impact on AMW should AMCL default. Of AMCLs 17 branches, 10 are based within AMW branches. In addition AMCLs funding relies on the parent, which provided 67 percent of AMCLs borrowings at end-2014.
AMWs rating factors in its modest credit profile, and its stable and strong market share in the import and distribution of new vehicles in Sri Lanka, particularly through products from the Maruti Suzuki brands that are aimed at price-conscious consumers. These vehicles are more likely to be sold in greater volumes through macroeconomic cycles compared with high-end products where import duties and indirect taxes are higher.
AMCLs rating is sensitive to changes in its parents ability and propensity to provide support.
AMCLs rating may be downgraded if AMCLs size relative to AMW increases and if its operations become more independent of that of its parent.
AMWs rating could be downgraded if there is a weakening of its financial profile, including its leverage as measured by adjusted net debt/ EBITDAR, a sustained reduction in the market share of vehicle brands such as Maruti Suzuki, or a material dilution in the relationship between AMW and its automotive end-brands, particularly Maruti Suzuki. AMWs rating may be upgraded if there is a sustained increase in its market share in brand new vehicle sales in Sri Lanka.

Peoples Bank posts best ever financial results in 53 years
	
5Best ever profitability with PAT increasing 89.9%5Impressive Rs 1 tn Balance Sheet5Group Profit before Tax exceeds Rs.21bn

Peoples Bank closed 2014 with an impressive performance, attesting that it continues to remain the Pulse of the People. 
Posting the milestone of Rs 1 trillion in its balance sheet, only the second bank in Sri Lanka to do so, Peoples Bank also notched the best profitability for a year end, since its inception in 1961. 
Augmenting its balance sheet of Rs 1 trillion, this years Profit Before Tax inclined 67.2 percent to stand at Rs 17,231 million, while Profit After Tax was pushed upwards by an impressive 89.9 percent displayed at Rs 14,219 million.  The Banks financial performance for 2014 is unequivocally impressive. Net Interest Income is posted at Rs 30,118 million, while the Net Interest Margin reached 3.1 percent, despite the entire banking industry battling the downward pressure exerted on interest rates. Gross Interest Income reached Rs 84,480 million, compared to Rs 110,441 million last year, primarily due to this decline in interest rates, coupled with the downsizing of the pawning portfolio. Interest Expense stands at Rs 54,362 million against last years Rs 73,791 million with the decrease attributed to the cascading impacts of declining interest rates and replacing of higher cost deposits with low cost saving deposits growth.
Observing the details of the impressive Rs 1 trillion balance sheet, Gross Loans and Advances reached Rs 685,310 million by end 2014, indicating an incline of 0.6 percent. With the permeating global gold crisis impacting the pawning industry significantly from 2013 onwards, the Bank was prudent and instituted some dynamics to decrease its exposure which emerged at 16.6 percent in 2014 of the total Gross Loans, which in 2013 stood at a high of 28.9 percent. Pawning balance reached Rs 113,946 million indicating a reduction of Rs 83,183 million in comparison to last year. The Bank focused emphatically on broadening its lending portfolio, heralding an increase to 87,026 million in lending to other customers. 
With probably the countrys largest savings base now exceeding Rs 318 billion with increasing customer confidence, deposits reached Rs 793,342 million indicating a 4.1 percent improvement over 2013. 
Commenting on the groundbreaking results, Chairman Hemasiri Fernando said, Possessing one of the largest customer bases in Sri Lanka of over 16 million, the Bank has proven repeatedly that its unique brand of banking by the people, for the people is the formula to its success. We also continue being the most accessible bank in Sri Lanka, possessing the widest branch network.  CEO/General Manager N. Vasantha Kumar adds that, Being a state owned bank, we have an ingrained responsibility to ensure that our stakeholders trust and confidence is consistent, strong and enduring. This means, that our focus should not only centered on a quantitative sense, though important, as seen in our impressive results, but also in the qualitative dynamics we continue to infuse through the decisions we make. Whatever we do, the impact on our stakeholders must be positive.
The Chairman who has an ambitious yet achievable vision for Peoples Bank, given its repeatedly proven prowess at being a champion and leader, has earmarked the Bank to be the Most Digitalised Bank in Sri Lanka. As we observe, both the country and the world is undergoing transformation and the Bank has remained abreast of those transformations.
