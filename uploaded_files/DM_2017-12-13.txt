All his whiskey gone down the drain
	

A Blue purohita who had vowed to team up with the JO group has, in a surprise move, decided to stick with yahapalanaya, they say.

The first to react with anger and disappointment at the volte face by the nap-loving Blue purohita was a Diyawanna member from the Puttalam district who rushed to the former strongman to open up his heart to him. Sir, what a double gamer this fellow is! It was he who urged me to quit yahapalanaya and it was at a meeting held at his residence that they decided that I should be the first to quit. And I acted true to that decision and now he had decided to hold on to his office and perks!
Encouraged by a sympathetic nod by the former strongman, the member continued: I took dozens of whiskey bottles to his residence on the days we met there to discuss our future plans. All in vain!

Alls well that ends well
	

The Pohottuwa leaders recently had occasion to witness a spat between a teacher and a pupil at their headquarters.

The exchange got so heated, the teacher  the former tuition master  nearly walked out in a huff, they say.
The former tuition master and his talkative pupil of pure heritage fame were involved in a discussion over the selection of nominees to be fielded on the Pohottuwa list at the upcoming polls when the latter flared up over the poor quota allocated to his political party.
However, the other Pohottuwa bigwigs present intervened and settled the issue to the satisfaction of both parties.
In fact, the Pohottuwa leaders had a pleasant surprise when the pure heritage pupil went down on his knees and worshipped the former tuition master by way of his peace offering.

Appreciation: Gerard Palitha Gunasekera The founder of FRIENDS is no more
	
Gerard Palitha Gunasekera was born on 13th December 1961. He was the 8th out of nine siblings. His father was a Major in the Sri Lanka Army and his mother a housewife. Palitha attended St.Benedicts College, Kotahena, since the school was in close proximity to the family home. His entire school career was at St.Benedicts where he made many friends the majority remaining lifelong buddies. 
By nature Palitha was an easy going, fun-loving individual with an infectious smile. But his greatest asset was his pure heart. His leadership qualities along with honesty and integrity added to his strengths. He was always looking to lend a helping hand to others  including people he met for the very first time. 
Palithas personality attracted people whenever and wherever he went. He also had the rare ability to win over even strangers of all ages and walks of life with his charming smile and affable personality. People who met him for the first time became friends with thischarismatic person. 
While still at school, Palitha decided to join the Colombo YMCA  one of the most important decisions he made in his life. His leadership qualities blossomed at the YMCA Youth Department where he persuaded some of his school mates to join him. And together with other members, Palitha started a host of new programmes and activities that attracted more youth to the YMCA. His rapid climb to the position of the Youth Work Secretary was an early testament to his people-handling skills. Although Palitha was a devout Catholic, he enjoyed learning and respecting other religions and cultural traditions too. 
In 1986, Palitha formed FRIENDS  an organisation to support underprivileged youth in Sri Lanka to overcome social barriers. It targeted financially insecure school going children deprived of parental love living in care centres run by Government and the private sector. Even today, more than 30 years after its inauguration, Palitha Gunasekeras inspiration, FRIENDS continues to have a positive impact on the lives of the disadvantaged youth of Sri Lanka. 
Palitha took another important decision; this time to settle down in Australia. Based in Sydney, he initially worked in the banking sector and later ended up employed in the Australian government railway. Although he became an Australian citizen, Palitha also held citizenship of Sri Lanka. With the backing of his Sri Lankan colleagues Palitha formed the first ever overseas branch of FRIENDS in Sydney in 2000. 
FRIENDS will be dedicating the 13th SENEHASA YOUTH LEADERSHIP CAMP for disadvantaged youth from 15th to 17th December 2017 to the late founder at the Lama Sevana Childrens Home , Halpathota, Baddegama. 
From time to time he used to visit his motherland and renewed old friendships; he never forgot FRIENDS and its beneficiaries either. With the loyal support of his most trusted friends and colleagues, back in Sri Lanka, he revived FRIENDS in 2008 by holding a 3-day residential camp for over a hundred children. The success of that effort prompted him to visit Sri Lanka more often and to stay for longer periods. 
In the year 2014 Palitha was instrumental in organising a memorable charity dinner dance in Sydney to raise funds for FRIENDS. The record turnout and financial collection at this event made Palitha the happiest individual that night. 
During the last few years of his life, he travelled to most parts of Sri Lanka and experienced conditions and situations as never before. He became an avid nature lover and enjoyed outdoor life and visited wildlife and nature parks. 
Palithas love and affection for his mother was unlimited. It was the main-perhaps the only reason he went back to Australia at least once a year. It is rarely in ones life that one comes across a human being of exceptional and rare qualities such as Palitha. Those who associated closely with him can count themselves lucky. 
The greatest respect we can pay Palitha is by continuing to engage in the good deeds he did. It is the least we as a grateful public, friends and colleagues could do to carry
forward his legacy.
Gerard Palitha Gunasekera left this world on 4th September 2016 in Sydney. 
FRIENDS will be dedicating the 13th SENEHASA YOUTH LEADERSHIP CAMP for disadvantaged youth from 15th to 17th December 2017 to the late founder at the Lama Sevana Childrens Home , Halpathota, Baddegama.

CEB unions threaten strike over several demands
	
Following a discussion with officials of the Power and Renewable Energy Ministry today, the CEB Joint Trade Union Alliance said it would take action if its demands were not met by tomorrow.
Speaking to Daily Mirror, Joint Trade Union Alliance General Secretary Ranjan Jayalal said the Ministry Secretary accepted its demands.
"Ministry Secretary accepted our demands and said the final decision will be taken after the matter was discussed with the minister tomorrow. Also, the annual allowances and bonuses of non-executive employees have been curtailed. However, several officials have allegedly increased their allowances. The hunger strike launched by CEB employees will continue until their demands are met. The union will not resort to an indefinite islandwide strike because it could inconvenience the ongoing GCE O/L exams. However, in the event our demands are not met, we will certainly launch the strike after the exams are over, he said.
When contacted Power and Renewable Energy Ministry Director (Development), Sulakshana Jayawardena, he confirmed that the ministry officials met with the trade union leaders.
"A solution to their demands will be provided tomorrow, after consulting the minister," he said. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

Europes five biggest economies warn Trump
	

(Daily Mail), 12 December 2017 - Europes five biggest economies have warned Donald Trump that plans for massive US tax reforms may end up violating international trade rules. 
Finance ministers from Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Spain say they have significant concerns about some of the US Presidents tax initiatives and fear they could harm the global economy.
In a letter to US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, the ministers said the tax overhaul could risk seriously hampering genuine trade and investment flows between Europe and America.Their warning mirrors fears among some European businesses that aspects of Mr Trumps tax-reform bills may have been designed to give American companies an advantage over foreign rivals.
The ministers, including Britains chancellor Philip Hammond, warned the measures could discriminate in a manner which would contravene World Trade Organisation (WTO) provisions, would be inconsistent with double taxation rules, and would be poorly targeted at helping to combat tax avoidance.

FMM fights for Media professionalism in Sri Lanka
	
Many professions in Sri Lanka enjoy social respect; why not the media
In June 1992, the Free Media Movement (FMM) was formed by a group of journalists and media activists with the purpose of creating a safe environment for journalists and an environment for freedom of expression.
The organization turned 25 this year and as the landmark event of its 25th anniversary, the FMM held a National Summit on Free Media Culture with Social Responsibility on November 21, 2017 at the Lakshman Kadirgamar Institute. Many print, electronic and online media personnel, activists, policy decision makers and academics were present at the event where discussions on the struggle to end the animosity against journalists in Sri Lanka and a collaborative approach to media reforms and future challengeswere held. 
It should be accepted that Sri Lankan media men especially provincial correspondents are confronting challenges in lack of media professionalism and the sustainability of media institutes. It is essential to strengthen media professionalism as it makes media personnel understand how to use the given freedom properly
One of its founding members Lakshman Gunasekara referring to the emergence of media suppression in the late 1980s, spoke about a need for a strong media movement in order to urge authorities to restore freedom of expression and ensure the safety of journalists. He said what made the FMM different from other media organizations was its contribution and the instances where it had stood against not only issues pertaining to journalists, but to all groups in society. 
Emphasizing the importance of media professionalism, FMM Convener C.Dodawatta said it is essential to strengthen media professionalism because it makes media personnel understand the manner in which the given freedom is used without abusing it but responsibly in the role of a watch dog. 
There are two sides of this issue. What we can do to solve the issue as a media organization is actually limited to some extent. It should be accepted that Sri Lankan media men especially provincial correspondents are confronting challenges in lack of media professionalism and the sustainability of media institutes. It is essential to strengthen media professionalism as it makes media personnel understand how to use the given freedom properly, he said. 
According to him, the FMM had organized a number of training programmes and awareness programmes for provincial correspondents and reporters from rural areas. The programmes incorporated media ethics, standards and safety practices of the media and investigative reporting. Currently, there are four programmes being held in four provinces covering methods of investigative reporting. 
He went on to say: All the members of the FMM are working on a volunteer basis. It adds to the fact that there are limited resources and also a limited output that our organization could provide. But, we are trying our best to make the greatest impact. 
Ownership is probably the greatest influence on that issue. Support and contribution of media institutes is in a sorry state. Proprietors of media institutions also have a responsibility in terms of professional training
Dodawatta stressed that a national policy should be introduced to recognize professionalism of media personnel. Policy decisions should be made by the authorities with regard to this. Media literacy is not provided even in schools. If it can be made a practical subject rather than involving theoretical aspects, the root of many issues can be resolved. Attitudes should be changed on how to maintain standards and ethics whileworking as journalists. 
He was of the view that a half-baked professional who will certainly malfunction is akin to a faulty machine that cannot give a correct out-put.  He added; Ownership is probably the greatest influence on that issue. Support and contribution of media institutes is in a sorry state. Proprietors of media institutions also have a responsibility in terms of professional training.  He also said that media institutes in the country should prioritize initiatives to enhance media professionalism through the implementation of more coordinated approaches to human resource development.
He underscored that by saying there is a handful of media institutes that are maintained genuinely as media institutes. 
They are not run on charity but investments that must yield profit to their owners. Some of the owners set up these media organizations in the country for political reasons. Some others engage in the media to launder black money. Proprietors of such media institutes dont bother about the professionalism of their journalists and reporters. Owners have used it as a means of satisfying their quest for power and wealth. It is enough for them to get their work done by journalists, Dodawatta remarked. 
Another founding member of the FMM, Seetha Ranjanee was of the view that there needs to be an institute parallel in function to an administrative board to address issues related tomedia personnel. 
All such issues will be addressed once professionalism of media personnel is established. Societys attitudes towards journalists will also be changed thereafter. Welfare issues such as salaries of journalists should be backed by trade unions which I think have a major role to play in pressurizing the relevant authorities to do what is required, she said. 
A number of major media institutes were closed in the last few months. Does anyone care how many journalists lost their livelihoods Journalists are left at cross roads in the country from choosing between professionalism and survival. Amidst such confusion the non-payment of salaries to journalists has also arisen when due. This is despite the fact the salaries are not enough to take care of the basic needs of the journalists. These issues were not even a topic among other media personnel. 
When we were informed about welfare issues, we instructed them and proposed to make a collective movement in order to demand for their rights from the heads of the institutions that employ them. Sadly, that is exactly what our journalists are lacking; collective [bargaining] and unity. Each tries to make individual attempts to save their own jobs. Since many media institutes are begun with different agendas in view, once their agenda is completed or if they realize obstacles or difficulties are hard to face, they give up the projects and shut down the institutes, leaving dozens of journalists helpless and jobless, Ranjanee said. 
Various professions the world over have carved identities for themselves which they depend on for pride and prestige. Highlighting the major role that the government has to play in establishing professionalism of journalists, she said that the relevant authorities should ensure that social respect given to other professions is given to the media as well. 
A number of major media institutes were closed in the last few months. Does anyone care how many journalists lost their livelihoods Journalists are left at cross roads in the country from choosing between professionalism and survival
Dodawatta, responding to a question regarding allegations levelled against the FMM, said since the beginning, the FMM has received financial support from various Non-Governmental Organizations and donors for its projects and programmes and that the FMM membership did not see anythingwrong in it. 
It is not important to talk about the source of income but what is done using that money. The FMM has done quite a lot good stuff. Obtaining foreign funds should not be a problem because even the Sri Lanka government receives financial support from rich countries. Individually, FMM members are not financially strong to bear all the expenses of the organization. It is indeed a common feature in organizational culture to accept any financial support for its progress when offered, he said.

Geminid Meteorites to shower SL skies tonight
	
A meteoric shower can be seen from tonight until next Sunday, the Director of the Astronomy and Space Science Unit of the Department of Physics of the Colombo University said.
Prof. Jayaratne said this was an annual occurrence known as the Geminids Meteor Shower will be best seen this year from Sri Lanka. Every year this meteoric shower occurs on the same dates between December 4 and17 December reaching the peek on December 13 or 14.
However, this year because of the absence of moonlight till early morning one could see more meteorites. If the sky is clear and dark with no city light pollution you might be able to see about 120 meteories per hour. That is about one or two meteorites a minute, he said. "To observe these meteorites, one must look east after 9 p.m. today, overhead at midnight and towards the west before sunrise on December 14. The best time to look is during the dark hours before sunrise on December 14 from about 2 a.m. to 4 a.m. because that is when the showers radiant point is highest in the sky and the peak activity occurs."
Prof. Jayaratne said no binoculars or telescopes were needed to see the shower. This meteorite shower is well-known for its multi-coloured display with tracks of light seen in several colours like white, yellow, green, blue, and red.
"These shooting stars appear to be coming from the direction of the star constellation Gemini and therefore came to be known as Geminid. The Geminid meteorite shower has a broad peak, so observers should see meteorites even on the 14th," Prof. Jayaratne said. (Sandun A. Jayasekera)

Google to open AI centre in China despite restrictions
	
Google is deepening its push into Artificial Intelligence (AI) by opening a research centre in China, even though its search services remain blocked in China, BBC reported today.
Google has said the facility would be the first of its kind in Asia and would aim to employ local talent.
China has also indicated strong support for AI development and for catching up with the US.
Research into artificial intelligence has the potential to improve a range of technologies, from self-driving cars and automated factories to translation products and facial recognition software.
In a blog post on the company's website, Google said the new research centre was an important part of its mission as an "AI first company".
"Whether a breakthrough occurs in Silicon Valley, Beijing or anywhere else, AI has the potential to make everyone's life better for the entire world," said Fei-Fei Li, Chief Scientist at Google Cloud AI and Machine Learning.
The research centre, which joins similar facilities in London, New York, Toronto and Zurich, will be run by a small team from its existing office in Beijing.
Google operates two offices in China, with roughly half of its 600 employees working on global products, company spokesperson Taj Meadows has told AFP.
However, Google's search engine and a number of other services are banned in China.
China has for many years censored content it sees as politically sensitive, using an increasingly sophisticated set of filters that critics have called the "great firewall".
At the same time, China has been expanding its push into artificial intelligence. Last week, President Xi Jinping urged senior officials to "accelerate implementation of big data".
In July, China announced its national plan for AI calling for the country to catch up with the US. However, Human rights groups are critical of China's use of artificial intelligence to monitor its own citizens.

Govt. to control milk powder importation: Harrison
	
The government is to take steps to control the importation of milk powder and ban the importation of substandard milk powder from abroad in order to encourage the local dairy farmers and promote the dairy farming in Sri Lanka, Rural Economic Affairs Minister P. Harrison said.
Issuing a press release, he stated that several incidents were being reported that the local dairy farmers had experienced losses owing to the importation of milk powder from abroad.
We in collaboration with the Sri Lanka Standards Institution are going to introduce a labeling system on the dairy products including yogurt, ice cream so that the consumer could distinguish local dairy products from substandard products. We are going to make it compulsory soon. It should be labeled on the products whether the products are manufactured using local dairy or imported milk powder, Harrison said.
He further said that the government would promote the products made of fresh milk to discourage consumption of milk powder which are being imported. (Sheain Fernandopulle)

Haggling over nominations!
	

Sparks flew at the Green partys Colombo district nominations selection committee which met the other day when the Tree party bigwigs insisted on being given a lions share on the city list. The Tree party leaders had argued that the Muslim vote being the decisive factor given the large concentration of Muslims in the city their party deserved more candidates on the joint list.

Mariks from Kolonnawa who took exception to the stand taken by the Tree party leaders warned them not to play the communal card that they had been playing in the East. Dont try to stoke communal flames here in Colombo! Sinhalese, Tamils and Muslims are living in perfect harmony in the Colombo. Dont try to create unnecessary trouble here, he told the Tree big guns.
As tempers and tensions ran high, the members of the nominations committee had to put aside their main task and make a bid to bring about a measure of conciliation among the participants who were yelling at one another in anger.

Has he got an ace up his sleeve
	

There were news stories galore in the recent past about the moves being made by a section of the Blue party to bring the JO group back into the party fold. However, it may be news to many in the country that even a business sibling of a very high political party had been burning midnight oil in a bid to bring the Pohottuwa into the Betel leaf alliance.

Fired with the zeal for his political mission the business sibling had been in constant touch with Pohottuwa big guns making proposals one after another like a typical peace maker. When all his overtures failed to draw a positive response, someone knowledgeable had told him that there was no sense in talking peace to all and sundry in Pohottuwa party and that his mission would end in failure unless he got round the former strongmans political sibling.
The business sibling was practically a stranger to the political sibling, but he decided to take the bull by the horns. He tried to contact him over the phone. He kept on calling the political sibling, but got no response.
The business sibling is not a man who gets easily discouraged. He has reportedly worked out a new plan of action aimed at merging the Pohottuwa with the Betel leaf alliance.
A few nuts and bolts of the new action plan are likely to come into limelight in the near future, an informed source said.

ILLICIT LIQUOR RACKETEERS RULE THE ROOST IN NITTAMBUWAWhy is the Police ineffective
More stories of injustice meted out to the public by the police established to maintain law and order are rapidly spreading. These stories have raised much concern within a section of the society. Many views have been expressed in the recent past regarding the actions taken by the so called commissions during such situations. 
The Anti Vice Unit of the Nittambuwa Police had been striving hard to end this evil trade.
	Certain senior police officers were also supporting these racketeers
	The house was leased to a group of Chinese nationals
	After the case that followed Rs 10,000 was awarded to my mother as compensation for the lost finger
In one of the most recent incidents the police were taken to task by the court for acting in a manner that proved their ignorance of the basic laws of the country. This was regarding the incident where a foreign tourist was awarded compensation. This story reveals the lackadaisical attitude of certain police personnel, serving the Nittambuwa Police Station, in conducting investigations and bringing to book a gang of illicit liquor (Kassippu) distillers. These businessmen have taken the law into their hands and work hand in glove with the police. 
The protagonist of this story a lady had been attached to a media institution and moved with her family to a house in Nimahetikanda in Nittambuwa in 2012. This area was well-known for the illicit liquor trade. A well organized racket relating to illicit liquor distilling and distribution was taking place prominently. The Anti Vice Unit of the Nittambuwa Police had been striving hard to end this evil trade. But as the racketeers were strengthened by political power the law enforcement officers were helpless. Certain senior police officers were also supporting these racketeers. 
Successful raid
Whenever the inmates of the house were confronted by these racketeers, the woman occupying the house had lodged a complaint with the police by calling119.
This house which was vacant for some time had been the place where the illicit liquor had been kept concealed. The family that moved into this house wasnt aware of this illegal activity. The daily operation of these racketeers got affected with the house now being occupied. However, the racketeers were determined to carry on with their activities. Whenever the inmates of the house were confronted by these racketeers, the woman occupying the house had lodged a complaint with the police by calling119. Due to repeated calls by her the police raiding party came out with the idea of visiting the house as civilians.
The police personnel wanted to spend time at this home as friends of the householders. The inmates couldnt refuse the suggestion made by the police and conceded. Towards the end of 2014 a raid was conducted successfully. The racketeers, after coming to know the Modus Operandi of this police team, were hellbent on taking revenge. 
On Christmas day back in 2014 the racketeers, fueled by the leadership provided by a Civil Defense Force member, arrived at the house and assaulted the womens father, who had complained to the police against the racketeers.
Her mother intervened in the incident and as a result lost one of her fingers. The police were informed again with the householders calling 119. The householders faced threats and experienced much harassment following this incident. They had no alternative, but to lease the house in August. The house was leased to a group of Chinese nationals. The householders meanwhile moved into a half completed house belonging to the family and situated in a nearby land. 
Contractors intimidated
According to this lady, on the very day her family had moved in, a villager, fully intoxicated with liquor, had arrived brandishing a knife and scolded her father
On October 2 her eight-year-old child had been playing outside when a villager had scolded him. When this woman had gone there an argument had arisen and the villager had twisted her hand. She had grabbed a cricket bat and had pushed the villager aside using the wooden object. She had then reported the matter to the police by calling 119. The Nittambuwa Police had responded saying that it wasnt necessary to visit their station. However about an hour later the law enforcement officers had summoned her to the Police station. She had then gone to the police station accompanied by her father and a brother and visited the crime unit. She was surprised with the presence of a group of villagers at the police station. 
Revealing her story she said that the house in question was purchased by her after seeing an advertisement in the newspaper, way back in 2012. We observed that the house had been vacant for quite some time. After having purchased this property we came to know that this was a centre from where illicit liquor racketeers operated. After purchasing the house we entrusted the renovation work to a contractor. He declined to continue with the work saying that some outsiders were intimidating him. Several other contractors too were unable to attend to this work and finally we were compelled to occupy the house despite repairs not being completed, she said.
According to this lady, on the very day her family had moved in, a villager, fully intoxicated with liquor, had arrived brandishing a knife and scolded her father. Acting on a call I made to the Police, via119, a Police officer from Nittambuwa visited us and in our presence admonished this person. We didnt pursue with the matter, but stones were hurled at our house. They had even poisoned the fish in our outdoor tank. Even the dogs were not spared, she reminisced. 
The family had later managed to purchase a 62-perch land which was opposite this house. However, the villagers werent at all pleased with their action. 
CCTV cameras
While the family was at the police station another crowd had surrounded their house. The SI who spoke to her via telephone had assured her that no such incident had occurred
The incident that took place on the night of Christmas day in 2014 was brought to the notice of the police. After the case that followed Rs 10,000 was awarded to the mother as compensation for the lost finger. The assailant was acquitted on condition that he wouldnt create any problems for this family. Later they had installed CCTV cameras in the house and the situation returned to normalcy. 
Another incident took place on October 2 when another villager, who had come near the house where her son was playing, had threatened them stating that these lands belonged to them. The villager had abused the family in foul language. When she had responded by stating that the police would be informed of his behavior, he had retorted, The Police are our friends. They eat and drink with us. You get it done if you can. At the police station, in front of the officers of the crime division, the men had shouted stating that they must chase these people (The lady and her family) away and set fire to their house.
While the family was at the police station another crowd had surrounded their house. The SI who spoke to her via telephone had assured her that he is also residing close by and no such incident had occurred. During this telephone conversation the woman had overheard the SI telling someone Ask them to leave. This conversation has been recorded by the woman. 
When she had returned home she found that some household articles were damaged and the house had been set on fire. The house that was let out to the Chinese had also been damaged. When she dialed the Nittambuwa Police (using the number 0332297255) and informed about the latest developments the policeman had said, How can that happen when the villagers are here.
Repeated calls had been taken to the OIC of the Nittambuwa Police, but they went unanswered. According to the family whenever they called the police to inform that a group of people was damaging the house or assaulting the family they (Police) never believed them and always exonerated the wrongdoers. 
The family had brought this grave injustice to the attention of the IGPs Public Complaints Centre, Police Commission and the Human Rights authorities. It appears that these steps taken by the aggrieved woman had antagonized some police personnel at the Nittambuwa Police Station. Countering her moves, the suspects involved had filed counter complaints saying that the woman assaulted an individual with a cricket bat.
Meanwhile her sons education has been hampered as his schoolbooks have been burnt and her mother, who has suffered mentally as a result of this issue, is now under treatment at the mental hospital. The house she had built after mortgaging her property has now been reduced to ashes. 
The taped conversation she had with a police officer in Nittambuwa is proof of how nasty this police has been to her. 
Despite the harassment she has experienced and the refusal by the police of Nittambuwa to bring the culprits to book, she says that all police officers are not behaving in this manner and there are many good men in the Police Department.

Investigations are continuing 
When contacted Police spokesperson Ruwan Gunasekare said that a complaint had been made regarding this incident to the Senior SSP Gampaha Police and the IGP special unit that entertains public complaints. The complaint made to the Senior SSP Gampaha Police has been forwarded to be taken for hearing by the Assistant SSP Attanagalla.

Is Ram Setu man-made or myth
	

New Delhi (Hindustan Times), 12 Dec 2017 - Are the ancient Hindu myths of a land bridge connecting India and Sri Lanka true Scientific analysis suggests they are, claims the promo of a show called Ancient Land Bridge to be aired at 7.30 am Wednesday on the Discovery Communications-owned Science Channel in the US. 
The show puts the spotlight once again on the Ram Setu by quoting American archaeologists who say the 50-km stretch  between Pamban Island near Rameshwaram in India and Mannar Island off Sri Lanka  is man-made. The Ram Setu is also called Adams bridge. The promo has got more than 1.1 million views since it was shared by Science Channel on social media 16 hours ago. 
Satellite imagery show formations that scientists believe are limestone shoals. Creating a 83-km-long deep water channel under the Sethusamudram canal project would require extensive dredging and removal of the limestone shoals.

Namals money laundering case: AG told to provide witnesses statements
	
In the case where MP Namal Rajapaksa faces money laundering charges, Colombo High Court Judge Sampath Abeykoon, taking into consideration the Right to Fair Trial, directed the Attorney General to provide the defense with the statements made by witnesses not cited in the indictment.
The Judge made theorder in relation to the money laundering case filed against Namal Rajapaksa, Indika Prabath Karunajeewa, Nithya Senani, Sujani Bogollagama, Iresha Silva and Gowers Cooperates Services over a transition of Rs. 30 million of which the origin is alleged to be illegal.
The Attorney General had cited the list of witnesses who will be testified during the trial at the onset of the filing of the case inthe High Court.
However, appearing on behalf of the second suspect, Senior Counsel Sampath Mendis told court that the AG had deliberately disregarded some witnesses statements which had been recorded by police at the preliminary inquiry.
He said there are individuals, whose statements could be beneficial for the accused party.
However, State Counsel appearing on behalf of the Attorney General said that the prosecution has already provided the list of the witnesses who are said to be called in the trial.
He said that the other witnesses who gave statements to police are not relevant to the trial as there are limitations to the concept of fair trial and prevailing law should be considered before permitting such opportunity to the defence as there is no provision in law to provide such statements.
He said that there is a comprehensive and complicated inquiry going on and therefore providing other witnesses statements to the defence is not practical.
However, citing several precedents, Judge Abeykoonsaid that the fundamental elements of fair trial should be considered even at this situation as the court is on the quest of finding nothing else but the truth.
Meanwhile, Namal Rajapaksa was permitted to travel to Dubai between December 20 and 31 to participate in a function as the Chief Guest.
The case wouldbe called tomorrow to decide on further trial dates. Two trial dates which are on February 16 and 20 had already been set. (Shehan Chamika Silva)

Plan to discipline misbehaving members
	

A move designed to discourage the unbecoming behaviour on the part of some members of the august assembly is said to be now underway.

The unruly conduct of some members marked by an audacious display of a callous disregard for elementary ethics and standing orders had drawn public criticisms in the recent past. In fact, some of them had made a practice of booing while covering the face with a file or a hand to prevent the detection of the source of noise.
The strategy that the authorities have already worked out is such that the members who misbehave or boo and make catcalls will learn an unforgettable lesson, an informed source said.
A leading Buddhist prelate who called on a powerful Green purohita hailing from the South invited him to attend a Pinkama at his temple as the chief guest.
The purohita readily accepted this invitation.
The prelate during the cordial conversation that ensued also told the purohita that he had also invited the head of the department responsible for maintaining law and order to attend the ceremony in the capacity of a distinguished guest. He is a religious-minded person who has realized the spiritual and practical value of meditation. So I thought he is an ideal person to attend our Pinkama as a guest honour! the prelate explained.
O! It is quite alright! said the purohita.

Amid complaints about public events after the declarations of the local government elections, the Elections Commission (EC) said notices would be issued restricting the participation of politicians at such events and confining them only to government servants.
The EC has received several complaints about such events involving ruling party politicians, the allocation of money for road development and the abuse of government properties such as rest houses for political work during the election period.
It said these activities were not permitted during election time because they give political mileage to a party or an independent group in the fray.
The EC is currently accepting nominations from the respective political parties and independent groups for the election to be conducted in February.

'Ram Setu' man-made, claims US TV channel
	
The spotlight is back on the mythological 'Ram Setu' between India and Sri Lanka, after a show on the Science Channel in the US hinted that such a structure may actually exist outside of mythology.
A promo released by the channel suggests that the bridge - also called Adam's Bridge - may not be a natural formation and may have been built by humans.
"Are the ancient Hindu myths of a land bridge connecting India and Sri Lanka true Scientific analysis suggests they are," says text accompanying the promo.
Citing images from a Nasa satellite, the show claims that investigators have found a line of rocks 30 miles long between Sri Lanka and India.
The stones in the image are sitting on a 'sandbar', which occurs in areas with shallow water. As geologist Erin Argyilan explains, sand could accumulate between the land masses.
An analysis of the rocks found on the sea bed shows that they predate the sand, Rose adds.
Specifically, the 7,000-year-old rocks are sitting on sand that is 4,000-years-old.
In fact, geologist Dr Alan Lester believes that the stones were brought from afar and set atop the sandbar island chain. (Times of India)

Practically everyone in the country heaved a long sigh of relief when the guns on the pestering SAITM issue that grew into proportions of a national crisis fell silent. However, a proposal setting out the minimum qualifications required for admission to the private medical colleges presented for approval to the top team in yahapalanaya the other day could lead to re-igniting the issue, they say.

It had transpired at this top team meeting that the proposal presented to the top team did not embody the admission criteria for medical education at private universities that had been formulated by a team of competent medical specialists appointed by the authorities themselves and what it carried was a spurious one worked out by a `political hand lowering the minimum qualifications required.
The doctors union leaders who had got the wind of the attempt to get a substitute admission criteria approved by the highest decision-making body are about to take to the war path again, they say.
The union had reportedly even found out the author of the substitute entry criteria and the politico behind the move.
So all indications are that there will be fireworks on highways again on the eve of the upcoming polls.

SL should show it's not afraid of open economy: PM
	
Sri Lanka should show the world that it is not a country which is afraid of the open economy and take steps to modernize the city of Colombo and elsewhere while preserving its heritage, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said today.
Prime Minister made this remark at a seminar Living Heritage organized by the European Union together with the British Council last morning.
The civilization of Sri Lanka was a powerful commercial one. The modern commercialization came to Asia from Sri Lanka.. We were one of the important countries in Asia during the old days. Preserving buildings of Rajarata Kingdom and during the European colonial period is not enough. Our effort today should be to become the hub of the Indian Ocean. A new architecture and new buildings would be introduced to the country under this programme. If we introduced an economy based on trade in Rajarata during the old days we must not be afraid to do it today and introduce a modern architecture to the country which is essential for it. Let us try to create a perception that Sri Lanka is not a nation that is afraid of open economy, the Prime Minister said .
I find it ironic, that the government of Netherlands is spending money to preserve the buildings which were put up by destroying the Dutch buildings. Colombo together with Goa happens to be the oldest cities which were opened out to the Europeans. In this area is the Fort of Colombo put up by the Portuguese. There is also the residence of the Dutch governor. There are other Dutch buildings here. Subsequently after the British took over some buildings came down. They said the house of the Dutch Governor had to be brought down. However, one part of it is left. That is the mission to the seamen that is next to this Hotel GOH. There were other buildings such as Cargills and all those buildings were brought down by the British and their buildings were put in place. I am not complaining about it as in the process my great grandfather made money by giving the bricks, Don Carolis made money by giving furniture and Artigala by giving the plants. Artigala through the money he earned found Kahatagaha Graphite, he also said.
Colombo has a lot of old architecture, the warehouse building from Fort is from the Dutch period, Wolfendhal Church in the early British period, Srimathipaya, the Prime Ministers office, Prime Ministers residence which comes from Dutch period to early British period. Actually the transformation of out architecture taking in the national design where you find Edward Reed did the Kelaniya Temple in the format of Lankatilaka Vihara, subsequently which Abaknodi Will Jones has done with the Lake House building with the Independence Squire and the Peradeniya building and the National Art Gallery which was destroyed. Wherever you go you find old buildings of Europen heritage in the country. We have a history of architecture going down to the era of Thuparamaya. We have already seen some of them getting converted. How do we preserve them and build them up We put a group of our officials to come up with a final report on the situation with regard to old buildings. Help us to identify and see how they should be preserved. There are many more old buildings that have to be preserved. Are there any groups to undertake it. There are students from University of Moratuwa, if they are willing to do it we will fund it, he added.
Ambassador of European Union and in Sri Lanka and Maldives Tung-Lai Margue said the challenge of balancing conservation and development and marrying each other is faced not only in Sri Lanka but everywhere in the world. This is a challenge we have accepted. I hope Sri Lanka will not face the hardships which countries such as Singapore has faced in conserving old buildings and undertaking development , he said.

Thai dog becomes worlds first to get athlete-style prosthetic legs
	
DPA, 12th DECEMBER, 2017
A Thai dog has become the first dog in the world to be given hi-tech prosthetic legs with blades made from same materials used by Paralympic runners, an animal welfare charity told dpa on Tuesday.
Cola, a two-year-old mixed-breed Thai dog, was fitted with the prosthetics on December 1 and started running just five minutes later, the Phuket-based Soi Dog Foundation said.
We are so happy to see Cola running with his new legs. It is great to see him play and run like the other dogs, said the foundations founder
John Dalley. Cola lost his front legs when he was six months old after an enraged Bangkok resident slashed his legs with a sword for chewing his shoes,
Dalley said.
Feeling an immediate affinity with Cola, Dalleys wife Gill, who lost both of her legs after contracting septicaemia 10 years ago, took the puppy in and moved him 840 kilometres south
of the capital to Phuket.
The decision to give Cola the legs came after Gill Dalley, who got her prosthetic legs from an orthopedic laboratory in the southern resort city, decided to ask the lab to also make a pair for her dog.

A Blue purohita speaking on the annual budget the other day minced no words when he expressed his vehement opposition to a certain budget proposal.

Raising his voice, the purohita declared that there were many others who shared his view and he would not allow the implementation of this proposal.
It was a young Green member from the gem-rich district who immediately reacted to the Blue purohitas statement. You should have taken up this issue at the meeting of the top decision-making body. You kept your mouth shut there and now you are making a big noise here to become a big hero This reply drew tumultuous approval from many government backbenchers.
The sittings were suspended soon afterwards for the lunch break and most members headed for the council canteen and the purohita and the young member from the gem-rich district were among them.
And at the canteen there was a face-face encounter between the two antagonists. And as their colleagues who feared a possible scuffle between them were looking on wide eyed and with bated breath, the Blue purohita walked up to his detractor and addressed the latter in a cordial tone: Malli, why do you attack me like this openly in the House You know that we two can settle any matter by talking to each other privately If you have any problem, see me at the Ministry Now let us have our lunch.
The duo was later seen taking their lunch at the same table, they say.

Trump will visit the UK next year despite row over far-right retweets: US Ambassador
	

Donald Trump will come to Britain next year despite anger over his far-right retweets, the US ambassador to Londonsaid today.
Woody Johnson admitted that the public spat with Theresa May meant some feathers were ruffled.
But he said the leaders still had a very very good relationship and he believed the visit would still happen.
The row erupted last month when the US President retweeted three anti-Muslim videos posted by the Britain First group.
One claimed to show a Muslim migrant beating up a Dutch boy on crutches. Dutch authorities have insisted the alleged migrant was born and raised in the country and his religion is unknown.
The PM insisted retweeting Britain First was the wrong thing to do, and said she would not hesitate to tell Mr Trump when she disagreed with him.
But in the worst public clashes between US and UK leaders in memory, Mr Trump doubled down by demanding that Mrs May focus on tackling Islamic Terrorism in Britain rather than criticising him.
Downing Street has said Mrs May wants to speak to the US president by telephone, but weeks later the call has still not taken place. 
It is conceived as a pared-back trip, rather than a red carpet occasion.
Ministers have admitted they are deeply uncomfortable about the prospect of him coming to the UK.
Asked about the visit, US ambassador Mr Johnson told BBC Radio 4s Today programme: Absolutely, I think he will come...

JO MP Rohitha Abeygunawardana said yesterday the two MPs who defected from the joint opposition (JO) who had no value were being described as heroes.
He said if anyone wanted to leave the JO based on principles, they should have done so three years ago.
The cross over of an MP no longer creates a trend. It wont affect the peoples opinion anymore. It is only a change in the head count and not the voter base. There are several MPs to come and join us too, he said.
He said they have loosened the roots of the yahapalanaya tree and that it was only a matter of time till it collapsed.
Meanwhile, MP Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena said the two MPs leaving the JO wont make a big impact and assured their principles wont change.
He said there was a huge response from applicants seeking nominations to contest the election from the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna and therefore, it was difficult to give everyone an opportunity.
However, the reason to leave the JO should not be termed as issues related with nominations, he said.(Lahiru Pothmulla)

UN officials visited LTTE detainees-- Did not visit two naval officers in prison
	
The United Nations (UN) did not visit the Naval Officers, Cmdr Dasanayaka and Lt. Cmdr Sumith Ranasinghe who are in prison but it was reported that they had visited the LTTE detainees at the same location, rear admiral (Rtd) Sarath Weerasekara said.
It seems they are interested in LTTE suspects. The CID has confirmed that there was no evidence taking ransom. These two naval officers are detained until the investigations are over; the investigations have been going on for the past eight years. It means they have to be in prison indefinitely. Grant them bail and file cases if there is sufficient evidence as they have sacrificed their entire life to save the country from terrorists, he said.
Meanwhile, he said politicians who crossover from one party to another do so mainly for financial gain and because they lack principles.
Those who cross over from one political party to another without any valid reason do not possess an iota of shame and act in this manner when persuaded by large sums of money. Therefore, the people should make proper use of the upcoming local government elections to prevent such crooks from entering politics, he said.
Meanwhile, Ven. Medagoda Abayatissa Thera referring to the leasing of the Hambantota Port to a Chinese firm, said the government should be ashamed of selling the country's resources without any sustainable profit to the country.(Sheain Fernandopulle)

Visa announces suite of sensory branding
	
Visa recently announced a suite of sensory branding that will support the Visa brand in an expanded universe of connected, payment-enabled devices.
These new sound, animation and haptic (vibration) cues will help signify completed transactions in digital and physical retail environments when you pay with Visa. The sound of Visa will debut in Visas global advertising campaign ahead of the Olympic Winter Games Pyeong Chang 2018.
For 60 years, the Visa brand has been a global symbol of innovation, speed, trust and security, said Visa Chief Marketing and Communications Officer Lynne Biggar.
As payments become increasingly embedded in commerce, the notion of Everywhere You Want To Be takes on even greater meaning for our brand. As new payment experiences continue to take shape in the world, this suite of sensory branding elements will give consumers the assurances we know they want every time they use Visa.
Research shows that the Visa brand universally signifies trust, security and an understanding of available payment options. In a recent consumer study commissioned by Visa, up to 71 percent of respondents surveyed thought a website was secure when the Visa logo was visible, yielding a higher likelihood to complete a transaction.
In a digital world filled with connected wearable devices, Visas sensory branding elements are designed to evoke those same emotions, even in environments where the traditional Visa logo is not visible.
Value of sensory branding
Extensive consumer research was conducted in eight countries to identify the impact of sensory branding on perceptions of both Visa and its ecosystem of partners, finding that:
83 percent said the sound or animation cues positively impacted their perception of the Visa brand.
81 percent said they would have a more positive perception of merchants who used either the sound or animation cues.
Less than a second in length, the sound of Visa was found to signal speed and convenience.
The effectiveness of haptic technology in advertising has been shown to incite feelings of happiness and excitement during exposure among consumers.
Visas sensory branding will be available as a software development kit (SDK) on the Visa Developer Platform and through the Visa Ready programme for deeper integration requirements, in 2018. Visa is also developing pilot programmes with a national merchant and point-of-sale (POS) hardware vendors for 2018.

Wont sacrifice regional ties for economic gains: SL
	
Sri Lanka will not sacrifice its regional interests for economic gains though the country needs economic support from all nations to move forward, Provincial Councils and Local Government Minister Faiszer Musthapha said.
In an interview with the New Indian Express, the Minister has said that India will always remain Sri Lankas closest neighbour and friend.
You must understand the economic dynamics and we need economic support from all nations to move forward. However, Sri Lanka will not sacrifice regional interests for economic gains, he said reminding Sri Lankas bond with India has withstood the test of time.
The Minister, who was is Thiruvananthapuram, observed that the steady increase in the number of tourists from India to Sri Lanka is the biggest indicator of the special relationship between the two.
Colombo is like a weekend home or home away from home for many Indians. For those in the South it is less than an hour away, he said.
The minister was on a three-day tour of Kerala to learn the role of women in local administration. Sri Lanka is in the process of ensuring 25 percent participation of women in local governance.
Minister Musthapha said his country has a lot to learn from India, since in spite of so many ethnicities, languages and religions, the nation still identifies itself as India.
