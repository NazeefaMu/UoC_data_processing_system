A party bigwig to be pitted against Big Vig
	

The leadership of the main alliance of the North has got their hands full with the task of holding together in one piece the shaky alliance that has now begun cracking up, they say.

According to the latest reports, the alliance has decided to give party nomination to Senadhi to contest the upcoming provincial polls, sidelining Big Vig who has been looking down his nose at the party leadership ever since being elected the Northern Chief.
In the event of Big Vig being denied nomination, chances are that he will contest on the ticket of the new party he has founded in which case the contest in the North will be one mainly between Big Vig and Senadhi, they say.

Angry over the pot calling the kettle black
	

A group of Diyawanna Greens who are highly worried and disconcerted over the appellation rogues being freely used in referring to their party leaders these days have decided to hit back at the detractors, they say.

For starters, this Green group led by some young purohitas, have decided to take on several sleazy Betel leaf purohitas.
The group has already unearthed a number of shady deals and other fiddles these purohitas are said to involved in and are about to go public with the stuff with a big bang.
The Green buck from Uva gave a hint of what they have planned to come out with in an emotive speech recently.
So the day is not far off when they are to come out with all guns firing, they say.

Bangladesh Finance State Minister visits HNB
	
With Sri Lanka and Bangladesh witnessing deepening bilateral economic cooperation in recent years, particularly in key power and other large-scale projects, Hatton National Bank (HNB) Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer Jonathan Alles said the bank is looking forward to strengthening its support and furthering strategic partnerships with those who wish to increase their scope of business in Bangladesh.
He said this on the occasion of the visit of Bangladesh Finance State Minister Mohammed Abdul Mannan to HNB, recently. Sri Lankas largest private sector bank, HNB, hosted a roundtable discussion for its clients, currently in business and having a presence in Bangladesh, to meet with Mannan together with High Commissioner for Bangladesh in Sri Lanka Riaz Hamidullah, for a mutual dialogue.
Alles said it was a privilege and honour for the bank to have the minister visit them and it was an opportunity for their valued customers who have invested and are operating businesses in Bangladesh to have a fruitful discussion.
Mannan highlighted the fact that currently there are 50,000 Sri Lankan professionals working in Bangladesh and holding high level positions, providing ample opportunities for banking services.
Bangladeshs friendly investment regime offers tremendous opportunities for investments particularly in the areas of healthcare, ICT, hospitality and agri-business, explained Mannan, while adding that several power generation projects plus hospitals started by Sri Lankans are operationally very successful.
Mannan urged those present to capitalize on his countrys offering of a large stretch of pristine coastal land, suitable for tourism and hospitality plus the free trade agreement (FTA) between Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. Clearance by US Federal Drug Authority (FDA) on pharmaceutical products manufactured in Bangladesh is another opportunity for investors to make full use of, he stated.
Hamidullah shared a number of emerging perspectives that should merit attention of Sri Lankan business and industry. He also underlined some ways in which industries of the two countries could collaborate beyond the existing patterns, modes and sectors, like in apparel and ICT. He recommended Sri Lankan businessmen to reach out to the Bangladeshi business and industry much more, on possible win-win basis.
HNB, adjudged the best retail bank for the past nine years, is happy to look for opportunities in Bangladesh, Alles alluded, while opening the floor for discussions.

CB Bond Scam -- I took action no sooner it surfaced in 2015: PM
	
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe informed Parliament today that he had taken action on the Central Bank bond issue soon after it surfaced in March 2015.
He said he appointed a three-member committee headed by lawyer Gamini Pitipana to look into this matter, and it recommended further action and pointed out that he tabled a copy of that report to Parliament on May 19, 2015.
Later, the COPE headed by JVP MP Sunil Handunnetti inquired into this matter further and submitted its report. I referred both this reports and the Auditor Generals report to the Attorney General. I also sought legal advice to determine whether there has been fraud, a deviation of the proper procedure and whether Central Bank Governor Arjun Mahendran was responsible for what happened. I informed the Secretary General of Parliament to send all the documents, required by the Attorney General, with the Speakers permission, the Prime Minister said.
He said he also wrote to the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) asking for details about any internationally accepted mechanism on the procedure of bond issues and determination of losses in case of a fraud.
They ruled out the existence of such a mechanism and they notified me that the loss would depend on the market conditions at the time of the concerned bond issue, the Premier said said.
Confirming that the government has been taking steps since 2015 with regard to the bond issue, he said even stock market trading by Perpetual Treasuries Limited had been suspended .
The suspension has been extended for six more months. The Central Bank has frozen Rs.12 billion belonging to this company. According the Presidential Commissions report, the loss had been estimated at Rs.12 billion. What is now left is the institution of legal action to recover the financial loss caused to the government, the Premier said and added that it was the first time that such an impartial investigation had been conducted in an effective manner.
The Premier said the Commission had recommended a probe into irregularities in bond transactions between 2008 and 2014 as well.
I have already instructed the relevant authorities to initiate action in this regard. We will punish all those responsible, he said and added that during this period the bond transactions worth Rs.5,147 billion had taken place. He said transactions of Rs.4,702 billion had taken place through private direct placements.
It means more than 90 per cent of transactions had taken place in that manner. No approval had been obtained from the Monetary Board for these transactions, the Premier said. (Kelum Bandara and Yohan Perera)

Clash of MPs in Parliament
	
Parliament was engulfed in turmoil today with the members of the United National Party (UNP) and the joint opposition trading blows and exchanging unsavoury words over differences with regard to the tabling of the Presidential Commission of Inquiry (PCoI) report on the Central Bank bond.
Parliament met yesterday for a special session to discuss the CB bond transactions. At the start of business, Speaker Karu Jayasuriya announced that President Maithripala Sirisena had agreed to make available copies to the House in a week.
However, the three main political groups in the Opposition -- the Tamil National Alliance (TNA), the joint opposition and the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) were not agreeable to this.
JVP leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake, who is also the Chief Opposition Whip, said the Employees Provident Fund (EPF) which hold the savings of the workers had lost as much as Rs.8.5 billion in the larges ever financial fraud committed in this country and therefore the report should be submitted to the House without any further delay.
We have also sought a report under the Right to Information Act. It means we should be given a copy by January 15. Today is January 10. One cannot say the Presidents Office is not ready now. Therefore, there is no reason for the presidential secretariat to delay giving the copies. If the President has referred the report to the Bribery Commission and the Attorney Generals Department, then why cant it be given to the House The House is above them all, he said.
His position was widely accepted by joint oppositions parliamentary group leader Dinesh Gunawardane. He said the Speaker assured them the other day that a copy would be made available to the House yesterday. He asked the Speaker to order the Presidential Secretariat to release the report to the House immediately.
We even agreed at the party leaders meeting that the English version would suffice for the time being. Parliament is supreme. That is the position upheld by all the past Speakers. Once former Speaker Anura Bandaranaike upheld that even the Supreme Court could not overrule Parliament. Former Speaker Chamal Rajapaksa upheld that view. We have heard that a report is available with the Attorney General. He is an official answerable to the House. We can engage him now, Mr. Gunawardene said.
TNA and Opposition Leader R. Sampanthan said the debate should take place at the earliest.
There is no dispute over that. This is a report the country is interested in seeing. We must debate it and get to the root of it, he said.
TNA MP M.A. Sumanthiran also endorsed what the JVP leader said and said a report should be available by 1.30 p.m.
The Speaker responded saying the presidents office had agreed to send it within a week and asked the members not to create a rift between him and the President. At this point Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe stood up to make a statement.
Mr. Gunawardane raised objections saying the Prime Minister should not be allowed to make a statement in the absence of an overall debate. However, the Speaker allowed the Prime Minister to go ahead with his statement. At this moment, the members of the JO started demonstrating displaying posters and condemning the bond scam. They walked into the Well of the House and moved towards the Speaker. Just then Polonnaruwa district UNP MP Sydney Jayaratne and some others like Hector Appuhamy confronted the protesting MPs and snatching their posters. It led to a tense situation, leading at times to the members on both sides of the House exchanging fisticuffs. UNP MP S.M. Marikkar had nearly exchanged fisticuffs with JO MP Gamini Lokuge. Amid the din the Prime Minister made his statement and subsequently, the House was adjourned.
Meanwhile, there was further tension after Mr. Marikkar who arrived in the Chamber after the House was adjourned and slapped Mr. Lokuge who was standing in the aisle. UNP MP Chaminda Wijesiri also began to hit Mr. Lokuge provoking the other JO members to thrash Mr. Wijesiri.
Fisticuffs were seen being exchanged by MPs Appuhami, Johnston Fernando and Prasanna Ranaweera whose shirt was apparently torn in the melee. (Kelum Bandara and Yohan Perera)

Coexisting with  spotted  cats  in the jungle
	

With a tawny or rusty yellow coat, dark spots and close-set rosettes, the Panthera pardus kotiya or the Sri Lankan leopard in other words continues to dominate the food chain in different habitats of the island. Although theres a recorded number of over 700 leopards currently living in Sri Lanka, the animal is usually a seldom seen species on nature trails, unless you are lucky to spot those spots! Recent footage of a leopard pouncing on village folk in Hatton went viral on electronic and social media which was interpreted in different ways. When comparing Sri Lanka with India, we have five incidents per year when compared to 800 incidents per year in India, says Anjali Watson, founding trustee and primary researcher of The Wilderness and Wildlife Conservation Trust (WWCT). Along with her husband Dr. Andrew Kittle (zoologist and ecologist), the duo has conducted ecological research on the leopard in multiple locations across the country.

The caught up with these two enthusiastic researchers who shed light onthe broader concerns of conservationand coexistence of humans andleopards inSri Lanka.

Panthera pardus kotiya
Its considered a big cat in the cat family, said Dr. Kittle, explaining its appearance. Leopards are mostly solitary beings, but they do get together for mating purposes and also in the case of mothers and cubs. They also communicate among themselves a lot, so they know whats happening on the landscape even though we call them solitary. They are extremely adaptable which means that they can live in different habitats from almost deserted areas in the world to dense rainforests and even higher up in mountainous areas. Another reason for this change is that they are adaptable in their diet as well. Therefore they can eat prey that is larger and also smaller in size. According to our research, it shows that their diet vary across different habitats. Adaptability also allows them to live in close proximity to humans, without people knowing about their whereabouts. They are found within major city limits including Nairobi, Johannesburg, and Mumbai and in Sri Lanka they are found within Kandy city limits and so on, added Dr. Kittle.

Distribution inSri Lanka
According to research conducted by WWCT, the distribution of the leopard across the country is about 37% of its range. Historically it used to be spread throughout the island, but its no longer found in the South Western areas; its also not found in the vast agricultural lands towards Anuradhapura. It still exists over about 50% of the island, but it actually lives within about 20% and that area is strongly linked with forest cover. This includes protected areas as well which are linked to forest cover because the leopard is reliant on prey. Therefore the forest cover is very important. This is similar in the dry zone, the Central hills and the wet zone as well. More limited populations are found in the lowland wet zones including Sinharaja forest. Therefore it definitely has decreased over the past few years, said a concerned Dr. Kittle. 

Therefore the forest cover is very important. This is similar in the dry zone, the Central hills and the wet zone as well. More limited populations are found in the lowland wet zones including Sinharaja forest

We have done density analysis in Yala, Wilpattu, Horton Plains and in the peak areas and the highest density of leopards is in Yala, Anjali added. Horton Plains come next. Theres high density in the plains because of the sambar deer. If we were to expand that study to mountainous areas it would be lesser. The leopard density depends on the amount of prey available. The more prey available, the higher the leopard count in a given area. The leopard populations are quite reasonable in all these places. We get half the density in the peaks which arent protected and have tea landscapes. These are not the fringes of Peak Wilderness Sanctuary and the tea estates and Bogawantalawa Valley base. We still havent gone into Peak Wilderness itself. But we have taken chunks of it on the edges of the Bogawantalawa Valley. Currently we are working in Gal Oya. We have done our research in Ritigala, Wilpattu and in the Central Highlands in the Dunumadallawa Forest Reserve, Agarapathana and in many other different places. One interesting finding the WWCT has found is that in this part of the Central Hills in the Bogawantalawa Valley female leopards reside and reproduce in the ridge that separates the Maskeliya and Castlereigh Reservoirs. Its a section of forests thats there and theres Peak Wilderness at the bottom. Therefore males move through tea estates to move in to their habitats. As a result we want that ridge protected as an additional conservation, the duo said.

Endangered species
The animal was made endangered and was included in the IUCN Red List with the assessments carried out by WWCT. The Trust has kept it as endangered due to certain categories. These include : 
The leopard population being an island population
	The smaller population size 
	Habitat depletion 
Referring to the distribution of adult male and female leopards, Dr. Kittle confirmed that each study site differs and roughly for one adult there are three to four adult females. Females have a range which is quite small. Its only as big as it needs to be. Males and females are born at the same rate, but one might wonder what happens to all the males. When a male is about one and a half to two years old, they have to leave the mother. Hence, they have to go and look for other territory to establish themselves. But of course those territories have resident male leopards and they are not going to be welcoming. Therefore the young male is in danger and the mortality rate within that age is high. Animals are killed in conflict or they are more likely to go to dangerous areas where humans live in. Sometimes we find that leopards that are involved in killings are quite young, he stressed.

Key findings
Speaking about some key findings in their research, the duo stressed on Temporal Niche Partitioning. During day time they are inactive, but figures show that they frequent in areas where people are active in the day. This shows that they do it to coexist on the same landscape. Scat Analysis is another aspect that we are considering. In Kandy for example we found that they had a lot of porcupine in their diet. Its a small area. It could be one or two females who would be specializing in it. In Yala we found that they are avoiding wild boar and going for sambar. In Wilpattu theres a high focus on primates. We dont only do the diet size, but we also look at prey density to find out what is available for the leopards. They are avoiding wild boar because they dont want to be injured, they said.
Anjali further said that the prey are very important to find out about the density of leopards. Theres something called the Empty Forest Syndrome which is where you have a forest, but theres nothing in it. This is mainly evident in China where there are forests which are dead quiet because everything has been hunted down. Not only do you need a forest, but you need a healthy forest. The fact that there are different diets in different habitats is interesting, they added.

Preying on roaming dogs
Referring to the recent video footage of the leopard encounter in Hatton, Anjali says it looked like an incident from India. Because of what they did five others received injuries. Everybody has to deal with it. Up in that area leopards are going wherever they can to avoid these situations. Theyre using the landscape in a way that they could reduce these incidents. We have solid data from Scat Analysis which reveals that a very small percentage of domestic animals are being consumed. Its happening on a small scale. Its not that they are only eating dogs. Habitat loss could probably be an indicator that the leopards dont have enough prey. So they might prey on free roaming dogs. If people dont want their dogs to fall prey to these leopards, they should be kept indoors. The way people reacted during that encounter is not welcoming. They in fact asked for all those injuries, said Anjali. 


Adaptability also allows them to live in close proximity to humans, without people knowing about their whereabouts. They are found within major city limits including Nairobi, Johannesburg, and Mumbai and in Sri Lanka they are found within Kandy city limits and so on

Dos and Donts in a leopard encounter
Back away and allow the animal to get away. 
	Before you have the encounter, try to avoid it bymaking noise. 
	Be close together, but dont rush into the place
	Fire crackers and fire barrels will keep the animal away.
	Clear the space around your house if youre living in close proximity to a forest

Methods in which leopards are killed

Snares
	Poisoning
	Electrocution
	Retaliatory killing (in places where there are cattle)

Animal will be released to a vacant territory :Sooriyabandara
Speaking to the Dailymirror, Department of Wildlife Conservation Director General M.G.C Sooriyabandara said that the trap has already been laid. Once the animal is trapped we will release it to a vacant territory. In moving forward we have to educate the people about how to react in such an encounter. Since they are territorial animals its difficult to control such sudden incidents. But we are trying to reduce encounters as much as possible.  


Conservation status
In their concluding remarks, Dr. Andrew and Anjali said that post-war the country is experiencing a rapid phase of development. Sri Lanka has a big physical plan which is coming up in the future.
Theres Wildlife and a Forest department and all these avenues need to be looked at in one landscape. As far as conservation goes, all our research has to be plugged in to this plan. You cannot have economic development if your ecological development is going down. We need to protect the ridge which we mentioned earlier and that has already been proposed. Likewise, by protecting areas in which we find leopard activity, we will be able to have a positive growth in the distribution in future.

The sporty one went into a fluster on hearing that his tryst with the soothsayer had leaked out to the public domain and hastened to deny the story. I am not so superstitious as to go after occultists to know about the future of the game, he declared in righteous anger.
However, the female soothsayer did not take to this denial kindly.
She sent a brief message to the sporty one saying that she might be reluctantly compelled to make public the SMS and the video footage relating to his visit in defense of her honour and reputation.
At that the sporty one went into the silent mode, they say.

Dropping drugs and picking up skills in lost arts
	
When this scribe went to meet the SLANA Director Dharshini Guniyangoda she posed an intriguing question for a starter. Are you into any kind of drug, she asked me, startling me in the process. When I answered in the negative she inquired as to why not My response was, Because I have better things to focus on and do in my life. I dont want to waste my time on something that doesnt give any kind of positive outcome. 
This is how my conversation with Guniyangoda, Director of Sri Lanka Anti Narcotics Association (SLANA), a non-government and non-profit membership organization that campaigns against the drug menace, began. Guniyangoda explained that a person starts using drugs and becomes addicted to it because he/she feels hopeless and has no vision in life. We are providing them with hope and making them have dreams. Through our programmes we are trying to show them that there are much better things to do in life in order to achieve what they are passionate about, she said.
We are providing them with hope and making them have dreams. Through our programmes we are trying to show them that there are much better things to do in life in order to achieve what they are passionate about
SLANA is involved in the prevention of drugs and develops skills to make lives of people, especially the youth, productive. Among dozens of anti-narcotics organizations operating in the country, SLANA is recognized for its difference. This is due to its approach, effective programmes and the manner in which it sets about building character in youth, who are vulnerable to drug abuse.
The primary objectives of SLANA are based on prevention of risky behaviour, which has the potential to provide the initiative for substance abuse. SLANA states that it recognizes a strong nexus between low income levels and substance abuse. Therefore, the promotion of skills- which empower the young, economically marginalized and disadvantaged individuals towards income generation and self-employment-will serve as a strong protective factor. Such efforts leave a success trail when support comes from various segments, both Government and non-government, and contributions are made to empower the process of risk reduction.
Measures taken not adequate
Guniyangoda said that data reveals that the age group most vulnerable to drugs fall between ages 16-25. She said that it is considered that this is the age group during which individuals are most productive. She was of the view that the drug problem, that requires national priority, has worsened by the day as measures taken by numerous organizations at national level are not adequate to address the problem.
Considerable arrests of drug users and sellers were reported in every district in Sri Lanka. There is evidence of drug abuse being prevalent in Sri Lanka. Data maintained by the National Dangerous Drugs Control Board (NDDCB) reveals that the total number of drug related arrests was 79,378 in 2016. Compared with 2015, drug related arrests had decreased by 4% in 2016. Most of the drug related arrests have been reported from the Western Province (60%), followed by the Southern Province (9%) and the Central Province (10%). Out of the total drug related arrests, 43% were from Colombo District, 13% from Gampaha district and 4% from Kurunegala District. 
During the first quarter of 2017, in addition to Heroin and Cannabis, the highest number of drug users was reported from the age groups 25-29 and 30-34 for tobacco and alcohol. The figures maintained by the NDDCB indicate that there is a trend towards the use of dangerous drugs among the youth belonging to the age group 25-34. This is a high risk group and demands attention. The highest usage (202) was recorded with Cannabis users. They were school dropouts and had received an education somewhere between the grades 5-10. In addition there were 214 Heroin users, also school dropouts who had received a similar education. These stats reveal a co-relationship between drug use and a lower education level. 
Teaching and training
SLANA, with the aid of the Australian High Commission, started a project named Empowering for income generation through trails of lost arts which aims to create an income generating mindset among youth and unemployed individuals by teaching and training lost arts in wood carving.
The wood craft project was started in October 2016 in the Western, Sabaragamuwa and Southern Provinces. Reinforcing an indigenous lost art of Sri Lanka-Wooden Arts and Crafts, introducing small scale entrepreneurship and income earning avenues, spreading new ways and means of Wooden Arts and Crafts through an innovative training session and casting a new business model in the contemporary market industry are major components of the project.
It is sad but true that there are many young people who are not proud to call themselves Sri Lankans. We have a very rich heritage. Many people have forgotten that. There are arts and crafts that are very unique to Sri Lanka. Young people are not introduced to these things. Through this project, we are trying to show them what these unique industries are and encourage them to be part of them. I personally dont think that our country can compete with other nations because there is a technological aspects involved. We can create and establish our countrys identity by prioritizing industries that are unique to Sri Lanka, which will ultimately create a good market in the world, she remarked.
We have successfully completed all stages of the project in all three provinces.
We have successfully completed all stages of the project in all three provinces. At Maggona, it was in collaboration with St. Vincents Technical School, managed and supervised by Fr. Sameera. Our partners in Deniyaya and Yatinyanthota are SEDEC organization and Shilpa Handa organization respectively, Guniyangoda concluded.

A high-up of a government security wing responsible for maintaining law and order visited the most sacred Buddhist shrine in the country for worship at the dawn of the New Year.

Being conscious of his high status, the high-up wanted to enter the inner sanctum through the portal reserved for the high and mighty in the ruling hierarchy. The high-up stood at the portal waiting for someone to come running to open it. He waited in vain while seconds ticked into minutes and minutes into an hour.
And at long last, an official who turned up opened the portal for the high up to enter, but not before giving him a lecture on the tradition relating to the opening of this entrance for worshippers.

He lost his way inside the large mansion
	

There is a certain purohita in yahapalanaya who held similar high status in several previous regimes as well.

By the way, this purohita is the owner of several mansions both in the hills and in the city suburbs.
The house-warming of a mansion he put up in the upcountry for his son took place recently. A Pirith Pinkama followed by a Sanghika Dana to Maha Sangha to mark the event too was held.
One of the monks who had attended the all-night Pirith pinkama had wanted to answer a call of nature. And one of the family members had shown him the way leading to the nearest toilet. On his way back to the location of the ceremony, the monk had found himself at a loss what direction he should take given the labyrinth of corridors on the spacious floor. Finally, he had made it back to the place of the ceremony directed by a person whom he had hailed.
Later, when told about the incident, the purohita had looked more exultant about the largeness of his mansion than apologetic about the difficulty the monk had to undergo, they say.

He was greeted with a deafening silence
	

The inaugural convention of the Pohottuwa alliance was held in the city with much fanfare.

The most important item of the days agenda was to introduce the leaders of the alliance to the country at large.
The audience greeted with a loud ovation the introduction of every leader of the alliance which as usual was preceded by a glowing commentary at its oratorical best. The introduction of Panchaudha and New Heritage leaders was greeted with a rousing ovation. The former strongman leading Pohottuwa was greeted with a thunderous applause. However, the audience had remained silent as that after a storm when the name of a very senior leader of the JO was announced, they say. Those who attended the meeting say that this unusual silence observed by the audience was the most conspicuous feature of the occasion.
The JO leader looked stunned by the cold reception he got from the audience, they say.

His gumption saved the situation
	

There was widespread speculation recently that a former purohita from the central hills now in the JO was about to pole-vault to yahapalanaya. In the meantime, the politico had to face an unexpected dicey situation.

It was the first day of the new year. About 100 constituents had called at his residence to wish him a happy New Year. At a glance, the politico judged that JO supporters present made up at least one third of the crowd. The others were Green activists most of them wearing shirts sporting the party colour.
The arrival of the Green party activists had been prompted by a rumour that the politico had crossed over to their party the previous day.
The politico immediately judged the situation as being dicey as the two groups from the rival parties known for the cobra-mongoose type enmity could clash at any moment.
The politico warmly welcomed both groups and hosted them to a sumptuous breakfast too. Finding that the tense situation had eased, he had told them that he had no intention to ride elephant-back and he was only waiting for the Pohottuwa to bloom. Subdued by the goodwill generated by the grand treat and the warm welcome, the Green activists had quietly left the place one by one.

Illegal Fishing: 8 Lankans remanded in Seychelles
	
The Magistrate Court of Seychelles has remanded eight Sri Lankan citizens who are suspected of illegal fishing in Seychelles for an extra ten days as the investigation into their case continues, Seychelles News Agency reported.
Seychelles Fishing Authority's legal officer, Yannick Roucou, told SNA that "the suspects will return to court on January 19," after they appeared in court on Monday.
Seychelles, a 115-island archipelago in the western Indian Ocean, has a vast exclusive economic zone of more than 1.3 million square kilometers, and regularly faces illegal fishing problems.
The Sri Lankan-flagged vessel that the suspects were aboard was intercepted by the Seychelles Coast Guard's patrol ship 'Andromache' after it was spotted northeast of Denis Island. This happened during a routine surveillance mission by the Seychelles Air Force Maritime Patrol Aircraft on December 20.
Following consultations with the local fishing authority, the vessel was escorted to Port Victoria, where further investigation was carried out. The vessel which reached the port on December 23 was handed over to the police.
A communiqu from the island nation's Coast Guard stated that this was the second Sri Lankan fishing vessel to be intercepted last year on suspicion of illegal fishing.
The first one - LMUL-A-0520 KLT - was intercepted by coast guard's patrol ship 'Constant' on October 15 after local fishermen alerted relevant authorities. Five people were onboard the vessel.

Indias Supreme Court to consider scrapping countrys  law that bans homosexuality
	

Indias Supreme Court is to consider scrapping a colonial-era law upheld in 2013 that criminalises same sex relationships. 
In a victory for equal rights campaigners, the court said a larger group of judges will re-examine the constitutional validity of Section 377 - a law that prohibits carnal intercourse against the order of nature with any man, woman or animal - which has been widely interpreted to refer to gay sex. 
What is natural to one may not be natural to others, the top court said on Monday. 
A section of people or individuals who exercise their choice should never remain in a state of fear. 
Lawyer Anand Grover, who appeared for five members of the LGBT community who had petitioned the court seeking a review of the ban, said: It is a big relief and a primary step taken by the Supreme Court to review its earlier order. 
The petitioners had told the court they were living in constant fear of police action because of their sexual orientation. 
Indias Supreme Court had in a surprise ruling in 2013 reinstated a ban on gay sex after a four-year period of decriminalisation that had helped bring homosexuality into the open in the socially conservative country.

Indian girl develops rape-proof underwear
	
Uttar Pradesh, (Daily Mail), 8 Jan 2018 - An Indian girl has developed what she claims are rape-proof underwear featuring a lock, a GPS alert for police and a video camera to record an attackers face. 
Seenu Kumari, who was born into a poor family in Farrukhabad, Uttar Pradesh, spent less than 50 in creating the pants which comes with an emergency call button and a combination lock. 
The pink garment, which the teenager is hoping to take to the wider market, is also bulletproof and cannot be cut by a knife. Sexual abuse, rape and child molestation is not uncommon in Uttar Pradesh, with women regularly attacked in the street and rape pornography sold over the counter for as little as 12p.
Kumari said: I have put a smart lock that wont open till you key in the password. I have also installed an electronic device that is equipped with a GPS and calling facility. 
When somebody tries to molest a woman, this device will send out messages to relatives of the woman and also to the police.

There was a time when his grandfather was the undisputed monarch of the upcountry estate-kingdom. The political landscape in the estate-kingdom has undergone much change since then and the grandson, the King Rooster who inherited the grandfathers political mantle no longer reigns supreme there.

There was a time when the lesser mortals in politics in the estate sector came to King Rooster on bended knees seeking party nomination or patronage otherwise. However, the reverse is happening today. King Rooster has to go to now powerful young politicos on bended knees to win them over to his party.
A story that created a sensation in the estate sector recently says that King Rooster called on a candidate in the local polls fray with a big basket of fruits - the way he would visit Kovils  to win him over to his party, they say.

Laugfs Hambantota port LPG venture faces roadblocks
	
Construction of the connecting pipeline of the US$ 80 million LPG import-export terminal of Laugfs Gas PLC in the Hambantota port has been unofficially halted without further explanation, according to the companys head.
We were asked to stop construction of the pipeline, and when we inquired from the official in-charge at Hambantota Port, he said that his superiors asked him to do this, Laugfs Gas PLC Chairman H. K. Wegapitiya told Mirror Business yesterday.
A handful of news websites had reported that the entire terminal construction had been halted, which was inaccurate, according to him.
However, he said that without the pipeline and access to load and offload LPG from the jetty, both of which are now unofficially restricted, the project would become unviable. This has been done unofficially. We didnt get any written document. But, we have all the rights for this project. We have brought this to the notice of the President, Minister Malik Samarwickrama and the Board of Investment, Wegapitiya added.
He refused to speculate on who could have been responsible for creating pressure to halt the pipeline.
The Hambantota Port was given on a 99-year lease to the Chinese state-owned China Merchant Port Holdings (CMPort) in mid-2017 for US$ 1.12 billion and CMPort took over operations of the port last month, which is strategically-important to Chinas One Belt One Road initiative.
CMPH effectively controls 70 percent of the port through two joint venture companies with the Sri Lankan state-owned Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA), which controls the remaining stake in the port.
SLPA Chairman Dr. Parakrama Dissanayake and SLPA Managing Director H. D. A. S. Premachandra could not be reached despite numerous attempts to contact them to obtain a comment on the development.
Ports and Shipping Ministry Secretary L. P. Jayampathy chose to stay out of the issue by stating that the Ministrywhich owns SLPAis only involved with policy making, and not operational aspects.
Laugfs is the only local company to set up major operations in the port, which is situated less than 20 kilometres north of the east-west sea lane, which connects the Far East with the Middle East and Europe, and along which over 200 vessels travel daily.
China built, and later invested in the port due to its importance in Chinas future energy security and geopolitical interests.
Phase one of the storage facility, worth US$ 51.5 million, will be operational this April, since 80 percent of the construction is complete, according to Wegapitiya.
The first phase adds a 30,000metric tonne storage capacity. The second phase, worth US$ 28.5 million, will add another 15,000 metric tonnes of capacity.
This will be able to contribute 6 percent towards the governments US$ 50 billion export target for 2020. We will be exporting 80 percent of the gas to Africa, India, Bangladesh, Myanmmar, and other parts of the region, Wegapitiya said.
The tank farm, coming under the Laugfs subsidiary Laugfs Terminals Ltd., is being financed through equity and corporate guarantees provided by Laugfs. (Chandeepa Wettasinghe)

Moragahakanda Project Resettled villagers now have hope!
	
A survey had been carried out by a team from the Geology Department of the University of Peradeniya on the Moragahakanda Multipurpose Project. Members of the team are of the opinion that if the Kalu Ganga Project was first completed, it would have been an ideal project that would have enhanced values. This is not to say in any way that the Moragahakanda project would be of less value. 
This survey was undertaken by Dr. Lalith Dissanayake and undergraduates of the Geology Department. They covered all aspects of the project. They have found that the people who settled down had been asked to take whatever they wanted from the areas they left, hence their mentality and capacity had increased. They had taken whatever they could like plants and material. This has enabled them to tell others, this is from my old house or that this is a plant brought from the place I lived in. This has given them mental satisfaction when moving from one place to another, a feature which the team found was missing in other projects where people had been displaced. 
According to the original plans, Moragahakanda should have been constructed after the Kalu Ganga Project
	However the Moragahakanda Project is highly regarded and had the least problems
	It has to be said that 10 percent of the settlers had not settled in the new system
The Moragahakanda Project commenced in 2007 as a multipurpose project. The project envisaged to build a dam near the Thalagoda-Moragahakanda Village. Those engaged in the project wanted to collect 521 million cubic metres of water to build the reservoir. But, later, they included the Laggala Pallegama area into the same project and made a dam in Kalu Ganga which resulted in the project being taken over as Moragahakanda and Kalu Ganga Project. When taking into consideration all 13 Mahaweli Projects, Moragahakanda can be termed as a successful venture, but could have been better if the Kalu Ganga Project had been implemented before Moragahakanda, opined Dr Jayasinghe. 
Overcoming hardship
According to Dr. Lalith Dissanayake the purpose of this exercise is to make a study of the settlement of families from the Kalu Ganga Project with the target year being 2011. Further more the intention was to find out how they could move from one place to another with the minimum hardships. Resettlement was one of the major issues associated with this project. But how did they overcome all obstacles or hardship 
Considering all Mahaweli Projects that had come under the various resettlement plans, the Moragahakanda Project had been an exemplary one, according to the survey. 
The findings also show that people received compensation between rupees three lakhs to eighty lakhs. It is reported that those who were moved out of their settlements had hope. Further they had been presented with half and acre of land and another one and half acres for paddy cultivation. 
The settlers who were most contended were those who had been allocated land and paddy lands. 
Contended life
Through this survey, Dr.Lalith Dissanayake observed that the settlers were contended. Thus they were afforded a way of living which was available to them in the settlements they left. They now have luxury vehicles and new gadgets, things which add to leading a contended life. It has to be said that 10 percent of the settlers had not settled in the new system, but there is likelihood of them doing so. 
Also they had been provided with facilities to attend to their daily work. Some of these facilities are wells, water pumps and pipeborne water. 
According to Dr. Lalith Dissanayake the purpose of this exercise is to make a study of the settlement of families from the Kalu Ganga Project with the target year being 2011
Dr. Dissanayake said that the survey team interviewed a person whom they identified as Podi Banda. He said that his family was contented and added that rupees 3000 each had been given monthly to each of the older folk. He said that the land was worth gold and they could make profits out of whatever was planted. But, according to him the main obstacles people had faced before was the lack of water. This was before the new project was completed. Till then water bowsers supported their needs.
According to the original plans, Moragahakanda should have been constructed after the Kalu Ganga Project. But due to tender procedures the work seems to have been delayed. The survey team had noted that this had caused various problems at the beginning due to delays in the Kalu Ganga Project. 
There had been problems due to the shortage of water and this too had been due to the delay in completing the Kalu Ganga Project. However the Moragahakanda Project is highly regarded and had the least problems with regard to resettlement of people. Most people who were resettled were satisfied, according to Dr. Dissanayake.

National Development Banks 2017 in review
	
The year 2017 was a massive success to National Development Bank PLC (NDB), which as a customer-oriented organisation, succeeded in introducing products that not only made life easier but also proved how important the banks client base is to it.
NDB, as a bank that holds over three decades of excellence and experience in financially empowering Sri Lanka, took a greater stride to reach out and provide that strength to the women of Sri Lanka.
NDB has thus far made continuous efforts to empower women through various initiatives significantly through SME and microfinance. As a bank, NDB takes every effort to provide constant encouragement and propel financial guidance for Sri Lankan women with a determination to grow in their life. Thus, NDB Araliya was born in 2017, as one of the greatest product launches.
NDB Araliya is a unique financial proposition that will focus on developing a womans life not only in terms of financial well-being but also in developing her skills, health and intellectuality whilst giving her the strength, security and confidence to realize aspirations in her journey of life.
NDB Araliya holds a host of benefits focused on women. The product comes in with benefits such as a free life insurance and hospitalization cover for the account holder and family members, additional bonus interest, welcome gift on the initial deposit of, free NDB Shilpa childrens savings account upon the birth of a child, a gift on the 21st birthday and much more.
In 2017, NDB also signed an exclusive agreement with the famous singer Umaria Sinhawansa as Brand Ambassador for NDB Araliya savings account.
Empowering women was not all NDB did in the year 2017. One of the most successful promotional campaigns NDB conducted to inculcate the habit of savings was the Kohetath Kalin Kohatah Kalin Avurudu promotion launched by NDB, which resulted in groundbreaking numbers where most of the clientele strived to save more.
NDB has always been persistent and passionate about developing the savings habit in the people of Sri Lanka with a pioneering nationwide savings proposition themed Ithuru Karamu, Api Hademu, Rata Hadamu (Lets Save, Prosper and Build the Nation).
NDB also relaunched its gift scheme for the minor savings accounts, which resulted in more expensive gifts adding more incentive for both parents and children to begin saving for a greater future. It was with this objective in mind that NDB also launched yet another successful promotional campaign to have Santa hand deliver gifts to children during the Christmas season. During the Christmas week, NDB - accompanied by Santa Clause - made home visits to over 500 children who deposited Rs.50,000 or more to their minor savings accounts, islandwide, surprising them with gifts.
In addition to developing a savings habit in the minds of our people, NDB also initiated a novel project to ease of a customers credit card burden. NDB thus launched its credit card balance transfer option in 2017 with attractive handling fees. The repayment tenure of balance transfer is from three months to 36 months to suit the cardholders financial commitments. The monthly fee is as lowest as 0.9 percent on the amounts transferred with no other extra charges/interest. This option would be beneficial especially during a time where consumers are most likely to overwhelmed by credit card bills due to past seasonal spends.
2017 was indeed a year where NDB proved it will always work to satisfy the demands of its customers. NDB remains dedicated to bringing its customers one step closer to accomplishing their lifelong ambitions through the range of services that is accessible through its growing branch network.

North and South Korea on Tuesday agreed on negotiations to resolve problems and military talks aimed at averting accidental conflict, after their first official dialogue in more than two years, as Pyongyangs nuclear weapons program fuels tension.
In a joint statement after the 11-hour talks, the North pledged to send a large delegation to next months Pyeongchang Winter Olympics in the South, but made a strong complaint after Seoul proposed talks to denuclearize the Korean peninsula.
South Korea asked its neighbor to halt hostile acts that stoke tension on the peninsula, and in return, the North agreed that peace should be guaranteed in the region, the Souths unification ministry said in a separate statement.
The talks had been closely watched by world leaders keen for any sign of a reduction in tension, as fears grow over the Norths missile launches and development of nuclear weapons, in defiance of United Nations Security Council resolutions.

President Maithripala Sirisena has sought a determination from the Supreme Court as to when his term will expire, an official said yesterday.
The President is reported to have done so because of an ambiguity on the term limit after the enactment of the 19th Amendment to the Constitution. Earlier, the Constitution said a President was elected for a term of six years but it has been restricted to five years after the enactment of the 19th Amendment. The Supreme Court has listed the case for January 11 and SC determination is to be communicated to the President on January 14.

Silent engines behind agriculture
	
Year 2017 ended up with a huge loss of yield in rice cultivation when compared with the last few years. On the one hand, the reason was the heavy floods which occurred in agricultural areas. Another reason is the restrictions on the herbicides, pesticides and agricultural fertilizers that enhance the yield, as the farmers claim. So farmers are questioning on the big issue in using herbicides and other chemicals but majority of people dont know about the microorganisms who live in soil and within the plant playing a silent,yet a critical role in the development of plants and ultimately on the whole agricultural world.
During the past few decades people were inclined to use pesticides to prevent the damage from pests and herbicides to prevent the growth of weeds in paddy fields. Actually those strategies worked out well but due to the use of its high dosage over the optimum level, it created a highly polluted environment and negatively impacted the beneficial microorganisms for agriculture. It changed the composition and abundance of the beneficial microorganisms for agriculture while changing ecology of the soil.

Things got worsened when people try to do farming without herbicides and pesticides. Since plant beneficial microflora has been absent, growth of weeds have increased more than ever while a lot of diseases and nutrient symptoms can be seen in plants more frequently. One might not agree with that because of the lack of experience on these tiny microbes. But you should believe that chemically high energy consumptive product of nitrate, which is a main compound in fertilizers is produced by these silent workers, free of charge. These little guys fulfil not only nitrogen requirements of the plants but also other nutrients that are essential for the plant growth.
One can question about what they can do in pathogen resistance in upper part since they seem to be limited to the soil. No, that is completely wrong. These microorganisms are living in not only outside of the plant but also within the plant tissues. These microbes secrete chemical compounds that inhibit growth of pathogenic organisms which leads to diseases in plants. These microbes live mutualistically with the plant. Sometimes there will be stress conditions for plants. Specially for rice cultivation there will be floods, droughts, as well as changes in salinity in soil. These endophytic microorganisms protect plants from those stress conditions for zero cents.
Someone might ask how we could enhance this beneficial microflora. Actually it might take a little bit of time. Initially we can introduce beneficial microorganisms as bio-fertilizers to soil. Adding organic fertilizers, giving suitable conditions for the growth of the microbes might increase the colonization of these valuable guys. These microorganisms have a significant role in the protection and growth of the plant by maintaining optimum level of nutrients as well as converting nutrient sources into forms that can be absorbed by plant roots.
The government is focused on a sustainable economy. Sustainability comes through strategies which reap the full benefits of natural resources without destroying those. Empowering and managing these microorganisms is a good strategy for that. So let the silent engines be the noisy ones.

Top Uva politician forced principal to kneel: CHRR
	
The Centre for Human Rights and Research (CHRR) today requested the Education Ministry to look into an incident in Badulla where a top provincial level politician in Uva had forced a school principal to kneel.
In a letter to the Ministry Secretary, CHRR Executive Director Keerthi Tennakoon said they have received information that this politician had summoned a principal of a Tamil girls school in Badulla and forced her to kneel after she refused to follow his orders.
Parents of a student had met the school principal with a letter obtained from the politician to get the student admitted to the school. However, the principal has rejected the letter saying she is not bound to follow orders of politicians but education ministry officials, Mr. Tennakoon said in the letter.
He said after the parents had reported the incident to the politician, he had summoned the principal through provincial education officers and had forced her to kneel and apologise.
This is an uncivilized and inhumane act which degrades the reputation of the public service. Therefore, we request the ministry to look into this issue and take necessary action in this regard, Mr. Tennekoon said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

We never obtain votes by duping the public
	
In the series Direct Talk we feature COPE Chairman Sunil Handunnetti where he airs his views on the latest developments connected with the Bond Commission Report. Following are excerpts of theinterview done with Handunetti.
Q An investigation into the Bond Scam was conducted by the COPE headed by you. The report on the Presidential Commission has also been released. Do you see any contradictions in these two reports 
No there is no difference between the COPE report released by me and the latest report. It has only elaborated on the COPE report. In my report I stated that Arjuna Mahendran is solely responsible for this transaction and the relevant company had earned undue profits.
I requested that these should be taken over again and that the culprits responsible for this be punished.
All these directives are mentioned in my report. Therefore there are no contradictions. Now what remains is legal action to be taken. The report I handed over is similar to a decision made by an umpire in a cricket match. The third umpire now has to give his ruling. 
Q You once wanted to leave the committee saying that you cannot compile your report.Your response.
The latest report has no record of any one interfering and no footnotes by any one. I have mentioned in my report the intimidation I was subjected to. But this intimidation wasnt stated in the latest report. These happenings didnt in any way affect the decisions that were made during COPE sessions. My committee was a divided one. There was a group against this incident while there was another group that was protecting it.The group which was protecting it made footnotes while the others accepted the report. 
Q The UNP maintained that this was a subtle move to attack the party. What do you say 
If any party interfered then it has to accept the blame. If one party brought in the Central Bank Governor and assisted in the transaction, no one can prevent such a party being targeted. Do you mean to say that this party had not done anything and its members werent involved The COPE of course was represented by parties. What about the Presidential Commission Does it belong to the opposition These are absurd views. 
Give us a chance; without which we cannot show you what we can do. We have faith in the masses. For those who have been battered all these years, now it is the opportunity to give us power so that we can make the change you envisage
Q The UNP maintains that they do not want to hide these facts and even the COPE Chairmans post was given to a member of another party with the view of maintaining transparency.Your comments.
I dont want to say anything about it other than laugh. 
Q This Bond issue was brought to light by the JVP. What are you aiming at after the release of thislatest report
It isnt the report that is of importance to the masses, but what action is being taken to punish those found guilty. The COPE findings were sufficient to take legal action, but interference by those wielding power caused a delay. Now its proved beyond any doubt and whats recommended is taking action. It is time to punish the culprits and recover what was gained in an undue manner. 
Q On the subject of Legal issues, the committee has suggested that certain regulations need amendments. But this is time consuming, isnt it 
Just imagine a bank officer giving Rs 5000 to one of his friends. What is the law applicable There cannot be double standards. If a Government servant does something wrong what happens is that he is given a sound beating and then put in remand custody. Questioning comes only thereafter. Why is the same procedure not applied here Leave aside the law, it has been proved that Aloysius and Mahendran are involved in this. Their passports can be impounded and their bank accounts can be frozen. By such acts they can set up a barricade. A situation where you attempt to close the stable after the horse has escaped can now arise. We along with the masses are having doubts regarding this situation. 
Q As COPE Chairman you may have had experiences of how the Government acts in a legal manner.Your response.
I am fully aware of such actions. The Government adopts a lukewarm attitude and both groups are bent on protecting rogues. 
Q The president has said that the report had been forwarded to the Attorney General. Can we have any hopes regarding this move 
We have been harbouring hopes for a long time. During the past 69 years, commissions had been appointed and the masses eagerly awaited them being presented before Parliament. But what was the outcome How many files have been referred to the Attorney Generals Department How many of them keep on circulating Have any of these files returned after necessary action was taken I have given a COPE report, but there has been no reply for the past 15 months. 
Q But SLFP Ministers are claiming that President Sirisena had done something which no other President had done. They reiterate that the follow-up action would also be carried out without a delay.Your comments.
It is very good. We never said that appointing the commission was bad. The President has said that he will use the sword and severe anyones neck. But just keeping the sword to the neck and saying that he will strike is not going to do any good. 
Q The Government is taking steps to establish three special High Courts. Isnt the Government working strenuously to establish the rule of law
As the first case let them take this Bond scam. Once they deliver the verdict we will applaud the work and reveal to the media that establishing these High Courts is very result orienting. Let Rajapaksas issues also be transferred to these courts. 
Q Bandula Gunawardene says that he isnt in agreement with the loss made on the sale of the Bonds, as stated by the commission. Gunawardene states that the loss is much more. Is it true 
What Bandula Gunawardene should do is reveal to the public his assumptions of the loss. We prepared our report and did the calculations without any support from the Central Bank. It was an ordinary audit. It is there even in the Auditor Generals report. The Presidential Commission has also accepted these figures as correct. Gunawardene must affirm now that they are accurate.
Q Since of late there have been many allegations that the JVP is protecting the UNP. Why is the Joint Opposition (JO) making such allegations
How can they make such allegations It is well-known that our relationship is with the masses and not with anyone else. This time the UNP supporters are going to vote for us. The UNP leaders at village level are now contesting from the JVP ticket. There are several from the Flower Bud also supporting us. What you said is correct, but we arent visiting them in the night in order to obtain settlements regarding legal issues or to enter into deals.

What you said is correct, but we arent visiting them in the night in order to obtain settlements regarding legal issues or to enter into deals
Q However much you argue, the JVP has faced a severe setback in the recent past. 
Wait until February 10th. You will then realize. Dont be hasty. We admit that there was a setback when analyzing the results of past elections. The electoral system greatly influenced it. There are only 06 JVP members in Parliament, but we received over 500,000 votes. The TNA has 16 members with a voting strength of 300,000. Is there any setback in our party We never obtain votes by duping the public. These are valuable votes and they are not obtained through giveaways. 
Q There is much talk both inside and outside Parliament that the duties of the opposition appears to have been carried out poorly.Your comments.
Not ours. The Opposition Leaders task hasnt been effectively performed. Sampanthan raises his hand in support of the Budget and when Ravi resigns he says it is not correct to do so. Even the members of the JO are also like him.When Hambantota Port was allowed a 32-year tax amnesty they refrained from opposing it. For what reasons did they not oppose this Has the JO and Mahinda Rajapaksa ever voted against any single Budget Why did they oppose the womens representation when the Local Council Bill was passed
"I have mentioned in my report the intimidation I was subjected to"
	"In my report I stated that Arjuna Mahendran was solely responsible for this transaction"
	Howmany similar files have been sent to the AG
	My committee was a divided one
	It isnt the report that is of importance, but what action is being taken to punish those guilty
	Once they deliver theverdict well applaud the work and reveal to the media that establishing High Courts is very result orienting
Q There is a charge against you that you objected to youth representation.Your comments.
No. In our lists there is youth representation. There was a limit with regard to youth representation, but it was removed at the last minute. 
Q Government Ministers blame you for inciting the public and students, specially on the SAITM issue. What is your response
You only mention the few accusations directed at our party. But what about the good that we have done You said early that we are having deals with the Government and now say that we are inciting the public against the Government. Why are these types of charges being made When issues confronting the public emerged it was our party that stood up and not those who hold media conferences.
Q Despite you representing the party at each public issue, you have failed to achieve favourable results. Your comments. 
We have never mislead the people. It is the Government that misleads them. Now see they are saying that SAITM will be abolished. 
Q Why are you against private education Is it bad for the country 
What about our Universities Arent they good Isnt it better for the less affluent to receive an education along with the rich 
Q The Minister of Higher Education states that students go abroad in search of these Universities and our foreign exchange resources are getting affected. Your comments. 
The countrys foreign reserves are not dwindling because of these reasons. The money that the Higher Education Ministers play out from the highways arent invested here. The undue gains made through the Bond Scam arent invested here. Are they trying to save the little foreign exchange they can make through a couple of students who migrate for studies International schools have been opened here, but has that stopped students from migrating to continue with their studies 
Q The leftist parties had helped the rightists to assume power. Do these parties continue to win the confidence of the public
The JVP has never helped such parties in that manner. Once it helped the UPFA Government in order to help them to end the war. During the past 69 years you have voted for them, despite being frustrated. That is why we are asking you to vote for the JVP. Give us a chance; without which we cannot show you what we can do. We have faith in the masses. For those who have been battered all these years, now it is the opportunity to give us power so that we can make the change you envisage.

Weinstein accusers say they werent invited to Golden Globes
	

DPA, 09th JANUARY, 2018
Two of the loudest voices in the ongoing sexual assault scandals sweeping Hollywood have slammed the fakery of their peers at this years Golden Globes.
Actresses Rose McGowan and Asia Argento sent shockwaves through the film industry last year when they accused producer Harvey Weinstein of sexual assault.
But both women said on Monday that they were not invited to Sundays awards ceremony.
Prominent industry figures from Oprah Winfrey to Nicole Kidman and James Franco wore black during the awards in protest at gender inequality and abuse.
But on Monday, McGowan called it Hollywood fakery while retweeting a message from Argento which said No one should forget that you were the first one who broke the silence.
