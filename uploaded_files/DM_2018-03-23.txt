A preface to Planetary Conjunctions  Graha Samyoga
	

There are instances where two or more planets occupy one Zodiacal sign. This occurrence is referred to in Astrology as planetary conjunctions or Graha Samyoga.
Every planet except the nodes Rahu and Ketu emits certain type of rays and creates its own sphere of influence in the Zodiacal sign it occupies or transits. When another planet enters the same sign radiating its own rays the entire character of the sign would undergo change.

Friendship and enmity between planets
Rays of one planet would get either intensified or counteracted by those of another planet entering its longitude. If Planet A intensifies the rays of Planet B, Planet A and Planet B are considered `friends. If C counteracts the rays of D, Planets C and D are considered `enemies.
The length of one Rashi or sign in the Zodiac is 30 degrees. And if the two planets in one sign are say 28 degrees far apart, the effect their Samyoga or conjunction can produce is very little or negligible.
On the other hand, if there are two planets in two neighboring signs near the cusp between them, their conjunction or Samyoga becomes more effective and it would produce stronger results, good or bad depending on the nature of the two planets or the `friendship or the `enmity between them.

Two planets under one constellation
Effects planetary conjunctions produce vary depending on the sign and the House or Bhava where they occur as well as strengths and weaknesses of the planets. Two planets coming under one and the same constellation too are considered to form a conjunction.

Planets losing or gaining strength in conjunctions
Sun and Jupiter are the most powerful planets in the Zodiac. When another planet joins Sun or Jupiter in the same sign, they would not suffer a diminution of their strengths. However, other planets conjoining them would lose their strength and characteristics to some extent. Mercury and Moon are the two planets who are completely overpowered by other planets. These two planets undergo a complete change in their nature and characteristics when another planet conjoins them.

Jupiter-Saturn conjunction
Jupiter-Saturn Samyoga is considered very favourable, because it leads to diminution of evil influences of Saturn and intensification of Jupiters benevolent character.

Moon-Saturn conjunction
Moon-Saturn Samyoga produces an entirely different result. Moons good characteristics disappear and Saturns evil qualities become dominant in such a union. The results that this Samyoga produces are misery, suffering, disease, and loss of money, lands and even the good name. However, this Samyoga endows the native with the qualities of endurance and reliance.

Exceptions to the general rule
Mars-Moon Samyoga, which Indian astrologers hail as Chandramangala Yoga is considered unfavourable for females, according to veteran Sri Lankan astrologer Hendrick de Silva Hettigoda. Indian Rishi Varahamihira says in his celebrated work `Brihat Jataka that native born with Moon-Mars conjunction would eventually turn out to be a bad son to his mother and an unscrupulous trader.
Hettigoda says he has found through experience that Moon-Jupiter Samyoga too is not favourable in certain instances. He says that he had found marriage had been an utter failure in cases where Moon-Jupiter conjunction had occurred in the 2nd or the 7th House.
Hettigoda says that despite Jupiter and Venus are called `enemies in Astrological parlance, their conjunction produces very favourable results.

## Title: Anaemia An Erythrocytes Nemesis
## Section: Medicine

Anaemia An Erythrocytes Nemesis
	

When considering the diseases that could be inflicted upon the human body, its unfortunate to state that there is no part of the body thats spared under the fate of malady. From the bodys largest organ, the skin to the smallest of cells that make up the body tissues and organs, there is some disease in the world to inflict any of them. Anaemia is a condition caused due to issues that arise in the red blood cells of the human body. Prof.Arjuna De Silva, Professor in Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Ragama, addressed the medical malady, known as anaemia. 

Definition
Anaemia is the condition where there is a reduction in the amount of red blood cells produced in the body, leading to the lack of haemoglobin, stated Prof. De Silva. The human body consists of many types of cells. The red blood cells are a type of blood cell. Also known as erythrocytes, these red blood cells are responsible for transporting oxygen to and from all parts of the body as well as removing carbon dioxide from these parts of the body. The red blood cells perform this function with the assistance of a pigment known as haemoglobin which helps the erythrocytes to bind with oxygen in order to transport the gas. Higher the availability of haemoglobin, the higher the capacity of oxygen transported by the red blood cells. The pigment is also responsible for giving red blood cells their red colour, which in turn gives blood its red colour. Anaemia occurs due to either decreased haemoglobin in the red blood cells or decreased numbers of erythrocytes which interferes with their functions in transporting oxygen and other gases. 
The shortage of red blood cells in the body gives rise to anaemic conditions. Prof. De Silva explained that this shortage can occur in two ways. It can occur either due to decreased production of the red blood cells or increased destruction of the cells, he said. He further mentioned that 90% of the erythrocytes are mainly produced from the red bone marrow of the bones. The blood of a normal healthy female adult consists of 4-5 million red blood cells per micro litre of blood whereas the blood of a normal healthy male contains 5-6 million erythrocytes per micro litre. Red blood cells last for about 120 days before they are destroyed by the spleen and liver. A cause of increased destruction of red blood cells is due to the deformities in the shapes of red blood cells. The Haemoglobin pigment consists of iron and protein. Iron deficiency in a person can lead to anaemia due to reduced haemoglobin in the body. Microcytic anaemia occurs when the red blood cells are smaller than usual whereas macrocytic anaemic patients have red blood cells which are larger in size than usual, elucidated Prof. De Silva. 
According to the Professor, Vitamin B12 and folic acid are necessary constituents in the production of red blood cells. When there is a deficiency in these substances it affects the production of red blood cells which could also be another cause that would lead to anaemia in a patient. The failure of bone marrow to produce adequate amounts of red blood cells could also be influenced by cancer cells, radiation treatments for cancers, immunotherapies and conditions such as fibrosis, he added.
The destruction of the red blood cells could occur due to abnormalities in its shape. Thalassemia which is a congenital condition that arises from birth is also one such instance where red bood cells are destroyed due to the abnormal shape of the red blood cells. The shape of the cells can be affected by external agents that lead to deformation at a later stage in life. All these factors lead to the destruction of erythrocytes. The enlargement of the spleen due to other conditions could also affect the destruction of red blood cells and give rise to anaemic conditions. Haemorrhoids and menstruation in females increase the tendencies for causing anaemic conditions, informed the Professor. 

Diagnosis and treatment
The main symptoms are non-specific ones such as weakness and lethargy among other signs such as pale skin, dizziness and shortness of breath. Depending on the cause and addressing those causes specifically through treatment, anaemia can be cured successfully. So detection as early as possible is vital. The patient is examined clinically. Eyes, tongue, hands are checked for paleness. Prof. De Silva stated that a full blood count is enough of a diagnostic measure to detect anaemia along with a pretty clear indication of the cause for it. The diagnosis of diseases does not always require complex procedures. A simple test may be sufficient to reveal it all.
There are many treatments available for anaemia. Bone marrow transplant is also a possibility and is available in the island. Identifying the root cause of the anaemic condition and directly treating the condition can lead to recovery. For instance if a patient suffers from anaemia due to iron deficiency, a prescription of iron tablets is one way of treating it, he explicated. Great attention should be paid to an anaemic patients diet which should consist of a nutritionally balanced meal with more weight towards foods such as spinach and other green leafy vegetables which are rich in iron. A good balance of legumes, pulses and cereals will also contribute towards the sustainance of health. Animal liver and eggs are also a good source of nutrition for an anaemic patient. For vegetarians the usual question of fulfilling their nutritional requirements will spring up. For those who are not willing to consume meat and eggs, they should take supplementary iron tablets to fulfill their iron requirements, he advised.


Risk groups and disease prevalence
According to Prof. De Silva, the main risk groups susceptible to anaemia are females of child bearing age and especially schoolgirls. This is due to the lack of proper nutrition in the diet due to their busy lifestyle and monthly menstruation which makes females easy victims to iron deficiency and thereby anaemia, he warned. 
Speaking of the anaemic frequency in the country the Professor pointed out that over the past 20-30 years in Sri Lanka, anaemia was a problem especially with the hookworm infestation. Hookworms infect the small intestine, feeding on the blood causing the red blood cells to burst and degrade the haemoglobin available. However the prevalence of anaemia in the country at present is very low compared to the past. With increased awareness regarding the topic, a well balanced diet as well as healthy life patterns and thanks to the availability of treatment and progression of health services the anaemic tendency has declined to great extents, the Professor added.

Confidante failed to confide in him
	

A high political authority has reportedly developed a sudden antipathy towards a KKS whom he looked on as a close confidante for several years.

The KKS who also served the political authority as a reliable informer as well, was in the habit of carrying tales about other employees to the boss. Meanwhile, another office aide had informed the politico that his faithful KKS father successfully contested the recent mini-polls on the Pohottuwa ticket and the latter had expressed his surprise saying it was news to him. The Ministry employees believe that the political authority had developed the sudden dislike to his erstwhile confidante as the latter had kept him in the dark about his fathers political connection to Pohottuwa. The KKS who is now being ignored by the political authority is about to be transferred out, say the employees.

First rebels leave Syria enclave under Russia-brokered deal
	

Syrian rebels and their families began leaving Syrias Eastern Ghouta on Thursday under the first evacuation deal in the shrinking opposition enclave outside Damascus. 
The agreement, announced on Wednesday and brokered by regime ally Russia, could empty one of three rebel-held pockets in the region and mark a major advance in government efforts to secure the nearby capital. 
It could also increase pressure on rebels to follow suit in the two other opposition-held pockets of the besieged enclave, where tens of thousands of civilians remain trapped under relentless bombardment. 
State television said around 1,824 people -- including 319 fighters -- had boarded buses from the Eastern Ghouta town of Harasta, until now held by the Ahrar al-Sham rebel group. 
A military source told AFP the rebels and accompanying civilians had boarded buses and were in a buffer zone, waiting to cross into regime-controlled territory. 
Another military source said around 2,000 people are expected to leave in total, including around 700 fighters on Thursday. 
Ahrar al-Sham spokesman Munzer Fares said the evacuations could last several days. 
They followed renewed air strikes in Ghouta early on Thursday which killed 20 civilians, according to the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.

Human hand  trailblazer of Human Civilization
	
In last weeks article we discussed four favourable Yogas formed on the palm. We propose to examine a few more favourable Yogas today.

Budha Yoga: This Yoga is formed when there is a well-developed Mount of Mercury in the right hand and a line from the Moon reaching it in a bow-like curve. This line should not be broken, chained or very thick. (See figure 1 below)
Result: A person endowed with this Yoga achieves great success as an entrepreneur or a businessman. He expands his business to foreign lands as well. He is capable of taking quick and correct decisions. He is well- known for his business acumen and wisdom. He eliminates his enemies, rivals and opposition.

Gajalakshmi Yoga: The features that combine to form this Yoga are: In both hands, the Fate line originating from the bracelets goes up to the Mount of Saturn. There is a thin fairly long Sun line originating above the Head line. Head and Health lines are prominent. (Figure 2)
Result: Even if the native has been born into a humble poor family, he would rise to a very high position. He would acquire knowledge, fame and wealth. He would have a reputation as a righteous and virtuous person. He would excel in his chosen field outshining others. He would amass wealth from foreign trade or work in a foreign country. His fame would survive his death for long years. If the Yoga is formed only in one hand, the effects of the Yoga would get reduced by a half.

Indra Yoga: This Yoga is produced when the subject has well developed Mounts of Mars, and a long, straight, and clear Head and Fate lines. (Figure 3)
Result: The subject endowed with this Yoga would become an army commander or a high ranking officer in the Police skilled in the martial arts of overpowering enemies. He would live like a king with servants and subordinates at his beck and call. He would be a pleasing conversationalist. His simple and affable manners win for him the respect and regard of all who come across him. His rise to great heights would begin at the age of twenty-eight. Very often people blessed with this Yoga die prematurely. They gain much fame and honour during the short span of their life.

Lagnadhi Yoga: A person with all fully developed Mounts and Mercury line at full length enjoys the benefits of this Yoga. (Figure 4)
Result: The subject is well educated and very clever. He is also a good orator. He is healthy, strong and handsome. He possesses noble qualities. He is not interested in worldly pleasures. He becomes either a great social worker or a great religious missionary.

Marut Yoga: A well-developed Mount of Venus with no obstructing lines, a strong, straight and clear Moon line and a clear Mount of Jupiter with a `cross on it combine to form this Yoga. (Figure 5)
Result: A person endowed with this Yoga has pleasing manners. He is large hearted and is prepared to help anyone in need without expecting any reward. He has a cheerful disposition. People with this Yoga become successful businessmen. They work according to a pre-set agenda and are good at time management.

Parvata Yoga: The features that combine to form this Yoga are the Fate line, thin, deep and clear and unbroken proceeding from the bracelets to the Mount of Saturn and a fish-shaped formation at the origin of the line. (Figure 6)
Result: The subject is a self-made man. He successfully accomplishes whatever task he undertakes. He receives a good education. He liberally helps the poor and the destitute. He is highly respected in society. He would never suffer from want. People endowed with this Yoga cannot become successful politicians, but they earn the trust and friendship of those holding high political office.

Little Hearts Pens and Pencils immensely contribute to the big-hearted project
	
The official handing over of the donation by Asitha Wijerathne  Group Managing Director/Founder, DSL Enterprises (Pvt.) Ltd. to Dr. Duminda Samarasinghe  Consultant Pediatric Cardiologist
In September 2017 DSL Enterprises (Pvt.) Ltd. announced their support in the funding of the Little Hearts Project by introducing the Speed Little Hearts Pens and Camlin Little Hearts Pencils. 20% and 13% of the earnings from the sales of these custom products were to be donated to the project.
Completing the first phase of the donation within a few months, DSL announced the handing over of Rs. 20million to the Little Hearts Fund at a media conference held on 22ndMarch 2018 at the Lady Ridgeway Hospital.
The Little Hearts project was initiated by the Sri Lanka College of Paediatricians, together with several organizations to build the Cardiac and Critical Care Complex at the Lady Ridgeway Hospital. The complex will be dedicated to the task of treating children afflicted with Congenital Heart Diseases (CHD), with which over 3,000 children are being born every year in Sri Lanka.
The Little Hearts Pens and Pencils are a simple and most cost effective way in which the general public can contribute to the project. The pens and pencils are priced at reasonable rates, enabling every kind-hearted person to contribute towards saving a childs life. Being day to day commodities, pens and pencils hardly require consideration at the point of buying. However, since the Little Hearts Pens and Pencils are specifically marketed to raise funds for the Little Hearts project, the customer can make a conscious choice to contribute and be a part of the deserving venture.
Reporting the progress of the project Dr. Duminda Samarasinghe, the Consultant Paediatric Cardiologist at the Lady Ridgeway Hospital stated that over 250 million rupees have been accumulated through donors. It is further supported with another Rs. 170 million pledged from two organizations and Rs. 300 million allocated from the national budget by the Sri Lankan Government. The piling for the complex is set to commence in May 2018. The call for tenders for pile construction has been published in the newspapers on 4th February 2018 and the pre-bid meeting was held on 20th of the same month. The Sri Lanka Navy will be responsible for construction and the complex is to be handed over to the hospital in November 2019, he added.
We are humbled and proud to be able to achieve this milestone in our pledge because it is not a mere social responsibility project to us at DSL, but a need of the country. We are grateful to our customers who have loyally bought the Speed Little Hearts Pens and Camlin Little Hearts Pencils, especially the school children who have continued to buy it, stated Mr. Asitha Wijerathne, the Group Managing Director and Founder of DSL Enterprises (Pvt) Ltd. The organization has initiated several CSR projects but the Little Hearts projects remains the most valuable to us. All our internal and external stakeholders have come together to achieve this goal to which we are greatly thankful, he added further.

HINDUSTAN TIMES, 22nd MARCH, 2018- Maldives President Abdulla Yameen on Thursday lifted a 45-day state of emergency which had outlawed protests amid political upheaval on the Muslim-majority Indian Ocean island chain.
Yameen imposed the emergency on February 5 for 15 days after a Supreme Court ruling quashed convictions against nine opposition leaders and ordered his government to free those held in prison.
He extended the state of emergency by another 30 days with parliament approval, a move challenged by the opposition.

No-faith motion targets President, Speaker: Arjuna
	
The real target of the No-confidence motion submitted by the Joint Opposition was not the Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe but the President Maithripala Sirisena and the Speaker Karu Jayasuriya, Petroleum Industries Minister Arjuna Ranatunga said yesterday.
He said more details would be revealed soon and underscored the fact that the UNP and the Prime Minister were in a better position right now than in the aftermath of the LG polls.
The minister told a media conference that however he was disappointed and unhappy over the lackluster performance of the Yahapalana government to bring to book the murderers and fraudsters engaged in big-time financial crimes like money laundering, embezzlement, bribery and other misdeeds under the Mahinda Rajapaksa regime.
"The motion was planned by those who have no future in politics. They expect to come to Parliament after the next general elections through the back door because none of them could win in an election," he said. The mandate given to the President and the Prime Minister in January and August 2015 by 6.2 million voters was not to bring down the cost of living or reduce prices of essential commodities but to put an end to the widespread corruption, nepotism, mismanagement and restore the rule of law, independence of the judiciary and the media and strengthen democratic establishments. The government has done much to fulfil those pledges except arresting the big fish involved in corruption and crime."
Commenting on the government's electoral setback at the LG polls, the minister said the Yahapalana government had failed to market its people-friendly policies and relief and facilities provided to the people during the past three years.
The government's propaganda machine during the LG election campaign was an utter failure. It did not take the message of good governance, the benefits enjoyed by the masses, increase in salaries of public servants by Rs.10,000, the price reduction of most essential commodities, the price reduction in medicine, fuel and transport fare and power tariff, constitution of independent commissions etc and restoring of Sri Lankas good name among the global community to the people in a convincing manner, the minister said.
He said he also at fault for not marketing his people-friendly projects as a minister because he never liked to give priority to publicity or politics.
Responding to the Daily Mirror, the minister said it was the responsibility of the UNP and the SLFP to protect good governance because this was a coalition. At the 2015 general election, the voters did not give an absolute majority to any of the two main parties. Therefore, both parties have a mandate to rule the country until 2020 jointly.

People decry waste of public funds
	

The preparations, now underway to re-carpet the road leading to the Diyawanna palace, have raised many an eyebrow, they say.

Many people in the area wonder why the authorities concerned are in a mighty hurry to break up this road which is in good condition for re-carpeting. They say that it is a crime to spend public funds on the Diyawanna access road which requires no repairs or improvement when there is a crying need to build new roads in the countrys backwoods where a sizable segment of the population has no access to a road for a mile or two from their homes. There are many villages in our country which are not accessible by a motor vehicle. It is a big problem for these villagers to take a bad patient to hospital in an emergency. But the authorities are more concerned about mollycoddling the haves like the 225 visitors to the Diyawanna palace, they say.

Meanwhile, a top cop had reportedly received okay from those in the highest echelons to take legal action against the pompous politico for making defamatory remarks about him while staging the recent highway drama.

Rs.6 mn worth Ice detected
	
Two youths have been taken into custody by Talaimannar Police while in possession of 300 grams of Crystal Methamphetamine, a stimulant drug popularly known as Ice worth over Rs 6 million.
Following a tip off, the suspects aged 16 and 23 were taken into custody last morning outside the Talaimannar Hospital when they were transporting the narcotics via a motorcycle.
Ice is one of the most destructive drugs in the illicit market, in its physical, mental and behavioral effects and is a popular drug among foreign tourists.
Speaking to Daily Mirror, a Police Narcotics Bureau (PNB) flying squad officer said the current wholesale market price of 1 gram of Ice is over Rs. 20,000.
It is also referred to as shabu, crystal, crystal meth or d-meth. Ice is the purest and most potent form of methamphetamine that comes as a powder or crystals that are usually snorted, injected or smoked.
However, it is not a popular drug in Sri Lanka due to its high price but is commonly trade around tourist hotels.
The PNB officer said that earlier the narcotic was smuggled into the country from Iran and Iraq but it was learnt that the drug is now popular in different parts of the world mainly in Eastern Europe, South East Asia, South Africa and Australia.
According to Police the drug has frequently been detected in low quantities by drug prevention agencies in Sri Lanka as of recent times. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

Showing TB patients the road to recovery
	

As much as it would be a daunting experience to endure living with a communicable disease as Tuberculosis (TB) it is by no means an easy task when confronted with deteriorating health and the stigma often associated with this ailment. If it wasnt for the discovery of TB bacillus, in 1882, by Dr. Robert Koch the causative factor behind TB would still remain a mystery. The National Programme for Tuberculosis Control and Chest Diseases (NPTCCD) of the Ministry of Health together with the Nutrition & Indigenous Medicine plans to organize a national level event in Colombo on March 24 (Saturday) with the participation of health workers and all the other key stakeholders, aiming at the improvement of programmes related to TB control, treatment and prevention in Sri Lanka. NPTCCDs theme for this years World Tuberculosis Day is Wanted: Leaders for a TB free world, you can make history. End TB.

In an attempt to put World Tuberculosis Day under the spotlight, todays Health Capsule will shed more light on TB; an epidemic deemed to be a global health challenge. In conversation with Health Capsule, District TB Control Officer of the District Chest Clinic - Gampaha attached to the National Programme for Tuberculosis Control and Chest Diseases, Dr. A.Ramachandran explicated the intricacies evolving around TB and what should be done to prevent oneself from falling prey to such an infectious disease.

A disease that spreads throughthe air
Explaining what the disease is, Dr. Ramachandran said that TB is an infectious disease caused by a bacteria known as MYCOBACTREIUMTUBERCULOSIS. The disease could occasionally be caused by MYCOBAETERIUM BOVIS and MYCOBACTERIUM AFRICANUM. TB mainly affects the lungs (80% ), but it could affect any part of the body except hair and nails . The commonest sites that could be affected other than the lungs are Lymph nodes in the neck, Pleura ( covering around the Lung ), vertebral column and others explained Dr. Ramachandran. 
Elaboroating on how the disease could spread, he said that TB spreads through the air as droplet nuclei. When a patient with TB of the lungs, mainly a person with a progressive disease coughs or laughs or talks aloud, they release the bacteria into the air as droplet nuclei. A person who inhales this air will get infected. All people who are infected dont develop the disease. To explain it further, if 100 people are infected 10 will develop the disease. The risk of developing the disease is greatest during the first 2 years after infection. However, this also depends on the infected persons immunity and the duration he or she remains in contact with the diseased person, he added. Stating that TB is completely curable, Dr. Ramachandran added that the outcome is optimal when the disease is detected early and treated with quality assured drugs for the recommended duration of treatment.

When a person does not take treatment properly, his or her disease will not be cured


Causative factors and risk groups
According to the doctor, the development of the disease in an infected person is largely dependent on his immunity. If a diseased person (index patient) has extensive progressive disease ( large number of bacilli in the Lungs ) and has prolonged contact with his people nearby, then the infected people have a greater chance of contracting the disease. Moreover, in the event, the infected person lives in a crowded and dark environment with less ventilation, then the chances of developing the disease is higher. Similarly if the infected person is malnourished or suffers from diseases like diabetes or cancer, such people are more prone to develop TB. HIV infected people when in close contact with a TB patient has a greater chance of developing TB. People who smoke , consume alcohol or substance abusers have a greater chance of developing TB. 
People living in overcrowded settings such as slums, camps, homes, rehab centres and those who are engaged in certain professions such miners, building workers are identified as vulnerable groups prone to contract or develop the disease. Also, smokers, alcoholics, substance abusers and HIV infected people including patients with certain diseases such as diabetes or cancer can be listed as vulnerable groups for TB he said. 
Red flag signs
Cough lasts more than 2 weeks 
	Low grade Fever 
	Loss of weight or wasting 
	Sweats in the night 
In addition patients could have, 
Shortness of breath 
	Chestpain 
	Haemoptysis 
	Loss of appetite 
	Tiredness 
Adding that patients with Extra Pulmonary TB ( excluding Lung ) would not have cough or chest related symptoms, but will present with other symptoms, Dr. Ramachandran further explained that all patients who take their prescribed treatment properly will have little chance of contracting the disease again. Therefore, TB is totally curable. 

Diagnosis and treatment
Elucidating that TB is mainly diagnosed by obtaining a patients sputum, he said that the sputum sample will be smeared and stained with Zeil Nielson stain and examined under a microscope. This is also known as the Sputum Smear Examination. 
In addition to the Sputum Smear Examination, Chest X rays are commonly used in diagnosing the disease. TB culture is known as the gold standard in the diagnosis of TB . Lowenstein Jennson Medium Culture is the traditional culture method, but it would take 2-3 months to determine the diagnosis in some patients. 
Nowadays a culture method known as Rapid Liquid Culture ( Bactec ) is available which can give a diagnosis for TB in 2 weeks. 
In the last 2 years, a molecular diagnostic test method known as Xpert MTB/ Rif ( commercially known as Gene Xpert) which can give a diagnosis in 2-4 hours after the sample is collected put into the machine. It is a rapid diagnostic method. The National Programme for Tuberculosis Control and Chest Diseases (NPTCCD ) is making every effort to make this test widely available in the country. Already 11 Gene Xpert machines are in use throughout the country. Choice of a culture method is dependent on the patients clinical situation. Culture tests are requested when there is a strong clinical suspicion of TB and the sputum smear examination has failed to give the diagnosis. In addition a skin injection test known as Mantoux test is used in the diagnosis of TB, he explained.

He took this opportunity to make known to all that obtaining a correct sample of sputum (not saliva ) is the key in the diagnosis of TB. Patients should be given the idea that it has to come from the chest. The patient is advised to breathe in and out 2- 3 times, cough well and bring out the sputum . It should be done in a well ventilated open area with sunlight falling over the area. TB patients could be broadly classified into New patients (who get TB for the first time ) and Previously treated patients. Previously treated patients are those who develop TB again, who do not progress on their treatment as expected ( failure ) or those who interrupt their treatment (Defaulters or Lost to follow up ). Most of them are treated with 4 types of oral antibiotics namely Isoniazid, Rifampicin, Pyrazinamide and Ethambutol. Some of the previously treated patients may require Streptomycin in addition as an injection. He said that many new patients are treated for 6 months. However, previously treated patients will be treated for 8 months. In some special cases of TB like TB meningitis and Spinal TB, patients are treated for a period of one year.
When a patient does not take his treatment properly, his disease will not be cured. His lungs will be damaged badly and he will have difficulty in breathing. He may die of the disease and can easily spread the disease to those who are very close to him like his own family members. Further, a patient who doesnt take his treatment regularly will develop drug resistance also known as MULTI DRUG RESISTANT TB (MDR-TB). This is a very difficult form of TB to treat. The people who are closer to these patients will also develop the same form of TB that is difficult to treat. For the past 10 years TB has shown a static pattern in Sri Lanka. 8,500- 9,000 cases of TB are diagnosed each year, Dr. Ramachandran said. MDR TB for the moment remains as a less of a threat with 10- 12 cases being diagnosed each year . 
TB is a totally curable disease. The best way to protect yourself from TB is to help identify people with symptoms of TB.The diagnosed patients should be helped in taking their treatment properly. TB patients after taking their treatment for about a month are almost non infectious. They cannot pass the disease to another person. We should not shun TB patients. The stigma that is associated with TB patients should be removed. This is done by making our TB patients feel wanted and by treating them as fellow human beings, with compassion. This way we could protect them and ourselves from the risk of TB, he concluded.

Standing in solidarity against violence
	
Located in the heart of the Anamaduwa town is a restaurant owned by Mohamed Naufer, a gentleman who peacefully catered to the needs of all his customers for 30 long years. Popular among the residents in the area for his humbleness, Naufer always ensured his customers wore a broad smile of satisfaction when they stepped out of his restaurant. Needless to say, one can hardly find any who hadnt sipped a cup of tea or enjoyed a meal from his restaurant.
However, an unruly mob had thrown a petrol bomb at the restaurant on March 11 at the most ungodly hours of 2.00 a.m. It was surprising that the fire was doused by the villagers even before the restaurant owner arrived at the scene. The adjoining communication centre had also caught fire. Yet, what intrigues us the most is Naufers silence against this heinous act.
While the security forces made themselves busy with arresting those responsible, trader associations and residents in the area united to rebuild the restaurant. The Sinhalese, Tamils and the Muslims got together for this worthy cause. Anamaduwa Police arrested seven individuals including a schoolboy and the son of a police officer and produced themin court.

Sumanthiran-Tamil diaspora engage US on SL
	
A joint delegation of the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) and the Global Tamil Forum (GTF) visited the United States of America at a time when Sri Lanka was under scrutiny at the UN in Geneva, with appointments secured from the highest levels of authority at the UN, US Administration and Government, and the Norwegian Government, the GTF said in a statement.
The delegation included TNA's M. A. Sumanthiran, GTF President S.J. Emmanuel, now resident in Sri Lanka, and members of various organisations from the US - United States Tamil Political Action Council (USTPAC), Canada - Canadian Tamil Congress (CTC), Norway - Norwegian Tamil Forum (NTF), Australia and Britain.
The statement said, This visit at this critical juncture was based on TNA's and GTF's continued engagement with the Sri Lankan Government to encourage implementing their 2015 manifesto commitments and commitments made to all Sri Lankans and the international community.
This visit was significant especially considering that the US still has not appointed an Ambassador in Geneva.
The primary objective of the visit was to brief the officials and governments, of the ground reality, considering the deteriorating situation with law and order, appraisal of status on the constitutional reform process and implementation of UNHRC resolutions 30/1 and 34/1.
Among other serious concerns, the delegation discussed the need to demand the Government of Sri Lanka to commit to a time-bound implementation plan of resolutions 30/1 & 34/1 of the UNHRC and the need for UNHRC monitoring and oversight over Sri Lanka, beyond March 2019.
The delegation was delighted that the UN Under Secretary General for Political Affairs, Jeffrey Feltman and Director for Asia and Pacific Division, Mari Yamashita with her team spent a substantial amount of time discussing their observations and of hearing out concerns of the delegation, at the main UN building in New York. USG Feltman's team has been to Sri Lanka only weeks ago and had a very good understanding of the current political situation.
"Deputy US Permanent Representative to the UN, Ambassador Kelley E. Currie, who is also the Representative to the United Nations Economic and Social Council, met the delegates at the US Mission at the UN Plaza, 1st Avenue. Ambassador Currie was well informed, reiterated US government commitment for the full implementation of HRC resolution 30/1 and promised to discuss points of concerns with the missions in Geneva and in Colombo.
"Similarly, the Norwegian Permanent Representative to the UN Ambassador Tore Hattrem also agreed to share the delegation's concerns with Oslo and the Norwegian Mission in Geneva recognizing the need for a time-bound implementation plan with benchmarks.
"Tuesday, 20 March 2018, the delegation met with Ambassador Alice J Wells, Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for South and Central Asia and her senior staff, at the State Department in Washington DC. Ambassador Wells too was well informed, very engaged and discussed options and alternatives by way of questions and answers. Ambassador Wells also promised to discuss points of concerns with the missions in Geneva and in Colombo," it said.

Taking a look at active healthy ageing
	

1/3 rd of the above 60 population has experienced a fall during older age. While falls are more common among senior citizens, the consequences of falls are also quite severe when compared to the younger population. In todays continuation of the last weeks article on falls among the elderly, we will discuss the consequences of falls and the actions that we could take to prevent them. Health Capsule consulted Dr. Dilhar Samaraweera, Consultant Physician of the Colombo South Teaching Hospital and Founder President of the Geriatric Association, Sri Lanka, to obtain information on the topic. 
The after-effects of a fall are not always physical, but can be psychological and social as well, especially in the elderly, according to Dr. Samaraweera. 
Physical injuries can range from scraped knees to major trauma, commonly fractures. With their bones being already frail, hip fractures are a common occurrence, which cause the patient to be immobile for long periods of time due to the slow rate of healing. This would in turn give rise to other complications like bedsores and chest infections, the consequences of which can be devastating. In addition, vertebral fractures are also common, which causes the risk of damage to the spinal cord. Another serious trauma like bleeding into the brain can also be caused by falls, explained the doctor. 
Falls can affect a person psychologically. They can make an individual lose confidence in his or her ability to walk steadily; one of the very basic functions in life. The fear of falling will force him to minimize his need for walking, restricting the person to be bed bound for longer periods of time. This may in turn lead to other problems like depression, constipation and urinary incompetence. 
Falls have a negative social effect on the patients as well. The reluctance of the patient to step into the society for fear of falls would make him lose contact with his friends and family, causing him to feel cornered in the society. In addition, this can be frustrating for the caregiver of the person as well. Falls are known to widen the gap between the patient and the caregiver, making the caregivers job more difficult, remarked Dr. Samaraweera, concluding that falls could severely affect the quality of the life of an elderly person. 

Preventing falls
We asked the doctor what steps could be taken by caregivers to prevent falls in the elderly population. According to him, there is much that can be done. 
As we explained in last weeks article, falls could be caused due to factors relating to a patients physical and external environmental factors. While we can treat physical illnesses, a major part of preventing falls lie in modifying the environmental factors to suit the patients needs. 
This doctor advises against the use of smooth, slippery tiles on the floor because it increases the risk of a person having a fall. He recommends mat tiles or cement on the floor instead. The use of loose carpets on the floor or on a staircase may also lead to slipping and falling. Caution should be taken against objects like toys lying around which contributes to stumbling and falling. 
Minimal furnishing should be used in the persons room/surroundings and there must be plenty of space for the individual to maneuver. Low-lying furniture like low chairs-which might cause falling (even when sitting down)-should be avoided. Instead use safer chairs with armrests. The bed should be situated neither too low nor too high from the ground. 
Good lighting plays a major role in preventing falls. The light switch should be situated in a place where the person has easy access to; preferably near the bed. If there are steps or a staircase in the house, light needs to fall onto the steps in a way that the path is clearly visible. Too bright lights are best avoided, since the glare of the light may reduce visibility rather than improve it. 
Toilets should be easily accessible to a person who is exposed to the risk of falling and the floor should always be kept dry. Grab bars could be installed in order to minimize the risk of falling while using the washroom. Low toilet seats, including squatting pans, are best to be avoided when catering to the needs of the elderly. The doctor explained that an improvised high seat can be used, in place of using a squatting pan. 
A person at risk of falling should always wear steady, comfortable shoes which are neither too large, nor too small. The soles of the shoes should be resistant to slipping. Loose slippers should be avoided, according to Dr. Samaraweera. 
Walking aids would prevent falls, but also could be a causative factor for falls themselves when they are not chosen correctly, cautioned the doctor. The ideal walking stick varies from patient to patient, depending on the person and the disability. He recommends taking the advice of a physiotherapist or an occupational therapist, before choosing a walking stick. 
Elderly people who live alone and have no social support have a higher risk of falls, so help should be offered to them in a way that has a minimal affect on a persons independence. 

Message to caregivers
After a fall, its crucial to find out what caused the accident, in order to take measures to minimize a further occurrence. Much of the falls could be avoided by making the environment safer for the person, stressed Dr. Samaraweera. Also, counselling should be offered to a person who has experienced a fall beforehand and is afraid of falling again, in order to reassure them and assuage their worries. 

Message to senior citizens
While falls and the consequences can be devastating, the risk of falls could be greatly minimized by leading a healthy lifestyle, according to Dr. Samaraweera. He advised the older generation to have a nutritious diet rich in protein and calcium as well as to exercise regularly, all of which contributes to an active life. Changes in the diet of course can be started at a young age. This process called active healthy ageing would minimize the risk of falling as well as the consequences of a fall, concluded the doctor.

The great Pacific garbage patch
	
The Netherlands, (Daily Mail), 22 March 2018 -
The largest accumulation of ocean plastic in the world, known as the great Pacific garbage patch, is now three times the size of France, new research has found.
Aerial images reveal 79,000 tonnes of plastic in the huge ocean accumulation zone west of California, a figure 16 times higher than previous estimates.
The results suggest that there is far more plastic in the area than scientists thought, and that microplastics are rapidly accumulating in the region, researchers at the Ocean Cleanup Project found.
The tiny toxic particles get into our food supply when they are eaten by fish and can penetrate our internal organs and carry toxic chemicals into the body.
Study coauthor and Ocean Cleanup scientist Dr Laurent Lebreton told MailOnline: The great Pacific garbage patch (GPGP) is located half way between Hawaii and California. 
Plastic waste may decompose into small fragments, often referred as microplastics that may be harmful to marine life.

## Title: The young have given up, we have given up on them

The young have given up, we have given up on them
	
Around two or three years ago, the young of this country, disgusted at and disenchanted by what was and is happening around them, resolved on seeking greener pastures. Elsewhere. Abroad. Its a startling trend at one level, but one that was expected for a long, long time.
They have given up on the country that bred them, given up on the morals and polemics they were taught from an early age to respect, and while many of them are trying to strike at what they want in here, a great many others have yielded to their impulses and decided to complete their A Levels, get into a local university if possible, and once thats done, pack their bags and pursue their higher education, careers, and marriages elsewhere.
 
Consider the statistics. 4.5 million or 25% of this country is comprised of the young, i.e. those between the ages of 15 and 29 years. Ive had the good fortune of meeting so many of them during the last five or six years, particularly through stints at journalism and freelance writing, and Ive had the good fortune of discovering the hidden talents, the untapped potentials, of this demographic. No matter what fields they want to take to  from engineering to writing to photography to rapping to advertising  they are sincerely eager to get rid of the conventional wisdoms that exist in their societies and take the culture of their country to the next level. The elders have decided to rebel against these inclinations, but that has anyway been the case in other societies too. In Sri Lanka, however, a deeper problem exists: the absence of a proper leadership to represent them, and more to the point, to represent who they want to become.

And if this is the main reason for their decision to leave the country, they couldnt have picked a better time and yet a worse time: better because the country is in such a rut that the only way to escape it is to escape it literally, and worse because the world were in, and the countries these youngsters want to depart to, are being ridden by restriction after restriction, imposed as a result of what is considered to be the failures of multiculturalism and assimilation in those societies. We have moved, in other words, from Obamas America to America First and Brexit. The youth, in other words, have nowhere to turn to; unless they act and move fast, they wont be in a position to realise what they want. They have given up, but dont know where else to turn to.

A conundrum. 
In Sri Lanka, however, a deeper problem exists: the absence of a proper leadership to represent them, and more to the point, to represent who they want to become
Brain drains have always been a problem for Sri Lanka (just look at the minds from here at work, in big companies and organisations, elsewhere), and yet, even with that, this new impending spate of youth defections worries me more than anything else. In a context where those in charge of youth affairs are (for the lack of a better way of putting it) too old, too mellowed, to understand the affairs of the young, and in a context where the general polity of the country has splintered between two political camps, neither of which has any clue as to where they want to take us to, its understandable that the young have given up. (The ardently political among this demographic, naturally enough, still bat for the side theyre on, but the apolitical segment of that demographic, who despise politics in general but love the culture theyve been born to, hate both sides.) 
If 25% of this country leave in the future, when theyve picked up the skills and the habits they need to wade through the world, the brain drain they will compel will be quite unlike any other we have faced until now. Most of those who will leave, barring those who have no real future in terms of higher education (i.e. those who didnt study in local schools and hence have to go abroad to pursue what they want), would have picked those skills up courtesy of an education system that was free, or free in terms of the costs they didnt have to pay for and the bills that others footed for their schooling. It was the taxpayer who paid for their textbooks and teachers, the taxpayer who made them go through those 12 years from primary school to A Levels. Ultimately, all that money, all those costs, would have been for nothing: what they resulted in was a culture whereby those who learn to become professionals decide that enough is enough and pack their bags. If thats not a waste of money and resources, I dont know what is.
Brain drains have always been a problem for Sri Lanka (just look at the minds from here at work, in big companies and organisations, elsewhere), and yet, even with that, this new impending spate of youth defections worries me more than anything else

And I think its convenient for us to blame the politician, when the problem lies elsewhere. Personally speaking, I cant think of leaving my country, not because of some false consciousness of a non-existent superiority of this culture, but because theres no other society we can call our own. Worldly achievement and material success, however, are two big reasons why we are ready to become lotus-eaters. Theres something ironically contradictory about a country that can give so much  we are a nation of smilers despite the most obvious odds stacked against us  and yet force us to leave it because of those who lead it. If we dont fix this now, well never fix it. The young will leave us. For good and forever.

Vast re-organization of UNP by coming MayRuwan
	
The country would be able to witness a large-scale re-organization of the United National Party (UNP) before May this year, State Minister of Defense Ruwan Wijewardene said yesterday.
Mr. Wijewardene made this comment at a ceremony held to mark the 66th death anniversary of the late Prime Minister D S Senanayake in Colombo last evening.
The committee appointed to look into the reorganization of the party had recommended that a large-scale reorganization process was needed and Party Leader Ranil Wickremesinghe has given his blessing for this process to take place as soon as possible. Therefore, it was decided that these changes should take place by May this year, Mr. Wijewardene said.
He said the committee had recommended that the re-organization process begins from the grass-root level and the younger members of the party should be given this task. This he said is recommended in addition to the reshuffling of office bearers of the party.
Referring to the no-confidence motion against Prime Minister Wickremesinghe, Mr. Wijewardene said he was confident that it will not be successful. The joint opposition boasts that they have the support of 21 UNP MPs but they will not get even two UNPers supporting their cause, he said while highlighting the fact that the UNP Parliamentary group and other MPs who represent the United National Front (UNF) had pledged their fullest support to Mr. Wickremesinghe.
He said the JVP and the TNA would also think of the country when deciding on whether to support the motion. (Yohan Perera)

Vehicle prices may go up by 9% due to exchange rate hike: VIASL
	
The prices of imported vehicles were likely to increase by at least 9 percent because of the increase in the exchange rate of Japanese Yen, Sterling Pound, Australian and US dollars, Vehicle Importers Association of Sri Lanka (VIASL) said today.
Speaking to the Daily Mirror VIASL Chairman Ranjan Peiris said the selling rate of a Japanese Yen had increased up to Rs.1.50 from Rs.1.37.
Small vehicles such as Suzuki Wagon R and Toyota Vitz will be increased by Rs. 250,000. This will only be applicable for future vehicle imports, he said.
At the 2017/18 Budget proposals, import duties were slashed to 8 percent from 12 percent for some motor vehicles, including those are less than 1000cc.
Therefore, the VIASL requests people to buy from existing vehicle stocks before the price increase, Mr. Peiris said. (Chaturanga Samarawickrama)

Visa to make all local cards payWave-enabled from October
	
Every new Visa card issued in Sri Lanka from October this year will be payWave-enabled, Visas Asia Pacific Head of Risk Joe Cunningham told Mirror Business yesterday.
In an interview after the Joint Payment Card Industry Association of Sri Lanka (PCIASL) and Visa Conference in Colombo, Cunningham discussed Visas two key developments in Sri Lankaits move to gradually replace all existing Visa cards with payWave-enabled ones over the next 3 years and the growth of e-commerce in Sri Lanka.
The economic impacts of e-commerce are dramatic, Cunningham said.
E-commerce is an amazing opportunity for Sri Lankan merchants to grow their businessesinstead of having a market limited to the population of 22 million, theyll be opening up their market to the entire population of active consumers on the web."
Cunningham also emphasised that Visas focus on security and risk management was essential to responsible innovation.
He said the company was introducing new technology to improve the security of the e-commerce system, while also focusing on ensuring cardholders were vigilant when using their cards online while being able to maintain a lot of trust and confidence in the payment system.
He also pointed out that merchants too needed to think about the types of tools they use to protect themselves.
Risk Management is about protecting the ecosystem of Visa. We have a network of 3.2 billion Visa cards in circulation around the world, 44 million merchants and 17,000 banks in between, Cunningham said.
We have a huge obligation to protect the security and integrity of that network.
Cunningham underscored that global security standards were key to maintaining an internationally secure payment system and Sri Lankas integration into this system would be essential to continuing and enhancing security worldwide. (Tilini Rajapaksa)

When the uneducated are.... Nourished on a diet of myths and infertility pills
	
New Cassim Hotel on D.S. Senanayake Street in Ampara town

Do not go upon what has been acquired by repeated hearing; nor upon tradition; nor upon rumour; nor upon what is in a scripture; nor upon surmise; nor upon an axiom; nor upon specious reasoning; nor upon a bias towards a notion that has been pondered over; nor upon anothers seeming ability; nor upon the consideration.
-Gautama Buddha (Kalama Sutta)The Buddhas Charter of Free Inquiry

A group of doctors recently broached the topic and ruled out the existence of such infertility pills anywhere in the world
General public doesnt think logically about certain topics such as the infertility pill scare due tolack of scientific literacy
Since the scare regarding the infertility pill stared spreading many myths associated with infertility have been floating around
Education is not being used for a larger purpose in this country other than passing exams and finding employment
UNFPA stresses the need to ensure increased access to accurate reproductive health information


Life in Kandy and Ampara Districts has returned to normalcy now. The country is at present experiencing calm after a storm. The unrest in Ampara sparked with the speculation that a pill that causes infertility had been mixed with food served in New Cassim Hotel, a small scale local restaurant in Ampara town. The violence that followed, encouraged by deep-rooted racial bigotry, spread from Ampara to central Kandy, claiming two lives, leaving several injured and causing colossal damagesto property.
However, a debate on such medicine causing infertility raged as to whether there is any medicine prescribed either in Western or Ayurvedic Medicine to make a human being sterile. A group of doctors recently broached the topic and ruled out the existence of such infertility pills anywhere in the world. Officially setting aside the speculation that such a pill had been mixed with food in the hotel in Ampara, the Government Analysts Department confirmed that samples of particles found in food sold at the eatery did not contain sterilizing chemicals as alleged, but were mere clumps of flour. 
The people reacted to the speculation that was present. They were so judgmental without inquiring into what they heard, hence these incidents, which seriously questions the level of education that the general public possesses regarding reproduction and sexual matters.
 
I am receiving death threats
Ranga is a father of two and works at the National Water Supply and Drainage Board, Ampara. First, he was not willing to give interviews to any media agency claiming it would create more troubles for him. Later he was positively influenced by his friends to give his reasons because the cashier of New Cassim Hotel had already spoken to the media. They said that Ranga too should speak out, so that people can hear both sides of the story.

On February 26, Ranga dropped in at New Cassim Hotel for a meal. He wanted beef koththu. By that time, beef koththu was not available. Then, he wanted parotta with beef curry. He had said that he wanted to eat soon as he had just injected insulin for his diabetic condition. Ranga, who finished the first dish of beef curry, ordered another. Minutes later, he claimed that he had found a floating particle in the curry. 
Police provide protection to the vandalized mosque in Ampara
The particle I found in the curry resembled a yellow coloured piece of rubber. I questioned them regarding that particle. I did not want to commence a racial attack on the Muslim brothers. I am very disappointed that this incident spread violence in many parts of the country.
 
I am not a troublemaker. I have not engaged in any anti-social activity and not tarnished my good name in the village. After this pill incident, I have been receiving calls threatening me with death. I have two kids. My family is living in fear now, he said.

-Ranga 
Strangers are visiting my house under the guise of beggars. I have many Muslim friends. They maintain a very good relationship with me. I was compelled to raise the question regarding the dish because there was a particle. First, I had my doubts regarding the particle I found in the beef curry. However, another incident, which was not reported in the media, raised my eyebrows. Two of the hotel workers, including the brother of the cashier of the hotel (Farsith) ran away carrying two bowls containing the rest of the beef curry, served to me. That is when I made calls to my friends out there. If there wasnt anything to hide, why did they run away carrying the bowls which contained the beef curry he asked. 
According to Ranga, he had no involvement in the attack on New Cassim Hotel. 
Ranga said that he had followed the police jeep in his motorcycle to the police station with the intention of lodging a complaint. I was not at the scene when the hotel was burnt down. Yet, I was arrested with the charges of attacking the hotel, said Ranga.
Ranga was too quick to come to a conclusion
The cashier of the New Cassim Hotel, Ahamed Farsith still looked shocked and confused when we reached his residence in Irakkam, Ampara. Being a 28-year-old bachelor who is not even fluent in Sinhala, Farsith told theDailymirror that he is still afraid to go to the town alone.
 
First, I thought Ranga was pissed off after finding a piece of plastic or rubber in the curry. It was later that I was told that he suspected the piece to be an infertility pill, he said. 
Everyone told me that I appear in a video confessing to the crime of mixing infertility pills with the food. The video went viral on Facebook. I was blamed, shamed and heavily criticized over something that I had no involvement in. I have never heard of wandapethi or sterilization pills until the day the mobs descended on my restaurant, Farsith said.

-Ahamed Farsith




According to Farsith, Ranga who is a regular customer at his hotel, had come alone on that day and ordered Koththu Parotta with beef. 

Even after being told that Beef Koththu Parotta was not available at that time, Ranga had demanded beef curry claiming his blood sugar level had risen. He believed eating beef would increase the vitamin and mineral levels in his body and control the high sugar level in his body. 

When Ranga had finished eating the first beef curry dish the second beef dish arrived on the table. 

All of a sudden, he came to me, showed some particle claimed to have been found in the curry and asked me what it was. I said it should be a clump of flour. Ranga didnt appear to have accepted what I had said. When he repeated the same question in a different tone, I asked him to speak to the fellow worker in the hotel as my Sinhala is not good, Farsith recalled. 
Ranga, who did not pay heed to what he was told, made a few calls. Two other customers, who were having food in the hotel by the time this argument took place, also joined Ranga and started abusing Farsith. Within a short period of time, around twenty five men surrounded the hotel among whom was the person who video recorded Farsith acknowledging that he mixed infertility pills in the beef curry. 
Gate to the vandalized mosque
He began asking, dammadha, dammadha, Wanda Pethi dammadha (Did you put infertility pills). I was afraid of my life. There were dozens of men. I was compelled to say yes to whatever the men asked me, reminisced Farsith. 
Regulars to the hotel know that Farsith is not fluent in Sinhala. Farsith, however said that Ranga is not a trouble maker, adding that he often dines at the hotel accompanied by his wife and kids. Farsith believes that Ranga must have been under the influence of alcohol to act in that disturbing manner. 
As people flocked to the hotel, the police were alerted. The doors of the hotel were closed following the arrival of two policemen. Farsith and the cook were taken to the Ampara Police Station to record a statement. According to him, a few policemen had remained in front of the hotel to control if the situation got out of control. He claimed that the attack on his hotel must have happened in the presence of policemen who witnessed the attack unfold.
We didnt conceal findings of the report
Government Analyst A. Weliangage told theDailymirror that the particles found in the beef curry in New Cassim Hotel, Ampara were clumps of flour; contents of carbohydrates (starch). 
It was a small dough and not anything related to a drug. An analysis of the particles revealed that they comprised carbohydrates. We have sent a detailed report to the Ampara Magistrate and the DIG as there is an ongoing case related to this incident. Necessary actions will be taken by the authorities based on the report, he said.

-A. Weliangage

He rebuked an allegation leveled by certain parties that even if the Government Analyst Department found the particles in the curry to be particles relating to a drug, the Government would have instructed not to divulge it to the public because it alone can lead to more communal clashes. 
We are an independent department and take responsibility in the information we are expected to release to the public, he said.

Explanation of doctors regarding the never-heard miraculous pill
Unless someone is a medical professional, it can be difficult to tell which information about infertility is true. Even the readers wouldnt believe what is said. Since the scare regarding the infertility pill stared spreading many myths associated with infertility have been floating around. As a result the truth has become even murkier. Therefore, theDailymirror spoke to a doctor practicing Western Medicine. Dr. Upali Dissanayake was one of the medical professionals who came forward to make the general public aware of the truth regarding infertility pills. In order to obtain the findings in Ayurvedic Medicine regarding infertility, we also contacted another doctor Sujeewa Vithanage, who has practiced Ayurvedic Medicine for the past 18 years. 

Many of us know that fertility in males and females can be influenced by many factors. The continuous use of medicinal drugs containing heavy metals are only one factor which can potentially affect fertility. 

Infertility pill is a mere myth
Dr. Dissanayake stated that though the pharmaceutical industry has been searching for a medicinal drug which can cause temporary infertility, so that it can be used as a male contraceptive agent, similar to oral contraceptive tablets taken by women to prevent pregnancies, such a medicine has not been developed yet in any part of the world. 
The infertility pill is a mere myth. There is nothing to worry or be scared of regarding this myth, he said. 
The infertility pill is a mere myth. There is nothing to worry or be scared of regarding this myth
-Dr. Dissanayake

Male fertility depends on the presence of adequate numbers of active spermatozoa which are normal in structure and function in seminal fluid. When either the number of spermatozoa are reduced, or their function and mobility are impaired, the ability to impregnate a woman is reduced and this results in sub-fertility (difficulty in conceiving a child) and in extreme situations, infertility (the inability to conceive a child). Similar factors may affect the fertility of a woman, Dr. Dissanayake explained.
Fertility could be affected by continuous use of strong medication
Dr. Sujeewa Vithanage said that irregularities in the hormone system, having an autoimmune disorder (diseases such as lupus, diabetes, thyroid disease, and rheumatoid arthritis which can interfere with fertility), continuous use of medication, using tobacco or alcohol, being exposed to occupational or environmental hazards (prolonged exposure to high mental stress, high temperatures, chemicals, radiation, or heavy electromagnetic or microwave emissions) and having certain conditions or illnesses due to accidents may reduce fertility. 
There are instances where a mans or a womans fertility could be affected as a result of using adverse medication for a prolonged period of time. It is possible to make someone sterile, but only through continuous use of such strong medication, he said.

It was hilarious how the people believed that the Muslims had access to such a miraculous pill, as alleged
-Dr. Vithanage


He emphasized that there is no pill introduced so far to make a human being sterile forever. He said it was hilarious how the people believed that the Muslims had access to such a miraculous pill, as alleged. 

Wrong information used to ignite hatred
Meanwhile, the resident offices of the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations Population Fund in Sri Lanka (UNFPA) have dismissed this inaccurate information. 
Accordingly the two UN Resident Agencies, in a joint statement said they condemn such action in the strongest possible terms. 
In a statement UN Resident Coordinator and WHO Representative in Sri Lanka, Dr. Razia Pendse said, There is no medication or pills at present known or available that can permanently make a human being sterile. The information on use of an infertility pill or sterilization pill mixed with food is baseless with no scientific evidence. 

Adding wrong information on reproductive health is being used to ignite hatred and create tensions between ethnic communities
-Ritsu Nacken

In the meantime, UNFPA Representative in Sri Lanka, Ritsu Nacken, said the need to ensure increased access to accurate reproductive health information, especially among youth, is apparent.
Adding wrong information on reproductive health is being used to ignite hatred and create tensions between ethnic communities,Nacken said. 

Cultural factors limit open discussion of issues related to reproduction
There is definitely a lack of knowledge and public awareness about issues related to sex and reproduction, experts say. They claim that Sri Lanka does not have an organized programme to provide counselling and information to vulnerable groups. They believe that lack of human resources with necessary skills and experience on issues related to reproduction, cultural factors that have limited open discussion of issues, the lack of research on the topic and the needs of adolescents and youth have resulted the general public being exposed to scarce and false data and knowledge, not forgetting the weak political commitment for coherent policy initiatives. 
According to a study conducted by Institute for Health Policy (IHP), informal interviews revealed the importance of sex education in schools and the school was identified as the most appropriate place to educate children on Sexual and Reproductive Health. However, the study found that officials in the education sector did not have a clear idea on age appropriate education on reproduction and the current needs of adolescents.

Speaking on the matter, Dr. Upul Dissanayake said as far as he is concerned, the only place sex education is available in Sri Lanka is in medical schools. The national school syllabus in science includes sex education. The content is restricted to biological aspects of reproduction. 

In a misguided belief, possibly a majority of parents consider that non discussion of sex will keep their children safe from sex
-Dr. Dissanayake

However it is found that the teachers are reluctant to educate the children even what is there in the syllabus, Dr. Dissanayake said. Giving reasons, he said there is parental pressure not to discuss sex in school and there is the innate shyness on the teachers part to educate students on this topic.
 
In a misguided belief, possibly a majority of parents consider that non discussion of sex will keep their children safe from sex. The parents see their children as babies even when they grow up and there is reluctance to accept that with growth comes sexual inquisitiveness. I tell the parents to ask themselves whether the age old practice of non-disclosure kept them from knowing facts of life, he noted. 
Dr. Dissanayake emphasized that parents should not forget that when there is no credible source to satisfy their curiosity, children seek alternative ways such as from peers and elders- who have no proper knowledge, the internet and by using pornography. The result is lopsided knowledge and wrong information. 
He was of the view that there is hardly any focus on pedophilia, sexual abuse or unwanted pregnancies and how to prevent them. We have to acknowledge that these are problems in the society and shoving them under the carpet would not keep child safe from such hazards. As a result of this inadequate knowledge the population, even after leaving school, is easy prey for misinformation and myths, he warned. 
Sri Lankans fail to keep Home, School, and Temple apart
Former Head of Sociology Department of Colombo University, Professor Siri Hettige said the fertility pill issue is a tip of an iceberg. 
He was of the view that the general public doesnt think logically or analyze facts when it comes to certain topics such as the infertility pill scare due to lack of scientific literacy. 

Religion has replaced science in this country. 
There is no scientific literacy being imparted in the people of Sri Lanka

-Prof. Siri Hettige



This is a manifestation of a deeper problem in the society. This racial bigotry may come in any form. It once surfaced as issue with Halal. It will surface again in the future unless the issue is resolved, he said.

Prof. Hettige said scientific literacy of the general public in Sri Lanka is at a sorry state. The education system has been reduced to an instrumental activity. We have lost the substantive value of education. Education is not being used for a larger purpose in this country other than passing exams and finding employment. The most critical point regarding education is missing in Sri Lanka. Secular education should be established in Sri Lanka, said Prof. Hettige.

Religion has replaced science in this country. There is no scientific literacy being imparted in the people of Sri Lanka. Someone might have a PHD, but without basic and most important knowledge. This is because Sri Lankans have failed to keep the three places the home, the school and the temple apart, said Hettige.

He expected the spread of modern science in many parts of the world to drive secularisation  that science would be a secularising force. But that simply hasnt been the issue when it comes to Sri Lanka, he said. 
If we look at our society where religion remains vibrant, their key common features are less to do with science, and more to do with feelings. The story of science and secularisation becomes even more intriguing when we consider the Sri Lankan society that has witnessed significant incidents where people reacted to religion related matters, he stated. 
He queried whether many schools in Sri Lanka are free of religious influence Religion has a natural place in their homes and their children grow up with it. And thats fine. But does this not make it all the more important for schools to be free of religious influence Religions by nature always run the risk of creating an us against them scenario. However tolerant we are, there is always a reason people consider their own religions are superior to all others. This has to be changed. Otherwise, the country is heading towards anarchy, he stated.

Zuckerberg apologizes for Facebook mistakes
	
SAN FRANCISCO REUTERS March 21 
Facebook Inc Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg apologized on Wednesday for mistakes his company made in how it handled data belonging to 50 million of its users, and promised tougher steps to restrict developers access to such information. 
The worlds largest social media network is facing growing government scrutiny in Europe and the United States. This follows allegations by a whistleblower that British political consultancy Cambridge Analytica improperly accessed users information to build profiles on American voters that were later used to help elect U.S. President Donald Trump in 2016. 
This was a major breach of trust. Im really sorry this happened. We have a basic responsibility to protect peoples data, Zuckerberg told CNN, breaking a public silence since the scandal erupted at the weekend. 
He said the social network planned to conduct an investigation of thousands of apps that have used Facebooks platform, restrict developer access to data, and give members a tool that lets them disable access to their Facebook data more easily.
