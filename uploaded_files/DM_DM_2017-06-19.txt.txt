Britain hurtles into the Brexit unknown with a weakened leader
	

With her strategy unclear and her position insecure, Prime Minister Theresa May plunges this week into tortuous divorce talks with the European Union that will shape Britains prosperity and global influence for generations to come.
At one of the most important junctures for Europe and the West since the 1991 fall of the Soviet Union, Mays government is reeling from a crisis of her own making - the loss of her parliamentary majority in a June 8 snap election she did not need to call.
Such is the collapse of Mays authority that her entire Brexit strategy is being picked apart in public by her ministers, her lawmakers and her allies on the eve of formal negotiations which begin in Brussels on Monday at 0900 GMT.
Despite signals from both France and Germany last week that Britain would still be welcome to stay if it changed its mind, Brexit minister David Davis insisted on Sunday there would be no turning back.
As I head to Brussels to open official talks to leave the EU, there should be no doubt  we are leaving the European Union, said Davis, who will launch the talks with chief EU negotiator Michel Barnier.
Now, the hard work begins. We must secure a deal that works for all parts of the United Kingdom, and enables us to become a truly global Britain.
Britain has less than two years to negotiate the terms of the divorce and the outlines of the future relationship before it is due to leave in late March 2019. Both sides need an agreement to keep trade flowing between the worlds biggest trading bloc and the fifth largest global economy.
But the other 27 members of the EU combined have about five times the economic might of Britain. They also have a strong incentive to deny the UK a deal so attractive it might encourage others to follow the British example.
With May still hammering out the details of a post-election deal to stay in power with the support of a small Northern Irish party, there are fears of a disorderly exit that would weaken the West, imperil Britains $2.5 trillion economy and undermine Londons position as the only financial center to rival New York.

Profit after tax for the first quarter was Rs.42 million. The overall trend is encouraging and the bank is confident of consistently improving its performance in the coming quarters.
The quarterly profitability was mainly led by the significant increase in net interest income arising from key changes in the banks business and operational strategies.
Further, the fulfillment of the mandatory tier 1 capital requirement in the previous year enabled the Bank to achieve profitability within a shorter period of time. The gradual deployment of funds in higher interest bearing assets in the first three months has improved the core income of the bank.

The bank seeks to continuously extend its presence in the rural areas and expects to increase the customer base in the coming nine months period.
The non-funded income (net fee and commission income) recorded a growth of Rs. 20Mn for which income from trade and remittance services contributed with notable contributions.
Net gains from trading shows an increase of Rs. 3.2 million with foreign exchange gains being the main contributor. Other income of the bank increased by Rs.13 million due to revaluation gains recorded with respect to foreign currency investments.
The banks operating expenses has increased by Rs. 42 million due to expansion in its operational activities. The Banks cost to income ratio has decreased to 75.80 percent from 154 percent which reflects the outcome of improved performance. The NPA ratio declined to 0.70 percent from the previous years NPA ratio of 0.94 percent .The bank continuously focuses in improving and maintaining the asset quality.
The bank recorded a total asset growth of Rs.742 million for the period and the total asset base was Rs.22 billion while LAP stood at Rs.15 billion. Customer deposits grew by 7.28 percent for the period under review to reach Rs.10 billion by 31 March 2017.
There has also been a satisfactory increase in the banks customer base. As at March 2017 the bank had 15 branches in operation of which 6 are in-store branches. The bank plans rolling out six more in-store branches this financial year to enhance its growth momentum.

Conspiracy being hatched in Colombo to oust me: CV
	
Northern Province Chief Minister C.V. Vigneswaran said that there is a conspiracy being hatched in Colombo to remove him from office.
He had made this startling revelation when a group of supporters walked into his official residence and expressed their solidarity with the CM with regard to the no-faith motion brought against him.
He said, It is in Colombo that this conspiracy has been hatched. I do not like to reveal the persons behind it now. However, I will tell you how it happened.
He said the Council ministers knew that an investigation was going to be conducted into some of their activities.
I have to decide whether to take action against them or not after examining the facts mentioned in the report. Whatever action I take those conspiring against me will get their way. If I decide that no wrong has taken place, they plan to say that I am shielding the culprits, if I punish those responsible for the wrong-doings, then they will still try to kick me out saying that I am wrong to do so. Either way, I am doomed. They will have their way. It is our own people who said that an investigation should be conducted. That is the reason why we appointed a committee to investigate these allegations," he said. (By Romesh Madushanka)

Deadlock deepens
	
In the wake of the deadlock in the resolution of the crisis in the Northern Provincial Council, following Chief Minister C.V. Wigneswaran and the TNA leadership hardening their opposite positions, some foreign emissaries had sought a compromise on the matter, the Daily Mirror reliably learns.
Earlier, TNA leader R. Sampanthan wrote to the Chief Minister asking him not to pursue action against two Provincial Council Ministers as they were not found guilty.
However, it is learnt that Mr. Wigneswaran had replied seeking a written assurance from the two Ministers that they would not interfere with further inquiries.
As a result, it is learnt that the problem remains unresolved.
Meanwhile 15 members, mostly belonging to Mr. Sampanthan's faction in the ITAK, submitted a No-Confidence Motion against the Chief Minister, while another 15 have handed over a letter to the Governor pledging their allegiance to the Chief Minister.
It is learnt that some embassies and high commissions in Colombo had requested the TNA leadership to settle the matter amicably. (Kelum Bandara)

Dont push us to reveal what we know: Gammanpila
	
PHU General Secretary and MP Udaya Gammanpila today warned JHU General Secretary and Minister Patali Champika to stop making misleading statements on the BBS because otherwise he would be forced to reveal what he knew.
Responding to a question asked at a news conference, the former JHU member said BBS General Secretary Ven. Galagodaatte Gnanasara Thera was the former deputy national organiser of the JHU and the relationship between the BBS and JHU was not a secret.
I wont say whether the minister was behind Gnanasara Thera. Instead, I like to tell the minister not to slam the BBS and compel us to reveal what we know. After all, there should be a limit to making the minister uncomfortable. Therefore, I wont come into the middle of the dispute between the JHU and the BBS but I warn the minister not to spread misleading statements about the BBS and to push us to the point of publicly revealing what we know, he said.
He said he can comment whether Gnanasara Thera was handled by others with facts but that he wont go that far at this time.
The MP said there was a close relationship between the Thera and Minister even after the Thera joined the BBS.
In fact, JHU was the only political party which attended one of the conventions organised by the BBS. Minister Ranawaka was the only politician who attended the BBS Sangha Convention. JHU Co-President Ven. Hadigalle Wimalasara Thera was a key member of the BBS back then. These is public knowledge and I would comment only on these facts, he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Frances Macron is about to expand his power in a remarkable way
	
(c) 2017, The Washington Post   Jun 17, 2017 - PARIS - One is a female bullfighter. Another is an acclaimed mathematician who likes to dress like the Mad Hatter. Half are women, many are minorities and most are not career politicians. These are the candidates of En Marche (Onward), the party created a little more than a year ago by newly elected President Emmanuel Macron. It is now poised to sweep Sundays final round of parliamentary elections and fundamentally recast French political life.

French poll: Macron secures absolute majority
	
French President Emmanuel Macron clinched an absolute majority in parliament on Sunday night, the Telegraph UK reported.
However, it said the record abstention rates and a lower-than-expected landslide had prompted critics to warn Macron has no blank cheque for far-reaching reform.
In the latest chapter in his democratic revolution, exit polls showed Mr Macrons centrist party, La Rpublique en Marche, (Republic on the Move, or REM) - along with its centrist allies - was on course to win between 355 to 365 out of 577 seats in the lower house together with its centre-right MoDem ally.
Polls before the second round of the election predicted the count could be considerably higher.
But one survey suggested that 60 per cent of the French did not want the Macron majority to be too overbearing.
At 42 per cent, turnout was at a record low, an indication of voter fatigue after seven months of electoral campaigning  and also of anger with politics that could hamper Mr Macrons reform drive.
Edouard Philippe, Mr Macrons prime minister, said the result gave his party a clear majority. It will have one mission: to act for France. Through this vote, the vast majority of French have chosen hope over anger, confidence over turning in on themselves.
Meanwhile, the Socialists, who had a ruling majority under the previous administration of president Franois Hollande, suffered a crushing defeat, taking 41 to 49 seats.
Their historic losses triggered the resignation of leader Jean-Christophe Cambadlis, eliminated in round one in his Paris constituency.
Far-Left leader Jean-Luc Mlenchon won in Marseille and his France Unbowed party took between 26 and 30 seats, the polls predicted. The record abstention rate, he said, suggested that the French had entered a form of civil general strike.

Mahinda faction slinging mud at JHU: Champika
	
Jathika Hela Urumaya (JHU) General Secretary and Minister, Patali Champika Ranawaka said today the Mahinda Rajapaksa faction, which was dreaming of making Gotabaya Rajapaksa the leader of the country, were slinging mud at the JHU.
He said they were accusing the JHU of hiding Bodu Bala Sena (BBS) General Secretary Galagodaatte Gnanasara thera.
The minister said certain media institutions were supporting this mud-slinging campaign against them and recalled that it was mud-slinging by the media institutions which led to the defeat of former president Mahinda Rajapaksa.
He told a news conference that Mr. Rajapaksa should know the whereabouts of Gnanasara Thera if he telephoned the counsel who was appearing for the thera.
It is the same counsel who appeared for Mahinda Rajapaksa, Gotabaya Rajapaksa and Udaya Gammanpila, who is appearing for Gnanasara thera. He is a main orator of the Viyath Maga programme meant to bring Gotabaya to power. He may know the whereabouts of the Gnanasara thera, he said.
The minister rejected the allegations made by BBS CEO Dilantha Vithanage that he and Athuraliye Rathana thera had given contracts to Gnanasara thera and said the JHU had no connection with Gnanasara thera after the 2004 election.
We have no connection with Gnanasara thera. He supported Ranil Wickremesinghe in 2005, Sarath Fonseka in 2010 and Mahinda Rajapaksa in 2015. He did not carry out any contracts for us, he said.
He said there were no allegations against Gnanasara thera when he was working with the JHU and pointed out that the monk was in this situation only after he started working with NGO people like Dilantha Vithanage.
He said Muslims complain about their religious places of worship being attacked while Tamils and Sinhalese complain about their religious places being attacked.
It is the responsibility of the police to take action against those responsible. Law should be implemented against everyone irrespective of their status. If Muslims and Tamils were also making hate speeches they also should be punished. Acts of violence is taking place throughout the world including Germany, Britain and the US, the minister said.
He said a certain group which had links with global terrorism was operating in the country endangering democracy. (Ajith Siriwardana)

Man lynched for protesting photographing open defecation
	

Jaipur, (Hindustan Times), June 18, 2017 - Click a photo of people defecating in the open, and name and shame them. For the officials involved in the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, this is the simplest and the most effective way to make people give up the habit of reliving themselves in the open. The simple act, however, has not gone down well with those at the end.
A man who protested against civic officials clicking photographs of some women defecating in the open in Jaipur was brutally beaten up, resulting in his death.
The locals are angry at the death of Zafar Hussain. They are also angry at the approach that the officials have taken to deter them from defecating in the open. Its not a matter of choice for them, they say. The toilets were in bad shape earlier, and although they have been renovated recently, they are still unusable. When HT visited the community toilet, the centre painted bright yellow, all 10 were found far from being in usable condition.

New Standard  for plugs and sockets in Sri Lanka. Are you aware
	
Why Sri Lanka need standardization for Plugs and Sockets
Plugs in use
There are over 60 types of different plugs used in electrical equipment in Sri Lanka.
The three most common socket types used in Sri Lanka are 15A- Round Socket, 5A round Socket, 13A square socket.







To plug these different plug-tops to un-matching socket outlets people are addicted to unsafe practices as follows.
Non quality multi sockets (multi plugs)
	Non quality extensions
	Permanently blocking earth hole to keep gates open
	Inserting necked wires in to sockets
Due to these practices the people expose to more electric accidents and property damages due to fire.
New National standard introduced by the Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL)
Under new standards, only equipments with type G (13 A square), plug-tops and Sockets are permitted to import, produce or to sell.
With the standard its not necessary for people to use unsafe practices as above.Existing sockets and plug-tops of equipment at home
You do not have to replace the existing 5A or 15 A round pin sockets. If one day it happens to be replaced by an existing 5A socket, you should buy a square socket mentioned as 6A Max on the dolly. (You should not replace it with the 13A socket as wiring facilitates 5A socket)
Plugging, equipment with 5A plug to a 13A square plug or wise versa as multi plugs are banned.
With the new standard, 13A-5A and 5A-13A one to one converters are produced and released to the market.
How the standard effect on Extensions
Extensions must be with 13A sockets only with a fuse. Only such products are permitted to produce, import and sell.
Standard is already in action.
The import and manufacturing of non-standard items will be banned from 16th August 2017
	Selling of non-standard items will be banned from 16th August 2018

HINDUSTAN TIMES, 18th JUNE, 2017-Raging forest fires in central Portugal killed at least 62 people, most of whom burnt to death in their cars, and injured scores of others, the government said Sunday. Portugal declares 3 days of national mourning.
Nearly 600 firefighters and 160 vehicles were dispatched late Saturday to tackle the blaze, which broke out in the afternoon in the municipality of Pedrogao Grande, about 50 kilometres (30 miles) from Coimbra, before spreading fast across several fronts.
Unfortunately this seems to be the greatest tragedy we have seen in recent years in terms of forest fires, a visibly moved Prime Minister Antonio Costa said.
The number of fatalities could still rise, he said at the Civil Protection headquarters near Lisbon.
The priority now is to save those people who could still be in danger.

Special Parliamentary Session to mark 70th Anniversary
	
A special Parliamentary Session would be held on October 3 to mark the 70th Anniversary of Parliament, Speaker Karu Jayasuriya said on Saturday.
He said Speakers of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) would be invited to the occasion. He said senior politicians would also participate in the event.
It was a praiseworthy that we have been able to hold Parliament for seventy years despite many obstacles including the failed coup attempt in 1960, youth unrest in 1971, 1989 and the 30-year war, he said.
"It is important that we have been able to uphold democracy despite these obstacles," he said.
Speaking at a workshop for journalists covering Parliament, Mr. Jayasuriya said that the Sri Lankan Parliament had been brought to a respectable position today where even the Inter Parliament Union (IPU) President, said that Sri Lankan Parliament was a role model for other countries.
"We have trained about 70 young Parliamentarians throughout the world," he said.
He said a few Parliamentarians had acted indecently during the recent past to discredit Parliament and added that new Standing Orders and Code of Ethics for MPs that had been presented in Parliament would be taken for debate on the 22nd.
He said that according to the new Standing Orders, the Subject Minister should be there to answer oral questions asked by the MPs.
"Otherwise, it would be considered an insult to the particular MP and Parliament", he said. (Ajith Siriwardana)

Those who score 50 and complain of pains should go home: Minister
	
Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekera has said cricketers who score 50 runs and complain of leg pains should go home.
Most of our cricketers start doing exercises, after coming into a team. By that time the strength has been directed to another segment of the body. Our cricketers when they reach 50 runs, hold their legs and are unable to run. Earlier, a runner could be used.Now that too is prohibited. This is a good decision. If he cannot run after scoring 50, he should go home!" he said.
Minister Jayasekera has meanwhile decided that 23 sports in each district should be specially encouraged and 23 coaches should be assigned to do this job.
His main targets are the Olympics, Asian Games and Commonwealth Games, where these athletes will be able to rake in medals. Meanwhile if there are special coaches among them, they are to be sent abroad for special training.
Our athletics coaches are stuck in a mud hole. If Sri Lankas Chandika Haturusinghe as coach was able to bring the Bangladesh cricket team to its present status, there are obviously many more talented coaches among our ranks. Just because a player takes part in the Olympics, or is a member of a top notch cricket team, he cannot be rated as a top level coach. Just because a bowler takes 400 or 800 wickets, he cannot be judged as a leading coach.
Chaminda Vaas is a player who has taken 400 international wickets. I told him that if he aspired to be a coach, he should obtain training in coaching. Today he is training in various countries abroad because he has obtained that coaching. Just because someone wins a big medal, do not think he can be a top level coach!
The best example is Dav Whatmore. He has not even played 50 Tests. But today he is one of the best cricket coaches.We hope to obtain several foreign coaches in the future. In the past we have sent sprint and middle distance runners to Kenya for special training.
Then a Kenyan coach came to Sri Lanka to train our athletes. This coach said that Sri Lanka possesses extremely talented coaches. Today most of the coaches are a selfish lot.That is the main reason for the downfall in sports. There is no opportunity for young coaches to come forward. Present coaches train children without any education or knowledge of the game.
As a sportsman, I know that the methods used today are the ones used in the 60s. The stomach exercises that athletes do today belong to the 1975-1980 era. Our coaches are unaware of the changes that have taken place in exercises.
Most of our cricketers start doing exercises, after coming into a team. By that time the strength has been directed to another segment of the body. Our cricketers when they reach 50 runs, hold their legs and are unable to run. Earlier, a runner could be used.Now that too is prohibited. This is a good decision. If he cannot run after scoring 50, he should go home!
If a player is not fit or strong enough, there is no point in continuing in the sport. Most of our cricketers are pot bellied.This can be seen from the tee-shirts that they wear.There are no such ugly cricketers in any other country other than Sri Lanka. Only a few cricketers exists of perfect stature.
One player has said that just because you drop a catch, one does not lose a game. But I say that the dropped catches, lose matches. If the stomach is big the hand does not go to take the catch.Then the cricketer catches his head in dismay!
Take for instance the Bangladesh cricketers. None of them has a protruding stomach. This should be the style. I suggest that our players should undergo six months training in a Forces Camp, these comments were made by the Sports Minister at a Sports Science Diploma ceremony held at the Sports Ministry Auditorium. Over 600 sports instructors wer awarded diplomas at this ceremony.(Susil Premalal)
