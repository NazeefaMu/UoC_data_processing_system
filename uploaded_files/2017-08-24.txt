A book on a gentleman politician
	
RANIL WICKREMESINGHE?A POLITICAL BIOGRAPHY BY DINESH WEERAKKODY ?
Author has seen beneath his somewhat aloof personality-- the real person
	He explains the political heritage Wickremesinghe has inherited
	He has given priority to the next generation, not the next election
	Wickremesinghe remained unstintingly loyal to his party, the UNP
This book by Dinesh Weerakkody-who has many publications to his credit- traces the political journey of an extraordinary statesman. It should be of interest to all citizens of Sri Lanka, whether they are his supporters or not. The publication begins with his ancestry. Many have often wondered why a person coming from his back ground chose to enter the world of politics. This profession to some is a labyrinth which must be avoided at all costs.
Dr. Greg Power in his foreword advises everyone to read it in order to learn and understand the value of leadership, in making critical national choices and in using power wisely. Through the eyes and pen of a person, who has had a long and close relationship with his subject, it is certainly refreshing to get an insight into the personality of an often misunderstood statesman. This politician is none other than Ranil Wickremesinghe who has ?had the tenacity and endurance to stick to his belief in democracy and display incredible patience as the Leader of the Opposition. The author has seen beneath his somewhat aloof personality-- the real person-- who portrays dedication,discipline and a genuine concern for the people of this country and their woes. Ven. Galaboda Gnanissara Thero, who has known Wickremesinghe from his childhood, comments in the book that even as a child, the Premier never indulged in wrongdoings, malpractices or injustice. As a result he has emerged as a rare being in this country; a professional and a leader combined. ?
The author refers to Wickremesinghe?s love of history and comments that this perhaps stems from the fact his father, the late Esmond Wickremesinghe, obtained a first class Honours in history, from Ceylon University College. He explains the political heritage Wickremesinghe has inherited from the Wijewardene?s and the Jayewardene?s who were the movers and shakers of their time in Sri Lanka?s political history. He links Wickremesinghe?s political interest to Lake House which was begun by his Grandfather, the late D.R. Wijewardene.
The latter started the newspaper group with the objective of helping Sri Lanka obtain ?Independence. He states that among Wickremesinghe?s first dreams was the desire to be a journalist. He describes Wickremesinghe?s parents and their influence on him, his father?s dynamic personality and the closeness to leaders like Sir John and J.R. He was a powerful force, among those responsible in bringing the UNP back into power, under the leadership of the late Dudley Senanayake. Esmond Wickremesinghe was from a prominent Christian family and fought hard and long for press freedom. His mother Nalini, was a dignified, stately, beautiful, and devout Buddhist who was very close to her son. It was perhaps both these influences which combined in making Wickremesinghe a politician and a devout Buddhist. However, he also respects all religions and insists on the freedom of worship for one and all . ?
While speaking of his early childhood, his education, first was at the Kindergarten at Bishops College. Then he moved to Royal College and the friends he made there have remained as very close associates. The writer states that Wickremesinghe was always an avid reader. He was also very protective of his only sister, Kshanika. He was a good brother to all his male siblings.The author refers to Wickremesinghe?s grounding in law, after passing out as an advocate and while working in the chambers of two leading lawyers of the time-the late H.W. Jayewardene and Vernon Wijetunge. The author recalls ?the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune? in the premier?s political journey. He writes that Wickremesinghe remained unstintingly loyal to his party, the UNP.
He underscores Wickremesinghe?s patience and persistence while brickbats were thrown at him. While reading this book, one finds a new understanding of Wickremesinghe?s wide experiences as a statesman in good governance. There are also references to the many projects done by him for youth, education and industry during his tenure as Minister of these particular Ministries. The reader gets to know of the hard work done and the secret meetings held to ensure the victory of President Maithripala Sirisena. These were efforts taken to defeat the former Government which plunged the country into bankruptcy. It was a regime which was looked upon with disgust by all those in the democratic global world.
He writes about the dreams that Wickremesinghe had for Sri Lanka and the opportunity the premier received to make them realities. We also get to read about Wickremesinghe?s annexures in the book, by those who knew him well including the late Anura Bandaranaike, interviews with NDTV and N Ram in the Hindu and speeches by the Prime Minister at Business and other forums. The book is a good read for everyone and offers an example to younger politicians about the importance of learning to follow before one gets to lead. The book also highlights how Wickremesinghe learned to walk the straight path with unfailing loyalty to his former leaders and to the party. Wickremesinghe?s climb to the top is shown as a slow and steady one.
During this journey he has given priority to the next generation, not the next election. He has not made false promises to stay in power. The book pens a portrait of a gentleman politician, someone who can be termed a rare breed. As we read we figure how this politician used brain and not brawn to get where he is today. The author also stresses that Wickremesinghe must rise to the challenge and deliver before it?s?too late! ? ?

Bellanvila Viharaya A place for spiritual upliftment  and refuge
	
This year the annual historic Bellanvila Esala Perahera will take to the street for the 67th year during August. ?
This meritorious ceremony includes three days of Dhamma Desana sessions which draws devotees to the historic Bellanwila temple. Invoking of blessings starts with a week - long Pirith chanting. This is followed by the Deva Dootha Perahera, Dorakada Asna, Kumbal Perahera, Mal Perahera, Paawada Perahera, Ransivili Perahera, the final Randoli Perahera and the Diya Kapana Day Perehera and Deva Daanaya along with many?other ceremonies. ??
This perahera which started as a ceremony to invoke blessing on the people and their cattle in times of famine and epidemics in the Bellanvila area, has gradually grown into a month of religious and cultural celebrations. A concept introduced by the Late Ven. Bellanvila Somarathana Thero, this majestic street pageant has come a long way and today under the guidance of Ven. Dr. Bellanvila Dhammarathana Thero, the Chief Sanghanayaka of Singapore.?
The Temple also builds cost effective houses for the poor every year. This is an incredible service and support to those from low income families in the area
The incumbent Viharadhipathi of Bellanvila Temple Ven.Prof. Bellanvila Wimalarathana Anu Nayake Thera continues to be the chief architect of this?esteemed festival. ??
In this consumerist society, it is no secret that people deal with stress on a regular basis. A temple is a place that gives them the relief from all that. Particularly a temple such as the Bellanvila Maha Viharaya, which over the years have given the people the confidence to face life is a symbol of spiritual upliftment. In addition to that, the Bellanvila Temple provides many services to the community throughout the year. ?
Education
There are two Dhamma schools which function in the English and Sinhala media. In addition to giving support to schoolchildren who study Buddhism in both languages, it also enhances their knowledge of English. The Sri Somarathana Memorial Programme also provides scholarships to schoolgoing children from low income families. This is a huge relief to parents who struggle to find the means to pay for school materials. ?
Technical and vocation training
The Temple provides technical and industrial training to youth which includes lathe work and welding. These trainings along with English and Japanese language classes are offered free of charge to young people in the area. ? The Vocational Training Centre has been in existence for over 30 years. The number of students who enrol at the centre after Ordinary Level exams has increased over the years. The Centre continues to offer these opportunities and those who have enrolled are reaping benefits of the training. ?
Housing?
The Temple also builds cost effective houses for the poor every year. This is an incredible service and support to those from low income families in the area. ?
Health
The entire income from the car park goes into the health programme, especially to provide financial assistance to patients who undergo heart surgery. Approximately Rs. 50,000 is granted every month to many people. This service is continually done without any publicity. ?
The Temple also conducts health clinics where government doctors voluntarily come to serve. Lab tests are also done and this is an invaluable service to low income families. Especially, the cost of diagnostic tests are extremely expensive to get done and this clinic eases that burden. Going to a government hospital at 5 a.m is difficult especially for ailing and ageing patients.?
Hence this service is greatly appreciated, as it is a reach out programme for the needy. In addition to this, vision tests are also done and spectacles are donated during the?
eye clinic. ?
The Temple conducts health clinics and doctors voluntarily come to serve
Supporting other Temples
Every year the Nayaka Thera selects a temple in a distant location and supports in many ways. Beginning with an alms giving, essential utensils are gifted to these temples. Saffron robes are offered to the monks while books are also gifted among the children. Individual assistance is also granted to the priests. ?
Flood relief assistance
During the recent floods, the temple was instrumental in collecting dry rations for the affected people and distributing in collaboration with the Government. While many groups and media institutions sought publicity during this calamity, the Temple did a silent service of helping the flood and landslide victims. ?
Perahera?
Coming back to our main topic this month, it should be acknowledged that the Perahera is undoubtedly one of the most beautiful and colourful pageants in the country. The Perahera Committee also ensures opportunities to students of traditional dance to display their talents and most importantly includes dance forms of various parts of the country without any discrimination. Not only hill country dances, but also low country and Sabaragamu dances styles are included. The Perahera in Bellanwila is very unique in providing opportunities for men, women and children to take part. This is most significant as most Temple pageants disallow women from participating. Bellanwila Esala Perahera is indeed very inclusive in all aspects. ?
This is one event which goes beyond commercial norms of having exclusive sponsorships. Even traditional business rivals come together to sponsor the Bellanvila Perahera. Although there have been many changes in our society, the event as a whole, has protected religious and cultural traditions and passed it on from generation to generation. Also, not only Buddhists, but Hindus, Christians and those of Islamic faith support and in turn benefited from this week long event. It is a time for all to come together. It is also an opportunity for vendors to make significant profits during the perahera time. Pineapple, achchaaru and gram sellers can earn their monthly income during this period as large crowds gather to watch the perahera. ?
The Perahera will be shown live on a private TV channel and also on the website for international viewers from around the world. As the Perahera Committee hopes to promote this event with the Tourist Board from next year, a high influx of tourists who are expected to visit the Temple and the Perahera in the future. ? ?The Perahera will commence on August 20, and continue until the final Randoli Perahera on Saturday, August 26, 2017, culminating with the holding of the Day Perahera on the following day and will conclude with the Deva Dana. ?
The writer is the Secretary to the Bellanwila Esala Perahera?Organizing Committee ?

Cabinet paper now pushes Jumbos from pillar to post
	
Elephas Maximus Maximus or the Sri Lankan elephant in other words has a closer relationship with us Asians. As depicted in Hindu mythology, the much revered elephant-headed God, Ganesh, itself highlights the importance of this majestic being. Over the years we have been delighted to see elephants in pageants (peraheras), but not once have we thought of the troublesome experiences these majestic beings have to endure. As a result little do we know about how these animals have been exploited during various instances. ??
In a controversial turn of events, an unexpected overcrowding of elephants at the Pinnawala Elephant Orphanage has prompted the Government to giveaway elephants to private individuals and institutions. Following this, a cabinet paper too was dispatched to release 33 cubs back to their owners. These cubs had been illegally captured from the wild. The Daily Mirror spoke to several individuals of varied expertise in the field of wildlife, thus shedding light on the darker side of this issue.?
Highlights of the cabinet paper
Recently a cabinet paper was issued with a request being made to give away elephants cared for at the Pinnawala Elephants Orphanage and National Zoological Gardens. ??
The highlights of the paper are: ??
Elephants from the Pinnawala Orphanage were used as the ?stock of elephants? to be presented as ?State gifts to other countries? and to religious institutions and individuals in the country by the ?Head of the State?. ??
	However, the maintenance of the present number of elephants (88) in a restricted land area of 27 hectares has become a difficult task. ??
	The temperament of individual animals vary, when male animals come in to ?musth? their maintenance and attention become difficult as numbers increase. ??
	Further, the global campaign to house captive animals without chains (chainless animal populations) is effecting the tourist visitation negatively and the image of Pinnawala is also being tarnished. ??
	Considering these factors it has become very clear that some animals will have to be given out to ensure that the captive population is maintained within the ?carrying capacity? of the facility. ??
The request therefore was to give away elephants with a ?non-refundable financial bond? of Rs. 10 million. However the cabinet paper also states the following; ?The animals are NOT sold to individuals or institutions as elephants in accordance to the Fauna and Flora Protection Ordinance amended in 2009, Section 22A (12) are ?deemed to be public property?. Thus they are given to be cared ?for and on behalf of the State?. ??
?I dispute the fact that Pinnawala is overcrowded?
-Dr.Sumith Pilapitiya
Speaking to the Daily Mirror, Environmental Specialist and Ex-Wildlife Chief, Dr Sumith Pilapitiya said that the Government has released a cabinet paper requesting the release of elephants due to overcrowding in Pinnawala. ?This too is for a sum of Rs. 10 million. I would dispute the fact that Pinnawala is overcrowded and if overcrowding is the problem, there is a land adjoining the Pinnawala Elephant Orphanage which could be used as well. If not, some elephants could be sent to the Ridiyagama Safari Park because that too comes under the Zoological Department. The ownership and custody of these elephants should remain with the Government. Why do private individuals or institutions need to own elephants? There?s nothing called a domesticated elephant. Unlike cats and dogs, that are bred to be domesticated, elephants can?t be domesticated. These private owners are trying to own elephants as a status symbol. Elephants are very social animals,? said Dr.Pilapitiya who has spent a number of years researching on this?majestic being. ??
?So once they are taken out of Pinnawala, they will have no social interaction because that elephant is now alone. Pinnawala has one of the best elephant breeding programmes and breeding can?t happen just because there?s a male and a female elephant. They need to have space for interaction as well. We need to think of what is best for the elephant. It?s time that we look at this situation in Sri Lanka in a more realistic way. Take the pageant for example. We didn?t have elephants at these processions till the rise of the Kandyan Kingdom. Therefore the Government should seriously think why temple processions need elephants. Today we see elephants in even small pageants done for a ?katina? (A religious ceremony) as well. Hence the Government has the added task of legally catering to this demand. Elephants in pageants are not a religious requirement because Lord Buddha never said that there should be elephants in a pageant. Therefore the Minister and the relevant authorities should look at this issue in a more practical manner. Now it?s time that these measures are implemented,? Dr.Pilapitiya said. ?
?Giving ownership of elephants to private individuals reflects badly on the law??
- Jagath Gunawardena
?The entire decision is wrong,? said Jagath Gunawardena, environmental lawyer and wildlife enthusiast. ?Their intention is to give these elephants back to illegal owners and these actions reflect badly on the law. Elephants are public property and once these elephants are handed over to owners, nobody will abide by the law. Hence it?s giving a wrong message to the country. I also don?t believe that Pinnawala is overcrowded because there are no facts or statistics to prove it. If that is the case, then why can?t they send these elephants elsewhere??questioned Gunawardena.?
?Individual owners will ?not ?have 100% ownership?
- Gamini Jayawickrama Perera
Wildlife and Sustainable Development Minister, Gamini Jayawickrama Perera said that since two Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOS) have filed cases with regard to this issue, the decision is still pending. ?Although the cabinet paper says Rs. 10 million, it is a rough estimate.?
However, the individual owners won?t have 100% ownership of the elephant. They have to sign a deed and officially take the ownership of the elephant ?and if we find out that the elephant ?is being ill-treated we have the authority to take it ?back,? ?said Perera.
?Elephants are public property??
-Rukshan Jayawardene
Airing his views to the Daily Mirror, Wildlife and Nature Protection Society (WNPS) President and wildlife enthusiast Rukshan Jayawardene said that as much as elephants are protected under the Flora and Fauna Protection Ordinance, they also become public property at times. ?Private individuals need elephants because it?s a prestige symbol. Elephants are living sentient beings, but unfortunately, protection is limited to the statute books. Also what is overpopulation? If there are more leopards, bears and elephants we need to protect them because they are our natural resources. Why should they be given to private owners? Can we be sure that the elephant will be treated well? Once the elephant is in the custody of a private owner, there?s a high tendency of it being smuggled as well. If these individuals could pay Rs. 10 million for an elephant, how many more bucks would they need to keep the Department of Wildlife Conservation (DWC) and other authorities away? This is more like a mafia because these people still have connections with those who are in power and those who were. Back in the day elephants were trained to build tanks and other massive structures, but at this day and age of industrialisation we don?t need elephants for these purposes and therefore they shouldn?t be kept in captivity. So this is a wake-up call for the Government. Hope this issue doesn?t fall on deaf ears,?said Jayawardene.
The plight of Elephas Maximus Maximus
In an investigative video released a couple of weeks ago by LT Magazine - a Sri Lankan magazine that highlights matters of human interest- revealed the plight of the Sri Lankan elephant. A team of wildlife enthusiasts including Dr.Sumith Pilapitiya, Rukshan Jayawardene, Dr.Prithiviraj Fernando ? Chairman, Centre for Conservation and Research, Dr. Eric Wickramanayake, Chair and Science Advisor, Environmental Foundation Limited (EFL) and OtaraGunawardena, Founder of Otara Foundation pooled in their concerns. Some of the highlights of these concerns are: ??
The Human Elephant Conflict is a human created problem because most HEC mitigation methods are confrontational and leads to more aggression of elephants towards people. ??
	Reckless driving of safari-goers. ??
	?Salaries of DWC officers aren?t enough and they work 24 hours. I need more people,? says subject minister. ??
	Other Ministries create problems and expect this ?poor? Government department to solve the issues. ??
	Udawalawe National Park, once an elephant sanctuary, doesn?t seem to be one anymore. The video further highlights how the elephants are trapped in due to fencing and are starving to death. ??
	As a result cattle have encroached on this land and are feeding on the grass. According to the Minister, once cattle feed on grass the entire plant is removed. Therefore the grass has to be regenerated again and for that the cattle have to be removed first. ??
	Elephants in the wild are given a low value and that is why people think that they are better off being captured for our own purposes. ??
	Dr.Sumith further states that if an elephant is used in a Buddhist or other religious procession, then the elephant has to be taken care of compassionately and the elephant?s welfare has to be taken in to consideration. ??
	Ven. Pahiyangala Ananda Sagara Thera emphasizes on how elephants suffer due to ill-treated by mahouts. ??
	Orphaned elephants that came in to the custody of the DWC were sent to the Zoological Department which opened up an elephant orphanage to release them back in to the wild, but that never happened. ??
	Elephants in Sri Lanka undergo Dominance-based training, where people get their tasks done through coercive means. ??
	Trading elephants is illegal in Sri Lanka. ??

The Daily Mirror also learns that a request has been made to release 16 elephants provided that permit holders place a guarantee worth Rs. 10 million. The request is valid till September 20. However, attorney-at-law Sujeewa Jayasinghe further said that elephants with permit numbers 203, 209 and 231 will not be released.

Female torso is reporter missing from submarine
	
DPA, 23rd AUGUST, 2017- Human remains found in waters off the coast of Copenhagen are those of missing Swedish reporter Kim Wall, Danish police confirmed on Wednesday.
DNA tests showed that the torso of a woman found on Monday was a match with Wall, Copenhagen police said on Twitter.
Wall, 30, was last seen on the evening of August 10 on the amateur-built Danish submarine belonging to Peter Madsen as it left Copenhagen harbour.
Jens Moller Jensen of the Copenhagen police, who is leading the probe, said Tuesday the limbs and head were ?deliberately cut off.?
Copenhagen police said a news conference was scheduled for 9am (0700 GMT) on Wednesday where more details would be provided.
Madsen has said she died after an ?accident? on board.
Madsen, owner and designer of the 18-metre submarine, is suspected of manslaughter in connection with Wall?s disappearance. Madsen was remanded in pre-trial detention on August 12 at a closed door hearing.
Wall, a freelancer, was reportedly writing an article on Madsen at the time of her disappearance.
?Madsen is also known for designing rockets, a hobby that earned him the nickname ?Rocket Madsen? in Danish media. A large search operation has continued near the location where the remains were spotted Monday, including divers and on the shoreline.

For Clarence Wijewardena; Soaking it all in
	
Young people revel in being philistines not because their mothers and fathers and aunts and uncles don?t understand them (to be sure, they don?t), but because they want to show that they care, that they understand what their elders want them to.?
?
Some of the greatest art was born out of that kind of philistinism. And some of that philistine art has survived widespread censure. But the philistinism of the past was conditioned by an important fact. That fact was, simply, that young people knew what they were up against and had an underlying motive to please?and to enthral. ??
The young of today are complacent, smug, passionate, and to an extent they at least try to please us. But the art they churn out can hardly be called art. They have the talent and the raw craftsmanship but they don?t have what it takes to convert that into something meaningful, something artistically fulfilling. When was the last time we heard a song which didn?t croon about love, be it imagined, lost, regained, lost again, or lost forever? When was the last time we saw a film which thrived without those Antonioni-inspired profundities that are so symbolically banal that when they actually didn?t mean anything, they are interpreted to mean something? ??
The problem with these cultural revolutionists is that they try to transform their common experiences into works of art they think we?ll take to. (For the record, of course, we don?t.) They feel so strongly that their experiences are enough, that their sense of daring will magically do the rest of the work. Depending on how you view it, this can be a sign of their laziness or convictions, and if it is the latter, those convictions of theirs aren?t really enough to convince us. Now my point here is that for any art to prosper, in any society, and for the popular to cohabit with the arty, the performer must be aware of and alive to his society. That?s what enriched our purveyors of pop culture: the H. D. Premaratne of Sikuruliya and Apeksha and the man who composed the music for both those movies, Clarence Wijewardena. ??
The two most discernible and easily identifiable points about a Clarence Wijewardena composition are that, one, it tells a story or at least has a story behind it, and two, it empowered a particular social milieu, middle class and demarcated as the Petit bourgeoisie. Ajith Samaranayake in a tribute to Camillus Perera surmised that this bourgeoisie (or lumpen proletariat) had evolved into a special subclass on their own terms. It was that subclass which provided grist to Clarence?s work, which sought to bring together the sarala gee tradition of Amaradeva and the baila-calypso tradition of Wally Bastian, Desmond Kelly, Neville Fernando, and C. T. Fernando. ??
Clarence spoke or rather wrote and made others sing about the foibles of ordinary individuals, the Mangos and the Kalu Maamas who found life so mundane that they just had to make it interesting, if not colourful. This was reflected in even the instruments that the Moonstones, his first band, operated on: like the Beatles, they included the sitar alongside the guitar. Elsewhere Khemadasa was doing roughly the same thing, compounding the guitar and the piano with the sitar, the tabla, the violin. ??
Khemadasa took it upon himself to interpret Western chords and melodies to a discerning local audience. But that discerning audience was also discriminating, and belonged to the crowd which was fixated on the classically romantic. Clarence was not a romantic in any classical sense: his task was to refine, to readapt, and to interpret a form of music (baila and calypso) which had been disparaged by the same milieu that produced it. In doing that he wasn?t limited by the parameters of that genre, of course: neither the 6/8 beat that baila thrived on nor the deft interplay of words reflected in its lyrics. Added to this was another point, as important, as relevant. ??
The ?low key? pop quality of much of Clarence?s work (regardless of whether they were written by him) was not really low key the way baila was. As I noted in my tribute to Anton Jones, baila lyrics celebrated a certain kind of freedom that subsisted on a happy-go-lucky, careless lifestyle. In ?Mama Enne Dubayi Rate Indala? M. S. Fernando epitomises this attitude of carelessness rather well. You don?t come across that freewheeling carelessness in Clarence?s work, if at all because while they celebrated a freewheeling lifestyle, that didn?t thrive on a self-indulgent ethic. ??
His most suggestive, if not provocative, songs ? like Mungo Kalu Nande and Mame Kalu Mame ? only hint at such an ethic. In this he was probably reflecting the milieu of those who doted on these songs, tempered by a middle class world-view, conservative, at times even puritanical, yet aspiring for more than what they had. They were not the kind of people that moralists would have deplored, but the kind that hinged uncomfortably on such a milieu. Ignored and neglected by nearly every artiste here, they would eventually become Clarence?s biggest audience. That almost all of them hailed from the same locales which nurtured baila ? Moratuwa, Negombo, Chilaw ? was to be expected. They were overtly enraptured by baila, yet covertly disdainful of its celebration of self-indulgence; consequently, they were relieved at a man who reconciled the best elements of that genre with the qualities which they, as a collective, embodied. I fervently believe that was Clarence?s biggest strength. ??
It?s a curious interplay of love and hate, of sarcasm and infatuation, which are to be found in many of his songs. But while his early work celebrated this at times contradictory fusion of opposites, his later work, in the seventies and eighties, sought to do away with it. Like most artistes who mellowed, matured, and grew wiser with the years, Clarence seemed here to have wanted to assert life as it was, without that streak of self-indulgence. To me, this is what explains the eventide quality of his later work ? Atha Ran Wiman, Piyamba Yanawa Ma Akasaye, Sihina Lovak Dutuwa Mathakayi ? eventide because when you listen to them, you feel as though they were composed just so to be sung at twilight, at dusk, when you look back on the day which went by and wanted to be happy at the fact that you achieved something, anything, in that day. ??
Clarence spoke or rather wrote and made others sing about the foibles of ordinary individuals?
In the end he took an entire career to celebrate what we, his greatest admirers, had been celebrating every day. He became alive to that eventide welter of life, in which all our sorrows and defeats and conquests congealed into a dusk which we all went to, forgetting enmities and realising that we were all in it, to win or to?lose, together. ??
In short, the composer got us to look forward to another tomorrow by closing in on today, when earlier he got us to remain transfixed on a seemingly eternal today. ??
And in the end, his work, his songs, kept us alive not just to today and tomorrow, but to yesterday. The same yesterday he adorned and yes, resurrected. For us. ??

GL goes to SC over draft 20A
	
Joint Opposition stalwart Prof. G. L. Peiris today filed a petition at the Supreme Court against the draft 20th Amendment to the Constitution.
Prof. Peiris told a news conference that the government should go for a referendum even though the draft 20th Amendment to the Constitution would get approved in Parliament with a two-thirds majority.
?The government is coming up with baseless reasoning to justify this Amendment. They are claiming that this Amendment would be in favour of the people and it is for their well-being. All these claims are false, this Amendment is a fraud,? he added.
He said that the true reason behind the Draft 20th Amendment to the Constitution was to postpone all the elections, even though the government had claimed that they were in need to hold Provincial Council elections in one day.
He said that according to the Constitution, it was mandatory to hold the three Provincial Council elections before the end of 2017. He also said that it was necessary to hold the elections at the accurate time in order to stand with the universal franchise.
?The government is also in an attempt to delay the Presidential Elections by claiming that it is necessary to hold Presidential and Parliamentary elections in the same day. It is impossible to delay the Presidential election and we will not let it happen. The next Presidential election will have to be held at the end of 2019,? he added.
He said that several Joint Opposition?s front-liners would file petitions against the draft 20th Amendment to the Constitution in coming days.? (By Kalathma Jayawardhane)

HNB Assurance 2Q net profit soars on higher premiums, investment income
	
HNB Assurance PLC?s (HNBA) profits received a boost during its most recent quarter from a strong growth in premiums amid challenging operating conditions, while the investment incomes also grew as the company added more money to its financial investments, the interim financial accounts showed.?
HNBA, a unit of Hatton National Bank PLC, reported a net profit of Rs.102.1 million or Rs.2.04 a share for the April ? June quarter (2Q17) from just Rs.7.3 million or 15 cents a share during the corresponding period in 2016.?
HNB Assurance group, which also has a general insurance subsidiary, increased its consolidated gross written premiums (GWP) by as much as 25 percent year-on-year (YoY) to Rs.1.9 billion.?
HNB Assurance is one of the fastest growing insurers in Sri Lanka and the company had to segregate its business as life and non-life (general) from January 1, 2015 under the regulator?s call to split the composite insurance business.
As a result, the company established a fully owned subsidiary called HNB General Insurance Limited to carry out its non-life business.
The quarter under review saw the general insurance GWPs growing by 36 percent YoY to Rs.971.5 million and during the six months ended in June 30, 2017 (1H17), the premiums grew by 27 percent YoY to Rs.1.9 billion.?
Meanwhile, the life premiums for the quarter grew by 16 percent YoY to Rs.925.8 million and the 1H17 the growth was 17 percent YoY to Rs.1.9 billion.?
By the end of June 30, 2017, the company had a general insurance liability of Rs.2.5 billion, up 29 percent and a much bigger life fund of just under Rs.10 billion, up 14 percent YoY.
Meanwhile, the company grew its investment and dividend income by a strong 35 percent YoY to Rs.383.1 million during the 2Q17.?
While this is predominantly due to the Rs.1.8 billion increase in the financial investments during the 1H17, the yield of the investment portfolio would have also been higher than the previous year due to higher government securities yields.?
The group has a total financial investment portfolio of Rs.13.4 billion. ?
The company paid Rs.519.4 million for the quarter as net benefits and claims, an increase just five percent YoY.
Meanwhile, for the 1H17, HNB Assurance reported a net profit of Rs.176.2 million or Rs.3.52 a share from Rs.32.7 million or 82 cents a share reported for the same period.?
The consolidated GWPs rose by 22 percent YoYto Rs.3.8 billion almost equally shared between life and non-life businesses.?
During the period, the company paid a total net benefits and claims of little over a billion rupees, up 12 YoY.
As of June 30, 2017, Hatton National Bank PLC held 59.99 percent stake in the company.

Hyderabad kidney racket: Police yet to grill Lankan doctor
	
Sleuths of the Hyderabad Central Crime Station are yet to interrogate the Sri Lankan nephrologist Doctor, who was accused of doing 58 kidney transplantations with paid donors coming from Hyderabad, Nalgonda and Guntur districts, and other parts of India.
In India, donors have to be related to the patient they are donating the kidney to in order to stop poor people from selling their kidneys for money and endangering their own health. The case has been pending from 2014 and is still under investigation. A chargesheet has yet to be filed.
The CCS recently sent yet another clarification to the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) regarding the Letter Rogatory for recording Doctor?s statement in Sri Lanka.
CCS Cyber Crime Assistant Commi-ssioner of Police KCS Raghuveer, who is the supervising officer of the investigation, said that the Letter Rogatory (communication between the court of one country with the court of another country) issued by the Hyderabad court has to be sent to the Sri Lankan court after the MHA authorises it, but the latter is still pending.
?The MHA has asked clarification on it two or three times and we have sent them replies. We are expecting MHA to issue authorisation at any point of time and then we will send a team to Sri Lanka and record the statement. In Sri Lanka, kidney transplantation of unrelated donors is legal. So we can only make him a witness, though he is named as accused number 10 in the case. After recording his statement, we will file the chargesheet,? Mr Raghuveer said.
The case was booked under the IT Act and the Transplantation of Human Organs Act, based on a complaint lodged by one Ganesh Kumar Maroo.
His relative, Dinesh Kumar Maroo, died in Sri Lanka, where he had gone in order to sell his kidney.
Police say there were 58 ?donors? and each was paid Rs 5 lakh, though they were promised Rs 30 lakh each. The remaining amount went as commission to the accused.
CCS police have arrested three persons in the case so far. Others involved, including Suresh and Usha Saxena, who allegedly acted as conduits, are yet to be arrested.? (Deccan Chronicle)

?
North Korean leader Kim Jong Un ordered the production of more solid-fuel rocket engines and rocket warhead tips, the North?s official media said on Wednesday in a report otherwise lacking threats against Washington after weeks of heightened tension. ?
A report about Kim?s visit to a chemical institute came not long after U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson appeared to make a peace overture to Pyongyang, welcoming what he called the recent restraint shown by the reclusive North. ?
U.S. President Donald Trump also expressed cautious optimism about a possible improvement in relations with the North, after months of mounting tension over its weapons programs. ?
Kim was briefed about the process of manufacturing intercontinental ballistic missile warhead tips and solid-fuel rocket engines during his tour of the Chemical Material Institute of the Academy of Defence Science, the North?s official KCNA news agency said. ?
?He instructed the institute to produce more solid-fuel rocket engines and rocket warhead tips by further expanding engine production process and the production capacity of rocket warhead tips and engine jets by carbon/carbon compound material,? KCNA said. ?
North Korea has conducted two nuclear tests and dozens of missile tests since the start of last year, significantly raising tensions on the heavily militarized Korean peninsula. Two tests of intercontinental ballistic missiles in July resulted in a new round of tougher global sanctions. ?

No-faith motion against Rajitha handed over
	
A no-confidence motion signed by 39 Joint Opposition (JO) MPs against Health Minister and Cabinet Spokesman Rajitha Senaratne was handed over to Speaker a short while ago, MP Udaya Gammanpila said.
The motion which was signed by MPs including JO Leader Dinesh Gunawardane, Vasudeva Nanayakkara and Dullas Alahapperuma charged the minister had failed to fulfil his duties as the Health Minister, had solicited bribes during his tenure as the fisheries minister and influenced and threatened the Judiciary and the Attorney General?s Department.
The joint opposition alleged though a number of bribery complaints had been made against the minister, no action had been taken so far.
?This shows opportunities to implement justice had been obstructed. Also, the public opinion is as such that he is guilty for these allegations because he is evading investigations,? it said.
It said the minister had created chaos in Sri Lanka?s medical education by sacrificing it to the business community, by being biased towards the SAITM, misusing public funds to takeover the Neville Fernando Teaching Hospital and voluntarily ignoring to gazette minimum standards of the medical education which were set by the Sri Lanka Medical Council.
The JO said the Minister had failed to adequately respond to the Dengue epidemic and created a financial loss to the state by influencing to purchase a rejected medicinal drug for breast cancer. (By Lahiru Pothmulla)

Responding to a statement made by former Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe about his removal, Deputy Minister Ajith P. Perera said it was debatable as to if the former minister would have the temerity to remain in the post held by him if he had not been asked to resign.
In a press briefing the Power and Renewable Energy Deputy Minister said that in that case former Minister Rajapakshe could have resigned when the Cabinet, of which he was a part of, took a collective decision on the Hambantota Port.
?Or he could have resigned soon after a unanimous decision was passed in the United National Party (UNP) Working Committee,? he said.
Deputy Minister said that he doesn?t have any hard feeling with regards to Mr. Rajapakshe but what had happened to former minister was a result of him disregarding his responsibilities to see that justice was served, an election promise given to the people when the unity government was formed.
He also challenged Mr. Rajapakshe to come out with facts or evidence, if any, against any UNP member he was accusing of wrong-doings or keep mum.
While denying the charges of the former minister that he was removed because of the Central Bank Bond issue, the Deputy Minister said that the Presidential Commission of Inquiry (PCoI) will continue with its mandate and the former minister did not have any way to influence or delay the inquiry.
?Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe is not involved in the Bond issue. It was proved that Mr. Wickremesinghe had no connection to the Bond scam by what is in the COPE Report,? he said. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

The Government Medical Officers' Association (GMOA) today alleged that Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne was giving all assistance to Dr. Nevil Fernando to recruit 300 more students to the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) despite the government?s order to suspend student enrollments to SAITM.
GMOA media spokesman Dr. Samantha Ananda told the media that the government allocated Rs. 300 mn annually for the maintenance of SAITM.
?Despite our exposure that SAITM was not maintaining required standards, the government and specially Dr. Rajitha Senaratne is safeguarding this institute. We cannot fathom why the government is spending a lot of money on something which has no value,? he said.
He also said the SAITM issue had triggered plenty of other problems and thus it had tarnished the image of Sri Lanka and paved the way to create a dearth of professional doctors in the country.
Meanwhile, GMOA Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said as the government had turned a blind eye on that issue, a crucial discussion would be held with President Maithripala Sirisena tomorrow on the SAITM controversy.

Chief Opposition Whip Anura Kumara Dissanayake yesterday claimed that Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne had been granted Rs.10 million from the President?s Fund for the operation he underwent in Singapore while the common man needed to go through a long procedure and needed documentary proof to obtain even Rs.175,000 from the fund.
He drew the attention of parliament to the fact that private pharmacies and laboratories were mushrooming near government hospitals even though the health minister was claiming that medicines were being provided at government hospitals free of charge. "If these services are being provided free of charge to the public at government hospitals, why are private pharmacies and laboratories mushrooming near government hospitals? If the local health service is so good why did the health minister travel to Singapore for treatment? He should have had his operation done at the National Hospital isn't it?" he asked.
Moving an adjournment motion on the need to provide relief to people affected by the drought, Mr. Dissanayake said people in drought hit areas should be provided with a health service allowance as they were facing great difficulty in finding money for their health services.
"These people have lost their sources of income due to the prevailing drought. Most of these people are suffering from kidney diseases and need money to get medicine," he said.
MP Dissanayake also blamed Minister Senaratne for leasing out the Modara Fisheries Harbour for an amount less than the official estimate given by the State while also claiming that he was avoiding investigations being carried out against him by the Bribery Commission.
"The Bribery Commission has summoned him on two occasions to appear before it to inquire into the harbour tender but the minister had not gone there. Instead he influenced the President to remove the Director General of the Bribery Commission," Mr. Dissanayake alleged. (Ajith Siriwardana and Yohan Perera)

50th Annual Esala Festival of Seenigama Maha Devalaya
	
The 50th annual Esala Festival of Seenigama Devalaya in the Southern coastal belt commenced on July 25 at 10.05 am after planting kap. This sacred place was situated earlier on the mainland and today it is situated 300 metres away from the mainland in the sea due to severe sea erosion.?
Historical importance
The history of this Devalaya tutelary by Sri Devol Maha Devindu goes to a very long time to the past. It is before the arrival of Prince Vijaya. This period happened during the time of Gauthama Buddha. A group of Gods arrived at the Ferry of Seenigama and there was a lady in this ferry as a leader. She was a lady who protected the chastity and people paid their homage from those days. This is called one stage of Paththini Mani who was worshipped by the people from the time of King Gajaba. It is confirmed according to tales about Paththini Mani, there was a Devol Devalaya till the arrival of Prince Devol. ??
It is said that the Seenigama Paththini Devalaya is the oldest Devalaya in the Ruhunu area in Sri Lanka. It was very clear that it was called pure Seenigama by past poets. Devol god invaded the place of Paththini and it was the centre of the place where he spread his fame. There are people who believe that the Devol is coming from the generation of Ravana. ??
Miracles
Sri Vishnu, Kataragama and Dedimunda had come to Seenigama and had met the Paththini Devi and requested to permit Devol Sami to enter the island. But Paththini Mani thought of checking him as she had some fear about him. When the Devol Sami was near the beach and requested ?My sister, please permit me to enter?. Nevertheless, there was an elder sister to Devol in his previous birth and he was given the name of Devol by Sakdevindu. ??
The ancient books indicated that Paththini Devi went to Nawagamuwa for settlement with her golden anklet though she terrified Prince Devol by showing her power of chastity by stamping her right foot seven times and created seven volcanoes. Due to his previous merits, he could have averted them. ?
Sub-King Seraman suffered severe headaches and obtained relief by doing certain rituals for seven days called ?Paththini Kolmura? and even today it is used in this oblation. ??
?Seraman Rajahata ? Dama ginidel ledakota ?Kara kovilak mata ? dunnoth?hondavevi hanikata?
Pundit Wasudeva who took over the state after King Vijaya suffered an incurable disease. The blessing was given to him by King Malaya together with help of sages by chanting charms. Even today there is a ritual called ?Shanthi Poojava? in Devol Maha Perehera. ??
The Portuguese came to Sri Lanka in 1505 and destroyed all the temples in coastal areas and the Seenigama Devalaya also was destroyed by Suza, Navy Commander of Portuguese in 1580. Hiralu Sandeshaya written in 1912 by Ven Binnagoda Vichiththavaratissa Thera had been sent to the Seenigama Devalaya to protect the Buddha Sasanaya from disrobed persons. It aimed to punish the people who damaged the Bikkunisasana. ??
After that all the disrobed people were sterilized. ? In 1922 the Seenigama Devalaya was separated from the land and it was called the Devalaya in the sea due to the huge sea erosion.

UN rights experts urge US to ?unequivocally? condemn racist hate
	
GENEVA REUTERS Aug 23- U.N. human rights experts called on the United States and its leadership on Wednesday to ?unequivocally and unconditionally? condemn racist hate speech and crimes and to carry out investigations. ?
?The statement issued by the U.N. Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination (CERD) stopped short of criticising U.S. President Donald Trump by name. But it said CERD was ?disturbed by the failure at the highest political level of the United States of America to unequivocally reject and condemn the racist violent events and demonstrations?. ?
?Trump revved up supporters on Tuesday with a defence of his response to a white supremacist-organized rally in Virginia . ?We are alarmed by the racist demonstrations, with overtly racist slogans, chants and salutes by white nationalists, neo-Nazis, and the Ku Klux Klan, promoting white supremacy and inciting racial discrimination and hatred,? said Anastasia Crickley, who chairs the U.N. panel of 18 independent experts. ?
