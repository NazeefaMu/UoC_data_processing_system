Argentina and IMF agree on US$50b loan
	
?
DPA, 08th JUNE, 2018
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) and Argentinian authorities on Thursday reached an agreement on a 50-billion-dollar stand-by loan to help strengthen the South American country?s economy.? ?
The credit arrangement will be subject to approval by the IMF?s executive board, which will consider Argentina?s economic plan in the coming days, the IMF said in a statement.? ?
The loan is aimed at reducing the country?s deficit over the next three years.? ?
President Mauricio Macri?s government has pledged to speed up measures to reduce federal deficit and restore the primary balance by 2020.? ?
IMF chief Christine Lagarde welcomed the move, saying it ?will ultimately lessen the government financing needs, put public debt on a downward trajectory, and as President Macri has stated, relieve a burden from Argentina?s back.??
?
Macri announced in May that he would seek a loan from the IMF to help the country deal with the fall of the peso, which has lost around 20 per cent of its value against the dollar this year.??

Charge-sheet served on Ismail: Wijeyadasa
	
MP Seeni Mohammed Ismail, who was sworn in as an MP yesterday had been served a charge-sheet with regard to alleged corruptive deals during his tenure at Oluvil University as the Vice Chancellor, Minister of Higher Education Dr Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe told Parliament last morning.
Dr Rajapaksa said investigations were being carried out against the new MP by the University Grants Commission.
?This MP, who was Former Vice Chancellor of Oluvil University had used the University funds to maintain his house and to pay his utility bills,? the Minister said.
?I don?t have any issue with the political party this MP belongs to but only trying showing the reality, when it comes to this country?s higher education sector,? the Minister said.
Minister Rajapakshe said a mafia was taking running the University of Oluvil as students have to give sexual bribes to lecturers to ensure that they were successful in passing examinations.
?One lecturer had threatened a student saying that he would fail him if there was no sexual bribe,? the Minister added.
The Minister said there was a peculiar environment in universities as even Vice Chancellors and Deans were pressurised not to take action against those who were caught with ragging.
He said there had been 280 reported raging incidents during the recent times, which included sexual harassments.
Dr Rajapakshe said an app had been created to help students to inform the authorities, whenever he or she was subjected to harassment in the form of ragging. (Yohan Perera and Ajith Siriwardana)

## Title: Convicting the US of war crimes

Convicting the US of war crimes
	
Fatou Bensouda
?
There is a clock ticking towards July 20. That is when the International Criminal Court for War Crimes goes into its summer recess. The question is will it be able in the six weeks that remain start proceedings against the US for alleged war crimes committed in Afghanistan???
The court originally held a preliminary investigation in 2006. It ruled that evidence of war crimes existed, but with fewer than 20 allegations it decided to proceed no further. But later that year fresh evidence came to light and it reopened the case.??
Afghanistan joined the ICC in 2003. The US never did though President Bill Clinton tried hard to win approval.??
At the moment the ICC has seven cases, beside the US one, that remain under on-going examination: Colombia, the UK in Iraq and Afghanistan, Palestine, Nigeria, Ukraine and Gabon.??
On November 3rd last year the ICC?s chief prosecutor, Ms Fatou Bensouda requested that the judges of the pre-trial chamber authorize an investigation into alleged perpetrators of war crimes in Afghanistan and three other countries which had a ?nexus? with the Afghan conflict: Poland, Romania and Lithuania. The CIA had so-called ?Black Sites? in these countries where the CIA could torture at will without any legal supervision or responsibility. The Taliban were also included in the request. A UN Senate report said the allegations were true.??
Since the alleged crimes - torture, cruel treatment and outrages upon personal dignity- were committed on Afghani soil the US cannot veto the proceedings. The European Union is a member of the ICC but, sadly, has not expressed support for the court in this case. The US could escape these accusations if it could prove to the court it had adequately investigated abuses by its own forces. President Barack Obama was against that, believing that the US should not look back, it should go forward. However, on his first day in office he abolished torture.??
According to a New York Times article of November 3 last year, ?Lawyers and international justice experts who have followed the court expressed little doubt that Ms Bensouda has evidence that could implicate Americans?.??
?
The US has tried these tacks, feeling out the prosecutor?s office, but? to no avail. There were too many pressures going the other way. African? countries had been complaining, threatening to leave, because they were? convinced the ICC only focused on Africa?
?
If American soldiers and CIA personnel are found guilty the US will probably not accept the verdict. Under federal statute cooperation with the ICC in prosecuting Americans is prohibited. President George W. Bush was so seized with this that he sought immunity agreements from member states. He threatened to cut off aid. He blocked UN peacekeeping resolutions at the Security Council. He got Congress to pass a law authorizing the use of military force to rescue Americans from The Hague should one ever be detained by the court.??
After a while this anti ICC campaign fizzled out. In fact Bush started to cooperate with the court. It began when the then secretary of state, Condoleezza Rice, travelled to the UN to cast a vote in favour of referring the near-genocidal situation in Darfur, Sudan, to the ICC. The Obama Administration voted for two further referrals. Bipartisan-supported legislation allowed the state department to offer multi-million dollar rewards for information helping to bring fugitives to ICC justice.??
Washington has had plenty of time to see the Afghanistan prosecutions coming. They could, if the somewhat lethargic court gets a move on, be approved next month.??
Stephen Pomper, a former White House adviser on ICC policy, has written that the US could argue that the Afghani crimes are not grave enough for ICC consideration compared with say Cambodia or Rwanda.??
Another thought is that the ICC could be persuaded to conclude that the combination of the US military justice mechanisms and a department of justice investigation of the CIA would be sufficient to persuade the prosecutor to step back. But that hasn?t happened.??
The US has tried these tacks, feeling out the prosecutor?s office, but to no avail. There were too many pressures going the other way. African countries had been complaining, threatening to leave, because they were convinced the ICC only focused on Africa. Human Rights organisations have built a convincing case that the US has not adequately investigated the allegations of torture. As for the ?gravity? question it doesn?t stand up- it would look like nothing more than smokescreen. Moreover, ICC judges have signalled that they prefer to see the prosecutor err on the side of inclusion when seeking permission to proceed with an investigation.??
Is there anything the US can do now? It can?t return to the Bush tactics of bullying member states to close down the investigation- they couldn?t. Another alternative would be to come out ?swinging against the fundamental legitimacy of the court.?
This is what Israel did when the prosecutor initiated her preliminary examination of the situation in Palestine three years ago?, says Stephen Pomper. The Israeli government later backed off.??
Is the US prepared to stand alone, a de facto ally of the regimes it most detests, or will it submit to the court???

G7 leaders set  to clash with combative Trump over tariffs, trade
	
?
REUTERS, 08th JUNE, 2018- Leaders of the Group of Seven rich nations are set to clash with a combative U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday when they pressure him to lift sanctions on steel and aluminum they fear could lead to a trade war.
The confrontation threatens to rupture a body that during its 43-year history has traditionally sought to find consensus on the economy and other issues.
Trump, who aides say has little interest in multilateralism, twice attacked Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Twitter on Thursday and officials concede the mood is likely to be exceptionally tense.
?There will be some serious disagreements on a lot of things,? a Canadian official told reporters late on Thursday.
Although Trump says the tariffs are necessary to protect U.S. industry, Canada and the European Union have denounced them as illegal and are preparing retaliatory measures.
French President Emmanuel Macron said on Thursday leaders needed to be civil at the summit but he is clearly losing patience with the U.S. President, suggesting the other six members of the G7 could form their own grouping if necessary.

JO cry foul over SLRC critique of some MPs
	
Joint Opposition MPs yesterday complained that State TV station SLRC had violated their Parliamentary Privileges by opposing them at a programme, which was telecasted last morning.
MP Ranjith Soysa said himself and MP Sisira Jayakody were attacked by the SLRC last morning.
?We named few persons who had allegedly obtained cheques from Perpetual Treasuries Chief in the House on Thursday and we heard these people participating in a TV programme telecasted on national TV Channel attacking us in abusive language. This is a violation of our Parliamentary Privileges,? he said.
He said names of those who have transacted with Aloysius should be revealed as soon as possible.
?They said 118 people have obtained cheques and also now they say 166 have encashed cheques received from Aloysius and we request you to reveal their names,? he added.
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya said there were no such lists.
?The Police and other sources have informed me that there was no such list. There is no point in talking about this in the House every morning,? he said.
MP Kanchana Weerasekera said one State Minister?s name had been revealed following disclosures made by their Personal Security Officers. Also, he said a prominent person in the Government had told the IGP not to produce B Reports on any MPs.
The Speaker said carrying out of investigations were true but there was no such list available. (Yohan Perera and Ajith Siriwardana)

Legal Provisions available for Sri Lankan Women, involved in political space? ?
?
In terms of the Article 12(2), Chapter III on fundamental rights in the 1978 Constitution of Sri Lanka, the State pledges to ensure that no citizen shall be discriminated against on the grounds of disability, race, religion, language, caste, sex, political opinion and occupation.? ?
?
As per the Article 27(6) of the Constitution of Sri Lanka, the State shall ensure equal opportunities to citizens, so that no citizen shall suffer any disability on the ground of race, religion, caste, language, sex, political opinion or occupation.? ?
?
As per the Article 7(4) of the amendment to Sri Lanka Parliamentary Elections Act 58 of 2009, every recognized political party shall ensure the inclusion of one or more women office bearers in the list of office bearers of such party to guarantee better representation of women in political parties and in politics.? ?
?
As per the instructions of the Elections Commissioner pertaining to the registration of political parties, the political parties shall ensure the inclusion of at least one woman office bearer in the list of office bearers of the party.? ?
?
Every recognized political party shall ensure the inclusion of one or more women office bearers in the list of office bearers of such party to guarantee better representation of women in political parties and in politics
?
?
According to the amendment to Sri Lanka Local Government Elections Act No.16 of 2017, women?s representation of any local authority shall be guaranteed to be not less than 25 % of the total number of Councillors. (The nomination papers submitted shall include 10% female candidates on ward level and 50% in the list of proportionate representation.)? ?
?
According to the amendment to Sri Lanka Local Government Elections Act No.17 of 2017, women?s representation of any local authority shall be guaranteed to be not less than 25% of the total number of Councillors. (The nomination papers submitted shall include 17% female candidates on ward level and 50% in the list of proportionate representation).? ?
?
?
Women?s Representation - Legal Status Vs Practice? ?
1. There is no women?s representation at all, at decision making levels in 26 of 59 registered political parties in Sri Lanka.
The above chart reflects that 26 political parties had disregarded the law.? ?
?
2. There are only 46 women in the aggregate list of 602 office bearers in 59 registered political parties. This indicates that the women?s representation is only 8%.? ?
?
3.? As per the data available for 2015, five political parties out of 14 represented in Parliament do not have a single female member in their decision-making committees. This reflects that 36% of political parties represented in Parliament had disregarded the law that governed the registration of political parties.
?
As per No.16 of the Act 2017, ?women?s representation in local authorities shall be guaranteed at 25%?. But, as per the results of the local government election held on 10 February 2018,? ?
1. Not a single female Councillor had been elected in respect of two local authorities i.e. Manmunai Pattu Pradeshiya Sabah in the Batticaloa District and Kinya Municipal Council in the Trincomalee District? ?
2. Sixteen local authorities had failed to ensure 25% women?s representation. The list of Local Councils in which women?s representation target was not achieved is given in the last page.? ?
?
3. Of the 10% nominations submitted by women candidates on ward level, 535 have been elected. It exceeds 10% share (10.5%) of the overall number of Councillors elected i.e. 5092.? ?
?
4. The number of female councillors elected under the proportional representation is 1384.? ?
?
5. The total number of Female councillors elected was 1919. It amounts to 23% of the total number of 8325 members (without overhang seats). When the overhang number is added, the percentage share will rise up to 22.08%. This can be reckoned to be a good sign.? ?
?
Challenges, the Female Candidates had to encounter at the last Local Government Elections? ?
The challenges, female candidates encountered at the last local government elections can be classified into three phases, as follows:? ?
?
During nomination time; During election time; During post election time (when selecting councillors for the list of proportional representation).? ?
?
The challenges encountered during nomination time:? ?
?
There was no proper system of selecting candidates.? ?
	There were incidents in which some unsuspecting candidates had fallen victims to deceptive practices.? ?
	Incidents of soliciting sexual bribes as a condition for granting nominations.? ?
	Lack of financial strength.? ?
	Lack of direct contacts with the chief organizers of the electorate and the unlimited power enjoyed by them.? ?
	Obstructions caused by certain religious circles.? ?
	Obstructions posed by family circles in obtaining nominations.? ?
	Cultural hindrances.? ?
Challenges encountered during election time:? ?
1. Incidents of sexual harassment? ?
2. Incidents of election violence.? ?
3. Incidents of character assassination.? ?
4. Incidents of being reproached by certain religious leaders and development of a social opinion that women shall not engage in active politics.? ?
5. Difficulties encountered in propaganda activities during night.? ?
?
?
Challenges faced during Post election time:? ?
1. Absence of a proper system or criteria of selecting female candidates from the proportional representation list, resulting in competent women being eliminated from selection.? ?
?
2. Selection of Councillors, almost 100%, at the sole discretion of electoral organizers of respective political parties.? ?
?
3. Demanding sexual bribes for enrollment of names in the list of proportional representation.? ?
A long-term action plan should be introduced to overcome and minimize these problems at future elections.? ?
?
Was it due to Women?s Representation that the total number of Councillors had gone up in Local Authorities?? ?
There is a widespread opinion that the women?s representation had caused a significant increase in the number of Councillors in Local Authorities. It is absolutely a wrong opinion. Not a single Councillor was added to Local Government Councils on account of the introduction of mandatory women?s representation. It is a myth.? ?
?
?
What had caused the increase in the number of Councillors in Local Authorities?? ?
The increase in the number of Councillors had been based on a policy decision reached by the Political Parties and the Legislature. In enacting the Local Authorities Elections (Amendment) Act, No. 22 of 2012, one major concern of all political parties had been to introduce a methodology to ensure that after the amendment was implemented, they could still maintain the number of Councillors they had in each local authority at the time of passing the bill. Accordingly, the number of wards in respect of each Local Authority was decided to ensure that the number of seats owned by respective political parties would not suffer a reduction under the new system and the number of seats held by them prior to the amendment should remain unchanged. Accordingly, a mixed system of proportional representation based on the ratio of 70:30 was introduced. This meant that 70% of the total number of Councillors was to be elected by ward level and 30% by the system of proportional representation. (2012 No 22) Consequently, there was a 35% increase at the first stage itself.? ?
?
At the second amendment (2016-1), an additional quota of 25% was introduced for women?s representation. This caused an increase of 25% of the number of Councilllors.?
?
At the third amendment (2016-16), the ratio of 70%-30% was altered as 60%-40%. Accordingly, there was a 10% increase in the number elected on ward basis and 10% on the number elected on proportional representation, resulting in an overall increase of 20% in the number of Councillors. Also, through this amendment, the separate quota of 25% allocated for women?s representation was incorporated into ward level nomination list and also the list of proportional representation. Moreover, the women?s quota was integrated into the main stream, allocating 10% to be contested on the ward level list and 50% to be selected from the list of proportional representation. This resulted in the elimination of the additional quota of 25% which was there at the second stage and complete removal of the additional increase caused by the system of women?s representation.? ?
?
1. The total number of Councillors appointed as per the system of election prevailed prior to 2012 was 4485.? ?
2. Following the first amendment (70%-30%) this number increased to 6263.? ?
3. Following the second amendment i.e. after granting a quota of 25% for women?s representation, the total number of Councillors? ?
4. At the third amendment the 70%-30% ratio was changed to be 60%-40% and the 25% women?s quota was integrated into it. This resulted in reducing the 25% increase made at the second amendment. However, as the system of election was changed by altering the ratio as 60-40, there has been a slight increase in the number of Councillors.? ?
?
This explains that the increase in the number of Councillors owing to the introduction of 25% women?s quota by the second amendment had been completely eliminated by the third amendment and the total number of Councillors reached in par with the number that remained after the second amendment. Thus, it is evident that the 25% women?s representation has not caused any increase in the total number of Councillors.? ?
?
?
Has the number of Councillors increased due to the introduction of women?s representation into the system of provincial council elections?? ?
A new system has been introduced for Provincial Council elections as well. It is also a mixed system including proportional representation. The ratio is 50-50. This means that 50% will be selected by ward level and 50% by the system of proportional representation. But, the number of Councillors entitled for each party, will be decided on the system of proportional representation. The women?s representation in Provincial Councils will be based on the same system that has been adopted in the case of Local government elections. Accordingly,? ?
?
1. The territorial list should have 17% female candidates.? ?
2. The proportional representation list should have 50 % female candidates.? ?
3. At the conclusion of the elections, the Election Commission must ensure the 25% representation by women.? ?
?
Here, the 3:1 ratio applicable to local government elections has been removed and the quota of 25% will be distributed proportionately among the political parties which had secured 20% or more votes.? ?
But, the chances are more for women?s representation to be distributed between the two major political parties. The minor parties, unless they contest and secure seats/Councillorships, will find the opportunities limited for them to secure seats through proportional representation.? ?
?
It must be stressed that the inclusion of women?s representation in the Provincial Council system will not cause any increase in the number of Councilors.?
?
?
Is the mandatory women?s representation, a challenge or a blessing for political parties?? ?
It seems that the 25% women?s quota introduced with the system of Local Government Elections has become a challenge and a nuisance for some political parties. On the contrary, some political parties have satisfactorily adapted to this new requirement. In view of the general resistance for change, adaptation to a new system and withdrawal from an existing system which had been in operation for a long time is equally difficult.? ?
?
Some political parties have satisfactorily adapted to this new requirement. In view of the general resistance for change, adaptation to a new system and withdrawal from an existing system which had been in operation for a long time is equally difficult
?
?
When the women?s quota was implemented for the first time, it might have posed a challenge for the political parties. This is because there was no strong mechanism in political parties to promote women?s representation at local level. But this situation can be expected to be only a temporary drawback that will change at the next election. It might be a great blessing for political parties interested in extending opportunities for women?s representation. The local and provincial leadership of political parties will certainly be strengthened by the increase in women?s representation, particularly in a country where 52% of voters are women. When more and more women begin to serve as people?s representatives in local authorities and political and administrative powers are passed on to them, it is natural that women at village level will tend to rally round them irrespective of political differences. If a strong women?s front is built within the political parties, it will certainly serve as an extra force making an active contribution to the parties concerned at their election campaigns.? ?
?
?
What should be done to increase women?s representation in realistic politics?? ?
It is important that short term and long term measures be taken at grass root level to increase women?s representation in politics. The local government institutions have already received a 25% quota of women?s representation. As per the election results, except for 5% of local authorities, all the other LAs have achieved the stipulated level of women?s representation. The organizers who take the lead in improving the women?s representation should focus their immediate attention on how to make the best use of the representation already achieved. Before the end of the four year term, it is incumbent upon the female Councillors to make a significant change in the local government sphere despite whatever obstacle that may come on their way. If they fail to make a positive, tangible and conspicuous impact, it is most likely that they might lose the opportunity in the future.? ?
?
?
Short term measures to be adopted to build a strong women?s leadership.? ?
1. Improvement of the subject knowledge of the Councillors? ?
It is of no use at this point to talk about the inadequacies of quality, the knowledge and the political background of the Councillors appointed following the recent local government election. What is needed now is to enrich their subject knowledge urgently, strengthen their capacity and equip them with strategic orientation so that they could discharge their responsibilities with confidence. In this case, the books and pamphlets on local government administration i.e. the official role of LAs , financial control, tender procedures, committee system, formulation of by-laws, local government rule must be printed in simple language and distributed among the Councillors enabling them to be familiar with the subject and gain a practical knowledge needed for their service.? ?
?
?
2. Personality development programmes? ?
?The majority of Councillors elected do not possess previous experience in politics. As they have been introduced to politics by the organizers of the respective political parties, they are not in a position to make independent decisions of their own. As the electoral organizers often tend to act contravening the policies of their political parties, it is important that the personality of the new Councillors be strengthened enabling them to face this situation with confidence. It is also important that they are made aware as to how they should respond to national level political fluctuations.? ?
?
?
3. Public relations and charismatic leadership? ?
An ongoing training program must be introduced for this. They should be given a practical training on how to strike a balance between the relationship they maintain with the voters who elected them and the national level politics.? ?
?
?
4. Bring forth the inborn talents of women? ?
A program aimed at bringing forth inborn talents of women and enhancing their leadership qualities should be implemented. Especially, the manner in which their inborn talents and qualities are applied for fulfilment of the role of local authorities is very important.? ?
?
?
5. Strategic Orientation? ?
In the existing political culture, the strategic orientation is more important than offering traditional training programs. For this, a specific program must be introduced to equip them with emergent strategic orientation of Local Administration. This is to be conducted on regular basis by professional experts in business field and other relevant spheres, who are having specialist knowledge in their respective fields of expertise.? ?
?
?
6. Setting up of the Forums of Women Councillors at District and National level? ?
These Forums can be of two types. It is important that they are set up on the basis of political parties as well as independent committees without political bias. These Forums can help develop their leadership qualities, exchange knowledge, give wide expression to women?s voices fusing them into a unified force, and appear on behalf of the female Councilors in resolving their issues.? ?
?
?
7. Use of media? ?
By now, media is making a considerable impact both in making and ruining politicians throughout the world. Sri Lanka is not an exception. Therefore, the new Councillors must be educated comprehensively on the use of media and technology. There must be a regular, practical program to educate them on how they should deal with the local media persons.? ?
?
?
Networking of women?s organizations and work according to a Common plan? ?
There are many women?s political organizations in operation at present. But, there is no proper coordination among them. Different organizations offer training programs of same type and to the same group over and over again. The knowledge they impart this way is not complete and wholesome. Therefore, it is necessary that the training will be based on a common agenda. At this moment, at least there should be a coordinating body to share and exchange information among women?s political organizations.? ?
?
?
Programme for sharing experiences? ?
By the time the quota system was introduced, there was already a 2% women?s representation in the local government administration. There should be a program to share their experience with the newly elected Councilors. Besides this, a similar program is needed to share the successful experiences of the new Councilors as well.? ?
?
?
A Follow-up system? ?
A system of follow up should be adopted to identify the challenges faced by Female Councilors and remedy them at least once in six months.
?
?
A System of Performance Assessment? ?
A methodology to assess the performance of the Female Councillors should be initiated at national level. A National Organization or the Ministry of Women?s Affairs may take the leadership in this. This will invariably pave the way for women to enter the arena of national politics.? ?
?
A Newspaper for Women?s Voice? ?
Publication of a Women?s Newspaper will help yielding beneficial results in promoting active involvement of Female Councillors, communicating and sharing their experiences.? ?
?
Strengthening their Family Units? ?
A programme must be initiated to strengthen the family units of Women Councillors selected for representing the Local Authorities, economically.? ?
?
Management of Political life and the Personal Life? ?
It is important that an advisory committee is appointed to provide counseling to newly elected Female Councillors on how they should manage their political life and personal life. Social scientists and stress management councilors can be appointed to this advisory committee.? ?
?
Training for family members? ?
Separate workshops should be held for the family members of female Councillors, particularly aimed at their husbands.? ?
Long Term Proposals to Promote Women?s Contribution to Advancement of Politics.? ?
?
Legal Amendments? ?
1. The Elections Commission should be compelled to exercise the Law strictly when political parties are registered. This will help to get, at least one female office bearer appointed to the decision making arms of the political parties.? ?
2. The political parties should be compelled to include 30% women in their decision making structures. Also the legislature should be compelled to bring necessary amendments to the Law governing the registration of political parties, making this requirement a minimum condition.? ?
3. Legal provision must be introduced making it mandatory for all political parties to have a political structure that consists of women too within the party.? ?
4. In order to encourage women to contest elections, an amendment to the elections law should be brought in so that the election commission will be empowered to reimburse a certain percentage of election expenses incurred, at least for the winning candidates. (Canada)? ?
5. The Ministry of Women?s Affairs must take the lead in formulating a national program of action to promote women?s participation. The funds needed for this must be allocated from the annual budget. (L. Selvadorai)? ?
6. The law should be amended to exempt female candidates from paying the prescribed election deposit in order to encourage them to contest at elections.? ?
7. The laws should be enacted making it compulsory that one third of the nominees to the national list shall be women.? ?
8. A separate electoral ward system or a system that is changed from one election to the other must be introduced for women?s representation.?
?
?

## Title: Listen to the Ocean: ?Stop destroying me?

Listen to the Ocean: ?Stop destroying me?
	
?
Listen to the Ocean, echoes of a million seashells. Forever it?s in motion, moving to a rhythmic, unwritten music that?s played eternally. Immortal songs such as this need to be remembered and replayed for World Ocean Day, which the international community marked, yesterday.? ?
Environmental scientists have told us the horrible truth about how wicked and selfish human nature is. They estimate that every year, we dump more than eight million tonnes of plastic or polythene into the ocean. They say that about three trillion pieces of plastic or polythene are thrown into the ocean every year, fish and hundreds of other marine species eat this and many of them die. Recently, we heard of the terrible story in Thailand, where a whale died after consuming as much as 17 pounds of plastic or polythene. In turn we eat fish which have consumed plastic and give it to our children also. That may be one of the reasons why many of us are falling sick more often and some ailments cannot be diagnosed by medical specialists.? ?
To mark World Ocean Day, the Cable News Network (CNN) telecast a report saying a coral fertility treatment designed to help heal damaged parts of Australia?s Great Barrier Reef is showing signs of success and now needs to be scaled up to create a bigger impact. The Great Barrier Reef is regarded as one of the natural wonders of the world.? ?
The Project Chief Peter Harrison, a professor at Southern Cross University in Australia, says he is ?excited by the results? which show the experimental process known as ?coral IVF? is working on a small scale. Recently returned from a trip to the reef, Mr. Harrison says his team managed to ?significantly increase? the numbers of baby coral on reefs at Heron Island and One Tree Island, where they laid millions of coral larvae 18 months ago. The 2,300-kilometer-long Great Barrier Reef -- a UNESCO World Heritage Site -- lost around half of its coral in the past few years after two mass bleaching events in 2016 and 2017, a pattern repeated on coral reefs around the world, CNN says.? ?
The bleaching occurs when warmer ocean temperatures caused by climate change put major stress on coral organisms, turning them white. If they don?t have time to recover, they eventually die.??
The coral IVF project is designed to help reefs repopulate faster to help speed up the recovery time after a bleaching event. In the most recent Australian summer, there was little or no coral bleaching, but scientists expect it to start happening with increasing frequency as the planet continues heating up.? ?
In a statement, the United Nations says, we mark World Oceans Day to remind us of the major role the oceans have in everyday life. They are the lungs of our planet, providing most of the oxygen we breathe. The purpose is to inform the people of the impact of human actions on the ocean, develop a worldwide movement of citizens for the ocean and mobilize and unite the world?s population on a project for the sustainable management of the world?s oceans. They are a major source of food and medicines and a critical part of the biosphere.? ?
?The 2018 theme is preventing plastic pollution and encouraging solutions for a healthy ocean. Some 80% of all pollution in the ocean comes from people on land. Eight million tonnes of plastic a year ends up in the ocean, wreaking havoc on wildlife, fisheries and tourism. Plastic pollution costs the lives of 1 million seabirds and 100,000 marine mammals a year. Fish eat plastic, and we eat the fish. Plastic causes $8 billion in damage to marine ecosystems each year.??
According to the UN, there are many things we can do as individuals to reduce our plastic consumption.?
Remember to use less plastic and recycle the plastic you must use. Use these hashtags in social media to spread the word to help clean up our ocean: #WorldOceansDay, #SaveOurOcean.??
Britain?s Guardian newspaper reported recently that faced with shops full of food and other goods swathed in plastic, families across the world are trying to reduce its use and recycle wherever possible to cut down its impact on the environment.??
Sri Lanka, surrounded by the ocean must be fairly high on the list of pollutants. Let us take a decision today that by using less plastic, we will help prevent a catastrophe whereby within decades 50% of our oceans will be polluted by plastic.? ?

MPs protest over TNL curb
	
The Government and the Opposition MPs vehemently opposed the sealing of TNL Transmission Tower in Polgahawela last morning, questioning as to whether it was a beginning of a dangerous trend of suppressing media.
The condemnation came when Joint Opposition Parliamentary Group Leader Dinesh Gunawardane raised a question on the issue under the new Standing Orders 27(2) in Parliament last morning.
Mr Gunawardane questioned as to what the Government would do to rectify this situation.
?The TNL had been taken to courts this morning and we do not know what will become of it in the next few days. How could the CID officers enter the transmitting station forcibly and seal the transmitting station as we are not under a dictatorship,? he questioned.
The MP stressed that licence could be cancelled and a station could be sealed only after giving due notice as per the Telecommunication Act. He said such notice had not been given.
He said there was no issue in paying license fees as the station had made the payments up to 2017 and was negotiating with TRC to resolve some issues pertaining to licence fees that had popped up thereafter.
He said the TNL was corresponding with TRCSL to resolve the matter.
Also, he questioned as to whether President Maithripala Sirisena could hold TRCSL under his purview under the 19th Amendment to the Constitution.
He said President could hold Defence Ministry and the Mahaweli Ministry according to 19th Amendment according to his knowledge.
?We don?t care about the political ideologies of TNL Chief Shan Wickremesinghe, but we are concerned about the fate the media is suffering.
?Besides Mr Shan Wickremesinghe is the person who started a TV transmission in 1979 and it was taken over by the Government as it failed to put up a photo of then-President J. R. Jayewardene at the station,? Mr Gunawardane added.
Mr Gunawardane said TNL produced several personalities such as Buddhika Pathirana, who is an MP today.
MP Pathirana then said the present Government did not come to power to shut down TV stations.
?This is a shameless as we did not come to shut down TV channels,? he said.
?This is nothing but a joke,? he said while condemning the blocking of Lankaenews website as well.
MP Bandula Gunawardane said the CSN has also suffered the same fate as TNL.
?We are standing up for media freedom irrespective of party differences,? he said.
Minister Malik Samarawickrama said he too was against the move to seal the TNL transmitting tower.
However, he said it was not reasonable for the Opposition to charge that there was a dictatorship as there were attacks on media during the last regime as well.
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya then assured that he would get Minister of Telecom and Digital Infrastructure Development Harin Fernando to make a statement in the House on the issue.
Meanwhile, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe declined to make any statement on the matter though MPs questioned him as well.
?I don?t think I should make a comment on the matter,? he said. (Yohan Perera and Ajith Siriwardana)

Remembering a large-hearted tradeunionist
	
?Desigar Ramanujam was born in Ramanathapuram, South India on 17th July 1907. Upon completing his higher studies he commenced a career is journalism. In the late 1920s Ramanujam, by then an accomplished writer, came to Sri Lanka and joined the editorial staff of a Tamil Newspaper Desa Bakthan.? ?
In 1943 he joined the teaching staff at Dharmaraja Collage, Kandy. Due to his fluency in English and Tamil he was called upon by the Courts in Kandy to assist them in translating evidences from Tamil to English. During this period, noticing difficulties encountered by the poor Tamil workers, particularly working in the Kandy Municipal Council, he went on to form an Association under the name Bose Sangam. These efforts were to safeguard the rights of Indian workers who lived in Mahiyawa and Asgiriya.? ?
During this period several such trade unions were formed in different parts of the upcountry to represent the Indian workers brought to Sri Lanka by the British Plantation Companies to work in the estates.? ?
In 1937, Shri Jawarhalal Nehru was sent to Sri Lanka (then Ceylon) by Mahathma Gandhi to look in to the problems of the Indian workers. Leaders like Rajalingam from Nawalapitiya, Suppiah from Badulla and a few others who were leading their own trade unions met Shri Nehru.? ?
?Shri Nehru?s advised the leaders to dissolve their individual trade unions and form one national trade union to represent the Indian workers. Thus, the Ceylon Indian Congress (CIC) was born. This later became Ceylon Workers Congress. Ramanujam, Rajalingam, Subbiah and few others were the founding member of CIC.? ?
Ramanujam was elected to the Kandy Municipal Council in1943. He represented the Asgiriya ward and in 1946 became the first person of Indian Origin to be elected as the Deputy Mayor of Kandy. During this period he was credited with providing pipe-borne water to the Asgiriya Maha Viharaya of Asgiriya Chapter. He had the blessing of the Venerable Mahanayaka Thera of the Asgiriya Chapter who urged the residents of Asgiriya Ward to support Ramanujam, who served the ward for 13 successive years.? ?
Ramanujam was elected at the first Parliamentary Elections held between 23 August 1947 and September 1947. He contested as an independent candidate in the Aluthnuwara Electorate (presently Mahiyangana) securing 46.6% of the total vote; 1437 votes ahead of his nearest rival. He defeated three candidates from the majority community. He thus became one of the seven CIC members elected to parliament in 1947.? ?
Ramanujam worked tirelessly for the rights of the plantation worker as the joint Secretary of the Ceylon Workers Congress. He represented Sri Lanka as the workers? delegate at several Annual meetings of the International Labour Organization (ILO). His contributions at these sessions were well appreciated.? ?
In 1961 Prime Minister Srimavo Bandaranaike offered Ramanujam an appointed MP seat in Parliament becaue of the close friendship he had with the late SWRD Bandaranaike and with the Prime Minister. But he declined it in favour of Ceylon Workers Congress President Savumyamurthi Thondaman; much to the disappointment of the Premier.? ?
The Prime Minister wasn?t happy, but it took a lot of convincing by Ramanujam to make Mrs Bandaranaike offer the MP post to Thondaman.? ?
In 1962, the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) recognizing his contribution to the trade union movement and his achievements at the ILO meetings, invited him to join their organization, where he was given the task of organizing the sugar plantation workers in Mauritius. He was subsequently sent to Ethiopia to establish Trade Unions during the regime of Emperor Haisalasi.? ?
In 1965 ICFTU appointed Ramanujam as the special representative in Singapore. His task was to persuade the National Trade Union Congress of Singapore to amend its constitution to become an internationally accepted Trade Union. He was then made to Reginal Director in South East Asia.? ?
In the 1968 the ICFTU appointed Ramanujam as the Director of Asian Region (Where he had to be based in India). However he died unexpectedly on 4th June 1968 before he could take up the posting. Thus, the international trade union movement lost a simple human being who served the cause of the workers in Sri Lanka and internationally.?

Security Chiefs refuse meetings: TNA
	
The Tamil National Alliance MP Charles Nirmalanathan yesterday alleged that Chiefs of Security Forces in the North and East were refusing to meet them and said they had no one to discuss issues of their people.
The MP told Parliament that he made several requests to meet a Navy Officer in the North but he had refused to give him an appointment without an approval of the Defence Ministry.
"I made several requests to meet a Navy Commander in the North to discuss an issue related to the fishing community there. I even wrote to the Defence Ministry but there was no reply as yet," he said.
The leader of the House Lakshman Kiriella said the MPs should be given an opportunity to meet the Chiefs of Security Forces and that he would look into the matter.
Meanwhile, JVP MP Nalinda Jayatissa said it was pointless to hold debates if relevant Ministers were absent in Parliament to answer the MPs questions. (Ajith Siriwardana and Yohan Perera)

Sri Lanka?s rich tradition of conducting Upasampada
	
An Upasamapada ceremony being conducted
?
Upasampada or higher ordination ceremonies haven?t changed over the years and still remain as they were conducted in 1773. ?The Graphic? of January 1576 describes a ?A Buddhist Ordination of Ceylon?.? ?
An account on this ordination written by a British reporter states, ?A celebration witnessed by a few, and a few Europeans in Ceylon, was held according to some customs on the full moon day of Vesak. Vesak is considered as the day on which Gautama Buddha attained Nirvana (enlightenment). Then it goes on to describe the preparations and the ceremonies themselves. The writer says ?Candidates for higher ordination are bought on elephants to the place where the ceremony is to be held. They are dressed in their best attire and are accompanied by their friends. They are proceeded by musicians and dancers. On arrival at the Chapter House (Part of a monastery) each candidate is received by his tutor and is presented to the assembled Chapter. The chapter is presided by the Chief Priest. The proceedings are solemn and impressive and without variation from the ceremonies held 2000 years ago. He continues to describe this ?The Chapter House is an oblong hall with rows of pillars forming an inner space and aisles. At the top of this inner space sat the president of the Chapter. On either side of the candidate sat the elder priest and down the sides sat the other priests numbering between thirty and forty. The President sat on a cushion while the other priests sat on mats. They all sat cross-legged?.? ?
?
Before an individual can reach this status of Higher Ordination the Samanera performs the essential rites within the temple where was ordained
?
Perfoming Upasampada rites
yellow robes
He continues, ?The candidate kneels down before the priest and receives from him the yellow robes of a priest. He then asks to be officially dressed to renounce this world. He is assisted by his tutor to don the yellow robes of a celibate priest, and to say, ? In wisdom I put on the robes as a protection against cold, heat, gadflies and mosquitoes, wind and the sun, the touch of serpents and to cover a naked body?.? ?
The writer says he returned to the presence of the Chapter and examined how these candidates take usual vows to gear themselves for the duties and a life of a priest. He says that the place was furnished by the Government Agent J.F.Dickson of the Ceylon Civil Service. The writer says that it could be added that many corrupt practices and innovations have been introduced by the Northern Buddhists in Ceylon. Ths form of religion so closely resembles Christianity, but retains almost its pristine purity. It?s recorded that a Roman Catholic priest had translated the procedural system of Upasampada and had it delivered to the Holiness the Pope to adopt the same system for ordination. There is no record of this being done. But the writer refers to both the ?The Graphic? and ?Harper Weekly? of February 1876 noted that Christianity could have incorporated some of these aspects for their ceremonies. It is also felt that some of them could be incorporated during ceremonies in Rome. Upasampada was conducted during Buddha?s time and the Buddha himself conducted the rites of conferring Upasampada. This is known as ?Ehi Bhikkhu ? Higher Ordination. The present Upasampada is the eighth form out of these rites. It is known as ?Gnatrtichatthasaupa Upasampada?. Higher ordination can be conducted in two areas: Jala Seemawa ? or in an area surrounded by water or Badda Seemawa which is a demarcated Sacred area. In both the two Maha Viharas these rites are conducted in a marked area.? ?

Upasampada? ?
Sri Lanka possessed Upasampada rites which were even taken to Thailand (earlier Siam ). They were named Lankawamsarites. But it waned away and it was left to Sangharaja Asarana Sarana Weliwita, with the blessings of King Kirthi Sri Rajasinghe to obtain the rites back from Thailand and bring it to Sri Lanka in 1753. The ceremony was held at Malwatte Maha Viaharaya in a sacred area.?
?Upasampada is looked forward to by all monks who enter the following of Gautama Buddha. Before an individual can reach this status of Higher Ordination the Samanera performs the essential rites within the temple where was ordained. During this period he also visits a Pirivena, where he was taught the doctrine preached by Gautama Buddha. Sometimes it so happens that if there is no pirivena, an elder monk who has received High Ordination can teach the monk the precepts and rites of the ?Buddha Sasana?.??
?In the morning hours of the day of Upasampada, the elders at the Maha Viharas tests the Samanera regarding the essentials of the doctrine of Gautama Buddha. This is to check whether he could preach the Dhamma to the people.?
