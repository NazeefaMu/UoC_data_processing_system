Basel III widely applied in APAC; state support remains
	
The implementation of the Basel III regulatory framework across most of the banking systems in Asia Pacific (APAC) should help to strengthen the banks financial profiles and support their viability ratings, says Fitch Ratings.
Fitch assessed the changing regulatory frameworks - including comparing the key features of Basel III implementation such as CET1 requirements, counter-cyclical capital buffers, resolution frameworks and liquidity regulations - in the APAC Banks Regulatory Compendium published yesterday. Of the 17 banking sectors that were assessed, 13 are adopting the latest Basel standards.
The work of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) has influenced regulators in both member and non-member countries in a number of ways. The most significant changes are the requirements for higher levels of common equity due to the introduction of various capital buffers. In addition, the approach to risk-weighted assets (RWAs) assessment has been under revision, while some regulators have been increasing the risk weights on their own initiative.
Hong Kong leads the way in the region with a minimum core equity Tier I requirement for larger banks in the 10 percent - 12 percent range, being the only APAC jurisdiction to introduce a counter-cyclical buffer above zero. All APAC Basel III countries are adopting the recommended 2.5 percent capital conservation buffer and frameworks for counter-cyclical capital buffers have also been introduced across a number of jurisdictions. Multiple jurisdictions are demanding additional capital for their largest institutions, with Japan and China being the only jurisdictions with banks of global systemic importance.
The international discussion around improving the resolvability of banks has also gained traction in APAC, with some jurisdictions overhauling their frameworks. A few countries such as New Zealand and Japan have already established bank resolution regimes and certain resolution powers were already available in other jurisdictions including Singapore, Korea, Malaysia and the Philippines. Powers to write-down and convert claims of creditors into equity (bail-in) remain the least well established.
That said there is still an overwhelming bias in the region towards authorities being more supportive of banks than in Europe or the US. Only in Hong Kong and New Zealand does Fitch not expect sovereign support to be provided in APAC.

Hold LG polls to fulfill peoples democratic right: NFF
	
The National Freedom Front (NFF) today urged the government to immediately hold the local government election in order to offer peoples democratic rights.
Addressing a media briefing, NFF Media Spokesman Mohammed Muzammil said the local government election had been postponed since a year by depriving the peoples voting rights in an anti-democratic way.
The authorities stated the delimitations issues in provincial council level as the reason for this delay. It is kind of a joke. It can be sorted out within two months if the government has well planned the delimitations. The government is not giving their priority to this issue despite of the ability to do it, he added.
He said the Election Commissioner and the institutions such as Campaign for Free and Fair Election (CaFFE), Peoples Action for Free and Fair Elections (PAFFREL) and the Election Commission remained silent when it came to this issue.
To my knowledge the Election Commission is to hold elections but not to postpone, he added.
Meanwhile, he said the Independent Police Commission was not performing its duty in a democratic way when referring to the recent incidents such as the removal of the walking path in Wattala and the controversial accident at Rajagiriya. He also said even the Independent Election Commission was the same. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)

Information ban on CB, Trade Agreements unacceptable: JVP
	
The Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) alleged today, that the Government had restricted peoples right to obtain information on certain subjects, including information released by the Central Bank and information related to International Trade Agreements, under the new Right to Information Bill while accepting the access to information as a right.
JVP MP Vijitha Herath said it was mentioned in the Bill that releasing certain information was a punishable offence, which was unacceptable.
We can accept restrictions in obtaining information related to national security. But people have the right to obtain information related to International Trade Agreements and information of the Central Bank, he said.
Mr. Herath said people had a right to know information about International Trade Agreements such as ECTA and what impact they could make on the country, people and the future.
He said information released by the Central Bank should be available to people according to world accepted accords and added that even the World Bank had given access to its information through its website.
Mr. Herath said it was a serious matter where it was mentioned in the Bill that providing certain information could subjected to Rs. 5,000 fine or two-year imprisonment.
He said even though ensuring peoples Right To Information was a commendable move by the Government, the matters which hinder the Right To Information, should also be scrapped in the Bill. ( Ajith Siriwardana)

Joint Opposition breaking up into splinters: Minister
	
The Joint Opposition was breaking into splinters and slowly turning into a diluted group, Public Administration Minister Ranjith Madduma Bandara said today.
While addressing a media briefing, he said that the Joint Opposition members were trying to topple the Government by dashing coconuts.
A Government cannot be toppled by dashing coconuts but it only can be done through an election, the Minister said. 
Yesterday, three ministers crossed over to the Government and they are appointed as Deputy Ministers and a State Minister.
UNP MP Palitha Thewarapperuma, UPFA MP Manusha Nanayakkara and UPFA MP Lakshman Seneviratne crossed over yesterday and were appointed as Deputy Ministers and one as a State Minister. Many MPs have shown interest in joining the Government and discussions are underway, he added.
There were more than 160 ministers in the Government and the Government was strong and stable to run through the next five years, he said.
The members in the Joint Opposition were not from the Sri Lankan Freedom Party (SLFP). Those MPs hang on to the party because they have nowhere to go, he said.
The Joint Opposition MPs, who once laughed at the international organisations and to the international human rights organisations, had now gone to the Inter Parliament Union in Geneva with complaints.
They went there wearing coats and trousers without wearing our national dress. They even have no courage to wear the national dress, he said. (Chaturanga Pradeep)

JVP condemns addition of ministers
	
The Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) charged today that the Government was offering ministerial portfolios to certain MPs to please them, going against peoples mandate and wasting people's money.
JVP general secretary Tilvin Silva said it was a serious offense to appoint ministers to establish power and that it was what happened in the Rajapaksa regime as well.
Appointing ministers has become a joke now. No one can tell the exact number of ministers today as it keeps on changing day by day. Even during the Rajapaksa regime, ministers were appointed to establish power and the number of ministers exceeded 100, which drew protest of the civil society and the JVP. When we proposed that the number of ministers should be included in the constitution, the UNP and Maithripala Sirisena accepted it at that time and said ministries should be divided technically. But they are acting against their pledge, he said.
Mr. Silva said the number of ministers had reached 92 now even though it was restricted to 30 cabinet ministers and total of 40 deputy and state ministers in the constitution by adding an additional clause to evade the restrictions in the constitution.
He said ministers had been appointed without any scientific basis where Kalutara district MP Palitha Thewarapperuma had been appointed deputy minister of Wayamba Development. (Ajith Siriwardana)

Lanka, China agree to speed up port city project
	
After stalling the Colombo Port City project for a year, Sri Lanka and China had agreed to "speed up" the USD 1.5 billion Chinese-funded venture besides endorsing the ambitious Maritime Silk Road, the PTI reported today.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe - who received a red carpet welcome at the Great Hall of People - held talks with his Chinese counterpart Li Keqiang after which the two sides signed seven agreements.
They included an extradition treaty, MoUs on promoting investment and economic cooperation and preferential loan agreement for the second phase of the extension of southern highway in Sri Lanka.
But most importantly, both sides agreed to speed up the construction of the 583-acre Colombo Port City (CPC) project to be built by a Chinese state-owned company on reclaimed land that was stalled after the Maithripala Sirisena government came to power last year.
It was halted over concerns related to its environmental impact. The project was finalised during the previous Mahinda Rajapaksa regime.
"On CPC, both sides agreed to further speed up over-all and comprehensive resumption of the work at this project," Xiao Qian, Director General of the Asia Department of the Chinese Foreign Ministry told the media while briefing the outcome of the meeting between the two Prime Ministers.
He said Sri Lanka has already made the announcement to resume work. "Now we will go into further technical details," Xiao said.
While there is no clarity on technical details, reports from Colombo quoted Sri Lankan officials as saying that the China Communication Construction Company (CCCC), which undertook the project is demanding USD 125 million penalties as damages for stalling the project.
Sri Lankan officials also said Colombo wants relief as it is struggling to service USD eight billions obtained during Rajapaksa regime for various projects.
Reports said Wickremesinghe, who before his election had threatened to scrap the CPC for adverse environmental impact, is due to negotiate the penalty payment in his talks with Li.
The Sirisena government had earlier expressed serious reservations over the clause in the agreement to hand over 20 hectares of land to the CCCC on freehold basis with complete rights.

Military security of MR and Gota will be replaced-Hettiarachchi
	
Defence Secretary Karunasena Hettiarachchi today said that military personnel deployed for former President Mahinda Rajapaksa and former Defence Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa's security would be removed and replaced gradually, as deploying military personnel for VIP security is illegal.
Police and Special Task Force personnel, who are responsible for the security of VIPs would be deployed for the security of the former President and former defence secretary gradually, Mr. Hettiarachchi said.
He said even military personnel have not been deployed for the security of President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe. But former President Mahinda Rajapaksa soon after the last Presidential election had taken all his military personnel, who were assigned for his security, and it was an illegal act, he said.
He said currently, former President Rajapaksa had 103 police officers and 103 military personnel totaling to 206 in his security contingent. Another contingent of 50 police officers have been deployed for him recently in order to remove 50 military officers from the security contingent. But those 50 military officers are still with him bringing the total strength 256.
Commenting about former defence secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksas security, Mr. Hettiarachchi said 50 military officers would be removed soon and STF personnel would replace them. (Indika Hewawitharana)

Produce owner of 1000 cc bike in courts: Dy Minister
	
Deputy Mass Media and Parliamentary Affairs Minister Karunaratne Paranawithana today said the police must immediately arrest and produce before courts the owner of the 1000 CC, high powered motor cycle that allegedly hit from behind a jeep belonging to the Megapolis and Western Development Ministry at Rajagiriya on the night of February 28.
Addressing the weekly news briefing at the Information Department yesterday, Mr. Paranawithana said the 999 CC motor cycle bearing registration number WP BAK 2011 was not permitted to use for normal travel on a public highway and the Defence Ministry had given permission to ride it only in motor cycle races. The motor cycle must be transported in another vehicle if it was to be moved from one place to another on a high way because it was illegal to ride it on a public road.
The riding of this high speed motor cycle on a public highway was itself a violation of the Motor Traffic Law. Secondly, it has hit the Ministry jeep from behind which is clearly not a fault of the driver. We have information that the driver has directly driven to the Welikada Police after the two youth who rode the cycle had attempted to attack him. I do not know whether the police had already arrested the owner of the motor cycle. If not they must arrest him or her for letting the two youth to ride this motor cycle illegally and risking the lives of road users, Mr. Paranawithana stressed.
He lamented that the media did not give the correct picture of this accident and certain bankrupt politicians had used it to sling mud at Minister Ranawaka and added he had become a victim of irresponsible and bias media that reported only the one side of of the story and bankrupt and malicious politicians who had a personal vendetta on Minister Ranawaka.
The government or Minister Ranawaka had never attempted influence the police investigation and minister Ranawaka had even refused to hold a media conference to explain the truth because the matter was now before courts.
A group of bankrupt and spineless politicians have handed over a no confidence motion against Minister Ranawaka over this accident. It is not on an allegation on his character and performance or policies. This no confidence motion has been handed over to the Speaker on personal hatred on Minister Ranawaka. The government is ready to face not one or two no confidence motions but hundred presented by this bankrupt joint opposition members, Mr. Paranawithana added.(Sandun Jayasekara)

Wijeyadasa, Fonseka flare up in Cabinet
	
Ministers Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe and Sarath Fonseka had a heated argument at the Cabinet meeting yesterday, when the latter accused of former for violating a collective agreement of the Cabinet of Ministers.
According to sources, the altercation had taken place when Field Marshal Fonseka objected to the action of Mr. Rajapakshe in tendering an apology to a Buddhist monk over a statement made by Field Marshal Fonseka in Parliament recently.
I made a statement in Parliament where I referred to a statement made by a monk. I referred to this statement as I wanted to disclose who is going behind the Rajapaksas. But one minister of the Cabinet is violating the collective agreement of the Cabinet of Ministers. We want to safeguard the government, but some are still going behind the Rajapaksas, Minister Fonseka had told President Maithripala Sirisena.
Mr. Rajapakshe had immediately responded by saying it was he who had tendered the apology.
I tendered an apology as the Prime Minister or the President would otherwise have had to do so, on behalf of the government, as it is not possible to run a government without the support of the Buddhist monks, he said.
President Sirisena had then intervened and calmed both ministers down, saying the views of both of them were important. (Ranjan Kasthuri)
