Project Little Hearts: Helping the  Newly-Born to Live
	
Little Hearts Project is a dream with the mission and vision of securing the ability to treat up to 10,000 children every year. This is a project to construct and commission a 10-storied Cardiac and Critical Care Complex at the premises of the Lady Ridgeway Hospital for children (LRH) at Borella.
This is the premier National Hospital, which treats children under 12 years of age, free of charge.
It is estimated that there are about 3,000 children born with congenital hearts diseases and other serious
heart ailments.
According to Dr. Duminda Samarasinghe, Consultant Paediatric Cardiologist, only some 100 cardiac surgeries and 700 catheter-based interventions are done every year. Surgeries are prolonged when considering the need for multiple surgeries for the same patient.
The target is to perform 2,000 surgeries and 1,000 catheter based interventions.
As the LRH has more than 900 beds, the percentage of ICU beds available is 1-2 %. This is grossly inadequate while more than 60% of requests made are rejected and critically ill patients are forced to be treated in general wards, which lack ICU beds  posing a risk for the lives of the little children. It is estimated that some 1,000 to 1,500 children with heart disease and critical illnesses are lost every year. Eight out of 1,000 newly-born leave this world before their 1st birthday. His or Her chance of survival is less than 50% according to hospital sources.
A request is made to all citizens, media and religious organizations to promote and find funds for this project in the shortest possible time. The target to complete the complex is Rs.2,000 billion.
As citizens of Sri Lanka who reap the benefits of free healthcare it is our responsibility to find the funds needed to save our children, who do not have a voice that could be heard.
They are our future generation, who need our attention and help. 
All administrative costs will be borne by well-wishers and guardians of this project and all contributions are Tax-Free. 
Every cent and every rupee counts, is the plea of Little Hearts Project Chairperson Dr. Duminda Samarasinghe. Contact the LRH hot line: 071-644-1122 for further information.
This is not a project for somebody else. Take it as your own project for your own child because it may be the reality one day. An extraordinary event that needs extraordinary support.

Rains, gale force winds wreck havoc in Colombo
	
Hurricane style gale force winds accompanied by torrential rain wrecked havoc in the City of Colombo this evening ripping out trees and causing power disruptions in many areas of the City and its suburbs. Several trees were seen to have fallen on vehicles as well as public property as a result.
The weather conditions started to worsen at about 9 pm today and many parts of the country felt the brute force of mother nature including many parts of the Western Province and the coastal areas.
Fallen trees were seen obstructing a number of roads including the Colombo-Kandy Road and several other places including the court complex entrance at Aluth Kade.

Meanwhile, a tree has fallen on to power lines supplying electricity to the Sri Jayawardenapura Hospital cutting off the electricity supply. Power outages were also reported in many parts of the country. It was reported that Galle, Matara and and Ambalangoda were the worst hit with many power outages also being reported.

S.Korea asks SL support to end N.Korea nuclear provocations
	
South Korean President Moon Jae-in has asked for Sri Lanka's support in ending North Korea's nuclear and missile provocations, calling the North's latest missile test staged earlier in the day a grave challenge to global peace, the Korea Herald reported today.
President Moon said he strongly condemn North Korea's reckless provocation that raises tension on the Korean Peninsula and seriously threatens international peace and stability.
Our government will do its utmost to strongly and firmly deal with such provocations to the end together with Sri Lanka and all other countries, he said.
President Moon and President Maithripala Sirisena on Wednesday agreed to further improve bilateral ties, enhance economic and diplomatic cooperation to boost bilateral trade apart from peacefully resolving the North Korean nuclear issue.
The agreement was made during a summit held between the two Presidents at the South Korean presidential office Cheong Wa Dae.
President Moon has expressed gratitude for what he called Sri Lanka's support and cooperation in dealing with the North Korean nuclear issue, Cheong Wa Dae has said in a press release.
According to Cheong Wa Dae pool reports, President Moon has said their government was actively pursuing the New South Policy that seeks to ensure peace and co-prosperity of a joint community through cooperation with Southeast and Southwest Asian countries.
As Sri Lanka is an important partner in our New South Policy, I wish the two countries will pool their wisdom and strength to ensure peace not only in Sri Lanka but also in our entire region, he said.
President Sirisena was quoted as saying Sri Lanka would continue to fully implement UN Security Council sanctions against North Korea.
"Another thing I wish to stress is that Sri Lanka will always support South Korea on both domestic and international issues. I believe what you Mr. President declared in Berlin will contribute greatly to establishing peace on the Korean Peninsula, and I support them," he said.
President Sirisena arrived in Seoulon Tuesday on a three-day state visit. He is the third foreign leader to make a state visit to South Korea since Moon's inauguration.
Wednesday's summit also followed what Cheong Wa Dae called a friendly meeting between the two leaders on Tuesday, when the South Korean president accompanied the Sri Lankan leader on a brief visit to a Buddhist temple in Seoul.
In their first bilateral summit, the two leaders noted their countries' relationship has steadily developed over the last four decades since they established diplomatic ties in 1977 and agreed to continue building their cooperative relationship as partners for peace and prosperity.
To this end, the leaders agreed to increase exchanges between their ranking government officials and boost cooperation in the defense industry.
According to Cheong Wa Dae, Seoul would also increase its low-interest loans to Sri Lanka under its Economic Development Cooperation Fund to US$500 million from the current $300 million in the 2017-2019 period.
In addition, the two leaders agreed to work together to make sure Sri Lankan workers in South Korea under the country's Employment Permit System will serve as a bridge between the two countries, and expand the countries' exchanges in the cultural and tourism sectors," it said noting there were currently around 30,000 Sri Lankan workers in South Korea.

Thisara Perera named ODI and T20 captain
	
All-rounder Thisara Perera will take over as Sri Lanka's ODI captain from the upcoming three-match series against India. Perera will also lead the side in the three-match Twenty20 International series.
The 28-year-old will take over from opening batsman Upul Tharanga under whose captaincy Sri Lanka suffered three 5-0 whitewashes this year.
When Angelo Mathews stepped down as captain in July this year, the captaincy was split and Tharanga was handed the ODI mantle while Dinesh Chandimal took over as Test captain.
Given Tharanga's reserved nature, Sanath Jayasuriya's decision to elevate his former opening partner as captain surprised many although he has been in prolific form this year having amassed over 800 runs in 22 ODIs at an average of 47 with two centuries and five half-centuries.
Apart from suffering whitewashes at the hands of South Africa, India and Pakistan this year, that threatened automatic qualification for the 2019 World Cup, Tharanga also got into trouble twice due to slow over rates and was suspended.
Last month, he opted out of playing the third and final T20I against Pakistan in Lahore, which brought in Perera as Sri Lanka's captain for the three-match series as Sri Lanka Cricket refused to name separate squads for the UAE leg and the Lahore game.
Cricbuzz reported that the selectors looked at various options but eventually settled in for Perera. The manner in which Perera brought the side together during the T20 series seems to have impressed the selectors although an under-strength Sri Lankan side were whitewashed 3-0 by Pakistan.
There were discussions to hand back the ODI captaincy to Mathews, but his constant struggles with injuries ruled him out. The name of Dinesh Chandimal was also discussed, but the Test captain has struggled in recent ODIs having been surprisingly axed for the home series against Zimbabwe.(Cricbuzz)

Chaos as 120,000 tourists are stranded as volcano Mount Agung continues to erupt
	

As many as 120,000 tourists have been stranded in Bali by the ongoing eruption of Mount Agung, with some put on flights leaving after Christmas.
The holiday islands airport remains shut for at least another 24 hours due to clouds of ash billowing from the volcano.
Todays extension of the airport closure means more than 900 flights have now been cancelled, leaving tens of thousands of travellers unable to leave Bali. Up to 100,000 villagers were told to move into evacuation shelters as a cloud of volcanic ash reached three kilometres into the air.
Indonesian volcanologist Gede Suantika said lava was building up inside Mount Agung and would spill over when it reached the edge.
That would result in a slow flow of red hot lava, but the volcanos steepness could lead to a more powerful eruption.
The pyroclastic flow from the 1963 eruption killed 1600, and authorities in Bali are preparing for the worst.
Cold lava flows, known as lahar, have already flooded the rivers and canals of nearby villages, but many locals ignoring warnings to leave the area.

Commercial Credit also places immense value on all employees who are treated with respect. In order to develop them on a regular basis, Commercial Credit invests heavily in trainings and also plans to invest in building a state-of-the-art residential training centre in the near future.

The budget proposal to open up the shipping industry with the objective of attracting major players to invest in Sri Lanka would not serve any purpose as global players are already engaged in business in the country, joint opposition MP Rohitha Abeygunawardene said yesterday.
Global players in the shipping industry are already in Sri Lanka and the proposal to remove the laws which restrict the stake a foreign player could hold in a shipping agency in Sri Lanka to 40% will not serve any purpose. Name a foreign shipping company that has not come to Sri Lanka," he said speaking during the committee stage debate in Parliament yesterday.
The MP said the former government also brought a similar proposal to open up the shipping industry but decided to give it up after discussions with local shipping agencies.
A shipping agency in Sri Lanka can be opened with an investment of Rs.5 million. Is the government trying to open the industry to attract investments worth only that much It should instead impose a benchmark for investment," he said and added that prior to introducing this proposal, the Finance Ministry should have discussed this matter with the Ministry of Ports and Shipping.

Good publicity from their suffering
	

In a bid to diffuse the tensions still running high in the Galle area, several purohitas, last week visited the place where violent clashes had broken out.

Some of them, of course, were keen on getting the best possible publicity for their peace-making effort, they say.
Among the VIPs who made it to the area was the wizard of Wilpattu fame. He had planned to go round the area to make an assessment of the damage caused by the violence.
However, a keen disappointment awaited the purohita as he got down from his limousine. There were no media personnel or video crews to place on record his arrival. He was highly upset when he found there were no media people to cover his inspection round either.
Undeterred, the purohita asked one of his aides to video his tour from A to Z on his smart phone. But he suddenly realized the aide was doing the video coverage without a running commentary!
On a sudden brain wave, the purohita took over the job of making the commentary himself while the aide was videoing.
At the end of the day, the purohita did a good video coverage of the misery and suffering that the victims of the violence underwent and posted the footage on the Facebook as well.

Historic boat rots away in  Kurunegala Boat wrecked! Archaeological Artefacts in Ruins
	
The history of a country is part and parcel of its cultures, traditions and identity. This underscores why the remnants of any history that trace us back to the past should be preserved. 
The Daily Mirror received information of a large ancient boat left unprotected in Kurunegala. According to the description on a board relating to this ancient artefact, the boat referred to as a craft, is said to have been discovered on July 20, 2003. The craft was unearthed during excavation carried out in the ancient Kurunegala Lake. The craft is entirely carved of kumbuk, a pristine timber. It is 32 ft in length and 51/2 ft in width. The nature of the craft has led to the belief that it was used by kings belonging to the Kurunegala era. The Kurunegala era is dated from 1293 AD to 1333 AD. According to archaeologists, the craft is said to be 800-900 years old. So this craft is indeed a historically valuable artefact. 
Rotting away
The ancient craft is located at an archaeological open-air museum within the grounds of the office of the Governor of the North Western Province. For its protection, it is encased in a tank-like construction made of glass and concrete. But according to visitors, who paid visits to the museum, the current situation of the tank, inside which the boat is placed, is in a decrepit state. A visitor complained that at first glance, it appeared as a garbage dump. The roof and glass of the construction are now broken, while the remaining glass has been covered with dirt and dust obstructing the view of visitors. He further mentioned that the Kumbuk wood of the boat was covered with lichen. The boat, submerged in water, was said to be rotting away. The visitor pointed out that it was a highly suitable site for breeding mosquitoes. 
We will be removing the algae and cleaning the parts of the boat made of wood. We wanted to retain the boat in its natural form, so we will be submerging it in water
The Daily Mirror inquired into this issue by speaking to Upali Wathuge, Assistant Director of the Chemical Conservation Division, Department of Archaeology. He said he was aware of the issue. We replaced the broken glass of the tank several times, but the glass kept cracking. Normally a historical artifact is preserved either naturally or by chemical means. Usually there are various methods of chemical preservation. This is done by the use of chemicals such as polyethylene glycol or highly concentrated alcohol. But chemical conservation is expensive with regard to the boat because it is a large one. The cost would amount to around rupees 50 lakhs.
This method would also be very time consuming. So we approached a natural method of conservation instead of chemical conservation, he explained. The boat preserved by natural means is submerging in water in a tank made of glass. But the use of glass has proven to be ineffective. The glass has been reported to have broken on several occasions. 
The glass has cracked and broken from time to time. We kept replacing it. We have already started taking decisions regarding the conservation of the boat. So now we plan to replace the glass with concrete and seal it, Wathuge said.
Use of Guppy
It was discussed that the tank would be strengthened with concrete. The concretion will be performed by the Archaeological Department in the North Western Region. Soon after the concretion, we are to be notified. The Chemical Conservation Division will follow up with the preservation steps of the boat, Wathuge stressed. We will be removing the algae and cleaning the parts of the boat made of wood. We wanted to retain the boat in its natural form, so we will be submerging it in water. To prevent the breeding of mosquitoes in the water we will be using guppy fish. Even currently, guppy fish are present in the water in which the boat is submerged. We will be taking steps to ensure that the boat will be preserved for a long period of time. We will take over its conservation as soon as we are notified that the concretion is complete, said the Assistant Director, further explaining the plans for preservation.

This isnt the only ancient boat that is found in the island. We uncovered many other boats of historical importance. We have placed them in various sites. These sites include Kalutara and the Trincomalee museum. We even placed one at the National Museum. That boat is 62-64 ft in length. We havent been able to conserve all of them yet, but we have conserved a few including the one at Trincomalee. We also unearthed an ancient boat at Kukuleganga which we have conserved. We are hoping to conserve the rest either using natural or chemical methods. Conservation procedures take time, he concluded. 
It was discussed that the tank would be strengthened with concrete. The concretion will be performed by the Archaeological Department in the North Western Region.
Contacting the Kelaniya Regional Office of the Archaeological Department, the Daily Mirror inquired about the progress it plans to concrete the tank in which the boat is placed. An official said that the reason for the tank to be in disrepair is due to the heavy branches of surrounding trees collapsing on the tank and causing damages. The concrete of the tank had cracked and glass left broken. The Daily Mirror was informed that the preparations of concretion are underway. The concretion will start soon. The concretion is to be guided under expert and specialist instructions.

HNB launches Asias first fitness-linked savings product
	
Seeking to meaningfully enhance lifestyles leveraging new technologies, Sri Lankas most digitally innovative bank, HNB PLC, announced the launch of HNB FIT savings accounts, a trailblazing new product that enables customers to save more simply by exercising more.
A first in the Asian region, the HNB FIT savings account essentially works by using fitness trackers to measure the number of steps a customer takes each day, and based on how many steps they take, provide customers with a daily incentive on their basic interest rate of up to 10 percent per annum.
As a result, customers who are able to take over 6,000 steps a day will receive an incentive interest rate of eight percent per annum for that day, while customers who take in excess of 10,000 steps will receive an outstanding interest rate of 10 percent.
Im sure many of us can relate to the difficulty of not just starting, but actually maintaining a regular exercise routine. Especially in todays fast-paced, digitally-driven world, it is often difficult for us to strike a balance between our personal, professional and social lives. Yet it is precisely for that reason personal health and wellness takes on an increasingly important role. With the launch of HNB FIT Savings Accounts, our goal is to help our customers to more easily achieve this balance by adding what we feel has been the missing ingredient  incentive. FIT stands for: Fitness, Interest and Technology. By merging these three ingredients, we have created a path for those who dedicate themselves to a target to immediately receive tangible benefits in the form of significantly increased savings. In that regard we are confident that we can inspire and empower our customers to take control of their fitness and make their lifestyles work for them, HNB Managing Director/CEO Jonathan Alles said.
While fitness trackers have been available since the early 2000s, it was only with the more recent advent of affordable devices featuring greater connectivity devices such as the FitBit, Apple Watch and Jawbone UP devices have begun to achieve commercial popularity both internationally and in Sri Lanka.
The rising popularity of such devices can also be tied to a growing fitness and wellness culture in Sri Lanka according to HNB DepositsSenior Manager Viranga Gamage. With the opening up of public spaces across the country where people can now go to exercise, and a rising per capita income, Sri Lankans of all ages are becoming more aware of the need to balance their work and their recreation with healthy eating and regular exercise. In that regard, the launch of HNB FIT has been timed to capitalise on the emergence of these trends, and also to add greater momentum to them in order to be more physically and financially secure. The days of walking for free are now over, in the best possible way, he asserted.
Adding further support to the launch of HNB FIT savings account, the bank also announced that it had partnered with leading local e-commerce platform, wow.lk to offer exclusive discounts on selected fitness devices. Further, any purchase of these devices made through a HNB credit card could be converted into a six or 12-month installment plan at zero percent interest with discounts of up to five percent.

In search of patients with  serious ailments
	
There are pros and cons of both Ayurvedic and Western medicinal practices. Many assume that the Ayurvedic system is unique to Sri Lanka. Simply the reality is that the existing Sri Lankan Ayurvedic system was influenced by the Indian Ayurvedic system. Before the Ayurvedic system spread, a traditional and indigenous medical practice existed in Sri Lanka. This purely Sri Lankan medical practice isnt a descendant of Indian Ayurvedic system, traditional medical practitioner Dampe Weda Mahaththaya told the Daily Mirror. 
This Ayurvedic doctor, from Madapatha, Dampe, said that the traditional indigenous medical practice is deep-rooted in theSri Lankan history. 
Prefers treating serious patients 
Speaking about the specialized areas in Ayurveda he said, I am dedicated towards curing the poorest of patients who are suffering from diseases which have been termed incurable. Among them are patients who have been told to undergo bypass operations. I prefer to treat patients who have serious ailments since any doctor can cure simple illnesses likes coughs and influenza. I am interested in curing patients with Diabetics, Arthritis, High/low blood pressure, cholesterol and wheezing, said Dampe Weda Mahaththaya.  Answering the question as to how he entered the field of medicine, the weda mahaththaya said, Well, I am hailing from an ancient weda (Medicinal) generation whose roots are in Anuradhapura. We have been familiar with medicine and treatments since childhood. As children, we would go searching for medicine in the forest with our elders. 
Later I met an elderly weda mahaththaya from Ratnapura, who had no predecessor to pass on his vast knowledge to. He taught me the art of <U+200D><U+200D><U+200D><U+200D><U+200D><U+200D>pulse reading known as Naadi Wedakama<U+200D><U+200D><U+200D>. Therefore I am skilled in a medicinal practice known as Sanyoga Wedakama which I inherited from the family. This method of treatment has pulse reading incorporated into it. Pulse reading is based on temperature and the activeness of the patient, the weda mahattaya said. According to him in latter years his family had moved to Madapatha. After settling down, we were treating the villagers and soon patients came in numbers and formed queues at our residence. Our home was always filled with patients, he reminisced. 
Every plant contains poisons within. The indigenous medical practitioner, also known as weda mahaththya, has the ability to mix the poison in safer quantities so that it cures the patient
Lack of herbs and plants 
Making medicine from plants and herbs at present is a difficult task for Ayurvedic doctors like him due to lack of material. He explained how he is overcoming such difficulties. I can identify any medicinal plant just by biting into a dried-up part of a tree, which grows in this country. Now the forests are degrading fast, and its difficult to find herbs needed for medicine. Mahogany, Teak and other invasive plant species are destroying our indigenous trees and plants and also disturbing the pollination process. The bees, a critical part of pollination and the forest life cycle, are going extinct. Thousands of trees are facing the threat of extinction. is how he described the present precarious situation. 
We usually obtain herbs from Anuradhapura, Vavuniya, Mulathivu, and Polonnaruwa. We obtain them especially from the dry zone. We have helping hands everywhere in the country. They collect and bring the medicinal herbs which we combine carefully to produce the medicines, ourselves. My family members support us in all these endeavours. he noted. 
Every plant contains poisons within. The indigenous medical practitioner, also known as weda mahaththya, has the ability to mix the poison in safer quantities so that it cures the patient, he specified. 
He said that a doctor is responsible in prescribing the right medication for a patient. He added that regardless of whether the ailment was simple or complicated prescribing any medicine should be done with a great understanding of the patients condition. Its essential that the doctor has a clear sense of the three ailments afflicting a patient which are identified in Ayruveda as Thridosha, (waatha, pitha, and sema), he said. 
Bypass
We asked the weda mahaththaya why he started treating patients who have been recommended to undergo bypass surgery. Well, I had the idea to make medicines for patients who have been told to do a bypass surgery. I started experimenting with medicines which can be used to cure such ailments. This was early as in 2001. My experiments produced successful results by 2005. As a result, we are able to cure any patient who has been told to undergo bypass surgery within two and half months, he said.
Many people think that indigenous medicine and Ayurvedic medicine are the same. Dampe Weda Mahaththaya explained the differences between those two medicinal practices. The Ayurvedic system came to Sri Lanka from India and later mixed with traditional indigenous medicine that was existing. Consequently, the Ayurvedic medical practice surpassed the practice of traditional indigenous medicine. Concoctions, dry balls, arishta (syrup) and other medications are given to the patient in the Ayurvedic system. However, in traditional indigenous medicine practice, we give only the dry version of medicines taking into account convenience and practicality. Both medical practices have transparent differences he said.
However, in traditional indigenous medicine, almost all plants and leaves are used to make medicine. We combine the barks, leaves, fruits, roots and other natural substances and use our knowledge to experiment with new medicines and treatment. Thats the most obvious difference between the two systems. They (Ayurvedic) cant find solutions for new diseases, but we (Traditionalists) can,he emphasised.
The wonder of this traditional indigenous medical practice is that there are treatments for every disease and we can find treatment for newly originated diseases, even for plagues. It is possible to make medicines by experimenting
No miracle oils
Airing his opinion on quack doctors or so-called weda mahaththayas and the harm done by them to this practice known as wedakama he said, Nowadays, there are hundreds of Sinhala medicinal products manufactured for the sole purpose of marketing. There are no common medicines in the traditional indigenous medical practice that can be given to everyone except for herbs like Kottamalli, Aralu, Bulu, and Nelli etc. Those various oils, that promise miracles and cures, are mere consumer products since no genuine weda mahaththaya can make cure-all oils.
The first thing a general physician does is to reveal the bitter truth about a serious illness to the patient. This causes a major mental break down in the patient. As doctors, we should cultivate a friendship with the patient and utter words of encouragement. Not only the body, but also the mind of the patient needs care. he said underscoring how the traditional indigenous medical practice is bound not only with the physical self, but also with the spiritual self of a patient. 
Asked what the taboo foods are from a traditional indigenous medicine perspective, he said, It depends on the disease and the condition of the patient. Pineapples, tomatoes, fish and meat are considered taboo in Sinhala wedakama. I advise my patients to avoid these food and ask them to consider avoiding foods that raise the heat in the body. Fish contains formalin and are months old and meat also includes certain hormones that are detrimental to my mode of treatment. Speaking about the diseases, Dampe Weda Mahaththaya said that the traditional indigenous medicine is a vast subject. The wonder of this traditional indigenous medical practice is that there are treatments for every disease and we can find treatment for newly originated diseases, even for plagues. It is possible to make medicines by experimenting, he said.

Kenyatta sworn in for second term
	

AFP, 28 November, 2017- Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta was sworn in Tuesday for a second term, but his vow to heal the countrys divisions was overshadowed by violent protests and a pledge from his rival to stage his own inauguration. 
Kenyas schisms after a gruelling election period were on full display on the very first day of Kenyattas second five-year term. 
The pomp of his inauguration ceremony contrasted with clouds of teargas fired at opposition leader Raila Odinga and his supporters as they attempted to rally elsewhere in Nairobi. At least one person died in the clashes. 
Throwing down the gauntlet, Odinga rejected Kenyattas inauguration and vowed to hold his own swearing-in on December 12, the day the country marks its independence from Britain. 
I will be sworn in because I am the legitimate president, he said. 
Odingas supporters engaged in running battles with police all morning as they attempted to gather for a memorial rally to honour more than 50 people killed, mostly by police, in over four months of political upheaval.

Kim Jong Nams underwear soiled, pupils contracted:Doctor
	

SHAH ALAM, Malaysia, (The Washington Post/AP),November 27 2017  
A Malaysian doctor testified Monday at the trial of two young women accused of murdering the estranged half brother of North Koreas leader that the victims pupils contracted and his underwear was soiled with feces, both signs of poisoning.
Siti Aisyah of Indonesia and Doan Thi Huong of Vietnam, the only suspects in custody, pleaded not guilty at the start of their trial on Oct. 2. They were accused of smearing the banned VX nerve agent on Kim Jong Nams face at a crowded airport terminal in Kuala Lumpur on Feb. 13, killing him within two hours.
Nurliza Abdullah, one of two government doctors who conducted the autopsy on Kims body, told the court that the pupil constriction and the large amount of excrement found in Kims underwear both pointed to poisoning.
Based on our autopsy and the lab test results, the cause of death is acute nerve agent VX poisoning, she said, concurring with a colleague who had given similar testimony earlier in the trial, when the autopsy report was presented to the court. Nurliza, however, agreed with the defense assertion that the post-mortem alone wasnt able to confirm VX as the cause of death, and that the autopsy conclusion was based on tests by the chemical department that found traces of the nerve agent on Kims face and body.
Mondays court session was cut short because the next prosecution witness wasnt ready. The trial will resume Tuesday.

Lankan woman fatally stabbed in Staten Island, US
	
A Sri Lankan born 63-year-old woman identified as Geetha Howie was killed when she was stabbed in Staten Island, US on Monday, CBS News reported today.
Police said a 27-year-old Dantey Moore faces charges of murder, assault and criminal possession of a weapon in the death of the victim.
They say despite having no known gang affiliation, Moore has a history of violence and drug use and 34 prior arrests.
However, the suspect had denied committing the crime when he was approached by CBS2s Reena Roy. I didnt do it, he said.
A brother of the suspect has told CBS2 that Moore sometimes smoked angel dust, but he couldnt tell if Moore had smoked or been high Monday around the time of the incident.
Relatives of the victim said she had just left the bank after 2 p.m. Monday when she was confronted by the suspect just two blocks from her home.
A neighbor, Mark Long, was the first person to hear Howies screams as she struggled with the suspect.
Police sources say when officers got the scene, Moore was cradling Howie in his arms.
Victims son-in-law Daniel Fazzina said Howie was adored by her loved ones. Their family had been preparing to travel to Sri Lanka for a relatives wedding.
She loved her family. We have a 3-year-old daughter, her granddaughter, who she absolutely loved. They were inseparable. This is a senseless tragedy, Fazzina said.
Siri Katugampala, a family friend, said Ms. Howie was a good person. Youre walking on the street and something like this happens. Who would expect something like that Its sad, he said.
Cops who made the arrest told CBS2 they are very familiar with Moore. This was his 35th arrest.

Mass Chinese wedding for 100 couples  in SL
	
An international mass wedding involving 100 young Chinese couples, planned as a tourism promotion event to showcase the countrys rich culture will be held in Sri Lanka on December 17, Megapolis and Western Development Minister Champika Ranawaka said.
Minister Ranawaka told the media yesterday that the mass wedding ceremony will further strengthen the cultural, religious and trade links between the two countries that run to early historic times and act as a big boost to tourism promotion in Sri Lanka.
This event is a turning point of Sri Lanka  China relations. One of the prominent couples that would enter the wedlock among the 100 is a great-great-grand-son of a Sinhala prince who was abducted and taken to China during the Kotte dynasty. There are several descendants from this Sinhala prince in China today. The bride is one of them, Minister Ranawaka said.
President Maithripala Sirisena will be participating in the wedding ceremony as an attesting witness to a few couples and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe will also attend the event.
The main wedding ceremony will be held at the Viharamahadevi Park and a reception at the Waters Edge Hotel at Battaramulla.
The newly-wed couples will leave that afternoon for their honeymoon at ancient cities like Anuradhapura, Polonnaruwa and wildlife sanctuaries like Yala. On December 22 there will be a special ceremony at the Waters Edge for them before leaving for China.
Tourism Promotion and Christian Affairs Minister John Amaratunga said his ministry, Megapolis and Western Development Ministry, a number of Chinese tourism and public relation promotion companies, Colombo Municipal Council and Sri Lanka embassy in Beijing are the sponsors of this grand wedding ceremony.
No one can provide this diversity and facilities better than Sri Lanka in the region. We hope to make this an annual event and also to woo other countries to follow suit and organize this kind of events in Sri Lanka, Minister Amaratunga said. (Sandun A Jayasekera)

Minister keen to protect local players
	
Ports and Shipping Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe said yesterday he was opposed to the budget proposal which opens the shipping industry to international players.
He stressed the need for the Finance Ministry to discuss this proposal with the shipping ministry before implementing it.
The minister who took part in the committee stage debate on the budget said opening of the shipping industry would affect the local players in the industry.
"I am opposed to this proposal as a member of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) which is committed to safeguarding local entrepreneurs," he said and added that even President Maithripala Sirisena was of the view that the local players should be safeguarded.
However, the minister said international investors should be allowed to enter the shipping industry subject to conditions while bring in a prescribed amount of investments.
"However, we are confident that the Finance Minister will look into this matter and make the necessary amendments to the budget proposal," the minister said.
Responding to an allegation made by joint opposition MP Sriyani Wijewickrama that the Hambantota Port Deal was not beneficial to the country, the minister said he managed to convert it into an agreement beneficial to Sri Lanka. He said arrangements had to be made to repay the commercial loan taken by the previous regime to construct the Hambantota Port. (Yohan Perera and Ajith Siriwardana)

A story gone viral in political circles says that the Blue partys incumbent secretarial one is likely to be replaced by a much senior one in the near future.

Most Blue party front-liners are not happy with the incumbent ones performance and they welcome a replacement, they say. Meanwhile, the JO is also pressing that if they are to return to the fold, there should be a secretarial one whom they could be comfortable with.
All indications are that a senior purohita, hailing from the Colombo district, who had been close to the JO all along, may succeed the young one now holding the key post.

North Korea 'tested new long-range missile' that can reach US
	
North Korea says it has successfully tested a new type of intercontinental ballistic missile that can reach the whole of continental US.
State television claimed that Pyongyang had now achieved its mission of becoming a nuclear state.
The Hwasong-15 missile, which it said was its "most powerful", was launched in darkness early on Wednesday.
It landed in Japanese waters but flew higher than any other missile the North has previously tested.
State news agency KCNA said that the missile reached an altitude of 4,475km (2,780 miles) and flew 950km for 53 minutes.
It added that North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, who personally signed off on the launch, "declared with pride that now we have finally realised the great historic cause of completing the state nuclear force, the cause of building a rocket power".
Japanese officials said the projectile did not fly over Japan, as some have done in the past, and landed about 250km off its northern coast.
The test has prompted swift international condemnation. The UN Security Council is due to convene an emergency session to discuss the latest test.
The launch was the latest in a series of weapons tests that raised tensions to unprecedented levels. Pyongyang last launched a ballistic missile in September, the same month it conducted its sixth nuclear test.
North Korea has continued to develop its nuclear and missile programme despite this global condemnation and sanctions.
Prior to North Korea's, US defence secretary James Mattis said the missile launch "went higher, frankly, than any previous shots they have taken", and said North Korea poses a worldwide threat.
US President Donald Trump was briefed while the missile was still in the air, the White House said. Afterwards he said: "We will take care of it."
Japan and South Korea have condemned the test, with the South launching its own missile test in response.(BBC)

Our politicos are giving deities a busy time
	

If the pantheon of deities in our neighbouring country were to give ear to the supplications of our leading politicos who are visiting the Kovils dedicated to them these days, they would surely have no time to look into the woes of the people in their own country.

It was only a few days ago the people here heard that their Number Two was conducting a pooja at a Kovil in Mysore. Soon after, a news story said that King Rooster from the estate-kingdom had pitched camp at a Kovil in Karnataka for a multi-day pooja. Meanwhile, reports said that his main political rival Deega was visiting Tamil Nadu to seek the blessings of deities at several Kovils in that state. The next on the list to join the Indian Kovil-bound parade from Mother Lanka are two or three devotees from the JO, they say.
Another devotee due to visit India shortly is none other than the chair of our Diyawanna council who will be on a pilgrimage to Deekshabhoomi in Nagpur, the birthplace of Ambedkar-led Buddhist revival
in India.

Pope sidesteps Rohingya crisis in Myanmar address
	

AFP, 28 November, 2017- Pope Francis called for respect for rights and justice in a keenly-watched address in Myanmar on Tuesday, but refrained from any mention of the Rohingya or the alleged ethnic cleansing that has driven huge numbers of the Muslim minority from the country. 
Sharing a stage with Myanmars leader Aung San Suu Kyi in the capital Naypyidaw, he did not address the Rohingya crisis head-on but instead tip-toed around the unfolding humanitarian emergency. 
Peace can only be achieved through justice and a respect for human rights, he said in a broadly-framed speech that also called for respect for each ethnic group and its identity. 
The word Rohingya, an incendiary term in a mainly Buddhist country where the Muslim minority are denied citizenship and branded illegal Bengali immigrants, was entirely absent from his speech. 
Francis has repeatedly defended the group, some 620,000 of whom have fled from Myanmars Rakhine state to Bangladesh since August.

Prank played on a foreign visitor
	

This happened some time ago.

The former chief of our metropolis was on his way to a destination in Fort along with a foreign visitor. While riding past the Galle Face Green, the foreign visitors watchful eye caught a hotel complex and the landmark Bandaranaike statue opposite it.
Whose statue is this the foreign visitor asked Colombos former first citizen.
The Sri Lankan host who wanted to give a dead rope to the foreign guest told him: O! Its Shangri-La statue!
The foreign visitor had later told several friends of his about the Shangri-La statue facing the sea opposite the picturesque Galle face Green!
The Number One who had come to hear all about how the former city chief had taken the foreign visitor for a ride had later checked the veracity of the story about the prank from its author himself.
Later sharing the joke with his Top team colleagues he had declared in jest: I exiled him from the country as punishment for this offence, adding, Of course, in the capacity of an ambassador!
