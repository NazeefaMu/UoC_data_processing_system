Only two MPs drafted new Constitution: Dayasiri
	
Opposition today charged that two MPs namely M. A. Sumanthiran and Jayampathi Wickramaratne had carried out a conspiracy to prepare the draft for a new Constitution without engaging the Expert Panel, which had been appointed to do so.
Opposition MP Dayasiri Jayasekera, who raised the matter in Parliament this morning, said it was revealed at the Constitutional Assembly Steering Committee meeting last Wednesday that a draft of the new Constitution has been prepared by two MPs, namely M. A Sumanthiran and Jayampathi Wickramaratne together with another member of the expert panel Suren Fernando and had got the other members to sign it.
He said only four members have placed their signatures on it.
This draft has proposed that provisions should be provided for the Prime Minister, the Speaker and the Leader of Opposition to remove President. This is a dangerous move, Mr Jayasekera said.
Joint Opposition MP Mahindananda Aluthgamage said one of the four members, who had placed his signature to the draft, had not visited Sri Lanka for the last six months.
One signature placed on the draft is a forged one, he said.
Chief Opposition Whip Anura Kumara Dissanayake, also confirmed the issue and said what was presented to the Steering Committee was a paper for discussion.
However, he said it was re-referred to the Expert Panel in order to be amended.
The paper was rejected as it has been prepared by two or three individuals, he said.
Joint Opposition Parliamentary Group Leader Dinesh Gunawardane said even the Prime Minister has not been aware of this move.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe was also not aware of this move and therefore he too had to agree to reject the paper, Mr Gunawardane said.
He said this is a move to convert Sri Lanka into a Federal State.
Minister Kabir Hashim and Gayantha Karunathilaka said there was no issue as the draft paper would be amended and would be prepared once again.
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya said he would discuss the matter with the Prime Minister. (Yohan Perera and Ajith Siriwardana)

PMs office condemns threats against HRC Chairperson
	
The Prime Ministers Office today strongly condemned the malicious statements made against Sri Lanka Human Rights Commission's Chairperson Dr Deepika Udagama and said it had instructed the Police Chief to launch an investigation in this regard.
Issuing a statement, the office said the Human Rights Commission (HRC), which was appointed in line with the Constitution of Sri Lanka, was an entity which functioned independently.
"It is a serious issue to publicly threaten the HRC's Chairperson and also to highlight such irresponsible statements on print media. The Police Chief had been instructed to ensure the safety of the HRC Chairperson and its Commissioners," the Statement said.

Pragna Pradeepa Concept focuses on womens welfare
	
Jayantha De Silva at the certificate awarding ceremony

Member of the Western Provincial Council Jayantha De Silva, who expressed concern over the countrys failure to manage female labour, pointed out that the agriculture based economy that existed about sixty years ago had given pride of place to woman. 
De Silva made these comments when addressing a ceremony where certificates were awarded to a group of 40 women of low income families. The group successfully completed the Beauticians Course conducted under the Pragna Pradeepa Concept. He pointed out that woman in the past had played an important role when the economy depended largely on traditional agriculture. 
The world today is entirely different from that of the past. Today any area of economy is interwoven with knowledge and professional skills. Vast new fields have been opened up for individuals who have undergone vocational training and possess professional skills in some trade or the other. However, its a matter of serious concern that women in the country are facing hardship for want of an effective mechanism for them to gain professional skills in a field of their choices,he said.
Thousands of unskilled women have been provided with employment in the Middle East. They face hardship, clash with the employers and quite often die. There is much sorrow in their families when they receive such information. Pragna Pradeepa Concept focuses its attention on the predicament of women going abroad in search of employment without adequate training. This is why Pragna Pradeepa Concept implemented a scheme to provide them with a professional training. A group of 40 women have completed the Beauticians Course and received a recognized certificate,added De Silva.
They will be able to supplement their family income through self-employment or to find employment abroad. Its a laborious task to maintain a family at present. The cost of food, clothes, medical treatment, medicine and the childrens education have been increasing in leaps and bounds. The woman who followed the beauticians course will be able to supplement the family economy through self-employment. It is very important that they make use of their training and practise their trade or else possessing a certificate alone would not serve any purpose, provincial councillor said.
Zonal Director of Education R. Wijesinghe, Training Consultant Sumitra Nicholas, Secretary of the Pragna Pradeepa Concept Deshabandu A. Sumith Perera and several MMCs were present at the occasion.

## Title: Regi Siriwardena:  Towards the Ithaca of my pen

Regi Siriwardena:  Towards the Ithaca of my pen
	
Tissa Abeysekara knew Regi Siriwardena. It was Regi who inducted Tissa into the cinema, when, aboard Lester James Periess Gamperaliya, he pointed at him and suggested that he write the
dialogues for the script. This was reasonable, given that neither Regi nor Tissa was adequate to the task of writing in Sinhala. In any case, two days after the suggestion was made and approved, Tissa went to meet his benefactor at his residence in Elibank Road, along Havelock Town, where for hours and hours, the two talked about Chitrasena and Dylan Thomas. As the day drew to its end though, Tissa suddenly remembered that he was expected to be present at a LSSP Youth League in his hometown, Egodawatta, for the simple reason that he was its Secretary. The rift between Dylan Thomas and revolutionary politics, for Tissa at least, seemed virtually unbridgeable, so it was with some hesitation that he excused himself. 
The reply he got was beyond what he expected; his benefactor had not only been in the LSSP, he had also been in the Central Committee during the Second World War. For me, Tissa reflected later, this was a bombshell. Literature, for him, had seen quite out of line with the permanent revolution. I realise this to be the result of my own immaturity, my inability... to understand the real nature of the Party, he added. 
The rift between art and politics has been pored over so much that examining it in this space is well beyond my abilities. In any case, an essay on Regi Siriwardena should not indulge in such polemics, for the simple reason that they arent really relevant. Regis life raises so many other questions, much of which delve into why, and how, writing in English paled away in this country and with it the golden era of journalism, the era that bred not just Regi, but also Mervyn de Silva, Godfrey Gunatilleke, and the later generation of Gamini Haththotuwegama and Ajith Samaranayake (both of whom were proficient equally in Sinhala and English). Things were different to how they are now, yes. And yet, information was not easily accessible back then and to be a great writer, or even a good one, you had to do the hard yards. With the proliferation of tuition classes and the recognition of the importance of teaching English our way (a proposition I view with mixed feelings), such writers should surely not be hard to get now. But a perusal of our newspapers would prove that, contrary to what youd expect, standards have gone tumbling down. In other societies, there is a positive relationship between information accessibility and language standards. Here, there appears to be an inverse relationship. And for all the wrong reasons; its like buying an expensive sedan without the engine inside. We idolise English, yet cant seem to make use of it. 

In other societies, there is a positive relationship between information accessibility and language standards

Malinda Seneviratne, in a thoughtful essay titled And it all began with Sinhala Only, okay (rather tongue-in-cheek, I should think), contends against the notion that at the centre of the ethnic turmoil we are facing now lies the infamous Sinhala Only Act, passed in 1956. As far as political arguments go, Sinhala Only cannot be faulted for being the only reason, or even the main reason (though it was a reason alright). I am not so sure, however, whether it was not the main such reason for the way we seem to have regressed in language, be it Sinhala or English. After all, our cultural spheres seem to be populated by announcers, debaters, and writers who cant handle either language and perpetuate errors that would have been frowned upon back in the day. 

Coomaraswamy and Maurice

In any case, lets get back to Regi Siriwardena. Regi was not, as his writings make it manifestly clear, a believer in monoliths, be it in politics or the arts. When Professor H. L. Seneviratne in The Work of Kings suggested that the post-1956 cultural renaissance produced nothing of any significant value, he was quick to point out that this was a false argument (Is everything innovative and creative in Sinhala literature, theatre, film, and music... to be written off as worthless).

With the proliferation of tuition classes and the recognition of the importance of teaching English our way (a proposition I view with mixed feelings), such writers should surely not be hard to get now

When he assessed Ananda Coomaraswamy, he did not hesitate to compare and contrast the man with another polymath, William Morris, on the basis that while Morris looked forward to a socialist and humanist society, Coomaraswamy looked backward to a society where structures and hierarchies of power would hold sway unquestioned, which led him to idealise Brahmanical caste structures as the only true communism. And when Ediriweera Sarachchandra, whose Maname was reviewed for the first time in English by Regi, went on a theatrical crusade against J. R. Jayewardene with his play Vessantara, the ardent critic, while opposing the Jayewardene regime, did not take ideological persuasion as an excuse to exculpate what he felt to be the flaws of the production. 

Rare critic

For Regi was that rare critic, the sort who did not limit himself to the language he operated in. Today no one bothers reviewing a Sinhala or Tamil play in English, and today no one bothers writing in Sinhala or Tamil on artists whose contributions have taken them beyond the confines of the Sinhala and Tamil homeland. It is perhaps for this reason that we havent had many writers who have written in both English and Sinhala. Barring Sarachchandra, who translated a couple of his books into English, and Martin Wickramasinghe and Gunadasa Amarasekara, whose writings in English were limited to more theoretical fields (mainly in politics and cultural polemics), no writer from their generation accessed both the English and vernacular readership. It was for this reason that critics were needed, badly, and back then more than now, and it was because of these critics that the cultural renaissance which 1956 unearthed could be made accessible to people who could not communicate in Sinhala. For someone like Regi, with his own inability to wield Sinhala, to delve so deeply into the social and even political dynamics of a work of art, was a marvel in itself. Who else could have inferred in Maname and Rekava the foundations of a new cultural sphere 
And yet, as I mentioned before, he was not a believer in monoliths. His outlook was informed not by a Sinhala or Buddhist ethos, nor by an amorphous, vaguely defined cosmopolitanism, but by a secular Marxist, humanist ethos that was not uprooted from the wellsprings of his countrys culture. That this culture happened to be populated by Sinhala Buddhists did not deter him from making controversial remarks. Some of those remarks, one can pass over. Others, one cannot. Among those one can brush aside were reviews preoccupied with taking chauvinism to task. These were reviews in which he brought the cultural and the political together, and although he did bring them together perceptively, there were, admittedly, times when he could not. So it was when he indicted Nanda Malini for including in Chandra Madulu Yata a verse alluding to the Sihala le running through the veins of the narrator. Such remarks were surprisingly not that rare. While they revealed his growing political awareness (having rejected both Trotskyism and Leninism, he became a believer in humanist ideals), they also seemed to reveal an animus of sorts against a particular culture. It would have been for this reason that Susantha Goonathilake criticised him, though in passing, in his seminal book on NGOs and foreign funded agencies, Recolonisation.
The length and breadth of the mans scholarship was so wide that it is hard to believe he got a Second Lower at University, a point he makes obvious when he ascribes a Second Lower to the narrator of his novel Among My Souvenirs, which was based on his experiences growing up. As my friend Dhanuka Bandara, himself a worthy critic (who unfortunately does not write anymore), told me years ago, however, this was not really a surprise, since many of those in the English Department who think on their own, independently, tend to rebel against the tenets on which exams are usually assessed. And yet, when you read his reviews, even his political pieces, and when you try to grasp his wealth of detail as he pores over cultural and political specifics, you can only class him alongside the intellectuals he admired, walked with, and esteemed, like the eminent historians, Fernand Braudel and Isaac Deutscher. I am not sure whether he was the only student from his class who went on to achieve such great heights in the literary sphere, but if he was, I would not be surprised. He made up for his academic credentials, in other words, by being the polymath that he was. 
And we are all the better for that.

Rise of the dollar and fight against the fall of a Nation
	
	Inflation is the rate at which the general level of prices for goods and services are rising
	
	
	With developing mindsets of the common people, it is very important to build a stable economy for sustainability of any government in future to remain in power.
	
	It is very important that the entrepreneurs, local industrialists and the people focus on long term goals

The dollar has reached its highest in the history of Sri Lanka against the rupee. It is alarming and assume to reach even higher within the next couple of months. Inflation is the rate at which the general level of prices for goods and services are rising and, consequently, the purchasing power of currency is falling.
As a result of this, the tax hikes are also common.
Usually the temporary political remedy and peoples desires are to have a rapid wage increase to match the gap of the additional cost of living which everyone is happy to accept.

This cycle has been the case since the independence and ever continuing but preventing Lankas economic growth.
What we have forgotten and what we have ignored is the fact to seize the situation and to give a long-standing solution to build our national economy.
As an island nation we must identify and capitalize on our strengths to design a successful economic model similar to successful nations but yet a unique one to match for ourselves. For this, we have to come out from the islanders mentality and think out of the box.
Service oriented industries, tourism and offshore services could be given priority in parallel. We must mould the mindset of the young generation to have the correct attitudes to work hard to build the nation. This needs to have an education system which would prioritize social values, knowledge and commitment.

As an island nation we must identify and capitalize on our strengths to design a successful economic model similar to successful nations but yet a unique one to match for ourselves.

A country with minimum resources in terms of raw material and specialized skills for innovative production industry needs its practical approach in facilitating the local entrepreneurs. The local industries of manufacturing products needs to improve, promote and develop to cater to the local consumption first and then to reach the export markets. It is also important to utilize the opportunities of the trade agreements between countries facilitating advantages to exports.
Though we spend foreign exchange for importing raw materials, the value addition itself directly contributes a lot to the society and the countrys economy in terms of providing job opportunities as well as the supporting sub industries and services within the country.
This will instantly create an environment with job opportunities within the society.
This is the only way out for the nation to stand strong against any economic crisis and to earn foreign exchange through exports.
To implement and encourage the entrepreneurs to align with a focus, the policy makers have a tremendous role to play and a new trend of bureaucracy with a national mindset has to be inculcated in the society immediately.
The government is the key player in the implementation of this programme and the regulators must have a practical approach and support facilitating the local entrepreneurs to do business.
Corruption has to be curtailed to its minimum and government sector officials need to be shifted in between the departments periodically to prevent any corruption bases they may create, being in one place over a long period of time. This practice is maintained by many of the developed countries where they have independent surveillance mechanisms to monitor such departments where possible corruption could be identified.
With developing mindsets of the common people, it is very important to build a stable economy for sustainability of any government in future to remain in power.
Government also needs to support and encourage entrepreneurs to look for innovative industries to produce sophisticated high-end products like medicine which the government depended as a subsidized area of mandatory spending with high foreign exchange outflows.

To implement and encourage the entrepreneurs to align with a focus, the policy makers have a tremendous role to play and a new trend of bureaucracy with a national mindset has to be inculcated in the society immediately.

However with limited raw material and expertise resources for such industries, we still have advantages even for value addition, so we create job opportunities and supporting services which brings cash flow to the economy.
It is very important that the entrepreneurs, local industrialists and the people focus on long term goals in terms of production, agriculture, service oriented industries while the government has to support and facilitate with special schemes encouraging people to invest on revenue generated industries.
It will somewhat help to stabilize the imbalanced local economy and obviously settle the international ratings so that the foreign investors will invest in the country without any hesitation.
Recently, such a scheme was initiated by the Ministry of Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine through its line corporation, SPMC introducing a joint venture scheme encouraging investors to invest on pharmaceutical manufacturing in Sri Lanka.
It is a brilliant initiative by Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne which is the first ever Public Private Partnership in the history of Sri Lanka, with no burden to the government.
It is based on a buy-back guarantee and 21 companies are being given cabinet approvals to invest on pharma manufacturing plants. The produce of these factories are to be supplied to the Medical Supplies Division through the SPMC mandate.
The said 21 companies have gone through a vigorous screening process by a TEC to identify the production capabilities and their financial backgrounds.
Some have already started production while the rest of the companies have already started preliminary work.
The National Chamber of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers of Sri Lanka (NCPM) with this initiative has already addressed a few concerns related to the industry in common and have got instant solutions for the duty/tax waivers for the raw-materials which the whole industry is benefited and long waited for by the existing manufacturers.
NCPM addressing many issues related to the pharma manufacturing industry, will start a dialogue with the pharma importers and the other non-member manufacturers who are much thankful to NCPM for instantly achieving many benefits for them and for the industry.
NCPM is in the process of designing tailor-made packages for its members and discussing with the executive committee to facilitate another category of membership for other manufacturers who request to be benefitted and be part of the transparent result-oriented approach of the NCPM.
In par with the national interest, NCPM will promote and support the local pharma industrialists at least to reach the desired goal to be self-sufficient in local pharma needs by 2025.
This initiative is surely a success story and a pillar of strength to raise the national economy.
Supporting further, the ministry of finance has initiated a special funding scheme under the guidance of the Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera, to promote local industries and the NCPM will guide and facilitate its membership to be benefited by the scheme offering low interest funding for their projects.
Being affiliated to IDMA (Indian Drug Manufacturers Association), the European Pharma Chamber and Czech Chamber of Pharma Manufacturers, NCPM will definitely take the Sri Lankan pharma industry to the next international level of markets through its reach of affiliations.
Focusing on key values and the Nationalistic vision, its our mission to minimize the foreign exchange outflow and to bring in foreign exchange by pharmaceutical exports which will be a winning approach of a rising nation.
The writer is the President of National Chamber of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers of Sri Lanka ( NCPM)

Second year commemoration : Failed coup attempt in the Turkish Republic
	
Article written by Tunca zuhadar, Ambassador to Republic of Turkey on the occasion of the second year commemoration of the thwarted coup attempt on July 15, 2016

A commemoration event was held on July 13 to mark the second year of the thwarted coup attempt of July 15 2016. The event was held at the Residence of Turkish Ambassador in Colombo with the participation of government Ministers, Ambassadors and High Commissioners, and distinguished personalities.
Fetullah Glen, the leader of FETO, was the mastermind behind what happened in Turkey on 15th July, 2016. Fetullah Glen and his disciples planned and tried to capture the Turkish Republic. They did not hesitate to use lethal military force against innocent civilians, killing 251 and wounding thousands.
The two-year long investigations and judicial process on the events of 16th July have produced countless crucial evidences. Most recent findings illustrate that even on the night of 15th July, the plotters were in direct communication with the FETO leadership. However, to judge the deeds of this man and his organisation only with what transpired on 15th July would be a mistake. The crimes committed on the night of July 15th can be considered as only the tip of the iceberg.
To understand why Fetullah Glen and FETO have become the number one enemy in Turkey, we will need to look at their actions and the resulting trauma that the Turkish nation experienced. It all started under the guise of a charitable education effort. I would like to emphasize this aspect because that is exactly what this organisation is up to in many countries. Unfortunately, we could not decipher their darker underbelly earlier. They disguised themselves as a benign education movement and started the campaign of establishing schools in Turkey and later, around the world. 
But, we now understand that this was the first step of an infiltration campaign where kids and their parents were recruited with the seemingly innocent promise of a better education and a good job. These kids were put through schools with academic and financial help and were subjected to a heavy hand of indoctrination. They turned into unquestioning foot soldiers of Fetullah Glen. They were provided with the answers to entrance exams for prominent schools and later, for prestigious government jobs. They were ordered to stay hidden and to infiltrate State institutions. They were told, to achieve their main goal of capturing the State, they could eschew all ethical, religious or personal beliefs. Their handlers kept their indoctrination up-to-date and passed on the instructions of their leader. As civil servants or military personnel, their loyalty was not to the nation, or to the State they served. They did not care about upholding the Constitution or the legal system of the country.

July 15thwas a desperate move to keep their control in place and to capture the state which they were aiming to do through infiltration

The crime syndicate behind all this devised and ran an integrated system that took care of recruitment through schools and private tuition classes; financing was taken care of by holding companies and donations from business people. The organisation established media houses to shape the public opinion for and against many persons, groups or ideas. Many persons in Turkey who saw the organisation for what it really was were lynched by these media houses. These media houses became the focal point for actions taken against journalists, academics, bureaucrats and military officers who opposed them, or tried to expose them. They were lynched and purged.


As the organisation grew stronger and became more affluent, it started meddling in business transactions and government tender processes. Money laundering, illegal cash transfers and other financial crimes became their usual business.
When the Turkish government finally understood what was actually taking place, FETO started to take drastic and extreme actions. The first wave of these actions came in December 2013, where the organisation released a number of so-called recordings and fabricated material. That attack proved inconclusive and provided the wake-up call both to the government and to the public.
Upon discovering their secret communication systems and intercepting the instructions, we started to counter their moves and discover the extent of the infiltration and the infection it had caused. July 15th happened at a time when the Turkish armed forces had discovered and was getting ready to expel most of the so-called military personnel who were actually recruits of the organisation.
July 15th was a desperate move to keep their control in place and to capture the state which they were aiming to do through infiltration. Despite the fact that we define it as a coup attempt, this was no ordinary coup. In none of the coup or coup attempts in the past did we have the putschists opening fire on civilians, let alone bombing the parliament, the presidential complex or the Police Headquarters.
FETO established itself in around 160 countries including Sri Lanka, with thousands of schools and businesses. Their actions in Turkey should be considered as a wake-up-call for other countries. We are pleased to note ever increasing awareness on part of our partners regarding the security threat posed by FETO. In many regions, FETO schools and other entities have been closely inspected and put under State control. Investigations into FETO structures and FETO operatives are under way in many countries. Global crime apparatus of this organisation is shrinking.

One of the SIM cards recovered from the remand prison cell of Arjun Aloysius and Kasun Palisena had been used by an underworld figure, who was allegedly involved with a recent killing in the South, Senior Deputy Solicitor General (SDSG) Haripriya Jayasundera said during the magisterial inquiry over the Bond Scam today.
While informing the court about the probability of further legal action being taken into the incident by the prosecution, SDSG Jayasundera said that the prosecution was still receiving the communication details of the five SIM cards from service providers to deal with the matter more intensively.
"The CID's investigations into the details of the SIM cards could lead to very important revelations as one of the SIM cards was used by an underworld figure who is believed to have been involved in a murder in the southern part of the country," a source said.
Meanwhile, Perpetual Treasuries Ltd owner Arjun Aloysius and its CEO Kasun Palisena were ordered to be re-remanded till August 2 by the Magistrate over the Magisterial Inquiry in which they were accused of abetting and conspiring with Arjuna Mahendran to misappropriate public funds worth Rs. 688 million during the Bond Auction held on February 27, 2015.

SL charges man deported from family by Australia
	
A Sri Lankan deported by Australia even though his partner had refugee status there was charged upon his return with illegally leaving his home country.
Thileepan Gnaneswaran, who was separated from his wife and 11-month-old daughter, arrived in Colombo Tuesday along with another 17 who had also their asylum applications rejected by Australia.
"They were taken before a magistrate and released on personal bail," a senior police official told AFP. "They were charged under the immigration law for leaving the country from a place other than an approved port."
Sri Lankans are known to travel illegally by boat to Australia and other countries, in violation of immigration laws.
The offence carries a fine of 200,000 rupees ($1,250) and a maximum prison term of five years.
In practice, people are seldom jailed.
The UN refugee agency earlier voiced alarm at Australia's decision to "actively and indefinitely separate" 30-year-old Gnaneswaran from his family.
His deportation "contravenes the basic right of family unity, as well as the fundamental principle of the best interests of the child", the UNHCR said in a Tuesday statement.
The UN has long criticised Australia's policy of "offshore processing and deterrence". Since 2013 asylum-seekers who have reached the country by boat are shipped off to remote camps in Nauru and Papua New Guinea for processing.
They are barred from resettling in Australia even if subsequently granted refugee status.
The policy has led to numerous separations of refugee families since those who arrive in Australia by sea have been prevented from reuniting with their loved ones in the country, the UNHCR said Tuesday.
Sri Lankans have attempted to illegally enter Australia by boat and in recent years almost all have been stopped and returned back.
In May, a group of 131 Sri Lankans were stopped by Malaysian authorities as they tried to head towards New Zealand by boat.
Official figures show that Australia has stopped 32 people-smuggling boats since 2013 and sent back some 800 people to their country of origin.
Australian media reports said that Gnaneswaran, a member of Sri Lanka's minority Tamil community, was tortured by security forces because of his family's alleged connections to the now-defunct Tamil Tiger rebels.
Police said Gnaneswaran was told to appear in court on September 28 for a preliminary hearing. (Economy Next)

The Foundation for Civilian Bravery: Recognizing  silent heroes
	
Kasun Chandraratne
Pic by Damith Wickramasinghe

It takes a lot of courage to risk your own life and save anothers life. It becomes an honourable act when you dont expect anything in return. There have been stories of kings and other locals whom we have referred to as heroes but the actual heroes are behind the scenes. Identifying the need to recognise such individuals, Kasun Chandraratne had a vision to bring them to the limelight. Hence, the Foundation for Civilian Bravery was born 24 years ago.
I was quite fond of the language in the Readers Digest and used to buy it regularly, recalled Chandraratne in an interview with Mirror of Hope. In one of them I read about a girl in India who had saved her fathers life and was recognized for Civilian Bravery by the Carnegie Hero Fund Commission. Then this idea dawned in me and I thought I should start something similar in Sri Lanka.
I never had an idea to start a foundation but I drafted a law titled Presidents Trust for Civilian Bravery during Premadasas tenure. But then I was constantly asked whether there were such people and if so, how to find them. Although I didnt know how, I was adamant to move ahead with this concept and the Foundation for Civilian Bravery was born 24 years ago. So far we have succeeded in acknowledging the attempts made by people to save another persons life.

Women are the most suitable people for bravery but their stories are unheard of. This year we received close to 200 applications but I am sure there are more incidents of people who have committed their time and risked their lives for the sake of another human being...

Back in the day national heroes were kings or affluent people in society. This could be because we are a traditional society, he added. The value is attached to the position and title a person holds. The maiden activity was when a 74-year old ferryman in Ukwatte, Kalutara risked his life to save six passengers when his ferry capsized and he passed away while saving the sixth.
I have come across stories of coconut pluckers saving another pluckers life when the latters shoulder dislocated while he was at the top of the tree, a cleaner in Kandy rescuing two children from a house on fire and so on. Therefore, we do have stories and Im sure there are many people who have risked their lives to save anothers life and have never been acknowledged. We eventually grew and if we look at other countries such as Australia and America, civilian bravery has been around for over 100 years. But Sri Lanka has a history of over 2500 years and we have heard lesser stories of civilian bravery.

This year a students category was introduced to give an opportunity to them as well. They cant risk their lives but it is important to give them the direction of bravery,

Speaking further Chandraratne said that the term civilian bravery has no definition. But we introduced three criteria that an applicant or nominee should fulfil. If I sum it up in a sentence, the award is given to a person who voluntarily saves another person who is in peril. The design of the medal depicts a person saving a being, which could be either a person or an animal with floods and fire in the background and the octagonal shape indicates the eight directions.
This years winner is a CTB bus driver in Haputale who was driving down a slope in a bus with faulty breaks. There had been 22 people in the bus and when he realized the fault he had asked the passengers to shift to the other side. He had driven against the hill and while saving the lives of the 22 people, three others were killed in the accident including him. Therefore such people should be recognized for their bravery. The National Civilian Bravery Awards Night is an annual event where we have been recognising these people since its inception.
This year a students category was introduced to give an opportunity to them as well. They cant risk their lives but it is important to give them the direction of bravery, Chandraratne continued. Therefore a student who is a member of a social service organization who dedicates his or her time for the cause is eligible to apply under this category. Here we introduce the concept of biophyllic which translates to jaivahithakami in Sinhala and bravery is something that is linked with biology. Therefore we are encouraging students to do social service and show them that they can commit bravery since they love living beings.
Chandraratne encourages more applicants to apply and let their voices be heard.
Im very keen to encourage people in the North and East to apply. There have been few cases but Im sure there are many more.
Also if we really look at it, women are the most suitable people for bravery but their stories are unheard of. This year we received close to 200 applications but I am sure there are more incidents of people who have committed their time and risked their lives for the sake of another human being or an animal, that we just dont know about.
Referring to the book titled The Social Conquest of Earth by Edward O. Wilson, Chandraratne related how humans have worked in groups for survival from the hunter-gatherer days. In other words, altruism is something that we all have.
In research conducted by Wilson he says that ants and bees have societies with agriculture and other elements. They are similar to humans in a lot of ways. Therefore theres altruism in all of us, at least as a suppressed trait. Another observation we can take from the animal kingdom is that of the monkey that spots a tiger. He climbs up the tree and alarms other animals. As such it fits all the criteria we have emphasized; the monkey risks its own life voluntarily to save the rest of the animals. This is also seen in birds when a snake approaches a nest. Therefore its in the genes of animals, but as a society its limited since we have more selfish traits. We need to be humble and appreciate people in all levels of society. Until that happens, society will never change.
This wonderful organisation isnt Government funded and Kasun has poured his heart and soul into it to make sure that if you save and serve, you will be recognised.

If you know of a brave soul who has risked his or her life to save anothers or if you want to contribute to this cause contact the Foundation on +94 38 224 1777 or drop an email to info@civilianbravery.org

Tribes and tribalism, pots and kettles...
	

Weerasekeras criticism of Deepika Udagama was clearly out of order
	
	Both groups go easy on the Rajapaksas and appear to favour a Gotabhaya Presidency

Minister of Finance and Mass Media Mangala Samaraweera has stated that he is against the death penalty. In his opinion, the death penalty, even if implemented, will not stop drug barons. He has said, however, that despite his personal opinion on the matter he stands by the collective decision of the cabinet to implement the death penalty. Noble of him, and honourable too when it comes to the notion of collective responsibility.
Minister Samaraweera pointed out that it is wrong to paint all drug offenders with the same brush. He is correct. An addict is different to a peddler, to a trafficker and a drug lord. He proposes more rehabilitation for addicts. Reasonable. He says, the best solution is to implement the law, and one assumes he is referring to enforcers doing their job without being subdued by corrupt and compromised superiors or powerful politicians. We cant agree more.
However, Samaraweera forgets that a call for the implementation of the law is also a call for implementing the death penalty which, he should know, is part of the law. Someone will inform him one day and then perhaps we can expect the honorable and conscientious minister to present a private members bill to axe capital punishment.
The Minister has said that the police operates as judge, jury and murderer, and argues that therefore it is hard to believe that the death penalty would help rid the country of the drug menace. We do not know if he has prevailed on party and relevant friends to question the Police Commission on whats being done about this sorry state of affairs hehas described. 
Thats not all. Samaraweera believes that those who are said to run the drug business from prisons, as alleged, are only second tier operatives. The bigwigs, he said, are members of Lions Clubs, Rotary Clubs and Buddhist organizations. When he made this sweeping disclosure he left out politicians. However, a few days later, Samaraweera rendered an unreserved apology to those involved in Lions and Rotary clubs. It was inadvertent, he confessed. He did not, however, say a word about the Buddhist organizations. No regret, no apology. Intentional, then, we have to conclude. 
What are Buddhist Organizations Well, it would include the entire Buddhist order and by association castigates the Maha Nayaka Theras of the three Nikayas. Included also is the All Ceylon Buddhist Congress (the Bauddha Sammelanayaas he put it), the YMBA, the pirivenas,daham pasal and even the Buddhist Societies in schools all over the island. 
Lets assume that some other blundering minister had let slip something like this: the drug lords can be found in Christian organizations (including Catholic and non-Catholic entities such as the Anglicans, Methodists and even the plethora of evangelical outfits registered under the Companies Act). We would have civil society outfits screaming in horror about religious intolerance, theocratic intent of religious majoritarianism and other choice labels. 
This is Mangala, however, and hes kosher in the book of honourable men and women in such organizations or in Western diplomatic missions or UN agencies. This is Mangala and moreover its a broadside at Buddhists and that too is legitimate in their book.
I call it tribalism, and this brings me to a rant by an organization that fits the above description, the Friday Forum (FF). 
A Sunday newspaper picked from the bottom of the text of a FF missive the following headline: Eliyato andura and on to a vipath maga. Thats nothing more than a cheap crack at two organizations, Eliya and Viyath Maga. The former concerns itself with constitutional reform and the latter with mobilizing the intellectual resources that a future government would require. 

Minister Samaraweera pointed out that it is wrong to paint all drug offenders with the same brush. He is correct. An addict is different to a peddler, to a trafficker and a drug lord. He proposes more rehabilitation for addicts

Prominent individuals in these forums are not exactly fellow-travellers with those belonging to the FF and fraternal outfits. Nevertheless, they cant be rubbished on account of that alone. Both groups go easy on the Rajapaksas and appear to favour a Gotabhaya Presidency. On the other hand, the Friday Forum as well as related civil (sic) society groups are virulently anti-Rajapaksa and are tokenish when it comes to wrongdoing and related complicity on the part of Yahapalanists. Their memories begin in 2005 for they are even loathe to revisit Chandrika Kumaratungas tenure leave alone the bloody UNP regimes of the 1980s; indeed theyve even forgotten their own outrage during Kumaratungas time [FF came later but their members were alive back then and quite professional too]. 
Anyway, the cheap shot alluded to above, betrays the poverty of civility and compromises the intellectual posturing of the FF. Lets move to the substance of that piece. 

The Minister has said that the police operates as Judge, jury and murderer, and argues that therefore it is hard to believe that the death penalty would help rid the country of the drug menace

FF strains to revive a now old and tired tirade regarding a reference to Hitler made by a bikkhu at a ceremony attended by Gotabhaya Rajapaksa. The bikkhu, Ven. Vendaruwe Upali, the Anunayaka Thera of the Asgiriya Chapter, calls for a dharmika leader or a righteous leader. Those who castigated the bikkhu either dont know Sinhala or are mischievous for that word was translated as religious and taken to mean Buddhist. FF merely piggybacks on the rant. Sure, theyve thrown in Vijayakala Maheswarans slip regarding the LTTE, but thats essentially tokenism. 
FF has also referred to comments made by Rear Admiral (Rtd) Sarath Weerasekara on Dr. Deepika Udagama, Chairperson of the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka (HRCSL). Weerasekeras criticism of Deepika Udagama was clearly out of order. It is simplistic and wrong to call anyone supportive of a new Constitution a traitor (as Weerasekera has done). It is worse to call for trial and execution, although many in the tribe that the FF belongs to use the same narrative when it comes to war crimes [allege crime and punish the named and shamed].
However, anyone who advocates devolution without delving into grievance and without taking into account geographical, demographic, historical and economic realities is as more more simplistic, and indeed, given the armed land-theft drive of Tamil nationalists, it is a recipe for a divided state. Thats what spokespersons for FF have regularly done. 
FF for example sees devolution of power as a necessity. Others dont have to agree, but calling those who are opposed extremists or accusing them of engaging in adversarial and divisive politics is downright silly. Their opponents could very well use the same descriptives on FF. 
FF once said Cynical exploitation of sectarian fears and insecurities obstruct our common search for truth, justice and reconciliation. Well, thats exactly what FF does, one can argue, except that the sectarian fears and insecurities they exploit are those of non-Sinhala and non-Buddhist communities. 
Udagama stated, I observe the alarming silence of decent people; the brashness of tribal voices that once again wish to unleash ethnic violence.
Whats decent and who is decent The FF and its ilk Well, I see brashness and tribalism in FF statements as well as statements issued by political fellow travelers. No one acknowledges a wish to unleash ethnic violence. Thats Udagamas fantasy. However, there are many ways in which ethnic violence can erupt and one can argue that pandering to Eelamists is one such way. The FF and Udagama can be called out for just that too.
She is upset about the silence of the decent. And among the indecent according to her are professional bodies that play politics and abandon ethical obligations and opinion makers who think of winning an argument for the moment, and abandon responsibility for the future. 
The FF is made of many professionals. Doesnt the FF play politics Does it adhere to ethical obligations Are they not about scoring debating points The truth is they are no different from those they criticize. They are as tribalistic. They are as clubbish. They are as selective. They are as irresponsible. 
Theres an easy way to find out. Flip the script. Ask how would you respond if the Rajapaksas did this or that (that the yahapalanists do) or simply check the issues that the FF concerned itself with during the previous regime. Immediately the grouse about being partisan sounds silly. 
Where, for example, is the righteous rant from the FF about the utterly counter-democratic nature of the yahapalanists regarding elections And will the FF take Mangala Samaraweera to the cleaners for his crass statement about Buddhist organizations Lets see.

Two elephants of Sinharaja to be kept in separate area: SF
	
The two last remaining elephants of the Sinharaja Forest reserve would be kept in a separate region under supervision, Minister of Wildlife Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka said.
Area is about 80 acres within the forest reserve. We hope this would mitigate issues with regard to human-elephant conflict, he said.
He said these two elephants had killed at least 15 people and 200 cattle and destroyed 300 coconut trees.
Years ago, there were seventeen elephants in the Sinharaja Forest Reserve, but now only two are left. Most of them died because of humans, Minster Fonseka told a news conference on Wednesday.
He said that there was nothing wrong in the decision legally, and added that the Director General of Wildlife had the authority on Wildlife Conservation to take decisions in this regard.
We are doing it not only for the sake of people but for the sake of the elephants as well. Otherwise it is a risk for their lives. Even at the moment, we are treating four elephants that were injured by the trap guns, he said.
When people got angry, they will use trap guns and hakkapatas, which are a threat to the lives of elephants. People are facing many issues due to this situation, he said.
He said they would try to keep these two elephants under control in the specified area.
Earlier, President Maithripala Sirisena instructed officials to suspend the transfer of these two elephants from the Sinharaja Forest Reserve until a proper remedy was found. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)

## Title: UK MP Paisley urged to quit over holidays funded by SL govt.

UK MP Paisley urged to quit over holidays funded by SL govt.
	
A Democratic Unionist MP is facing calls to quit after a watchdog recommended his suspension from the House of Commons for failing to register two family holidays funded by the Sri Lankan government.
Ian Paisley had already apologised for what he said was his unintentional failure to register the hospitality, which he estimated was worth 50,000.
Politicians from across the political divide in Northern Ireland have called on the high-profile MP to stand down.
The 30-day suspension recommended by a parliamentary watchdog on Wednesday could force Mr Paisley to face a by-election.
Members who are suspended from the Commons for more than 10 days are open to a recall petition.
A by-election would be triggered if 10% of the electorate in Mr Paisleys North Antrim constituency sign that petition.
If rubber stamped by Parliament, the suspension will also mean Prime Minister Theresa May will be shorn of one of the 10 DUP MPs propping up her minority government during a period that could see a number of crucial Brexit votes in the House of Commons.
Sinn Fein president Mary Lou McDonald said Mr Paisley should do the honourable thing and quit.
I think the charges made against him and findings against him are very serious, she said.
I would imagine his constituents in North Antrim, and certainly public opinion across Ireland, would expect that having been sanctioned in the way hes been sanctioned then he should do the honourable thing and step down.
The SDLP said Mr Paisleys position was untenable.
Party Assembly member Colin McGrath said a 30-day suspension was not enough.
The SDLP will be seeking a recall petition to dismiss Paisley from Westminster, and should this trigger a by-election in North Antrim, Mr Paisley should not challenge the seat again, he said.
Alliance Assembly member Paula Bradshaw also urged Mr Paisley to consider his position.
Mr Paisley has let both himself and his constituents down, calling into question his personal integrity and the ability of voters to trust him, she said.
Leader of the Traditional Unionist Voice party Jim Allister called on Mr Paisley to refund the Sri Lankan government the money it spent on hosting him, accusing the MP of serious and shameful breaches of Parliaments code of conduct.
The sanction was outlined by the House of Commons Standards Committee following receipt of the findings of an investigation by the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards.
The committee said Mr Paisley, son of late DUP founder the Rev Ian Paisley, had committed serious misconduct and his actions were of a nature to bring the House of Commons into disrepute.
The report, which said the cost of the hospitality may have been significantly more than Mr Paisleys 50,000 estimate, said the Sri Lankan holidays in 2013 included business-class air travel, accommodation at first-class hotels, helicopter trips and visits to tourist attractions for the North Antrim MP and his wider family.
The trips also included meeting with Sri Lankan governmental figures.
The threshold for registering such hospitality in 2013 was around 660.
In March 2014, Mr Paisley wrote to the then prime minister David Cameron to lobby against a proposed United Nations resolution setting up an international investigation into alleged human rights abuses in Sri Lanka.
The committee noted that in his letter, the MP did not declare the financial benefits he and his family had received from the Sri Lankan government during the previous 12 months.
Amnesty International Northern Ireland director Patrick Corrigan said: The real outrage at the heart of this scandal is an MP attempting to have the United Kingdom government oppose a United Nations investigation into the horrific war crimes committed in Sri Lanka.
The watchdog also recommended that Mr Paisley should now register the holidays with the parliamentary authorities.
The recommendations will need to be approved by the House of Commons before being confirmed.
Mr Paisley is due to address the House on Thursday.
The story was first reported by The Daily Telegraph in September 2017, in a report which estimated the cost of the hospitality at 100,000.
A statement issued by Mr Paisleys lawyer on Thursday said: My client has apologised unreservedly at the outset for his unintentional failure to register the hospitality he received.
While accepting the decision of the House Standards Committee, he nonetheless continues to take issue with the sensationalised report in the Daily Telegraph.
Legal proceedings are being considered.
No further comment will be made until Mr Paisley has addressed the House on Thursday.
A DUP spokesman said: The party has noted the House of Commons Standards Committees report on Ian Paisley MP. These matters will now be considered by the party officers.(Belfast Telegraph)

Ukraine detains illegal migrants from SL, India
	
Thirteen illegal immigrants from Sri Lanka, India and Bangladesh had been detained by the Ukrainian border guards of the Lviv and Lutsk detachments, the Ukrinform News agency reported on Thursday.
The Ukrainian State Border Guard Service has said guards have spotted six foreigners who did not have any documents with them and watched two people cross the Western Bug River along the border line.
Border guards immediately informed their Polish counterparts. As a result of joint and coordinated actions by the Ukrainian side, Polish border guards detained two more people. They were citizens of Russia and Azerbaijan, a statement issued by the Border Guard Service said.
It said that all details of preparations for the violation of the state border were established during verification measures.
In particular, it was established that a Russian and a Azerbaijani intended to send five Sri Lankans and an Indian to the European Union in search of a "better life."
At present, Polish foreign colleagues are expected to send the foreigners to Ukraine. The foreigners detained by Ukrainian border guards, after their identification, are to be held accountable for the attempt to break the border.

"Army to be restructured, not downsizing"
	
The Government informed Parliament yesterday that the Army would be restructured as per the time demands but it would not result in a downsizing.
This assurance was given by both Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and State Minister of Defence Ruwan Wijewardene, who responded to a question raised by Joint Opposition Parliamentary Group Leader Dinesh Gunawardane in the House last afternoon.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said the Army Commander Mahesh Senanayake, had informed him that he was willing to have a dialogue with the Opposition and explain the real position to them.
The decision to restructure was made by the Army itself and not by me or by the President. Decisions regarding the Security Forces are made by the military officers. The Government has nothing to do with it, The Prime Minister said.
Mr Wickremesinghe said even the British Army went through restructuring after the completion of World War II.
He said the Sri Lankan security forces were well recognized today as they had been called to be a part of UN Peace Keeping Operations in Mali.
He said Sri Lankan security forces would be playing a major role in ensuring the security of Indian Ocean region before long.
Mr Wijewardene said few brigades would be merged but would not be abolished.
One may perceive that the Army will be downsized and weakened but it is not the reality as the number soldiers and officers serving the army will not be reduced at all with this exercise, he said.
The State Minister of Defence also dismissed the claim made by the Opposition that more than 100 Army camps in the North would be dismantled.
He said no camp had been closed in the North, while there was no plan to close down in the future as well.
Also, he said some brigades in the Army did not have the number of personnel as stipulated. He said downsizing would not happen in such circumstances.
Mr Gunawardane who raised the question on the issue charged that the Army was going to be downsized by 23,000, while 100 camps were to be closed down with the proposed restructuring. (Yohan Perera and Ajith Siriwardana)

Be aware of Phishing attack: CERT|CC
	
The Computer Emergency Readiness Team-Coordination Centre (CERT|CC) requested social media or email users to be aware of Phishing attack circulating over the internet.
The Phishing attacks typically rely on social networking techniques applied to email or other electronic communication methods, including direct messages sent over social networks, SMS text messages and other instant messaging modes.
Speaking to the Daily Mirror CERT|CC Principal Information Security Engineer Roshan Chandragupta said a number of complaints had been received about a number of social media accounts being hacked into.
Phishing is a cyber attack that uses a disguised email as a weapon. The goal is to trick the mail recipient or social media user to click a link which enables the hackers to breach into their accounts.
If a user clicks on the received email link, that will open a similar login page to the Facebook (FB) and asks for the FB username and the password. When typing the username and the password it will provide access to the victims FB profile, he said.
Most of the complaints were made regarding the changing of FB accounts. If a user mistakenly clicked on the received FB request which arrived as an email, opens a similar login page to the Facebook which is, in fact, a fake Facebook Login, Mr Chandragupta said.
If the user logged in to their own Facebook profile, they should be alert of two activities. There should have to be a green padlock mark display near the address bar to show that the profile login was a secured connection and with the hyperlink address of https://www.facebook.com. Or there Two-factor authentication should have to be activated, he said
If someone was a victim of the Phishing Attack, they can be activated the two-factor authentication can be activated from the -Security and Login- page on the Facebook settings.
That can verify the true Facebook profile user while receiving a verification code with the use of own mobile number.
Mr Chandragupta requested social media users to be cautious about clicking email likes. They should always check their profile address bar starts with https://www.facebook.com. There is no need to re-enter social media login or profile password once you logged in, he said.
Email accounts are also hacked using the same method. (Chaturanga Samarawickrama)

## Title: BIA to get a domestic flight terminal

BIA to get a domestic flight terminal
	
The Government is to build a separate new terminal at the Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA) for the use of domestic flights in order to promote domestic air travel for the benefit of tourists, with the development of all domestic airports and using bigger aircraft.
The Cabinet Approval was granted for a proposal made for this purpose jointly by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe as the Minister of National Policies and Economic Affairs and State Minister of Transport and Civil Aviation Asoka Abeysinghe last week.
Accordingly, the National Agency for Public-Private Partnership (NAPPP), with the assistance of the Director General Civil Aviation (DGCA) has called for Expression of Interests (EOIs) to set up scheduled domestic air services and five investment proposals have been received
They are- Saffron Aviation, FITS Aviation, SJ Global Investments, Lotus Air and IWS Aviation.
These companies are ready to use bigger aircraft with more seating capacity up to 118 seats for domestic flights from their own investment.
These Expressions of Interest (EOI) s have been evaluated by a committee composing Director General of Civil Aviation, the NAPPP Chairman and Executive Director Airport and Aviation Services.
Based on the evaluation of the proposals made by prospective investors and several post-bid discussions, a few recommendations have been made by the committee:
Each of those who responded to the EOI may submit applications to the DG-CA for required licenses, permits and facilities for operations and such permits shall be provided on a first come first served basis.
The domestic terminal to be created at BIA for common use on identified AASL land. Also, there is no hangar space at BIA for each operator separately, but one hangar to be constructed for maintenance work of all domestic operators.
A portion of Apron D at the BIA to be designated as Domestic Apron for use of domestic flight enabling application of different charging mechanisms and avoiding possible complaints by foreign airlines for discriminatory practices at the international airport.
Hangar space to be provided at Ratmalana for night parking of aircraft as this cannot be done at BIA.
Batticaloa, Sigiriya, Palali, Hingurakgoda, Koggala and Trincomalee to be made available in Phase 1 for scheduled carriers on a needs basis.
Domestic aviation needs to be carried out under the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) rules in conformity with international standards. As such, CAA and SLAF would jointly work out modalities for Trincomalee, Sigiriya, Palali, Hingurakgoda and Koggala airports to ensure that all civilian operations at these airports are carried out under CAA rules.
Self-handling by private operators will be permitted other than at BIA. Ground handling charges and cargo rates OF BIA to be revised downward for domestic carriers in consultation with Sri Lankan Airlines.
Suitable arrangements to be made for fuel supply at each airport through SLAF or CPC. Allocation of slots will be subject to providing priority to international, SLAF and VIP air traffic as determined by DGCA
Due to constraints faced by private operators, the DGCA in consultation with the Ministry of Defense and UDA to identify few locations in Colombo City for passenger pick-up and drop-off. (Sandun A Jayasekera)

Damsel in distressLanka in agony
	
The real man smiles in trouble, gathers strength from distress, and grows brave by reflection.~Thomas Paine

Ethnic violence and ethnic discrimination has taken deep root in the psyche of the adolescent who has now reached his middle age
	
	S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike, who for his inflated egoistic reasons and mad rush to power, floated the idea of Sinhala-only policy

Her clothes were ripped off; body battered; mind confused and heart burnt; she was raped and dishonoured and violated beyond recognition. All the traditions and values that were associated with a young woman in a rural hamlet were stolen from her, so to speak. For one offender to another successive criminal, her body and soul became a playground; she was defamed, defaced and debased. Yet, while all these undignified and unscrupulous deeds were committed by her own children who claim that this was all done in order to protect her and her good name, those who did not participate in these inhuman deeds were rendered impotent and mute. Because all these ungodly feats were consummated by the hooligans of her nation-body as patriotic ventures that deserve to be preserved for posterity and the love for the land, the race and the faith. 

Once that gross misdemeanor was committed, those who followed the regimes of Sirimavo Bandaranaike, J R Jayewardene, R Premadasa, Chandrika Bandaranaike and up to Mahinda Rajapaksa, felt utterly free to indulge in the most indecent and unspeakable acts of high crimes and misdemeanor

By the time she reached fifty years after Independence, the gruesome process has evolved to be the norm instead an exception. With her profile so faded, a forlorn look in her eyes and all her hopes and dreams in ashes, she still keeps one single hope, a faint ray of desire to rise from the layers of rages heaped up in enmity, hatred and envy. In the modern world in which every guy and gal is having his or her ear glued to a Smartphone, she laments that her evolution has not embraced that phone-culture as yet. Her mere attachment to things that are more traditional and conventional has made her clumsy and slavish to things of the past that are mere concepts and not living organisms. 
That inherent lethargy as a historical fact as was proven time and again in her ancient glorious past and her disinterested slant to the currents of international and all-embracing technological advancements has cost her dearly; she may not have realized it, but that is the hard truth. To paraphrase Jawaharlal Nehru who in his celebrated book, The Discovery of India, himself quoting another great son of India, Rabindranath Tagore, wrote that all things of the past are dead and death-dealing. Each time she peeped into her ancient past, as someone close associated with psychiatry disclosed, she got something akin to an orgasmic relief, a relief so fleeting, the immediate aftermath of that relief made it look like a disguised agony calling for company. 
This unrelenting epic continues to date. The faked patriotism of Weerawansa and Gammanpila, thunderous shrieking by Dinesh and Aluthgamage and insalubrious and pathetic violation the body and soul of Mother Lanka by Mahinda Rajapaksa and his notorious family are beyond description. All these violations were there in her ancient history too. Those who chronicled her history, more often than not, alluded to the glorious events of war-victories, shattering of the enemys will and erection of magnificent Stupas, Dagabas and ocean-like tanks. The paintings in the Rock fortress Sigiri and Buddha statues in the Dambulla caves, of course, tell a calmness and serenity of a totally sublime and disciplined mind of a people. Such greatness is not subordinated by the massive irrigation networks that streamed life-giving waters to hungry and impatient lands downstream. These mind-boggling human achievements were not bested by any of the modern day rulers. Yet, as Tagore said, they are all dead and belong in the distant arena of past. 
With all due respect to D. S. Senanayake and his first Cabinet of Ministers, the apathetic regard they exhibited during the first few years of Independence towards the well-being of Mother Lanka was shaded with nuanced and subtle fine lines of Colonial artistry. However, the first of her violations began with a man called S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike, who for his inflated egoistic reasons and mad rush to power, floated the idea of Sinhala-only policy heralded by his five-pronged army- Sanga, Veda, Guru, Govi, Kamkaru (Sangha, Indigenous medical practitioner, Teacher, Farmer and Labourer). That idea became a potent force with real inflammatory sloganizing. Apart from a very positive and productive profile, this force contained within itself pent up emotions of an envious and angry adolescent. That adolescent, in his newly-found, yet misplaced courage, believed it was time to violate her who had just attained puberty. 

one simply cannot disregard nor forget the consummation of all these violations by the dawn of 2015

Once that gross misdemeanor was committed, those who followed the regimes of Sirimavo
Bandaranaike, J R Jayewardene, R Premadasa, Chandrika Bandaranaike and up to Mahinda Rajapaksa, felt utterly free to indulge in the most indecent and unspeakable acts of high crimes and misdemeanor. While all these dastardly violations were justified on the grounds of patriotism, the Damsel suffered the indignities of rape, terror, bullying, intimidation and butchery. 
Nevertheless, one simply cannot disregard nor forget the consummation of all these violations by the dawn of 2015. And sheer apathy which was shown in the process towards the rule of law was more vocal and robust in its exercise in the absence of decency. The rule of law became the law of rule. The sloganeers of the Rajapaksa regime, with their crafty and evil intentions, carried the shameless harassing of the land, the race and the faith. The gruesome acts of violence and silent nod rendered by the prelates of the Maha Sangha encouraged these hooligans to carry on with their inhumanities to their brethren, whether they came from the North or the South, the East or the West. A license to murder, harass, rape and loot was gleefully endorsed by the leaders of the Teachings of the first religious leader who taught Ahimsa, (non-violence), Siddhartha Gautama Buddha.
Our Great Chronicle says that Prince Gamini (before he was coronated as Duttha-Gamini) refused to lie on his bed with his arms and legs freely spread out. The reason he gave was that when the Tamils in the North and the Indian Ocean in the South are threateningly invasive, how could he possibly sleep freely. The venom and anger contained in these words are still echoing deeply in the ears of extremists whose misplaced sense of patriotism is providing sufficient fuel to convert that patriotism into slaughter and dismemberment of a fellow countryman. 
Ethnic violence and ethnic discrimination has taken deep root in the psyche of the adolescent who has now reached his middle age. His propensities for violence and mayhem may have cooled down; his anger and venom may have reached its peak over a couple of decades ago, yet his dormant enmity and rage is like ember beneath the ashes. The slightest of dog whistle could rekindle that flame; the faintest of signal is sufficient to call to arms. 
In this convolution of national character, how can I rest in peace, the damsel pleads. An epic transformation is obligatory. A total calibration of the fine traces of character is long overdue. Rehabilitation of his soul must accompany the recalibertion and the transformation, if not, all purpose of the exercise becomes redundant, for the foe and friend of our land become one and the same and the foe overpowering the friend is inevitable. 
Until this marvel happens, it is required of the national profile to be polite, at least for the sake of decency and decorum. For the damsel is in deep distress

Death penalty a red herring: JO
	
The Joint Opposition (JO) yesterday said the Government would never implement the death penalty and that the topic had been introduced to divert the attention of the public from pressing issues.
JO MP Mahinda Yapa Abeywardane said the Government had no strength to implement the death penalty.
This Government waver to the demands of the international forces. It would never implement the capital punishment. This is yet another topic put forward by the Government to hide pressing issues- such as the Central Bank Bond Scam -under the carpet, he said.
He said drug smuggling in the country was being done with State patronage in some instances, as heroin had been found concealed in bags which bear the name Sathosa.
Killing drug smugglers, who are convicted is not the answer. This is an extensive network, which involves Government bigwigs. The Government is not capable of eradicating this menace, he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Death penalty : Govt. hangs on despite debate on execution plan
	

The death penalty will be imposed on some 1,090 prisoners if this decision comes to effect
Church of Ceylon said it cannot condone the move to resume the execution of both those sentenced to death for drug related
Apart from hanging, beheading, lethal injection and shooting are also used as execution methods in the world
Meanwhile, the Department had also separated the convicted drug traffickers from other inmates to cutoff their supplies


No one in the world is impeccable. Everybody makes mistakes. Its the nature of human beings to commit mistakes. These mistakes can be classified either venial mistakes or grave mistakes. Some grave mistakes like killing, raping, drug trafficking and aborting etc. deserve grave penalties.

Overview of death penalty

Wikipedia highlights that Capital punishment, also known as the death penalty, is a government-sanctioned practice whereby a person is killed by the state as the punishment for a crime. 
According to the Death Penalty Information Center (DPIC) which is a national non-profit organization serving the media and the public with analysis and information on issues related to capital punishment, 56 countries are using the death penalty at present while 142 countries have removed the death penalty in law or in practice. 
Amnesty International reports that 23 countries carried out at least 993 executions last year (2017) which is less compared to the figure in 2016 that read as 1,032. The number of executions in 2015 was 1,634. However, the real figure is likely to be much higher. 
China remained the worlds top executioner, but the true extent of the use of the death penalty in China is unknown as this data is classified as a state secret. 
Amnesty International highlights that the death penalty breaches human rights, in particular the right to life and the right to live free from torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. Both rights are protected under the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, adopted by the UN in 1948. 
Apart from hanging, beheading, lethal injection and shooting are also used as execution methods in the world. 

Sri Lanka to resume death penalty

The death penalty has a long history in Sri Lanka. The British restricted the death penalty after they took control of the island in 1815 to the crimes of murder and waging war against the King. 
After independence, then Prime Minister S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike abolished capital punishment in 1956. However, it was reintroduced after his assassination in 1959. 
Records show that the year 1976 marked the last occasion when a person was subject to the death penalty in Sri Lanka. 
The Cabinet of ministers has recently discussed imposing death penalty on drug traffickers, including prisoners who were already sentenced to death. 
President Maithripala Sirisena stated on July 11 that he will endorse the plans to begin capital punishment following an alarming rise in the drug trade. 
He noted that drug racketeers, who were convicted and serving jail terms, were continuing with their operations while in prison and called on the Justice Ministry to provide the names of individuals who had been sentenced to death regarding drug-related crimes. 

A violation of human rights

Speaking to the Daily Mirror, former Human Rights Commissioner and senior lecturer at the Colombo University Law Faculty Dr. Prathiba Mahanamahewa said that imposing the death penalty on anyone was a grave violation of human rights. 

		
			Dr. Prathiba Mahanamahewa
			
		
			
			
			We have also pledged to the United Nations not to impose the death penalty on anyone due to ethical and moral concerns. The year 1976 marked the last occasion when a Sri Lankan was subject to the death penalty
			
			
		







Dr. Mahanamahewa said that during the tenure of former President J.R. Jayewardene, Sri Lanka had signed and ratified the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, through which right to life was recognised and protected. 
Although we signed the multilateral treaty, we have not ratified the Second Optional Protocol to the covenant which envisages the abolition of the death penalty. Therefore, the Government can impose the capital punishment though its a grave violation of the right to life. Dr. Mahanamahewa said.
We have also pledged to the United Nations not to impose the death penalty on anyone due to ethical and moral concerns. The year 1976 marked the last occasion when a Sri Lankan was subject to the death penalty. The death penalty will be imposed on some 1,090 prisoners if this decision comes to effect, Dr. Mahanamahewa added. 
However, he said it was important to ascertain from where these drugs are smuggled in, than to impose capital punishment on people. 
There are top officials involved in large-scale drug trafficking. The Government should take action against them immediately, he said. Nevertheless, he said even the countries that have legalized capital punishment, have not been able to control the drug trafficking or condense murders and rape cases. 

There is more to be done

Archbishop of Colombo Diocese Malcolm Cardinal Ranjith told a news briefing that there is more to be done to stop the criminals organising crimes while being in the prison in addition to subjecting them to capital punishment. 

		
			Malcolm Cardinal Ranjith
			
		
			
			
			We understand that even prison officers also support the criminals to organise crime while in prison and therefore its our belief that political leadership of the country should carry out investigations
			
			
			
		







We will support President Maithripala Sirisenas decision to subject those who organise crime while being in the prison to a death sentence, but we also feel that there is more to be done, Cardinal Ranjith said. 
We understand that even prison officers also support the criminals to organise crime while in prison and therefore its our belief that political leadership of the country should carry out investigations and penalize the prison officers as well if they are found to have helped the inmates to carry out various crimes, he added.

Executives consent shouldnt be a need

Attorney-at-law Nagananda Kodituwakku said that the death penalty should be implemented for drug traffickers. 
He told the Daily Mirror that it was good to enforce the death penalty, but the executive branch should not interfere in this affair other than during exceptional circumstances. 
We have seen instances where the Executive unduly interferes into implementing the death penalty. The consent of the Executive should not be a requirement in forming the verdict for a death penalty on a convict.

			The consent of the Executive should not be a requirement in forming the verdict for a death penalty on a convict. It has to be decided in and through a court procedure without the interference of anybody
			
			
			
		








It has to be decided in and through a court procedure without the interference of anybody, Kodituwakku said. 
The majority of the prisoners are those who are involved in drug trafficking. Therefore, there should be an end to drugs which have become a huge threat to the country, Kodituwakku added. 
He added that even under the Customs Ordinance, its underscored that the death penalty should be handed to drug traffickers who are involved in large scale drug trafficking. 
Further, Kodituwakku said that the death penalty should also be applicable for any person who has been convicted of death under the Penal Code of Sri Lanka. 

No to death penalty

Prof. Ven. MedagodaAbayathissa Thera said that he was opposed to resuming death penalty. 
We are taught in the Buddhism not kill the person, but kill the fault. In that viewpoint, we are against this move. There is a lot to be done before bringing the death penalty,Abayathissa Thera said. 
Its necessary to find out the root causes for the existence of drugs and how they enter the country, the monk added. 
Abayathissa Thera said that the death penalty is carried out by failed states and added Sri Lanka had also fallen into that category. 

		
			Ven. MedagodaAbayathissa Thera
			
		
			
			
			We are taught in the Buddhism not kill the person, but kill the fault. In that viewpoint, we are against this move. Priority should not be given to killing those who are involved in drug trafficking, but to ways and means to eradicate drugs from the society
			
			
			
		








Priority should not be given to killing those who are involved in drug trafficking, but to ways and means to eradicate drugs from the society, the Thera added. 
Abayathissa Thera said that if the Government would impose the death penalty on those who organise crimes while being in the prison, it underscores inefficiency and bureaucracy on the part of the Prison Department, in their deals with inmates. 
Meanwhile, The Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka (HRCSL) in a letter addressed to President Maithripala Sirisena had requested to revoke his decision to enforce the capital punishment on drug traffickers and implement a powerful and long-term policy framework for the suppression of grave crimes, including drug trafficking.
The delegation of the European Union in Sri Lanka as well as the diplomatic missions of Canada and Norway have written to President Sirisena to verify the worrying information in the public domain about the intention of the Government of Sri Lanka (GoSL) to resume implementing the death penalty. 
At the same time, the Church of Ceylon (Anglican Church) on Monday said it was against the death penalty and instead called on the Government to vigorously combat drug smuggling and distribution at all levels in the society. 
Issuing a statement, the Church of Ceylon said it cannot condone the move to resume the execution of both those sentenced to death for drug related crimes and inmates continuing to be involved in the drug trade while in prison. 

List of 18 convicts released

Prisons Spokesman Commissioner Thushara Upuldeniya said a list consisting names of 18 convicts, who were sentenced to death for drug-related crimes, was submitted to the Justice and Prison Reforms Ministry on July 13. 
He said the security within the Prisons had been beefed up to curb drug smuggling by convicted drug traffickers. 
He said the Prison Department had also limited the meals brought by outsiders to be given to such inmates, to prevent communication.
Meanwhile, the Department had also separated the convicted drug traffickers from other inmates to cutoff their supplies and connections with the outside world and other inmates. 
According to the measures taken, the Department hoped to expand its intelligence and equip Prison Officers with better equipment. 
Commissioner Upuldeniya added that the Department had planned to launch an awareness campaign targeting convicted drug traffickers to educate them over the harm created through drugs and discourage them from being involved in drug-trafficking. 

woman prisoner headed the list of the criminals, on death row, Justice and Prison Reforms Minister Thalata Athukorala

Justice and Prison Reforms Minister Thalata Athukorala airing her views at an event held in Kahawatta on Monday said that a woman prisoner headed the list of the criminals, on death row. They are to be hung. 
The Minister also said that the country had already become a drug trafficking hub when the unity Government assumed power.
Meanwhile, the Prison Department announced last week, that it had called for applications to recruit two hangmen to carry out executions. 
The department hired two hangmen in 2015, but they later resigned. 
The Department spokesman said it had been a difficult task to recruit a hangman as most of them quit due to stress. 
In conclusion, its apt to pose the question whether the Government has taken adequate steps to check the proliferation of drugs before starting the practice of using the death penalty.

Defiant Trump calls his Putin summit a great success
	

President Trump has called his Helsinki summit with Vladimir Putin a huge success just hours after saying that he misspoke when he said he saw no reason to believe Russia had interfered in the 2016 US election. 
A defiant Trump tweeted Tuesday night that the meeting between President Putin and myself was a great success, except in the Fake News Media! 
It came just hours after he spoke directly to cameras on Tuesday afternoon in an effort to blunt criticism of a press conference with Putin at which he let the Russian president off the hook for election interference. 
Glancing at a printed statement that he had marked up with hand-written edits throughout his remarks, Trump said he accepts his intelligence communitys assessment that Russia meddled in the election - although it could be other people also - and said he meant to say yesterday that he had no reason to doubt the professionals within his administration. 
I accept our intelligence community conclusion that Russian meddling in the 2016 election took place, Trump said. Could be other people also, a lot of people out there, he added. Theres no collusion at all. 
Trump said he was surprised by the firestorm that awaited him when he arrived on Monday in Washington and realized he needed to clear up his comments after reviewing the transcript of his presser with Putin. The president said that he has the greatest respect for his intelligence chiefs.

The sentence should have been, I dont see any reason why it wouldnt be Russia, Trump said. So you can put that in. I think that probably clarifies things pretty good by itself.

FB to remove misinformation following episodes in SL
	
Facebook, which faces growing criticism for posts that have incited violence in some countries including Sri Lanka, said Wednesday that it would begin removing misinformation that could lead to violence, the New York Times reported.
The policy expands Facebooks rules about what type of false information it will remove, and is largely a response to episodes in Sri Lanka, Myanmar and India in which rumors that spread on Facebook led to real-world attacks on ethnic minorities.
We have identified that there is a type of misinformation that is shared in certain countries that can incite underlying tensions and lead to physical harm offline. We have a broader responsibility to not just reduce that type of content but remove it,a Facebook product manager Tessa Lyons said.
Facebook has been roundly criticized over the way its platform has been used to spread hate speech and false information that prompted violence.
The company has struggled to balance its belief in free speech with those concerns, particularly in countries where access to the internet is relatively new and there are limited mainstream news sources to counter social media rumors.
In Myanmar, Facebook has been accused by United Nations investigators and human rights groups of facilitating violence against Rohingya Muslims, a minority ethnic group, by allowing anti-Muslim hate speech and false news.
In Sri Lanka, riots broke out after false news pitted the countrys majority Buddhist community against Muslims. Near-identical social media rumors have also led to attacks in India and Mexico. In many cases, the rumors included no call for violence, but amplified underlying tensions.
The new rules apply to one of Facebooks other big social media properties, Instagram, but not to WhatsApp, where false news has also circulated. In India, for example, false rumors spread through WhatsApp about child kidnappers have led to mob violence.
Under the new rules, Facebook said it would create partnerships with local civil society groups to identify misinformation for removal. The new rules are already being put in effect in Sri Lanka, and Ms. Lyons said the company hoped to soon introduce them in Myanmar, then expand elsewhere.
The company has started identifying posts that are categorized as false by independent fact checkers. Facebook will downrank those posts, effectively moving them down in each users News Feed so that they are not highly promoted across the platform.
When asked in an interview how Facebook defined misinformation that could lead to harm and should be removed versus that material it would simply downrank because it was objectionable, Ms. Lyons said, There is not always a really clear line.
All of this is challenging  that is why we are iterating. That is why we are taking serious feedback,she said.
Facebook has disclosed its rules and guidelines

Feeding alcohol to toddler: Father says it was water in the bottle
	
The father of the baby, who was seen in a social media video, feeding it with a beer bottle, told court yesterday that it was water that was in the bottle and not alcohol, as charged.
Four men, including the 40-year-old father of a baby, who had been believed to have fed an alcoholic beverage to a toddler, had been remanded till August 1 by the Galgamuwa Magistrate yesterday.
However, the father maintained that it was water.
The Maegalawa Police yesterday arrested the suspects after the video went viral on social media.
The video shows the father, keeping the 13-month old baby when drinking with his friends and feeding the contents of the bottle to the toddler.
The suspects, aged between 23 and 50 and residents of Meegalawa, were remanded on charges of child cruelty.
Meanwhile, the father of the toddler informed the court that it was water, which was in the bottle and not an alcoholic beverage.
However, the Police produced the said bottle to the court and said there was evidence that it was beer, that was inside the bottle.
The toddler also has been produced for a medical test before the Anuradhapura Judicial Medical Officer (JMO) on Monday.
The Police said they were waiting for a detailed report from the JMO. (Darshana Sanjeewa)

Giving Mattala Airport to India dangerous: JVP
	
Transferring the Mattala International Airport to India was a threat to the national security and the sovereignty of the country as airports played an important part in domestic and international wars, Chief Opposition Whip and JVP leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake said today.
He told Parliament that transferring of the ownership of the airport just because it was a loss-making venture should be thoroughly considered.
"Issues with national interest should be considered than losses or economic benefits of the airport. An airport is important in military affairs in a country. It can pose more threat to national security and sovereignty of the country," he said.
Raising a question, Mr Dissanayake asked whether the Government would present the agreement in Parliament.
Civil Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala De Silva said discussions were in progress to develop Mattala Airport as a Joint Venture with India and that the Government would follow the due procedure before signing the agreement.
He said the agreement would be presented in Parliament before signing it and added that the ownership of the airport could not be transferred to a foreign country completely according to the Civil Aviation Act.
"If the airport is to be transferred to India completely, Civil Aviation Act should be amended in Parliament. Then anyone can object it and defeat it in Parliament," he said.
The Minister said the Government decided to develop the Mattala Airport as a Joint Venture due to its unbearable debt burden and losses and added that Indian Civil Aviation Authority offered to develop it.
"We called for open proposals from local and international businessmen. But only India submitted a feasible proposal," he said.
Mr De Silva said Joint Venture would be formed where 70 per cent of its shares would be bought by India while the other 30 per cent by the Government.
"Discussions were in progress by the Technical Evaluation Committee and a negotiating committee on matters regarding national security and the job security of employees of the airport.
"We have set pre-conditions before transferring the airport. This is only a business venture. We will not allow anyone to use it for any military activities. Its air navigation system is operated by Sri Lankan authorities and security also provided by the Air Force and local partners," he said.(Ajith Siriwardana and Yohan Perera)

GMOA threaten countrywide work stoppage next week
	
The Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) today said they would launch a countrywide work stoppage next week, if the authorities concerned do not provide them with reasonable solutions to issues faced by them, during coming days.
GMOA Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge told a news conference that their central committee, that met today, had vested its executive committee with the powers to decide on a date to launch the work stoppage after considering the response of President Maithripala Sirisena and Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne to their demands.
He said the GMOA had nearly ten demands that needed to be resolved which include issues related to the delay in increasing the disturbance, availability and transport (DAT) allowance paid to medical officers.
Our other demands are; the government should issue a gazette notification on minimum standards of medical education already approved by the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) and actions should be taken to solve the issues with regard to the Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with Sri Lanka and Singapore, he said.
Amendments should be made to the Inland Revenue (IR) Act, which is detrimental to professionals. There are many issues that remain unresolved particularly with regard to the schooling of doctors children and the Education Ministry headed by Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam, he added.
He said the GMOA had informed the authorities concerned, including President Sirisena, about these issues on several occasions and added that they would wait for another two to three days for a positive response from the authorities with regards to their demands before deciding on their next course of action.

How music aids cure
	
Music has a Therapeutic value.I am a teacher of Western Music and English with 40 years of experience. Even now, I send pupils for London Examinations. I have taught in popular and less affluent schools, mostly in the Southern Province. 
Now I am in my sixties and I lead a solitary life. I never feel lonely, so long as I play the piano or the electric organ and when I listen to the C.D. player (specially classical and 20th century Music). Then I start playing the melody without looking at the notations. It takes hours and hours. I feel happy and forget all my woes. Depression no more. Its a remedial measure for me every now and then. I forget all my aches and pains. 
The youngest student who comes to my Western Music class is nearly seven years. She joined my class very recently after having studied under another teacher. She used to cry and was depressed. She hated studying theory. When she joined my class, she had torn her theory book into pieces. Slowly I consoled her and got her to do theory in an interesting way. Now she can play the piano well and will be sitting for the London Music examination early next year. She is an adorable little girl. Sometimes I have heard her singing all by herself, while doing Theory. 
My mother (Thelma Saranasena who is a retired English teacher of Mahinda College, Galle) passed away five years back at the age of 91. She wasnt bedridden during the final stages of her life. Whenever she was in pain she would ask me to play the piano or to switch on the C.D. player to listen to light music. She used to feel a relief in a few seconds.


Whispering Hope

I can recollect my western music teacher (Miss Trixie Dias Abeygunawardene who was a retired teacher from Sangamitta College, Galle), who passed away recently at the age of 91. During the final stages of her life she was in a luxurious Elders Home in Moratuwa. One day when I went to see her, she was all alone in her room looking at the bare walls and singing all by herself. She was singing the song Whispering Hope and she asked me to join in. She was lonely yet, she was happy. 
I felt so sorry that I tried not to cry in front of her. It was a Christian home for the elders and there was a piano in the sitting room, for anyone who wished to play. Later she refused to play it because she probably recollected how she taught her own pupils and trained the school choir, Day and Night (I too was in the choir). 
Even the practice of chanting pirith is done is such a way now that people without their knowledge listen to it, rather than listen to long sermons where the speaker preaches for hours. 
In some countries people use to do exercises rhythmically, so that they could avoid illnesses such as arthritis. 
Even some schools in Sri Lanka adopted this method (rhythmic exercises to music), especially early in the morning before classroom work commenced. Its a variation for the children and they forget the stress caused by the unending learning process. 
I adopted this in the Advanced Level class during my English period. They were tired of listening to unending lectures throughout the day and sometimes brought stress upon them making them restless. There are some lessons included in the text book as motivational exercises. The children were singing together  songs like the famous Titanic song. They all love to sing that song, specially the boys, and they are happy to do the English lesson, thereafter. 
This is my own experience which I had very recently. I had to undergo surgery. That was my second operation. I am a Buddhist, but I have a Christian background. I sang Hymns when I was in the school (Southlands College, Galle) as a student. 
When I was taken to the operating Theatre, the only thing that came in to my mind was the crucifixion of Jesus Christ and the famous song  Lord Jesus Christ you are all alone on the cross. In a few seconds I was unconscious. I never knew what had happened. The pain relieved slowly after I gained consciousness. It was a miracle!
Whenever I feel depressed I hum this song or play it on the piano. I forget all my aches and pains. 
The second surgical operation was done by the consultant surgeon, senior lecturer in surgery Dr. J.P.M. Kumarasinghe, who is attached to the Teaching Hospital in Karapitiya, Galle. 
I am grateful to both doctors. I must thank Dr. Krishantha Jayasekara, consultant physician  Base Hospital Balapitiya- for saving my life. I say this because when I was admitted to the hospital I was seriously ill. I hope, both of them, will be able to cure many more patients like me in future. 
All these are my life experiences. And I know that there is a therapeutic value in music. I dont know whether your will agree with me or not. It is up to you to decide. . (Retired teacher)

Human Rights Council is UNs greatest failure: US
	
United States Ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley on Wednesday said the Human Rights Council was the UN's greatest failure.
She expressed these views while discussing the United States withdrawal from the UNHumanRights Council,at the Heritage Foundation in Washington DC.
Judged by how far it has fallen short of its promise, the Human Rights Council is the UN's greatest failure.It has taken the idea of human dignity. The Councilhas reduced it to just another instrument of international politicswhichis a great tragedy, she said.
She said the United States withdrawal from the Human Rights Council does not mean that they give up thefight for reform.
On the contrary, any country willing to work with us to reshape the Council need only ask.America can no more abandon the cause of human rights than abandon itself. It is who we are. It is who were proud to be. And its who we will always be, Ambassador Haley said.
She said no one should make the mistake of equating membership in the Human Rights Council with the support for human rights.
She also said the US does more for human rights, both inside the UN andaround the world, than any other country.
We will continue to do that. We just wont do it inside a Council that consistently fails the cause of human rights, she said.

Inform before holding ministerial meetings: Reginald to CS
	
Northern Province Governor Reginald Cooray on Tuesday advised Northern Province Chief Secretary (CS) A. Pathinathan not to hold any ministerial meetings without informing him first.
The Governor issued this order considering the difficulties that had arisen due to the issuance of the Interim injunction by the Appeals Court staying the removal of P. Deniswaran as Provincial Minister of Fisheries and Transport.
The fact that Northern Province Chief Minister Wigneswaran had neglected to do the necessary alterations to the list of Provincial Ministers in the Northern Province in accordance with the court order was said to have caused the chaotic situation.
Chief Secretary Pathinathan had brought to the notice of the Governor that there were now six ministers attending council meetings after the re-instatement of Provincial Minister P. Deniswaran which had complicated matters. He had requested for advice from the NP Governor last Wednesday (12) on how to proceed. (F. Aslam)

Its My duty to save Lives The story of Yukio Shige
	

Sometimes you feel so low in your life that you have no energy to move ahead. The only option may be giving up. This could be due to many factors including depression, loss of a loved one or the lack of a support system. However much we think we could stand up on our own feet, sometimes we need someone to hold us and give us a little push. Sometimes you may pick up cues from which you could realise if one is sad or not and taking a little bit of effort to put them back on track is a heroic act.
Yukio Shige, a 70-year old retired police officer from Japan has saved over 500 lives to date. Japan has been ranked as a country with one of the highest rates of suicide and with individuals like Shige these rates could be lowered. As a practice, Shige patrols the Tojinbo cliffs on the Sea of Japan with three other volunteers, keeping a lookout for, and speaking to people contemplating ending their life. Speaking to the Independent  UK Shige explains the pain he has gone through in dealing with suicide. I have seen so much grief. I dont wish to hear anymore mourning, he said. With a pair of binoculars, Shige observes the nooks and crannies of Tojinbo in his daily search.

Shige was also featured on the documentary series 101 East on Al Jazeera, a weekly current affairs television programme that focuses on Asia, its diverse cultures and conflicting politics. In his documentary Shige relates the challenges he faces in tracking people who are depressed. The numerous suicides that have taken place at Tojinbo have made it a tourist destination today and the large numbers of tourists it attracts daily adds to the challenge.
Speaking in the documentary Shige says that it is important to observe their emotions. Sometimes, people who contemplate ending their lives keep staring at the sea, Shige added. They are lost in deep thought and some are engaged in conversations, that even if one eavesdrops, they wouldnt notice. We take those who want our help to the six apartments we own so that they can repair and rebuild their lives. We help them get their lives back.

We all have various challenges to face in life and everyone will not have the equal amount of courage and support to face them.
If you observe some change in a person, if they prefer being isolated, have lost their appetite and show similar behaviours, always be by their side. If these behaviours continue over a period, refer them to a psychologist or a support group that will help to bring him or her out of the darkness.
Several local organisations such as Sumithrayo are geared to help those in despair.

Light as a feather
	
Most of us would love to grow wings and fly away but this lazy bird decided not to use its flying abilities and instead hitched a lift on the back of an eagle.
Stunning pictures show the eagle resting on a branch in Taipei, Taiwan, as it tried to eat a snake.
A smaller black drongo bird then swoops down from the sky before landing on the back of the Crested Serpent Eagle as wildlife photographer Liu Chia-Pin was taking pictures.
The small bird was brooding and so attacked and drove the invaders, constantly attacking in the trees or in the air. He even stood on the back of this mammoth eagle as it was flying away.'
The black drongo species is known for its aggressive behaviour towards much larger birds and has been given the nickname 'king crow' for dive-bombing any bird of prey that enters its territory. (Daily Mail)

Mandela and Obama
	
What counts in life is not the mere fact that we have lived. It is what difference we have made to the lives of others that will determine the significance of the life we lead Nelson Mandela
The above quote was on the invitation that the South African mission here sent to media requesting them to join the centenary birth celebration of Nelson Mandela that was held yesterday at the Independence Square. 
It was quite coincidental that the centenary observations in Sri Lanka coincided with the tour of the South African cricket team and their presence at the event no doubt added more colour to the occasion. Despite the rout at the First Test match with a record low, the South African team members had been seen cheerfully mingling with the gathering at the event to commemorate the leader for whom their country is best known.
The world still clearly recalls the presence of the Father of Reconciliation till a few years back with the world leaders scrambling to shake hands with him. As such to think that the day of his centenary birthday has dawned this soon is not an idea that every one of us can reconcile with. However it has come. Mandela lived a good 95 years to set one of the best examples of a human life in modern history and the world cannot thank enough for their good fortune of seeing a leader of his calibre in their life time.
In a world where political leaders clamber up shamelessly to seize power for powers sake Mandelas lone example has made him almost a political saint, a type of a leader some think the world may not see once again. Another may say that perhaps there would not be a need for a Mandela model again with the availability of enough and more laws against racial discrimination. 
However signs are there that this may not to be the case.
The effects of climate change, growing food shortages and global economic instability are gradually making the people go back to their roots. The fight for limited resources has seen re-emergence xenophobia in the United States and Europe where the white supremacists are gaining ground once again deafening the moderate voice.
The politics of fear and resentment and retrenchment began to appear. And that kind of politics is now on the move. Its on the move at a pace that would have seemed unimaginable just a few years ago, Barack Obama has said delivering the centenary oration of Nelson Mandela in South African capital Johannesburg.The first African-American president of the United States, whose election many of us thought heralded a new era in the story of the United States, certainly has reasons to worry. Donald Trump has turned the progress of the US, in terms of racial reconciliation, upside down. I am not being alarmist. Im simply stating the facts. Look around  strongman politics are ascendant, suddenly, whereby elections and some pretence of democracy are maintained, the form of it, where those in powers seek to undermine every institution or norm that gives democracy meaning Obama said in a direct reference to President Donald Trump at the event which had an audience of nearly 15,000 people.
Reminding the composition of the FIFA champions, the multi-coloured French team, Obama saidJust look at the French football team. Not all of those folks looked like Gauls to me, but they are French - they are French.Underscoring the point that a society where equality is ensured can draw talent and strength from all to make a better society he had declared that racism still exists in the United States as well as South Africa.
Surely its a long walk before we see the world that Nelson Mandela envisioned.

## Title: Names from outside Rajapaksa family considered for Presidential Candidate - Basil

Names from outside Rajapaksa family considered for Presidential Candidate - Basil
	

I have stopped talking about Presidential Elections
	
	It is up to the former President to decide
	
	I dont think he will take a hasty decision
	
	All sectors of the economyin ruins
	
	Will not comment on donation to Pushpa Rajapaksa Foundation due to legal reasons

Former Economic Development Minister Basil Rajapaksa, in an interview withDaily Mirror,speaks about the presidential election, the status of the economy and the governments tax policy.

Q There are a lot of talks about the Presidential Election. There are differences of opinion on the candidate to be selected from your side. Who is the candidate in your mind
I do not think a seasoned politician like former President Mahinda Rajapaksa will take a hasty decision. There are more than 450 days left for the elections. I do not think he will take a decision at such an early stage. In the past, such decisions were arrived at after much calculation and deliberation. It was done after much consultation with the organizations and people involved. We have to follow a proper procedure to decide on the presidential candidate who is supposed to represent numerous parties and organizations. The former President will decide on everything at the right time through the procedure. There is a time for it. As Buddhists, we have heard about five big considerations (Pas Maha Belum) made for a Buddha to be born. 

QYour name is also floated as a prospective candidate. The names of former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa and former Speaker Chamal Rajapaksa are mentioned. Do you have presidential ambitions
I have no such dream at all. People express different views. They are entitled to their views in this regard. It means there are a number of eligible persons. Actually, there are some other names being mentioned as presidential candidates other than the ones you mentioned. They do not even belong to the Rajapaksa family. 

There are more than 450 days left for the elections. I do not think he will take a decision at such an early stage

Q Who are them from outside the Rajapaksa family
I do not wish to mention them openly. I have stopped talking about presidential candidates. The only thing is that the former President should decide on it. Only he has been given the right to decide on the candidate finally after consulting everyone concerned. 

Q In your view, what are the qualifications the possible candidate should possess
Again, it is up to the former President to look at. 

QBut, your party Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) is calling the shots in the opposition. Therefore, you must be having some views inthis regard
We do not spend time on such matters these days. Our primary focus is to build pressure on the government to stop its agenda harmful to the country. The government is doing certain things harmful to the country by enacting fresh legislations. Some international agreements, being signed, have a bearing on the country. The local economy is in tatters. Free education and healthcare are on the decline. The agriculture sector is in ruins. The industries have collapsed. We want to stop further damage being done during the remaining period of this government. 

Q Does it mean you will undo certain legislations if your partycomes to power
That is also being considered. Certain economic nerve centres had been privatized by the governments of former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga and R. Premadasa. They had been sold for a pittance. Our government took steps to reclaim them after 2005. We did so by moving court in some instances. Also, we acquired some assets through negotiations. We paid huge compensations to take over some of them. The former President is a leader withsuch experience. 
We are discussing similar steps to be taken next time. We remain alert on the alienation of public assets, bilateral agreements being signed and transactions taking place. 
Let alone, we cannot forget the fact that some of these transactions are bound by international treaties. If it is a bilateral agreement, it will be far more serious to rescind it in the future. If it is an agreement with a foreign company, it will be less serious though. We live in a globalized world. We have to look at all these aspects. Bilateral agreements are bound by international treaties. Therefore, they become international agreements. It is difficult to abrogate such agreements, come what may. 
The recently signed Free Trade Agreement with Singapore even covers Prima Company which is a previous Singaporean investment in Sri Lanka. Singapore does not produce rice. Yet, there are a number of rice producing countries in ASEAN- Vietnam, Thailand and Philippines. If such rice enters our market through the FTA with Singapore, it will affect our rice farmers. Rice cultivation is not merely a source of income. It is, in fact, linked with our culture. 

Q Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa said that India was the country that could make the biggest political impact on Sri Lanka. Is there any new plan to engage India
I dont think of it as a topic to be discussed openly. If there is anything like that, we will pay attention to it. 
People here want former President Mahinda Rajapaksa as their leader. Yet, there are legal barriers for him to contest. The United National Party (UNP) introduced the current executive presidential system assuming that it could never be defeated. So far, seven presidential elections had been conducted. The UNP lost four of them. The UNP won only three including the 2015 elections. Even J.R. Jayewardene was not sure of winning the presidential election in 1982 with Sirimavo Bandaranaike as his rival candidate. As a result, she was stripped of her civic rights. The UNP eliminated its potential threats that way. They did the same this time. They created a hurdle for Mr. Mahinda Rajapaksa though people wanted him. I personally believe his leadership is needed for this country for another five years. Since there is a legal barrier for him to contest, we will nominate another in his place. 

Our primary focus is to build pressure on the government to stop its agenda harmful to the country

Q Recently, Tamil National Alliance (TNA) leader R. Sampanthan said the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) had been dispensed with by the SLPP. What is your view as the one who spearheads it
His speech is full of contradictions. He is also responsible for the destruction of the Federal Party formed by S.J.V. Chelvanayagam. As the time warranted, S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike defected from the UNP and formed the SLFP. Be that as it may, the SLFP has been made an appendage of the UNP by its present leadership today. Yet, we, the SLPP, stand for the original principles and polices espoused by the SLFP formed by Mr. Bandaranaike. The SLFP has abdicated its historical duty and responsibility. Instead, we are doing it. We are reaching out to all the communities. It has become a problem for Mr. Sampanthan. We directly address people in the north and east. Only the SLPP cherishes the founding ideals of the SLFP. We only gave political authority to people in the north and east by establishing provincial councils. Today, the TNA has acted to deny provincial administration in the east. The north is also likely to lose it in September. Mr. Sampanthan insists on the demand for the new constitution. That is a ploy to get the provincial council elections postponed. 
In fact, we established the northern provincial council and made way for Chief Minister C.V. Wigneswaran to take decisions with regard to public affairs.

Q In your view, what will be the role of the SLFP at the presidential elections
If the government conducts the provincial council elections first, we will be able to see the predicament of the SLFP.

Q Earlier, there were talks about a change of government. Why do you try to bring about a change of government by securing parliamentary majority ahead of the presidential elections
The SLPP has no parliamentary representation. We have the largest representation in local bodies. We will win over the provincial councils in the future. Even now, we have the largest number of provincial council members. We will only team up with the Joint Opposition when it comes to parliamentary affairs. 

Q What is your political advice to those in the Joint Opposition
Actually, they are more politically savvy than us. We only implement the decisions taken by them on the ground. 


The former President will decide on everything at the right time throughthe procedure
	
	Certain economic nerve centres had been privatized by the governments of former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga and R. Premadasa
	
	Some of these transactions are bound by international treaties. If it is a bilateral agreement, it will be far more serious to rescind it in the future
	
	We are going to tie up with JVPers and UNPers at village level


Q There is opposition to the accommodation of some members from the SLFP in the Joint Opposition. This is especially relevant to MP Dayasiri Jayasekara. What is your stand on the accommodation of these MPs from the SLFP
That issue has been sorted out. There is no distinct group with the SLFP identity now. They work with the Joint Opposition. Also, they collaborate with the SLPP. There are issues. I also have my views. These are being discussed internally. 

Q How do you react to the government MPs switching allegiance to the opposition in this manner
We won the local government elections. We need to increase our vote base to win the presidential elections. We have to win over fresh votes from among voters already registered in Sri Lanka. Otherwise, we cannot import votes. We try to attract votes. 
There are 1.4 million people who voted for the SLFP- led UPFA at the local government elections. These people are ideologically close to us. We have taken action to attract them. Some voted for the UPFA because it was the ruling party. Others voted for the UPFA in certain cases over the individual popularity of candidates in the fray. There are those who are spiritually attached to the SLFP. We need to pay attention to them. 

Q How big is the segment of voters who are so attached to the party
It differs from area to area. In some instances, the UPFA got votes at the behest of the sister parties aligned with it. It won the Kattankudy Urban Council because of Minister A.L.M. Hizbullah. The UPFA won similarly in some other areas thanks to MP Arumugam Thondaman and former Minister A.L.M. Athaullah. The individual popularity of some candidates also mattered in certain cases. We have to reach out to these parties.
We are going to tie up with JVPers and UNPers at village level. 

Q In case, President Maithripala Sirisena offered to team up with you at the next election, will you accommodate him
I do not wish to respond to hypothetical questions. Lets see when that eventuality arises!
The government set a world record by destroying a country within a short span of time. Certain areas of the economy have been damaged beyond redemption. The entire desiccated coconut industry has collapsed, even losing the export market. The gold industry is another. Those who manufacture joss sticks have also suffered a lot. The agriculture sector is in ruins, be it food crop cultivation or cash crop cultivation. 

Even J.R. Jayewardene was not sure of winning the presidential election in 1982 with Sirimavo Bandaranaike as his rival candidate. As a result, she was stripped of her civic rights. The UNP eliminated its potential threats that way. They did the same this tim

Q There is criticism over the recent tax hikes. Taxation is needed to increase state revenue. Your party argues against the tax hike. How do you manage state revenue with less taxation
We did it nicely. We reduced direct taxation during our time. There was a school of thought that direct taxes should be raised to gain revenue for the state to be invested. Besides, we reduced such taxes instead. We wanted to strengthen our businessmen. Then, their taxable income also improves. It is always needed to improve individual family economies. Then, their purchasing power improves. They increase their purchases of various consumer and luxury items. In such a context, we can get revenue by way of indirect taxes imposed on the items they purchase using their newly gained wealth. 
This government killed the proverbial goose laying golden eggs. They heaped tax burden on businessmen. Their business operations will collapse next time due to this. Then, we will not have people to pay taxes. 

Q There is a controversy surrounding a multi-million donation made by a Chinese company to a foundation headed by your spouse Pushpa Rajapaksa. A copy of the cash cheque that transpired in this transaction has come to light now. How do you respond to the charges
Actually, it is now a matter being taken up in a court of law. We have received legal instructions not to comment on it further. It will be dealt with legally by our lawyers through the proper channel. As a result, I will not respond to it .

Users can now download all of the data that Facebook has access to, by simply choosing the general settings tab from their profiles. Facebook has taken extensive measures to ensure that privacy settings and tools are as accessible as possible, here is an overview of these measures:

1. New privacy shortcut: Gone are the days of navigating different menu options to find your privacy settings. This quick and easy to find shortcut menu, enables users to access controls over their data in just a few clicks. The features also provides a thorough overview with clearer explanations on how the privacy controls on the platform work.

2. Controls that are easier to find and use: The entire settings menu has been redesigned taking the requirements and visual presentations on mobile devices into account. The menu now drops down from top to bottom, making key buttons much easier to find. Instead of having the settings spread across 20 different screens  they can now be accessed from a single place.

3. Tools to find download and delete your Facebook data: Facebook recently introduced the Access Your Information tab- a secure way for people to quickly and easily access their information such as posts, reactions, comments and things that they have searched for. You can go to this tab and delete anything from your timeline or profile that you no longer want appearing on Facebook.

4. Two-factor authentication: The social media site recently improved its two-factor authentication process, to add another layer of protection over all accounts. The ways in which this authentication can be enabled have been expanded, to cover even users without a phone number. Previously, Facebook required for you to submit your phone number, to receive a six-digit code via text message that would grant access to your account. Now when you sign up for two-factor authentication, Facebook will walk you through the entire process, offering you a text message or app option such as Google Authenticator or Duo Mobile, to generate login codes.

5. Turn access off for unused apps: If you havent used an app within a span of three months, Facebook now turns off the apps ability to access your information. This ensures that personal details arent left exposed for long periods of time.

6. Restrict Facebook login data: With its new login system, Facebook has reduced the data that an app can request from you without a preliminary review, to include only your name, profile photo and email address.

7. Search and account recovery: Previously people could enter another persons phone number or email address into a Facebook search to help find them. This feature has now been disabled and Facebook is making changes to account recovery protocols to reduce the risk of malicious individuals scraping public profile information through search and account recovery.

8. Call and text history: Call and history, used to be part of an opt-in feature for people using Messenger or Facebook Lite on Android. The company however has reviewed this feature and has now reconfirmed that Facebook does not collect the content of any messages and will delete all logs older than one year altogether.

9. Rewarding people who identify vulnerabilities and notifying those affected by misuse: Ever committed to constantly improving its privacy protocols and measures, Facebooks Data Abuse Bounty has been set up to rewards people who report any misuse of data by app developers, or those who identify substantial vulnerabilities in the system. This in turn also motivates users to report any violations and is ensuring that app developers are held accountable for protecting peoples privacy online. Facebook is now also making an ongoing effort to inform people who may have been affected by apps that have misused their data, to ensure that they are aware and able to collectively act on violations and negligence.

10. Clear history: This new feature once introduced to the platform, will enable you to see the website and apps that send out your information. You can then choose whether you want to delete this information from your account or turn off the apps ability to store it. This is a new feature that is still under development and will be activated in the near future.

Being more aware of Facebooks new and improved privacy tools and protocols will ensure that you have the knowledge required to keep your personal details and information protected, and out of the wrong hands.

Oman Air resumes its service to the Maldives this October
	
Oman Air, the national carrier of the Sultanate of Oman, will resume its service between Muscat and Mal in the Maldives this October. Flights to the Maldives with Oman Air will recommence for the 2018-19 winter season from 28 October 2018. The service will be operated by the new Boeing 737 aircraft.
Oman Air flights from Muscat to Maldives will operate on Sunday, Monday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday and Saturday and the flight from Maldives to Muscat will operate on Sunday, Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday.
The Maldives is a beautiful chain of 26 ring atolls, made up of more than 1,000 coral islands, located only three and a half hours away from Oman. Well known for its beaches, blue lagoons and extensive reefs, the Maldives is an incredibly popular tourist destination with an increasing number of international visitors arriving year on year.
Eng. Abdulaziz Al Raisi, CEO of Oman Air said: We are delighted to be resuming our Maldives route and look forward to welcoming our valued Oman Air guests on board our latest Boeing 737 aircraft. We thoroughly encourage our friends from Europe and the rest of our network, flying to the Maldives to stop over and explore Oman en route. Our new Maldives service offers holidaymakers the perfect opportunity to explore Muscat, the metropolitan capital of Oman before escaping to the beautiful shores of the Maldives.
Oman Airs fleet and network has continued to grow. This expansion has been aided by continued investment in Oman Airs award winning on-board experience, exemplified by the MAX aircraft. The new MAX will be equipped with 12 new Business Class seats with large 17 inch touch screen monitors and all the amenities needed for a frequent flyer such as individual power and USB points. By the end of 2018 Oman Air will have taken delivery of five new MAX aircraft and three 787-9s. By 2022, Oman Airs total fleet size is expected to be around 70.
The relaunch of the Maldives service comes at an exciting time, as Oman Air recently started their flights to Istanbul in June with operations scheduled to Casablanca in July and Moscow in October. Oman Air continues to be recognised for its award winning on board experience; winning an array of industry awards to add to its growing collection.
