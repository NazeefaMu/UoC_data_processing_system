Adopt new Constitution for more economic benefits: Keshap
	
Outgoing US Ambassador Atul Keshap at a meeting with TNA leader R. Sampanthan today highlighted that Sri Lanka will be able to attract more investors and will have more economic benefits if it adopts a new Constitution, the TNA said in a media release.
Mr Sampanthan appreciated the role played by the Ambassador and his team and the US state department in the past with regard to Sri Lanka and appealed that the same level of engagement should continue with all parties in the future, it said.
Ambassador Keshap paying a courtesy call also said that the Government was yet to accomplish most of its commitments to the International community. The positive image that the Government of Sri Lanka has in the international stage should not be taken for granted, the statement said quoting the US envoy.
Mr. Sampanthan said the expectations of the international community in the best interest of the people of Sri Lanka has not been fulfilled by the Government of Sri Lanka.
Highlighting the commitments made by the Sri Lankan Government in the co-sponsored resolution adopted at the United Nations Human Rights Council in 2015, Mr Sampanthan said the Office of the Missing Persons was established after a long delay, the Reparations Bill is not yet passed, there had been no steps taken to address Accountability issues, the Commission on Truth Justice Reconciliation and non-Recurrence has not been constituted, the Constitutional process took a positive start but there seem to be delays in taking it forward.
Given the fact that there had been plenty of work done around the framing of a new Constitution for over 25 years, I dont see any justifiable reasons for delays in this. Our primary interest is in the best interest of the country, and everyone in this country will benefit from a new Constitution said Mr Sampanthan. Mustering a two-thirds Majority in Parliament need not be that difficult to adopt a new Constitution said Mr Sampanthan.
The vast majority of the Tamil People who live all over the country including the North and the East want a solution within a united, undivided Sri Lanka, there are sections of people not substantial but vocal who adopt a hardline view, but the only way to silence them and keep them away from negatively influencing the community is to deliver on the promises, said Mr. Sampanthan. We have been absolutely reasonable in our demands said Mr Sampanthan. If the Government does not deliver, the Tamil people are not going to be second-class citizens in this country.
The Ambassador pointed out that as far as the United States is concerned that the UNHRC Resolution remains operative and it is fundamental for several bilateral relationships. Further, he said the objectives of the country should remain positive in order to achieve peace and reconciliation. The positive image that the Government of Sri Lanka has in the international stage should not be taken for granted. He also highlighted that Sri Lanka will be able to attract more investors and will have more economic benefits if it adopts a new Constitution. Further, he said the United States of America will remain fully engaged with the progress made by the Sri Lankan government in the future. He also thanked Mr Sampanthan for his support during his tenure as the Ambassador.
Along with Mr Sampanthan TNA Spokesman and the Jaffna District parliamentarian M.A. Sumanthiran was also present at the meeting while the Ambassador was accompanied by Deputy Chief of Mission Robert Hilton and Joanna Pritchett, the Political Officer.

CHEC denies NYT report, pledges cooperation with SL on CID investigation
	
Denying the New York Times report that it funded the election campaign of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, China Harbour Engineering Company said today it would cooperate with any investigation by the Sri Lankan authorities in this regard.
Addressing a press conference, Joint Managing Director An Xin said the speculation by an international media organization that the CHEC funded former Presidents 2015 Presidential Election campaign was completely inconsistent with the facts.
She said the construction of the Hambantota Port by CHEC was an important national task based on mutual agreement between Sri Lanka and China Governments, and was implemented under a transparent model.
CHEC has never been involved in the internal affairs of Sri Lanka. The Hambantota Port was built for the Sri Lankan Government and its people. We wish to jointly safeguard Sri Lankas investor friendly environment. The relevant media report has distorted the facts and provided a false opinion, she said.
She said her company would fully cooperate with the Sri Lankan authorities three years ago.
We will give any kind of cooperation to the Sri Lankan authorities in any kind of investigation according to the law, she said. (Kelum Bandara)

China never pressurised us to handover H'tota port: PM
	
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe today refuted claims made by the recent New York Times story that the present government was under heavy pressure from China to handover the Hambantota Port to them after it was struggling to settle the debts borrowed during the previous regime.
Mr Wickremesinghe refuted claims made by the New York Times report during a special statement he made in Parliament this morning.
I must say that the Chinese government never pressurised Sri Lanka on this matter. What the Chinese government wanted us to do was to get proposals from Chinese companies to come up with proposals to run the Port initially. The proposal from China Merchant Port was most beneficial for Sri Lanka. China Merchant Port agreed to invest USD1,080 million on the port. Chinese President and the government as a whole was agreeable for this proposal. Accordingly,the Chinese Company and the Sri Lanka Ports Authority entered into an agreement following the cabinet approval. China Merchant paid USD293 million on December 2017 and USD97 million in January 2018. The company has paid the remaining USD589 million as of today. This is a victory as far as the people in this country are concerned. Rajapaksa government borrowed funds and constructed a port without ships. Our government had been able to settle the debts and to convert the port into a profit making one. It has not been sold out. What we did was to set up a joint venture to run the Port. Hambantota would be a developed port in the future, the Prime Minister said while highlighting that the Sri Lankan government never struggled to settle what it owed to China.
Primer Wickremesinghe also refuted the suggestion made in the New York Times story that the transfer of Hambantota Port had given China the control of territory just a few hundred miles off the shores of a rival India and strategic foothold along a critical and military waterway.
The Port will not be used for any military activity and that a clause to this effect is included in the agreement with China Merchant Port. We have highlighted this fact during the discussion with the Chinese government. Previous government borrowed Rs.1,320 million for the Port project from China. The port became an issue during the 2015 presidential elections. Repayment became an issue as the government at that time had no means to settle the debt. It was running at a loss. The losses suffered by the Hambantota Port from 2011 to date is Rs.47 billion. The Yahapalana government pledged to resolve the issue during 2015 elections. The present government had two options with regard to the Port when it came to power. First is to declare the borrowing agreement illegal and abolish it. Second option is to have a dialogue with the Chinese Government. We chose to have a dialogue with China. Present government went into a dialogue. We discussed on how to make use of the Port which was a whiteelephant at that time. President discussed with China initially and then I discussed it together with a group of ministers. Our government was of the opinion that the Port should be run as a public private partnership and to convert it into a profit making venture, he added.
There is an airport in Mattalawithout airplanes just like the Hambantoa Port which has no ships. This was a result of thedebt created by the Rajapaksa regime. We discussed about the Mattala Airport with the Chinese government but did not get a positive response. Therefore we got into a dialogue with the Indian government. Sri Lankan government will be relieved from the burden ofMattala Airport soon. It will also become a profit making venture in the future, he also said.
Further the Prime Minister urged former President Mahinda Rajapaksa to make statement and respond to the allegations made by New York Times.
I have responded to what the New York Times report has said about the present regime and I would like to request the former President to make a statement in Parliament as well, he said. (Yohan Perera and Ajith Siriwardana)

## Title: Chinese financing to MR:  Govt should  down play
## Section: Opinion

Chinese financing to MR:  Govt should  down play
	
The recent story by New York Times that China Harbour Engineering Company financed the 2015 election campaign of ex-president Mahinda Rajapaksa has caused ripples in politics. That they are only ripples and not tidal waves may imply a degree of political maturity of the government, unseen when it came to power in 2015 and suspended most of Chinese funded projects. That the government has so far reined in its ranks from pouncing upon MR and more importantly China, the largest bilateral lender, is also a somewhat departure from the usual Sri Lankan politics where no stone is un-turned to sling mud at the opponent. 
According to the New York Times story by its South Asian correspondent Maria Abi-Habib, at least $7.6 million was dispensed from China Harbours account at Standard Chartered Bank to affiliates of MRs campaign, according to a document, seen by The Times, from an active internal government investigation. Abi-Habib alleges that the Chinese loans and inducements effectively created a debt trap and led Sri Lanka to handover the Hambantota port to Beijing on a 99-year lease.
Both MR and the Chinese embassy in Colombo have denied the allegation.
This story does not tell much, other than trying to substantiate the old story of growing Chinese tentacles in Sri Lanka, or for that matter in much of the developing world, via insidious means of predatory loans disguised as development assistance given to autocrats. 
$ 7.6 mn dispensed from China Harbour A/c at SCB to affiliates of MRs campaign
	Abi-Habib alleges the Chinese loans, inducements created debt trap and led SL to handover Htota port to Beijing on a 99-year lease
	MR and Chinese embassy in Colombo denied the allegation
	Chinas economic presence, will sooner or later seek to influence domestic politics

That is however a subjective call with subjective geopolitical connotations. In fact, empirical studies of Chinese financing and those of other international lenders such as World Bank, Asian Development Bank and other regional institutions reveal that their main borrowers are the same countries. For instance, data compiled by Deborah Brautingam and Jyhjong Hwang revealed, three out of top five recipients of Chinese and Word Bank development aid to Africa during 2000-2014 were the same. Same applies in South Asia, where countries such as Bangladesh, which is heavily tilting towards China for infrastructure loans, still have more outstanding loans to Japan than to China. Same has been true for Pakistan until the influx of CPEC loans and Sri Lanka until the loss of access to concessionary loans due to its elevation to the lower middle income status. Other studies have revealed that the long term benefits of Chinas infrastructure loans and those by multilateral lenders in Africa were largely similar. 
However, Abi-Habibs story is important for one reason. She cites an active internal government investigation, which allegedly details the disbursement of financing from China Harbors accountat Standard Chartered Bank to affiliates of MRs campaign. Now if such a document exists, the government has a responsibility to reveal it. If it believes doing so would strain relations with China, which it probably will, leaking it to New York Times was not also the most sensible option. My hunch of this document is that its substance is no different from the earlier claims of billions of dollars of stolen funds that the government said it has found in the bank accounts in Dubai. Yes, there may be documents, but, as the past has proved those are an assortment of numbers concocted by a figment of imagination. They are nonetheless good enough to assail your political opponent, and take a swipe at MR as he is plotting to make a political comeback .
But, such gambles however have their own foreign policy cost as we know from the previous experience of the politically motivated suspension of development projects, and their immediate and still felt residual effect on the countrys economy.
This narrative of implied sinister implication of Chinas power has concocted a new terminology: sharp power, which are mechanizations adopted by authoritarian states to manipulate and intimidate political and social institutions by preying on the very democratic structures of these societies. Unlike soft power, i.e. the ability of states to affect others by attraction and persuasion rather than the hard power of coercion and payment, sharp power is a sinister form of power that, according to those at National Endowment for Democracy who coined the term, pierces, penetrates, or perforates the political and information environments in the targeted countries.
However, rather than the power sources that are being used-or even their intended objectives- it is the internal characteristics of the states that set apart sharp power from soft power. So when China allegedly bribes politicians, that is sharp power, when India does the same, that is perhaps , discursive power, when George Soros does it, it is something else.
And then it lumps together, all potential civilian and non-coercive sources of power resources of these supposed authoritarian states into sharp power. 
Effectively, Russia orchestrated fake news that swung elections, Chinese students in Australia, Chinese companies in the West, and probably Chinese scholarships given to government officials, all could well be termed as potential vehicles of sharp power.
Of course, internal characteristics of states can influence their foreign policy as democratic peace theorists- those who claim democracies do not fight wars against each other, partly because their leaders are restrained by their societies and that they also have other means to resolve problems - have argued. 
However, sometimes, these broadsided narratives are also part of a strategy of de-legitimization of a rising power, and they fit the template of off- cited description of revisionist power that could be destabilizing for its neighbours and the world.
We are indeed living in the same world. However, given our social economic conditions, we do have priorities different from those of Australians or Americans. Countries should conduct their foreign policy to advance, first and foremost, their self- interest. That would mean, in navigating those real and imagined claims of Chinese mechanizations, Sri Lanka has to assess the larger implications on overall national interest. 
We also need to be realistic. Given the scale of Chinas economic presence, it will sooner or later seek to influence the domestic politics. On the other hand, Chinas regime friendly relations with whoever in power also exposes it to the ire of the opposition parties.
China is not the only country to vie for influence, others too do so through their own agencies, defence attaches and other influence peddling vehicles. There again, the problem here is the murky election financing in Sri Lanka, which needs to be regulated.
However, mingling foreign policy with cut- throat domestic politics is a dangerous gamble.
This is good time to take a swipe at the Rajapaksas, but that could come at the expense of Sri Lankas ties with China, and by extension, our long term national imperatives. The government should desist its back-benchers from opening a can of worms.

Contribution to NYT expose: Mangala condemns attacks on two SL journos
	
Prompt action needs to be taken over the recent attacks on two Sri Lankan journalists who contributed to the New York Times report on massive financial misappropriation linked to the former regime, Minister of Finance and Mass Media Mangala Samaraweera said in a press release.
As Media Minister I vehemently condemn such practices where journalists are attacked for doing their job. There must be an immediate halt to these practices. These allegations must be immediately investigated by the relevant authorities and action taken against perpetrators without fear or favour," he said.
"I am also disturbed about the virulent personal attacks by individuals linked to the joint opposition and the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) in a bid to intimidate journalists who worked on the NYT report, attacking them for doing their job, the minister said.
The SLPP leadership must take full responsibility for these attacks and ensure that there is no repetition of this behaviour, he added.

Endemic birds of Sri Lanka Wildlife & Nature Protection Society public lecture for July At the BMICH
	
Sri Lanka has a high density of endemic birds  34 as presently recognised. This is as a result of island bio-geographic factors, including isolation, which makes Sri Lanka of special interest not only to local ornithologists and birdwatchers, but draws those from overseas as well. With such interest comes the pursuit of even more knowledge
Where are they found
How should one try to see them
What is lumping and splitting
Why do the number of endemics keep changing
How do scientists determine if a bird is endemic or not
What is special about the behaviour of Sri Lankas endemic birds
and many more!
Who better to give answer to these questions than Gehan de Silva Wijeyeratne In the words of British TV wildlife personality Bill Oddie,
no single individual has done so much to brand a country for its wildlife as Gehan has done with Sri Lanka.
The Wildlife & Nature Protection Society (WNPS) is happy to announce that Gehan de Silva Wijeyeratne will be presenting the July instalment of its monthly Lecture Series on July 19th, 2018 at the Jasmine Hall, BMICH starting at 6.00 pm.

Wijeyeratne has had published over 15 books and 360 articles.

Making public awareness is not intimidation: MR
	
While referring to the New York Times allegation regarding threats to journalists, former President Mahinda Rajapaksas media unit today said informing the public about the contribution of government owned Sunday Observer Chief Editor to the said report, was not a case of intimidating anybody but a mere revelation of materials facts.
The media unit in a statement said following Mr. Rajapaksas response last Sunday to the New York Times article of 25 June 2018 on the Chinese acquisition of the Hambantota port, it published yet another article last Tuesday where they accused parliamentarians associated with the Joint Opposition of intimidating the two Sri Lankan journalists who had helped them to produce the article of 25 June.
It said the original article making the allegation that China Harbour Co had contributed a large sum of money to President Rajapaksas 2015 presidential election campaign and that this money had been used among other things, to buy campaign T-shirts and mementoes first appeared three years ago in the government owned Daily News of 22 July 2015.
The New York Times by their own admission was helped by the Chief Editor of the government owned Sunday Observer to write their article of 25 June. Informing the public about this at a press conference is not a case of intimidating anybody  this is a case of revealing a material fact which will help the people understand what is going on, it said.
The NYT has not published the rejoinder to their article of 25 June sent last Saturday by Joint Opposition parliamentarian Namal Rajapaksa who represents the Hambantota district. All they have done in terms of giving us a right of reply is to post a link to President Rajapaksas response as inconspicuously as possible in their latest article.,
What we learn from this is that a newspaper that is ideologically aligned to the Obama-Clinton liberal camp and is not fair even to the incumbent President of the United States, cannot be expected to be fair towards the former President of Sri Lanka.
In last Tuesdays article, the NYT has said that it was from a government news release issued in 2010 that they obtained the information that the feasibility studies on the Hambantota port had been negative.
In this era, nobody should base a serious allegation on a mere internet post. If the NYT had asked the former Central Bank Governor Ajith Nivard Cabraal whom they had interviewed, he could have enlightened them about the feasibility studies done by SNC Lavalin of Canada and Ramboll of Denmark.
As for the money that is supposed to have been given for President Rajapaksas 2015 presidential election campaign by China Harbour Co, the present government did not suspend the activities of all Chinese Construction companies in Sri Lanka to check on their engineering credentials or their project experience.
The only matter investigated was whether these companies had any improper dealings with members of the Rajapaksa government. China Harbour Co was cleared of any wrongdoing and all their projects including the flagship Colombo Port City project, were restored to them.
In last Tuesdays article, the NYT has once again said that the present government of Sri Lanka handed over the Hambantota port to China because they were unable to repay the loan taken to build it. The reason why the NYT clings so doggedly to this idea despite President Rajapaksas explanation last Sunday, is probably to explain away the embarrassing fact that the Hambantota port was given to China by the very government that the Obama administration had spent hundreds of millions of Dollars to bring into power - as admitted by former US Secretary of State John Kerry in 2016.

NTC to launch new Google Maps facility
	
The National Transport Commission (NTC) would launch a Google Map facility to facilitate day-to-day public transportation by the year end, NTC Chairman M. A. P. Hemachandra said.
Speaking to the media at an awareness programme of entering transport data to the Google Maps App, he said the facility would be available on Google Maps and would be an additional facility to assist the general public during transportation.
He pointed out that while the Google navigation app is already available to the public, as Google did not possess local public transport data the feature does not work on the app at present. He said that the data would be uploaded and the feature activated by the end of this year.
With the use of this facility people can find the shortest and best route to their destinations while using public or private transportation. The updated Google Map app would be downloadable on all smartphones at the end the year, he said.
The facility would contain information on Inter-Provincial bus routes, railway lines, Western Province bus routes, Southern Province Transport Authority routes etc.
Meanwhile, Senior Lecturer of the Transportation Engineering Division G. L. Dimantha de Silva said the new facility would be a boost for those who commute daily who are unfamiliar with local roads and routes and would help them reach their destinations on time. As for the information, we will provide the best transport methods, bus operating timetables, bus route numbers and bus fares.
The information was made available by government websites, NTC, Railways Department, Sri Lanka Transport Board (SLTB), he said. The Google Map presently shows the distance between two destinations and duration to complete a journey. However, no details appear in the public transport tab in the application.
After implementing the facility, the public would be able to find the best way to reach their destination by the use of the public or private transport, he said. (Chaturanga Samarawickrama)

Parliamentary democracy or dictators: the choice is yours
	
With the Untied States yesterday celebrating or possibly commemorating the 241st anniversary of its independence at a time when the dangerously unpredictable President Donald Trump appears to show a liking for dictators in countries such as Russia, China and Turkey, the United Nations last Saturday marked the International Day of Parliamentarism. Mr. Trump elected mainly by a white voter base and known to be advised mainly by right-wing extremist Steve Miller, on Monday again attacked the traditional allies in the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO). He demanded they should contribute at least two per cent of their GDP to the NATO budget though he may not pull out of the alliance just as he pulled the US out of the Paris Climate Change Accord and the Iran deal. Soon after he took office on January 20, 2017, Mr. Trump pulled the US out of the Trans-Pacific agreement and in recent days has criticised the World Trade Orgnisation (WTO) which the US itself helped to create. 
After the NATO Summit later this month Mr. Trump will have a one-to-one meeting in Helsinki with Russian leader Vladimir Putin whom he has praised though the US intelligence agencies and the Senates intelligence committee said on Monday there was substantial evidence that Mr. Putins Russia meddled with the November 2016 US election and helped Mr. Trump to win. Mr. Trump has also expressed a liking for Chinas possibly lifetime leader Xi Jinping though the persistently inconsistent US President is also having a trade war with China. Mr. Trump, a billionaire businessman known to have a desire to win every deal has also expressed admiration for Turkeys President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and also the North Korean leader Kim Jong-un whom he met in Singapore last month and later described the dictator as a strong and responsible leader who is loved by his people. Most analysts believe Mr. Trumps tweets and declarations may be based on his dislike of the checks and balances in parliamentary democracy and how these prevent him from doing whatever he wants to do. 
The analysts say that though he may like to be a lifetime President there is no way he could do it because the US Constitution -- known to be one of the most enlightened documents produced by the human beings -- prevents him from going beyond the two four-year terms. 
Abraham Lincoln, known and admired as one of the greatest US Presidents, has declared that democracy is the government of the people, for the people and by the people. So there is no way Mr. Trump can change this democracy where there are checks and balances among the executive, the legislature, the judiciary and the free media -- the four pillars of democracy. 
According to a UN statement, this is the first time the world body is celebrating the International Day of Parliamentarism. It is the 1889 date on which the Inter-Parliamentary Union  the global organization of parliaments  was established. This Day celebrates parliaments and the ways in which parliamentary systems of government improve the day-to-day lives of people the world over. It is also an opportunity for parliaments to take stock, identify challenges and ways to address them effectively. 
In Sri Lanka we saw to a large extent the restoration of parliamentary democracy in 2015 with the 19th Amendment substantially reducing the powers of the Executive President. But almost three years after the August 2015 Parliamentary election what we see today is an unstable situation if not a muddle with MPs going here, there and sometimes nowhere. 
If we could have MPs who have the inner gift of honesty and integrity and the spirit of serving the people sincerely, sacrificially and selflessly then only would we have real parliamentary democracy with a just, fair and all inclusive society. There is a long long way to go, but for the sake of the country and the people especially the next generation, we hope we could do so though unfortunately a religious leader recently suggested even a Hitler-type dictator to run the country.

3 phones, 5 SIMs in Aloysius cell
	
Additional Solicitor General Yasantha Kodagoda today during his submission revealed that the Special group of Prison Department officers has found three mobile phones and five sim cards from the remand cell of Arjun Aloysius and Kasun Palisena in the Colombo Remand Prison.
He said initially the prosecution had received information that Aloysius and Palisena are allegedly communicating with outsiders using mobile phones and based on that the Prison Department conducted a search on June 29, 2018 around 2 pm at the 'H' ward of the remand prison.
The Officials found one mobile phone kept between the pillows of Arjun Aloysius, said ASG Kodagoda.
However, President's Counsel Anil Silva who appeared on behalf of Aloysius denied the allegation and said those findings did not belong to his client nor he had used them to communicate with outsiders as there were 30 other remand prisoners in the cell.
Acceding the prosecution's request the Magistrate permitted the CID to obtain details relating to the Sim cards and the imei numbers of the mobile phones.
ASG Kodagoda also pointed out that these findings could lead to more revelations while it could also amount to an offence fell under Prison Ordinance. (Shehan Chamika Silva)

## Title: Poser for the self-righteous: Will yahapalanists  back a Tamil  or A Muslim  presidential candidate
## Section: Opinion

Poser for the self-righteous: Will yahapalanists  back a Tamil  or A Muslim  presidential candidate
	
Yahapalanists, i.e. those advocating yahapalanaya or good governance, as per their own articulation of the term, are for equality, justice, truth, transparency, accountability and other such lovely things. Again, as per their rhetoric, they abhor injustice, corruption, nepotism, graft, misuse of state resources and abuse of authority, among other things. 
Yahapalanaya, in the way the term has been used by its advocates, is not just about good governance. Yahapalanist rhetoric has waved many other flags, with noble objectives beautifully embroidered on them. They have called for a separation of religion and state, regularly rant and rave against assertion of identity (usually limited to those by Sinhalese and Buddhists) and insist that Sri Lanka is a multi-ethnic and multi-religious country (carefully omitting relevant numbers and percentages). As such we have to take yahapalanaya as a political concept that embraces all these things and it is the broader definition that we use here. 
Yahapanlanists, in the sense the term is used here, refers to all those in the United National Party (UNP), the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) and other parties who directly or indirectly backed Maithripala Sirisenas presidential campaign and all individuals and organizations opposed to the previous regime.
All right. Various key yahapalana spokespersons have often dismissed and vilified their political rivals, in particular key personalities in the joint opposition and the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) as well as those in organizations claiming to represent Sinhalese and Buddhists. They have been called racists and chauvinists. They are said to be out of touch with the times, accused of living in the past and being obstacles to progress. 
Now both the parties led by the President and Prime Minister, the SLFP and UNP respectively, have a long history of positions taken than yahapalanists would not hesitate to call chauvinistic, racist, extremist and intolerant
This is not a defence of those accused thus. The ululation notwithstanding, there is truth in some of these charges at least with respect to some of those charged. The issue here, however, is about the integrity of the accusers, or put another way, the yahapalanist worthy of the yahapalanists. In short, the question is, do/can they put their money where their mouths are
Now both the parties led by the President and Prime Minister, the SLFP and UNP respectively, have a long history of positions taken than yahapalanists would not hesitate to call chauvinistic, racist, extremist, intolerant, etc. These parties have spawned many leaders who have in their operations turned the basic premises of yahapalanaya on their proverbial heads and kicked them in their proverbial behinds to boot. Furthermore, it is not as though the current lot are squeaky clean when it comes to upholding the yahapalana articles of faith. Let us be generous, however. 
Let us assume, for arguments sake, that the yahapalanists are actually abiding by yahapalana principles. Assuming thus, among all litmus tests one can theoretically conduct to ascertain integrity with respect to the noble objectives articulated by them in the run up to the January 2015 election there is one that I believe would demonstrate beyond a shadow of doubt their commitment to the yahapalana cause: the ideal profile of a yahapalana presidential candidate 
If, as they claim, the JO, SLPP and other non-yahapalanist political groups are majoritarian cannot they, the yahapalanists, being the righteous, noble and exemplary political actors on the Sri Lankan stage, be the members of political parties or not, argue for a presidential candidate who is the antithesis of whoever a JO/SLPP-led coalition puts forward (i.e., a racist in the eyes of yahapalanists)
No, it would not be enough for such a candidate to be a Sinhalese or a Buddhist uttering yahapalana terminology at every turn. They should go the whole hog. Get a non-Buddhist who is also a non-Sinhalese as the candidate. If they dont, it could mean that they are playing ethnic-politics that is a far cry from yahapalana ideals. 
Lets take Ranil Wickremesinghe. His religious affiliations are not clear, but theres no doubt that he is a Sinhalese. Sajith Premadasa is a Sinhala Buddhist. Ravi Karunanayake is a Christian, but hes a Sinhalese. Sinhalese are out, so lets not labour the point with other potential UNP candidates. Among those who are neither Sinhalese nor Buddhists, the most senior is Kabir Hashim. How about Kabir as the UNPs next presidential candidate Has any yahapalanists stopped to even consider him 
It doesnt have to be someone from the UNP, after all that party has not fielded a candidate at a presidential election since 2005. The UNP can find someone from outside the party system (e.g. Sarath Fonseka in 2010) or back a candidate from another party (e.g. Maithripala Sirisena in 2015). And the UNP need not worry if the political history of the particular candidate being embarrassing either due to wrongdoing (e.g. Fonseka, who was called all kinds of names by UNP stalwarts) or association (e.g. Sirisena). What counts is agreement on a program, never mind ability to deliver or lack of political will (e.g. Sirisena).
I am sure there are exemplary Tamils and Muslims untainted by political affiliation and endowed with the kind of integrity and aloofness from the dust and grind of ideological/political engagement. Can the yahapalanists come up with some names Better yet, will they sweat and toil for such a person to be nominated as a candidate who runs against the racists 
Lets assume that they want someone who is already political (considering the utter failure of the Fonseka experiment); lets lower the bar. Lets just say ok to any Tamil or Muslim politician, regardless of his/her track-record ideological or political. 
R. Sampanthan is the most senior politician in todays Parliament, along with John Amaratunga, the latter not relevant since hes a Sinhalese. Sampanthan had his black marks thanks to circumstances forcing his party to be an LTTE mouthpiece and before that for subscribing to Appapillai Amirthalingams chauvinism, such blemishes can be ignored. Hes not disgraced himself as the Leader of the Opposition. Moreover on countless occasions Sampanthan has spoken for all citizens and not just the Tamils. 
Age is not on his side, obviously, for hes 85. How about M.A. Sumanthiran, then The occasional Tamil nationalistic rhetoric aside, Sumanthiran has also, like Sampanthan, spoken for all citizens, articulating their concerns and critiquing policies that could have a detrimental impact on them. How about a Sirisena-like deal, where Sumanthiran is nominated as the Yahapalana Candidate with all yahapalanists backing him Would the main yahapalana party go along Thats the UNP, by the way, which added a yahapalana tag to the party name when contesting as a coalition in August 2015. How about Rauff Hakeem Hes been embraced by the UNP and the SLFP at different times. Arumugam Thondaman 
Would all this shock the yahapalanists Would they say Im being mischievous and just trying to tease yapalanists to find someone who is unlikely to win Well, the fact of the matter is, either you are idealistic or else you are abusing idealism. You cant be a yahapalanists who is willing to bend the yahapalana yardstick, surely 
Lets hear it from them. Dear yahapalanists, would you go with a candidate whose choice will do justice to your multi-ethnic, multi-religious rhetoric or would you not

A 15-month-old boy in Karnataka, India, died after he accidentally swallowed a pressure whistle, Malaysia Nanban reported.
The boy was at home with his grandmother, who was cooking dinner. She left the pressure cooker open and he crawled near the lid, pulled off the whistle and swallowed it.
After failing to pull it out, the grandmother took the boy to a clinic where the whistle was removed, but he developed breathing difficulties.
The family then rushed him to a hospital, but he died on the way. (The Star Online)

Reflections on some wonderful friends
	
My friend Hiruna, who is studying for his A Levels, yet somehow finds the time to write the most beautiful Sinhala poetry I have ever read from someone his age, is something of a rarity. Not because he writes poetry (dont we all, at some point) but because his preferred cultural icons are so far removed from the Sanukas and the Santhushes of this era that he has become virtually isolated. He has written essays and essays on everything from the era he panders to - the sixties, seventies, and eighties - ranging from Hansa Vilak to T. M. Jayaratne to Amaradeva to Sekara. Because of my inability to read between the lines when it comes to poetry, sivpada or nisadas, I have come to appreciate the critic in him rather acutely. He has read much more on the subjects he tends to - especially on music and the movies - than anyone his age.
And yet, he is not alone. There are others. Perhaps not as into what he likes as he is, but nevertheless with a sensibility which has been honed to past objets dart that the young today are rubbishing day in and out. Its hard to tell whether this is a miniscule minority or whether it has the potential to grow up and mature. In that sense theres a lot to be expected from the families and friends of these youngsters, because with the correct guidance, they can and will become the wielders of the arts tomorrow.
Schools have rarely produced artists the way they produce and are structured to produce engineers, lawyers, doctors, and accountants
The most common excuse dished out by those who are fascinated by the icons of the present is that the past is dead, live with it! Its a flimsy excuse, though one Ive come across from youngster after youngster wherever I go and am. Perhaps its to do with how the media has suppressed the old in the programs they broadcast. Either way, an entire generation is growing up not even having heard of the usual icons - Amaradeva, Victor Ratnayake, even Clarence - and this despite the fact that these names are hardly ones we can pass over. Someone once said somewhere (I cant remember the name or the time, though it was way, way back, a long time ago) that if Sri Lanka chose to send something that demarcated ape kama to the moon, it would send the songs of Amaradeva. Laudable, but consider that we have children, and students at that who are studying in GOVERNMENT schools, who have not even heard of his name, much less his songs. So yes, people like Hiruna are rather rare.
There are reasons. For one thing, schools have rarely produced artists the way they produce and are structured to produce engineers, lawyers, doctors, and accountants. Parents have set notions about what they want their children to become and this impedes on the ability of individual societies to do with the arts to nurture up and coming artists. If you are studying science for your A Levels, chances are that no matter how suitable for chairing and leading literary, drama, and debating societies you may be, you will be compelled to exit them abruptly to concentrate on passing that Z score and entering university. And this isnt resolved by handing these societies over to those who study arts. As Ayath, whom I interviewed last year over how Sinhala drama is taught and sustained at schools in and around Colombo, argued, there is a discrepancy between those who take to the arts and those who debate, do drama, or write poetry for competitions. More often than not, its those other streams - Science and Commerce - which produce the bulk of the members who want to do something. More often than not, also, those who choose arts opt for it because they have nothing else to offer. They just arent interested was what Ayath told me.
Thats one reason. Not the only reason. Its easy to go on lambasting structures and institutions. Looking inward, at the fault in ourselves, however, is much, much more difficult. The truth is that many of us from this generation and generations after us are rabidly averse to the past, or anything that is too old to be venerated in hagiographic terms. When Amaradeva passed away, for instance, there were howls of protest over one particular young vocalist who contended that there were much better voices than the maestros among his (the vocalists) colleagues. Whether or not this was true (such judgments, subjective though they are, can be assessed), the timing of the statement was hardly apt. And yet, this is but just one part of a broader phenomenon. Young people I talk to take to the guitar and the microphone as though God has willed it. The richness of technology, in other words, is drowning the richness of imagination, and imagination, a key prerequisite to the production of art, is lacking among them. Sure, they know how to please the ear. Its just that they dont know how to please the mind.
Poetry, the most potent and literary of all cultural forms (the novel and the short story, by comparison, are newer, more recent), is a veritable yardstick when it comes to other cultural spheres, in particular music. The young dont have the time to read, and even if they do, they just arent interested was what Ajantha Ranasinghe told me during our interview. He has a point. As a people, we arent reading enough. Literacy rates, premised as they are on the ability to read and write on a rudimentary level, are hardly adequate by way of assessing whether we should be reading and writing more.
How can the culture of a country thrive if its poetry languishes As Garett Field notes in his book Modernising Composition: Sinhala Song, Poetry, and Politics in 20th Century Sri Lanka, the cultural revival we saw in the preceding century was supported by a plethora of lyricists who were able to preserve the literariness of their work while contributing to the countrys musical sphere. It was for this reason, Field observes, that Chandrarathna Manawasinghe was able to come up with a new poetic meter for his masterpiece, Wali Thala Athare, and that his student Mahagama Sekara contended in a 1966 lecture that a test of a good song was to take away the music and see whether the lyric could stand on its own as a piece of literature. (This quirk, which we are used to in Sri Lanka, confounds Field so much that he admits the inadequacies of Western ethnomusicology when it comes to the Sinhala lyric.)
Ultimately, in a country and a region which has historically privileged the fusion of words and rhythms (regardless of how sophisticated or not our ancestors were, they were able to musicalise what they read in ways which baffle scholars today), the first step towards the flourishing of a cultural sphere is the dissemination of our poetry, and lyrics, among our students. This is not an easy task, but we must engage in. After all, were talking about generation after generation who grow up indifferent to history (which, during the social studies experiment of the Sirimavo Bandaranaike regime and even the dates-driven approach of the curriculum prior to it, was taught rather well). Were talking about an entire generation neglecting the need for the lyric, in favour of technology. The allure of the guitar and the boy band is too strong to be overcome. If ever they venerate the bands of the past - the Moonstones, the Super Golden Chimes, right down to the Gypsies and Marians and the Jayasri Brothers - we forget that these groups, superficially appealing to juvenile, adolescent tastes, nevertheless had members who did not neglect the lyric. Such a generation, growing up in indifference and ignorance, can only be salvaged by our generation.
The cultural revival we saw in the preceding century was supported by a plethora of lyricists
And it doesnt end with poetry, by the way. We all write poetry, especially Sinhala and Tamil poetry, when we are young. Its when we grow up that our tastes part ways and compel us to follow one path at the cost of all other paths. Its the same story when it comes to other cultural spheres, be it drama or literature or painting. Many teenagers I talk to who like drama, tend to be interested in the movies. Until you consider that the film industry in Sri Lanka has almost always depended on the theatre for its reserves of not only actors, but also scriptwriters. (If ever there was an actor here, a proper one, who did not hail from the theatre, I am yet to hear of him or her.) until you consider that acting today has been confined to models and dilettantes who lack the seriousness, the controlled grace, of the actors I admire: from the very recent past, Uddika Premaratne, Saranga Disasekara, and the newest face of them all, Thumindu Dodantanne.
Hiruna isnt alone, as I mentioned before. There are others. Many others. All of whom profess an interest in various other spheres, the movies included, with an interest in being active participants in those spheres. Hiruna, by nature introspective, prefers the path of the poet. Those others prefer the path of the director, the scriptwriter, and the discerning actor. To be all these things, it is necessary to be a discerning human being. Are our institutions, of learning and power, enough to channel their innate sensibilities and respond positively to what they want to become I certainly hope so. Until that transpires, though, I can only hope and continue being friends and talking with them.

Vijayakala  overshadows NY Times revelation
	
No sooner had the political debate generated by the New York Times article regarding campaign financing of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa died down than State Minister of Child Affairs Vijayakala Maheswaran threw a bombshell in Jaffna on Monday, that took the South by storm. 
At a function to mark Janadipathi Nila Mehewara on Monday, State Minister Maheswaran, widow of former MP T. Maheswaran who was gunned down in Colombo a few years ago, remarked that the LTTE should be revived as a means to create an atmosphere in the North for people to live without fear. 
As a politician representing the UNP in Jaffna, it is hardly unlikely that she will make any extra gain from her inflammatory remarks either

The State Minister, the only member elected to Parliament on the ticket of the United National Party (UNP) representing the Jaffna district, made such remarks ostensibly after being emotional over the recent killing of a schoolgirl in Manippai, Jaffna. The event was attended by two Cabinet Ministers - Vajira Abeywardane and Tilak Marapana. Alongside, Northern Province Chief Minister C.V. Wigneswaran and TNA MP M. A. Sumanthiran were also present on the occasion. 
It is quite common for Tamil politicians in the North and the East to eulogize the LTTE in their bid to woo Tamil voters. Some TNA parliamentarians such as S. Sritharan and M.K. Sivajilingam are notorious for such inflammatory speeches. Let alone, their behaviour yields in terms of political benefits for them in the northern and eastern constituencies primarily shaped by Tamil nationalist sentiments. 
Be that as it may, it is a different case for State Minister Vijayakala Maheswaran who represents a national party like the UNP in Jaffna.
The LTTE was a terrorist outfit that fought an unsuccessful war for 30 years till its decimation at the hands of the security forces on May 19, 2009 in a narrow strip of land called Mullivaikkal. There was so much bloodletting because of the war that ravaged the country. It still remains a banned outfit not only in Sri Lanka but also in countries such as the United States, India and European Union.
Anything, characteristic of the LTTE, is scornful in the South. So, for that matter, State Minister Maheswarans clarion call for the organizations revival left her party in the lurch in politics. All hell broke loose after the media gave wide publicity to her speech. Politically speaking, the UNP was so inconvenienced that its own MPs rushed to demand action against her in Parliament. 
Anything, characteristic of the LTTE, is scornful in the South. So, for that matter, State Minister Maheswarans clarion call for the organizations revival left her party in the lurch in politics. All hell broke loose after the media gave wide publicity to her speech
It is UNP MP S.M. Marikkar who raised the issue in Parliament first. The UNP MPs intention could be two-pronged in this instance. One could be the mitigation of political damage to the government in general and to the party in particular over the speech. The other one could be an attempt to prevent the opposition led by former Mahinda Rajapaksa from making any political gain by taking the government to task labelling it with the LTTE tag. 
It happened at a time when the government or the UNP for that matter was harping on the MRs camp over the revelations made in the New York Times article alleging that MRs. election campaign in 2015 was financed by China Harbour Engineering Corporation. It generated a heated political debate in the country with responses and counter-responses on the matter being featured prominently in the mainstream media. But, the debate was subdued somewhat by State Minister Maheswarans speech.
In fact, the UNP back-benchers even started questioning in jovial sense whether she had received some financial inducements from MR to make such a speech distracting public attention from the contentious issue being debated in political circles. 
Nonetheless, her speech, according to many in politics, is politically immature since it has ramifications for her party. Also, as a politician representing the UNP in Jaffna, it is hardly unlikely that she will make any extra gain from her inflammatory remarks either. 
16-membergroup finally merged with JO
The group of Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) MPs, who joined the opposition, was finally absorbed into the Joint Opposition led by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa. For the first time, these MPs participated in the parliamentary group meeting of the Joint Opposition chaired by MR on Monday evening. 
MP Lakshman Yapa Abyewardane had one particular request to be made in this instance. He asked the Joint Opposition not to call his group the 16 member team any longer. The former President also agreed to work with these MPs as one entity here after. Now, the political party-led by MR is a 70-member group. The group, altogether, decided to renew its call for the opposition leader post in Parliament. 
In fact, this SLFP group merged with the Joint Opposition under political compulsion only. The initial thinking, they had when defecting from the government, was different. They believed the SLFP was relegated to a dismal third position at the local government election because the party aligned with the UNP in forming the unity government. As such, the anti-UNP vote base was grabbed en bloc by Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) as per their calculation. 
So, they tried to join the opposition and carve out their niche. In fact, they undertook a series of public meetings aimed at this. Yet, it proved to be a failure. The group found it extremely difficult to maintain a distinct identity independent of the Joint Opposition. So to speak, the circumstances led them to merge with the Joint Opposition rather than being a separate group. 
Like DMK in Tamil Nadu, Wiggy to form TMK in North
It is now apparent that the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) is heading for a split ahead of the elections to the northern provincial council this year. Earlier, Northern Province Chief Minister C.V. Wigneswaran said he would be compelled to look at an alternative to contest the elections unless he was given nomination by the TNA. It is all clear now that the TNA will not consider him for the next time. There was certainty in this respect after TNA MP M.A. Sumanthiran spelled out clearly that the nomination of Wigneswaran to the Chief Ministerial post last time was a failed project. 
Against the backdrop, political sources from the north said that Mr. Wigneswaran had decided to form a new party named Tamil Makkal Koottani (TMK). He is reported to have chosen that name purposefully so that the abbreviation TMK rhymes well with Tamil Nadu political partyDMK (Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam). If the party is formed, we will have TMK in the North and DMK in Tamil Nadu of India.
Also, TNA MP Mavai Senathirajah also harbours ambition to contest for the CM post this time. If he is fielded, the election is slated to be hotly contested in the north, a departure from single party domination enjoyed by the TNA on previous occasions. 
All in all, the revelation by the New York Times and State Minister Maheswarans speech occupied the centre-stage of news coverage last week, distracting public attention from other burning issues.

We are ready to help police fight the underworld - Ruwan Wijewardene
	

I think many people in the North have forgotten that the LTTE started the war by killing their own people

We have to invest in more equipment and vessels to secure the territories

Certain opposition elements are trying to create fear in the people saying that national security is under threat

Right now the Police and the STF are doing a good job

We would be able to curb the underworld menace soon


The increasing rate of crimes and incidents related to contract killings and shootings has made people question the status of national security from time to time. Nine years into the post-war era, Sri Lanka still has several issues to solve in order to bear the fruits of the reconciliation process. While the North is being recovered, the South needs to be watched closely. In a recent statement, State Minister of Defence Ruwan Wijewardene said that the military will be involved to curb underworld activities. 
In a candid interview with theDailymirror , the Minister reiterated on the current status of national security in the country, the need to develop maritime surveillance and the importance of the reconciliation process. 
Excerpts :

Should people worry about the state of national security in the country as at present
I dont think people have to be worried when it comes to national security. I know that certain opposition elements are trying to create fear in the people saying that national security is under threat and that the LTTE is coming back. But none of these allegations is true. We do have certain issues when it comes to law and order even in the North, but to say that the LTTE is emerging again is absolutely false and I think by saying that they are also disrespecting the forces and the Police and all the effort put into bringing peace into the country. The emergence of the underworld for example is an issue regarding law and order and now the Special Task Force has been handed the task to curb underworld activities with the CID and CCD getting involved. But the President also instructed that the tri-forces should also get involved. So we are ready to provide assistance to the Police if they need it to fight the underworld. But if the Police feel that they cannot cope up with the pressure they have to request the support of the tri- forces. Right now the Police and the STF are doing a good job, but on the intelligence aspect all three services are working in tandem. Therefore I think we would be able to curb the underworld menace soon. 

Weapons belonging to the LTTE were recovered from the North on several occasions and certain factions including ex-Army personnel have mentioned that the Government is trying to conceal the actual situation when it comes to crimes. What are your comments regarding this statement
Since the conclusion of the war there have been people who have got caught with explosives, weapons and other items. These incidents continue to happen. People who got caught in the Oddusudan incident for example were arrested and now we are in the process of interrogating to unearth for what purposes they were trying to use the weapons. But there are also a lot of underworld activities in the North. Even the tri-forces are involved in investigating into this issue. There are pockets of people who want to create issues in the North, but there is absolutely no threat to national security. 

Against this backdrop State Minister of Child Affairs Vijayakala Maheswaran pointed out the need to revive the LTTE. What are your thoughts regarding this statement
I totally disagree with what she has said. She should remember what happened to the people in the North. Her husband too was assassinated by the LTTE. So for her to come up with a statement like that cannot be condoned. I think many people in the North have forgotten that the LTTE started the war by killing their own people. There were so many moderate Tamil politicians who were assassinated by the LTTE. Therefore, for her to make such a statement is totally out of character and its not the view of the UNP nor the Government. 

 Are there legal barriers for the Army that prevents them from resolving matters related to underworld and other crimes
The military is involved in strengthening national security when it comes to war and terrorism. But underworld activities are seen as a law and order issue and these issues are dealt with by the Police. During an event when the Police feel that they cant cope with the pressure they would ask for assistance from the forces. Until then we cannot get involved. When it comes to law and order the Police have been trained and it is they who know how to handle a situation like that. But if it goes out of hand then the military will get involved. But right now the STF is handling these issues and they are doing a good job. 

How secure are the Sri Lankan waters today 
Our waters are somewhat secure. But we should now concentrate more on building up on our Navy. Now that the war is over we thought that we should develop in terms of maritime surveillance. We need to focus on the Navy and the Air Force. There are instances such as illegal fishing and drug smuggling via sea routes. Therefore the Navy is patrolling those areas and they have caught quite a few people who have been trying to smuggle in drugs. But they use various methods to bring in narcotics into the country. The sea territory we possess is huge to the extent that we border with Australia as well. That whole area is unmanned and we dont have the equipment to do the necessary surveillance in the area. Most of the ships we have are offshore patrol vessels which usually cannot go far into the deep sea. We also have to build our Air Force in order to engage in maritime surveillance. Once we have the necessary equipment it would bring our sea territory under more control and enhance its safety. 

Do we have a threat from sea pirates
Not in our area. But our main concerns have been narcotics, human smuggling and illegal fishing. One of the main trade lines runs through the southern part of the country where 60-70% of the trade between the East and the West takes place. Therefore its absolutely imperative that we secure those areas. So we have to invest in more equipment and vessels to secure the territories. 

With the establishment of the Colombo Port City project and the Hambantota Port will there be regulations on Chinese vessels such as submarines entering our territories
Chinese, Indian or American submarines could enter our waters, but they need to first obtain permission from us. But whether there are submarines within the territory is a question mark. 

Most of the high-rise buildings in the country stretch to as many floors as possible. Are there adequate regulations to secure the air space
There are regulations manned by the Civil Aviation Authority and closely linked with the Air Force as well. During the war these regulations were monitored by the Air Force, but now there is always a conflict because civil aviation companies want to operate in Sri Lanka. However because of air space restrictions they have issues. When it comes to the high-rise buildings there are necessary safety precautions they need to abide by. But the biggest issue that we have been speaking on is that in case of a fire, if there is an emergency, how could we go about dowsing that fire and securing the lives of the people who are affected That is a big concern for us. We are waiting for the Air Force to present us with some proposals regarding this issue. 

What is the next step in the national security plan 
We are still giving priority to the reconciliation process and there are a few issues that we need to iron out regarding the North and the East. This is one reason why most of these issues relating to law and order are emerging.
There is a large amount of unemployed youth, who are getting foreign currency from their relatives abroad. So they dont feel the need to have jobs because they already have the money and they spend their money on buying motorcycles and watching movies from Tamil Nadu, which is where they are getting all the ideas from.
Those issues have to be targeted and solved. When an area that was once a battle ground is freed these kinds of issues emerge. Therefore it will take time for these issues to be settled and our job is to make sure that these issues dont get out of hand. Once the reconciliation process takes place, these matters will be controlled. We are also controlling our sea, doing the necessary maritime surveillance and strengthening security. As for the country I dont see any huge national threat.

Weve already decided on action against Vijayakala: PM
	
The Government had already decided on the action that was to be taken against State Minister Vijeyakala Maheswaran, who had called for the resurgence of LTTE, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe told Parliament yesterday.
The belief of the Government is that LTTE, which is an organization that is banned internationally, should not re-emerge and that the national issue should be resolved with the consent of all ethnic groups.
If someone in the Government had spoken contrary to this, action should be taken. We have therefore decided on the action that has to be taken against Mrs Maheswaran, the Prime Minister said.
I have contracted Mrs Maheswaran and had told her to meet me while Speaker Karu Jayasuriya had asked the Attorney General to take action against her, he added.
The Prime Minister also said the Speaker should take action against those MPs who disrupted Parliament sessions unnecessarily on Tuesday.
He said himself and the Speaker had already decided to take action against Mrs Maheswaran by the time the Opposition MPs staged the protest in the House.
Those who created a commotion on Tuesday are the very persons who gave Ministerial posts to LTTE terrorists. They are the ones who have money to the LTTE to win elections, he also said.
Also, he charged that the Joint Opposition is making the Vijeyakalastatement a big issue just to cover up the report by the New York Times. (Yohan Perera and Ajith Siriwardana)
