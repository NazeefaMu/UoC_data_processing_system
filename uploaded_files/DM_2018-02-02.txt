Allow experts to offer a healing touch
	

Arthritis is a general term used to describe inflammation of the joints.
Osteoarthritis and Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) are two disease types which are known to affect musculoskeletal system in several ways. Their prevalence in the modern society is quite high, but with timely interventions, the negative impact on the quality of life can be eliminated.
Since both these conditions own numerous similar signs and symptoms, they are often used interchangeably by people. So, from this article we are going to discuss what osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis mean, their features, diagnosis and treatment, so that next time when a person you know is diagnosed with either of these diseases you will understand what it is exactly.
What is Osteoarthritis
Also known as Arthrosis, osteoarthritis is a degenerative type of disorder which is known to be the commonest form of arthritis seen in the community. 
It occurs as a result of wearing off of the protective cartilage at the end of joints over a period of time. This cartilage acts as a friction absorbing cushion and the absence of it can lead to a continuous friction generated on rubbing the bones with one another, ultimately ending up with a worn out joint.
Even though this condition can damage any joint in the body, the most commonly affected joints include hands, knees, hips and spine.
Advanced age, obesity, trauma to the joints, genetics, bone deformities (malformed/defective cartilage), long-term weight bearing and heavy weight lifters are more likely to get affected by osteoarthritis where females are at a higher risk than males in developing this condition. More often this affects people over 40 years of age, but it can also be seen in youngsters following accidents and trauma.

Patients with osteoarthritis usually present with Pain around the affected joints, difficulty in moving them due to stiffness and pain and stiffness which is aggravated more towards the morning just after waking up. This condition usually lasts for more than 30 minutes. In addition these people will also complain of loss of flexibility, limited range of movements, loss of muscle bulk, a grating sensation on moving joints and spurs which present as hard bony like structures over the skin around the affected joints.
Complications-Osteoarthritis should be diagnosed as early as possible failing which it can lead to a lifelong debilitating condition where the patients will no longer be able to work. 
Your physician will ask for a complete history and do a thorough physical examination, looking for signs of inflammation such as pain, tenderness, swelling, redness and difficulty in moving before coming to a general diagnosis. However, this will further be confirmed by an X ray (worn off bones, absent cartilages and spurs could be seen) with or without an MRI. Furthermore, blood tests (ESR) and joint fluid analysis can also be important in order to exclude other mimicking conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis and gout respectively.
Even though, there is no complete cure for osteoarthritis, lifestyle modifications and pharmacological interventions are known to be able to address the condition in the aspect of symptoms.

Lifestyle modifications- Regular exercises, maintaining a healthy Body mass index, avoid stress on joints which is caused by heavy weight lifting etc. and change of occupation if necessary etc. 
	Medication
1. Pain relief- Acetaminophen can be used for mild-moderate pain, but long term usage can lead to liver damage.
2. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) - Ibuprofen, Naproxen sodium
3. Anti-depressants such as Duloxetine- to treat chronic pain

Physiotherapy
	Occupational therapy
	Surgical interventions-Corticosteroid injection to relieve severe pain and inflammation
1. Hyaluronic lubrication injections
2. Re-aligning bones
3. Joint replacement surgery or Arthroplasty- Removal of damaged joint surfaces and replacing them with metal or plastic parts.
What is Rheumatoid arthritis
Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic auto immune condition which is characterized by pain, tenderness, swelling and stiffness in the affected joints including hands, feet and wrists, in a symmetrical manner. This can also result in extra articular manifestations involving skin, eyes, lungs, blood and nerves.
Even though the exact etiology for rheumatoid arthritis is not clear, it is an autoimmune condition where the body produces antibodies against its own cells. Some scientists suggest that micro-organisms such as virus and bacteria play a major role in pathophysiology where smoking is thought to be another.
Accounting for a significant female predominance, Rheumatoid Arthritis usually affects young people around the age of 20.
The majority of the patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis present with an acute onset of joint pain, tenderness, swelling and limping in joints all over the body which will gradually progress as the weeks pass. Other extra articular symptoms can include fever, loss of appetite and weight, generalized body aches, red eyes, rheumatoid nodules over skin, anemia etc. Patients can also present with joint pains aggravated in the morning. This condition usually improve within 30 minutes in contrast to osteoarthritis pain.
Physicians are able to diagnose this condition by analyzing the signs and symptoms derived from a complete history along with information about the family background. This can be further confirmed using imaging studies such as X RAY and MRI along with blood tests such as Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP) and cyclic citrulline antibody test (anti-CCP).
The treatment plan for Rheumatoid arthritis mainly includes lifestyle modifications and pharmacological interventions.

Life style modifications- Regular exercises when the inflammation is controlled and appropriate rest during severe flare ups.
	Medications
1. Anti-inflammatory agents
2. Pain relievers (Narcotics)
3. Corticosteroids
4. Disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs)  Hydroxychloroquine, Immuno-suppressants such as methotrexate
Even though there is no lifelong cure for Rheumatoid Arthritis, timely interventions can definitely prevent disability.
Where does the difference lie
The major difference between these 2 conditions lies in the nature of the natural course. Even though both these conditions affect our musculoskeletal system, Osteoarthritis is a degenerative, wear and tear type disorder where RA is an autoimmune condition.

Both these conditions have a significant female predominance yet. Osteoarthritis usually affects people over 40 years of age where the incidence of RA is higher among young individuals around the age of 20.
Osteoarthritis is a result of long-term pressure on large joints such as hips, knee and elbow resulting in a wearing off where the exact etiology of RA is not very clear, suggesting the influence of a genetic predisposition and long term smoking. 
Osteoarthritis usually affect one particular area or joint in the body where RA tends to affect multiple joints all over the body.
SummarySigns and symptomsOsteoarthritis
Joint pain, tenderness and stiffness around hands, fingers and knees
	One side is worsely affected than the other
	Morning stiffness for more than 30 minutes
Rheumatoid arthritis
Multiple joint pain, stiffness and tenderness
	Symmetrical symptoms 
	Morning stiffness which improve within 30 minutes of activity
 Extra-articular manifestations such as fatigue, fever, loss of weight and malaise
Diagnosis

These two conditions can easily be diagnosed with a clear history but XRAY, MRI and blood tests can be used to confirm the diagnosis.
	Wearing off of joints, absent cartilages and spurs can be seen in an X ray of a patient with osteoarthritis.
	ESR, CPR, anti-CCP may be elevated in RA where there will be no change in Osteoarthritis.
Treatment
Pain relief, symptomatic management and prevention from further destruction are the main targets of management.
	Rheumatoid arthritis specifically has to be treated with immune-suppressants.
	Both Osteoarthritis and RA have no long term cure but with timely interventions complications can be halted.

Arrogance of a political appointee
	

This fair one ensconced by a powerful political hand in the main chair of a department collecting revenue for the government recently tongue-lashed a clerk in such abusive language unbecoming of a high-up of her position, employees say.

This white collar high-up had got furious when she found a Rs.250 allowance which she thought was due to her but had not been added to her monthly salary. Concerned, she had immediately sent for the pay clerk and demanded why he failed to add the allowance to her monthly pay.

Have you no brain Dont work like a donkey! Do you know that my husband is a Ministry secretary she had asked.
The pay clerk had explained that according to the relevant Treasury circular, only Ministry secretaries were entitled to this allowance.
What the hell do you know about Treasury circulars the high-up had barked at the clerk. Ill chase you out like a dog. Now get out!

Attacks on  female candidates A LANDMARK ACHIEVEMENT TURNS SOUR
	

Over the past weeks female candidates have been subjected to attacks ranging from verbal abuse, psychological abuse to physical violence. The Centre for Monitoring Election Violence(CMEV) has received 34 complaints regarding violence against females during elections. In total 421 complaints have been received regarding election violence. However, activists point out that the number could be more as incidents are not reported due to fear of further reprisal. Sources have pointed fingers at the inefficiency of the police in investigating into these complaints and curbing violence.
According to the Suriya Womens Development Centre two female candidates contesting from the Manmunai Pattu Pradeshiya Sabha (Batticaloa) have been subjected to character assassination using social media. One has been threatened and stones have been thrown at her residence and windows have been smashed as well. The husband of another female candidate from the Vavunathivu ward has verbally abused her and threatened her though she had discussed with him beforehand about contesting. In a recent press release the Womens Action Network (WAN), which is a network of 8 women organizations operating in the North and East, listed out that a woman candidate in the Monaragala District, who was involved in election campaigning, was admitted to the hospital in a serious condition after she was brutally attacked. Another female candidate from the Puthukkudiyiruppu area of the Mullaitivu District was physically assaulted, kept locked in a house, and threatened to withdraw the complaint she made to the Police, the statement said.


Unsupportive males

Female candidates also complained of how males were not supportive. One female candidate told us how she is coerced to provide men with alcohol, so that she could receive their support. WAN in its statement noted of how female candidates in Puttalam and other districts have been verbally humiliated by religious leaders and have been subjected to revolting comments. Further candidates and activists pointed out that female candidates were often told that they would not or could not win at the elections. The Dailymirroralso learned that certain male candidates dissuade the public from voting for women.

An amendment to the Local Authorities Act has made it mandatory for political parties and independent groups to include 25 percent of female candidates in their nomination papers. Though this amendment is praiseworthy, with candidates being dissuaded from campaigning, subjected to gender based violence and other forms of harassment and injustice, activists are skeptical of the outcome.

In the light of recent events theDailymirrorspoke to activists, female candidates, the Center for Monitoring Election Violence (CMEV) and the Elections Commission to assess the nature and extent of the violence and injustice faced by female candidates.

Commission doesnt have power to arrest culprits
-Mahinda Deshapriya
Elections Commissioner Mahinda Deshapriya said that the commission doesnt have the power to arrest culprits or initiate legal proceedings against them. There is a separate unit at the police to investigate such matters. We have informed the police of several incidents. If the house of a candidate has been stoned, for instance, the police should inquire. We too send a team and collect data, said Deshapriya.

Complaints can also be made to the Elections Commission via ecsl2018@gmail.com. This email account is checked every hour or half an hour, he said. Further complaints can be lodged through Tell Commission-Elections Commission of Sri Lanka.

Referring to attacks on female candidates via social media he said candidates could lodge complaints at the cybercrimes division at the police as well. However, he noted that women did not continue with proceedings due to the backlash from society.

Some candidates refused nominations
- SumikaPerera
Meanwhile the Coordinator of the Womens Resource Centre, SumikaPerera based in Kurunegala raised concern about a different aspect of injustices that women have been subjected to. Perera pointed out that some women were given nominations to contest from areas where the opposition was very strong. Women who were dedicated to their work in a particular area did not get the opportunity to contest from that area. Instead they have to contest in areas where the opposition is strong and where it is impossible to win, she said. She added that this would ultimately create a notion that despite there being a quota women are not capable of winning elections. 
Some female candidates had not been given nominations, and had to join other political parties, she said. 
A minimum of 10% women candidates is required in the first nomination list. Perera highlighted that in all wards women were nominated only up to 10%. They were nominated just to fulfill the requirement and no woman was nominated in addition to this. 
She also noted that groups monitoring violence should take note of psychological violence too, caused by sexist remarks and discouraging sentiments that they are unfit to enter into politics. 
One candidate came to me sobbing that she had been asked to put up ten banners and distribute leaflets as the leader of the party was visiting. I asked her to tell outright that she did not have the money, she said.
Our voices need to be heard
- Nalini Ratnarajah 
Political Activist, Nalini Ratnarajah said that mostly women candidates were subjected to character assassination. This morally, emotionally and psychologically affects them. Women are supposed to be good women, home makers looking after the family. When women face sexist comments, when people threaten them that their child or husband will be abducted, that photographs and videos against them will be released on social media they are asked to stay at home. 
A candidate who is in her second marriage has been subjected to gossip that she was having an illicit affair with some other man. The husband was supportive at the beginning. But when he started receiving anonymous calls about his wife, though he trusted her, the woman was asked to stop her campaign, she said. 
She stressed that the government should introduce laws to address such violence. Women are the backbone of the Sri Lankan economy. The government runs the local authorities, provincial councils, and even the Parliament with the foreign revenue earned by women. Half of the population is women. So our voices need to be heard, she said.

Police hesitated to take action against men

The National Coordinator of the Centre for Monitoring Election Violence (CMEV), Manjula Gajanayake said that under the new electoral system female candidates should be encouraged to win or otherwise the party would be at a disadvantage. But unfortunately male candidates perceive this as a threat. 
He further pointed out that in certain local areas male candidates were powerful and therefore the police hesitated to take action against them when they have attacked female candidates. Apart from the incidents of explicit violence Gajanayake highlighted how women have been either deceived or dissuaded especially during the nomination period. Party organizers have made promises that certain women will be nominated but their names have not been added to the nomination list. Most women did not know that they should sign nomination papers under the additional list. Until the deadline of handing over nomination papers some female candidates were not informed whether they would be included or not. If they knew before that they will not be nominated, they could have approached other political parties. So the party organizers were able to successfully and strategically prevent them contesting from other parties, he said.  Further, two unsuspecting women from Mawanella in Kegalle have discovered to their dismay that their names were included in the list of candidates without their knowledge. In Kandy another woman had received an invitation from the police station for an awareness workshop conducted by the police. Upon inquiry from the police she has found out that she had been invited because she is contesting. 
When a complaint is lodged at the CMEV the incidents are documented and referred to the election commission and the police for action. The alleged culprits are contacted simultaneously. Further, field coordinators are sent to inquire.

They think that we dont know politics

A female candidate said that she had to provide alcohol to her male supporters. After a meeting or campaigning I have to provide the supporters with alcohol which costs at least Rs. 10 000. Otherwise no man would turn up to go canvassing the next day. They think that we dont know politics because we dont display our credentials. Now I go canvassing with two other women, she said.
Gender based violence is normalized
- Shreen Abdul Saroor

Human Rights Activist Shreen Abdul Saroor of the Womens Action Network (WAN) said that though affirmative action has been taken in the form of a quota to boost female representation, proactive action to make sure female candidates did not undergo violence has not been thought of. 
She also referred to an incident in Batticaloa involving a male candidate running a bar who invited neighbourhood men, which included family members of one candidate, for free drinks.The male candidate has spoken about the appearance of this woman candidate including her lipstick and how she goes around with men. At the end the husband beat her up. The uncle scolded her. This would have never happened to a man, Saroor said.

How can this female candidate go and complain of this as election violence Will the police accept it as election violence This is domestic violence as it is her husband who has beaten her up. So this is how a male candidate who saw a strong candidacy in this woman tried to weaken her by making sure that she had trouble at home, she pointed out. 
She further said that gender based violence was normalized in Sri Lanka so much so that women can be beaten up and accused of being loose women. She added that the root cause was that there was impunity and immunity to perpetrators of gender based violence.

Women going around campaigning are called loose women. The Moulavis are using the Friday prayers, the regular sermons to say that the women who are contesting are unislamic, and are breaching the Quran etc. Families of some female candidates have asked them to stay back at home and not campaign as a result. How can they win Saroor quizzed.
 
The police should arrest at least one person for a day, so that the news is disseminated via the press that a person who attacked a female candidate was arrested. This can work as a deterrent, she said.  None of the leaders of the political parties have spoken about the plight of these women candidates, she said.
She pointed out that political parties, particularly minority parties, were unprepared and that they included women for the sake of fulfilling the mandatory requirement

She further said the election commission, the male dominant political parties, and the law and order structures were not geared to look at how difficult it was for women to enter into politics.
Women educated on how to handle violence
-Prof. S. Rathnajeevan H. Hoole
A member of the Election Commission, Prof. S. Rathnajeevan H. Hoole said that the EC conducts seminars, and informational sessions to women on how to handle such violence.
 
Referring to the video clips by two Muslim clerics attacking female candidates he said the video has been handed over to the police. I gave the video and a week later I was told that they were waiting for it to be transcribed and then to be translated into Sinhalese. He pointed out that a Tamil police officer could have looked into it instead.

Referring to the female candidates house which was searched by the police for weapons he said the police searched the house at night without a female constable. He pointed out that the police can trace the phone number and arrest the person who made the false complaint. However, this has not taken place.
Angered by Moulavis comments
Speaking to the Daily Mirror Bisliya Butto, currently the Puttalam District womens wing coordinator of the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress (SLMC) and a contestant in the forthcoming election said thatat some religious sermons clerics have imposed aprohibition on women contesting. Moulavis have said that Muslim women who contest are not proper Muslims. They have also said that women cannot get up on stage and speak in public. This affected us psychologically
She further said that they would take action against such religious leaders who openly dissuaded them from contesting. She added that plans were underway to draw up a petition against the moulavis and obtain the signatures of about 125 persons.
 
Meanwhile she said the police searched another candidates house forweapons based on a false complaint. She claimed that this was because thecandidate was a female.

Posters circulated on Facebook
Another candidate contesting from Arayampathy, Kulanthavadivel Jeyachandrika, said that she has been subjected to character assassination. A photograph taken at an opening ceremony of a road development project where an MP was standing next to her while she was cutting the ribbon has been edited and circulated around. Posters made out of the edited photographs have initially been posted on the walls of her house and later on her close relatives. Thereafter the posters were found in public places such as markets and bus stops, she said.

These posters were also circulated on facebook. They try to portray me as a loose woman, that I am unfit to be in the community and that I should be thrown out, she said. Further her house has been stoned and the roof has been damaged.

She had made a complaint at the Kattankudy Police Station on December 06 and had thereafter requested for police protection. To date no protection has been provided.

Callous bid to exploit her distress
	

This ladys younger brother had gone missing about one year ago leaving no trace. Police had assured her from time to time that they were investigating the disappearance pursuing whatever lead they happened to stumble on.

However, recently on hearing that the Police had suddenly dropped their investigations, the lady decided to air her grievance to a deputy purohita representing the district. She had actively campaigned for this deputy at the last general poll and expected him to help her in the matter.
When the lady called at the deputys political office, the politico was away and she explained the purpose of her visit to the deputys private secretary.
Akka, we all are now busy campaigning for our candidates. And we are about to go canvassing. Why dont you join us as you have done before We can look for your malli once this election is over! The private secretarys callous disregard for the purpose of her visit had got her goat and berated him in choice Sinhala, they say.

## Title: CID files B Report over bond scam, cites Mahendran, Aloysius
## Section: Breaking News

CID files B Report over bond scam, cites Mahendran, Aloysius
	
Filing the first B report in Court on its investigation into the CB bond scam, the CID on Friday cited former Central Bank Governor Arjuna Mahendran, Perpetual Treasuries Ltd., (PTL) owner Arjun Aloysius, PTL Chief Executive Officer Kasun Palisena and PTL as suspects in the main magisterial inquiry.
Appearing for the CID, Senior Additional Solicitor General Yasantha Kodagoda PC told Court that the facts presented in the report were based on the prima facie appearance of the material investigated so far by the CID.
SASG Kodagoda said once the prosecution found suspects liable, in connection with the allegations, beyond reasonable doubt, the CID was legally obliged to arrest and produce the suspects in Court in due course.
CID in its report stated that Arjuna Mahendran was liable in connection with an estimated Rs.688 million financial loss caused to the Government at bond auction on February 27, 2015.
It levelled criminal charges against Arjuna Mahendran on two counts, Criminal Breach of Trust and Criminal Misappropriation by way of deliberate violation of the due process at the Central Bank and causing a huge financial loss to the Government.
Above allegations were levelled under the Section 5(1) of the Public Property Act, and Section 386/389/391 of the Penal Code.
PTL's de facto owner Arjun Aloysius was also made liable for Conspiring to commit the two offences of Criminal Breach of Trust and Criminal Misappropriation with Arjuna Mahendran at the bond auction on February 27, 2015 under Section 113(a), 386, 389 and 391 of the Penal Code and the Section 5(1) of the Public Property Act.
The CID also made Arjun Aloysius and PTL CEO Kasun Palisena liable in the bond issue under the offence of Abetment (Section 102 of the Penal Code).
Perpetual Treasuries Ltd (Arjun Aloysius and Kasun Palisena) were also made liable by the CID for engaging in illegal insider dealing by obtaining price sensitive inside information, which is deemed to be a punishable and prohibited conduct under Section 56 (1) of the Registered Stocks and Securities Ordinance and the Code of Conduct for Primary Dealers by the CBSL. (Liable to five years of imprisonment).
In the 'B' report, the CID alleged that Arjuna Mahendran had also helped PTL to get insider information and therefore made him also liable under the offence of Abetment for insider dealing.
On behalf of the CID, SASG Kodagoda PC also sought nine Court orders pertaining to the further magisterial inquiry of the CID under the Section 124 of the Criminal Procedure Code.
Acceding to all requests, Colombo Fort Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne imposed a foreign travel ban on Arjun Aloysius and directed the Immigration Department to inform the CID no sooner Arjuna Mahendran arrives in Sri Lanka. It was revealed that Mr. Mahendran, who is a Singapore citizen was currently residing in there.
SASG Kodagoda sought a court order to direct the Monetary Board not to lift its suspension order on two RTGS accounts in which PTL as a primary dealer transacted in the Primary and Secondary Markets in Government securities. Those two RTGS accounts has a balance of Rs.9.1 billion belonging to PTL.
The Fort Magistrate also ordered two PTL officials -- W. Jesudasan and Finance Manager N. Nadeeka Dilhani to hand over the initial documents pertaining to the bond transactions to the CID with no further delay.
The Magistrate also made a special order suspending PTL from the transfer, the sale, gifting, investing or transacting using its assets or funds with any party. The Magistrate made this order based on the prosecutions observation that there is a possibility of moving the PTLs assets to third parties to forestall any potential future legal confiscation.
Acceding to the CID s request to question Arjuna Mahendran over the allegations, the Fort Magistrate ordered Mahendran to report to the CID before February 15, 2018 and directed that the court order be sent via Singapore International Police to Mr. Mahendran's residence.
Court also directed PTL officials -- W. Jesudasan and Finance Manager N. Nadeeka Dilhani to provide the relevant detailed documents pertaining to every primary and secondary market bond transaction of PTL to the CID with immediate effect.
SASG Kodagoda also sought court orders to obtain a detailed list of PTLs acquisition of assets using the profits gained in bond transactions in the recent past.
SASG Kodagoda told court, People were involved in colluding not due to their generosity towards PTL, but as they had been bribed to do so.
The Fort Magistrate also directed the secretary of the Presidential Commission of Inquiry, to provide all collected materials (phones and computers) it had obtained during its inquiry and investigation to the CID for further magisterial inquiry.
A Court order was also issued to the CBSL Governor, Non Banking Financial Institutions Supervision Director and the Director of the CBSL Financial Intelligence Unit to prepare a comprehensive forensic report on the bond transactions since February 27, 2015 to date and hand it over to the CID without delay.

Curing a disease that puts your tummy on fire
	

Commonly known as Amla Pitta disease in Ayurveda, Gastritis has become a severe and a common cause of ailment. The Daily Mirror spoke to Ayurvedic Doctor D.D. A Hettiarachchi regarding Gastritis, its causes and the cures.
Pancreatic juice produced by the pancreas for digestion is called Amla in Ayurvedic terms and is highly acidic. This juice is a combination of various enzymes. The gallbladder holds the bile produced in the liver for digestion and the bile is called pitta in Ayurvedic terminology. Both these juices Amla and pitta are vital components of digestion and are being secreted into the stomach. Sometimes these juices dont help digestion, but blows up causing nausea, vomiting and pain. 
The stomach is busy during the night and upon waking up in the morning, the enzymes in the stomach are craving for food. Having a glass of water in the morning as the first thing helps mixing those enzymes in the bloodstream and the powerful enzymes, meant to digest food, gets filtered by the body and the majority of it is released out from the body as waste, without harming the body. Having a glass of water upon waking is crucial, therefore. Usually, no one has a full meal soon after waking up. Having a hearty breakfast is not that good to the stomach either. Since it is the beginning of the day, the organs, especially the stomach, need to prepare for the heavy workload ahead and therefore needs a light breakfast for the body to function better. The perception the society has on the intake of food is misguiding. This shows when people have meals fit for a king during breakfast, eat like an average person for lunch and what a beggar has for dinner. Breakfast should be light and it is not advisable to have a full meal. Lunch should be heavy while an intake of less food is advisable for dinner. If dinner is heavy, the digestion process might disturb the quality of sleep. Hard working individuals are permitted to consume heavy meals.
There are many other causes of gastritis. Human food patterns and lifestyles have contributed largely to this. Fast food, instant food - (especially the packets of noodles with artificial flavouring) and bakery products are some of the questionable foods. Instant food is flavoured with chemicals harmful to the human. Consuming them and bakery products quite often seems to be the easiest option for people who lead busy lifestyles, but over a period of time the chemicals in these food damage the physique.
Stress is also connected to gastritis because much indulgence in negativity and worry changes blood circulation patterns in the body.

Tips to follow
Have several small portions of nutritional food throughout the day.
Avoid spicy and acidic food as much as possible. Avoid having tomatoes, Pickle (achcharu) and vinegar as well as heaty fish like Herring, Skipjack Tuna, and Cuttlefish.
Have fruits like banana and homemade rice flour rotti or hoppers when you feel hungry between the meals.
Have at least a 20-minute break after lunch and the meal also should be taken without a hurry and being conscious of it. Heavy activities are not permitted soon after meals. The alcohol in the food causes a certain sleepiness and the recommended rest should be taken till this alcoholic effect fades away and makes room in the stomach. This is caused by digestion.
Avoid the consumption of heavy meat like mutton and beef.
Eat Snake gourd, Sponge gourd, and Lambkin Melon to cool your body. 
Herbal treatment
Cut a fleshy aloe vera leaf, keep a day to reduce the bitterness and cut to chunks carefully. Without chewing put the contents directly into the throat and gulp. Aloe has a miraculous power in healing wounds and soothing inflammation.
Cook Aththikka using some coconut milk and less spice and have it 4 to 5 days regularly.
Heat fresh milk with raw ginger and a few nut grass (Kalaanduru) bulbs which adds a zest to the milk. This saves the stomach from bad bacteria.

Focus on Wetland Ecosystems A natures gift which does a great balancing act Celebrating World Wetla
	
World Wetlands Day is celebrated annually on 2 February. The theme for 2018 World Wetlands Day is Wetlands for a sustainable Urban Future.
Wetland ecosystem is the most precious gift given to us by nature and possessed by us from the time of early civilization. Rapid urbanization, dumping waste and filling wetlands for commercial use are few of the critical issues threatening this natures gift to us. These unhealthy human activities have put this precious ecosystem in danger. Humans driven by money and power refuse to see the connection between human well-being and the ecosystems. Therefore, conservation and proper management of these valuable wetlands are essential. 
The RAMSAR Convention states, Wetlands are land areas that are saturated or flooded with water either permanently or seasonally. Inland wetlands include marshes, ponds, lakes, fens, rivers, floodplains, and swamps. Coastal wetlands include saltwater marshes, estuaries, mangroves, lagoons and even coral reef. Fish ponds, rice paddies, and salt pans are human-made wetlands. Wetlands range in size from less than a single hectare to the Pantanal in Brazil, Bolivia and Paraguay, which covers an area three times the size of Ireland. 
Peatland, a form of wetland, prevents and reduces the impact made by floods. Peatland does this by absorbing huge volumes of water. It acts like a giant sponge, absorbing water during a flood and releases water throughout the year little by little saving the human cultivation, plants as well as animals. Muthurajawela is a Peatland in Sri Lanka. Wetlands take the form of a massive interconnected net, thus damaging a single wetland will affect all the other wetlands in the network. Tanks, canals, reservoirs and ponds are also considered wetlands. Approximately 15% of land in Sri Lanka consists of natural and man-made internal wetlands. 
Colombo has a series of interconnected wetlands, referred to as Colombo Wetland Complex which includes Beddegana, Thalawathugoda (Diyasaru Park) Kimbulawela, Madiwela, Kolonnawa, Crow Island, Thalangama Tank, and Beira Lake. This wetland complex expands to an area of approximately 4700 acres. As much as 90% of the wetlands contribute to urban food supplies through the production of rice, vegetables, dairy, poultry products plus fishing and native plants. Much of these plants are used in the practice of traditional medicine. 
The Colombo wetlands play an important role in mitigating floods (with a capacity to store enough water to fill 27,000 Olympic - size swimming pools) while also helping to reduce extreme temperature across at least half of urban Colombo through evaporating and cooling. In addition, most of the wetland areas improve quality of the air by trapping and removing airborne pollutants, thus helping to reduce various cardiopulmonary and respiratory diseases. 
In some areas of the Colombo metropolitan region, as much as 60% of the wetland area has been lost since the 1980s. The current overall rate of loss through infilling and indiscriminate dumping of solid waste is estimated at 1.2% per year. Unless this trend is reversed, the wetland area will decline by 1/3 over the next two decades. 
The quality of water is considered to be poor or very poor in about 2/3 of the wetlands, primarily due to untreated domestic waste water. The situation has been critical for the past five years. This has threatened the ecological health of wetlands. This situation has been made worse by routine dredging. The drainage of wetlands has made them more susceptible to a variety of invasive plant species. 
Promoting conservation 
Sri Lanka became a member of RAMSAR Convention in 1990. According to the RAMSAR website it is an Intergovernmental treaty that provides the framework for national action and international cooperation for the conservation and wise use of wetlands and their resources,. Sri Lanka has recently nominated Colombos Wetlands to be included in the RAMSAR Conventions new programme for wetland city Accreditation. This programme aims to promote conservation and the wise use of wetlands in and around urban areas, with sustainable socio - economic benefits for the local people. The scheme encourages cities that are close to wetlands- especially those holding international importance- to increase public awareness of the value of these ecosystems in municipal planning and decision making. 
Sri Lanka has submitted an application for this through the Department of Wildlife Conservation (DWLC) IWMI says. Several community representatives who depend on the resources of the Thalangama tank clarified details relating to the history, threats faced, advantages and what should be done to protect the tank . 
The Thalangama Tank dates back to the time of King Parakramabhahu VI. Archeological evidence of an old wier has revealed that the tank was built during ancient times. This discovery was made during the construction of a new bund recently. Thalangama Tank provides water for their paddy fields, the villagers and the neighbouring community. The tank was historically known as the Thadaaga Graama at the time of Parakramabhahu the VI. And the tank was used to bathe elephants in the Kotte palace and to hold the traditional water-cutting ceremony in an adjacent Devala (Shrine). With the demolishing of the Kotte Kingdom, the tank and its importance was also forgotten. Many acres of paddy fields were neglected. Now, the major issue is water management. The floods that occurred in 1989 was due to lack of vision. Even the parliament complex was flooded. All that was a result of filling the Lake Drive sans a proper plan a representative from the community said.

In case this type of floods repeat, we should be ready with solutions
Environmental protection areas
Thalangama Tank is providing livelihood to 175 farmers, nurturing more than 200 acres of rice paddy and contributing to the urban food supply. It is home to 70 species of birds, 30 species of other animals including dragonflies, fishing cat, Purple-faced Leaf Monkey and moose deer. Covering about 35 acres, Thalangama Tank and its surrounding wetlands are Environment Protection Areas named by the Central Environment Authority (CEA) under the National Environment Act of 1980.

The President of Parakum Farmers Association said they are facing a major threat of destruction due to the ill practices of the neighbouring community of the lake. They are disposing untreated waste water into the tank. The second threat comes from the garbage dropped along the road surrounding the tank by impertinent bypassers. The villagers are always on alert since protecting the tank is critical for their livelihoods. He said the members of three farmers associations are using the water from the tank for their paddy cultivation. Outsiders come to bathe in the tank, but we dont even put our feet in the water. Once it was revealed that the water in the tank was contaminated with feces. Rich householders in the boundary of the tank are sending all theirwaste water into the tank.
Another threat
Pond Apple (Wel aththa) is posing another threat to this valuable ecosystem since this invasive plant has been growing on a large patch (eight and half acres) in the middle of the tank. This issue was later controlled. Specialists find it difficult to solve the Pond Apple issue since a number of animal species are living on these trees. Pond apple is a critical threat to all the wetland ecosystems.This tank is widely used to control flooding in the parliament area. Massive floods occurred in May and November in 2010. In case this type of floods repeat, we should be ready with solutions. Controlling floods wisely using these wetlands will reduce their impact on Colombo and suburb areas, Nadeera Ruberoe, a Wetlands Ecologist said.

We have to invest in wetland conservation
Continuing business as usual will cost water users, fisheries, the tourism industry and Government budgets almost LKR 35 billion over the next 25 years, said Lucy Emerton, an economist attached to Environment Management Group, SOAS University of London.

The Key challenge to the wetlands is shifting the process of development plans in wetlands. Wetlands actually save people a great deal of money as well as control floods. We have to invest on these wetlands. Investing on wetlands conservation adds substantial value to the urban economy and avoids costly losses and damages. Continuing business as usual will cost water users, fisheries, the tourism industry and Government budgets almost LKR 35 billion over the next 25 years. Wetlands generate economic services, facilities and amenities worth around Rs 723,000 ha/ year. The value of wetlands has been assessed for the year 2018 as follows :


Flood control- LKR 1,485 million a year Water purification- LKR 521 million a year Recreation- LKR - 16 million a year Energy supplies- LKR- 24 million a year Fisheries productivity- LKR- 80 million a year Support to agriculture- LKR- 93 million a year Total - LKR 2219
million a year
 
Flood retention, nurturing rice paddies and waste water purification are among the major services provided by wetlands to humans and the environment. We cant value the role played by wetlands to control floods.

She also mentioned that Muthurajawela is a multipurpose natural asset, which is widely useful to the production of paddy and fish. Answering a question regarding the dumping of waste into Muthurajawela, she said the waste is leeching into the water of wetland polluting surrounding ecosystems as well as the Negombo lagoon. 
People think the wetland is a smelly, dirty, unhealthy and unproductive land. What they think of is to build shopping malls and houses in lands like these. City dwellers need environments like these to unwind too. They can visit these beautiful wetlands with their children and relax. That is vital to city dwellers mental well-being, she added.

According to the IWMI, Diyasaru Park-formerly known as the Thalawathugoda wetland covering 60 acres -has been developed by the Sri Lanka Land Reclamation and Development Corporation (SLLRDC) into an urban wetland. Together with the Parliament Lake, the park has been designated as a wildlife sanctuary (Sri Jayawardenepura Sanctuary) by the DWLC under the Fauna and Flora Protection Ordinance of 1937. This park is home to more than 28 species of dargonflies, 28 species of reptiles, 7 species of mammals (including the fishing cat and otter) and more than 80 species of birds and more than 40 species of butterflies. The park serves the environment as a flood retention zone. 
International Water Management Institute (IWMI) arranged a field visit for journalists to visit the Thalawathugoda Tank and Diyasaru Park. They were accompanied by environment experts who provided them with information regarding threats, challenges and the importance of conserving wetlands.

HC extends freeze on PTL accounts by a month
	
The Colombo High Court yesterday made an order extending the freeze of all bank accounts of the Perpetual Group associated with Arjun Aloysius by one month, sources said.
Following an application made by the Attorney General on behalf of the CID, the High Court extended the order made last week by the Director of the Financial Intelligence Unit of the CBSL freezing the operations of bank accounts of all 24 companies within the Perpetual group.
Earlier, on January 24, the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) issued a directive that none of the 24 companies within the group can carry out financial business of any sort using the funds in their bank accounts.
Among the companies in the group are Perpetual Treasuries (Pvt) Ltd, Perpetual Asset Management (Pvt) Ltd, Perpetual Capital Holdings (Pvt) Ltd, W. M. Mendis & Co Ltd and Integrated Media Networks (Pvt) Ltd. (Shehan Chamika Silva)

Heads to roll in foreign missions
	
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in the process of restructuring its foreign missions and as a result several key positions in Sri Lankas vital and influential diplomatic hot spots would be changed, the Daily Mirror learns.
A senior government source said on condition of anonymity that our Head of the Mission in Geneva, Mr. Ravinath Aryasinghe would be called back to the Foreign Office (Colombo) and he would be replaced by Mr. A.L.A.Azis who was the Director General of the EU affairs, Multilateral Treaties and the Commonwealth. Mr. Aryasinghe will serve as an additional Secretary at the Foreign Ministry.
"In addition, new appointments will be made to Sri Lankas embassiies in Washington DC, UN mission in New York, Moscow, Pretoria in South Africa and Brasilia in Brazil among other appointments. All new appointments will be made soon after the LG polls, the spokesman said.
He said Mr. Sunil Silva, High Commissioner to South Africa has already been sent to Kenya as Sri Lankas new envoy there.
Sri Lankas foreign policy and restructuring of our foreign missions will be based on the policy articulated by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe in his speech delivered at the Second Indian Ocean Conference in September last year in Colombo with emphasis on the Indian Ocean rim countries.
In that speech, Mr. Wickremesinghe said Sri Lanka would continue to take a leading role in bringing her partners in the Indian Ocean together to deliberate on issues of importance to all of them.
Sadly, the Indian Ocean region including the Bay of Bengal remains low. For example, South Asia remains the least economically integrated region in the world. Unlike the European and Pacific nations, there is an absence of political will to promote Indian Ocean Economic Cooperation more specifically, trade liberalization and connectivity. Therefore, our objective is to improve on these sectors through economic diplomacy, he emphasized.
The rise of violent extremism, growing incidents of piracy in and around the Horn of Africa loom over our region. Given the rising conflicts in the Middle East and West Asia, worlds major powers have deployed substantial military forces in that part of the Indian Ocean Region. Sri Lanka would offer its fullest corporation and logistical help to keep sea piracy at bay.
The cabinet approval was granted on Tuesday (30) to a proposal made by President Maithripala Sirisena to further strengthen the surveillance by Sri Lanka in the Indian Ocean to ensure security in international sea lanes running passing Sri Lanka, he said. (Sandun A Jayasekera)

Humbuggery to cover up skullduggery
	

A political party leader recently appointed a committee purportedly to look into the possible link of any of his party members to an explosive issue that continues to rock the polity. However, this move is being disdainfully dismissed by many in political circles and the public domain as an eyewash, they say.

It has become well-known that a sibling of the purohita heading the committee was a legal advisor to the guilty ones.
Appointing this dubious committee, they say, is downright humbuggery resorted to by the leader in a nave bid to whitewash the party members
who are really involved in the scam.

NEW DELHI - An Indian designer has accused high-end fashion brand Christian Dior of copying his designs on a dress, in the latest of a string of claims by small-time designers that big fashion houses use their work without acknowledgment or permission.
Orijit Sen, who said he penned designs of a man doing yoga poses in 2000 said he was shocked when he saw an Elle India magazine cover with Bollywood starlet Sonam Kapoor wearing a printed dress that resembled his work - down to the same yoga poses and colour combination. I couldnt believe theyve copy-pasted my artwork and used it as part of an international collection, he said.

Indonesia set to make sex outside marriage illegal
	

Indinesia, (Daily Mail), 1 February 2018 - -Sex outside marriage is set to become a crime in Indonesia, following a proposal by lawmakers this week. 
If the revision to the criminal code is passed by Parliament, sexual acts involving unmarried persons and gay sex in any form would be punishable by up to five years in prison. 
Sex outside marriage is already considered a crime in Indonesias Aceh province, where strict Shariah law is implemented and those who violate it are whipped in public. 
Rights groups and legal experts fear this will set back human rights and privacy in Indonesia, and the spread of vigilantism, already common in parts of the sprawling Muslim-majority nation of more than 250 million people.
They are racing to organize opposition, and an online petition launched this week has gathered more than 20,000 signatures.

Iran arrests 29 women as headscarf protests intensify
	

TEHRAN AFP Feb2, 2018 -Tehran police have arrested 29 women for appearing in public without a headscarf as protests against the dress code in force since the Islamic revolution of 1979 intensify, Iranian media reported Friday.
Those arrested were accused of public order offences and referred to the state prosecutors office, the Fars, ILNA and Tasnim news agencies reported without elaborating.
Chief prosecutor Mohammad Jafar Montazeri had played down the escalating protests on Wednesday, saying they were trivial and childish moves possibly incited by foreigners.
He had been asked about a woman detained earlier this week for standing on a pillar box in a busy street without the mandatory headscarf.
Unprecedented images of at least 11 women protesting the same way had been widely shared on social media.
A prominent human rights lawyer told AFP on Tuesday that one of the detained women had her bail set at more than $100,000 (80,000 euros).
Montazeri said those flouting hijab rules -- which require headscarves and modest clothing -- must have been encouraged by outsiders.
But even religiously conservative Iranians have voiced support for the protests, with many saying that religious rules should be a personal choice.

Its time to clear the air!
	

When Sri Lankan cricketers walked out of a Test match in Delhi wearing pollution masks, environmentalists were quick to point out that Colombo was not far from experiencing a similar issue. True enough for some of us prone to breathing problems, a brisk walk on the street is almost impossible without developing a coughing fit or itchy eyes. Air pollution isnt always visible, but can certainly be deadly. As our exposure to emissions and poor air quality across Sri Lanka increases by the day, the quality of the air we breathe has now become a major public health concern. In a bid to enhance our understanding of air pollution and its effects, Health Capsule spoke to Consultant in Respiratory Medicine at the Provincial General Hospital and the District Chest Clinic, Badulla, Dr. Neranjan Dissanayake. 

Excerpts of the interview: QCan air pollution be defined in terms of medicine
The life of every living being depends on the ability to produce energy for its day to day functions. Most of them use oxygen at the cell level to burn substances and produce energy efficiently. Humans depend on air around us to obtain oxygen through a mechanism we call breathing. Each day an average adult breathes in and out about 10,000 litres of air. On average only about 21% of this air is oxygen. The rest is made up of many other gases and
airborne particles. 
In most instances these substances are quite harmless. But it is important to note that, whether or not a substance is harmful to the health of an individual will not only depend on the chemical and physical structure of that particular substance, but also the concentration of that substance in the atmosphere. It also depends on the time duration that an individual is exposed to that substance.Some substances, even in minute quantities,can cause significant harm while others may not. 
The effects of certain inhaled substances will also depend on the health of the person who is exposed to it. Not all individuals will feel ill in this type of atmospheric environment. 
The World Health Organization (WHO) defines air pollution as contamination of the indoor or outdoor environment by any chemical, physical or biological agent that modifies the natural characteristics of the atmosphere. Hence the presence of any gas, a particle or organism that is not usually present in the atmosphere is air pollution. 

QWhat is indoor air pollution
Its important to highlight the significance of maintaining the atmosphere of our homes, dwellings and work places sans pollution. Sometimes we inadvertently and unknowingly pollute our environments. The best examples are the use of firewood for cooking, burning mosquito coils, burning incense or by smoking indoors. 

QCan you define these harmful substances
Some substances are gases such as ozone and oxides of nitrogen. Some are organic compounds that are easily vaporised at room temperature, hence they are called volatile organic compounds (VOC)(Eg: Benzene). 
Particulate Matter or PM is one of the important groups of harmful substances that have been identified. PM is a complex mixture of extremely small particles and liquid droplets that enter the air. The diameter is usually measured in micro metres. Depending on size, not only can they reach air sacs and the distal airways of the lungs, but will penetrate and enter the lung tissue and body causing harm. 

QHow can we measure air pollution
How we measure this differs from country to country and area to area. Usually Governments and/or environmental agencies will identify certain defined substances and measure their concentrations in the atmosphere. Depending on that they will calculate an index which will be used to stratify the risks and warn the population in that specific area and during that time period. This index is usually known as the Air Quality Index. 
For example the United Kingdom uses the concentration of five substances. In Sri Lanka, the National Building Research Organisation (NBRO), conducts monitoring of air quality by measuring the concentrations of two substances, namely Sulphur dioxide (SO2) and Nitrogen Oxides(NOx). These stations are documented to be based on several districts in Sri Lanka including Colombo, Kalutara, Galle, Gampaha, Kurunegala,Kandy, Rathnapura, Anuradhapura and Badulla. 

QCan air pollution affect a persons respiration
Many substances that we breathe are first encountered by the respiratory system; hence the many detrimental effects caused. The respiratory system, in turn tries to eliminate these substances by filtering, but sometimes it is overwhelmed by the concentration as well. 
Many effects of air pollution will be felt by individuals who already have lung diseases such as asthma and chronic airway diseases (COPD). These substances will act as irritants and may trigger a response in the airways. As a result the muscles around the airways will get constricted, and there will be increased amount of secretions causing a narrowing of the airways. This will some time cause chest tightness, laboured breathing and a musical sound to emanate from the chest, which we call wheezing. The irritation will trigger a cough as well. In exceptional circumstances certain substances in given concentrations might cause extensive damage to the lung. 

QCan exposure to air pollution cause respiratory disease
Yes. There is enough evidence to suggest that air pollution not only aggravates pre-existing respiratory diseases, but causes respiratory diseases. The effects span from conception to the day we die. It has been shown that air pollution affects the growth of the foetus, especially the development of the lung. This means that this particular child, when born has an already compromised lung. This state is seen when a pregnant mother is exposed to smoke. But there are pregnant mothers exposed to second hand smoke bio mass fuel. 
It has also been proven that certain pollutants cause asthma as well and trigger severe attacks of asthma. Air pollutants are a known cause of Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease, a chronic lung disease with major consequences to patients. It also can cause diseases of the minute space between the air sac and the blood vessels of the lung, which is known as the interstitial space. This thin membranous space is very important in allowing the diffusion of oxygen from air in to the blood. Hence the alteration will impair the oxygenation process. This group of diseases are called Interstitial Lung Diseases. Especially exposure to airborne substances when involved in various occupations sans proper protection can predispose a person towards developing this chronic respiratory illness.


QWhat are the most dangerous consequences of exposure to air pollution
According to recent evidence based reports, it is estimated that 40,000 additional deaths per year can be attributed to air pollution in the United Kingdom alone. Out of this 40,000 a calculated 29,000 can be attributed to the effects of Particulate Matter. 
In Europe it is estimated that indoor air pollution contributes to about 90,000 additional deaths annually. Oxides of Nitrogen, mainly NO2, emitted by vehicles are known to cause increased deaths running into thousands.It is a proven fact that air pollution increases the risks of heart attacks and heart diseases as well. The level of pollution has been shown to be closely linked with severe exacerbations of heart and lung diseases.

There is also evidence to suggest that air pollution affects our brain activity and function, increases the risk of diabetes as well as obesity. It may increase the risk for certain cancers. Even the skin is not spared as there are studies that show skin ageing increases with air pollutants. 

QDoes air pollution cancel out the effects of exercise outdoors
Whether it cancels out the benefits is debatable. But it will definitely increase the risk of adverse effects when we exercise in a polluted environment. This should not deter individuals from exercise.

QWhat precautionary measures can adults and children take to avoid over exposure
I think the most practical aspect to control exposure to air pollution is to keep our atmosphere at both home and work as clean as possible. Its always better to avoid particle generating substances like firewood, incense, mosquito coils being burnt. It is imperative that people avoiding smoking indoors, especially in the presence of family and colleagues.

QWhat mechanisms can be implemented to improve air quality
Vehicle emitting tests that have been implemented is a positive step in this direction. I am happy that monitoring of air quality by the NBRO is gradually developing.The gravity and effects of air pollution has to be understood first. There are various studies done by some exceptional scientists looking into the Sri Lankan picture. If we can formulate a structure involving the Government and professionals involved in research and manage clinical aspects of air pollution, we can identify the Sri Lankan situation properly and implement certain mechanisms to negate the negative outcomes. Having efficient monitoring facilities with daily and if possible hourly updates on air pollution levels in a certain area will be the standard we should be reaching for. 
Monitoring vehicle emissions more closely and efficiently with stringent measures taken at the policy decision level regarding the vehicles that are imported is important. A good set of rules with sound legal backing will be needed to curtail factories polluting the air. 

QWhat is your final message to our readers
The risks of air pollution to health are real. It is not hypothetical. It has arrived at our doorstep! As a nation and as individuals, it is time that we rise up to the challenge to counteract the negative effects of air pollution.
Dr. Dissanayake is the incumbent Hon. Joint secretary of the Sri Lanka College of Pulmonologists and a member of the European Respiratory Society and the Asia Pacific Society for Respirology. He also serves as a member in the advisory board on Tuberculosis to the Ministry of Health.

Judging character by the position, length and shape of fingers
	

In some previous articles we have discussed the characteristics of the fingers. In this article, we propose to discuss more significations relating fingers based on their position, length and shape.
We, laymen, normally refer to five fingers on the hand. But for palmists there are only four fingers, because they do not count the Thumb as a finger. They honour the Thumb with separate and distinct treatment in Palmistry. One renowned palmist says: The Thumb is about the importance to the hand as the nose is to the face.
Now let us examine the position of each finger in relation to other fingers.
First Finger or Index Finger or Finger of Jupiter and its position
Leaning towards the Thumb: Subject has a great desire for independence
	Leaning towards the Second Finger: Unreasonable pride
Second Finger or Finger of Saturn and its position
Leaning towards the First Finger: Superstitious
	Leaning towards the Third Finger: More rational
Third Finger or Finger of Apollo or Sun and its position
Leaning towards the Second Finger: Morbid vanity
	Leaning towards the Fourth Finger: Practicing art for monetary

Living in a dream world
	

There is a senior politico who is quite outspoken about his hope and ambition to be the next Number Two when the yahapalanaya falls which he says is a cinch.

The politico is said to be often telling his intimates these days, Be patient for a little while. Ill be in a position soon to look after you all much better!
The aides close to the politico say that their boss is going about his work in an unusual buoyant spirit these days like one just about to achieve his goal in life.
The politico would often tell those around him that he had closely moved with a number of leaders in the country and given his seniority and experience he is the most qualified person to be the countrys Number Two.

Mahathir Mohamad or Putin instead Prince Edward: PHU
	
The Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) yesterday said the government should have invited former Malaysian Prime Minister Dr. Mahathir Mohamed or Russian President Vladimir Putin if it wanted to invite a foreigner to the Independence Day celebrations instead of an English Prince.
Addressing a news conference, PHU Leader MP Udaya Gammanpila said inviting an English Prince sends the message that we are still a colony at heart of the British,though we gained independence 70 years ago.
Members of the British Royal family are not worthy of being invited to celebrate the independence. They are the ones who took away our independence. If the government wanted to invite a foreigner, it should have invited Dr. Mahathir Mohamed who built the modern Malaysia. If it still wanted a 'white', then it could have invited Russian President Vladimir Putin who is a symbol of patriotism and independence," he said.
He said the United National Party opposed to inviting Prince Charles to the Independence Day celebrations 20 years ago during former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga's tenure.
"In Parliament, MP W. J. M. Loku Bandara criticized this move. However, the same UNP today has made Prince Charles's brother Prince Edward as Chief Guest of the 70-year anniversary celebrations of independence, he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Petrol bomb thrown at Suu Kyis lakeside villa
	
THE HINDU, 01st FEBRUARY, 2018-A petrol bomb was thrown at the lakeside Yangon compound of Myanmars leader Aung San Suu Kyi on Thursday while she was away from her home, a government spokesman said. It was a petrol bomb, spokesman Zaw Htay confirmed to AFP, without giving further details on a possible motive for a small but rare attack targeting the Myanmar democracy heroine.
The petrol bomb caused minor damage. But the attack on the villa where Ms. Suu Kyi was held for long years of house arrest by the former junta is hugely symbolic.
Ms. Suu Kyi has increasingly attracted the ire of the international community over her perceived failure to speak up on behalf of Myanmars Rohingya Muslim community.
Nearly 7,00,000 Rohingya have fled a brutal military crackdown in northern Rakhine state into refugee camps in Bangladesh since August, bringing with them testimony of murder, rape and arson.
But inside Myanmar, Ms. Suu Kyi, who swept elections in 2015, is still widely regarded as a heroine by the majority-Buddhist population, who fondly dub her The Lady.
Many inside Myanmar regard the Rohingya as illegal Bengali immigrants.Ms. Suu Kyi was in Naypyidaw at the time of Thursdays incident and is due to address parliament to mark the second anniversary of her NLD government coming to power.

President never meant taking over any ministry: Harsha
	
President Maithripala Sirisena never meant taking over any ministry when he recently said that he would take over the responsibility of controlling the economy, Policy Planning and Economic Affairs Deputy Minister Dr. Harsha de Silva said yesterday.
Dr. de Silva told a news briefing last afternoon that the President only meant taking control of the National Economic Council. The President spoke to me minutes after the statement he made on talking over economic affairs under his purview and told me that he never meant taking over any ministry," Dr. de Silva said.
If the President had the intention of taking over any ministry he would have done so by now," he said.
Responding to a question as to whether UNPers including him will allow the party to remove MP Ravi Karunanayake from the Assistant Leader's post, Dr. De Silva said no one could stop what the Marapone Commission had recommended. He said the Working Committee of the party would decide the fate of Mr. Karunanayake by the middle of this month.
Referring to an allegation made by Sri Lanka Podu Jana Party that inflation had gone up , the Deputy Minister said it had actually gone down. The total spending on essential commodities had gone down by Rs 500 in 2017. Also he said number of employment opportunities created last year had been increased by 4,63, 869 in 2017 compared to 2014. Construction of roads is not stopped but what had come to a standstill is taking commissions out of road development projects" he added in response to allegations that is to bring made by the opposition.
Commenting on the proposed Active Liability Management Bill, Dr De Silva said it will be used exclusively to manage liabilities. Elaborating on the debt situation he said the present government will soon manage the debt trap which the county has been entangled in since the previous regime took over the government. The Rajapaksa administration borrowed mostly for recurrent expenditure. The last government never maintained an asset management registry show that assets the government possessed during that time. However this government has begun working on such a registry, he said while highlighting that this government is making effort to extend the debt repayment period. He added that the previous government had gone for heavy commercial borrowing unlike the present government. Previous government borrowed at 8.9 percent from NSB and borrowed from DFCC at 9.9 percent, he added, (Yohan Perera)

Rains increase threat of Dengue outbreak
	
The intermittent rains experienced in many parts of the country right now has increased the threat of a dengue outbreak, while the number of dengue cases reported in the first five weeks of 2018 stood at 6,203 by today, with five deaths.
The Government Epidemiology Unit (GEU) announced today that during the last 12 months of the year 2017, 184,442 suspected dengue cases have been reported to the Epidemiology Unit throughout the island.
Approximately 41.53% of dengue cases were reported from the Western province. The GEU said this situation warrants regular removal of possible mosquito breeding sites from the environment and it is important to seek medical attention in the event of fever by day three of the illness.
Meanwhile, Health and Indigenous Medicine Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said the Health Ministry would do its utmost to prevent a dengue outbreak, though the year 2018 has been identified as a dengue epidemic year, and added that it was common that a dengue epidemic has been experienced once in every two years in the last couple of decades.
We have used so many chemical, biological and traditional methods to control dengue with limited success. For instance the use of BTI (Bacillus Thuringiensis Israelensis), vaccine and fumigation did not bring desired results. We have now decided to introduce a natural bacteria species Wolbachia that would control transmitting dengue virus by mosquitoes to humans with foreign assistance, Minister Senaratne said.
He said the Ministry of Health will enter into a Collaboration Agreement with the University of Monash, Australia under the World Mosquito Programme, on the implementation of the proposed Wolbachia Project in selected areas of the Colombo District endemic for dengue, at a cost of A$ 1 million (Rs. 120 million).
Aedes aegypti is the main vector for dengue in Sri Lanka. Vector control is the main strategy to control the spread of the disease. However, traditional vector control strategies have so far failed to curb the increasing incidence and therefore the disease has now become a key threat.
Use of Wolbachia bacterium to block the transmission of dengue virus is a novel control strategy introduced by scientists of Monash University, Australia. This bacterium is found naturally inside bodies of more than 60% of insect species, including some mosquito species in the world. , the Minister said. (Sandun A Jayasekera)

Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe yesterday stressed that everyone including the Rajapaksas will be dealt with in the same way if they are found guilty of any wrong-doing.
The Prime Minister said this while speaking at an UNP election rally in Ampara last evening.The policy of the UNP is to not take sides but to take action against wrong-doers without considering whether they are Rajapaksas or anyone else if they are found guilty of a crime, he said.
We will catch all who have robbed public finances. This government was elected for that particular purpose. The wrong-doers will be dealt with legally. We have filed legal action against several members of the Rajapaksa family. We will also carry out investigations against UNPers who are accused of wrong-doing without favour, the Prime Minister added.
He assured that no one who has committed fraud will be spared just to make the party look good. Everyone should be considered equal under the law, he said.
Minister of Primary Industries Daya Gamage said a programme to grant title deeds to lands for the landless in Ampara will be implemented soon. He pointed out that the government had been successful in providing electricity to every village in the Ampara District and assured that the housing problems faced by the people in the district will also be resolved soon.

Reconciliation and the politics of forgetting
	
The North and the East today is not the North and the East that was eight years ago
Once in a while you come across amazing statements made by politicians and members of civil society that you just cant pass up. Or let go. Just the other day, Northern Provincial Council (NPC) Chairman C. V. K. Sivagnanam is reported to have said at a news conference that it is futile and meaningless to continue with the ban imposed on the LTTE within Sri Lanka. Since I am no speaker of Tamil, and since even my Sinhala is at best passable, I dont know how much was lost in translation from what Mr Sivagnanam originally spoke of. But the thrust of his arguments is clear, really: continuing with the ban is useless because those who were being banned dont exist. This argument, logical to some, provokes me to comment.

Words are made for scrambling. And unscrambling. Political rhetoric, on that count, is almost always malleable because it doesnt require anyone to maintain neutrality; its always politically coloured, always covered in bias. Sivagnanams words can consequently be twisted and turned to obtain whatever meaning the harbingers of peace on the one hand and unyielding chauvinists on the other want to. Since I follow neither of these camps and since my issue with those words have nothing to do with the politics of war and peace in Sri Lanka, I will instead concentrate on what I feel to be the real implications of this statement, centring on the need for reconciliation.
Its easy to forget and easy to forgive. All it takes is political willpower, which we in Sri Lanka, with the current Government, dont seem to lack as much as we did with the previous regime. But to forget and to forgive there must be a cause which compels memory and bitterness. I am not suggesting here that to let go we need to measure the political weight of each and every statement made by each and every politician, particularly those who come from political groups which were known at one point or the other to have spoken up for those causes provoking bitter memories, but I do appreciate the fact that this statement brings me, and the country, to that difficult question as to whether, if reconciliation is premised on punishing the wrongdoer without letting him or her off the hook, selective amnesia can be the best antidote.
Reconciliation process
Sivagnanam states in no uncertain terms that the time has come to consider releasing all LTTE suspects in custody and to let them integrate into society. The truth is that for all its deficits when it came to the reconciliation process, the previous regime kick-started several programs aimed at integrating LTTE cadres into those very same societies that shirked them. (Which was natural, I suppose, given that many of those cadres were considered as traitors by the people who bred them, nourished them, and then sent them to war against the State.) You can argue that these programs were not conceived properly, that they were done more out of a need to obtain votes for the Mahinda Rajapaksa Government from the North and the East (but then, of course, we can argue that even the TNA does this in every feel-good statement it issues), but at a time when every political act is committed with that end in view, you can also contend that the Government at least tried to rehabilitate those cadres. Yes, at least they tried.
Isnt it repeating the painfully obvious when we say that the LTTE was an outfit which was undeserving of the praise and nostalgia it compels today as the hegemonic regimes it waged a war against Isnt it stating what everyone knows when we say that no Government in the world has fast-tracked the processes of reconciliation and integration with respect to terrorist organisations proscribed by other countries if it was felt that fast-tracking those processes would be antithetical to the imperatives of sovereignty and autonomy that these countries privilege(d) To be fair by Sivagnanam, he does confess that the cadres should be integrated after taking the necessary legal precautions (he doesnt elaborate on them), but then thats followed by an outright absolutist remark; that the LTTE must no longer be banned.

Its easy to forget and easy to forgive. All it takes is political willpower, which we in Sri Lanka, with the current Government, dont seem to lack as much as we did with the previous regime
Reconciliation has its pitfalls and no one can say with any certainty that its the perfect antidote to a countrys ills, particular a country like ours which emerged out of a catastrophic, disastrous war a paltry eight years ago. The North and the East today is not the North and the East that was there before those eight years, but recent events (especially those as of yet unsolved incidents of swordfights and murders in broad daylight, and that street-gang going under the name AAVA) do tend to worry. If one peruses history, one can easily ascertain that two broad things compelled the rise of extremism in both the North and South; the apathy of the Government and the empowerment of alternative vigilante groups that sprang out of nowhere, but proved to be stronger than the official arms of the State in the areas they happened to operate in.
The NPC is asking us to forget. Well, I am all for forgetting. And so are a great many Sri Lankans I know, of whatever religious and racial affiliation. But what does forgetting and forgiving really entail Does it entail forgetting and forgiving those horrendous crimes against humanity perpetrated by the LTTE, and if so, does that act of letting bygones be bygones apply to the Armed Forces, which the likes of the NPC and the TNA and, elsewhere, the Global Tamil Forum, are adamant on bringing to a foreign court, too If one chooses to let go of the LTTEs past, will one be as willing, in the interests of reconciliation, to let go of the Armed Forces Would those documentaries and docudramas financed by news agencies abroad then have been to nothing, then And if so, would all this political rhetoric over the Army being tried (even Mahesh Senanayake, a man I admire, has reiterated the need to try the bad egg soldiers who broke conventions while in the battlefield) be just that: empty rhetoric

Southeast Asia's top drugmaker eyes SL
	
PT Kalbe Farma, whose antacid drug Promag is a household name in Indonesia, is seeking a partner in Sri Lanka and eyeing the Middle East as a new market for its nutritional products.
The pharmaceutical company, Southeast Asias biggest, will initially export its products to Sri Lanka before joining hands with a local company to manufacture its generic drugs, President Director Vidjongtius said in an interview in Jakarta on Tuesday. Its also expanding to the Middle East after the positive response to test-marketing of its packaged coconut water, he said.
Kalbe, which started out from a garage in Jakarta five decades ago, derives about 94 percent of its sales from the local market with prescription drugs, consumer health and nutritional products. As local sales remain sluggish, the Jakarta-based company is focusing on new markets to broaden its reach beyond Southeast Asia, Vidjongtius said.
Our focus has been Asean so far and we have been quite successful, said Vidjongtius, who took over as the president director in June 2017. Our ultimate mission is to develop a portfolio for the developed and more regulated countries like the U.S. and Europe. We are upgrading our quality standards to global level.
Kalbe is more optimistic about the outlook for sales and profit this year than in 2017 as it starts selling new products and targets more markets, Vidjongtius said. The company probably ended 2017 with revenue and profit growth of about 4 percent to 5 percent, he said, ahead of the release of its full-year audited earnings.
The outlook for Kalbe remains challenging in the short term, said Vanessa Karmajaya, an analyst at Yuanta Securities Indonesia.
For energy drinks, the market is getting saturated due to perceived health concerns, Karmajaya said. Exports and imports of drugs are getting highly regulated so it would be tough for them to grow this segment. They have diversified into a new segments like dialysis and supplying medical consumables and these markets in the longer term could be positive.
Kalbe, which gets about a third of its revenue from distribution and logistics, is open to roping in an equity partner for the unit, Vidjongtius said. The subsidiary, PT Enseval Putera Megatrading, has presence in 53 Indonesian cities and derives about 30 percent of its revenue from third parties. (bloomberg)

A meeting had taken place at a location in Colombo at a special request by the Speaker. The Speaker had explained to both the leaders that excessive political hostility displayed in the election platforms could become a hindrance to achieve Yahalapana objectives.
Hon. President, Hon.Prime Minister, I am making a request. There is no politics here. As the Speaker, I am independent. I see that the orators from both the parties relentlessly expressing their views in political platforms. We have a plan of work to be achieved. We have to fulfil the objectives of late Ven. Maduluwave Sobhitha Thera. The economy has become unstable due to certain political speeches. There is fear in the minds of investors. The Stock Exchange can collapse. Investors think the country will turn unstable after the election. The international community, that got close to us recently, is facing a problem over this. Such problems will not be good for the country. I am humblymaking a request for both of you to limit your hostility in the political stage. It is the need of the moment, the Speaker said.
Political sources said that both the leaders cordially agreed with the request by the Speaker. (Ranjan Kasthuri)

Sri Lanka has done well in being aware of cancer
	

The month of February sheds light on a very important subject: Cancer. Its in February that we celebrate World Cancer Day. It falls on February 4. Cancers have become a serious threat to health all over the world, Sri Lanka is no different. World Cancer Day focuses on raising awareness on cancer prevention. This weeks edition of the Health Capsule joins in raising awareness on cancer prevention. This is why we spoke to two medical professionals regarding this malady. Dr. Jayantha Balawardana, Senior Counsultant Oncologist, Radio Therapist and Senior Lecturer at the Kothalawala Defence University shared his medical expertise on the disease, answering all questions related to cancer. Dr. W.D. Deepika Wijesinghe, Medical Officer, Base Hospital, Homagama, explained how cancers are detected and patient are sent for treatment. 
Dr. Balawardana explained what a cancer is. Cancers are abnormal growths in the body that seem to have no control. In the human body, cells divide according to a regular pattern with some control and limitation. The body cells divide only when necessary. There are instances when cells start dividing uncontrollably due to various factors. The division is not relayed by any regulation. This is what we call a cancer, explicated Dr. Balawardana. He further explained that it develops into a malignant tumor. This malignant tumor starts destroying the organ of its origin and later starts spreading to other organs, eventually spreading throughout the body. This could lead to grave consequences such as multi organ failure and become fatal. 
According to Dr. Balawardana, the most common type of cancer among Sri Lankan women is breast cancer whereas it is bowel and lung cancers with regard to males in this island. Cervical cancers in women used to be on the rise, but with increased awareness and the treatment now available in the island, cervical cancer has reduced. Oral cancer used to be high among men, but with time it has shown a reduction.

Causative factors 
There are various causes for cancers. Dr. Balawardana mentioned various factors that could lead to cancers. One such reason is the type of food that is included in your daily diet. The excessive consumption of animal fats and red meats could increase the probability of developing bowel cancers. Processed food is also a cause for stomach cancers. Foods that lead to obesity should be avoided as much as possible. Obesity has led the way for numerous cancers in patients which includes very commonly present cancers such as breast cancers, bowel cancers, and thyroid cancers amongst various other types of cancers, he stated. 
He accentuated that environmental pollution has become a strong cause behind the prevalence of lung cancers. This is more commonly seen in industrialized and urban areas rather than rural locations. Radiation is another cause for cancers. The ozone layer of earths atmosphere prevents harmful UV rays of the sun from reaching earth by absorbing them. However with the increasing depletion of this protective layer due to human activities, more of the suns rays reach the earths surface. Therefore we are directly exposed to the radiation which could induce skin cancers. 
Hormonal factors of the body are said to be a reason for the occurrence of cancers especially in women. Unmarried women, women with no children or even women who have children in their later years, are said to be vulnerable to several cancers, the predominant type being breast cancer. Tobacco, smoking and alcohol are reasons that give way to lung and oral cancers. Viruses are another causative factor for cancers. The human papilloma virus or HPV causes womb cancers in women. The AIDS virus HIV is also indirectly a causative factor of some cancers. There are liver and bladder parasites that could lead to liver and bladder cancers. Certain drugs induce cancers. Finally genetics, where changes in genes and a family history of cancers are seen, also have an impact as a causative factor, listed Dr. Balawardana.

Cardinal signs 
Symptoms of cancers may vary according to the type of cancer. However Dr. Balawardana stressed that there are cardinal signs that could raise alarms in you warning about the disease. Early detection aids the treatment process. A patient may suffer from one or more of the following symptoms. These may include a long standing cough, a long standing change in the voice, voice becomes course, difficulty in swallowing, unexplained fever, enlargement of glands such as lymph, unnecessary lumps in parts of the body, bleeding from the nipple, irregular bowel habits, bleeding when urinating or bleeding from the rectum, sudden change in beauty spots (indication of a severe condition known as melanoma), unexplained loss of weight and cervical bleeding after sexual activity, he warned. 
After diagnosis of the patients condition, treatments will be carried out. Treatments vary according to the type of cancer, but some generalized treatment methods can be considered. Performing surgeries and operations is common. Chemotherapy, radiotherapy, immunotherapy, and novel therapy are other treatment methods. There are cancers that are 100% curable. There are certainly some nasty cases of cancer as well, but cancers are potentially curable. Early detection is the key, the oncologist said. 

Early Detection
As preventive methods there are steps that we can take to ensure the prevention of cancer. By making sure to avoid causative factors (previously mentioned) you can go a long way in preventing the disease. At the first signs of any of the above mentioned cardinal signs, one must seek medical advice. There are screening programs available for breast and cervical cancers for women. Blood and other tests are easily available to keep your health condition updated. Oral hygiene should be looked into and its important to have regular check-ups, he said. Our main focus should be towards leading a healthy lifestyle. Following a healthy diet and life practices like taking regular exercise and keeping weight under control are essential. Avoid alcohol and smoking. Regular screening will help early detection. 
Dr. Balawardana assured that cancer patients should not dread the disease. He stressed on the importance of early detection. Through early detection one third of the cancers can be prevented. Another one third of cancers can be treated successfully while the remainder can be addressed using novel treatment. Patients should not think that cancers are a social stigma or remain in denial. Seek timely medical attention and you will be fine, he accentuated. 

Medical attention 
When you encounter certain health issues, you might always seek out your family doctor, a general physician first. A cancer is a condition you may not want to be diagnosed with understandably. Dr. Wijesinghe explained how patients, upon general consultation, are directed for screening with the view of diagnosing for cancer.
She explained that there is a reason that the disease is called cancer. 
The word cancer originates from the Greek language where cancer means crab. Just like a crab can crawl all over the place, the disease spreads throughout the body. And so the disease was called such. To prevent the cancer from spreading it is necessary to treat the condition early and for that diagnosis is essential, she added. Dr. Wijesinghe explained how patients are directed for diagnosis and treatment. When a patient complains about certain symptoms and if a suspicion of a cancer arises, we direct them for various tests. We check the patients health, family history and examine them. The conducting of investigations and tests such as x rays, CT scans, PET scans, biopsies, blood tests are various methods advised in diagnosing the patients condition. Under strong suspicions or affirmation of the disease, the patient is directed to a specialist consultant under whose supervision theyll receive treatment from experienced consultants, she mentioned. 

Increasing awareness 
She further stated that at present Sri Lanka is in a healthy position when it comes to cancer awareness. Sri Lanka is showing improvement in terms of cancer awareness. Various treatments are also available for cancer. There is a vaccine for cervical cancer against the human papilloma virus. Girls are advised to get the vaccine at age 13. AIDs can also lead to cancers. Sri Lanka is active in raising awareness on AIDS. Children should be educated. Parents should be made aware. There are various means and methods through which cancer awareness is widely operated. Media plays an important role in this as well. By raising awareness, the public is made more vigilant regarding signs and symptoms. Their eyes are opened to the importance of early detection and they will realize that help is always available. By shedding light on the vaccinations and precautions that can be taken, cancer threats can be further reduced. Educating the people and raising awareness are the main pointers in the path to cancer prevention, she concluded.

Stepping forward to a healthy life
	
Living a healthy life is a challenge that many people take up. In a landscape where fast food chains, attractive beverages and easy lifestyles are being promoted, one finds that leading a healthy life stands well away from reality. Adding to this are the daily stressors of life such as going to work, keeping up with deadlines etc. As much as we think that a healthy life is about not getting sick, it has to do a lot with the proper calorie intake and also maintaining a good overall well-being.
In order to shed light on living a healthy life, Mount Elizabeth Hospitals together with Parkway Cancer Centre and CanHope Colombo conducted a programme with two experienced medical personnel. Enlightening the audience on the proper way to a healthy life, Dr. See Hui Ti and Dr. Chuan Hsuan-Hung from Mount Elizabeth Orchard shared their experiences and a few tips;
Control the intake of sugar in your lives : Dr. See Hui Ti
Speaking on the topic Prevent and Fight Cancer, Dr. See Hui Ti, Senior Medical Oncologist at the Mount Elizabeth Orchard said that tobacco is one of the main causes of cancer. We all do things that keep us alive and its important to be happy. I love food and I grew up loving food. One thing is that we love to smell food and we love to taste things. Smell is more important than taste. With regard to cancer patients the first thing that they lose is their sense of smell. Food can taste really good, but it may not be good food whereas some food can taste really bad, but it may be good for us. So when we focus on nutrition we dont have to worry about eating too much or too little. If you are having enough nutrition you wouldnt be hungry. Studies have shown that up to 40% - 50% of the cancer risk comes from our lifestyle; be it smoking, be it lifestyle. We see smoking, diet and activity pattern topping the list. This is followed by alcohol and microbial agents. We know that smoking causes lung cancer. More often than not we meet patients who dont smoke or drink and still develop cancer. Therefore its important to know that the food that we think is good could actually cause a lot of difficulties in future.said Dr. Ti.
Elaborating more on cancer Dr. Ti said that carcinogenesis takes place when DNA is damaged and it is therefore irreparable. This could happen in events such as excessive sunlight, smoking, infections and even inflammation which results from over eating and obesity. It takes between five days to 20 years to build on carcinogenesis. Dietary and activity habits start young. If we dont teach our children how to eat and how to exercise, they will grow up having misconceptions and misunderstandings about how to eat. When we begin smoking at the age of 15 we find it very difficult to stop. When you reach 40-45 you realize that your aches and pains get in your way. This is when you should realize that what you eat needs to be controlled. We can get addicted to sugar and sweet-tasting food, but it is important to know what we are putting in to our mouths in the long run. Nasopharyngeal or nose cancer used to be the most common type of cancer especially in Singapore due to inaccessibility of good food. It takes years to build up carcinogenesis and it also takes years to reduce the risk of carcinogenesis. Whats picking up is colorectal cancer  which we also call the Cancer of the Rich. There are those among us who eat as much as they can and dont move about because there are maids in the house. They have chauffeurs to take them around. This gradually increases the inflammation in the colon leading to colon cancer. Breast cancer in women also develops as a result of easy access to good food and easy access to sweets. Cervical cancer seems to have declined due to regular screenings.he added.
Speaking further she said that by deep frying potatoes and other vegetables we take away what is good in them. In case if you eat fast food you need to balance it out with vegetables. There is also a clear distinction between fruits and vegetable juice. While fruit juice has a high content of sugar, vegetable juice is high in micronutrients. Its important to eat food while its fresh. We like to keep food in the refrigerator and eat the following day. But this could cause molds and other bacterial developments which could infect you. It has also been found that fatty livers are the primary cause of liver cancers. This could be caused due to chronic diabetes and the consumption of high sugary food. You can eat chocolate and sugary foods as long as you can keep your weight down. The key here is the Body Mass Index. The Metabollic syndrome  a condition of diabetes, high blood pressure and central obesity is known to cause menopause or endometrial cancer or womb cancer etc. This is the same with men. So we need to control the intake of sugar in our lives, she said.
In her concluding remarks Dr. Ti said that exercise can reduce the chances of contracting diseases. It can lower the levels of hormones such as insulin and oestrogen and certain growth factors that have been associated with the development of cancer. Reducing inflammation and improving the immune system are two other benefits. People who are most active can reduce the risk of developing 13 types of cancers. Even for people who have lower activity levels, if they at least engage themselves in two and a half hours of brisk walking it will lower their risk of developing cancer. So you can change your risk of developing cancer by changing your lifestyle, she said.
Health is not the absence of sickness : Dr. ChuanHsuan-Hung
Dr. Chuan Hsuan-Hung, Senior Medical Cardiologist at the Mount Elizabeth Orchard, then spoke about having a healthy heart. He said that the current generation thinks about consuming as much food as possible without considering how it will be burnt. Therefore we see people going to sleep just after having dinner and similar other behaviours. When we sleep we burn less calories and where will the remaining calories go This is how fatty liver develops. One of my priorities is to correct the eating habits of my patients. Dinner time is where we socialize with the family and if you can add a bit of walking after dinner, it would help strengthen family ties even more. Intermittent fasting allows the body to reach a low sugar state. But practically speaking its not something very sustainable. Its not advisable for heart patients to follow this rule,said Dr. Chuan.
Speaking further Dr. Chuan said that non-communicable diseases are not an issue affecting only developed countries. For the past many years we have seen the increasing number of cases with non-communicable diseases in developing countries as well. Many risk factors will affect you in various ways. Health is not only the absence of sickness, but it is also about having a healthy mind and the overall well-being. A list of behaviours including no smoking, eating a healthy diet, maintaining a healthy weight, exercising regularly, drinking alcohol in moderation and getting adequate sleep are known to contribute to your health. These work for different people in different ways. Reducing weight can bring about a huge difference in your life. If you can stop one snack or burn equal amount of calories you can achieve this goal, Dr. Chuan concluded.

## Title: 70th Independence and Youth

70th Independence and Youth
	
For the 70th Independence Day which is to be held on the 4th of February this year (2018), the youth have come together in celebrating Independence Day for the very first time in Sri Lanka. Under the name 70th Independence and Youth, the forum on the 04th of February, 2018 at Lakshman Kadiragamar Institute from 2.00 p.m. onwards is being organized by The Road to Rights Youth-led Organization.
 
Under this theme, the plan is to bring the youth together from various platforms to have an intelligent dialogue on many cross -cutting issues found in Sri Lanka. The National Independence Day is celebrated all over the country, mainly in Colombo, with parades, flag hoisting ceremonies and the nationally-televised speeches. However, the youth do not have any contribution when it comes to this except for the participation in the parade, made by schools. Sri Lanka went through many struggles to gain independence and this is something that every person must reflect on and value.
However, it is time for the youth to reflect on past achievements, especially bringing a discussion among the youth on where it went right in the process building a better future for Sri Lanka.

After Independence was gained in 1948, there were 2 major youth struggles caused in 1971 and 1981 and including the conflict in the North, altogether we lost more than 200,000 youth. Behind these struggles, the main point was the need to live, to have an income and to be employed. Through these incidents, Sri Lanka has been going through various social transformations politically, economically, and socially. Today in 2018, we stand on the post-war era where there are many transformations in the country. As young people, we have a key role to play in contributing to the nation building process while identifying ourselves as global citizens. This is why, as a youth-led organization The Road to Rights is bringing 70th Independence and Youth to create a conversation among youth to identify their role in drawing the way to a sustainable future.
 
At the 70th Independence & Youth forum there will be two panel discussions on some major points relating to the youth and the society and it will consist of three key speakers who will be delivering a speech leading to an open discussion with the participation of youth. There will be 150 young individuals representing leading youth networks, organizations, various sectors, as well as young professionals, young entrepreneurs, social media influencers, and journalists

We also plan on incorporating the outcomes of this forum into a formal document which will be presented to the President, Prime Minister, and other policy decision-makers in the country. It will also be posted on social media, blogs, and websites. Delegates will have the opportunity to interact with the speakers, while the forum will be live streaming on many websites. We will also mobilize young people to engage with the forum virtually through leading volunteer networks.

Making this forum a reality, the founder of The Road to Rights youth-led organization, Mr. Ashan Perera and its volunteers are behind this unique forum. The Road to Rights was established in 2009 in Sri Lanka and it is aimed at supporting young people towards creating opportunities, skills development, creativity, and innovation by taking a human rights-based approach towards peace and development. The Road to Rights is a key partner in promoting Sustainable Development Goals through the activities of the organization. Taking another step towards humanity and human rights education, Road to Rights have yet again come up with another initiative to bring in youth together and make a better Sri Lanka.
The Road to Rights is giving the youth reading this, a chance to participate in this forum.

## Title: The dark side of Body Shaming

The dark side of Body Shaming
	

Body shaming, intentionally causing emotional hurt to a person, can be considered as a form of bullying

That actress is too fat!. Hes too skinny!. How many times a day do we hear or read remarks like that We hear such comments on our way to work, read them when browsing the internet or hear them during conversations with friends. But these seemingly innocent remarks carry a more sinister undertone to them than we think. There have been recent incidents in some countries where people committed suicide as a result of someone making such comments which is termed body shaming. 
Most of us have experienced body shaming at one time or another in our lives. Some of us have been victimized by it while the others have played a part in making another person a victim. There is a misplaced belief in our society that body shaming is for the persons own benefit, especially when such comments are directed towards people who are obese or overweight. This week, Health Capsule decides to explore more on body shaming. 

Definition
Body shaming is defined as the action or practice of humiliating someone by making mocking or critical comments about his or her body shape or size. With an economy which thrives by highlighting and pointing out the smallest defect in the body, and marketing products that cover up or remove those faults, this phenomenon is becoming increasingly common. 

Is it beneficial
One might argue that by making someone ashamed of his body weight it might help him in terms of giving him an incentive to lose weight. But research has shown that this is not the case with the majority. Body shaming negatively affects how a person sees his or her own body. A research done in the University of Pennsylvania revealed that overweight women who have a negative perception about their bodies have a greater risk of developing Diabetes and Heart Disease compared to overweight women who have a positive body image of their bodies.
In addition, there might be serious mental health issues that can occur as a result of body shaming. While one person might brush off a derogatory comment about his body and get on with his or her life, it might affect another person differently. Such comments might lead to severe depression and even suicidal thoughts, says Dr. Udena Attygalle, Consultant Adolescent Psychiatrist at the Karapitiya Teaching Hospital.
According to the doctor, body shaming may also be one root cause for eating disorders like Anorexia nervosa and Bulimia nervosa, which again can give rise to serious consequences. 

How to overcome effects from such comments
Body shaming, intentionally causing emotional hurt to a person, can be considered as a form of bullying, says Dr. Attygalle. If the person or people saying hurtful things do not listen when explained that it hurts you, the best thing is to get another person involved, may it be a parent or a friend, he explains. His advice is to avoid distressing contacts when possible, deviating the conversation to other things when the person starts to say things that are hurtful about the other persons body. 

How can we help
So, what if one of your loved ones really does need help with his body weight, especially if its a threat to his health How should you approach him or her 
Ones body image is a very personal issue, so the subject should be approached carefully, advices the doctor. He suggests using a positive approach rather than using negative comments, like encouraging them to participate in a sport as a form of exercise. 

Message to the parents
Results of another study conducted recently reveal that the majority of the body shamers started their habit when they were young; most likely from listening to the derogatory remarks made by their parents about other people and following in the same path. 
Therefore, being respectful when talking about other people, especially in the presence of your children and setting an example to them, can be the first step towards sweeping away the dark cloud of body shaming from the society one day.

## Title: Theft at Trinco Navy Holiday Bungalow

Theft at Trinco Navy Holiday Bungalow
	
A group of 19 locals and Sri Lankan Canadians have been stolen of cash and jewellery while on holiday at the heavily fortified - Command Headquarters- Eastern Naval Area, Trincomalee, on Tuesday night, the Daily Mirror learns.
The rogues had broken into the Bungalow located within the premises at which 19 persons including 11 females were staying. Initial observations of the group had revealed stolen cash and jewellery amounting to over 300,000 rupees.
 We were completely devastated when we found out early next morning, one of the tour group members told the Daily Mirror. According to the holiday makers which included family and extended family including Canadian citizens they had immediately informed the Naval Police upon discovery early morning on Wednesday.
The holiday makers had been staying at the Forest Side Holiday Resort located within the premises and under the supervision of the Navy when the incident had occurred.
From the time they ( the naval Police) walked in at 5.45 am they seemed to not want to find out what happened. Instead they checked our entire group and went in circles. Frustrated by this I asked them to secure the location and obtain finger prints to which they said there was no need, Jayalath Samarakkody told the Daily Mirror.
Navy Spokesperson Commander Dinesh Bandara confirmed the incident and said it was being investigated.
We dont take a theft of this nature lightly. A separate investigation into the theft is ongoing by the Navy and the Police have also been informed. The Holiday makers had said they wanted to leave for Canada and decided not to make a complaint to the Police. However, we are taking this incident very seriously and investigations are ongoing he said.
The group of tourists had arrived had the Eastern Command Naval base on Monday, January 29 as a part of a family outing.
The entire family included a group of 46 people stayed at 3 different bungalows within the command. 19 of us stayed at the Forest Side Holiday Resort at which the incident occurred Samarakkody said.
According to those present, they had slept at around 11.30 pm on Tuesday night after securing all entrances to the Bungalow. They had all slept in 3 rooms due to the in operation of one of the Air Conditioners in one of the rooms.
We woke up between 4.30 and 5 the next morning because we were to leave back to Colombo. Then we realized some of the belongings were missing. Upon further inspection we saw that a window and doors were opened. We immediately informed the Naval Police who arrived at the Bungalow Lalitha Padmini said.
She said that they were perturbed by the reactions of the officers.
We were shocked. The main thing they shouldve done was to either immediately call the Police or take over and investigate. Instead they wanted our group checked which they did and found nothing. And thereafter nothing else was done she said.
Relating the experience, Samarakkody, a Canadian citizen said: There were 19 of us and none of us woke up. We were staying at a heavily fortified area and they rouges knew the dimensions of it in detail. Thats how they entered. I cant understand why the scene wasnt secured and finger prints not taken or the fact that the Police were not called in he said.
Instead Samarakkody said that they were asked to proceed with a Police complaint by the Naval Police at around 12.00 Noon after the group was searched for 6 hours.
We had already spent our entire morning and afternoon undergoing this .We just wanted to leave the place. Some of us had flights to catch the next day ( today) so we wanted to leave the place as fast as possible he said.
However Samarakkody said that the Naval Police had refused to let them leave the premises without signing a statement which said that they did not require further investigation into the issue.
We were told to sign that our complaint was only made for the purpose of informing and not for the purpose of investigation- which is ridiculous. But we had to abide by it because we wanted to leave he said.
Samarakkody further said that he was informed by the Officer in Charge of the Naval Police that a bus had left the premises at 5 am that morning.
I told him to stop the bus or search it. They could have at least found some clue. But they didnt seem interested he said. (Hafeel Farisz)

Trump-FBI feud over classified memo erupts into open conflict
	

The long-simmering feud between President Trump and the Justice Department erupted into open conflict Wednesday when the FBI publicly challenged the presidents expected release of a contentious and classified memo related to the probe of Russian meddling in the 2016 election.
In a rare unsigned statement, the FBI cited grave concerns with inaccuracies and omissions in the four-page memo, which was written by House Republicans and alleges abuses at the Justice Department connected to secret surveillance orders. Trump has told advisers that the memo could benefit him by undercutting the special counsels investigation and allow him to oust senior Justice Department officials  and that he wants it released soon, something that could happen as early as Thursday.
We have grave concerns about the material omissions of facts that fundamentally impact the memos accuracy, the FBI said.
The extraordinary statement pits the nations top federal law enforcement agency against a commander in chief who already has fired one FBI director and has repeatedly expressed a desire to remove the attorney general and others connected to the Russia investigation. That probe, led by special counsel Robert S. Mueller III, is aimed in part at determining whether any Trump associates coordinated with Russian efforts to interfere in the 2016 election and investigating any related issues.
The FBIs public warning came after several days of failed attempts by FBI Director Christopher A. Wray and other Justice Department officials to convince the president and his senior staff in private meetings that the memo should be blocked because it poses a risk to national security.
Trump was captured

We arent eager to split the Unity Govt. - Mano Ganesan
	
TPA has gained recognition as a formidable political force
We want to be politically powerful in Colombo asSri Lankas commercial capital
UNP is a grand old party, but it behaves like an independent group in Colombo-North
Politics in Colombo- North afflicted by drug trafficking and underworld criminal activities
Obviously, there is a financial crime in thebond issue
Its important not only to recover the loss, but also to punish wrongdoers

Constitution making should be prioritized after LG polls

Minister of National Co-existence Dialogue and Official Languages Mano Ganesan in an interview with theDailymirrorspoke about the importance of the Local Government Elections and the future of the country. Ganesan, who is also the leader of the Tamil Progressive Alliance (TPA),said that his party had grown and is a force tobe reckoned with. Excerpts:

QAgainst the backdrop of diatribe between the United National Party (UNP) and the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP), what do you feel about the future as a leader of a minority party aligned with the Government
I am worried, but not excited. My political experience and maturity tell me that the situation isnt as bad as it is projected at the moment through the media, roadside talks and public discussions.
 
President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe have made a matchless match. They would lead this country out of the economic and political crisis.
 QYour party pinned a lot of hopes on this Government to deliver on constitutional reforms among other things. In that context, how do you view the present uncertainty
You are correct in one way. That is why I say I am worried. I am not excited. Though it is a Local Government Election, it has assumed national significance. We were having three elections per year earlier. Now, we have one election after three years. That is one thing. People are eager to turn up for voting. That is a good thing for democracy. The results of this election will be significant for the forward march of this country. Therefore, all the parties from the UNP right down to the minority parties will do their best to secure their share.
 Q How important are the elections from the viewpoint of your Tamil Progressive Alliance (TPA)
It is very, very important. The TPA led by me has gained recognition as a political party. We have six MPs- two cabinet ministers and one state minister. This election result will matter to us very much. We are mostly representing the Tamils living outside the north and the east. We are contesting in ten districts for 35 local authorities. We are contesting on our own for 15 of them. We will emerge as a victorious force at this election.
Though it is a Local Government Election, it has assumed national significance. We were having three elections per year earlier. Now, we have one election after three years. That is one thing. People are eager to turn up for voting
 Q What do you think of the final outcome
We are contesting in alliance with the UNP in some areas. In others, we are going solo. All the votes, obtained by all those contesting alone, will be put into one basket. This basket will be much heavier than the basket of the Joint Opposition, the JVP or the Tamil National Alliance (TNA). I am not contesting alone in the entire Colombo District. We contest with the UNP in Dehiwala- Mount Lavinia, Avissawella and Kolonnawa. We are contesting with the UNP in Wattala-Mabola Urban Council area. We are contesting on our own only in the Colombo Municipal Council area.
Colombo is the largest city in the country. The largest vote bank remains in Colombo. It is the financial capital. All the important political decisions are made in Colombo. We find the diplomatic community accredited to Sri Lanka based in Colombo. The Offices of the President and the Prime Minister are in Colombo. Therefore, it is very important for us to be politically powerful in Colombo. That is one of the reasons for us to contest separately.

In Colombo, my list includes not only Tamils, but also Sinhalese and Muslims.
Q In Colombo, you are contesting alone. We read reports about you saying that there were drug traffickers and underworld operators serving in this Government. Who are you referring to it
Yes of course. It is everybodys guess. I cannot name the person. I do not mention the name of the party. In Colombo-North, we experienced underworld shootings in the recent past. Immediately after the announcement of the election, there was a shooting incident. Some were killed and others were injured. The police are yet to name the culprits. Police called it a gunfire between underworld groups. One week before the announcement of the elections, there was a shooting incident in Modara. I visited the victims household. It is a Sinhalese family. At the last parliamentary elections, you will recall there was gunfire in Bloemendhal Street.
This election result will matter to us very much.
We are mostly representing the Tamils living outside the north and the east. We are contesting in ten districts for 35 local authorities. We are contesting on our own for 15 of them
 
The Colombo-North area is afflicted by underworld elements. Underworld criminal activities are always linked with drug trafficking. Both go hand in hand.
Q How will this criticism affect your relations with the UNP
I am a matured person. There is the Sinhalese adage Nahayath Ekka Tharahawela Muna Kapa Ganne ( It is unwise for one to get angry with his nose and cut the face). The UNP is a grand old party. The grand old party has stooped down to the level of an independent political group in Colombo-North. It is the party that gained independence for the country and produced stalwarts like D.S.Senanayake, Dudley Senanayake, Ponnambalam Ramanathan, T.B. Jayah, S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike and D.A. Rajapaksa. Therefore, the situation is worrisome even for non-UNPers. Yet, I cannot see the UNP leadership being worried. That is my real worry.
 Q There is acrimony between the UNP and President Maithripala Sirisena. How will it affect the future of the national unity Government
We had a recent meeting with the Prime Minister and the other stalwarts of the UNP. The participants at the meeting wanted to counter the President who said that he would form a SLFP-led Government if all his MPs stood behind him. The UNP-led alliance has more numbers. Therefore, it stands a better chance of forming its own Government.
 
We are not eager to split the Unity Government. We still want to continue with the Unity Government. The first reason is to work out a solution to the national question. That is the constitution making process.
 Q How hopeful are you of a solution to the national question
I am an optimist. I never give up. I only grow up. We have had discussions with the Prime Minister. I had a discussion with the President. They are determined to proceed with the task come what may after the elections are over. There is a period of lull in that regard because of the elections. It should be the first priority after the election.
We are equally sensitive. Tamils being only concerned about the national issue is now in the past. There was a time when the right to life was the only concern. Now it is different. Times are changing. The young generation is worried
 Q With regard to the Tamil people whom you represent, how sensitive are they to the frauds in bond trading of the Central Bank under the Government
We are equally sensitive. Tamils being only concerned about the national issue is now in the past. There was a time when the right to life was the only concern. Now it is different. Times are changing. The young generation is worried. They are very much interested in knowing more and more about the bond issue.
 Q What is your position
Obviously, there had been a financial crime in this case. The Presidential Commission, appointed by our own Government, investigated it and submitted the report. If somebody denies any financial crime in this case, he is fooling himself. Criminals need to be identified. They should be brought before the law.
We had a recent meeting with the Prime Minister and the other stalwarts of the UNP. The participants at the meeting wanted to counter the President who said that he would form a SLFP-led Government if all his MPs stood behind him. The UNP-led alliance has more numbers. Therefore, it stands a better chance of forming its own Government

It is not only the recovery of the loss. The culprits should be brought to book. That is the stand of the whole Government. The UNP leader is keen that the culprits should be punished. There are culprits not directly connected to the scam. They should also be brought to book.
 
In addition to the report on the bond scam, there is another report regarding 34 cases. We are going to debate all that on February 6. During election times, it will be a political debate.
