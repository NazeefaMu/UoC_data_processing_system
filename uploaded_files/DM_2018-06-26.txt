Unending depreciation of LKR  against USD
	

The media and politicians in the opposition are making a big fuss over the depreciation of the Sri Lankan rupee against the US dollar these days. Almost every day we read news items headlined Rupee hits all-time low or Rupee hits record low. Now the rate against the dollar is almost Rs.160. 
Although this is not an exaggeration or distortion of facts, and also points to the gravity of the economic situation in the country, it is never an unprecedented situation as the politicians in the opposition attempt to portray. The rupee has been depreciating continually and almost regularly since it was allowed to float against the US dollar some 40 years ago. Previously, we had the exchange rate control system which did not show the real depreciation of the rupee on a regular basis. On the eve of the rupee being allowed to float by President J.R. Jayewardenes government in 1980 with the introduction of the open economy, the rupee stood at Rs.8 against the dollar and with the decision to allow the Sri Lankan currency to float, the dollar right away shot up steeply to Rs.16.
Since then, irrespective of which political party governed the country, the rupee had depreciated reaching the current rate. There had been slight fluctuations in some years during these nearly 40 years, but they did not disturb the general trend of depreciation. Therefore, with increase of the price of the dollar by each rupee, it was a situation where Rupee hits all-time low or Rupee hits record low and the opposition of the day made a big hue and cry as if it had never happened.
The depreciation had been a huge issue among the opposition ranks when the rate hit Rs.50, Rs.100 and Rs.150. Again, they would make an uproar in the near future when it reaches Rs.200. One can recall when the dollar rose to Rs.100 in 2004 (during President Chandrika Kumaratungas tenure), the United National Party (UNP), the then main opposition party making a similar outcry.
Whenever depreciation of the local currency came to the fore, governments of the day had been used to say it would help exports or tourism, which has been historically disproved. In fact, it is the exports that can stop or slow down the depreciation of the local currency, leave alone seeing an appreciation of it and not the other way around. Because exports rely on so many other important factors such as tax concessions and room for expansion of production. On the other hand, every time the rate goes up, politicians in the opposition accuse the government of increasing import expenditure. These arguments are, in a way, dogmatic and unrealistic. Neither group wants to see the issue in its real context and find solutions to it; rather than politicizing the rupee depreciation.
For more than one and a half centuries before 1978, Sri Lanka has been maintaining a plantation-based economy which in its initial decades grew rapidly and later remained stagnant. Accordingly, the development which in its real sense is generation of employment and income too remained stagnant. The economy somewhat diversified with the Mahaweli Development Projects and the open economy which was kicked off with the establishment of free trade zones during J.R. Jayewardene regime. They were indeed positive steps in terms of income generation and employment generation.
Henceforth, we did not see any factories coming up or any other development projects that can considerably generate employment and income materializing. Occasionally, we hear experts pointing out that only an export-driven economy can stabilize the rupee, but it always fell on deaf ears of those concerned.
The Yahapalanaya Government boasted it would attract foreign investments and increase exports which would be facilitated by the free trade agreements with various countries and ultimately create one million job opportunities in five years. The governments failure in seeing the realization of that scheme resulted in its humiliating defeat at the February 10 local government elections. Yet, the government has to look at the issue afresh and find ways to minimize the effects of the rupee depreciation since it is solely the responsibility of the government.

US Supreme Court upholds Trump's travel ban
	
The US Supreme Court has ruled in favour of the President Donald Trump's travel ban targeting people from several Muslim-majority countries, BBC reported today.
Lower courts had deemed the ban unconstitutional, but the Supreme Court has reversed this decision in a 5-4 ruling which announced on Tuesday.
The ban prohibits most people from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Syria and Yemen from entering the US.
The court's reversal is viewed as a victory for the Trump administration. But the travel ban has been widely criticised by refugee and human rights groups.
Chief Justice John Roberts wrote the opinion, which said the travel ban was "squarely within the scope of Presidential authority".
"The Government has set forth a sufficient national security justification to survive rational basis review. We express no view on the soundness of the policy."
Shortly after the Supreme Court released its decision, President Donald Trump shared the news from his Twitter account.
Omar Jadwat, director of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) Immigrant Rights Project said in a statement that the ruling was one of the Court's "great failures".
"The court failed today, and so the public is needed more than ever. We must make it crystal clear to our elected representatives: If you are not taking action to rescind and dismantle Trump's Muslim ban, you are not upholding this country's most basic principles of freedom and equality."
Mr Jadwat likened the Court's decision to the ruling which upheld Japanese-American internment during World War Two.

We have brought a sense of freedom  into the  country
	

TEA FACTORIES SET ON FIRE DURING 1971, 1981 JVP INSURGENCY
	
	CONSTITUTION MAKING PROCESS STALLED TO A POINT
	
	IT CANNOT BE VALUED IN RUPEES AND CENTS
	
	PEOPLE ARE PAYING RS.450 BILLION TO MAINTAIN CERTAIN INSTITUTIONS
	
	AS HIGHWAYS MINISTER, I BUILT 700 ROADS IN ALL DISTRICTS
	
	UNP WILL SUPPORT JVPS 20 A


Public Enterprise and Kandy City Development Minister Lakshman Kiriella, in an interview with Daily mirror , discusses the proposed plans for restructuring state institutions and the political future of the government. He also responds to allegations about the acquisition ofland from theknuckles range.
The Excerpts:- 

Q How do you analyze the current status of politics
Everyone is getting ready for the next presidential election. We want to educate people on our achievements during the past years. We have brought a sense of freedom into the country. The rule of law is widely upheld by the government. We do not interfere with the judiciary. There is no abduction of ordinary people or journalists. Disappearances have ceased to exist. We have the pride of place in the international community. There is press freedom. The Right to Information Act was brought about. It was something opposed by the previous government. Though people look at development in terms of rupees and cents, our achievements are permanent and for the future. 

We have the pride of place in the international community. There is press freedom. The Right to Information Act was brought about. It was something opposed by the previous government

Q But, people voted out the UNP at the last local government elections. Why did it happen then
The local government election is a different dimension. People look at local government issues. At a national election, we are on a sound footing. We have brought a sense of freedom as I said earlier. We introduced decency to governance. 

QThere are talks about former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa coming forward as the candidate from the other side. What do you think of his candidacy
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe will be the UNP candidate. He is the only leader who has a vision for the country. 

Q I am asking about the candidacy of Gotabhaya Rajapaksa...
It is premature for me to comment on it. We do not know whether he will be the candidate or not. We hear about infighting in theRajapaksa family.

Q At the next Presidential Election, can you bring together all the political parties and forces that were under one banner in view of the Presidential Elections 2015
I am quite sure. When it comes to the crunch, the United National Front (UNF) that we formed for the last election will remain intact. 

Q The President and the Prime Minister harbour animosity. In that sense, is it practically possible
There will be a candidate from the UNP. The rank and file of the party wants a UNP candidate to be fielded this time. 

QSome UNPers say it is a mistake to have supported common candidates in 2010 and 2015. What is your view
A lot of UNPers feel that they were played out. Our government has done a lot of work. But, the media campaign to promote our work is not a success. The insurance scheme we introduced is a big boon to school children. It has not been canvassed properly. We brought down the prices of pharmaceuticals. It has not been canvassed. As the Highways Minister, I built 700 roads in all the districts. We have started work on the central expressway. It will open up the entire hill country.
It is going on.
The southern expressway took ten years to be completed. In another three years, we will be able to complete the central expressway. When I assumed office as the Minister of Highways, not a single inch of land had been acquired for the project. After I took office, we acquired 25,000 blocks of land. The Survey Department did a magnificent job in this regard.
The first section of the road project has been given to a Chinese company. They are doing it now. The second section is implemented by a local company. We will give the third section to a Japanese company. There are certain forces, within the government, trying to scuttle the project.

Q Why are they opposed to it actually
These are the very same people who supported an expressway up to Beliatta. They did so when they were with the Mahinda Rajapaksa government. I can understand an expressway linking Galle and Matara with Colombo. But, no one wanted an expressway to Beliatte other than the Rajapaksas. This is nothing but political hypocrisy(Kuhakakama). 

Q There are allegations against the government that it failed to implement the reform agenda, particularly constitutional reforms. What is your view
This is not a UNP government. This is a government of many parties with diverse views. For example, the UNP is keen to abolish the executive presidency. But, the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) is not ready for it.

The losses at SriLankan are due to inadvertent procurement. The previous govt purchased 15 aircraft. During the Yahapalana government, they leased them out at far beyond the market values

Q What do you think of the 20th Amendment brought in by the government to abolish the executive presidency
We, the UNP, will support it. I doubt whether the SLFP would do so.

Q But you play a leading role in the Constitution-making process at the Steering Committee as the Leader of the House...
It was always the SLFP that was pulling our legs. Most SLFP members who represent the Steering Committee left the government. They joined hands with Mahinda Rajapaksa. They are begging MR to accommodate them. What support can we expectfrom them 

QDoes it mean that the entire process has been stalled now
It is stalled now, up to a point. We will support the JVPs move to abolish the executive presidency. 
Q Is a new Constitution covering all aspects unlikely now
It is difficult to achieve because of differences. This is not a government led by the UNP alone. It is a government of many parties as I said.


I can understand an expressway linking Galle and Matara with Colombo. But, no one wanted an expressway to Beliatte other than Rajapaksas

Q The SLFP is still a part of the government. Cant you prevail upon them
They are with us superficially. But, their policies are totally different than that of ours. These SLFPers in the government have no future. Even if they join MR, they wont be elected by people at the election. Some of them would join the UNP. 

Q What are your current plans for SriLankan Airlines that comes under your ministry
It is being restructured. We have appointed a chairman and a new Board of Directors. I have asked them to reduce the volume of losses gradually. It could even be broken in three years. 


Q Initially, the target was to find a foreign partner to develop the Airline.Any progress to it
We are looking for it. First, the finances of the national career have to be brought under control. Today, it is spilling out of control. Out of the losses, bank interests account for 51%. We are negotiating with the banks to have some concession. We need lesser interests. 
Employees are the most important aspect. In 2008, we had a very good profit. The losses are due to inadvertent procurement. The previous government purchased 15 aircraft. During the Yahapalana government, they leased them out at far beyond the market values. These transactions contributed to losses. The last government had made procurement without Cabinet approval. Mihin Lanka isgrounded permanently. 
People are paying Rs.450 billion to maintain certain institutions. This is the biggest problem for the government. Are we going to continue safeguarding them This is what peoplehave to decide. 


It was always the SLFP that was pulling our legs. Most SLFPers who represent the Steering Committee left the govt. and joined handswith MR

QSome Ministers complain that officials are reluctant to work fearing being hauled up before the Financial Crimes Investigation Division (FCID). How do you react to it
That is rubbish. If you act properly, there is nothing to worry. I do not experience any such thing. As for restructuring, no one wanted to take over the estates in the Kandy district. They were in such a bad state. The government has to spend Rs.1,500 million a year to maintain them. Are we going to keep these estates as a burden or going to restructure them Janatha Estate Development Board cannot even pay EPF to its workers.
Therefore, Minister Kabir Hashim who handled it before me put forward a Cabinet proposal to take over the uneconomical lands of JEDB and Sri Lanka State Plantations Corporation [SLSPC] and be given to the private sector for development. These proposals are intact. There is one such estate which I visited recently, the workers only have work for two days a week. Workers asked me to find an investor who can give them work for five days aweek at least! 
There has been an outcry to stop these development programmes. We have decided to allocate a plot of seven perches of land to estate sector people. For the first time in history, estate workers are given the right to own land. There is an outcry against that too. 
That is why they have brought out this issue involving the Knuckles range. When Minister Kabir Hashim prepared the project proposals, he identified certain land areas with the help of five consultants. The lands which have been allocated are outside the Knuckles range. Our political opponents want to prevent us from giving land to estate workers. Therefore, they raise non-existingenvironmental issues. 
QActually, former JVP MP Samantha Vidyaratne is spearheading a campaign against it
They are the people who set fire to factories in 1971 and in1981!

Young lovers hire 'mother' to rent out a room
	
A young unmarried couple who had hired a woman to act as their mother, had rented out a room in Colombo posing off as brother and sister.
It was boarding place where accommodation was provided for students who read for higher education. The 'acting' mother who met the landlady said that her children were eligible to enter a higher education institute. and requested a room displaying her love towards the children. She was satisfied with one room.
As the land lady was not able to reject the request made by her, she arranged to share the room with the sister and another girl who was already there and a separate room was given to their brother.
With the passage of one week or two, the girl in the room observed the suspicious behaviour of the sister and brother. She understood that they were not siblings.
Later she understood that their addresses were different and the so called younger sister was older than the brother as well. Although she informed about this to the land lady, she had said that the rent was more important to her.(Pushpakumara Mallawaarachchi)

Britains Defence Secretary threatens  Theresa May
	
UK, (Daily Mail), 23 June 2018 -Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson has threatened to sweep Theresa May from power in a bitter Cabinet row over military cuts.
Furious Mr Williamson warned the Prime Minister that if she did not commit an extra 20 billion to the Ministry of Defence then Tory MPs would vote down the next Budget  effectively passing a motion of no confidence in her.
I made her  and I can break her, Mr Williamson is said to have boasted to service chiefs. 
The furore, described by one Williamson ally as a dogfight at the heart of Government, erupted after Mrs May announced a 20 billion-a-year boost to NHS spending last week. 
Chancellor Philip Hammond then declared there was no money left for similar boosts to defence, housing or schools spending. When Mr Williamson said he needed his own 20 billion  a minimum of 2 billion a year extra for the next decade  to avoid damaging defence cuts, Mrs May questioned whether the UK had to be a tier one military power.

British Council and Ministry of Education collaborate to develop international learning
	
James Dauris, British High Commissioner to Sri Lanka
This year celebrated the last year of the International School Awards in Sri Lanka and the occasion was marked by the presence of Sunil Hettiarachchi, Secretary to the Ministry of Education and James Dauris, British High Commissioner. 170 school principals and 340 teachers from government schools covering all parts of the country celebrated the occasion with special recognition being made of the many British Council Schools Ambassadors.
Over the last 13 years, British Council and Ministry of Education have been working together to promote the adoption by schools of international learning and collaboration. The British Council International School Award (ISA) is an accreditation scheme that recognises and celebrates exemplary practices of internationalism in schools. Taking place in 54 countries, the International School Award encourages schools to collaborate and innovate with overseas schools to create an enriching learning experience for students through the use of information technology, creative informative practices and a practical context for learning.The International School Award raises the profile of schools internationally.
The International School Award is part of Connecting Classrooms, the British Councils global education programme for schools, supported by UK Aid. It is designed to help young people become globally aware and globally competitive in the 21st century. It aims to build the capacity of teachers and principals to support them in integrating a range of core skills (21st century skills) into their teaching and learning, such as critical thinking and problem solving, creativity and imagination, digital literacy, citizenship, student leadership, as well as collaboration and communication.
Gill Caldicott, Country Director of British Council Sri Lanka
Schools that participate in ISA begin by drafting an action plan for an academic year with a minimum of seven projects related tointernational dimensions covering a range of subject areas and age groups. The schools record their work and present a dossier of evidence that is assessed by a panel. Schools that are successful in meeting the assessment criteria are awarded the accreditation for a period of three years.
Gill Caldicott, Country Director of British Council Sri Lanka, commented:I am proud to say that by 2016 in Sri Lanka 500 schools had received the ISA with a further 101 receiving the award in 2016-2017. By the end of this month June 2018, we are expecting another 70 schools to receive the award. This is an excellent indication of the value schools are putting on internationalism and collaborative participation.I would like to thank in particular the contribution of the Ministry of Education, Provincial Departments of Education, all of the British Council School Ambassadors, as well as the Principals, teachers and students who have made this programme such a success.
During the last three years of the programme, 32 grants were awarded for professional school partnerships, 1660 teacher were trained as part of the professional development strand and 384 school leaders received leadership training. In addition, the programme delivered many benefits for students and teachers alike. It helped design, develop and implement international activities in schools, which develop global awareness in both teachers and students across a range of subjects. It also optimised their opportunities for networking, while the award itself gave a sense of recognition to the schools.While the Awards will no longer be offered, an advantage of being a part of British Councils Schools Offer is the accessibility and connectivity provided by the British Councils Schools Online website (schoolsonline.britishcouncil.org). This portalwill continue to provide opportunities for teachers in Sri Lanka to collaborate with partner schools of other countries in a direct and engaging manner.
Louise Cowcher, Director Education, British Council Sri Lanka
While the International School Awards will no longer feature in British Councils schools work in Sri Lanka, the commitment of British Council to work in the field of education will continue. As outlined by Louise Cowcher, Director Education, British Council Sri Lanka: We are supporting the Government of Sri Lankas education reform initiatives through our TRANSFORM programme which will support access for young people to a fit-for-purpose and relevant quality education system, allowing them to reach their potential as well as contribute to Sri Lankas economic and social development.
TRANSFORM operates across schools, higher education and skills, including on areas such as continuous professionalisation of teachers and leaders, professional standards, quality assurance and assessment. We are delighted to be working so closely with colleagues across different ministries and departments and for the UK, through British Council, to be a strategic partner for the Government of Sri Lanka in achieving its objectives of providing an internationally benchmarked quality education for all young people in Sri Lanka.

Dress change to suit new status
	

How a sarong-wearing lorry driver of a department coming under the purview of a certain Ministry had transformed into a tie-coat wearing executive of the same department overnight has become a hot topic in gossip sessions in public service circles these days, they say.

This one-time lorry driver had the good fortune to get this sudden upswing in his status soon after his brother-in-law was appointed the purohita in charge of the Ministry.
The new purohita, a large-hearted man, had considered that that his wifes brother had served long enough as a lorry driver and had him raised to the position of Marketing Promotion officer in the same department. So, that worthy had to change his dress from sarong to coat and tie to suit his new status.

## Title: DRUG DEPENDENCE   A MAJOR SOCIO-ECONOMIC PROBLEM
## Section: Opinion

DRUG DEPENDENCE   A MAJOR SOCIO-ECONOMIC PROBLEM
	

The most common reason is to get high
	
	Only a small percentage of people who experiment with drugs become drug abusers
	
	Intravenous drug addicts are more prone to get infections
	
	There are nearly 25 rehabilitation centres inSri Lanka

Drug dependence is a state characterized by an overpowering desire or need to continue taking a drug and to obtain it by any means. It is sometimes accompanied by physical dependence and the resulting state is detrimental not only to him, but also to the society. 
The morbidity from drug abuse can be due to direct physical or mental pharmacological effects, consequences of the methods used, and the effects of dependence and abstinence. 
Those addicted to drugs have a compulsion to take the drug on a continuous or periodic basis to experience its psychic effects (psychic dependence) and sometimes to avoid the discomfort of its absence (physical dependence). 
There are many addictive or dependence producing drugs. They include, 

Alcohol and barbiturate type drugs 
	
	Amphetamine, methamphetamine (Ecstasy) and anti-obesity drugs 
	
	Cannabis 
	
	Cocaine 
	
	Hallucinogens (LSD, certain mushrooms) 
	
	Khat type (from the plant Catha edulis) 
	
	Opiates (heroin) 
	
	Volatile solvents 
	
	Benzodiazepines, methaqualone and similar drugs 
	
	New psychoactive substances 
	
	Tobacco products

Substances can be taken into the body in several ways. Oral ingestion (swallowing), inhalation (breathing in) or smoking, injection into the veins (shooting up) , and depositing onto the mucosa (moist skin) of the mouth or nose (snorting) are the methods used by drug addicts. 
People abuse drugs for a number of different reasons. 
The most common reason is to get high. Adolescents can become involved in experimentation with drugs. Fortunately, only a small percentage of people who experiment with drugs become drug abusers. The desire to get high can be for many reasons. Pressures of coping with school, work, or family tensions and underlying disease such as depression can lead to addiction. 
It is estimated that Sri Lanka has about 200,000 cannabis addicts and 50,000 heroin addicts. 
Can a person addicted to drugs rehabilitated Yes, but it is difficult. 
There are nearly 25 centres for rehabilitation of addicts in Sri Lanka. Five are government owned. Others are run by various private organizations. 
Residential treatment is much more effective to get an addict out ofdrugs habits. 
The support of the family is essential for the recovery of an addicted person. 
Cannabis is the only drug that grows in Sri Lanka. It is grown illicitly, mostly in the dry zones of the country (in the Eastern and Southern provinces). The estimated land area under cannabis cultivation is nearly 500 hectares. 

Residential treatment is much more effective to get an addict out of drugs habits

Cannabis without the narcotic content is used in the manufacture of Ayurveda (indigenous)medical preparations.
Cannabis causes euphoria, high feeling, pleasurable state of relaxation, enhancement of sensory experiences, increased appetite, impaired performance, sleepiness, confusion and hallucinations. 
Opiates derived from the plant Papaver somniferum or poppy plant, have many alkaloids including morphine. Heroin is a substance synthesized from morphine. Opium is used in the Ayurveda (indigenous) medical pharmacopeia and the government makes it available to Ayurveda Medical Practitioners through Government Hospitals. 
Among the heroin users in Sri Lanka, inhalation (chase the dragon) is the preferred mode of administration. This is much less harmful than intravenous injection. Intravenous drug addicts are more prone to get infections. Diazepam, lactose, sucrose, acetaminophen and caffeine are the commonly used adulterants of heroin. 
Heroin causes a sense of wellbeing, euphoria, contentment, detachment from emotional/physical distress and pain relief. It can cause drowsiness, lack of concentration, respiratory depression and even death. 
Addiction to heroin causes serious withdrawal symptoms when heroin is not present in blood. Addicts experience anxiety, restlessness, sweating, yawning, runny nose, watering of the eyes, diarrhoea, incontinence of urine, abdominalpains and delusions.
Heroin users die prematurely from acute heroin overdose, inhalation of vomit, acute ulcerative endocarditis, bronchopneumonia and hepatitis. They are more likely meet with accidents and commit suicide. 
Amphetamines have medical uses for attention deficit disorders, narcolepsy and appetite suppressant (slimming pills). Its abuse can cause feeling of wellbeing, euphoria, increased alertness and energy, increased heart rate and blood pressure and bizarre, erratic and violent behaviour. 3,4-methylene -
dioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), also known as Ecstasy or Disco drug, increases all pleasurable sensations. Users have feeling of emotional closeness, increased physical and emotional energy, restlessness, anxiety and hallucinations. 
Its serious health effects are increased heart rate and blood pressure, brain damage and liver damage. Ecstasy is popular among participants of discos in night clubs and users have died suddenly in night clubs. 
Heroins synthetic cousin, Fentanyl, is one of the deadliest drugs in the world. 
Dealers are lacing cocaine and heroin with fentanyl, and young adults are dying in significant numbers. While there has been a downward trend in deaths from prescription opioids alone, overdose deaths from fentanyl have risen dramatically, up 540 percent in three years. 
Fentanyl is a synthetic opioid painkiller, prescribed to treat severe pain. It is a cousin to heroin, but much deadlier because it is much stronger50 times more potent than heroin. Fentanyl owes its potency over heroin to differences in chemical structure. Both chemicals bind to the mu opioid receptor in the brain. But fentanyl gets there faster than heroin because it more easily passes through the fat in the brain. It also grabs onto the receptor so tightly that it does not take much to trigger the opioid effects in the body. 
As fentanyl is a fine powder, it is easy to mix into other drugs. It looks identical to heroin, so users, injecting heroin laced with fentanyl, do not know theyre injecting a lethal dose until it is too late.

Drug abuse is common among poor families, while a drug abuser in a family makes them poorer.

The impact of drug abuse on the individual, his family and on the society is very significant. The family and the community can be the origin of drug problems, but they can also be a potent force for treatment. The disrupted family life can lead to drug problems, while drug problems can lead to disruption of family life. 
Drug abuse is common among poor families, while a drug abuser in a family makes them poorer. Drug abuse impairs family life, results in unproductive employment and reduces the quality of life. Impaired performance at work can lead to poor productivity and reduced income. Absence from work and intoxication at work can lead to disciplinary problems, accidents at work and excess medical claims 
It is very unfortunate that young drug addicts face premature death. 
The cost to the health services and the economy of the country as a result of drug dependence can be significant. 
While illicit cultivation, production, distribution and possession of drugs are crimes, drug abusers commit crimes for money and after influence of drugs. Drug trade is involved with money laundering. Drug trafficking leads to all types of crime, violence and gun use, as seen in Sri Lanka. Monetary costs from theft and other crimes by abusers to support their drug habits, and money spent for law enforcement agencies and the judiciary can be significant. 
Many recommendations are made to prevent and treat drug abuse. Return to old family values in the society is one. There should be adjustment to accept the return of a family member who was a drug abuser. Families counselling for change, informing and educating parents and support and strengthen religious values are also recommended. 
As Kofi Annan, a former UN Secretary-General said, Illicit drugs destroy innumerable individual lives and undermine our societies. Confronting the illicit trade in drugs and its effects remains a major challenge for theinternational community.

Havelock Sports Club President Romesh Abeywickrema shares Yusoofs enthusiasm and vision for the future to take Sri Lankan rugby  and sports in general  to the next level.
At Havies, we always strive to improve our game while also improving rugby standards in Sri Lanka. Partnering with EFL, I feel, is definitely a step in the right direction, and will strengthen us further in our drive to become one of the best teams in the region, he said.
Sammy Akbar  Directorof3PL & Freeport at EFL, Gazzali Arifeen  Director of Air Freight at EFL, Jagath Pathirane  Director/ CEO of EFL, Saif Yusoof  Managing Director at EFL, Romesh Abeywickrema  President of Havelock Sports Club, Thusitha Peiris  Treasurer at Havelock Sports Club and Tiny Samat  General Secretary at Havelock Sports Club.
Yusoof further said that the company wishes for its international clients to experience Sri Lankan culture as well as Havelock Sports Clubs rich history as a result of the sponsorship.
The Havelock Sports Club dates back well over a century. Formed in 1915, the original Havies comprised 27 school boys from 12 to 16 years of age  all of whom resided in the vicinity of the Havelock Park. Together the boys formed a club and named it Havelock Sports Club, and the rest, as they say, is history.
Our presence in Sri Lankan rugby  and sport in general  is deeply rooted in Colombos colourful past, and the experience we have gathered over the past century as a club will no doubt prove to be a great asset for EFL in their plans to further develop the game, said Romesh
Pioneering clubs like Havelocks that has existed for 103 years need corporate support to survive in a highly competitive professional environment, and the corporate community must focus on sustaining popular sports as part of their social responsibility which ultimately brings out the best in our youth and also fosters the future generation of this country through sport, addedSammy Akbar, Director of 3PL and Freeport, EFL.

Govt. to curb underworld activities: Ruwan
	
The government has decided to curb underworld activities with the assistance of the tri-forces, State Minister of Defense Ruwan Wijewardene said yesterday.
He said the decision was taken at the Defence Council meeting chaired by President Maithripala Sirisena and assured that underworld activities that has raised its ugly head would be rooted out for the people to live peacefully.
According to him, a large sum of money had been spent for national security and that would be given continuously.
He said so yesterday addressing the media after observing the place where the proposed standing Buddha statue is to be established opposite the Wivekarama temple in Kanduboda, Delgoda.

## Title: If Gota heeds to the sermon and  becomes a Hitler

If Gota heeds to the sermon and  becomes a Hitler  
	
Mr. Gotabaya Rajapaksa has skeletons though, may not be in his closet, but wherever white vans had dumped victims during his abduction prone tenure as the Defence Secretary. But, not even by a long shot did he go any close to Hitler. Last week, when a high priest publicly urged him to become a Hitler, it was not clear whether the aspiring presidential candidate took it as a compliment or as a personal affront. The Anunayake of the Asgiriya Chapter, Ven Vedaruvey Upali Thera has reportedly told Mr. Rajapaksa: if they call you Hitler, even become a Hitler and establish the military rule and develop the country. Those were unusual birthday blessings reportedly delivered at an alms-giving to mark the 69th birthday of Mr. Rajapaksa.
These remarks smack of a new low of many things; of the political culture and religious elites who claim to have a historic duty to advise the political leadership. Those are hallmarks of insularity and ignorance not just of one gory episode of human history. That ignorance, in fact, has deep roots in South Asia, and the Middle East: Anagarika Dharmapala himself wrote to Hitler, but never received a reply. Hordes of Indians venerate Subhash Chandra Bose, who fought as an accessory of the Japanese imperial army, one of the most brutal forces that ever walked on this part of world since Genghis Khan.

Gotabayas military rule is more likely to resemble kleptocratic and out of touch Burmese Junta or Sanee Abacha of Nigeria, than anything remotely akin to Ataturk or Ching kai-shek

This ignorance has been repackaged as patriotism and is being sold to the public. There is a regular stream of buyers.
But, flaunting despotism runs not just against any religious teaching, but also against our earthly basic human values of decency, which have to be defended if a civilized form of government is ever to function. Hitler is remotely the candidate for a civilized government. Nor would his reincarnation do any better.
This flimsy notion that circumventing democratic norms would lead to development is bunkum. White vans do not bring in investors. The era of authoritarian development is long gone, except in the countries that are still rising from an extremely low economic base such as Rwanda (where a past trauma of a genocide may warrant certain measures).
A closer look at the recent history of political economy would reveal, except a few, majority of authoritarian states, military dictatorships and theocracies failed in creating prosperity for their own people. The few that succeeded - Taiwan, South Korea, Chile, and Shahs Iran etc., shared certain characteristics: They were right leaning, pro-market, largely secular and pro-American, which pumped investment, advisors and technological transfer. That is obviously not an arrangement that Mr. Rajapaksa and his acolytes, who feel intimidated by free trade agreements and foreign expertise, want to have. Only other successful authoritarian development state, Communist China thrives not chiefly in the unchecked coercive force, but also in a centuries-old Confucius social and cultural dynamic which has been harnessed and moulded by the party state.

Flaunting despotism runs not just against any religious teaching, but also against our earthly basic human values of decency, which have to be defended if a civilized form of government is ever to function

Even for those who have a soft corner for pro-growth development, what should worry is that given the personal dispensation of people around him, Gotabayas military rule is more likely to resemble kleptocratic and out of touch Burmese Junta or Sanee Abacha of Nigeria, than anything remotely akin to Ataturk or Ching kai-shek.
This disturbing tendency to flaunt despotism as a panacea for real and perceived failings of democracy is also universal. Strongmen and conmen who exploited public anxieties have often exaggerated those shortcomings and ridden to power promising to address them; and once in positions of political power, they have calculatedly dismantled the same democratic systems and independent institutions. The danger is much higher when the despot himself morphed into a populist, such as in Turkeywhere authoritarian President Erdogan won a second term of an all-powerful presidency this week.
Sri Lanka itself is witnessing a growing antipathy towards new found freedoms, and deliberate efforts to overstate existing problems, be it crimes, cost of living or a new scheming to concoct a narrative of the revival of the LTTE.
This is the first phase of delegitimizing the democratic system. These claims are freely aired due to the relative freedom, not so long ago such a bravado would have warranted a white van ride. Also, those hyperbolic and polarized assertions are a manifestation of misplaced pathways of political empowerment in this country. Whether it was the British who gave universal suffrage before people had access to proper toilets, or S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike who opened floodgates , chiefly responsible for this aberration needs further dispassionate soul searching.
The second phase of this strategy is to present the would be despot as the catalyst of change, which Mr. Rajapaksas associates in Viyathmaga and other groups are doing.
Third, if elected to power by some luck, the true colours of dehami nayakaya (Dharmista ruler) would be in full show: The 18th Amendment would be given away, independent institutions would be dismantled. Regime legitimization would be achieved through sermons by likeminded monks and Rupavahini propaganda. Dissent would be labelled as traitors.
At the last stage, it would be too late and risky to speak out because by then, it would be hard to find a judge dare enough to hear a habeas corpus.

Regime legitimization would be achieved through sermons by likeminded monks and Rupavahini propaganda. Dissent would be labelled as traitors

All the above can happen in a democracy, or a flawed democracy, not just because its detractors are exemplary manipulators of public grievances. But because, its governments are reactive, indecisive and incapable of independent decision making. This government is a case in point. In our part of the world, no government can survive in power unless it exerts a good deal of its autonomy over society. That may not be the classic democratic thing to do.
But, the difference between a despotic rule and democracy lies in the means it uses to achieve this end: whether it is white vans or powers vested with it by the Constitution.
When a government hesitates to use its constitutional powers, and to do so proactively and efficiently to make room for highways, industrial zones and combat crimes, its detractors tell the public a Hitler and a military rule would make all their dreams come true.
These statements themselves are a threat to social and political fabric, and in a functional and authoritative system, such calls for a military rule is tantamount to sedition and the laws of the State should take its course.
When a government fails to take action to address grassroots grievances and play blind to sinister efforts to manipulate them, it effectively delegitimize the democratic system. Then a Hitler could well become a reality.

More than a doctor
	
Dr. Ananda Wijewickrema

Dr Wijewickrema organized a special section of the hospital to facilitate students with dengue across the island to write the exam
	
	Dr Ananda Wijewickrema, a ray of hope to patients sitting for GCE OLevels

Dr. Ananda Wijewickrema, Senior Consultant Physician, Head of the IDH Hospital and Specialist for Dengue, is a gentleman who takes his profession beyond the call of duty.
His research in the treatment of Dengue has won him many accolades, but what is outstanding is his management of patients back to normalcy and his passion to return them to their original standard of living at the earliest.
The ideal example is the opportunity he afforded his young patients waiting to sit for the GCE Ordinary Level examination last December.
The vulnerability and the emotional upheaval of patients, parents and caregivers were considered a priority by Dr Wijewickrema and his staff, who nurtured all according to the need of the hour.
In addition, Dr Wijewickrema organized a special section of the hospital in compliance with the Director of the Department of Examinations to facilitate a temporary centre for some of the dengue patients from schools across the island, with different curriculum to sit their GCE OL examination.
His sheer determination that these patients should not forego their year-long hard work in preparing for the exam was assisted with wheelchairs and the drip to complete the exam, regardless of the circumstances they encountered. Even patients under treatment at the peak of fever were given the assurance and the support, to complete the examinations.

The confidence exuded by Dr Wijewickrema gave additional confidence that the young patients required to face the examination under most difficult circumstances. It is noteworthy to mention that this kind, thoughtful doctor has given this opportunity to patients for the past three years

Parents of patients diagnosed with the bleeding type of dengue were given the reassurance, encouragement and all medical assistance to accept the challenge and complete the examination. The confidence exuded by Dr Wijewickrema gave the additional confidence that the young patients required to face the examination under most difficult circumstances. It is noteworthy to mention that this kind, thoughtful doctor has given this opportunity to patients for the past three years.
In todays world, we so often hear about the negatives of the medical system. Well, not this time. Thanks to the compassion and dedication of Dr Ananda Wijewickrema and the medical staff of the Dengue Unit of the IDH Hospital, whose exceptional services are invaluable to our nation, it can be boldly stated that lead by example is the most effective method of professionalism.

Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa would not have any difficulty to get former Sri Lankan Ambassador to Russia UdayangaWeeratunga, who was alleged to have involved in MiG deal,to return to Sri Lanka, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said today.
Hitlers brother would not have any difficulty in bringingback Weeratunga to Sri Lanka as he is still associated with the latter, PM Wickremesinghe told UNP Ministersat Temple Trees today.
He had referred to former President as Hitlers brother. The Sri Lankan Government had made arrangements to bring Mr Weeratunga back to the country with the help of the Interpol, even if former President did not ask him to come back to Sri Lanka, Mr Wickremesinghe had said.
The Prime Minister had expressed these sentiments, while chatting with the Ministers after the official meeting.
The Ministers have brought the Prime Ministers focus on the statement made by former President that Prime Minster should bring former Central Bank Governor Arjuna Mahendran back to the country.
The Prime Minister had told the Ministers that he couldnt bring Mr Mahendran back as he had not associated with the latter, ever since he left the Governor Post of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka.
I cannot bring Mr Mahendran back even if Mr. Rajapaksa could bring Mr Weeratunga back to the country. Mr Rajapaksa could bring Mr Weeratunga back to the country as he associated with the latter continuously, the Prime Minister had said.
The Prime Minister had also told the Ministers that he was not prepared to associate with those against whom arrest warrants had been issued. (Yohan Perera)

Psychology or demonology
	
Jayantha Chandrasiri likes to talk, I have always noticed. And how. He can explain and rationalise something that appears to be so portentous and heavy that once he stops talking you are left telling yourself, Damn, why didnt I think of that before
At times, though, he can get mysterious, offering explanations for something none of which makes sense or holds the key to the truth.
This latter personality comes up when his films are concerned. Thats natural, and to be welcomed. Directors love revealing threads from the plots of their work and Chandrasiri, being an exception, likes to tackle the eager journalist, writer, or spectator by giving him clues as to what those plots hold.
That, plus the sense of mysticism packed into his films, helps explain why they are so intriguing and why only a very narrow section of the critical fraternity has done justice to them.
This is a review of his latest film, Garasarapa, which I feel deserves full treatment by a worthier critic elsewhere and which, over here, needs to be prefaced by a few thoughts on a director everyone loves to get confused over.
From his first teledrama, Wedahamine, to his most recently screened film, Samanala Sandwaniya, Jayantha is one of the few visual artistes from here whose body of work Ive watched, re-watched, and pondered over seriously.
What I think about them has a bearing on what I think about Garasarapa, because in more ways than one Garasarapa is to Chandrasiri what, say, Hail Caesar is to the Coen Brothers: it is an inevitable consequence of everything which preceded and prepared us for it. This is true when it comes to his most discernible motif: The intersection of magic and reality, and in the context of our history. Supplanted by romances that never run counter to that motif, it is coloured by dichotomies, which both pit the past against the present and bring them together: Village versus city (Wedahamine), old versus young (Dandubasnamanaya), man versus woman (Akala Sandya).
He was, and is, at his best when he is dwelling on a theme no one without even a smattering of Sri Lankan history can understand. That history is Sinhalese and Buddhist, but it is never exclusionist. That his best work ran parallel with the rise of a middle-class Sinhala Buddhist Consciousness, which in turn ran parallel with the rise of an urban nationalist political movement (Think of the Sinhala Urumaya and its successor, the Hela Urumaya), is not, I believe, a coincidence.
When Gamini Akmeemana, in his review, castigated what he felt to be the middle-class nationalist outlook of Agnidahaya, Jayanthas first film, he was contending that it entailed nostalgia for the mythical and the pastoral.
In a reply penned just days after the review was published, Malinda Seneviratne, in his own inimitable way, suggested that the people of the 21st century arent as rationalistic as Gamini implied them to be, and that the mythical and the magical in Agnidahaya wasnt as superfluous or unnecessary as rational critics described them as being.
Heres the problem with taking a rational stand on the movies in societies like ours: Once you bring in the concept of cultural identity and heritage, you are bound to alienate a broad section of the population, which has never really understood the workings of that culture.

Much of Jayanthas forays into our history revolve around the 16th and 17th centuries...a dichotomy between the reality of colonialism and reality of cultural presence

I dont think this is a problem with the director. It is a problem with the critic. Agnidahaya, being Jayanthas first, was slightly overdrawn. Technically and formally, it didnt stand out: the intersection of love and hatred (the tagline, lets not forget, was Vairaya aadarayata vada ganakamai) between Kamal Addaraarachchi and Jackson Anthony over Yashoda Wimaladharma wasnt properly sketched out, to mention just one defect.
But most of the critics, particularly from the cosmopolitan, liberal English press, seemed to ignore that.
The Sunday Timess R. Wickramasinghe, to give just one example, in a review tellingly titled Step out of history suggested that it was wrong of Jayantha to concentrate his entire plot on the year 1664. Forgetting, of course, that much of Jayanthas forays into our history revolve around the 16th and 17th centuries, near-perfect centuries to delve into considering that they entailed a dichotomy between the reality of colonialism on the one hand and the reality of our cultural presence in the rural hinterlands on the other.
I think the mistake made by the English critic when he or she tries to assess films like Agnidahaya or television serials like Akala Sandya is the confusion that is sustained between magic and reality.
As scholars much more experienced in the field than me will tell you, hundreds of years ago what is considered magic today was treated as a living, breathing reality. And not just in societies like ours.

I cant tell or ascertain whether Jayantha came to terms with this dilemma ..... but what I and what we do know is that it took a good eight years for him to return to the movies, and when he did return, he made the most atypical work he has ever given

Even in the West, the concept of magic evolved out of a desire to explain what couldnt be explained, to rationalise what couldnt be rationalised.
There was hence nothing erratic in Jayantha resorting to the supernatural. Everything -and practically every last detail- has been so well researched that he leaves no room for arbitrary effects. As Akala Sandya, which in this respect is his most supernatural work, illustrates, the concept of reading and communicating between minds and the power of yogic meditation (lets not forget time travel) had a definite historical foundation during the reign of Rajasinghe the Second, who ruled at a time when there was an interest in the martial arts (Angampora) and swordsmanship and all the resultant clashes between clans vying for power.
Guerrilla Marketing in that sense was a departure of sorts, though not completely, from what he had been leading up to. This, the most theatrical of all his films (it owes as much to our folk cultural forms, particularly with Premasiri Khemadasas music, as it does to the theatre of Beckett and Brecht), also brought to light a basic problem in Jayanthas universe. I still think Guerrilla Marketing is his best work, and not because I have a penchant towards seeing popular political figures from yesteryear being parodied and rather well at that. (I am, of course, talking about Jackson Anthonys performance, one of the best performances Ive seen in a Sri Lankan film.)
I also think that his primary fascination - the rift between what can be explained and what cannot be, or between the mythical and the real - found its way to the directors depiction of that most contemporary of magical devices, advertising. (Guerrilla Marketing is a cheap, crude advertising tactic, and the last scene, of our protagonist returning home along a road that has huge cut-outs of the man he marketed, is an indictment on the monsters he has released through his own cheap, crude deception.)
It also has some of the best performances that a Jayantha Chandrasiri cast (Kamal, Yashoda, Sriyantha, and of course Jackson, not to mention Sangeetha Weeraratne) could ever have had.
But nevertheless, there was a basic problem. That problem had nothing to do with its plot or themes or cast or even technique. It had to do with the clash which came out between the cultural imperatives of the work and the melodramatic love triangle the work depicted.


Guerrilla Marketing is his best work, and not because I have a penchant towards seeing popular political figures from yesteryear

Deborah Youngs review of Guerrilla Marketing in Variety is at times off the mark because it fails to account for the richness in Jayanthas madness (when she indicts those innovative dance numbers that jump out of nowhere, she is both paying a compliment to Channa Wijewardenas choreography and devaluing a key component of the plot, because without those dance numbers, we would not get a sense of proportion, a foundation, through which we can make sense of the link between Gregory Muhandirams rabid aversion to culture and his idealisation of mass deception), but where she is correct is where she takes to task what she sees (A little wrongly) as a silly, star-crossed love triangle between Thisara (Kamal), his wife Rangi (Sangeetha), and his former lover, who happens to be working at the same ad agency that Rangi and Thisara are, Suramya (Yashoda).
Here, for the first time, we saw a dichotomy arise between two facets Jayantha had brought together before.
I cant tell or ascertain whether Jayantha came to terms with this dilemma (several reviews, both local and foreign, pointed it out), but what I and what we do know is that it took a good eight years for him to return to the movies, and when he did return, he made the most atypical work he has ever given.
Samanala Sandwaniya is Jayantha Chandrasiri through and through (not least because it has Yashoda as the main actress, and because it induces nostalgia for the past, particularly considering the reference to Gamperaliya through the names of its protagonists), but as Sumitra Peries, who loved it, once told me: It is Catholic in the sense that it is universal.
And so it is. Unlike the patently indigene qualities of his previous work, Samanala Sandwaniya is a film for everyoneand anyone.
It was a retreat, and a great one at that (though here too, in the form of two buffoonish Laurel-and-Hardy-like jokers who cause a debacle at the park after mocking Yashoda, Jayantha steps out of line thanks to his theatrical past), and without any overt reference to the mythical and the pastoral, it could be rationalised by both the liberal and the traditionalist.
Maharaja Gemunu, which followed it, is a film I have unfortunately not seen even now. But what these two works necessitated was a return to Jayanthas previous oeuvre. Whether Garasarapa resolved the fatal contradiction which Guerrilla Marketing unearthed, whether he finally managed to bring together the historical currents of his plots and the romantic triangle in them, however, are questions I must answer when I delve into my review in my next piece.

PTSD AND WOUNDS OF THE WAR MAY STILL NOT BE HEALED
	
Mob-style leopard killing in Kilinochchi:

Kilinochchipeople ...havebeen living with fear, anger and hatred for years
	
	PTSD maydevelop after an exposure to anevent or ordeal...
	
	Violentpersonalassaults, naturalor unnaturaldisasters,accidents or militarycombat maytrigger PTSD
	
	PTSD(Which was experiencedduring the aftermathof the ethnic conflict) is newto Sri Lankans

Last week, all Sri Lankans witnessed the power of a mob. The entire country watched in agony as a leopard was beaten to death by a mob in Ambalnagar, Kilinochchi. The footage went viral on social media, once again raising eyebrows among authorities and wildlife enthusiasts. While many people questioned the law, the authorities, the failure to implement actions based on the ordinances, a few others analyzed it a little differently.

Kilinochchi, an area that was devastated by the war is home to people victimized by the conflict, who have been living with fear, anger and hatred for years. As such accumulated symptoms of untreated Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), was quite visible in the footage as the mob not only killed the leopard but clicked selfies and rejoiced over the carcass.
While weeping about the fact that the countrys leopard population is already under threat, the authorities also need to worry about the prevailing mindset of the war-affected victims, nine years into the post-war era.


Post-traumaticstress disorder
Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is a trauma and stress-related disorder that may develop after an exposure to an event or ordeal in which death, severe physical harm or violence occurred or was threatened.
Traumatic events that may trigger PTSD include violent personal assaults, natural or unnatural disasters, accidents or military combat. PTSD was quite a new psychological condition to Sri Lankans which was experienced during the aftermath of the ethnic conflict.During the final stages of the war, the crossfire was intense and losing life and limb became the order of the day.
With economic hardships, no shelter and loss of loved ones, people were vulnerable or were already undergoing all sorts of physical and mental trauma. While some were separated from families, others were forcibly asked to join the rebel groups.
Poverty and lack of education remained to be deterrents, which after many years, are still visible in the Northern part of the country.
Except for certain non-profit organizations, the government didnt have as many programmes to rehabilitate the people affected by the war. However, it was a known fact that detention camps were setup in various parts of the country and ex-LTTE cadres and victims of the war were alleged to be severely punished, while leaving them in unpleasant environments.
Although there are several success stories of reintegrating victims of the war back into society, the recent video is proof that a lot more needs to be done in terms of healing the wounds of the war.

2017 Ramon Magsaysay Award winner Gethsie Shanmugam was recognized for her work in rebuilding lives from psycho-social wounds of war and violence.
Her focus was mainly on war widows and children in the North but she experienced the effects of violence on both genders.

" It is the basicfeeling of lovethat will change people "

Speaking to the Daily mirror ,Gethsie said that after a war this kind of a spillover among victims, war widows and orphaned children was common in any part of the world.
We are helping people to touch the Earth. We have to educate the teachers. It is a case of refining their attitudes. The country has it but we need to search for the positive drops, collectively. Abuse will come out in different ways, according to the level of pain that is coming out. We are not helping our people to become self-aware to use their talents and be creative. It took one or two years to reap benefits of this programme we did after the war. It was based on the healing of memories.
Sri Lanka is in the best position where relationships are valued. So we have to take all those as positives in this circumstance. We need to build on the positive stones. My focus was women who have lost their husbands but men in the periphery were giving trouble. The women would sleep in small corners of the camp and the men would come and peep. Hence it was quite an unsafe environment. It wasnt easy to handle the men. Sexual abuse and related incidents happened in broad daylight.


In an interview she did at the time she received her award, Gethsie pointed out that the working with women and children in spite of war and trauma wasnt easy.
It was easy to go through the youth.
These people still havent gotten into that memory level. When we were working the bleeding stopped, but the scars had appeared. We were trying to heal their memories. Memories wont die and its very difficult. Its the basic love that will change people who are trying to fight with each other.
Anger and hatred are two feelings which are strong in this kind of setup. With that, there are other feelings such as jealousy and selfishness that come banging into people. So the main thing to start with is the understanding of your own feelings. As counsellors, it is important to be with them. You dont really have to talk. Relationships are worn and now we are quarrelling.

Airing his views to the Daily mirror , Environmental Lawyer and wildlife enthusiast Jagath Gunawardena said that this was the first time such a perverse incident took place.
The killing of a leopard is an offence under the Fauna and Flora Protection Ordinance (FFPO) under Section 30 since it is a strictly protected species. Therefore nobody is allowed to kill, harm or keep body parts of the species. So, offenders could be apprehended without a warrant.

The first time such a perverse incident took place

It is a non-bailable offence. They can also be charged under the Cruelty to Animals Ordinance since they have violated it. Therefore they should be charged under both the above-mentioned Ordinances.
At the onset of the incident, the Kilinochchi Magistrates Court issued a warrant to identify the culprits.
So far, four suspects have been arrested. A 42-year-old resident from Ambalkulam and a 39-year old from Udayanagar surrendered to the Police on Sunday and were remanded till June 29.


In his comments to the Daily mirror ,Department of Wildlife Conservation Director General M.G.C Sooriyabandara said that the fine is Rs. 100,000 with five years of Rigorous Imprisonment.
We are making use of the footage released on social media to identify the rest of the culprits. The way the people responded was wrong. They cant take the law into their hands. What they should have done was to inform the DWC officials without killing the animal. Since they have obstructed the activities carried out by the officials they would be charged for that as well, he said.

We are ready to accept any MP who would leave the Government, National Freedom Front (NFF) Leader and MP Wimal Weerawansa said today.
He expressed these views to the media after concluding a discussion held with the 16 SLFP MPs who left the government recently at NFF Head Office today.
We have negotiated with the 16 SLFP group as to what ways we can strengthen the opposition. We need a strong majority of MPs to the opposition to defeat the 20th amendment to the Constitution and other proposals which are adverse to the future of the country, Weerawansa said.
We are open to any MP who wishes to join us in the move to weaken the coalition government. We have observed that we are already having the required amount of MPs to form the majority in Parliament. But if anybody wishes to join us, he is mostly welcome, Weerawansa said.
Meanwhile, he said they were also working to make former President Mahinda Rajapaksa as the Leader of the Opposition. (Sheain Fernandopulle)

SriLankan hoping to reduce excess staff
	
The government is considering retrenching the excess staff of SriLankan airlines by measures such as Voluntary Retirement Schemes, a report says.
The airline will appoint a task force for the implementation of a proposal made by the committee appointed to look into the financial situation of the national career. The airline is estimated to have an excess staff of 2,000 and that some 1,000 employees are between the ages of 50 and 55.
By March 31, 2018, the national career had incurred a loss of US$107 million. The committee, in its report submitted to Public Enterprise Development Minister Lakshman Kiriella, said the airline is hopeful of reducing the losses and had recommended that legacy liabilities should be removed from the balance sheet as early as possible. Otherwise, it says the interest payable on loans would add up to the total loss incurred by the airline.
As for fleet rationalization, the report says the airline has started negotiations with AIRBUS for the cancellation of the orders placed for four new 350 NEO-300. The company has agreed to eight NEO 320 aircraft instead of the current order. It will be deliverable after 2023.
The committee has also recommended the curtailment of expenditure by 15 per cent for the next financial year. (Kelum Bandara)

There was a move to shift a certain provincial body to a new building and its political chief held a series of staff conferences to work out the shifting arrangements.

These white-collar high-ups, of course, had no any official intimation, but learnt from the parties concerned that an order for snacks to be served at the usual tea party hosted to the participants of the conference had been placed with a catering service of a high-end hotel. Later they found to their surprise that food items ordered for delivery were far in excess of the normal requirement. Several days later, the white-collar ones were surprised to learn that the snacks for the staff conference had been duly delivered and the Ministry involved had paid the bill although the conference was not held!
Those baffled by this mystery learnt that their political chief had held a bash at his official residence to mark his birthday!

The concept of  Pooja  at Thanthirimale
	

Ven. Sangamitta Therani brought with her a sapling of the Sri Maha Bodhi from India on that great Unduwap Poya Day many centuries ago
	
	The Sacred Bodhi at Thanthirimale presently, is the eighth shoot of the original Bodhi that was brought to this country
	
	When a Buddhist religious site is lit up, we consider it as an offering or a Pooja to the Lord Buddha and an outside sign of our veneration

The annual Aloka Pooja by Wijeya Newspapers will take place at Thanthirimale for three days on June 27th, 28th and 29th, with Poson Poya day falling on the 27th.
This annual offering or Pooja continues for the 15th year without a break, bringing devotees to this sacred city in large numbers. To take part in an offering or a Pooja is something that is practised by all religions.
Catholics offer gifts and donations at the Altar during their offertory ceremonies in the Churches. Buddhists do the same to the priests or Lord Buddha at temples and at religious sites.
The concept of offering light or a lamp is widely practised by Buddhists, and so is the concept of Aloka Pooja. Aloka Pooja is not just hanging bulbs and switching them on at a ceremony.
When a Buddhist religious site is lit up, we consider it as an offering or a Pooja to the Lord Buddha and an external sign of our veneration.
It is in this light that we should accept this annual event at Thanthirimale. The management and the staff of Wijeya go to great lengths to conduct this Aloka Pooja annually. This, they have done over the past years successfully.

When a Buddhist religious site is lit up, we consider it as an offering or a Pooja to the Lord Buddha and an external sign of our veneration. The preparation for this annual event starts in earnest a couple of months in advance. ...

The preparation for this annual event starts in earnest a couple of months in advance. This time there was more time since Vesak celebrations were held almost two months ago.
During Poson, we remember the historical events that took place for the establishment of Buddhism in Sri Lanka. We remember the arrival of Ven. Mihindurahathanwahansey to preach the great doctrine to the king and the people, during this time of the year.
We have heard again and again the historical details about this visit and how the Great King Devanam Piyatissa accepted the great doctrine humbly. He took all the means available to see that it was preached to all corners of the island.
Thanthirimale has the added importance of celebrating not only the arrival of Buddhism but also the fact that Ven. Sangamitta Therani brought with her a sapling of the Sri Maha Bodhi, from India on that great Unduwap Poya Day many centuries ago through this humble village. Thanthirimale became famous because of this singular event.
Ven. Sangamitta Therani was the sister of Ven. Mihindu. Thera.
The sacred sapling was kept overnight on its arrival at Thanthirimale before it was taken to Anuradhapura by the King and his royal entourage accompanied by the two venerable siblings. The journey must have been very religious and very colourful as the royal procession meandered along the Malwattu Oya to the main city of Anuradhapura. The Sacred Bodhi that is at Thanthirimale presently, is the eighth shoot of the original Bodhi that was brought to this country.

This was a gift to this humble village by the King for the reception that was accorded to the royalty a couple of years back. It is believed that the sapling was planted at the spot, where the original sapling was kept overnight for veneration
This was a gift to this humble village by the King for the reception that was accorded to the royalty a couple of years back. It is believed that the sapling was planted at the spot, where the original sapling was kept overnight for veneration. The sacred Bodhi at Thanthirimale continues to grow overcoming threats from man, beast and the unpredictable weather in the area.
For centuries the whole area remained unpopulated, being the abode of only wild beasts. The sacred Bodhi had withstood many a storm and invasions from all corners. It continues to flourish and grow.
The Aloka Pooja is held while commemorating these historical events, to pay homage to Lord Buddha and the Sacred Bodhi. It is a sacred occasion and all those who take part in this religious event annually are guided by the very principles that have been bequeathed to us by history. The pilgrimage to Thanthirimale is less troublesome now with improved facilities. The authorities are forever improving these facilities and hopefully, the number of pilgrims will continue to increase in the years to come.

Some employees of a research institute in the agricultural sector were up in arms when they heard that the authorities had decided to send their boss home on retirement.

So, a group of employees both male and female had met the purohita concerned to lodge their protest.
The purohita had explained that their boss was now past his seventies and it was high time to allow him to enjoy his well-earned rest.
At this age, you cant expect him to be quite active and energetic, he had added. Then a young female employee had risen to speak on behalf of the employees. Sir, our boss is quite energetic despite his age. He is physically and mentally strong enough to run our institute! she had maintained. The other male and female employees readily endorsed her view, they say.

## Title: TNA set to split as elections approach

TNA set to split as elections approach
	


The Tamil National Alliance (TNA), of which the Ilankai Tamil ArasuKatchi (ITAK) is the single largest constituent, appears to be heading for a split, with the Sampanthan and Wigneswaran factions failing to find a common ground towork together. 
A likely outcome is the emergence of two new groupings, with the ITAK and its adjuncts being on one side and a conglomerate or congeries of groups headed by the Northern Province Chief Minister C.V. Wigneswaran being on theother side. 
The two factions have been on the verge of a split several times before but have stayed together in an uneasy relationship either because there was no alternative path in sight; or because there was no immediate need to part ways; or because of pressure from an external force which, both sides believed, could not be alienated. 
Just prior to the August 2015 parliamentary elections, there was a move in the TNA to oust Wigneswaran from the Chief Ministerial post because he had declared that he would remain neutral and not campaign for the TNA or any other party. 
When challenged on the grounds that he owed his election and position of Chief Minister to the TNA/ITAK, Wigneswaran declared that people had voted for him as an individual and not as a candidate of the TNA or the ITAK. 
However, because the TNA won the parliamentary elections handsomely, and the dominance of the ITAK and its leader R. Sampanthan continued, the move to oust Wigneswaran was abandoned. 
Nevertheless, trouble in the TNA continued to brew. By June 2017, it had come to a head with Wigneswaran inquiring into the conduct of some of his ministers and asking them to step aside to enable free and fair investigations. This was resented by the Sampanthan group which saw it as nothing but a biased political witch hunt. 

While the Sampanthan faction has been busy with the process of drafting a new SL constitution and taking up Tamil issues in parliament, Wignewaran and his cohorts have kept debunking these efforts as a farce

The TNA hatched a plot to move a No-Confidence Motion against Wigneswaran. However it was thwarted at the eleventh hour due to the intervention of an external force which warned that any split in the TNA or ITAK would mean the end of the elected provincial council, which that force had worked hard to wangle from the Rajapaksa administration in 2013. Eventually, a compromise formula was arrived at and both sides abided by it.
However, fundamental differences between the Wigneswaran and Sampanthan groups continued to exist with Wigneswaran obliquely accusing Sampanthan of having compromised the Tamil cause for the sake of a cushy relationship with the powers-that-be in Colombo, namely, the government as well as the Sinhala majoritarian parties. 
Despite the regular taunts expressed through the media, the Sampanthan group did not retort or react. It continued to stick to its policy of engaging the Sri Lankan Government and the Sinhala majoritarian parties in the hope of getting the Tamils demands met in course of time. 

The TNA/ITAK has been witnessing a steady erosion of its support base in the North and East. This has been one of the reasons for Sampanthan to call for the unity of the Tamils

Meanwhile, Wigneswaran had founded or inspired the formation of the Tamil Peoples Council (TPC), a conglomerate of like-minded political and social bodies and individuals. The TPC is likely to be the nucleus of a political party which Wigneswaran may form nearer the next provincial election, which are likely in 2019, if not at the end of 2018. 
On his part, Sampanthan has been keeping up the refrain that the Tamils cannot afford to be disunited and that the TNA is the best bet to ensure unity and lead the Tamils, given its long history, its present strength, its standing among the Western democracies, and its acceptability to the Sri Lankan national leadership and the powers-that-be in New Delhi. 
But even as it called for unity, the Sampanthan faction has not reached out to the Wigneswaran faction. Nor has there been any attempt on the part of the Wigneswaran group to find common ground. Sampanthan and Wigneswaran would not even meet each other. 
While the Sampanthan faction has been busy with the process of drafting a new Sri Lankan constitution and taking up Tamil issues in parliament, Wignewaran and his cohorts have kept debunking these effortsas a farce. 
But Wignewaran has not been entirely wrong. The powers-that-be in Colombo have not yielded to the Tamils demands, even if many of these had been declared legitimate by the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission and the US-Sri Lanka co-sponsored resolution of 2015 at the UN Human Rights Council (UNHRC). 
The promised independent domestic Judicial Mechanism to go into charges of war crimes is yet to be set up. The Office of Missing Persons has only now come up and has a very long way to go before it can do the job it is meant to do, which is to trace the missing. 
The military are still holding acres and acres of private land. Suspected militants who are seen as political prisoners by the Tamils are still languishing in jail awaiting trial. 
Work on the new constitution was proceeding extremely well till it got to the penultimate stage of drafting, namely, deliberation at the Steering Committee headed by the Prime Minister. Work on it hasground to a halt. 
The TNA feels that the draft constitution will be presented to parliament eventually, because it has no clause which the Sinhalese Buddhist majority can oppose. But hopes of its getting to the next stage,which is a debate in the Constitutional Assembly, are receding by the day.This is an acute embarrassment to the Sampanthan group and is excellent grist to Wigneswarans mill. 
However, Wigneswarans demand for a muscular approach to the government and the Sinhala-majoritarian parties has been rejected by the Sampanthan group which swears by the wisdom of continuing the policy of persistent and patient engagement with all stakeholders.It also believes that the wishes and interests of the international community should also be kept in mind as the world outside has an axe to grind too. 
Meanwhile,elections are approaching. The TNA/ITAK has been witnessing a steady erosion of its support base in the North and East. It has reportedly slid from 80% in 2013 to 60% in 2015 and to 35% in the February 10 local bodies elections.This has been one of the reasons for Sampanthan to call for the unity of the Tamils. 
Sampanthan is aiming at uniting the Tamils under his leadership and under the banner of the TNA/ITAK. He is arguably the most respected and level headed leader the Tamils have now. The ITAK and TNA are still the single largest political groupings in the North and East. 

Wigneswaran made it clear that there can be no unification of different and contradictory ideologies and approaches

Interestingly, of later, Wigneswaran too has been calling for unity. But it is not a call without strings attached. In his speech at the launch of his book in Jaffna on Saturday, he spelt out the conditions of unity. 
Wigneswaran made it abundantly clear that there can be no unification of different and contradictory ideologies and approaches. It has to be an unity of perfectlylikeminded people.
He then went into a list of attributes people must have to make unification possible. The list was a verbatim repetition of the litany of complaints against the Sampanthan group, though he did not name the group or the leader. But everyone in the audience knew that the cap was meant to fit Sampanthan, who was the chief guest at the function.
But Wigneswaran thanked Sampanthan for accepting to be the chief guest; swore that he never acted against the TNA; and declared that he stood for TNAs unity. Explaining the contradictions in Wigneswarans stand (inviting Sampanthan to be the chief guest but repeating the complaints against him) a members of the Sampanthan faction said that Wigneswaran may be hoping to be put up as the TNA/ITAK candidate in the next Northern Provincial Council elections.  There isnt a ghost of a chance of Wigneswarans being the party candidate. But Sampanthan will not say this now.
He would like to keep Wigneswarans hopes alive, the member said. 
When rejected, which is certain, Wigneswaran will have to decide whether to float a new outfit and fight an election without an established party machinery to back him, or to get back to an apolitical life in Colombo.

Tough week ahead for Merkel as migration deadline approaches
	

DPA, 25th JUNE, 2018- German Chancellor Angela Merkel faces a crucial week that could decide the future of her government as she tackles a crisis about migration policy both at home and abroad.
She is struggling to contain a dispute with Interior Minister Horst Seehofer regarding whom to let into the country. He has threatened to start blocking some asylum seekers at the border from the beginning of next month.
Seehofer is also the head of Merkels coalition ally, the Bavarian Christian Social Union (CSU), meaning that the dispute has called into question the future of the three-way government with Merkels Christian Democrats (CDU) and the centre-left Social Democrats (SPD).
Merkel, who argues that unilateral decisions at the border will create problems with Germanys neighbours and undermine EU solidarity, received the backing of her centre-right CDU on Monday after a party meeting in Berlin.
The partys general secretary Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer said at a news conference that the CDU and CSU have always had their highs and lows, but that the partnership was still of great benefit to the CDU. On Tuesday Merkel faces a meeting of coalition leaders.

Traffic rules on the Eway to be strictly enforced: Traffic Police
	
The condition of vehicles entering the Expressways will be strictly checked due to the recent spate of fatal accidents, the Director of Traffic Administration and Road Safety, SP Indika Hapugoda said.
He said the decision was taken following the recent death of an Australian mother and her daughter, injuring two other Australians, when their van crashed into a lorry near the 65 km post at Kurundugahahetekma on the Southern Expressway (E01).
The accident had occurred due to driving with worn out tyres. Accidents bring traffic on the expressway to a standstill and it is very important to minimize accidents on the expressway by safe and disciplined driving, he said.
Therefore, the police officers attached to entrances at the expressways and exit posts have been instructed to check the condition of the vehicles, before entering the Expressway.
The condition of the tyres on vehicles, proper functioning of lights, dashboard indicators, brakes, steering system and seat belts for all passengers would be checked at the entrance point, SP Hapugoda said.
Vehicles entering the expressways should be in good condition because there are no lamp posts on the Southern Expressway. Vehicles with poor headlights and tail lights will easily meet with accidents, SP Hapugoda said.
In case of emergency, people are requested to dial 1969 immediately to inform the nearest police post on the expressway, for a faster, safer and secured journey, and abide by the rules and regulation, SP Hapugoda said.
Meanwhile, the Southern Expressway Deputy Director R.A.D. Kahatapitiya said, the police had been instructed to check the vehicle conditions a few days back.
There are lamp posts on the Colombo-Katunayaka Expressway (E03), but there aren't any on the Colombo-Matara expressway, except near bridges, Mr Kahatapitiya said.
Since the vehicles are driven at 100 kilometres per hour, a slight impact between vehicles or with a road barrier, sudden application of brakes or a turn may lead to secondary collision and the severity of damages in an expressway accident will be higher than in a normal road.
When you are trying to enter the Expressway, if you notice that there is no safe gap between the vehicles already on the expressway, keep in mind that you might need to stop the vehicle in the acceleration lane until you find a safe gap between vehicles, Mr. Kahatapitiya said.
