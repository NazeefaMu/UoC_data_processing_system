A Full Day?s Literature
	
On October 7, A & K (Annasi and Kadalagotu) Lit. Festival comes to life at the Mount Lavinia Hotel, starting at 10 a.m. to last till sundown.?
It is a well-structured trilingual programme that will give an expanse of local literature to the participant under the adage ?Simply literature simply local?.??
Yes, the charge is only Rs. 100 so that it is affordable to anyone who is interested in listening to literary discussions in the language of his/her preference.? ?
As for the programme it is difficult to pick and highlight events as they are all equally palatable to those who visit the festival.? ?
There are veteran authors and poets sharing the stage with newcomers to the scene; each of them willing to discuss the ups and downs and the cheers and tears of the writing world.? ?
The event is a must for those who wish to get into the annals of authorship in the form of short story, novel or poetry in the Sinhala, Tamil and English literacy that Sri Lanka is endowed with.? ?
Just to give a sneak peek of what I know least about, there is a session facilitated by Nalaka Gunawardena, science writer, who will have three eminently qualified panelists discussing the modernised world of cyber communication.? ?
This sure is the ?in? thing where conventional writing takes a new direction where bloggers, satirists and e-book promoters thrive. I do not know enough to talk more on this subject as I belong to the old school, but I will surely be sitting in the audience to find out what this new media world of writing is all about.??
Let me now move on to something that I am more familiar with. The magnificent Mahinda Masimbula will do a solo session about his award-winning book ?Senkottan?.? ?
It is perhaps the best book I have read in the last 10 years. In my humble opinion, the man from Yakkala is sure in the class of Chinua Achebe, Khalid Hosseini and Rohinton Mistry.? ?
He is that good, and to see him on stage talking about what he wrote and why, is something I would not miss for anything. That will be local literature at its best.? ?
There are Gratiaen Winners spaced in different discussions; there are new authors who have come to the scene with excellent books that are doing the rounds giving them the place they deserve in Sri Lankan literature. All these twined together will make a wonderful tapestry of multi-coloured literature in multi-lingual formats.??
The Mount Lavinia Hotel itself will add a fantastic ambience to the entire event with its colonial heritage. Its doors will be open and the red carpet will be rolled out for all and sundry. I do not know how accurate I am in this statement, but I did hear it mentioned that Publis Silva, the Grandmaster Chef, will create a special fare of Annasi and Kadala to compliment the theme of this festival.? ?
At sundown, there will be an open-mike session of poetry, supposedly a favourite of the young adult who may wish to enjoy the closing of the curtain with a glass of ice cool beer in hand.? ?
The festival is tri-lingually remarkable, the Mount Lavinia Hotel setting is majestic and the programme is ?simply literature, simply local?.? ?
That is A & K for you. One just can?t go wrong spending hundred rupees for this full day?s entertainment.?
-Capt. Elmo Jayawardena? ??

Committee report: PHU questions status given to Buddhism
	
The Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) said today the Interim Report of the Steering Committee on Constitutional Reforms had craftily challenged the foremost status given to Buddhism despite the assurance given by MP Jayampathy Wickramaratne.
PHU Leader and MP, Udaya Gammanpila said according to Dr. Wickramaratne the foremost status given to Buddhism had not been harmed.
?The Sangha including the Mahanayakes say the prominence given to Buddhism had been harmed by the new report. Two alternatives have been suggested in the new report for the clause 9, which define the status given to Buddhism. The first alternative is almost identical to the existing clause,? he told a news briefing.
The MP said the second alternative suggests Buddhism should be given prominence and also that all religions should be treated equally without discrimination. ?If all religions are to be treated equally, no specific religion can be given prominence,? he said.
The MP said the President and the Prime Minister repeatedly said the ?unitary? character of the country and the status given to Buddhism would not be changed. ?If that is the case, let the two clauses regarding these two facts remain unchanged. Why play with words?? he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Defining Dots: An Art Exhibition
	
Defining Dots, a presentation of art by the students of the Hardy Centre of Arts, was held on September 30 and October 1, at the Lionel Wendt Art Gallery Colombo 7.
Another exhibition is held? under the guiding hand of Rhuani Rambukwella, who gives her students the freedom to explore talents that may have been dormant or just needed a guiding hand.? ?
A stroke here, a line there, and her students see their pieces of art turning into master pieces.? ?
This year the focus has been on a style of Aboriginal Art that makes extensive use of dots of colour.? ?
It originated in the desert using natural substances and various diameters of sticks dipped into paint and then applied one dot at a time.? ?
Her advanced students were inspired by this art form and experimented by using a multitude of dots to emphasize illustrations bringing out a vibrant collision of colour.? ?
Their canvases and palettes vary according to the individual. The result has been strikingly different to other exhibitions.? ?
Her classes are filled to capacity as her students young and old learn the joy of mediums that vary from water colours, charcoal, oils, acrylics, pen and ink, the use of felt pens, as they mingle with gum, spirits or just plain water, all working together to present a burst of colour, an incredible work of art that has been drawn from deep within the artist to give satisfaction to those who gaze upon it.? ?
A young artist wise in years said nonchalantly, ?Why is it that every artist thinks his work is not good enough, when actually what he has created is brilliant.?? Art conveys a silent message but strikes a chord deep within each one. You like it or leave it.? ?
The exhibition featured the works created by artists of varying ages.? ?
They are: Abigail Schaffter, Avlok Wignaraja, Anmol Rajwani, Anya Abhayaratne, Annika Warnakulasuriya, Mira Wignaraja, Rosanna Warnakulasuriya, Ranudi Thotawatte, Tiyara Senanayake, Vanessa Abdeen., Sarinda Abeynaike, Dhilhan Fernando, Thimanya Ellepola, Matthew Witharna, Nirmala de Silva, Sithumya Gunasinghe, Anasha Tirathdas, Savithri Jayanetti, Kiara Abhayaratne, Hriday Mohnani, Shanalie Kularatne, Shenali Jayasundera, Himsara Caldera and Shanuk Goonetilleke.? ?

The Government Medical Officers? Association (GMOA) today threatened that it would launch a 24 hour islandwide strike on Friday if the Post Internship appointment list is not withdraw by Thursday (5).
Addressing a press conference in Colombo, GMOA Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said the list had been issued without the transfer board?s consent where GMOA is also part of and it was published in the social media without uploading it to the Official website which is also a violation.
Dr. Aluthge said the matter had been discussed at the GMOA executive committee meeting and the membership expressed their objection towards the commenced Post internship appointment list due to its illegality.
He said the list had been prepared by the Director of the Medical Service Dr. Priyantha Athapaththu without advicing the transfer committee, was based on a arbitrary decision.
He also charged the list was prepared disregarding peripheral hospitals of the country therefore could pose a threat to the services provided by such hospitals.
The GMOA urged the authorities to withdraw the alleged illegal Post internship appointment list and prepare a new list with the consent of the transfer committee to safe guard the country?s health services.
Also the GMOA said it would lodge a written complaint along with the Public Service Commission against the issued list seeking an immediate inquiry over Medical Service Director Dr. Priyantha Athapaththu for his arbitrary decisions. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

## Title: Handa Eliyata Wedi Thiyanna stops short of firing
## Section: News Features

Handa Eliyata Wedi Thiyanna stops short of firing
	
?
Nita Fernando made her name as a film star in the 1960s in popular, entertaining films such as Sathischandra Edirisinghe?s Matara Aachchi and Rajagedara Paraviyo, and moved on to more sensitive character roles in films such as Wijaya Dharmashri?s Duhulu Malak, which established her as one of our leading actresses.? ?
She?s a prolific actress who made over 40 films in the first decade of her career. Her role as an abused domestic forced into prostitution in Hadawath Neththo remains one of her most memorable commercial cinema roles.??
Her comeback after a decade spent abroad involved her mainly in the cinema, culminating in her winning an international award for her role as Violet in Prasanna Withanage?s Pauru Walalu.??
But now she has opted to play the lead role in a Sinhala play ? Tanuj Anawaratne?s Handa Eliyata Wedi Thiyanna (Shoot the moonlight).? ?
If this director?s name is not familiar to today?s theatre goers, that would be because he is making a comeback after a long break, having made a name for himself at the national youth drama festival in the 1990s. This is his fourth drama. Interestingly, he and Nita Fernando have worked together before, but in the cinema, when she acted in his 2007 film Nisalagiri.??
The play opens with an impressive set. Undoubtedly due to economic reasons, many Sri Lankan plays try to get by with mediocre sets, while some have actors on an almost bare stage. But the set is a very important component of the theatre. It sets the mood and is important as an introductory element to the play?s events, moods and characters.? ?
In this play, the mood created by the set ? a swinging bench to the left, a lotus-filled pond in the foreground, a bench to the right, and a doctor?s table with chair at the centre ? creates an almost Chekhovian mood.??
As the play got going, however, the mood became not Chekhovian but very Sri Lankan via the dialogue and acting methods. But Handa Eliyata Wedi Thiyanna tries, while working in a conventional format, a novel approach. The play opens with Jayanath Bandara (Rohan) playing a guitar and singing. There are several songs in the play, though it isn?t a musical.??
This romantic, sentimental mood, however, quickly becomes harsh. The story (scripted by the director) progresses in a series of short acts without an intermission break. The mood quickly becomes confrontational. What unfolds is a story of marital infidelity involving a politically powerful family. Nita Fernando (Janaki) is the daughter of the Minister of Culture. Her husband Rohan is a director general in that Ministry. She?s older and he?s married her for her money and privileges. He is virtually a one-man cultural Police force, preaching and moralising to the public.? ?
Neither men is qualified for his jobs. While the father at least makes an effort, the son is more interested in having a casual affair with his young Secretary Sankethi (Nadishani Peliarachchi).??
There is a secondary plot involving Rohan and Janaki?s inability to have a child. This is where Rohan?s old friend Dr. Sumith (Janaka Kumbukage) comes in.? ?
He runs an abortion clinic. The resulting scenes between the two friends are crude. The Sinhala theatre (Like our commercial cinema) has a dependency on sexual innuendo and ?double meanings? to entertain the viewer.? ?
Here, there is absolutely no need for innuendo. The language is blunt enough. Its credibility won?t be questioned if the two characters were politicians. This kind of language is common enough at these ?higher levels? especially when referring to women.??
But in our minds, a doctor and Ministerial Secretary, however beastly they might be as men, would be wearing more refined cloaks. This is where the credibility of these two womanising characters is tested via the horrific language they use.??
Rohan?s character, however, is rescued from two-dimensional oblivion by one thing. When informed by the doctor that it?s his wife who is infertile, he tells her that both share the same medical condition. This act of kindness lifts him above the ordinary. But it?s difficult to reconcile the romantic with the guitar and the completely crude character we meet in the doctor?s clinic.??
All four actors give excellent performances. But the play fails to exploit the possibilities offered by the plot.? ?
	Via its music, set design and stage management, it achieves a level of sophistication not seen often in?the Sinhala theatre nowadays.??
	
	
	All four actors give excellent performances. But the play fails to exploit the possibilities offered by the plot.? ?
	
	
	If that plot weakness can be sorted out, Handa Eliyata Wedi Thiyanna could well be a more?absorbing play.? ?
	
	
	There is a secondary plot involving Rohan and Janaki?s inability to have a child. This is where Rohan?s old friend Dr. Sumith (Janaka kumbukage) comes in.? ?
	
	
	If that plot weakness can be sorted out, Handa Eliyata Wedi Thiyanna could well be a more absorbing play.
	
	
	Hopefully, Nita Fernando?s stage appearance will encourage others too, to perform on stage.??
	
?
When it is found out that the mistress? pregnancy is far too advanced to attempt an abortion, the solution offered by the doctor to his old pal is unconvincing. It is like throwing a bucket of water into a simmering fire. When the play ends, it feels as if the story has progressed only half-way.??
If that plot weakness can be sorted out, Handa Eliyata Wedi Thiyanna could well be a more absorbing play.? ?
Otherwise, via its music, set design and stage management, it achieves a level of sophistication not seen often in the Sinhala theatre nowadays.??
In fact, Nita Fernando?s stage appearance and the energy she puts into this role should encourage our film actors of both sexes to work in the theatre. Many of them got their start in the theatre. Rukmani Devi, Malani Fonseka and Kaushalya Fernando come to mind, as well as Mahendra Perera and H. A. Perera. But most of them forget their cradle once they make a name in the cinema.??
Veterans like W. Jayasiri and Jayalath Manoratne are equally at home in both spheres, as well as younger personalities such as Duleeka Marapana, Jagath Chamila and Sarath Kothalawala. Gamini Fonseka made a solitary appearance in the 1980s in Tony Ranasinghe?s production of Shakespeare?s Julius Caesar. The late H. A. Perera and Richard de Zoysa loved acting in both mediums.??
But obviously many regard the theatre as a lot of hard work for little reward. This is sad because in the West, many film stars of international repute have worked with equal enthusiasm in both. Laurence Olivier, Russian actor Lev Durov and Yul Brynner (Russian born) are celebrated examples. Meryl Streep has played Brecht?s Mother Courage.? ?
Hopefully, Nita Fernando?s stage appearance will encourage others too, to perform on stage.??

The term of office of newly appointed Navy Commander Vice Admiral Travis Sinniah, who turned 55 on September 26, had only been extended by one month by President Maithripala Sirisena, sources said.
Although the President has the power to extend the tenure of the Navy Commander by another year he has only been granted a one month extension which would now expire on October 26.
The sources said it was yet too early to say whether the Navy Commander's term would be extended further after his term expires.

PCoI sitting resume: Cross-examination of Ex-CB Governor to continue
	
After a weeks break, the proceedings at the Presidential Commission of Inquiry (PCoI) were due to resume today (2).
It is also likely that the cross-examination of former Central Bank Governor Arjuna Mahendran by Additional Solicitor General Dappula De Livera would continue today as well.
Following the startling facts that emerged during the cross-examination of Mr. Mahendran on Friday (22), the PCoI comprising Justice K.T. Chitrasiri (Chairman), Justice Prasanna Jayawardena and Retired Deputy Auditor General Kandasamy Velupillai adjourned proceedings which would re-commence today at 10 am.
During the previous sitting Additional Solicitor General Dappula De Livera suggested to the witness that no requirement of funds to the amount of Rs.75 bn was reflected in the cash-flow statements of the Treasury on March, 2015 or April, 2015, hence the witness was lying about the February 26 meeting with Ministers Ravi Karunanayake, Kabir Hashim and other officials.
Bringing up another irregularity ASG De Livera questioned the witness as to why the letter sent by Minister Ravi Karunanayake so long ago was still crisp and fresh when it was submitted to the Commission, to which the witness answered that he kept this letter carefully and that was the reason for its freshness.
The ASG also suggested that the Govt.?s urgent fund requirement mentioned by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe in Parliament and the total bid amount of Rs. 15 bn made by the company in the centre of the bond scam controversy Perpetual Treasuries Ltd. at the Feb 27 auction were ironically similar.(Shehan Chamika Silva)

SL beat Pakistan by 21 runs
	
Sri Lanka beat Pakistan by 21 runs in the first Test of the 2-Test series as Pakistan failed to chase down a meagre 136-run target and were all out for 114. Sri Lanka lead the series 1-0 now.
Pakistan were 67 for 5 at Tea and with skipper Sarfraz Ahmad and Haris Sohail still at the crease, there was some hope still in the Test for the hosts. However, Pakistan kept losing wickets after the Tea break. Sarfraz got out after scoring 19 runs while Haris Sohail scored 34 runs, highest in the innings.
Pakistan were fighting to overhaul a modest but tricky 136-run target as they reached tea at 67-5 on the fifth and final day of the first Test in Abu Dhabi on Monday.
Skipper Sarfraz Ahmed was unbeaten on 13 and Haris Sohail 19 as Pakistan still need another 69 runs in the final session to take a 1-0 lead in the two-match series.
Earlier, leg-spinner Yasir Shah took 5-51 -- his 32nd five wicket haul in Tests -- to dismiss Sri Lanka for 138 in their second innings.
With the ball taking spin on a difficult Sheikh Zayed Stadium pitch, Pakistani batsmen struggled against veteran left-arm spinner Rangana Herath (2-19) and off-spinner Dilruwan Perera (2-25).
Herath dismissed opener Sami Aslam for two before accounting for Asad Shafiq who made a fighting 20, reaching within four wickets of the 400-wicket milestone in his 84th Test.
Perera then had Shan Masood (seven) and a shaky Babar Azam for three to leave Pakistan struggling at 32-4.
In between fast bowler Suranga Lakmal had Azhar Ali caught behind for nought.
Pakistan, led by Shah, bowled well in the morning.
Sri Lanka, who resumed at 69-4, lost their last six wickets for 69 runs. Niroshan Dickwella fought hard during his unbeaten knock of 40 studded with four boundaries.
The second Test -- a day-night match -- starts in Dubai from Friday. (Dunya News)

Sri Lankan refugee found dead on Manus Island
	
A Sri Lankan asylum seeker has died while being held in Australian immigration detention on Manus Island, Australian media reported.
The man was a Sri Lankan Tamil asylum seeker, and was reportedly in Lorengau Hospital receiving treatment for mental illness.
The Manus Island police chief, David Yapu, told Fairfax , ?We had a suicide of a refugee at the Lorengau hospital in the early hours of this morning.? This man is the second refugee to die by suicide on Manus Island in the past two months.
The death is one of a handful of tragic and preventable deaths (including six on Manus Island alone) that have occurred in the detention centres in the past few years. The latest has happened against the backdrop of Turnbull shutting down the facility on Manus Island.
The Manus Island detention centre is being closed after Papua New Guinea ruled that the detention centre ? which is run by PNG government and law-enforcement officials but sponsored by the Australian Federal Government ? was in violation of human rights.
In 2016 the PNG Supreme Court ruled in a landmark decision that the centre breached the PNG constitutional right to personal liberty. Additionally, the Prime Minister of PNG, Peter O?Neill, somewhat ominously said to reporters, ?We did not anticipate the asylum seekers to be kept as long as they have at the Manus centre.?
The recent death on Manus Island is said to have exponentially increased anxiety and distress for other detainees, the majority of whom are suffering from depression, Generalised Anxiety Disorder and Post Traumatic Stress Syndrome. The head of the Refugeee Action Coalition, Ian Rintoul, has told reporters, ?The death has increased the anxiety and distress among all the refugees and asylum seekers on Manus as they struggle with their own circumstances. There are two other extremely mentally distressed people who urgently need assistance.?
Last year a review into mental health conditions in Australian offshore detention revealed that around 215 of the 400 people who completed a 2014 Harvard Trauma Questionaire exhibited signs of severe mental distress. Those refugees who have been interned for more than two years are at increased risk of suffering mental illness, and children (who are still interred in Australian-sponsored offshore camps despite frequent government protests to the contrary) are said to be at the most extreme risk.
This latest death has happened just days after Immigration and Border Protection Minister Peter Dutton?s bizarre rant about ?Armani refugees? sunning themselves on the beaches of Nauru and Manus Island, which anyone with half a brain knows? is not the situation at all.

## Title: THE FED-UP SYNDROME  IS HERE TO STAY

THE FED-UP SYNDROME  IS HERE TO STAY
	
It?s the result of certain Johnnies? theme:??to hell with everyone else, but us?
After one failure after another, one dream lost? e is of selfish individuals and elite groups in social, business and political clubs in positions of advantage misusing power; the other group comprises all kinds of workers? unions and associations. There is a difference between them though; while the elite group operates unpretentiously, trade unions are vociferous and openly aggressive?even hostile. However, both groups share a common approach ?we must have it? and ?to hell with everybody else?. The result of this real-life scenario is that citizen Pereras, Nagarajahs, Mohideens and Van Houtens from every nook and corner of this country fall victim to the common Fed-up virus.
Bernard is fed-up?
Although the Wallside bar was clearly a thirst-aid station it provided another comforting option?a chance to voice opinions freely, share views and indulge in arguments that at times lead to instances when friends forget their friends. Awkward; but that?s how it goes.
Judging by the crowd of tipplers congregated at the Wallside bar that evening the common Fed-up germ had hit many below the belt.?
?Let?s have a warm up shot,? suggested Bernard, a glum-looking man to his companion, Rajah who also seemed down in the dumps. They were certainly not of the so-called elite; just ordinary guys in their thirties who most probably went to work on bikes, went shopping on bikes and transported their wives and kids also on bikes. Both men as members of a huge Fed-up population were in need of an artificial mood lift to face their Fed-up families at home. ?Sure, sure,? agreed Rajah joining Bernard heading for the crowded bar.
Recognised by the barmen as regulars, it did not take long for them to be seated at a corner table with two straight ?Arros? in front of them. After a long gulp of fire water, Bernard announced: ?I have to take amma to see a specialist doc machan. Her clinic day didn?t happen because of this damn doc strike.??
?That?s going to be expensive, no? Channelled docs are gold diggers. If your mother is a new patient, a specialist Shylock will want this test and that test done. He is plucking a new hen?your mother. How are you for dough??
?Broke; but she has finished all her pills. I have no choice but channel a doc. Holding the sick hostage these GMOA docs are supposed to be caring angels. What bloody rubbish! Striking over anything everybody knows they are just mudalalis fleecing the sick. And the way the buggers are fingering in the country?s affairs they may as well sit in Parliament and do some doctoring in the House,? laughed Bernard.
?Machan the GMOA is an example of a ?to hell with everyone else but us?, approach. There are others too with the same stance increasing the numbers of a nationally catchy Fed-up syndrome. So we are not the only Fed-up guys around,? commented Rajah after a carter-sized gulp of Arro.
Fed-up has wide borders
Tommo a pussycat lying nearby stretched luxuriously and yawned. His working partner, Ooty an owl was perched on the arm of a vacant chair nearby. As old employees of the Wallside Restaurant and Bar they had developed a habit of listening to governors? bar conversations when speech was uninhibited. ?Those two governors have a point,? pussy purred knowingly.?
?Yeah, yeah?, responded the wise-looking bird, ?I hate to be in their shoes ...? the bird paused when it heard Bernard declare, ?I tell you machan, these days everybody has to fend for themselves because no-one helps with their problems.? Governments have been no-gos; no heart in any of their bailout attempts.?
?Whoom, whooom,?? hooted Ooty blinking rapidly. ?Who hasn?t problems??
Purshshtt,? hissed pussy turning on its back paws up. ?All the Fed-ups can do is keep rocking their boats.??
?Some do solo acts as well. Recently a maddo climbed a tree threatening to do a hara-kiri jump if his kid was not admitted to Grade One, ?hooted the bird.
?Meeooww! Our governors have hit the zenith of Mount Fed-up and their reactions are justifiable. Governments and their servants are using sticking plasters to dress? the wounds of the mahajanathawa as temporary fixes. But this governor?s grouse is with docs? strikes that have become commoner than common flu. Their latest pain is a million-dollar baby of a private medical school and government sticking plastering has not worked.???
?Ha-ha-haaaa,? laughed Ooty the way owls do. ?There is a thick-skinned side to doc strikes. With the strike going hot-hot, the president of the GMOA its vice president, treasurer, committee, peons and others carrying GMOA genes are busy in private practice. Yah, yah, it?s true; shameless beggars with crosses on their windshields advertising themselves as docs. Don?t you think skull and cross-bone stickers are closer to the truth. ?
?Ones with Satan sporting horns are better,? meowd pussy. ?Docs as Fed-up creators are playing pandu these days. There are other Fed-up producers as well. Take two common examples: Electrick-city types shocking governors and making babies yell their heads off in the dark. But do these Electrick-city types care a hoot? The watermen are no better with unannounced water cuts. If they announce water cuts from Bamba to Fort from 5 pm to 6 am the following day, they happily? cut water from Mount to Moratuwa from 9 am to 5 pm the day after that. The Electrick-city and watermen don?t care a damn if our governors have no lights, no baths and use newspaper in toilets. They are leaders of to ?hell with everyone else but us club? ?
??making our governors? Fed-up ranks swell like hell,? hooted the bird interrupting pussy.
?The biggest Fed-up creator
?The biggest Fed-up creators are politiccas, governments and their satellites all over the country. After being voted to power they forget their pre-election plans and assurances and turn to a theme; ?this is the way we want it and do it; we come first and to hell with the rest? and bat the way they want.?? meowed pussy.?
?Hoooot! Hoooot! I agree; be it in education, chronically ill government departments, pradeshiya sabhas, councils and their rusty and crusty custodians , telephones, TV, hospitals and medicines, shopping, bussing, taking train, taxis and taxes and a cost of living heading towards another galaxy, our governors? are just Fed-up.?
?Meeooooow,?interrupted pussy. ?Governments have been habitually spitting on burning fires through palanayas of their own making; Ape Palanaya; Avul Palanaya;? Mage Dakma. Gothra Palanaya, Yama Palanaya right up to the present Yaha Palanaya. Sadly, our governors have kept voting hoping a new gang of talkers would perform better than the previous one. No bloody way; they all turn out to be ?to hell with everybody else but us? Johnnies.?
Bull?s eye
Pussy was interrupted by Bernard. As if he had been following the exchange between the pussy and the bird, he fog-horned, ?So machan my question is why vote at all? Local elections are in the air and that means we are going to be landed with new loads of bugger-alls. The very thought made me so sick I did not register as a voter this time.?
?Neither did I, nor any in our crowd machan,? pussy heard Rajah say; ?Hundreds and thousands in the country are fed up with their leaders who keep pretending they are performing Full Monty acts for our benefit. Damn nonsense of course; no government has loosened their belts even to begin a Full Monty act. Frankly I don?t think they can do one at all. So what?s the point in voting???
?Aha? hooted the bird at Rajah?s remark. ?He doesn?t know that?s the only right he has? And he should use it. There?s always that chance of getting a fair, just, incorruptible and understanding leader appearing?
?Purshshttttt! ? hissed the angry pussy. ?For your info I have read of just one such leader in history; Emperor Asoka of India; and that pal was some 2500 years ago.?

Travel ban on Aloysius
	
Colombo Fort Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne today imposed a travel ban on Perpetual Treasuries Limited owner Arjun Aloysius, its CEO Kasun Palisena, its Chief Dealer Nuwan Salgado and IT Executive Sachith Devathantri after the CID filed a facts report in Court over the alleged deletion of phone call data from PTL?s voice recording system and fabricating evidence given to the Commission.
The CID had commenced an investigation upon the instructions of the Attorney General in connection with the revelation that transpired during the proceedings of the Bond Commission.
Earlier, the PTL had told the Commission that it had given all the data that it had with the voice recording system. However, after startling confessions made by PTL IT expert Sachith Devatantri and its Chief Dealer Nuwan Salgado before the Commission, it was revealed that there was a deletion of some voice recordings.
Subsequently, the Attorney General instructed the CID to start a criminal investigation with regard to the revelation. (Shehan Chamika Silva)

U.S. directly communicating with North Korea
	
?
REUTERS, 1 October, 2017-? The United States said on Saturday it was directly communicating with North Korea on its nuclear and missile programmes but Pyongyang had shown no interest in dialogue.??
The disclosure by U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson during a trip to China represented the first time he has spoken to such an extent about U.S. outreach to North Korea over its pursuit of a nuclear-tipped intercontinental ballistic missile.? ?We are probing so stay tuned,? Tillerson told a group of reporters in Beijing.??
?We ask: ?Would you like to talk?? We have lines of communications to Pyongyang. We?re not in a dark situation, a blackout.???
He said that communication was happening directly and cited two or three U.S. channels open to Pyongyang.??
?We can talk to them. We do talk to them,? he said, without elaborating about which Americans were involved in those contacts or how frequent or substantive they were.??
The goal of any initial dialogue would be simple: finding out directly from North Korea what it wants to discuss.? ?We haven?t even gotten that far yet,? he said.??

Update: At least 50 dead, 200 injured in Las Vegas shooting
	
More than 50 people have been killed and at least 200 injured in a mass shooting at a Las Vegas concert, the BBC reported.
A gunman opened fire from the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay Hotel toward an open-air music festival being held close by.
Police said a suspect identified as a local resident, who was not named, had been shot and killed by officers.
They said they were looking for a companion travelling with the suspect as a "person of interest".
Hundreds of people fled the scene and the sound of what appeared to be prolonged automatic gunfire could be heard on videos posted on social media.
There had been reports of other incidents at different locations along the Las Vegas strip, but police say they believe the dead suspect acted alone.
A hospital spokeswoman said 14 of the wounded were in a critical condition.
Witnesses reported that hundreds of shots were fired.
Many hotels on the Las Vegas strip close to the scene remain on lockdown.
Parts of Las Vegas Boulevard were shut as armed police arrived at the scene of the attack.
People have been sheltering in hotels, restaurants and at Las Vegas McCarran airport.
Some flights were diverted after news of the incident emerged.
The country music festival had been taking place since Friday at several hotels on the Las Vegas strip. (BBC)
