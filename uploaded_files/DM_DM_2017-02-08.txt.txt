A coming event casting its shadow
	

A Betel leaf purohita in yahapalanaya has now come out with all guns firing at the FCID.

Highly surprised higher authorities have now found out the real reason why the quiet and soft-spoken purohita had suddenly gone gung-ho.
This purohita held similar status in the previous regime as well and Police sleuths have begun investigating a deal involving several billions of rupees he had wrapped up while handling a subject related to a highly inflammatory product. The man is highly upset over it, they say.
This purohita who once held a responsible office in the Betel leaf alliance has also now begun developing an affection for the JO and in fact, he had even expressed his delight over the success of the JOs public rally at Nugegoda. The purohitas conduct has set many wondering whether his growing affection for the JO will culminate in a double-cross in the near future.

A mini-protest at the protest rally
	

The hullabaloo triggered by the JOs stalwart from the Gampaha political family when he left the stage at the recent Nugegoda public rally to sit on the ground is no longer news to the people.

However, only a few people seem to know that the Gampaha stalwart staged this sit-in to protest the refusal by organizers to accommodate on the stage a provincial councilor who, he claimed, brought about 3,000 supporters from Gampaha district to the rally on his behalf.
Given the security concerns, Nuwara Mahi, Matara Kanchana and Kalutara Rohita had been put in charge of screening those seeking a place on the stage and when the Gampaha stalwart got on to the stage with his PC member-buddy in tow, they had berated him for bringing up an unwanted person and ordered the PC member to leave the stage. A heated exchange ensued and the Gampaha stalwart livid with rage had left the stage with his buddy and had sat on the ground opposite the stage as a show of his displeasure.
However, the verbal dual had continued even after that until the former strongman who arrived in the meantime intervened to make peace, they say.

A rittual to banish malefic influences
	

An all-night- Bali-thovil ceremony held at the Colombo 7 residence of a VIP recently is the main talking point in political circles these days.

The VIP is a lady holding a very high political office in a certain province and she is an oracle of sorts patronized by political high-ups, they say.
Earlier in the day, a lorry-load of plantain stems and bundles of tender coconut fronds had been unloaded and several kapuralas had arrived at the residence which was already a hive of activity.
Minutes before the thovil ritual got underway with chanting of customary benedictory stanzas, invocations and tom-tom beating, a very high political authority had arrived there along with his family members. The racket raised by the thovil that continued till the wee hours of the following morning kept the entire neighbourhood awake, they say.

Plans had been finalized for the sale of our loss- making airline and a tug o war between two powerful parties has stalled the selection of a suitable buyer.

There is a persistent attempt to sell the airline to a tenderer who made a lower bid ignoring the highest bidder, they say.
A purohita from the Colombo district facing the loss of his portfolio due to weighty allegations against him has entered the fray in a bid to offer the airline on a platter to a friendly Maldivian firm while a prominent character who was behind the sensational main bank fiasco is said to be resorting to subtle means to sell it to a Yankee company.
Number One who has received the disconcerting reports may shortly decide to intervene to have his own say on the matter as in the case of the recent sweep ticket price controversy, informed sources say.

The police report on the shooting at the SAITM Chief Executive Officer's vehicle will be submitted to Parliament no sooner the investigations are over, Prime minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said yesterday.
"We don't know anything about the incident and the investigation has just begun," he said when Chief Opposition Whip Anura Kumara Dissanayake requested that the investigation report on the incident be presented to Parliament to avoid any serious situations that might arise.
"Speculation is rife on this shooting incident in the wake of several speaking against SAITM while several are defending the medical school. Therefore it is essential that a proper investigation is done and the report presented to Parliament," Mr. Dissanayake said.(Yohan Perera)

Clinical South Africa makes it 4-0
	
Clinical South Africa withstood an Upul Tharanga onslaught to register a nervy 40-run win over Sri Lanka in the fourth ODI played at the Newlands Cricket Grounds in Cape Town last night.
Sri Lanka needed to pull off the highest successful run-chase at the Newlands after South Africa posted a record 367 for five but despite a swashbuckling start, they lacked firepower in their batting to put the finishing touches as they were bowled out for 327 runs - their highest total in the series.
Opener Tharanga and Dickwella breathed fire on a dead track scoring 100 runs off the first 10 overs in a brutal display of power-hitting but once they were gone, the writing was on the wall for the islanders.
Tharanga smashed his first century since 2013, 119 off 90 balls with seven sixes and 11 boundaries as Sri Lanka were on course for a record chase on 216 for two after 29 overs, but Wayne Parnell turned it around for South Africa by picking the marauding Sri Lankan batsman at backward point.
With that Sri Lankas hopes were all but shattered as the inexperienced middle order lacked the firepower to put the finishing touches to what would have been a remarkable comeback win to end their losing streak.
Sri Lanka lost their last six wickets for just 20 runs, having being on a comfortable 307 for four by the 40th over of the match.
The 32-year-old veteran opener who made his way back to the side after being overlooked for almost two years, reached his half century off 25 balls with four sixes and five boundaries and shared an imposing 139 for the first wicket with Dickwella who departed for a well made 58 - his second half century in the series.
Tharanga and Kusal Mendis then added further 64 runs for the second wicket but Parnell had Kusal edging one to the keeper, ending a threatening partnership.
Sandun Weerakkody who replaced the misfiring Dinesh Chandimal rode his luck, having being dropped twice on 15 and 35 to reach his maiden half century - 58 off 51 and to take Sri Lanka closer, sharing 79 runs for the fifth wicket with Asela Gunaratne (38) but failed to change the course of the match.
Sri Lankas performances certainly gave a scare for the hosts who at one stage looked like deer caught in the headlights as Sri Lanka were racing towards the target, but the Proteas hit back at crucial moments to win the match.
Parnell was the pick of the bowler claiming four for 58 while Imran Tahir, Dwaine Pretorius and Kagiso Rabada shared two wickets apiece.
Earlier, Francois du Plessis struck a career-best 185, his second in the series as South Africa amassed a record 367 for five, the highest score at the Newlands from their 50 overs.
There innings was decorated with some useful contributions from Skipper A. B. de Villiers (64), Quinton de Kock (55) and Farhaan Behardien (36 not out) who batted around du Plessis much to the delight of the packed Newlands crowd.
The victory was South Africas fourth in five-match series and will now look for a clean sweep when the teams return to Centurion for the final ODI on Friday (10).
Sri Lanka got off to a fine start when opener Hashim Amla edged to Asela Gunaratne at slips from the bowling of Lahiru Kumara in the second over to leave South Africa three for one.

But du Plessis who joined de Kock revived the innings with a 100-run second wicket stand off 87 balls before Tharanga held onto a superb one handed catch to remove Kock off the bowling of Sachith Pathirana.
Skipper de Villiers and du Plessis then shared an imposing 137 runs off 119 balls for the third wicket before Pathirana bowled de Villiers through his legs when the latter attempted to paddle sweep.
But by then South Africa had reached 240 with 13.5 overs to go. The pair worked well in tandem and punished the Sri Lankan bowlers with great aggression.
However with de Villiers departure for his 50th half ton, a score in excess of 350 looked a bit tough, but du Plessis and Behardien combined to bring South Africas highest total at this venue.
Du Plessis reached his 100 runs off 89 balls and 150 off 129 balls before perishing just three runs short of South Africas highest individual score of 188 set by Garry Kirsten in the final over of the innings.
He was particularly ruthless towards the latter part of his innings with some clean hits before Lahiru Madushanka picked him for the second time in a row.
Du Plessis who hit 16 boundaries and three sixes in his 149-ball innings, shared a brisk 74 off just 29 deliveries with Behardien to take South Africa to a huge total.
Behardien was unbeaten on 36 off 20 balls. For Sri Lanka seamer Lahiru Kumara and Pathirana picked up two wickets each.(Champika Fernando in Cape Town)

Divulapitiya controversy: War of words between Ranjan and Indika
	
Uncomplimentary language, allegations and counter allegations were the order of the day during the initial part of the parliamentary sessions yesterday when Deputy Minister Ranjan Ramanayake and joint opposition MP Indika Anuruddha were trading words on Divulapitiya incident.
It happened when the deputy minister rose to answer an oral question asked by the MP regarding the Divulapitiya electorate. The opposition MPs attempted to raise objections saying it is the Leader of the House, the Chief Government Whip or the subject minister who has to answer the question.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe in his response said he had permitted the deputy minister to answer the question as per Standing Order 27. However Speaker Karu Jayasuriya overruled him and directed Chief Government Whip Gayantha Karunatilleke to answer the question.
Matters hotted up when the deputy minister attempted to explain saying the MP and his family were engaged in illegal sand mining in the area. "The whole of Divulapitiya has been destroyed because of illegal sand mining in the area," he said.
The MP then showed a letter written by deputy minister to Minister Kabir Hashim asking him for an an access road to a quarry. "The deputy minister has made this request on behalf of his henchmen who are engaged in a business of supplying rock stones for the port city project," he said.
Deputy Minister Ajith P. Perera who joined in the verbal tussle said the document which was tabled by the MP should be sent to the government analyst because Mr. Ramanayake has denied signing any such letter.
The matter came up again when when Padma Udayashantha Gunasekera raised a supplementary question. Minister S.B. Dissanayake to whom the question was directed said the MP's question had nothing to do with the original question. "Learn to raise oral question in the proper manner he said while using an uncomplimentary word.
The MP raised the matter again a little later with Mr Ramanayake raising a point of order. This was despite repeated requests made by the Speaker that the two MPs should allow the proceedings to continue.
"Raising points of order has become a joke," the Speaker said. (Yohan Perera)

This is due to come as a sequel to a collective complaint made by several prominent members saying that they had found the conduct of a certain mate intolerable and they did not want to play in the same team with him any longer.
According to informed sources, the authorities of the gentlemens game had to press hard these unhappy players to participate in the recent foreign tours and they have now come to believe that a very bleak future is in store for the game unless some changes in the team were made.
The proposed shake-up will witness the removal of the player from his current position as he has now become a thorn in the side of several team members of two senior players will be to lead the test and limited overs teams respectively, they say.

GMOA Assistant Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge told a media briefing that they have discussed the matter with the Joint Opposition members including former president Mahinda Rajapaksa and the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) during recent days.
We have already written to President Maithripala Sirisena on the effects of the ruling directing the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) to register SAITM's MBBS graduates. We have also written to the general secretaries of the SLFP and UNP on the matter, he said.
He said the GMOA had conducted several discussions with state university students, parents and several unions including the Inter University Students Federation (IUSF).
He said the reason behind this open discussion of the matter was Health Minister Rajitha Senaratnes irresponsible behaviour and his SAITM-biased stand; Our aim is to create a strong force against the SAITM and secure the patients' lives as well as the medical field. We are taking every possible step to do so, he added. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)

This politico who made it to Diyawanna through the national list already holds a second level office in the council. He is also having high hopes of joining the top team while holding on to his current high office in the body guiding the popular game.
However, some informed ones are skeptical about the politicos dream coming true. By the way, there are certain legal snags in the way of further increasing the size of the present top team, they say.

Hey, Maithri and Ranil, cast aside your opposition -mindset,  youre in power
	
When avarice takes the lead in a State, it is commonly the forerunner of its fall.
~ Alexander Hamilton
Mahinda Rajapaksa along with the national media, the so-called free media, which was nowhere to be seen during Rajapaksas regime, the media that was under siege time after time under the cruel determinations of the regimes virtual second-in-command, Secretary of Defence, has assumed dimensions disproportionate to the actual, now seems to be controlling the national conversation. Not the government.
The so-called joint opposition, the dregs of the last regime, the group of opposition MPs, some of whose financial and social integrity have come under a barrage of accusations, allegations and investigations and whose integrity is very much under scrutiny and question have taken the fight to the governments front door. They have managed to set the government on the defensive and each and every time, in the parlance of sports, the ball has belonged to the opposition. It is certainly not a very pleasant situation for those who replaced the Rajapaksas.
On the other hand, the platform that the present government, Maithri/Ranil combo and party carried out the campaign on, seems to be crumbling down. The very charge of the then opposition, corruption and nepotism, has crept into the new personalities of the new government. It is time that the government of Maithripala Sirisena and Ranil Wickremesinghe strapped their boots and took the ball into their own hands, so to speak.
Addressing the Progressive Congress Annual Strategy Summit on Saturday, Massachusettss Senator Elizabeth Warren began thus: we are all gathered here in a moment of crisis; a crisis for progressives, a moment of crisis for Democrats and a moment of crisis for America. There is an eternal truth about politics and people. People like Mahinda Rajapaksa dont come to power when things are going right.
The voters, the victims, who put them in power must hold themselves accountable as much as the culprits. The voters simply cannot let themselves off the hook. The Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP), the Common Mans Party, which embraced bigotry and extremism, which embraced the uncommon rich man and his ugly avarice, was hijacked by the Rajapaksas and their loyal henchmen. The Bandaranaikes and Kobbekaduwas are forgotten. The Rajapaksas treated them like yesterdays trash. S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike, with all his political weaknesses and expedient tendencies, kept the party at least away from the political imposters and charlatans. What happened to the SLFP after S.W.R.D.s demise is another story altogether, yet the Rajapaksas have to be taken into account for the destruction of the image of the Common Mans Party. At least for the time being, Maithripala Sirisena appears to have wrested the party away from these political hooligans. But if President Sirisena continues to dilly-dally taking stern disciplinary action against those SLFPers who continue to disregard the party line and go astray, the dissolution of the Common Mans Party is imminent.
This crisis in the SLFP has indeed slowed down Maithripala Sirisena. But he must not allow that predicament to be built up to the level of a national crisis by abdicating his obligations to his voters in particular and his country at large. Failure of the current government will be seen as a landmark failure of the current system of governance. Yahapalanaya or whatever one might call it, it should not be allowed to fail. Accountability and transparency on the part of those who are vested with governmental power cannot be sacrificed for political expediency and administrative convenience. The corrupt practices that have been entrenched in a system for the last three to four decades, particularly the last twenty years will take over the system and overwhelm the national character. It may have already happened and if not, it is on the threshold of happening.
History is our witness. Time after time it has been proven beyond a shadow of doubt that a lethargic, apathetic public is the first cause of national decay. In this regard, the responsibility of the United National Party (UNP), the main coalition partner of the current political administration, cannot be overstated. As a political party which has been maligned and disparaged by its opponents, especially the traditional SLFP, after coming to a historic partnership with the SLFP, today willy-nilly is feeding the urban gossipmongers with enough material to keep its own head above the water level. The ugly image that is being attributed to the UNP and the resulting ill-effects of a politically-explosive financial swindle, such as the so-called Bond-Scam could be devastating both in the short and midterm runs.
Making tactical adjustments, changing talking points, while embracing the same old barren policies and stinking principles would not help the UNP.
Ranil and his cohorts must realise that when the gauntlet tightens, it does not differentiate between the UNPers and SLFPers. Racial extremism stirred up by the Rajapaksas was tolerated by the UNP because they feared the backlash from the Buddhist clergy. It tightens all and sundry - it includes anyone close to the current coalition. The voters will not show any mercy.
At the same time, the voters must be continuously reminded of what they are enjoying today and the negatives of the past regime that they would gladly miss.
Following is a catalogue of such alleged misdeeds:
Computer purchases for Mahindodaya labs in excess of Rs. 5.87 billion.
	Issue of 1,000 diplomatic passports during nine years of rule.
	Three PSD officers: Brig. Capt. and Major in money laundering during the MR regime.
	Transactions of Tourist Board officials: Rs. 5.7 million. 
	SL Insurances re-involvement of a Doctor and ex-Minister.
	State Engineering Corp.: Rs.4.7 million transaction.

A report about the mysterious disappearance of a massive amount of money allocated for the Nilwala River project made sensational news in the recent past.

Many believed at that time that those behind the revelation had targeted the former strongman and those in his inner circle. However, it came to light soon afterwards that the politico responsible for the missing Nilwala project funds was none other than a Blue party senior who threw in his lot with yahapalanaya with an eye on a very high office in it.
Finding his political goal continuing to elude him, the politico had made secret plans to join the Green party while publicly declaring his intention to retire from politics.
In pursuance of his plans, the Blue senior had the other day met on the sly a Green purohita handling public funds at the Borella residence of a businessman helming the Green partys propaganda machinery. A very high political authority, a party leader to boot came to know about the secret powwow within a matter of few hours.
A day or two later the issue relating to missing Nilwala project funds made newspaper headlines again. The Blue senior who was poised for the somersault had immediately called it quits for he realized it was a red signal for him. He is said to be now lying low hoping against hope for a new break.

What was wrong in obtaining a degree from a private university if it was permissible for the medical students to enter State universities by attending to private tuition classes, Welfare Minister S. B. Dissanayake said today.
Social Empowerment and Welfare Minister S. B. Dissanayake told a media briefing that the students who were not eligible to enter State universities could obviously have the ability to obtain a degree through private universities, with the aid of a scholarship or a loan scheme.
The students who are struggling on the roads against the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) on the roads had studied at private tuition classes during Advance Level (A/L) by paying money, he said.
He said he would give his complete support to establish more private medical universities in Sri Lanka like the SAITM if any investor would be interested in doing so. (Kalathma Jaywardhane)

India misread our ties with China: Namal Rajapaksa
	
India misinterpreted the Rajapaksa administrations relationship with China, but is silent on the current governments engagement with the rising super power, Sri Lankan parliamentarian Namal Rajapaksa, the eldest son of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, said.
We always made sure that Sri Lankan soil or waters was not used against any other country. And we maintained that during my fathers time on a strict basis, he told The Hindu in a recent interview.
Formerly a rugby player, he captained the national team, the 30-year-old parliamentarian has since 2010 represented the southern district of Hambantota. Considered a stronghold of the Rajapaksas, Hambantota houses a $1.5-million port that the former President built with Chinese loans. The Hambantota port was initially offered to India, but they did not get back. China came forward, he said. We cant wait because we have to look at our peoples interests first and our election promises to them.
Emphasising that their government was not against India or China, or any other country, Mr. Rajapaksa said they merely put the countrys interest first. Whoever was interested in investing, we went and worked with them. However, Indias silence now on the governments agreements with China, he said, gave credence to popular belief among Sri Lankans that the West and India got together to topple his fathers government in January 2015.
Deeming the Hambantota port and a nearby airport, also built during President Rajapaksas time, white elephants, the current government  led by President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe  decided to sell an 80% stake of the port to a Chinese company to cut the countrys debt burden.
Additionally, the government is also mulling leasing 15,000 acres of land to Chinese companies for an industrial zone that, the government says, would create 1 lakh jobs. The project, according to Mr. Rajapaksa, threatens to displace thousands. It will have a huge social impact, he said.
Accusing the government of political vendetta, particularly in regard to corruption cases facing the former First family, he said: I am not against investigations, but I am just saying do it properly. The lawmaker was arrested twice last year for alleged money laundering and misappropriation of funds, and is currently on bail.
On the 2012 case of rugby star Wasim Thajudeens death, in which the CID recently questioned two higher ranking army officials part of former President Rajapaksas security detail, Namal Rajapaksa said the initial medical reports had clearly stated it was an accident.
The CID, which took over the case in 2015, told the court it was a murder after Thajudeens body was exhumed and re-examined, a charge that Mr. Rajapaksa finds politically motivated. Senior ministers in the Sirisena government have linked the former Presidents two sons, Namal and Yositha, to the murder case, a charge that Rajapaksa has denied.

Syrias army and its allies advanced towards the northern Islamic-State held city on Monday, cutting off the last main supply route that connects to militant strongholds further east towards Iraq. 
Islamic State militants are now effectively besieged in the area, by the army from the south and by Turkish-backed rebels from the north, as Damascus and Ankara race to capture the largest IS stronghold in Aleppo province. 
Al-Bab is now completely besieged by the regime from the south, and the Turkish forces and rebels from the east, north and west, said the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. It came after the regimes forces and allied militia seized the only and last main road used by the jihadists between Al-Bab and Raqqa, Observatory chief Rami Abdel Rahman said, referring to the jihadists de facto capital in Syria. 
The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a British-based group monitoring the war, said the army and the Lebanese Hezbollah group made gains southeast of al-Bab overnight. 
Backed by air strikes, government forces and their allies severed the main road that linked the city near the Turkish border to other ISIS-held territory in Raqqa and Deir al-Zor provinces.

Israel passes bill to seize private Palestinian land for Jewish settlements
	

By William Booth
(c) 2017, The Washington Post   
JERUSALEM - Israels parliament passed a contentious law late Monday that allows the state to seize land privately owned by Palestinians in the West Bank and grant the properties to Jewish settlements for their exclusive use. 
The measure is designed to protect homes in Jewish settlements, built on private Palestinian property in good faith or at the states instruction, from possible court-ordered evacuation and demolition. 
Thousands of homes in dozens of settlements and outposts may now be protected, at least temporarily. The bill is likely headed for a high court challenge. 
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu supports the legislation and has told his constituents that no government had done more for the settlers. On Monday, the Israeli leader said he had informed the Trump White House that a vote on the legislation was imminent. 
Israeli legislators in the opposition condemned the bill as reckless and warned that it would turn the world against Israel while goading prosecutors at the International Criminal Court in The Hague to take action against the Jewish state. 
The bill passed on a vote of 60 to 52. 
The private Palestinian land would be seized by the government and held until there is a final resolution of the decades-long Israel-Palestinian conflict. Palestinian landowners could apply to the state for annual rents or be given another parcel. 
A member of parliament in Netanyahus own Likud party, Benny Begin, son of the former Prime Minister Menachem Begin, speaking before the vote, labeled it the robbery bill. 
Another Likud legislator, former justice minister Dan Meridor, condemned the bill as evil and dangerous. 
Meridor, a lawyer, warned the Israeli parliament that the West Bank remains under a belligerent occupation, 50 years after Israel won the territory from Jordan in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war. Palestinians who live in the territory are not Israeli citizens. They dont vote in Israeli elections. They live under a military authority. 
If Israels parliament legislates for the Palestinians - rather than control them by military rule - then Palestinians would have the right to become citizens and vote in Israel, Meridor argued. 
Dont cross a line weve never crossed before, Meridor pleaded with his fellow legislators in a newspaper column. No government in Israel has applied its sovereignty to the West Bank. 
The Palestinian Authority said the measure was an illegal land grab. Former Palestinian peace negotiator Saeb Erekat compared the Israelis to looters.

Jayasuriya calls for a long term strategy
	
Chairman of National Cricket Selectors Sanath Jayasuriya urged local cricket authorities to work out a long term strategy which will help players perform better outside their comfort zone.
Jayasuriya, a legendary Sri Lankan cricketer admitted that Sri Lankans have historically struggled in South African conditions but said he was disappointed by how tamely the players squandered their chances.
We should be able to play under any conditions, not just at home. Theres no point giving excuses or blaming our domestic structure after we lose a series. Its just that the players did not adjust to these conditions. Your success depend on how fast you adjust to these conditions but sadly we have taken too long to do that, explained Jayasuriya.We need to prepare ourselves better, not that we dont, but we need to find out whether we need a longer period of preparations for tours like this. Whether we need to come here early and prepare is something that we should really look at, he added.
Sri Lanka lost the Test series 0-3, four years after they won their first ever win in South African soil and now faces a 5-0 whitewash in the five-match one-day series.
Sri Lanka managed to win the T20 series but it came against a second -string South Africa side, after hosts decided to rest most of their big guns to keep them fresh for the ODI series.
If we can do a player programme at least at the Under-19 level that will do a world of good for the players. We sent Kusal Mendis to England and we all know how well he performed in England last year, he said.
We have seen South African players being sent to India to get use to spin wickets. This is one area we could really look at in the future, he added.
A similar sentiment was shared by Coach Graham Ford following the Test series defeat.
Another option may be to try and get young lads on exchange programmes to these countries and give them time to develop, Ford said.
Sri Lanka have done decently in English conditions and Jayasuriya believes, the county experience of Sri Lanka cricketers have played a major role in the success.
Look we have done well in English conditions. We have won Test and ODI series there. This is because our cricketers are more accustomed to those conditions. Lot of our cricketers used to play in counties in the past and that experience has helped the team, Jayasuriya said.
Sri Lankas top scorer in ODI cricket, Jayasuriya admitted that the results so far were a bitter pill to swallow and should need urgent attention.
We really need to find a way to play outside of our comfort zone. We do better in our own conditions and win matches, but when we go out, we struggle. If we dont change this situation fast, we will only be winning matches at home, he further said.
Jayasuriya also admitted that Sri Lanka at present is short of cricketers with extra-ordinary talent which the islanders have regularly produced in the past.
I wouldnt say theres a dearth of talent but we dont produce those champion cricketers as much as we did in the past. I dont think its a problem with the domestic structure or the school structure, because its the very system that produced all those champion cricketers in the past. So, we need to assess this situation and find out where the problem is and correct it, he added.
The problem I see here is not lack of talent but their inability to adjust quickly to situations and handle the pressure. You cant play cricket, if you cant absorb pressure.
Jayasuriya also said that the selectors had kept high hopes on Dinesh Chandimal and Lahiri Thirimanne to make the transition smooth after several high profile retirements, but neither has established their positions.
Thirimanne has been dropped out of the National Team while Chandimal now faces a similar fate having gone through a miserable form with the bat in South Africa. He was dropped for the fourth ODI played yesterday after he had failed to score a single 50 plus score in 12 innings.
We had lot of hopes on these two players but they are currently struggling. They have played enough cricket to establish themselves, he explained.
Jayasuriya also complimented his former opening partner Upul Tharanga who is currently standing-in for the injured Skipper Angelo Mathews for his leadership qualities.
Sadly he lost about two years of cricket but right now he is playing really well and also as a leader is getting the boys together. I am sure he has lot more to offer for the game, he said.(Champika Fernando in Cape Town)

JO defends scholarships given to students to enter SAITM
	
The Joint Opposition (JO) today defended the awarding of full scholarships to students to study medical degree offered by SAITM during the previous governments tenure.
Addressing the weekly news briefing Prof. G.L. Peiris said awarding a scholarship to study a degree was different from recognizing the degree as an authenticated profession.
He made these remarks as a response to a question whether it was appropriate to award scholarships to study in a university when the medical degree was not accredited by the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC).
On Tuesday, a Fundamental Rights petition filed by two medical students of SAITM was fixed for support on March 27 by the Supreme Court.
The students including one who was recommended by the former government for a full scholarship to follow the MBBS Degree at SAITM had sought a declaration to null and void a Medical Service Minute issued in 2014 by the Public Service Commission recommending that only graduates of State universities and foreign universities are eligible to join the government service.
The then Higher Education Minister gave the scholarship on two conditions. The conditions made to improve the quality of the university have not been fulfilled so far by SAITM. The SLMC repeatedly said the SAITM medical degree was not accepted. Even the then Health Minister Maithripala Sirisena said the ministry doesnt accept the private universitys medical degree, he said.
He said awarding scholarships was not a measure of hoodwinking anyone as both the government and the scholarship recipients were aware the fact that the SAITMs medical degree was not accepted by SLMC.
The Professor said a 10-member committee was appointed by SLMC in 2015 to look into the standard of the private university at Malabe and the committee had recommended that the training offered throughout the degree programme was insufficient.
He said Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne who is liable to implement the SLMC recommendations, had not taken any steps with regard to the recommendations so far.
The Minister is bound to implement the recommendations on the SAITM made by the SLMC. All he has to do is to take the matter in Parliament and then issue an order to implement these recommendations. Parliament cant move away from the responsibility as this is a matter which has an impact on the entire health sector and the country, he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

## Title: Laws to provide better conditions for captive elephants

Laws to provide better conditions for captive elephants
	
The government has approved a draft of laws to regulate how elephants are kept, including banning the use of animals under the age of five for work, the Deutsche Welle (DW) reported yesterday.
It was reported that they had also ensured animals walk a minimum distance each day and get an improved diet of fresh fruit and vegetables. Authorities also announced Pinnawala orphanage, one of the countrys popular tourist attractions, will no longer place orphaned animals in zoos, aiming to avoid a repeat of the Auckland incident.
Sri Lanka's Department of Wildlife Conservation did not to respond to DW's request for an interview, but says the new measures will improve life for elephants in captivity, according to AFP.
Conservationists hope it will provide better protection for elephants that were not covered under the country's existing animal welfare legislation. Still, they worry that it may not be easy to enforce the laws due to a lack of will and the fear that prosecuting offenders would expose political connections, it said.
The full article;
Baby elephants have become the must-have status symbol for Sri Lanka's wealthy. The government has introduced new laws to protect them. But conservationists believe more action is needed to end mistreatment.
Diplomatic gifts between countries can, like most presents, either be a fitting gesture or cause unintended controversy. The donation in 2015 of two baby elephants from the country's Pinnawala orphanage by the Sri Lankan prime minister to his New Zealand counterpart very much falls into the latter category.
The seemingly innocent gift provoked so much outrage from animal rights' groups in Sri Lanka that the move of one of the baby elephants - five-year-old Ninda - to Auckland Zoo was put on hold. Critics said it would be cruel to separate the animal from its herd at such a young age.
Both countries have now seen a change in leadership, but the episode is symbolic of a wider debate about a practice in Sri Lanka that has been criticized by animal welfare groups. That is the penchant of the wealthy classes for buying baby elephants rather than expensive watches and cars as status symbols.
"Many new rich families are attempting to improve their social status by having an elephant. The babies are never discarded when they grow up but are retained since they continue to be a status symbol," Jayanthe Jayewardene, a Sri-Lanka based elephant expert and a managing trustee of the Biodiversity and Elephant Conservation Trust, told DW.
Conservationists say the desire for baby elephants presents problems for the animals on two fronts: welfare and diminishing wild populations.
'Breaking in'
Elephants can be found everywhere in Sri Lanka, from the sun-dappled beaches to its mountainous and lush interior. That's partly because the species found in the country generally don't have tusks and have largely been spared the global killing spree for ivory.
In marked contrast to countries such as Thailand, the wild population of an estimated 6,000-7,000 elephants heavily outweighs the captive one. Still, given the latter is officially only around 250, critics suspect animals are being plucked from the wild population, which is already under pressure due to habitat destruction and human-animal conflict, to supply the pet market. At least 40 elephants are believed to have been taken illegally in recent years. This is despite a ban on capturing wild animals in Sri Lanka.
Prithiviraj Fernando, a scientist and the chairman of the Sri Lankan-based Centre for Conservation and Research says another major problem with taking animals from the wild is that any domestication process will likely be cruel.
"Traditional domestication involves 'breaking in' the animal In this process elephants are usually starved and beaten and then rewarded, he told DW.
And given the close family bonds central to elephant life, the seized individuals are not the only ones to suffer.
"The relationship between mothers and babies are as strong as or even stronger than the bonding and relationships between human mothers and their babies," Jayewardene says. "When the mother is separated from its baby, the mother suffers emotional stress and makes valiant efforts to reunite."
The government wants to regulate how elephants are to be kept - one rules says that elephants younger than 5 years are not allowed to work.
Old habits die hard...
Captive animals are often either kept in private homes, government-run orphanages or owned by masters known as mahouts who rent them out for practices such as highly controversial tourist rides.
But the practice of taming elephants in Sri Lanka goes back much further than the current tastes of the newly rich. Pachyderms have been used in religious ceremonies for centuries and are often resident in Buddhist temples.
Still, the animal welfare advocates say that while elephants have been used for cultural and religious purposes and captivity for hundreds of years, the treatment of them is often poor. Shackling, for instance, is common practice.
"Tame elephants are kept in chains of varying lengths. However long the chain that shackles an elephant may be, it does not afford the freedom that an elephant needs," Jayewardene says. "An elephant that lives in the wild walks around 15 kilometers a day."
A series of confiscations and arrests made in 2016 included that of a Buddhist monk, whose high-profile trial underlined the mistreatment elephants are believed to suffer when kept for use in religious ceremonies. But even when they are treated well, the wild is a better option, say some.
"Just because an animal is kept in a certain way does not mean that way is good for their welfare," Chris Draper, the associate director for animal welfare and care with the Born Free Foundation told DW.
More action needed...
The government has approved a raft of laws to regulate how elephants are kept, including banning the use of animals under five for work, and ensuring animals walk a minimum distance each day and get an improved diet of fresh fruit and vegetables. Authorities also announced Pinnawala orphanage, one of the countrys popular tourist attractions, will no longer place orphaned animals in zoos, aiming to avoid a repeat of the Auckland incident.
Sri Lanka's Department of Wildlife Conservation did not to respond to DW's request for an interview, but says the new measures will improve life for elephants in captivity, according to AFP. Conservationists hope it will provide better protection for elephants that were not covered under the country's existing animal welfare legislation. Still, they worry that it may not be easy to enforce the laws due to a lack of will and the fear that prosecuting offenders would expose political connections.
"No amount of legislation can prevent illegal activities if people are willing to break the law," Prithiviraj Fernando says. "It is good to have significant penalties, but the more important thing is to impose them. One way around this is to have public oversight of captive elephants."
Setting an example...
The Elephant Transit Home in Udawalawe National Park is trying to set an example of how orphaned animals can be reintegrated to the wild. Unlike in other orphanages, animals are very rarely put into captivity. Instead, they are released into a large facility in the park, free of shackles and in social groups.
"How they [elephants] are kept can be changed quite drastically," says Manori Gunawardena of Sri Lanka's Born Free Foundation, which co-runs the home. "Instead of having solitary animals chained up all day, they should be kept in a social environment."

New laws allocating separate areas for protests
	
New laws will be introduced with regard to protests soon, Minister of Law and Order Sagala Ratnayake informed Parliament yesterday.
Minister Ratnayake who was speaking during an adjournment debate in the House said the government will introduce new laws while safeguarding the peoples right of association and expression which are guaranteed by the Constitution.
He said the police will be trained more professionally to handle protests and civil disturbances.
MP S. M. Marikkar who moved the adjournment debate earlier called for allocating separate areas for protests. Continuous protests will discourage investors and will damage the reputation of the country. Therefore, arrangements should be made to allocate separate areas for protests while safeguarding the rights of the people, he said while highlighting that several countries have implemented a system where separate areas are allocated for mass protests.
Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) MP Dr. Nalinda Jayatissa said his party is opposed to this move as it is a violation of peoples rights. He said the Constitution have guaranteed the right of the people to convene in any location and express their ideas. He said allocation of special locations for protests will violate this right.(Yohan Perera)

SAITM shooting: Attempt to divert mounting protest JVP
	
The Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) today alleged that the government was attempting to put the blame of the shooting at the SAITM CEO on the student unions and civil society groups and urged it to conduct a broad investigation over the incident and reveal the culprits.
JVP leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake said the SAITM issue should not be allowed to be suppressed through this sort of drama.
The government is trying to put the blame on the student unions and civil society groups over the SAITM shooting. The UNP government had done this sort of actions such as the 1983 Black July in the past to suppress forces against them. They even acted to ban political parties hiding behind the incident. This shooting also indicates a similar story. Therefore we urge the government to conduct a broad investigation and reveal the culprits, he said.
Mr. Dissanayake said the governments involvement in the incident would be justified if the government failed to conduct an investigation and revealed the people behind the incident.
This should be revealed if there was no government blessed force behind this. Our Police Department was clever to find any type of crime. The government was behind the crimes that the police have not been able to solve including the cases of Wasim Thajudeen and Lasantha Wickramatunge, he said.
Mr. Dissanayake told a news conference that they had reasonable doubt that the SAITM may be doing this sort of actions to divert the mounting protest over it after the verdict of the Court of Appeal. (Ajith Siriwardana)

The Government should give some space to establish private universities such as SAITM in the country as all the school leavers couldnt be enrolled into State Universities; Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam said today addressing media at the Ministry.
Minister Kariyawasam said he was the only person to adjourn a debate in Parliament against SAITM.
Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa was the person who brought SITAM to the country and we are adopting his baby. I rose against SITAM in Parliament to bring it up to a certain quality and standard, he said.
If private universities agreed to maintain quality as the Government stipulates there is no objection to providing lands for them, he said.
Two Medical Universities would be established in Kuliyapitiya and Sabaragamuwa. Rs. 2 billion had already being funded by the government for the construction of the Sabaragamuwa medical university.
According to international standards, there should be a certain number of doctors for certain size of population. Unfortunately we havent reached that level yet, he said.
Establishing private universities will help stop flowing foreign exchange to other countries, he said. (Chaturanga Pradeep)

Start preparing for financial independence, advises NDB Wealth
	
Having marked Sri Lankas Independence Day, its time to start preparing for your own financial independence. Meaning different things to different people, financial independence can, for example, result in being debt free or even having a sufficient amount set aside to meet any emergency. Another way to look at it, make your assets effectively work for you, by consistently continuing to generate an income in excess of your expenses.
Mainly, the need for financial independence is much greater during periods of global or local uncertainty. Today, many who can see retirement fast approaching do not have a proper plan so they can meet it with adequate peace of mind. In fact, according to NDB Wealths Financial Advisor Christina Wesley, nine out of 10 people are worried about how long their savings will last once they retire, with a further eight, out of 10 concerned that they will never accrue enough to fully give up work once they reach the retirement age.
Wesley also revealed that there are two important elements to securing financial independence: increasing your assets and reducing your expenses. While a simple lifestyle will help you manage your expenses, accumulating assets requires knowledge and foresight. Further, accounting for complexities such as taxes, pensions, etc. make the whole process even more complicated, requiring expert advice to navigate the numerous potential pitfalls of any decision you make.
Many have intimated to us that they need to take control of their finances to feel more secure about their future. The financial advisors at NDB Wealth are trained to listen to your worries and come up with plans that will take care of your specific concerns. Being smart about your money from the start can also mean being able to retire early, if you want, signalled Wesley.
NDB Wealth additionally provides a number of very simple, introductory plans that help you easily take on the responsibility of building wealth. NDB Wealth allows you to maximise your savings and income beyond the limitations of traditional banking, by initiating clients into high-performance instruments such as money market funds. Plans such as Retirement Savings and Retirement Income, both offered by NDB Wealth, can provide avenues to improve your long-term financial independence. Regular, yet manageable, amounts of savings deployed in a smart way can help build significant quantity of wealth in the future. But you need to start planning and saving for your retirement today itself, added Wesley.
Also, she advises that you should always consult an investment adviser and/or tax consultant prior to making any investment decision.

Trumps moral blind spot
	

(c) 2017, The Washington Post 
Of all the strangely accommodating remarks President Donald Trump has made about Russian President Vladimir Putin, none is quite so startling and pernicious as his suggestion that the United States is morally equivalent to a ruthless regime whose critics keep getting murdered. For all its flaws, the United States is fundamentally different from the Russia of Putin, whose relentless pursuit of hegemony over his neighbors and the degradation of the West is founded in cynicism. Every U.S. president prior to Trump has embraced a contrary vision of American exceptionalism in which the country serves as a beacon of democracy, human rights and the rule of law. For Trump to casually equate the two is as false as it is shocking. 

Trump was interviewed by the Fox News commentator Bill OReilly for a broadcast just before the Super Bowl. OReilly brought up Russia, and pithily declared: But hes a killer, though. Putins a killer. 
OReilly may have been referring to the many critics of Putin and his regime who have died in the past 17 years, including the opposition leader Boris Nemtsov, shot in the back near the walls of the Kremlin in 2015; anti-corruption investigator Sergei Magnitsky, who died in prison in 2009; former KGB man Alexander Litvinenko, poisoned with polonium in 2006; respected journalist Anna Politkovskaya, shot the same year; and journalist Yuri Shchekochikhin, thought to have been poisoned in 2003. In these cases and others, arrests have sometimes been made of the person who carried out the killing but not of those who ordered it. 
Trump replied, There are a lot of killers. Weve got a lot of killers. Well, you think our countrys so innocent. You think our countrys so innocent

OReilly: I dont know of any government leaders that are killers. 
Trump: Well - take a look at what weve done, too. We made a lot of mistakes. Ive been against the war in Iraq from the beginning. 
OReilly: But mistakes are
different than -  
Trump: A lot of mistakes, but a lot of people were killed. A lot of killers around, believe me. 
To state the obvious, in the United States, critics of the president are not poisoned or gunned down. By suggesting that U.S. military operations in Iraq - a country the George W. Bush administration invaded to depose a blood-soaked dictator - are equivalent to such crimes, Trump repudiates the very notion of a foreign policy based on values. He equates the forces of liberty and thuggery - and thereby validates strongmen everywhere who rule by coercion, suffocate free speech and crush individual dignity. 
The United States is, of course, far from perfect: Its history includes dark chapters both at home and abroad. But as President Barack Obama observed, American exceptionalism lies in its elevated aspirations, and in the nations capacity to reverse its errors through democratic reform. Rather than embrace that tradition, Trumps rhetoric suggests he will mimic Putin in the naked pursuit of narrow interests and disregard for legality and morality. It is a doctrine that leaders of both parties, along with ordinary Americans, should repudiate.

Two wrongs do not make a right: VAC
	
The financial misappropriation allegedly committed by former Central Bank (CB) governor Arjun Mahendran could not be swept under the carpet just because he alleged that his predecessor was also involved in such misappropriations, Voice Against Corruption (VAC) today charged.
In response to the claims made by Mr. Mahendran, VAC Convener Wasantha Samarasinghe told the Daily Mirror that the audit report prepared by the CB's Internal Audit Department was an annual report surveyed under several investigations and added that further steps should be taken against him based on this report.
The audit report has clearly denoted that Mr. Mahendran had spent Rs. 66mn of CB funds for his own purpose on 163 occasions during a span of 21 months for personal purposes. There are evidences such as bills and invoices to prove the fact, he said.
He said Mr. Mahendran could not avoid the allegations against him by referring to the former rulers. He also said the other frauds also should be revealed if the former rulers have also engaged in such matters.
Earlier, the VAC has revealed that Mr. Mahendarn failed to produce valid invoices for the 163 occasions he had either purchased goods for himself or had paid hotel bills and on one occasion he was known to have bought a blazer for Rs. 2,000, 000.
However, while rejecting these claims Mr. Mahendran, in a statement to the media, on Tuesday said a group of disgruntled CB employees closely allied with a former governor lobbied for his removal because he cancelled all the tamashas and excessive foreign travel enjoyed by a few of his selected cronies.
These statements are libellous in the extreme. They are based on extremely dubious and unverified sources, he added. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)
