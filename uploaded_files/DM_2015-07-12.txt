I have neither here nor there now: Somawansa
	
Former Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) leader Somawansa Amarasinghe has decided not to contest the upcoming general elections and withdrawn from the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to form the United National Front for Good-Governance with the UNP, JHU and some SLFP breakaways.
Speaking to Daily Mirror, he said he would never collaborate with the UNP despite his losing a chance to contest the elections.
Amarasinghe had earlier decided to join Pivithuru Hetak National Council chairman the Ven. Athuraliye Rathana Thera to contest the elections.
However, since the JHU had signed an MoU with the UNP, Amarasinghe said he had no party to contest from.
We could not form a new party as we had planned to, due to the rules of the Elections Department. My plan was to collaborate with the Pivithuru Hetak organisation. But today I came to know they had joined up with the UNP, which I have been criticising for a long time over their misdeeds and offences. How can I work with the UNP if I have self-respect he asked.
He said if he joined the United National Front for Good Governance, he would become a joke to the JVP.
I am neither here nor there now. I have no party to contest from. I will have to wait until the next elections, he said.
The former JVP leader had quit the JVP and vowed to form a new front from which he said he could serve the people in a way the JVP had failed to do. (Piyumi Fonseka)

MRs nomination has benefited the UNP: Minister
	
Former president Mahinda Rajapaksas nomination to contest the general election benefited the United National Party (UNP), Minister John Amaratunga said today.
He said many SLFP front-liner including ministers had decided to join the UNP but had missed out on the nominations because by that time the list of candidates had been finalised.
The minister told a media briefing at the UNP headquarters, Sirikotha that President Maithripala Sirisenas decision to satisfy the SLFP by giving nomination to the former president has directly and indirectly benefited the UNP.
Some say the President thought it better for the SLFP if Mr. Rajapaksa was allowed to contest the election while some say he will not be allowed to contest elections though given nominations. We dont care whether Mr. Rajapaksa contests or does not contest because either way the UNP will be benefitted, he said. (Piyumi Fonseka)
