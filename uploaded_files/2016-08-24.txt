Coal Controversy: USD 3mn loss in public funds?
	
The controversial Coal Tender process has taken a different turn with the Power and Energy Ministry deciding to continue to purchase coal from Swiss Singapore despite damning observations by the Supreme Court.
The issue came to light last year after the Daily Mirror broke the story regarding the circumventing of procedure and process in awarding a sport tender to the same company. Thereafter legal action was filed in the Supreme Court, which observed a blatant violation of the process when awarding the tender.
The decision comes despite the Power and Energy Ministry was said to have been ?taken aback? last week when the spot tender they called for coal had the lowest price for this commodity at USD 64.77 per metric tonne. However, it was reported on Monday (22), according to Ministry Secretary Dr. B.M.S Batagoda, that the Power and Energy Ministry would continue to contract with Swiss Singapore Overseas Enterprises Pte Limited for the supply of coal. The reason given for this has been that their contract price was USD 7 less than what was quoted in a recent spot tender at USD 58 per metric tonne.
However, the Daily Mirror learns that in order to arrive at the complete price which has to be paid to Swiss Singapore the calculations have to be made according to an API 4 Index. This figure does not seem to have been taken into account in classifying Swiss Singapore as the best option because had it been accounted for, the calculations would have shown that the long term tender with this company would have resulted in USD 9.17 more per metric tonne than what would have been spent using the spot tender method.
This in turn translates into an excessive spending of USD 3,026,100 for the required 330,000 metric tonnes of coal in September.
The figures given by the Power and Energy Ministry has also been questioned publicly by Wasantha Samarasinghe of the Voice Against Corruption Movement.
Furthermore the continuation to contract with Swiss Singapore flies in the face of the concerns that were raised by the Supreme Court of Sri Lanka after this controversy that has racked the local coal industry was brought to light by fundamental rights petitions that were filed by two other coal suppliers.
K. Sripavan, C.J, in his judgement on the case said ?I have no alternative but to declare the decision of the SCAPC (Standing Cabinet Appointed Procurement Committee) to award the tender to the 22nd Respondent (Swiss Singapore) cannot stand valid in the eye of the law.? In its judgment the Chief Justice also observed that some events which took place in the award of the coal tender to Swiss Singapore Overseas Enterprises Pte Ltd ?shocks the conscience of the Court?
The applications were dismissed however due to preliminary objections that were raised. (Rashmin Tirimanne De Silva)

Ministry Sec. denies: Individual vehicle importers barred from Finance Ministry
	
The newly formed individual vehicle importers, who were affected due to the recent tax increase said yesterday that they were barred from entering the Finance Ministry office over any vehicle importation related issues by Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake since June 17.
However, the Finance Ministry Media Secretary Sisira Wijesinghe contradicted the allegations and said the individual importers had imported the vehicles even though they were aware of the tax increase. He also denied the claim about barring the importers from meeting the Minister.
He said that the increase of vehicle tax had been taken after a Cabinet decision and it cannot be changed.
?Many people think the Minister can make changes if they meet him in person. Even the decision on Customs Act cannot be changed by the Minister".
The Collectives President Sujeewa Perera said their association had discussed the issues relating to the release of their individually imported vehicles with the Finance Minister.
?The tax had not been increased only by this Government, but several times during the previous regime as well. The minister had never barred anyone entering the Ministry to discuss any issues with the Minister.
?People can meet the Minister during his public day. Other than that, in case of emergency, relevant Ministry Consultant can be contacted and can make an appointment with the Minister.
?We request the President and the Finance Minister to look into our matter in a reasonable manner and provide us a relief by releasing our vehicles. There are nearly 50 vehicles with the Customs. During the previous regime the relief had been given five times to the people,? he said.
?Before that we have informed President Maithripala Sirisena to provide us concessionary relief to the vehicles. The President had agreed to provide us relief and issued a letter to the Finance Minister to do the needful. But the Finance Minister didn?t even consider the President?s letter and ignored it. He even prevented us entering to premises to discuss any vehicle issues,? he said.
?Not considering the Presidents letter is an insult to the President,? Mr. Perera said.
The Government increased the import duties on several categories of vehicles since March 26.
?We have opened Letters of Credit (LC) to import vehicles before March 27 with the assurance of releasing vehicles under the previous tax and also may have obtained maximum bank loans to support the purchase of these vehicles.
?The new duty is unbearable. We have to pay more than Rs.4 million to release our vehicles from the Customs,? he said.
?There are 200 vehicles to be released by the customs but the people who were able to pay Rs.200,000 or Rs.300,00 were released.
?About 50 vehicles such as Toyota Prius, Mitsubishi Outlander and Nissan X-Trail are still being kept at the Customs. Those vehicles were at the Customs vehicles yard for more than three months and now we have to pay demurrage of nearly Rs.500,000 in addition to the duties. Most of the individual importers had received the letters from Customs saying that the Customs had decided to auction them,? he said. (Chaturanga Pradeep)

## Title: Setting the stage for a new paradigm in banking with HNB

Setting the stage for a new paradigm in banking with HNB
	
HNB CEO outlines visionary new strategic plan for one of Sri Lanka?s oldest banks
Halfway into 2016 and one of the leading players in the Sri Lankan banking sector, Hatton National Bank PLC (HNB) continues to record impressive growth rates, well above industry averages, across all key performance indicators (KPIs). Having consistently set industry benchmarks through its innovative product portfolio and unparalleled service delivery, HNB is paving the way for a new paradigm in banking through the adoption of cutting-edge technology aimed at disrupting conventional thinking and forging vibrant new avenues of growth. Leading the charge on this groundbreaking initiative, HNB CEO Jonathan Alles outlined his ambitious new vision for his organisation. Following are excerpts:
Could you describe the current positioning of HNB within the banking industry and the impact of that position in terms of the bank?s more recent performance?
HNB continues to command respect within our industry and the country as a whole. Our legacy as one of the best banks in Sri Lanka is a product of consistent refinement and innovation in terms of our product portfolio and superior customer service, complemented by a substantial emphasis on the integration of cutting-edge technology.?
The success of our approach has been amply demonstrated by our financial performance, most recently in the form of our results for the first half of 2016 when we were able to achieve a 54 percent year-on-year (YoY) increase in profit after tax, reaching Rs.7 billion despite the relatively low levels of credit growth. This strong performance was on the back of 2015?s outstanding results where we were able to cross Rs.10 billion in profits during the year ? the highest on record for the bank.?
Diligent management of fundamentals is another crucial aspect of HNB?s continuing success. The composition of our loan book enabled the bank to improve its interest margins through repricing while our cost-income ratio was cut by nearly 300 bps YoY to 45.2 percent.
Considering that we were able to significantly revise staff salaries during this time, our reduction in costs stands out as one of several clear examples of the kind of efficiency gains possible through careful strategic planning and execution. Similarly, our non-performing assets ratio dropped to just 2.25 percent - another indicator of our superior asset quality.?
All of these achievements have translated into a strong Return on equity and return on assets, which stood at 19.4 percent and 1.7 percent, respectively.?
While we are greatly encouraged by these results, we also remain cognizant of our need to always look to the future.?
?
What are some examples of this type of technological development and what can we expect in the future??
HNB has always been on the frontlines in terms of technology. Wherever we have been able to identify a tangible benefit to the early adoption of new technologies, we have aggressively pursued them and in most if not all cases, HNB has been the first to introduce such innovations to the domestic market.?
A recent example of our attitude towards technology can be seen in the notable upgrades to our electronic banking proposition. This has enabled distributor and supplier financing facilities as well as online trade financing and payment, cash management and other valued services for corporates and SMEs alike.?
We were the first to introduce an Augmented Reality mobile app to Sri Lanka that allows customers to quickly and conveniently get up-to-date on our products, services and special offers and assistance finding the nearest HNB branch or ATM.?
Similarly we introduced our New World Banking Virtual Reality Experience utilizing the latest Oculus Rift technology, allowing our Sri Lankans to take their first steps into a virtual bank for the first time in?
Sri Lanka. ??
These new technologies have significant enterprise level applications and we are working closely with our external partners to develop products that move Sri Lanka towards a more sophisticated digital payment ecosystem. For example: our mobile Point of Sales system Momo is paving the way for a new crop of entrepreneurs to freely and affordably transact with debit and credit cards. ?? ?
Between the well-spring of content, products, services and ideas facilitated by the Internet and the sophisticated wireless, augmented and virtual reality technologies, we have been afforded a truly unprecedented opportunity to forge more personalised relationships with our customers. The potential for technology to revolutionize our business has never been greater. Our goal is to be at the vanguard of this technological revolution.?
?
How important is the human element towards reaching the goals that you have set out??
One of our main challenges is one of human resources. We need to ensure that our key positions are filled by the right people who are passionate and motivated to succeed. In that context, we have already made excellent progress building a high-performance team that we are confident will be able to power the next phase of growth for the bank.?
Significant efforts are being channelled towards providing our team with the training and skills required to build competencies in their respective verticals. We have also implemented an aggressive succession plan, which is focused around developing our existing talent pool in order to groom the next generation of leaders for HNB.?
Moving beyond training and development, we are developing an approach that emphasizes talent management. In this manner we aim to ensure that each member of the HNB team - from my own position as CEO and below ? clearly understands our vision and possesses the required capacity to effectively achieve their deliverables.?
Incentive also plays an important role and our team is among the highest rewarded in the industry. Strong performers are rewarded well above industry standards while similar efforts are also made to develop sales incentive programmes.?
What are the main dynamics driving the type of changes that you have described at HNB?
Our development is fundamentally linked to the development of the Sri Lankan economy as a whole. When we first established operations, the Sri Lankan economy almost completely focused on agriculture and plantations.?
In the century that has since passed, the face of the Sri Lankan economy has changed at practically every level to the point where today, it is the services and industrial sectors that provide the largest contribution to national GDP.?
Hence, it is imperative that HNB too must change and adapt in order to ensure that we don?t just survive, but instead serve as a catalyst for growth and development across all sectors. It is no longer enough to focus only on consolidating our market share and carrying on with a ?business as usual? attitude.?
The initiatives that we have initiated are intended to lay a foundation for a radically different approach to banking that will place the customer at the very centre of our operations, enabling them to reach out through any channel they wish to conveniently and intuitively acquire the banking products, services and advise they need to achieve their own goals in life. Our task is to manage this transition and position HNB to be the preferred partner in that journey. ? ?
?
From a macroeconomic perspective, what are some of the main challenges to achieving your vision??
From a local perspective, there have been many issues related to management of budget deficits, the profitability of state-owned enterprises and development within the SME sector that require urgent attention. We need to be decisive and consistent in the formation and implementation of public policy in order to build confidence in the national economy.
? ?
The good news is that the government has been able to get the ball rolling on some of these fronts and as we work to sustainably develop the Sri Lankan economy, there are many low-hanging fruits we can target to help us achieve our ultimate goals.?
It is important to increase our tax revenue and bring in new tax streams in order to ease the burden on its more traditional sources of tax revenue. I would also call upon the government to continue with its highly commendable efforts to bring in good governance and streamline the bureaucratic process.
?
Education is another crucial area. We must create opportunities for our youth ? particularly in the case of women - to gain access to quality education and equip them with the skills needed to participate in an economy that will be dominated by IT. ?Our efforts as a nation must be directed towards the creation of an effective policy framework to address the difficult challenges we face today. This will require new kinds of leadership and co-operation between the public and private sectors.

The endorsement of the Bill to set up the Office of the Missing Persons (OMP) sans submitted amendments was a grave error, which could lead to negative repercussions, the Jathika Hela Urumaya (JHU) charged today.
JHU National Organiser Nishantha Sri Warnasinghe said it had been reported that Speaker Karu Jayasuriya had placed his signature to the OMP Bill without including the amendments.
?Both President Maithripala Sirisena and the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) submitted amendments to the OMP Bill. If the amendments are not included, the OMP Bill would lead to grave repercussions. Therefore, the Government should make sure that the amendments are included in the Bill,? he told a news conference.
The JVP submitted several proposals to the Bill including a proposal which suggests that the OMP should inform the Inspector General of Police within 48 hours after it conducted a search. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

SL sailors not apprehended: Consulate
	
The eight Sri Lankan crew members of the ship Al Khalidia which was apprehended in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) are not under custody but were provided accommodation in Khorfakan pending salary dues and repatriation, Sri Lankan Consulate General in Dubai said.
Updating the Foreign Affairs Ministry on the situation, the Consulate General has said it was only the ship which had been apprehended and media reports of arresting Sri Lankan crew members were incorrect.
The ship, which is anchored in Khorfakan in the Fujairah Emirates in UAE, was apprehended some 20 months ago by the Fujairah Coast Guard following a complaint lodged by a third party.
?However, the ship had been apprehended and anchored by the time the Lankans had assumed duties on the ship. They have been provided accommodation in a house in Khorfakan and at the Khorfakan Port. The issues faced by the crew are salaries which have not been paid yet,? Consulate General has told the Ministry.
It said they were in touch with the shipping management company to ensure welfare of the crew and the company has informed that the salaries are yet to be paid because of the financial crisis faced by the company. However, it had agreed to settle the salary dues and repatriate the crew to Sri Lanka at the earliest.
On a previous occasion, another crew of 17 Sri Lankans had been recruited to the same shipping company last year and they had not been properly paid their due salaries.
Later the employees were safely returned with due arrears with the intervention of the Consulate General. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Speaker Karu Jayasuriya today declined to allow JVP MP Sunil Handunnetti from directing a Supplementary Question at Plantation Minister Navin Dissanayake on his assertion that he would quit his Ministerial post if the Finance Ministry proceeded with action to transfer the Tea Board funds to the Consolidated Fund.
At first, MP Handunnetti asked his main question regarding a coconut estate in the Piliyandala area. Then, he asked two supplementary questions on matters arising from the answer to the key question.
Next, he sought permission to raise yet another question about Mr. Dissanayake threatening to quit the Ministerial post.
"This is not relevant to the main question. But, can I ask this question with your permission? ," he asked.
The Speaker shot it down due to its irrelevance.
The Speaker is the father-in-law of Minister Dissanayake.
Therefore, in lighter vein, it was heard the MPs joking that the father-in-law came to the rescue of his son-in-law.
However, the Speaker brushed such jovial remarks saying personal relationships did not matter in doing Parliamentary business. (Kelum Bandara and Yohan Perera)

Sri Lankan student in UK jailed on fraud charges
	
A 27-year-old Sri Lankan student and a 50-year-old Indian shop worker have been jailed after they helped launder almost ?200,000 stolen from South West Communications in Exeter, UK, Express and Echo reported on Tuesday.
The student and the shop worker had allegedly allowed the fraudsters behind the Hustle style scheme to use their accounts to disguise where the money went.
They were just two of a number of people who worked together to defraud the Sowton based company out of ?784,551.15 in a scam in which internet bank accounts were hacked into and looted.
A conman posed as a member of the Lloyds Bank fraud investigation team and persuaded staff at the telecommunications firm to reveal crucial log-in details by telling they were investigating an attempt to hack into the accounts.
In reality, that was exactly what they did and as soon as they got the information they took the money in eight tranches of between ?90,000 and ?100,000.
The two suspects set up accounts into which the stolen money was sent electronically before being moved out again, probably to mysterious businesses in Singapore.
Both men claimed they had also been the victims of identity fraud and knew nothing about the bank accounts set up in their names but they were found guilty when a jury at Exeter Crown Court rejected their stories.
They were both jailed for 22 months by Judge Geoffrey Mercer, QC, who told them:"I don't know what the full truth of this case is. I certainly did not hear it from your evidence'.

The prosecution held that the suspects, former SDIG Anura Senanayake and former Narahenpita Crimes OIC Sumith Perera were charged under Sections 113 (Conspiracy) and 32 (Liability for act done by several persons in furtherance of common intention), of the Penal Code.
And according to the provision in Section 13 of the Bail Act, a person having committed an offence punishable with death or with life imprisonment, shall not be released on bail except by a Judge of the High Court, said prosecution.
They were arrested by the CID over the charges under Sections 113 (Conspiracy) and 32 (Liability for act done by several persons in furtherance of common intention), of the Penal Code in connection with the murder of ruggerite Wasim Thajudeen.
However, considering that the suspects had already filed revision bail applications in the High Court, the Magistrate re-remanded the suspects till September 7.
The former SDIG and the former Crimes OIC also have charges of causing disappearance of evidence, fabricating false evidence, touching it to screen the offender and conspiring under Clauses of 189,198 and 296 of the Penal Code. (Shehan Chamika Silva)
