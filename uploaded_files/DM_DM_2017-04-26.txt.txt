A love triangle and a man in a tangle
	

A former deputy purohita, he once created mayhem in the country.

The rebel-turned politico went out of the public eye after he failed to make it to Diyawanna at the last general poll. He came into limelight again when his wife living in the city made a complaint to Police that her husband had gone missing ever since he left her vowing that he was going to commit suicide.
According to informed sources, the politico was having a fling with a woman in Batticaloa area while running his home in Colombo. Despite the difficulty in shuttling between Colombo and Batticaloa, he had not been able to make up his mind to give up one of them in favour of the other.
Police who launched an investigation into the wifes complaint had traced our worthy to a house in Batticaloa where he was living incognito.
Now the good wife relieved that her husband was among the living was eagerly waiting for his return home, they say.

A quarrel over a tender affair
	

A senior Green party purohita from the Gampaha district and a fair PC member from the same district were recently involved in a tussle over a Katunayake airport tax service tender affair.

A bitter quarrel had ensued when the fair politico looking after the Katana electorate on behalf of the Green party had objected to the use of political clout by the senior purohita to make way for some his constituents to enter the airport taxi service.
The fair PC member also vowed to give up all positions she was holding in the party if the senior purohita was allowed to have his way, they say.

Bond scandal: Rs.10 bln loss for next thirty years: Fmr. DG
	
According to the personal computation of retired Deputy Governor, W.A. Wijeywardena, who testified at the Presidential Commission today, the governments long term loss for the next thirty years would be Rs.10 billion due to the failure of not meeting the appropriate terms in the process of issuing Treasury Bonds which took place on February 27, 2015.
His personal computation had also indicated that the immediate loss after the issuance of the bonds incurred Rs. 532 million to the government.
It was explained, that the February 2015 bond auction was originally intended to sell 1 billion rupees ($7 million) of 30 year bonds. Following the auction the Public Debt Department (PDD) had recommended to accept Rs. 2.6 billion amount of the bids.
However, disregarding the recommendation of PDD to accept only Rs. 2.6 billion, the Former Governor had unusually visited twice the PDD while the auction was taking place and had instructed to accept Rs. 10.058 billion amounts of bids at a higher interest rate of 12.5%.
When the recommendation was before for the approval of the Tender Board, the Governor had instructed the chairman of the board to accept the bid, even though there were some disputed arguments at the board discussions on the acceptance of bids.
Former DG said that instead of accepting such a high amount of bids at a very high interest rate, the Central Bank could have met the Rs. 13 billion fund requirement of the Government by March 2, 2015, using borrowings in a form of a hybrid version from both the Bank of Ceylon and in a way of REPO transactions with Employees Provident Fund. And still if there was a due balance, it could have then raised funds using the Direct Placements.
He was on the view that the Tender Board and Former Governor Arjun Mahendran had failed to exercise due diligence, since when such approval (10.058 billion amounts of bids) is before the Tender Board, the members and the chairman should have taken steps to prevent it, and also before instructing to approve such, Mr. Mahendran should have gone through the Monetary Board. I would say that ultimately the Monetary Board is responsible over the loss incurred to the government, he said.
When questioned over the interferences occurred to the PDD by the Former Governor, he said that his nine years as the chairman of the Tender Board had never seen such intervention of a governor while the bond auction was taking place nor any of other intervention into the process.
Explaining the consequences of the two decisions taken by the former governor that to remove the 5% penalty rate and the acceptance of 10.058 billion amounts of bids at a higher interest rate of 12.5%, he said those two decisions had caused the hike of the market interest rate later.

The Chairman of the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) Anura Wijayapala tendered his resignation to Power and Energy Minister Ranjith Siyambalapitiya this evening, the Ministry said.
The reason behind the resignation of former Chairman Wijayapala is said to be his reluctance to be flexible in implementing the decisions and policies of the Ministry when dealing with problems between CEB directors and the unions.
Mr. Wijayapala had wanted to tender his resignation in March last year but it was turned down at the time. However, the Minister had accepted his latest letter of resignation. (Chaturanga Pradeep)

CPC TU strike only put on hold, say TUs
	
The strike launched by the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) Trade Unions Collective was only called off temporary and would be launched again if the Government attempted to sell the CPC resources under-hand, CPC Trade Unions Collective said today.
Speaking to the Daily Mirror the CPC TU Collective Convener D. J. Rajakaruna said the strike was only temporary called off after the Prime Ministers written assurance stating the Government would not go for any agreement with India regarding the oil tanks without consulting the CPC TUs.
However, he said that the trade union action had made the Government kneel down and reverse their stance on selling the CPC resources.
He said due to the strike the Government witnessed the CPC unions power and though the TU action was stopped the TUs would stay alert observing Governments moves on the oil tank farm and other State resources.
He said that due to the circumstances they had learnt the value of alliance with other State and Non State trade unions and to expand their power to rise in a stronger manner in such situations.
HE said he had discussed with the Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) and other several organisations.
He said if the Government broke the word it would face more consequences.
He said the public backed them in their struggle and the union action made them to be aware on the coup to sell not only the CPC, but also the other resources as well. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

HDFC Bank signs MoU with Central Bank
	

Housing Development Finance Corporation (HDFC) Bank of Sri Lanka signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the Central Bank of Sri Lanka recently enabling HDFC Bank to contribute to the governments objective of generating one million jobs through establishing over 25,000 new businesses, with the utilization of resources in villages.
The Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) and National Policies and Economic Affairs Ministry have jointly designed the Swashakthi loan scheme for the micro, small and medium-scale enterprise (MSME) sector development and employment generation, on behalf of the Government of Sri Lanka (GOSL).
The main objective of the scheme is to generate employment opportunities, via providing financial support for new entrants and the existing entrepreneurs who are already engaged in income-generating activities in the agriculture and livestock, industrial and services sectors. Under this scheme, a special focus will be given to the youth, young graduates, women and differently
abled persons.
The new loan scheme covers the categories of agriculture, livestock, aquaculture, organic farming, post-harvest technology, industrial, information technology, automotive, construction, electronic and telecommunications, farm machinery, handicrafts, leather products, jewellery designing and manufacturing, welding, light engineering and fabrications sectors and other innovative
technology areas.
The bank expects to fulfil the financial needs of the youth, youth graduates, women and differently abled people at grass root level in order to meet the main objectives of the Swashakthi loan scheme.   
The bank will assess the viability and strength of the project plans when granting loans and under this loan scheme, the existing businesses will be given a maximum of Rs.250,000 at a nominal interest rate of 5.5 percent per annum.
Under this scheme, the new entrants, who are going to start new businesses, need to channel through the Small Enterprise Development Division of the National Policies and Economic Affairs Ministry and they will receive a maximum loan of Rs.200,000 together with Rs.10,000 initial grant and final grant of Rs.40,000 upon successful implementation of the project as per the business plan. 
HDFC has already proved its ability to achieve the objectives of earlier introduced credit lines by the CBSL. As a result of the effort made by the bank to promote the Commercial Scale Dairy Development Loan Scheme (CSDDLS), the bank was able to canvass new commercial-scale dairy farmers who were willing to expand their existing dairy projects and start new dairy projects.
HDFC is proud to state that out of the total CBSL loan portfolio (Rs.703 million), HDFC alone achieved a phenomenal disbursement of 41.25 percent (Rs.290 million) and that too within a very short period of time
(2013 onwards).
HDFC Bank is also proud to state that the bank has contributed 29 percent of the countrys annual housing requirement of 50,000 units in the year 2015. The bank has also disbursed a further sum of Rs.3.871 million to finance the extensions to the existing housing units and contribute 2.39 percent to the average decline in the number of individuals below the poverty line in 2015. (2015 CBSL Annual Report)
The banks unique doorstep banking service, which has widened the operational scope far beyond the physical limits of the branch network, will support the bank to directly access thousands of customers located in rural and semi-urban areas. Moreover, HDFCs past experience in working with rural and urban populations for more than 32 years will ease the effort of achieving the objectives,
stated above.

Is the US Really Blowing Up North Koreas Missiles
	

By Jeffrey Lewis 
(c) 2017, Foreign Policy  
The Trump administration has completed a policy review of how to manage the growing nuclear threat from North Korea. The new policy - massive pressure and engagement - is a tepid serving of leftovers from the Barack Obama, George W. Bush, and Bill Clinton administrations. I actually created a quiz of similar statements from all four administrations - and then when I looked at it a day later, I failed it. 
As so often happens when reality disappoints, people turn to rumour and fantasy. And so, disappointed with the reality that Donald Trump faces the same lousy options on North Korea that hamstrung all his predecessors, the new Washington bedtime story is that the United States is secretly hacking North Korean missile launches. 
The root of this particular bedtime story was a bit of reporting by The New York Times David Sanger and William Broad, asserting that the Obama administration had begun, about three years ago, to launch cyberattacks against North Korea analogous to those against Iran. 
While the United States is undoubtedly interested in penetrating Iranian and North Korean computer networks, and is doing a bit of mischief, thats a long way from the reality of some keyboard jockey in Utah taking command of a North Korean missile and piloting it into the drink. 
First, some inconvenient facts. North Koreas missiles arent really failing at a terrible rate. Sanger and Broad argued that soon after Obamas decision in 2014, a large number of the Norths military rockets began to explode, veer off course, disintegrate in midair and plunge into the sea. 
Correlation is not causation, of course, and a simple review of North Koreas missile launches suggests that if the United States is hacking North Korean missiles, it is doing a crap job of it. 
Since 2014, about three-quarters of Pyongyangs launches have succeeded. My colleague Shea Cotton keeps a database of every North Korean missile launch. Of the 66 missiles that North Korea launched during 2014 and after, 51 have succeeded. If hacking is playing any role, it is defeating a trivial number of missiles. A .230 average isnt enough to keep you in the major leagues. And its a lousy batting average against nuclear-armed missiles. 
Moreover, we can see those 15 failures were concentrated in a few new systems - missiles then under development where one would expect to see failures, hacking or no hacking. There was a spike in failures after 2016, but that spike was concentrated in four new systems that had never before been tested: the Musudan (five failures); a submarine-launched ballistic missile (three failures); an unidentified intercontinental ballistic missile (two failures); and a new anti-ship missile (two failures). Overall, North Koreas Scud and Nodong missiles - the ones that it plans to use to nuke U.S. forces in South Korea and Japan - worked just ducky. 
The fact is, new systems are expected to fail at a higher rate. There is, after all, a reason that rocket science is popular as a metaphor for tasks that are complicated and difficult. While the simple media narrative is to laugh at failed missile launches, the North Koreans learn from every flight, whether it works or not. 
Experiencing and overcoming failure is a normal part of building a robust and reliable rocket programme. Let me introduce you to Redstone, a missile literally nicknamed Old Reliable. It was Americas first large rocket, good enough to put Alan Shepard into space. Nine of the first 10 Redstone launches failed. Its possible, I suppose, that Wernher von Braun was an idiot. Or that Soviet spies had turned those lovely Hidden Figures ladies. Or maybe, just maybe, rocket science is fing hard. 
So while we laughed every time a North Korean missile exploded at launch (2006) or dropped into the drink (April 2009 and April 2012), Pyongyangs finest were busy studying what went wrong and fixing the problems. It seemed like North Korea would never figure it out . . . until it did. The last two North Korean space launches, in December 2012 and again in February 2016, were successful. Look up and you can still see North Koreas Kwangmyongsong-2 satellite in orbit. 
North Koreas missile launches arent failing because we are hacking them; they are failing because Pyongyang is developing a wide array of new liquid- and solid-fueled ballistic missiles. Many of those systems - especially the new solid-fueled missiles - are working just fine. And North Korean engineers will either figure the others out or learn from their mistakes and move on to more promising designs. 
Another troubling question is lurking in Sanger and Broads assessment: If the United States were successfully hacking North Koreas missiles, wouldnt it also be hacking Irans The two countries cooperate closely in missile development, so much so that it probably isnt possible to hack one without hacking the other. And, of course, it was Irans nuclear program that was subject to the original high-profile cyberattack - the Stuxnet virus that crippled Iranian centrifuges. 
Iranian missiles arent, however, falling out of the sky. And even Stuxnet was never more than an annoyance to the Iranians. Yes, it damaged a large number of centrifuges and slowed the Iranian enrichment programme for a few months. But, ultimately, Iran was installing thousands of centrifuges and developing new generations of the devices before the programme was constrained by the 2015 Iran
nuclear deal. 
I dont mean to say that the United States isnt attempting to get inside North Koreas networks. I suspect that the United States is probably very interested in attacking the systems that control North Koreas new generation of computer-controlled machine tools, which my colleagues and I believe have reduced Pyongyangs dependence on imported components for its nuclear and missile programmes. But there just isnt any reason to think cyberattacks are more than a nuisance.

The evidence suggests that the United States isnt succeeding in this regard and that, at best, such efforts would be a nuisance to the North Koreans. In fact, in the wake of Stuxnet, there were reports that a similar programme against North Korea had failed. Given the extensive missile cooperation between Tehran and Pyongyang, I would expect that they share cybersecurity tips. 
So why is the idea that the United States is hacking missiles out of the sky so prevalent It is hard to admit that political and coercive policies are not working. And its especially hard to admit that we are approaching a point where we are going to have to accept something we have long said is unacceptable. Denial, as Sen. Al Franken used to say, aint just a river in Egypt. 
This particular crisis has been a long time in the making. But for whatever reason, it is breaking into the popular consciousness now. People feel powerless, and they expect their government to do something. They just arent prepared to accept that this particular something is, well, nothing. So there must be some secret government agency, one that doesnt look like the post office, where people know what they are doing. 
Add to that a healthy dose of partisanship. We live in a bizarre era where every issue becomes a referendum on Donald Trump. While (slightly more than) half of us are convinced hes going to get us all killed, his fans desperately want to believe that hes not just some grifter in hopelessly over his head. And so when he says North Korea isnt going to test a missile in one of this Twitter outbursts, and then a missile test fails, the Drudge Report and his troll army on Twitter attribute the stroke of luck to Cheeto Jesus. Psychologists call this the fundamental attribution error. You see this a lot in cults. 
Its all a dangerous fantasy, though. The Trump administration plainly has no idea what it is doing, opting for a new strategy identical to the approach adopted by the Obama and Bush administrations. The unifying feature of this approach has been desperate paralysis - sorry, patiently hoping for a strategic miracle. 
Hacking allows us to entertain this fantasy a bit longer. It allows us to imagine that missile failures are not growing pains of an evolving and dangerous threat but evidence of our power, wisdom, and superior technology. The idea that hacking can prevent North Koreas missiles from working allows us to avoid coming to terms with the reality that our policies are failing.

Though the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) had removed former Minister and SLFP Senior Vice President Janaka Bandara Tennakoon from the Dambulla Electoral Organiser post, he was a forward player, who supported to bring President Maithripala Sirisena into office, SLFP Secretary Duminda Dissanayake said today.
He said the Mr. Tennakoon served President Sirisena well and played a major role to defeat then President Mahinda Rajapaksa and in creating the present Unity Government.
Addressing the SLFP press conference he said Mr. Tennakoons son Pramitha Bandara Tennakoon also resigned from the Central Provincial Council Minister of Industries portfolio, which he believed a loss to the party.
Pramitha resigned from his portfolio due to his father Janaka Bandaras removal from Dambulla Electoral Organiser. I dont find his action abnormal as it was his fathers dismissal that pushed him to take the decision, Mr. Dissanayake said.
He said a few organising positions were shuffled considering their commitment to the SLFP and the upcoming May Day organising process.(Thilanka Kanakarathna)

Macrons strong finish in  French election
	

By Griff Witte, Michael Birnbaum 
(c) 2017, The Washington Post  Apr 25, 2017  
BERLIN - In this era of fiery populism and muscular anti-globalist forces, politicians across Europe are suddenly discovering anelectoral surprise. 
It might actually pay to embrace the European Union. 
The top finisher in the first round of the French presidential election on Sunday is Emmanuel Macron, a 39-year-old centrist who jets to Berlin to give speeches in English. The blue-and-yellow banner of the EU flutters off his campaign headquarters. He is strongly favoured to beat his anti-Europe rival, Marine Le Pen, in a May 7 runoff. 
After years in which the EU was the favourite foil for ascendant politicians on the continent, the 28-nation club may be making a comeback despite Brexit and President Donald Trumps euroskepticism. The Netherlands staunchly pro-European Green Left party quadrupled its support in elections last month. The former European Parliament president Martin Schulz is surging in polls ahead of September elections
in Germany. 

And Macron has promised, if elected, to help lead an ambitious Europe, restoring France to a pre-eminent place in the EU after years in which the French role has been diminished by its domestic struggles with unemployment, terrorism and political dysfunction. He pledges to push for reforms that would force stronger nations to protect
weaker ones. 
Sundays balloting showed French attitudes toward Europe split down the middle, with euroskeptic politicians winning nearly half the vote. In addition to Le Pen, Jean-Luc Mlenchon, a far-left candidate, drew millions of votes. Opinion polls examining EU attitudes revealed conflicted feelings, with a majority of French respondents describing themselves as pro-EU but saying the institution needed deep reforms. 
Given such division, European leaders nervously watched the first-round voting to see which way France might tilt. On Monday, many political figures were unusually public about their support for Macron. 
German Chancellor Angela Merkels chief of staff, Peter Altmaier, tweeted that Macrons first-place finish showed that France AND Europe can win together. The centre is stronger than the
populists think! 
The centrist German lawmaker Alexander Lambsdorff heaped on more praise. Macron is a French John F. Kennedy, he told Germanys ZDF television on Monday. 
In a rare display of cross-continental comity, Macron also was congratulated by Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras, a combative leftist who has sparred with the German government ever since he was forced to accept a humiliating bailout in 2015. 
Pro-EU politicians were not the only ones to focus on Macrons attitudes toward Europe. 
Nigel Farage, the British anti-EU politician who helped lead last years Brexit campaign, tweeted dismissively that Macron gave his victory speech Sunday night with EU flag behind him. Says it all. 
Leaders in Europe normally maintain a studious silence when the vote isnt on their turf. That they didnt in this case reflects the gravity for Europe of the final round of the French vote. 
If Macron is elected - and opinion polls suggest he has a comfortable lead over Le Pen despite his first-round squeaker - continental leaders are cautiously optimistic that he can steer the beleaguered country back to its historically central role in European affairs. If Le Pen wins, modern Europe - defined by integration and growing cooperation across national boundaries - could fall apart after already being jolted by Britains decision to exit the EU 
Analysts believe that if Macron can put more of a Gallic stamp on the EU machinery in Brussels, he may have a chance to shift Frances complicated attitude toward the bloc back toward more positive ground, particularly if he can also jump-start his countrys stalled economy. 
The French liked Europe when it was a greater France, but they feel today that its no longer the case. Its a greater Germany, said Eddy Fougier, an expert on anti-globalization movements at the French Institute for International and Strategic Affairs.
For all their concerns about the EU, voters may be becoming more wary of disruptive European politicians as they watch Trump churn up political turmoil in the United States and Britain solidify its EU divorce plans. 
Dutch euroskeptic leader Geert Wilders crashed out of front-runner status ahead of March elections in the Netherlands. Germanys euroskeptic Alternative for Germany party spiked after Trumps election but has more recently split and sputtered. Now the ascendant political force in Germany is Schulz, a centre-left leader who spent more than two decades as a member of the European Parliament and has staked his career on a robust defence
of Brussels. 
And though Italys anti-establishment Five Star party is doing well before elections that must be called before spring 2018, few observers see them as the existential threat to Europe that a Le Pen presidency would be. 
The support for the centrist politicians reflects a reasonable approach to a reality that everybody must recognize, and that is the European Union, said Daniel Cohn-Bendit, a Franco-German former European lawmaker who supported Macron. 
Today more and more people are concerned about how we can protect Europe and the European project, Cohn-Bendit said. This has a link with Trumps election, with Brexit. 
At a time when the EUs popularity is on the wane, Macron has stood apart for his unabashed support for Europe and globalization. On a January trip to Berlins Humboldt University, he switched to flawless English to exhort students to build a stronger Europe. The move drew praise in Germany - and darts from his far-right rivals, who said he was disrespecting the French language. 
As the European powers-that-be closed ranks around Macron on Monday, they took two major risks. One is that by backing the French centrist, they will fan the flames of anti-establishment ire that have propelled Le Pens rise.

Marine Le Pen steps down as head of NF to woo moderate voters
	

French far-right presidential hopeful Marine Le Pen has announced that she is temporarily stepping down as her partys leader. 
The Front National leader revealed she would be quitting her role in her party to focus on the upcoming Presidential election. 
Mondays move appears to be a way for Le Pen to embrace a wide range of potential voters ahead of the May 7 runoff between herself and centrist Emmanuel Macron who came in first in Sundays first round.She announced on France 2: Tonight, I am no longer the president of the National Front. I am the presidential candidate. 
I will feel more free, and above partisan considerations. 
The news comes as she made it to the second round of the vote. 
In the first round of voting centrist Emmanuel Macron won 23.9 per cent and Le Pen received 21.4 per cent. 
Le Pen has said in the past that she is not a candidate of her party, and made that point when she rolled out her platform in February, saying the measures she was espousing were not her partys, but her own.Much of the antagonism towards the Front Nationale stems from its association with her father, the convicted racist Jean-Marie Le Pen, who is now 88. 
Mr Le Pen has officially been kicked out of the FN by his daughter, but he bizarrely remains honorary president of the party and an MEP.

He has also funded his daughters campaign by the equivalent of more than 5 million pounds.

Martyrdom and LTTE The worship of death
	
Historian, art historian and academic
Dr. SinhaRaja Tammita-Delgoda is indeed one of the few non-combatants allowed into the war zone during the final stages of the Eelam War. On his own initiative, he made an application to visit the operational areas and was granted permission to do so by the Defence Ministry. He toured these areas on three occasions between March and April 2009.  His work has been published in international media and military journals, and presented to audiences in the U.K., India and Canada. Dr. Tammita-Delgoda has never been an employee of the Sri Lankan Government nor the Defence Ministry. These impressions and supporting photographs are original and based on firsthand experience in 2009 when the war was still raging and had
entered its final stages. 
Outside the sprawling Army base at Vavuniya in Northern Sri Lanka stands a great Nuga (Banyan) tree. Its branches tower over the road, casting a spreading shadow over the line of vehicles parked beside. Underneath the tree is a small stone Kovil, a shrine to the Hindu deity, Lord Ganesha. Every vehicle heading North towards the war zone stops here and every soldier, Buddhist and Christian alike, gets down. Piling out of their trucks, lorries and jeeps, they make their offering to the Elephant God, seeking his blessing and protection. Sometimes, the Pusari (Hindu priest) himself comes out to bless them, daubing the flaming vermilion paste on
their foreheads. 
Religion is still a vital part of life in Sri Lanka and Buddhist temples, Hindu Kovils and Christian churches are found everywhere on the island. Despite the heavy fighting which has raged throughout the North, most of the Hindu shrines in the region remain intact. Although empty and abandoned, they lie untouched amidst the debris of war. Almost as numerous are temples of another kind. Modern, colourful, drawing on a blend of influences, they propagate a new religion. 
Outside the ruins of Pudukuduirippu Hospital is another shrine. Although the surrounding area is littered with bricks and shells, with its bright psychedelic colours, it is a cheerful sight. At its heart is a smiling young man with a halo around his head. He has large, round glasses, a moustache and a beatnik hairstyle. Although he looks more like a hippy poet, this smiling youngster was one of the very first martyrs to the LTTE cause. His name was Thileepan, a medical student from Jaffna. Suffering from blood cancer, he had gone to India for treatment. However, treatment had failed and Thileepan returned to his home town, weak and ailing. At the time, Jaffna was occupied by the Sri Lanka armed forces and to protest at their presence, Thileepan began a fast
unto death. 
At Pudukuduirippu, Thileepans likeness is surrounded by shades of heavenly blue. A parasol above his head confers special status on his portrait. Painted below is a lotus, the sacred flower of Buddhism and Hinduism. On the wall on either side are larger pictures of Thileepan, with a burning candle, several feet long. To one side a young woman in the garb of a temple maiden, kneels at his feet. Gazing at Thileepan in adoration, she offers flowers in her cupped hands. Shrines like this are found all over Tamil Eelam. Thileepan Day was declared a special day and every year on the anniversary of his death, lamps were lit and offerings made.  The air is alive with the rattle of machine guns and bursts of rifle fire. Now and again, there is a heavy thud and Thileepans smiles widen slightly as his image seems to dance from side to side. Over the last few months, the once-invincible Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) have been driven from stronghold after stronghold. Pudukuduirippu is the last town under their control and here the LTTE are putting up desperate resistance, standing and fighting to the death. Despite the daily losses, there is an endless stream of reinforcements. 

We are killing and wounding them everyday, yet there are still people coming forward to fight. Even now, they are willing to fight and die: General Kamal Gunaratne, Commander, Division 53, Pudukuduirippu. 
This relentless determination in the face of impossible odds has very deep roots. Its origins lie in the way in which the guerillas were able to mobilise the population in areas under their control. 
In every corner of the globe, the exercise books given to children are adorned with pictures, cartoon characters, animals and all kinds
of machinery.
In Sri Lanka, however, they have a particular fascination for children who love the bright, shiny pictures. Remaining with their owners from day-to-day, they are hoarded and treasured, carried everywhere and tended with loving care. 
The schoolbooks of Tamil Eelam are slightly different in character. One depicts a beaming young cadre in his Tiger stripes. This is Lt. Colonel Deva Rasiah Kannan from Vavuniya. Born on December 25, 1971, he died a hero on March 29, 2007.On the back cover is a parody of one of the most famous scenes in World War II -- The raising of the flag at Iwo Jima. Standing on a mound of helmets, a group of cadres raise the flag in jubilation. One shoots his T-56 off into the air, another brandishes a rocket launcher. Sprawled at their feet is the body of a Sri Lankan soldier. 
It is a special souvenir edition. Inside a series of entries lists the injuries which Rasiah sustained in the course of his duties. Beginning at Neriyakulam in Vavuniya in 1988, it goes down the page, chronicling the story of his wounds. All told, he was injured some 56 times.
The back cover carries two more portraits which appear above the Raising of the Flag.
One is of Rasiah and facing him is a girl in uniform, his cousin Rasiah Tamilchelvi, who also died in battle.
Both man and woman are given an equal place in the afterlife. Tamilchelvi, however, appears to have sprouted whiskers and been given bags under her eyes. Boys, even would be cadres it seems, will be boys. 
The Tiger creed dictated that every family must give at least one child to the struggle and every family who lost a child in battle were known as Mahaveeras, the great heroes of the Liberation struggle. Idolised in death, their flesh and blood were also looked after in life, treated with great honour and given special privileges. Government Agents in areas under the control of the LTTE were ordered to give them special consideration, channelling food, money and clothing to the surviving members. Exalting them in the eyes of their peers, the Tigers tied these families ever more closely to the cause, creating a group within the community which formed the backbone of their support. 
Once they lost Pudukuduirippu, the LTTE fell back to Pudumathalan on the seashore. At Pudumathalan, the most imposing permanent structure is a low squat building on the sands. Even in the glittering glare, it makes a splash of lurid colour. At first sight, it resembles a little church, reminiscent of the brightly-coloured buildings scattered up and down the islands coasts. Like a village chapel, a little iron gate leads into a space lined by flowerpots. The flower pots form a circle around a podium in gaudy red and yellow. Behind the podium is a pavilion in ocean blue.  Above the threshold is a Tiger, his face a snarling mask of white and orange. Framed against a ships wheel, he claps an anchor between his paws. The lines of the anchor behind him form a cross and there is the suggestion of a crucifix. It is not a church but a memorial hall, a monument to the Sea Tigers, the naval wing of the LTTE. Drawing on the people of the seashore, the Sea Tigers operated from bases dotted up and down the coast. Using small, very fast lightweight boats as suicide vessels, they posed a serious threat to the larger, heavier vessels of the Sri Lanka Navy. 
This hall was dedicated to Lieutenant-Colonel Charles Anthony, one of the first military leaders to lay down his life in the early days of the Tamil Tigers. In order to procure weapons for the movement, Charles led an attack on a police station in Jaffna. However, he was badly injured during the attack and his men wanted to carry him back to base. Deeming that the struggle was more important than his life, Charles ordered his cadres to shoot him so that they could complete their mission and return with the captured weapons. Moved by his sacrifice, Prabhakaran named his first son Charles Anthony. He also gave his name to the first attack unit formed by the LTTE. Known as the Charles Anthony Brigade, it was to become one of LTTEs elite regiments. 
This perhaps explains the two life size Kalashnikovs painted on either side of the doorway. Camouflage caps rest on their barrels and they are preceded by tall, burning candles. Inside there are no icons, no paintings and no candles, just a cavernous emptiness. A long low space, it was dark and empty, like the innermost sanctum of a Hindu shrine. In the Hindu temple however, the inner sanctum was the womb of fertility, the sacred, mysterious centre of all creation. Here it was the centre of extinction, a place of worship dedicated to the cult of death.

Like so many other coastal villages, Pudumathalan was a fishing settlement. Seagoing by nature, its inhabitants were all converts to Catholicism. Prabhakaran himself, many of his lieutenants and numbers of the rank and file were not in fact Hindus but Catholics. Taught from an early age by Catholic padres, they were firm believers of death, crucifixion, martyrdom and resurrection. Appropriating the forms and symbols of Catholicism and fusing them with the Hindu tradition, the Tamil Tigers created a new religion. 
Emerging once more into the brilliant glare, one is struck by the empty flowerpots, vivid in luminescent green. Each pot has several figures painted on the side. Largest of all is a woman with a rifle across her shoulder, her hair cropped short in the fashion of female cadres. On either side, holding her hand, are a boy and a girl. The woman is leading the
children to war. 
In South Asia, the sight of a farmer taking his children to work is common and all over Sri Lanka, both boys and girls help their parents in the fields. In Tamil society, women had traditionally been very subservient. It was the man who was seen as the breadwinner and head of the household. 
Reversing the position of the woman in Tamil culture, the LTTE liberated them from their customary role. Not only were they given an equal place in afterlife, they were respected, honoured and treated as equals in this life too. The woman was not only the wife and the mother, she was also the warrior. It was she, the mother, who led the way, mobilising not only her fellow women but also the
next generation.
The source of all fertility, she was the lifeblood of the Tamil revolution. As the mother of its cadres, it was she who would inspire the children to give their blood for the cause.

Monsters, Sorcerers and Storms Shakespeare in the Park brings The Tempest to life
	
To produce William Shakespeares final known play is no easy task. Add to that, the pressure of bringing it to life under incredibly-unpredictable weather conditions in open air is no less.
One could only imagine the tempest that was brewing in the minds of the production team that graced the Viharamahadevi Amphitheater stage on April 1 and 2. However, this years Shakespeare in the Park proved, yet again, that no storm could cloud the enduring spirit of a team of thespians who
aim to entertain.A cloudy Sunday night greeted the venue on April 2, where we found ourselves comfortably seated in the vast space provided by the Viharamahadevi Amphitheater, awaiting the opening of The Tempest by William Shakespeare, brought to life by AnandaDrama and presented by The Workshop Players. We prayed to the Weather Gods to hold off the rain for the next two hours (although we suspect the production team conducted their own anti-rain rituals prior to starting the show).
Prayers and rituals were answered; the minute lights came on the stage, the clouds above us disappeared, as if giving permission to the actors to replicate the storm they had been intending to make. Replicate, the actors did: not by loud thunderclaps and audio simulations of roaring seas, but by a simple yet effective method of body language on the part of the soon to be shipwrecked crew, tossing and swaying in line with the tempestuous ripples of the ocean.

Only when the stage was fully illuminated did we see the full set, which was beautifully and aptly made to complement a marshy island. The lighting scheme throughout the production was consistent, and complemented the mood and delicacy of the story perfectly. The nuances of purple and red used in the background did not go unnoticed, and certainly helped sustain the performances given on stage.
In terms of performance, it was not lost on the viewers that the entire production team had worked very hard to do justice to the Bards final play. Unlike many of his other plays, The Tempest takes place in real time, which means there are no lapses of days and weeks, only a matter of hours, in which time the actors are meant to portray character developments and progressions. This was successfully executed by many of the actors, including the actor who portrayed Prospero (Anuk de Silva), who arguably had the rather difficult task of sustaining the production, which he did successfully.
The character of Caliban was brought to life by a seasoned thespian (Nandun Dissanayake), portraying a far different and unique version to the inhuman, deformed creature that usually accompanies his description. Instead, this Caliban was portrayed with more focus on his characteristics as an insolent, rebellious, unwilling slave, rather than on his strange appearance. The acting was effortless, and the articulation of lines helped even the most clueless audience understand what he was saying.
Notable performances were also given by the actors who portrayed Adrian (Vihan Wickramasurendra) and Gonzalo (Amaz Irshad), who impressively sustained their characters throughout the production. The characters of Stephano (Vishan Gunawardena) and Trinculo (Andre Howson), the Kings silly and perpetually drunk servants, were also brought to life beautifully by the actors, who knew exactly how to capitalise on the humour, coupled with just the right use of slapstick, which tickled the audience every time they appeared on stage.
The title of Star of the Show, however, has to be given to the young actor portraying Ariel (Leeth Singhage), who left the viewers in awe with his perfect characterisation of the airy island spirit; light on his feet and magical in his movements. Add to that his singing capabilities, which left the audience with goosebumps every time he sang, and you get an actor who has a long and promising career
on stage in future.
The entire production was uplifted by its use of mystical music, song, and dance, which gave the audience the feeling of it taking place in a mysterious yet beautiful island, full of charming creatures. Special mention must go to the directors capitalisation of impactful moments, such as the scene in which Ariel is set free by his master Prospero, which was a tear-jerking moment indeed. It was also heartening to witness a range of young actors on stage, which we certainly hope encouraged young children to become more involved in theatre and in Shakespeare in particular.
Overall, the production of The Tempest that graced us on Sunday was a joyful celebration of song, dance, and theatre, and a real pleasure to have watched. Applause to the directors Nishantha de Silva and Ishtartha Wellaboda, AnandaDrama, The Workshop Players, Producer Jerome de Silva (who never disappoints), and the entire cast and crew for a wonderful evening in appreciation of William Shakespeares
final play.

My removal marks end of SLFPs journey: Janaka Bandara
	
Former minister and SLFP Senior Vice President Janaka Bandara Tennakoon said yesterday his removal as the Dambulla electoral organiser would mark the end of the journey of Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP).
He said it was a huge blunder committed by the SLFP to remove him from the organiser post saying that he was a committed and a dedicated SLFPer.
I am a son of SLFP convener T.B. Tennakoon. There are only two other such people in parliament today. They are D.A. Rajapaksas sons Mahinda and Chamal Rajapaksa. I am such a committed SLFPer. I love my party more than my life, he said.
He told Daily Mirror that his son also resigned from his ministerial portfolio of the Central Province and added that they were ready to face any challenge. Lets see who is going to win, he said.
The SLFP which came a long way through the history is similar to Meethotamulla garbage dump today. The end of its journey began today. he said. (Ajith Siriwardana)

Yahapalanaya has decided to enact new legislation aimed at widening the countrys fiscal base. Government has borrowed this new legislation from the African country Ghana, they say.

The interested parties have already laid the groundwork to place the new legislation on the countrys statute. However, some prominent figures in the legal sector as well as the TUs in the Inland Revenue department are reportedly up in arms against the move.
The proposed new legislation mainly intended to facilitate obtaining loans from the IMF and the World Bank is opposed by a section of the government itself, they say.

No risk of methane explosions in M'mulla dump: Champika
	
There is no risk of explosions caused by methane gas in the Meethotamulla garbage dump, Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka assured today.
Last week, the Japanese research experts warned of a methane gas explosion in the dump. However, the minister categorically denied reports saying there was not enough methane level to cause such explosions.
Addressing a news briefing held at the Ministry to make people aware of the measures which are being taken to rehabilitate the Meethotamulla garbage dump, he said a 12 point action plan is in place to rehabilitate it.
The action plan which includes 12 short term measures to stabilize the base of the dump will be completed within next five months. Three committees; expert, engineering and operations; are implementing the action plan. We must get ready for upcoming rains in May as it might make an impact on the dump, he said.
Meanwhile, the minister said it was reported during a meeting chaired by President Maithripala Sirisena on Wednesday that there are many other excessive garbage dumps across the country which would become a danger.
There are two massive garbage dumps in Kandy, one in Guhagoda and another in Gampola. They may not be of the same magnitude of Meethotamulla but they are also on the verge of becoming a threat especially polluting Mahaweli River and Polgolla Reservoir. It was also reported that there are garbage dumps in Galle, Matara, Kalutara and Gampaha which need attention, the minister said.
He said Local Government and Provincial Council Ministry will instruct local government bodies to minimize risks of garbage dumps and experts committees of the Megapolis Ministry will educate them how to take further measures.
Further clarifying on the subject, Moratuwa Universitys senior lecturer Dr. Mahesh Jayaweera said the combustible level for methane to cause explosions was 5% but the methane levels in the dump were less than 2%.
There is no risk of methane explosions but high risk of fire break-out remains due to the high levels of Carbon Monoxide (CO) levels at certain places in the dump. We are taking measures to address this issue, he said.
He said main objectives of the short term plans within the next five months are to control further collapses and stabilization of the dump site. Once the dump base was stabilized, the height of the dump would be reduced to 20 metres from present 48 metres to avoid further collapses, he said.
Research Scientist Manjula Gunawardane, who explained about the physical properties of the dump, said about 1 million cubic metres of garbage were in the Meethotamulla garbage dump.
Meanwhile, Field Engineer Major General Dhananjith Karunaratne said they received complaints about 33 missing persons in the tragedy and the army rescue and search teams were able to find 32 bodies and a part of a leg as of April 18. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Now he has to contend with comrades turning rebels
	

The party led by Prince Panchaudha is fast cracking up mainly because of his arbitrary actions as party leader, they say.

The Prince has come in for severe flak from the inner circle of the party for staging the recent fast-unto-death without consulting the party. He has also incurred their wrath for making it a habit to act against the decisions taken by the party hierarchy.
The talkative leader is also being blamed for the unwise decision to function in the council as an independent group within the opposition. This decision has given rise to a legal challenge to the status of the partys council members.
Meanwhile, the partys long standing stalwart from Rajarata holding a seat in the Diyawanna council is said to have met Number One at his palace which has given a hint about the trouble brewing within the party, they say. 
Comrades Muza and Wije who once represented the party in the council too have fallen out with Prince Panchaudha.
Meanwhile, some have already begun fishing in troubled waters, they say.

A heated exchange between a prominent purohita in yahapalanaya and a provincial ruler that took place at a main Buddhist temple in Senkadagala area made sensational news in the hill-country recently.

An argument the ruling one got involved in with the purohita when the latter called at this temple had led to the heated exchange, they say.
The provincial ruler who is said to have mastered the art of manipulating even the planetary influences to suit her purpose is known to be a frequent welcome visitor to the palace in the city.
She had even told the Green national list purohita, a leading businessman to boot that she felt like giving him the punch-bag plus football treatment. However, the purohita who ignored the challenge had left the scene post-haste in his vehicle, they say.

A total of 2,000 buses had been reserved to transport Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) supporters to the partys May Day rally scheduled to be held at Getambe, in Kandy, the SLFP announced today.

He said more than 20 constituencies of the United Peoples Freedom Alliance (UPFA) were scheduled to attend the rally apart from thousands of Tamil and Muslim supporters from the North and East.
He said the SLFP rally would be held in an exemplary manner to other parties, especially without harming the Kandyan pride, environment and religious places.
He also said the SLFP rally would be more colourful with the participation of SLFP Youth Front, Trade Unions and party supporters.
This year the rally will break last years record, he said.
He said electorate organisers had requested more buses to provide transports for SLFP supporters.
We believe that hundreds of thousands of SLFP supporters will join with us at Getambe, he said. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

PM's assurance on oil tanks is misleading: JO
	
The Joint Opposition today said that the written assurance given by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe to the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) was misleading and the government would go ahead with the proposed agreement to be signed with India regarding the Trincomalee oil tanks.
JO member MP Udaya Gammanpila told a news briefing that the written assurance given by the Prime Ministers Secretary had not assured that no agreement would be signed regarding the China Bay Oil Tank Farm in Trincomalee during his Indian tour.
In the written assurance, it has only mentioned that they would hold discussions with the CPC prior to the signing of any agreement regarding the Trincomalee oil tanks. So it has already proven that the government will sell these oil tanks to India, he said.
Meanwhile, JO member Pro. Tissa Vitharana said 74 of the Trincomalee oil tanks were already decided to offer to India by the government on a long term lease even though they have continuously said that they would not sell these to India.
JO member MP Dullus Alahapperuma said the country was more important to them than anything else and added that they would stand against any injustice faced by the country.
The selling of Hambantota Port to China was also temporarily halted to a certain extent with the intervention of the people and the joint opposition, he said. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)

Cabinet Spokesman Minister Rajitha Senaratne said today the President Maithripala Sirisena requested Minister Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka to quit the ministerial portfolio and take up the post of army commander or overall commander for two years to discipline the country.
He told the weekly Cabinet briefing that Field Marshal Fonseka was known as a well-disciplined character in the country and that he would expedite investigations over several issues as well.
Minister Senaratne said the Field Marshal had agreed to quit his ministerial portfolio and take up the post if he was given proper powers and responsibility.
The question and answer session between the media and Minister Senaratne is as follows:
Q. What was offered to him, the post of Army commander or Overall commander
A. Either of them.
Q. What was his reaction to the request
A. He told that he was prepared to accept the post if proper responsibility and powers were given to him.
Q. Did he say that he was prepared to quit the Ministerial portfolio and take up the new post
A. Yes, that is how decisions are taken on behalf of the country.
Q. What is expected from the Field Marshal
A. He will do it well. Security forces asked us what was this joke happening in the country. They questioned if investors and tourists would come here if this situation went on. They said Give us more powers. We will take care of Colombo.
Q. Is it reasonable to give powers to a single person, may be a minister or an official to do this
A. He will report his decisions to the Cabinet and the Cabinet will implement them.
Q. Is the government trying to create a character like Gotabaya Rajapaksa
A. No, no, Fonseka is not a brother of the President. He cannot act as Gota did. Mahinda Rajapaksa was afraid of Gota.
Q. Do you accept that the civil administration had collapsed under this government
A. Yes, people say so. They ask us to take action immediately when we went to our villages.
Q. This government was brought to power to ensure the right to protest.
A. Trade Unions have right to do so. The question is staging protests for political agendas.

SF-led committee to deal with emergencies
	
President Maithripala Sirisena is reported to have proposed a special subcommittee headed by Minister Sarath Fonseka to make recommendations on how best to deal with emergency situations triggered by incidents such as disruption of the power supply, port activities and fuel distribution.
The idea was mooted against the backdrop of the disruption caused to fuel distribution by petroleum workers launching trade union against the move to lease the Trincomalee Oil Tank Farm to an Indian Oil Company.
The strike was called off on Monday night after an assurance given by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe who left for India yesterday for talks with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
The Cabinet discussed this matter last morning with the President reportedly asking Field Marshal Fonseka to head a committee comprising all stakeholders including the military and the Law and Order Ministry to respond to emergency situations.
The President made this proposal in response to views expressed by some ministers that the military should be trained to deal with such situations. They said some 1,500 petroleum workers were able to cripple the activities of the Government and that should not be allowed in the future. (Kelum Bandara)

Stage being set for new-look yahapalanaya
	

A prominent purohita who is said to have played a vital role behind the scenes to bring the yahapalanaya into power had a three-hour one-on-one discussion with Number One quite recently.

This talkative purohita who is, by the way, an official mouthpiece of the government had urged Number One to make certain long overdue changes as part of an overall plan to set the regime on a sound footing.
The purohita had during the lengthy discussion also mentioned several names as those they should lose no time in winning over to the government.
Soon after this discussion, Number One had sent word to a gung ho monk residing in Narahenpita saying that he wished to meet him for a friendly chat.
A loyal supporter of the former strongman, the monk after readily accepting the invitation had had a powwow with Number One. The outcome of this meeting remains a secret, but observers say that it is quite obvious that the stage is being set for a politically significant event in the near future.

The devastating aftermath of the Meethotamulla tragedy Victims speak out in pursuit  of justice
	
Eleven days have passed since a massive heap of garbage of the Meethotamulla garbage dump collapsed killing 32 people and destroying stretches of houses in its wake. Currently out of the 98 families listed to receive houses, 30 have been offered flats. The rest of the displaced have been requested to leave the premises of the Terrence Maha Vidyalaya, so that activities in the school can recommence unhindered. However, the displaced claim that no viable option has been offered to them.
On April 14, all within thirty seconds, a stretch of houses was lifted up due to the force exerted by the collapse. This stretch collapsed on another stretch of houses previously unaffected by the dump, destroying them. Over and over again inhabitants in the vicinity of the Meethotamulla garbage dump have voiced concern about an impending disaster. Though they did not foresee a tragedy with such a magnitude that would devour 32 lives, they knew things were not turning out well. Protesters were brutally dispersed. Some affected by last years floods are yet to be compensated. 
Most people have opposed proposals to move to the paddy storage complex temporarily, as the school had to be emptied. Thusitha Sudathkumara, the Kolonnawa Divisional Secretary, told Daily Mirror yesterday that they planned to clear the school to reopen today. However school authoritative sources told yesterday that though the number of displaced people housed had lowered, there did not seem to be an environment conducive to reopen the school. 
In an announcement issued by Sunil Kannangara, the Colombo District Secretary, it is stated that those whose houses are completely destroyed, damaged or those asked to evacuate, could obtain a house worth Rs 4,000,000 from the housing scheme of the Urban Development Authority. Those unwilling to accept these houses will be given Rs. 50,000 for three months or until compensation is provided. 
In addition, those whose houses have been completely destroyed would be given an allowance of Rs. 250,000 to purchase furniture and other goods. Those who have been asked to evacuate in the danger zone would be given Rs. 10,000 to transport their goods and belongings. However the affected people temporarily residing at the Terrence N. De Silva School, raised practical concerns regarding the options available. For instance, residents point out that no landlord would rent out a house for a month or three, when the norm is to pay a key money worth the rent for the whole year. 
The Convener of the Movement against the Meethotamulla garbage dump Keerthi Ratna Perera said that officials were planning on assessing the damage and providing compensation within a month. In the meantime residents have to find a house for rent on their own. But you cant get a house in this manner as you need to pay the rent for a year in advance. Then people thought that they should get the Rs. 250,000 provided to purchase goods, and the rent allowance to get a house, he said. 
We dont believe anything politicians say until we are given whatever they have promised, he added.Ninety eight families have been promised houses. Thirty accepted them, and the rest were not willing to.They will be given Rs. 50,000 (rent) and Rs. 250,000 (to purchase goods etc). Some cheques were handed over on Monday, he said. 
According to Nuwan Bopage, lawyer and organizer of the Movement against the Meethotamulla garbage dump, 135 families are displaced, and seven people thought to be buried in the rubble are missing. 
The history of the unrelenting struggle
Until 2009 garbage was dumped at Bloemendhal. However a case was filed by the people of Bloemendhal against the dumping of garbage. Then the Chief Justice at the time, ordered that the garbage be dumped temporarily in a 2-acre plot of land in pothuwilkumbura. In addition, if someone protested it was ordered that they can be arrested. At that time 800 tonnes of garbage was dumped daily. By the time tragedy struck 1200 tonnes was dumped daily, said Bopage. Reminiscing his childhood, he said that the garbage dump had been a bare extent of land with lush trees where children used to fly kites. 
A series of events compelled the residents to organize themselves as a movement and seek justice. In 2011 the area of the garbage dump extended to cover 19 acres. By then the garbage dump was 200 feet high. The Meethotamulla Sri Rahula Vidyalaya was closed in October 2011. At the same time walls and floors of 100 houses in the vicinity of the garbage dump cracked. People wanted to seek judicial redress, but then agreed for a compensation, said Bopage. 
Thereafter we organized ourselves as a movement and in 2012 we held our first protest. The government promised to give us a solution within three months. But there was no such solution after three months. In April we blocked garbage trucks entering for two days by constructing a temporary hut, he recalled. 
In the meantime the police filed a case against me and a few others at the Colombo Magistrate Courts. While we were at courts a battalion dispersed the protesters brutally. Women were assaulted. Then we protested, petitioned, put up posters everywhere, but to no avail, he added. 
In March 2014 after a protest we were invited to a discussion with Gotabhaya Rajapaksa who promised to solve the problem within six months, and we were contented. But the issue wasnt solved within six months and we protested once again, he sighed. 

In February 2015 the police sprayed water when we protested. Then we were invited to a discussion with Prime Minister Ranil Wickremasinghe who appointed a committee with the UDA chairman as the head, he said. The committee had promised to intervene and find a solution within six months. They had advertised calling for project proposals. There were around 60 projects and some were very viable. When these projects were not approved we realized that there was a mafia going on, Bopage stressed. 
According to Bopage there have been alleged discrepancies amounting to almost a whopping Rs. 200 million in the estimated value of a tender of solid waste management services, and the value at which it was given. The Chairman, Deputy Chairman and the opposition member of the Kolonnawa Municipal Council have 14 trucks which are sent outstation to collect garbage from companies, to be dumped here. Then they get all the money, he charged implying that the garbage dump has been a pot of gold for those in power.  In December 2015 the movement protested once again, and Bopage said that protesters were beaten. No one listened to us and now people have died, he lamented. 
Bopage pointed out that the environment created, surrounding the garbage dump, was not very pleasant and was conducive to alcoholism and drug abuse. He said that 101watte, 23watte and Nagahamulla were drug hubs and he alleged politicians were responsible for this sad plight.

They think it is a religious practice
	

A departmental head who is keen on making meditation part of the days schedule for all his employees has for a start ordered all staffers in his office to participate in a 15-minute meditation session every working day of the week.

By the way, a minor employee who could not attend the meditation session was pulled up recently.
This departmental head has made it compulsory for even non- Buddhists for whom meditation is something foreign to participate in the meditation session which has become a daily feature. Some of these staffers have decided to file a HR case for being required to observe a religious practice which is alien to the religions they profess. Some high-ups in the department are said to be extending their moral support on the sly to the staffers set to challenge in courts the practice foisted on them, they say.
