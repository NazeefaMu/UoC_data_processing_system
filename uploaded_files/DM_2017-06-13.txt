A manifesto against conventional theatre
	

The Garage Show About Living On Garbage will be staged on the 16th, 17th and 18th of June at No. 12, Grenier Road, off Cotta Road, Colombo 8.
At its most basic level, the theatre is rooted in what can be expressed and projected. The notion that it belongs to a packed, air-conditioned hall with audiences kept comfortably seated, therefore, cant really be vital. Far from allowing scope and liberating productions, these venues seem to have constrained them formally, forcing the same plotline to be worked out again and again. Personally, therefore, I see nothing wrong in getting away from the proscenium. For that matter, there is nothing to be lost by it either. The truth is that the theatre is more, much more, than the hall.
Last year a group of actors, writers and directors got together over an idea. That idea congealed into a concept. IdeaCouch. The concept, in a very pithy sense, was derived from the belief that stage productions needed to be liberated from the stage. But IdeaCouch was a performance company. It had a wide range of ideas, some of which were workable while others were not. One of those ideas which did work, and which continue to date, is the subject of my article. The Garage Show. The company has so far given us three Garage Shows. A fourth is yet to come.
But what exactly is The Garage Show Does it operate in some underground garage Not really. Put very simply, it is a series of plays that arent really plays. They are skits. Skits which work out into a collage. And a collage that forms up a theme. The first such Show was about Labour Day. The second was about getting married. The third was about celebrating the season (staged in December). What separates all three from the fourth, to be unveiled this Friday, Saturday and Sunday at No. 12, Grenier Road, Colombo 8, is that they were all seasonal. The Garage Show About Living on Garbage, by contrast, is based on an issue, one which has escaped our playwrights.
To talk about what The Garage Show is means dwelling on what it is not. It is not constrained. It is not epic. It is not inhibited or empowered by the amenities of a hall. It is for the most devised, which means that, despite the fact that there is a script, and more than one script, its rooted in ideas as opposed to preconceived plotlines. It doesnt just encourage one to imagine and fill in the blanks, moreover: it forces one to be part of the performance, since all its shows have been staged in houses where spectators get to see a skit from different angles. There is no single, exact slant to a Garage Show, in other words. One sees, one infers, and one leaves.
Susan Sontag once observed that the best modern plays were devoted to raking up private, rather than public, hells. This is true of Strindberg, Shaw, Pirandello, Miller and Ionesco. This is also true of devised theatre. The Garage Show is no different. In skit after skit, performance after performance, I have been lifted, empowered, chastened, disillusioned, humbled, and even annoyed by those private hells which their producers rake up for us. But they arent private through and through. They dont devote all their energy to their own workings. They obtrude on the audience, so as to make them understand the wider relevance of what theyre trying to get at. They subsume the public in the personal, in other words. And they succeed.
The process which those producers follow, therefore, is time-consuming, meticulous, painstaking. They first decide on a theme. Then they move on to a phrase to get away from the inhibitions of limiting that theme to a word. That is how we get The Garage Show About Celebrating This Season as opposed to About Christmas, and The Garage Show About Getting Married as opposed to About Weddings. The cast, usually numbering up to 10 or 12, are invited, never pre-selected: you see fresh faces cropping up in every show. What follows is a brainstorming session that can last for days, even weeks. Ideas come up, are accepted, rejected, or reworked, and a set of skits are fleshed out to ensure that they congeal into their theme and phrase.
In the end, they become deceptively self-worked, deceptively straightforward. Because they thrive on scripts and scriptwriters, they arent the former. Because the themes they engender are much more than what is implied in their titles, they arent the latter. For that reason, you wont see the kind of slipshod vrit you come across in the movies, plays, and paintings of avant-garde artistes. Unlike the cinema of Cassavetes and Warhol and the theatre of Allan Kaprow, these are tempered by a sense of discipline which is formally liberating. Consequently, you get the best of both worlds: an unconstrained, devised work of art which isnt cut off from the audience.
Which brings me to what liberates them in the first place. The English theatre, more so than the Sinhala theatre, is professional insofar as the dedication of its coterie and players, producers, and writers is concerned. Beyond that, it is limited by certain factors, including the cost of the venue. These are necessary evils, and to get a production to an audience one must endure them, but more often than not, they prevent the playwright from, for instance, paying his or her cast and crew. The Garage Show, and IdeaCouch in general, doesnt operate like that. It pays those who are involved in it and ensures that those aforementioned factors are dispensed with.
How so, exactly By settling in for a house instead of a hall, of course. That is why the people behind The Garage Show are particular about where they stage it. That is also why attention to detail is a must and why they explore everything, anything, which gives them ideas to work on. This is superficially inhibiting, but in fact liberating: because their ideas are predicated on a minimal budget, they must think. And ideate. I am no thespian, only a copywriter from an advertising agency. But I know the process of briefs and delivery, of aligning creativity with whats demanded by outside parties. I know how imaginative that process is, and how it forces one to not be complacent with the luxuries a hall or a large budget typically yields.
And to a considerable extent, that is the philosophy behind IdeaCouch as well. While The Garage Show is its primary showcase item, it has indulged in other more conventional skits at various functions, including the United Nations Environment Day and the anniversary of the Family Planning Association (Engendering Yahapalanaya). To be sure, one year cant yield a prodigious output, but IdeaCouch has ensured that its skits have been fine-tuned to the audience specific to the function that has featured it. There is a commercialised backdrop to this aspect of the companys work, which I think is refreshing: the days when our English theatre was an insular experience seem to have gone by. IdeaCouch is doing to that theatre, in other words, what Marcel Marceau did to mime.
There is a time to write and a time to watch. The time to watch has come, I believe. Without turning something that is simple into something that is impossibly profound, I will hence conclude on this note. The recent spate of productions that have consciously opted away from the hall is not only recent, but also inevitable. I unfortunately missed some of these productions, but IdeaCouch, with its sketches of themes, issues, and phrases, have restored my faith in the theatre in that regard. For that reason alone, you should watch their latest production, About Living on Garbage.

15 Applications to establish Private Medical Institutions
	
Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) revealed yesterday that fifteen applications have been received by the Health Ministry and the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) to establish private medical institutions in the country.
In a press briefing held at Colombo the GMOA's Assistant Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said in 1980 there were around 100 State owned medical institutions in India with no private institutions however 30 years later its has exceeded 200 private medical institutions while government owned only 183.
Dr. Aluthge said that the demand for Indian graduate doctors are decreasing in the global perspective due to various shortcomings following the increase of private medical institutions in the country. He added that same situation will prevail in Sri Lanka if the government allows more private institutions to operate in the country.
Indian politicians offer licenses to open up private medical colleges to their supporters as bribes and fortunately our politicians bribe their supporters by permitting them to establish bar or fuel stations. However in future SL politicians would too follow the footsteps of Indian politicians and drop the countrys medical education in a chaos, he said.
He said that according to the international media, one sixth out of 400 medical institutions have been corrupted as most of them were established through political affiliations.
Dr. Aluthge warned that our country will become worse than India if the government allows to establish private medical institutions. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

Bribery Com. files case against Keheliya
	
The Bribery Commission (BC) has filed a case against former media minister Keheliya Rambukwella and former State Printing Corporation chairman Jayampathi Bandara Hinkenda for causing a loss to the government by obtaining Rs.230,984 to pay the former ministers phone bill.
The BC said the government provided a monthly allowance of Rs.40,000 to ministers to pay their monthly phone bill but the former ministers bill had inflated his bill.
It said Mr. Rambukwella had obtained funds by using SPC vouchers in a fraudulent manner to settle his phone bill and had conspired with Mr. Hinkenda to so.
In addition 13 other bribery cases have been filed against Mr. Hinkenda for causing a loss of Rs.75 million to the government. The case was fixed for July 17. (By Yoshitha Perera)

CDB March quarter net up 22% over lower provisions
	

Citizens Development Business Finance PLC, a licensed finance company commonly known as CDB, for the March quarter (4Q17) reported earnings of Rs.394.4 million or Rs.7.26 a share, which translated to an increase of 22 percent year-on-year (YoY), the interim financial accounts showed.
But the companys core-financing business and fee incomes were seen adversely impacted by the rising interest rates and also perhaps by the slowdown in leasing and other loans.
CDB group, which comprises of 90.38 percent-owned specialised leasing firm, Unisons Capital Leasing Limited, reported a 6 percent YoY decline in its net interest income to Rs.779.7 million, while the net fee and commission incomes also fell by 4 percent YoY to Rs.841.3 million.
The performance was however assisted by higher other operating incomes, a sharp decline in provisions made for possible bad loans, a decline in expenses and lower financial value-added tax and nation building tax payments, YoY.
Meanwhile, for the financial year ended March 31, 2017, the CDB group with an asset base of Rs.54.2 billion, reported earning Rs.1.02 billion or Rs.18.83 a share, virtually unchanged from the previous year.
The loans and advances to customers grew by 4.8 billion during the full financial year while the customer deposits grew by Rs.1.8 billion, with the balance being funded through borrowings, which included a debenture.
Growth in lending was supported by growth in the share of non-auto lending, which represented 7 percent of total lending compared to 5 percent last year.
During the period under review, the gross NPL ratio further improved to 3.08 percent, compared to last years 3.62 percent, the company said in a statement.
The provisions made against the possible bad loans came down by as much as 43 percent YoY to Rs.232.2 million. 
The other operating incomes, which mostly comprise of trading gains of the groups financial investments, rose by 24 percent YoY to Rs.784.6 million.
Meanwhile, both the Tier I and II capital adequacy ratios stood at 12.32 percent and 14.12 percent, respectively, compared to the regulatory minimum of 5 percent and 10 percent, the statement by the company stated. 
By March 31, 2017, Ceylinco Life Insurance Limited held a 33.54 percent stake being the largest shareholder of the company.

## Title: Condominiums :  The next  big  worry

Condominiums :  The next  big  worry
	
High rise buildings have started to dominate the entire Colombo cityscape. Every block of land around the corner is identified as a potential site for condominiums and other high-rise buildings. Concepts of vertical living have been brought forward. Just a few days back, a building collapsed in Wellawatte, burying many lives under concrete. 
The archaic condominium law would bring in more damage than expected. Therefore, it is high time the government appointed a competent, professionally-qualified planning team to manage the archaic condominium law, as most condominiums are constructed without approved plans and deeds. This could lead to a major fire or other calamity due to construction defects. 
With Colombos skyline rapidly changing with high-rise buildings, are we paying adequate attention to the law that governs condominiums and their fire safety measures in case of fire 
Speaking to the Daily Mirror, Kirthimala Gunasekera and Ajithaa Edirimanne, Attorneys-at-Law and two experienced lawyers in land matters explained the urgency to look into reforms necessary for the Condominium Law. 
Many condos are constructed without approved plans and title deeds: Kirthimala
A person buying a condominium will only look at the brochure, says Kirthimala Gunasekara. He will not ask whether the law has been followed, plans have been approved, whether deeds can be obtained, insurances taken or whether there are fire safety measures and whether the Fire Brigade could get up to the 30th floor if a fire breaks out. Even if you do a self-assessment before buying a condominium, you will find that the answers are vague and negative. In addition to that, the plans of the condominium-building may not be approved by the relevant authorities and many condominiums exist on a No document basis. Therefore the documents necessary to construct and own condominiums according to the law are not approved. 
Speaking further, Mrs. Gunasekara said many condominium properties in several areas, especially Wellawatte did not observe any of the aforesaid approval requirements. Hundreds of condos are constructed without approved plans and title deeds. In most instances, developers have collected funds and cannot be contacted to approve the plans and issue deeds to owners. 
Ajitha expresses that as a consequence, there are many sub-standard buildings mushrooming in urban areas and the likelihood of a major disaster is a certainty. 
No doubt there are several condominiums managed by reputed companies according to the law but the situation is not satisfactory, as all condominium buildings need to be protected against fire and sub-standard constructions. Contractors and developers are not responsible after they complete the construction and foreign contractors may not be in the country toanswer questions. 

Documents necessary to construct and own condominiums
Approved plans are duly registered in the land registry to be attended to by the developer. 

Approvals are necessary from the multitude of organisations, local authorities, urban councils or Pradeshiya Sabhas. Further, approvals from the Urban Development Authority (UDA) are necassary and in addition, special approvals may be required from the Central Environment Authority (CEA); Electricity Board (CEB); National Water Supply and Drainage Board (NWS and DB): and Condominium Management Authority (CMA) 

Approved notarised deeds should be attended by the notaries for the owners. 

The obtaining of approvals is not an easy task as the existing law does not make it easy for developers to construct major multi-storey projects. This is because getting all approvals in time from the organisations would be quite time-consuming since these processes are spread out into various Government organisations and extra-legal methods have sprung into place. 
Therefore condominium buildings are constructed without approved plans and the execution of deeds and are hence known as No Document Condos. 
The condominium industry is no longer in its infancy. The principle enactment came into being in 1973 with two important amendments in 1982 and 2003. There are many areas that the law has not been addressed to meet the current demand, there are no regulations issued to date to implement the provisions of the existing law which have not only caused confusion to unit owners but also made the task of theregulator difficult. 
Revising the law, introducing regulations and making the regulator effective with training for its staff, are all crucial to making condominiums safe. Sri Lanka needs to pay more attention to the risk of fire and the need to have an emergency action plan for such unexpected situations. 
However in such a No Document environment, Sri Lanka seems to be blissfully happy with the boom going to the edge of a cliff awaiting a fall.
 
Who is responsible
According to Kirthimala and Ajitha, the law enforcement authorities and developers share a common set of responsibilities to condominium owners and the society (the entire neighbourhood in which a condominium is situated) if a fire breaks out. It is therefore absolutely essential that condominiums are built with all approvals and if the law is cumbersome and insufficient, immediate action should be taken by those responsible to remedy the situation. 
The law has made it more complicated to approve plans. Therefore, when a single approval and registration is sufficient, a Condominium plan has to be approved and registered twice according to the present law. 
Sri Lanka has a unique registration system for plans; here the plans have to be registered twice and this requirement definitely has to be amended since it is not only a cumbersome procedure but also costly for the developer.

Quick fix solutionto ignore the law and build without approvals
The duo further said that a majority of developers refrain from following the required approval and registration procedures. Pre-sales of units thus take place without registered approved plans with the help of attractive brochures. 
Even the banks disregard the law and register Tripartite Agreements on the main land in the books of the registry as the plans are not approved and registered. They do not register mortgage bonds for the respective condominium units. 
Such extra-legal methods to defeat the Condominium law are available as the old law relating to registration introduced by the British (Registration of Documents Ordinance of 1927) is still in force. 
Some resort to non-notarial deeds which are a sort of written document, or retain the agreements to sell that are often not notarised and merely go into occupation. These documents do not confirm ownership. 
One of the very important provisions of the condominium law is the appointment of management committees in order to continue to manage the units. Today, some condominiums have no such management committees appointed to manage garbage, maintenance of buildings, electricity and water and there is no proper organisation to strictly enforce the law. 
Experiences
Some reported experiences of those living in condos without the law enforcement authorities taking any action 

The common area including the main entrance has been leased out to third parties by the Developer without the consent or knowledge of the unit owners. The Common areas are jointly owned by all unit owners and therefore their consent is absolutely necessary to lease or alienate their joint ownership rights. 
	
	The doors are shifted by neighbouring owners to the corridors enclosing space 
	
	The water tanks are unclean and leaking 
	
	Construction defects have become a nightmare for some prospective buyers of condominiums 
	
	Unscrupulous developers find ways and means to hide defects till the units are sold. It is rare for a buyer to detect construction defects unless he or she has a background in civil engineering or a specialized knowledge of building works 
	
	Parking of vehicles blocking entrances and fire hydrants is a common feature 
	
	Floor tiles come off and cracks appear on the walls 
	
	Electrical connections are temporally repaired by individuals without any supervision 
	
	The Council does not have the funds to attend to repairs and blames the developer for the defects 
	
	Since title deeds have been issued to all its unit owners, the developer is not unduly concerned. Though the Council understands the law and wants it to be rectified, the developer controls or influences the Council preventing the rectification of this situation 
Various criteria need to be fulfilled before owners reside: Devsriyani Jayasundera
On a follow-up, the Daily Mirror spoke to Devsriyani Jayasundera, Vice President of the Institute of Town Planners to find out in which ways condo-developers should be responsible when constructing condominiums. When looking at it in the economic perspective, having condominiums is good. People are moving towards vertical living but when developing new condominiums, there are various environmental issues as well. Wetlands and other places would get disturbed and therefore the biodiversity would be greatly affected. But there are several aspects to consider when constructing a condominium. 
Mrs. Jayasundera further said the condominium law had been in existence for a long time. Earlier, the developer could approve the building, build it and give approval. There are different ways residents could claim ownership of apartments. In the provisional method, the building plan with the condominium could be approved, the houses are sold and then the apartment is built. Thereafter the apartments are given to their owners. In the semi-condominium method, the condominium is partly built and once the agreement is settled, the apartments are given to the owners. In the case of a Condominium Property, the approval is being obtained. But when these developers get the plan approved they have to abide by certain rules and regulations. These include the expanse of the site and the number of floors. 
One main issue we have is that when developers are given approval to build five floors, they end up building six or seven, Mrs. Jayasundara further explained. Once they get the approval they need to get the Certificate of Conformity (COC) from the land registry and then get approval from the Condominium Management Authority (CMA). One major issue we have come across is that in most instances, these developers have no idea about these condominium plans. Once the approvals have been given, the Fire Brigade also comes in for supervision and this has been done in the past few years. In certain condominiums, there is no ventillation and the apartment blocks are extremely small. Nowadays even a two-storey building is a condominium and there are various criteria that need to be fulfilled before being given out to owners.
Common elements are a must: CMA General Manager
Speaking to the , CMA General Manager, R.K. Jayaweera said there were various common elements that need to be taken into consideration when building a condominium. This includes the staircase, slabs and public places within the building complex. Initially we need a plan that gives an in-detail outline about the specifications of each unit. This has to be extended to each floor and likewise a condominium plan needs to be designed. Along with this plan, the architectural design, condominium survey plan and deed have to be submitted to the CMA. When these documents are in order, a Preliminary Clearance Certificate is required to get the approval from the Urban Development Authority (UDA). In addition to this certificate, the following documents are also required : 

Condominium survey plan 
	Approval of the building 
	Architectural drawing 
	Structural engineering certificate 
	Electrical engineering certificate 
	Fire certificate (approved by the Fire Brigade) 
Without these documents the building cannot be registered at the land registry, Jayaweera said. When asked about The Excellency building which collapsed in Wellawatte recently, he said they hadnt got any approval including the necessary certificates prior to the construction.

Supporting the key operational areas of IT and Finance, the Oracle Cloud eliminates capital expenditure on hardware and reduces support costs and upgrades.
Furthermore, even though data safety is ensured with the tight security available on the Oracle Cloud, in keeping with local regulations, customer information will be stored within the banks servers and is therefore confidential and secure.
The Planning Department of DFCC, entrusted with planning and budgeting resources across branches and departments to offer a wide range of products and services drives the Oracle planning and budgeting solution to benefit the entire bank.
The Customer Profitability Analytics (CPA) system on the other hand consolidates customer information across multiple systems at DFCC, giving decision-makers a 360-degree view of the customer, which is every banks aspiration, but very few achieve.
As a result, the Bank will have better customer information and insights leading to a positive impact on developing durable customer relationships and customer linking capabilities. Further, it will also improve employee productivity and enhance the overall productivity of the bank while managing risk and regulatory thresholds. Built on Oracle Business Intelligence technology it was implemented jointly by the Integrated Risk Management unit of DFCC Bank and Synapsys.With DFCCs transformation into a fully-fledged commercial bank,and the expected growth of the network, Synapsys solution &Oracle platform will help the Bank to offer customers enhanced financial solutions more efficiently.

Edu. Min. issues synthetic text books: GMOA
	
The Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) today claimed that the Education Ministry has distributed among students text books printed on synthetic paper causing health hazards to children aged below 12.
GMOA Assistant Secretary Haritha Aluthge told a news conference said the Education Ministry had printed more than 500,000 Geography text books at a cost of Rs.150 million for use by grade seven without considering the recommendations of the National Planning Department (NPD).
We believe that more than 200,000 books may have been already issued to students, he said.
Dr. Aluthge said Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam had submitted a Cabinet paper but the NPD rejected the proposal.
The Education Ministry has not conducted a field study on finance, technical, environmental and health before going ahead on the pilot project. NPD has said the books may cause health issues among students below the age of 12, he said and added the chemicals used in the manufacture of synthetic paper could cause shortage of breath, eye diseases and skin problems.

In 1992, Sanjeewa Adhikari, at the age of just 20 years, suffered an accident which left him visually impaired. Undeterred, Sanjeewa continued his higher studies, where he entered the University of Sri Jayawardenapura, Colombo with a Bachelor of Arts special degree in Political Science. In 2004 Sanjeewa received an appointment as a development officer of the Department of Social Service. In recognition of Sanjeewas determination and spirit, he was presented with the opportunity to follow a Shiatsu therapeutic training programme for the visually impaired in Japan, with the assistance of the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA). Following a comprehensive training, Sanjeewa returned to the island where he started his career as an instructor at the Vocational Training Centre in Seeduwa. He has trained nearly 20 visually impaired who are working as Shiatsu therapists in several institutes and clinics.
Through Parliamentary Act No 09 of 1992 to establish a fund for visually impaired persons, the government has initiated various services in support of disabled persons. One such initiative, the Visually Handicapped trust fund is implemented by the Ministry of Social Services. The mission of this fund is to provide services needed to the visually handicapped, for rehabilitation and to provide relief. It is evident that authorities are attempting to create equal opportunities for visually impaired persons. However Sanjeewa laments that even with such assistance some of his trainees find it difficult to lead a comfortable lif e with the ever-increasing expenses.
There are several vocational training facilities in Sri Lanka for the visually impaired, sponsored by the Ministry of Social Services. There are several programmes launched by the Social Services Department to assist those like us. For women, there is a programme to train them in handlooms and textile weaving. For men, the programmes include training in local manufacturing products such as coir products. The Shiatsu therapeutic massage training programme was introduced as a vocation for visually handicapped men, as it is an age old medical tradition practised by the blind in Japan. But in Sri Lanka, this tradition is unfortunately perceived with negative connotations,
Sanjeewa revealed.
At the Seeduwa Training Centre where Sanjeewa imparts his knowledge to those who are similarly disadvantaged, groups of four to six undergo a Shiatsu training programme annually. With the batch who just completed their training, I have served as an instructor for 15 therapists. Some of them are employed at institutes while some practise this therapy on their own, Sanjeewa said.
Dhanushka Prabath, another visually impaired Shiatsu therapist who completed training under Sanjeewa, says that even though their training was completed, their career is full of challenges. We have learned that in other countries such as the United States or even China, this form of therapy is a well respected one. However in Sri Lanka, people have a bad perception of it. People have confused our tradition with other massage techniques. But the Shiatsu therapeutic massage belongs to a branch of oriental medicine. It is used to alleviate many ailments in the body and also used for relaxation. It can be performed while the patient is clothed and in an open space, Prabath said. Prabath with the assistance of a colleague who completed the Shiatsu training programme conducts this therapy for a nominal fee every day, at the Nawala Jogging path.
However Prabath did not fail to mention that taking approval from authorities for his practice at the path was not easy, as they suspected his therapy to be a hoax.
The ethical form of therapy is practised by 15 visually impaired individuals who have been trained through the Department of Social Services, at various locations. However the challenges that await these victims of fate do not stop with their handicaps. They too have to deal with meaningless stigma and disapproval of society over things they have little or nocontrol over.
Those who wish to contact these healers with kind hearts can contact Prabath on 011-2721586 or Sanjeewa on 0714451862

What is Shiatsu therapeutic massage
Shiatsu is an age old Japanese healing therapy. It has the ability to cure specific injuries as well as the general symptoms of poor health such as headache, shoulder pain, back and lower back pain. It is also a way of providing deep relaxation therapy to alleviate mental stress.
It has been helpful in treating ailments such as fatigue, headache, constipation, insomnia and many others.
In Japan, Shiatsu is a common and age old practice for the visually impaired. The form of therapy naturally favours the blind because of their advanced sense of touch. When mastered under proper guidance, the blind can practise it as a form of self-employment, which helps them earn a living and provides them an opportunity to contribute to the society.
The core principle of Shiatsu is the vital energy [Ki in Japanese] that flows throughout the body in connected channels called meridians. Ki can stop flowing freely owing to many reasons, producing symptoms that can then be healed by Shiatsu.

## Title: " I DID NOT LIE"

" I DID NOT LIE"
	

Every year, thousands of Sri Lankan women brave the desert, leaving behind almost everything, just so they could send their hard-earned money to their loved ones back here. Most of them toil as maids in the Middle East. While many of them are, if not happy, satisfied, with their employment, their earnings take shape of a major source of foreign income to the island. Often tabled are reports of maids being held in an unknown territory against their will; many of them return home with physical and mental bruisers as a result of ill-treatment and torture.

W.W. Indrakanthi belongs to the unfortunate faction. It was only last month she returned home with severe governmental intervention, after a video clip in which she claims she was held against her will and her employer demanded her kidney went viral. Now, she has been accused of making a bogus claim by more than one source. We at Daily mirror interviewed Indra Kanthi to inquire her side of the story.

The following is Indra Kanthis account of what she endured whilst employed abroad.
Two years ago, Withanagoda Wattage Indra Kanthi (36), a single mother of three girls aged eighteen, eleven and seven, considered foreign employment as her last resort. After her husband deserted his wife and the children for another woman, Indra Kanthi was burdened with loans and the future of her children. With an education only up to Grade ten, Indra Kanthi decided to go abroad as a house maid in search of greener pastures -- to overcome the severe financial constraints and secure a bright future for her children.
As such, she boarded her flight on March 14, 2015, leaving behind her family in the care of her mother, to do the chores of an unknown family. She was however not worried about herself as she had once worked as a house maid in the same country, and the experience turned out to be better than she anticipated. She contacted the same agency for the same reason and she was piloted to her destination through a private visa sponsored by the employer. According to her, things had been very difficult at her new workplace from day one. 
Even though they said I had to work for one family only, I had to do the work of several families related to my employer. I didnt have allocated working hours as such. From the moment I woke up, which was before 7 a.m., to the moment I went back to sleep, which was around 2 a.m., I worked continuously; cooking, cleaning and washing for ten or more people. I was not given proper food and even though I am ashamed to reveal, there were many occasions where I took empty utensils and scraped off the remaining rice (dankuda) to satisfy my hunger. I was hospitalised more than once and was given saline because I was physically weak. They didnt give me my salary on date. I had to beg for my salary which I had to send home, to my mother and children who depended solely on my meager earnings. Once, I had a severe chest pain and even found it difficult to talk to my employer. Although it is the employers responsibility to look into the medical needs of a maid, I was never taken to a doctor until the agency called them from Sri Lanka and told them to. 
Complaints of physical abuse are not uncommon in returnees from the Middle East. Did she have to go through that particular challenge 
The first time a woman of the household hit me, I called the agency. They called my sponsors and advised them not to do so in future. They didnt hit me again until towards the end, when a son of my employer slapped me for asking to let me go home, she confessed. 
Speaking about her employers demand for her kidney, she said her employer offered money for her kidney. 
Indra Kanthi with two of her daughters

There was an old lady in the house. She was feeble and suffered from diabetes. About two months before my contract expired, they discovered her need for a kidney transplant.
They started looking for donors everywhere. They asked me to donate a kidney and offered 50,000 Riyals (approximately LKR 2 million). When I refused, they asked me to reconsider.
They kept nagging me, asking if I changed my decision. I always said no. 
During the last couple of months, they approached me again and said they would give me a thumping amount of money. My answer was still no. When I explained to them that it would be difficult for me to work and take care of my family after the surgery, they told I did not have to return to Sri Lanka but could settle down in Saudi with a man they would find for me with my money. I vehemently refused. 
When we asked if she were told that she was held because she refused to donate the kidney, she said: No. They never put it like that. Even though I was being forced to stay in the house after my contract period expired, with them having asked for the kidney and with the day of the surgery approaching, I felt really scared, said Indrakanthi. 
When asked if she underwent any tests for kidney donation, she said: No, I didnt. They asked me my blood group and even though I knew it, I told them I didnt, for the fear of being forced to donate my kidney if it were the correct type. More than once they attempted to take me for tests, saying it will only consume a little time, but I refused. 

She speaks about the difficult times she had after her contract expired: Even though my contract was for two years, they did not allow me to leave once it was over. In the last three months of my stay, they did not pay me my salary, preventing me from going home. I had to borrow money from a Sri Lankan friend who worked in another house to recharge my phone to call home. This is when I tried contacting the Sri Lankan Embassy in Saudi Arabia for the first time. To my dismay, I found that none of the embassy numbers given to us by the SLFEB before departure could be contacted.
So I contacted an embassy officer through a number the agency person had given me. She told me that in order for them to help, I had to first make a complaint at a Sri Lankan branch of the foreign employment bureau. Even after doing that through my mother, the officer kept making excuses to not come and get me. For three weeks, each time I called the officer on the day she promised to come for me, she made various excuses not to come. She was quite impatient with me when I called, and yelled saying I was not the only woman they have to look into, and to be patient until they arrive. Later, she stopped answering my calls. 


Meanwhile, the family of the old lady was saying the day of the surgery was quite close and that they havent found a donor yet. With them not allowing me to leave and the embassy not responding, I was frightened and became desperate. That was when I decided to involve the media. My final message in the form of a video. 
When asked if the foreign employment bureau was involved in her rescue, Indra Kanthi responded negatively. 
I was contacted by a person working at a Sri Lankan media institution and he gave me the number of the Sri Lankan Ambassador in Saudi. He was quite nice to me when I contacted him over the phone and promised to get me out within two days. He kept his word. 
Indra Kanthis account of what happened at the police station is however somewhat different to that of Sri Lanka Foreign Employment Bureau (SLFEB), whose source, according to them was the Sri Lankan Embassy of Saudi Arabia. 
The police confiscated my phone and after going through the video I sent home, they said keeping something like that in the phone was wrong, and deleted it then and there. Then, the people from the household said they would only be able to give me one months salary because Baaba (sponsor) had gone abroad. They urged me to remain at the police station for at least a week until his return to settle the dues. Confused, I grilled them about this new name, Baaba. The name they said was the name of my Mama (mistress) who had not gone anywhere but was at home.


When I mentioned it to them, they ignored me. I didnt want to stay another week at the police so I agreed to get only one months salary and the return ticket. Even though they have to pay for my return ticket, they paid only 600 Riyals and the rest I had to bear. Before being released, I had to sign a letter the police gave me, which was in Arabic language, Indra Kanthi narrated. 
In addition to having signed a letter in a language that she doesnt even comprehend, Indra Kanthi had been asked for another letter by the people of her own country too, according to her confession.
At the embassy, I was asked to write a letter saying I was rescued by two personnel from the ambassadors office and that Im withdrawing my claim about not receiving two months salaries. After reading this, the embassy officer asked me to add that I will withdraw my accusation about my employers demand for my kidney. So I appended that sentence to the already signed letter. 
Were the Saudi Police going to take any action on her for defaming the country as the SLFEB has suggested I dont know anything like that. No one mentioned about taking legal action against me at that time, was her reply. 
The approached SLFEB Deputy General Manager Madhawa Deshapriya to inquire his stance on the incident
Actually, this is not a recent development but has happened when our embassy officers have gone to the police to rescue her. In addition to the video that was released to the media, she has sent home some other clips too. The police have said by sending videos carrying the message that the Saudi employer have threatened to take her kidney by force, she has insulted the government and that the police is taking legal action against her. Our officers have settled the matter with the police, talking on her behalf saying that she had only made that claim to go home, and by apologising for her, he said. 
Meanwhile, we asked Indra Kanthi about the accusation that she had gone abroad illegally. 
I used the same agency located in Armour Street that I used the previous time, trusting the madam there. When my family had contacted the relevant government authority, they have sent a foreign employment officer from the divisional secretariat office and she called me saying I have gone abroad through illegal means. That was the first time I heard about it. They said I have been registered under an agency I have never heard about. The madam in the agency, who helped me by giving the number of the embassy, avoided me later. She didnt answer my calls. I dont have any relevant papers with me, since I have been recruited through a private visa and I didnt directly sign an employment contract with my employers. Daily Mirrors efforts to contact the said agent were not successful. 
We asked her about the allegations by the SLFEB saying she had made a false claim about her employer demanding her kidney. 
All I have to say is that Im telling the truth. The embassy and SLFEB are accusing me to prevent shedding light on the fact that they did not intervene on my behalf. Had they responded aptly the first time I complained to the embassy, I wouldnt have undergone so much trauma, she said. 
She ended her conversation with a plea to the government on behalf of the Sri Lankan women travelling to Saudi Arabia among many hardships: Women should not be sent to Saudi Arabia in the first place because it is not a good country for a woman to work. Even though there are some employers who treat them really well, some others treat our women like animals. 
Speaking for the women who are already employed in Saudi Arabia, she stresses the importance of government intervention with regard to women in distress. We are alone with no one to turn to. In a foreign country, the embassy is the only place we can lodge our complaints. Therefore, at the first complaint itself, take necessary action to address the situation, she appealed. 
When we contacted the SLFEB Deputy General Manager to inquire the injustice meted out by forcibly detaining Indra Kanthi for two months after her contract expired, the Deputy General Manager said according to what they knew, she had been asked by the employer to remain until a replacement was made. When inquired about the legality of offering money to donate her kidney, his reply was that he didnt know the legal background of the organ donation procedure in that country. 
Our readers should note that according to Indra Kanthis account, in addition to being offered money for a body organ, which equals to organ trade (a punishable offence in Sri Lanka), the employer has done it when she was under their authority. Looking back at the SLFEB officials statement, it is unfortunate that the embassy and the SLFEB that were quick to point fingers at the Sri Lankan maid saying she had made false accusations, being ignorant about the legal background of a situation where her employers may have done something illegal and unethical with their offer for an organ. 

There also lies the question of the agency she used to go abroad. Indra Kanthi says the SLFEB had said she was sent abroad via illegal means. If so, has any action been taken against the agency The government should look into her complaint over the inability to contact the embassy via the channels that were provided to her and every other woman who goes to Saudi Arabia; there may be many women who are in dire situations and whose only means of escape may be a call to the embassy. Indra Kanthi had been informed that she couldn't contact the embassy through landlines as the officials were always busy. Even if it were a matter as simple as that, it may decide the life of another woman out there. 
Finally, even after contacting the embassy, their inability to improve her situation until Indra Kanthi approached the ambassador directly, highlights her story. If the ambassador was able to take her out within two days as promised, why have the other embassy officials been unable to achieve the same feat the numerous times Indra Kanthi contacted them 
Indra Kanthi is reunited with her family and in a few more days, her confession will become just another story amongst the many horrors of Sri Lankan maids who have suffered at the hands of their employers in faraway lands. Whether we should use this information to prevent the occurrence of another incident with worse outcomes is in our hands.

Measures taken to uphold independence of judiciary: SL
	
Responding to former UN Special Rapporteur Mnica Pintos report on the country, Sri Lanka on Monday said it has taken a number of important steps to uphold the independence of the judiciary and lawyers.
Sri Lanka's Ambassador and Permanent Representative to Geneva Ravinatha P. Aryasinha told the UN Human Rights Councils 35th Regular Session that these positive measures were taken after the Presidential Election of January 2015.
Former UN Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers Mnica Pintos report, which highly criticized the judiciary of Sri Lanka, was presented to the council by her successor Diego Garca-Sayn.
Ambassador Aryasinha said the Sri Lankan Parliament enacted the 19th Amendment to the Constitution introducing constitutional safeguards to uphold the independence of the judiciary and the bar.
The most significant among these are: safeguards to the process of appointment of senior judges; appointment of the Attorney-General, the Attorney-Generals Department, and appointment of the members of the Judicial Services Commission, he said.

Synthetic text books: GMOA claims are baseless
	
Rejecting claims made by Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) about school text books printed on synthetic paper, Assistant Commissioner General of the Educational Publications Department I.M.K.B. Ilangasinghe said the new text books did not cause health hazards.
GMOAs Assistant Secretary Haritha Aluthge today claimed that the Education Ministry had distributed synthetic paper text books among students causing health hazards to children below 12 years of age.
He claimed the Education Ministry had printed more than 500,000 Geography text books at a cost of Rs.150 million to be used by grade seven students without considering the recommendations of the National Planning Department (NPD).
Mr. Ilangasinghe told the Daily Mirror, the Education Ministry had printed Polypropylene material books under the certificate of a doctor appointed by the Health Ministry and the Environmental Authority.
The doctor had confirmed the synthetic paper text books were not harmful to children. The papers were imported from Japan under the SGS Certification. SGS is the world's leading inspection, verification, testing and certification company, recognised as the global benchmark for quality and integrity, he said.
SGS Certification confirms that a product does not contain any heavy metal that is harmful to childrens health.
Even the Industrial Technology Institute (ITI) has given the same certificate, he said.
The ink that is used to print the books is not toxic, therefore it is not hazardous even if a child occidentally consumed it. All the pages are fully laminated. Therefore, the books will not be damaged by water, Mr. Ilangasinghe said.
He said the books could be used for five years. The usual textbooks that are given to school children cannot be used more than one year.
The Education Ministry distributed 500,000 books to school children as a pilot project since January this year.
He said so far no complaints have been received by the Ministry except for the GMOA.
The claims made by the GMOA are false and baseless, he said. (Chaturanga Pradeep)

Before being appointed as a consultant, this fair one had worked in a healthcare service and had been a frequent visitor to the provincial high-up while in office. And the office aides had found them necking there on several occasions.

Three-wheeler, bicycle accidents on the rise: Minister
	
There had been an increase in three-wheeler and bicycle accidents during the past two years, Transport Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva said addressing the media at the Ministry this evening.
Minister Silva said that a total of 134 deaths and 142 accidents had been reported in 2016, while 147 deaths and 134 accidents were reported in 2017 to date.
Considering the two years, the number of accidents involving three-wheelers had increased. Accidents involving cars and buses have decreased, the Minister said.
Therefore, the Ministry had decided to launch an awareness campaign and a training programme for three-wheeler drivers.
The Ministry had decided to launch a special programme for a group of 200 three-wheeler driving licence applicants at the Werahera branch of the Department of Motor Traffic, he said.
He said therefore the Ministry had increased the threshold of driving age to 35 years for three-wheelers drivers.
These regulations are expected to be brought for the safety of the lives of the passengers and for the security of the drivers, he added.
The licence will only allow passengers in the vehicle. They cant transport goods, he said.
The Minister said there would be stricter regulations.
One will have to get a special passenger transport licence to transport people.
The Department of Motor Traffic, the Police Department, Department of Attorney General, and the Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation would work together to form a national policy on three-wheelers with the support of other stake holders. (Chaturanga Pradeep)

UN Rapporteurs report hammers SL judiciary
	
The report by former UN Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers, Mnica Pinto based on her mission to Sri Lanka last year, was tabled to the UN Human Rights Council yesterday and the report highly criticized Sri Lankas justice system.
The report, which was compiled by Ms. Pinto following her mission to Sri Lanka from April 29 to May 7 last year, was tabled by new Rapporteur Diego Garca-Sayn at the ongoing 35th session of the UNHRC.
Tabling the report Mr. Garca-Sayn said although the armed conflict was concluded in 2009, very deep wounds could still be seen in the judicial system.
He said there have been reforms and some steps forward but gradual worsening of the situation in the judiciary during the armed conflict was visible.
Quoting the report, he said there was a lack of equal representation of minority groups in the prosecution services and police force. Problems related to language are very serious and have a very serious effect on justice and on the likelihood of obtaining a fair process if you belong to the Tamil community, he said.
He said authorities were urged to put in place transitional justice mechanism to tackle the past comprehensively and stress was made that there ought to be impartial, credible and effective authorities working in this transition process.
Ms. Pinto in her report said the language problems have a dramatic impact on access to justice and respect for fair trial and due process guarantees for Tamil-speaking people, and need to be addressed urgently.
Commenting on the Bar Association of Sri Lanka, she said it has been during certain periods strongly divided along political lines.
She said she was told of judicial delays that were nothing short of dramatic and criminal proceedings could drag on for 10 to 15 years, even in cases that were not politically sensitive.
For instance, a lawyer mentioned being involved in a trial for rape that had recently been completed after 15 years. There were also examples of civil cases that had been pending for more than 30 years. Divorce matters could take eight or more years to be resolved. Such delays clearly amount to a denial of justice, which especially affects the lives of victims, their families and persons deprived of their liberty, she said adding the Attorney-Generals department also largely contributed to judicial delays.
The report said the Special Rapporteur was told that judges frequently pushed defendants to plead guilty.
Defendants were made to believe they could get a lighter sentence by pleading guilty, which was not always the case, and that their sentence would be shorter than the time they would spend in pretrial detention. When defendants plead guilty, judges can expedite their case and improve their statistics. The Special Rapporteur is alarmed by this practice, which seems to demonstrate a disregard for the interests of justice, it said.
It said the victim and witness protection would continue to be a determining issue in the context of common crimes, abuses and violations committed by members of the security forces, as well as in the context of transitional justice mechanisms that have been created, such as the Office of Missing Persons, or that will be established, such as a truth-seeking mechanism or specialized court.
Referring to impunity, the report said it was widespread and that it has become a normal occurrence, thereby contributing to shattering the publics confidence in its judiciary.
Since the change of government, some positive steps seem to have been taken, as five new cases were reportedly being investigated at the time of the visit, it said.
In conclusion, the 20-page long report said while the democratic gains of the past two years must be welcomed, it is important to recognize that much more could and should have been done to manifest a commitment to genuine reform, in particular in the justice sector, and to create a meaningful and participatory transitional justice mechanisms.
Building a justice system that all sectors of society will trust and be able to rely on to defend and enforce their rights will take time. Bold steps need to be taken, as a sign of the authorities commitment to address the atrocities of the past and, above all, the structures that allowed such atrocities to happen. It is important to remember that justice must not merely be done, but must also be seen to be done, the report said.
Making at least 49 recommendations, Ms. Pinto said the practice of plea bargaining should be clearly regulated in legislation, defendants should never be pressured into pleading guilty and should be informed in a language they understand of all the consequences and implications of pleading guilty.
While urging the repeal of the Prevention of Terrorism Act, the report said the authorities should study the backlog of tribunals and analyse the causes of judicial delays to design a comprehensive plan to improve the efficiency of the administration of justice, legislation should be urgently amended to allow every person arrested or detained to have access to a lawyer of his or her choice from the moment of arrest, an independent special office should be established to handle the prosecution of State officials and urgent measures should be taken to allow people from different sectors of society to be part of the justice system and to have access to it.
A code of conduct for judges, in line with international standards such as the Bangalore Principles of Judicial Conduct, should be set up. The Attorney-Generals appointment should be clearly set out in law and include objective selection criteria, any impeachment procedure should be regulated by a law passed by Parliament, the composition of the Constitutional Council should balance the number of politicians with representation from civil society, the Constitutional Council should set out and publish its rules of procedures, including the criteria used to evaluate candidates suitability for a given position, which should be scrupulously and consistently applied, were among the recommendations.(Lahiru Pothmulla)
