Karunanidhi condemns U.S. stand on Sri Lanka
	
The U.S. government?s decision to support the new Sri Lankan government?s plans for a local inquiry into alleged wartime atrocities has evoked strong criticism from DMK leader M. Karunanidhi and PMK founder S. Ramadoss.
?The U.S. government?s move looks as if it wants to cover up the war crimes. I hope it will not happen. If Sri Lanka is allowed to conduct its own inquiry, the DMK will strongly condemn the U.S.,? Mr. Karunanidhi said in a statement.
Dr. Ramadoss said that though he was pained by the decision of the U.S. government, he was not surprised because he had expected it.
?I have been saying that we should not trust the U.S. as it would not hesitate to betray the interest of Tamils. My stand has been vindicated now,? he said.
Even the new Prime Minister of Sri Lanka, Ranil Wickermesinghe, could not get justice for the Tamils as it was during his regime that efforts were made for the final war against the Tamils.
?The only ray of hope is the United Nations Human Rights Council. It should ensure that an international inquiry is ordered into the war crimes,? Dr. Ramadoss said.(The Hindu)

Making candidates account for campaign funds a must during polls: PAFFREL
	
Local election watchdog People's Action for Free and Fair Elections (PAFFREL) yesterday said strict election laws should be introduced to make it compulsory for candidates to maintain only one bank account for election campaigning.
PAFFREL Executive Director Rohana Hettiarachchi said candidates should declare the account to the Elections Commissioner (EC) and must also be required to reveal their campaign expenses once the election was over. ?Candidates should only utilize this account for their campaign expenses. Once the election was over, they should publish the summary of their campaigning expenses to the EC with details of who had funded their campaign and how they did it,? he said.
Mr. Hettiarachchi reiterated that laws should be introduced through the 20th Amendment to the Constitution to limit the election campaign expenditure of a candidate.
He said a candidate could easily get away with withholding taxes from the authorities including the Inland Revenue Department by claiming that their campaign was carried out with the funds received from friends.
?This is why we need a threshold for campaign expenses. There is already one such mechanism being used in Bangladesh where candidates are only allowed to spend a limited amount of money to woo one voter in their electorate. We too should have such a method in Sri Lanka,? he said.(Lahiru Pothmulla)

JVP?s Mayadunne to resign?
	
Authoritative sources confirm that JVP National List MP Sarathchandra Mayadunne is due to resign from his position as MP after swearing-in when Parliament convenes.
However when contacted Mayadunne told Daily Mirror Online that he cannot confirm the reports and added, ?This is a matter that should be directly reported to Parliament first ? therefore I will refrain from commenting as I believe it is unethical.? ?
But he confirmed he will be swearing-in and noted that he would make a special statement in Parliament afterwards.
Meanwhile it has been pointed out that former Auditor General Mayadunne?s decision to step down as a National list MP is due to certain groups who have called for his resignation citing the ?importance of upholding the people?s mandate?. ?
JVP sources claim however that Mayadunne has not conveyed such a decision to the party as of yet and added that they wished for him to continue in his position as one of their two national list MPs alongside Sunil Handunnetti. (LP)

No glitches at BOC in Seychelles
	
Bank of Ceylon Chairman Ronald Perera said yesterday the Seychelles branch of the BOC was functioning smoothly and there were no any grey areas in its setting up process in January 2014.
He told Daily Mirror the Bank had launched an inquiry on the circumstances that led to the establishment of the branch because of allegations of wrong doings.
?We inquired into allegations that the BOC branch in Seychelles was established in haste and with ulterior motives. The inquiry report has found nothing irregular and we are fully satisfied with the setting up process and the management of the branch,? Mr. Perera said.
He said there was no question of closing or any threat of bankruptcy at the branch.
The then Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake ordered an inquiry to find out if Sri Lankans had deposited ill-gotten funds at the branch in Seychelles, which is considered a tax haven.
Questions were asked why the BOC opened a branch at Seychelles when only 46 Sri Lankans were living there. There were allegations that this branch was opened for the purpose of money laundering.
Mr. Karunanayake also said the investigation would help reveal whether the opening of the branch was authorised by the Finance Minister or Central Bank Governor during the Rajapaksa regime.
The branch opened on January 20, 2014 was the first ever Bank of Ceylon branch in an African country. Seychelles Vice President Danny Faure was the chief guest at the opening ceremony.(Sandun A Jayasekera)
