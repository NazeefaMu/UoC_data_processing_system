Cant make me silent: Gammanpila
	
Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) General Secretary Udaya Gammanpila was summoned by the Police Special Investigation Unit (SIU) today to record a statement over a complaint that he had used an allegedly fraudulent Power of Attorney to sell shares of an Australian company.
Mr. Gammanpila, on his way to the SIU, refuted the charges as being politically motivated and said it was a surprise that the charge comes after 18 and a half years later of signing of the said Power of Attorney.
The Power of Attorney had been signed by Brian Shaddick, the owner of the company and two other witnesses. Though I recognise Brians signature, it is not possible for me to know the names, signatures, addresses and other details of the two witnesses, he told the media outside the SIU.
He said the complaint had been changed constantly raising doubts on the credibility of the compliant and charged action of the Police into the matter was partial.
Ministers of the Government criticised the Bribery Commission officials for visiting former President Mahinda Rajapaksa at his residence to record a statement. But, the Police had travelled to Australia twice to record a statement from Brian Shaddick. Though, they had travelled there, not once tried to contact the two witnesses mentioned in the Power of Attorney, he charged.
Mr. Gammanpila also said the complaint, which was first lodged with the CID had been later handed over to the SIU on a request by the complainant.
It seems a complainant could chose an entity of their choice, he said.
He charged a Minister was behind the complaint against him and said both the Police and the politicians were attempting to make him silent.
They cant make us silent. They may put us in jail but they cant stop our struggle, he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Jumbo calf raised at Uda Walawa
	
The elephant calf that had been rescued from an uncovered drain in Hambantota would not be reunited with its mother but would be raised at the Elephant Transit Home in Uda Walawe for three to four years, Wild Life Conservation Department officials said today.
Speaking to the Daily Mirror, Wild Life Health Management Director Dr. Tharaka Prasad rejected reports on the release of the elephant calf to a temple by the WLCD.
However, Dr. Prasad said the mother elephant had refused to feed the baby elephant after it was taken into the Uda Walawe Elephant Transit Home for treatment for fracture in its leg.
The elephant is still being treated for its broken leg by our doctors. According to its age, the baby elephant should be fed by its mother. However, we are feeding it to meet the nutrients it needs. It will be kept at the Transit Home until it grows enough to live alone in the wild, Dr. Tharaka said.
WLCD Media Spokesman Hasini Sarachchandra said there was no need to carry out an inquiry on how the baby elephant got stuck in the drain, because Hambantota, where the Habour and the Airport are located was a region where hundreds of wild elephants roam freely. (Piyumi Fonseka)

Sri Lanka asked to remove flag from Lord's balcony
	
MCC instructed the Sri Lankan dressing room to remove their national flag from the team balcony on Sunday after the tourists unfurled it in protest at an umpiring decision.
Sri Lanka complained to the match referee after seam bowler Nuwan Pradeep was deprived of the wicket of Alex Hales because umpire Rod Tucker had wrongly signalled a no-ball.
Not long after, the Sri Lankan flag was draped over the railings of their balcony, where it stayed  in contravention of ground rules  for nearly 45 minutes.
It needed an intervention from MCC to have it removed, but not before Sri Lanka Cricket President Thilanga Sumathipala had given team management permission to display the flag.
Meanwhile, team officials visited match referee Andy Pycroft to ask why Tucker  who later apologised to Sri Lanka  called a no-ball when replays showed part of Pradeep's heel behind the line a split second before he bowled Hales, who had 58 at the time and went on to make 94.
Sri Lanka coach Graham Ford said: 'It just seems strange with technology available that you can still get a line call wrong.'
Sumathipala said the presence of the flag was a show of solidarity: 'It was to say, 'Boys get together'. We're not happy with the decision, but your country is more important.'
Graham Ford, the Sri Lanka coach, said: 'It just seems strange with technology available that you can still get a line call wrong. Surely we can get to the point where that problem can be taken out of cricket.' (Daily Mail)

Presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump said in a statement on Sunday that President Barack Obama should resign.
The statement came after a mass shooter at an Orlando nightclub killed at least 50 people and wounded 53 others.
In his remarks today, President Obama disgracefully refused to even say the words Radical Islam, Trump wrote. For that reason alone, he should step down.
In his brief address earlier Sunday, Obama said the shooting was an act of terror and an act of hate.
Trump also criticized Hillary Clinton, the presumptive Democratic nominee, in his statement. (Telegraph)

UNHR Chief calls for inclusive engagement of all Lankans
	
While addressing the 32nd Human Rights Council session in Geneva today, United Nations Human Rights High Commissioner Zeid Raad Al Hussein said a comprehensive strategy will be required to implement the governments commitments in the resolution on Sri Lanka.
On his global update on human rights, the High Commissioner commented on human right concerns all over the world including in Sri Lanka as well as the US.
In Sri Lanka, the governments efforts to implement its commitments in Resolution 30/1 will require a comprehensive strategy on transitional justice that enables it to pursue different processes in a coordinated, integrated and appropriately sequenced manner. This will require the inclusive and meaningful engagement of all Sri Lankans. I will present an oral update later in the session, he said. 
In his speech, the High Commissioner said respect for human rights offers countries a path towards greater stability and that his office offers assistance in establishing that path in all humility.
We shed light on protection gaps in order to help States repair them. I urge you to assist our work, and to avail yourselves of the help we offer. Despite the often terrible trends that I have outlined in this discussion, I firmly believe that it is not yet too late to act, he said.

Union Assurance March quarter down over fair value losses, higher expenses

Commercial Bank of Ceylons participation in a groundbreaking initiative in Sri Lankas tea plantation sector to automate the process of procurement of tea leaves and settlement for bought leaf will result in sophisticated technology and banking services reaching a largely underserved segment.
Sri Lankas largest private bank has been designated the Preferred Bank for the issue of the first hybrid debit card coupled with Sony FeliCa Near Field Communication (NFC) technology in the market, enabling its promoter Smart Metro (Pvt.) Ltd to deploy a debit card cum identification card for tea leaf suppliers.
Armed with these personalised cards linked to savings accounts at Commercial Bank, tea leaf suppliers can simply tap their cards on the data acquisition device to promptly identify each supplier through NFC technology and to obtain a detailed receipt for the weight of the leaves supplied. All data required for automatic calculation of the payments to leaf suppliers are instantly transmitted to a central server by the data acquisition device.
The server generates a file with fund transfer instructions, which will be forwarded to Commercial Bank to credit monies earned, to the accounts of the cardholders. The account holders may thereafter withdraw the money they require from the ATMs of the bank or at branch counters. Alternatively they can also use the card to pay for purchase of goods and services.
As a bank that is committed to technology-enabled convenience, we are delighted to be the banking partner for this exciting new development, Commercial Bank Managing Director/CEO Jegan Durairatnam said.
It is always stimulating to push the boundaries of technology with ingenious new creations like hybrid cards and for the bank there is the added satisfaction of reaching and encouraging savings to a new and economically-important segment.
The Integrated Circuit Chip cards procured by Smart Metro carry properties for the payment card application as well as for the tea leaf collection system which is based on FeliCa technology. The NFC technology partner for Smart Metro in this venture is Sony Corporation, Japan.
Several plantation companies that purchase tea leaves from thousands of tea leaf suppliers have already expressed interest in migrating to the Smart Tea Procurement System that utilises this technology, the bank said.
A Sri Lanka-based international software development company, Smart Metro was founded at the beginning of 2011 and registered in 2013 by a team of enthusiastic specialists who wanted to introduce innovative NFC-based IT products. The company has signed two landmark agreements with Sony Corporation and Fujisoft Inc., Japan to become Sri Lankas sole agent for the distribution and application of Sonys NFC technology widely known as FeliCa and Fujisofts Finger-vein Biometric Authentication technology.

The Financial Crime Investigation Division (FCID) should not be dissolved as the UPFA too had complaints to lodge against officials of the current Government, UPFA MP Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena said.
Addressing a news conference held at former president Mahinda Rajapaksas Public Relations Office, he said they would lodge complains to the FCID against Central Bank Governor Arjuna Mahendran, as well as the Secretaries of the Finance and Defence Ministries under a UPFA government.
"We too can benefit from the FCID, therefore we don't think it should be dissolved. The FCID today summons and questions MPs with the intention of avenging. People are summoned based on bogus allegations. We do not approve this. But, if the charges are proven, action should be taken against them," he said.
Commenting on the appointment of the Central Bank Governor, he said Mr. Mahendran should not be appointed for another term and that an honest, impartial official with integrity should be appointed to the position. (Lahiru Pothmulla)
