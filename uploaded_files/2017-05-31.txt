Destroying Baddegama Bridge amidst flood situation
	
Floods and landslides which wreaked havoc in the country over the past few days did not only take away the lives and homes of the innocent, but underpinned a plethora of social complications including conflicts between the victims of these natural catastrophes and relevant government authorities.?
Amidst this tension tabled the decision to destroy the old bridge at Baddegama with explosives. This created a conflict situation between the government authorities and the villagers.?
?Representatives of relevant government authorities believe the bridge needs to be destroyed to allow the smooth flow of water from the Gin Ganga. However, the Halpatota villagers are of the opinion that destroying the bridge with explosives would have an adverse impact as a large number of houses along the river bank would be submerged,? said Manjula Gonsalkorala, a resident of the area.?
He said destroying the ancient bridge would sever an alternate route out of Halpatota, Baddegama to Colombo. Besides, the bridge had been constructed during the colonial period in 1926, he added.?
?We will keep vigil day and night to stop the authorities from destroying the bridge. However, some of the villagers say the bridge had to be destroyed as logs and debris floating along the river eventually accumulate under the bridge, thereby obstructing the free flow of water. Nevertheless, it is not worth destroying the bridge as the water flow has reduced,? Manjula said.?
Meanwhile, Baddegama Irrigation Department Field Engineer M.H. Kamaljit confirmed that the water level of Gin Ganga has receded to 6.8m compared to 7.8 m on Sunday.?
In another development, the villagers said people were cautioned of possible threats as water seeped through the Halpatota bund. People living along the banks of Gin Ganga in Baddegama panicked on Monday because of rumours that the bund will not withhold the pressure of the body of water.?
The rumour spread like wildfire stating that the bund would give away any minute and people in the area were asked to evacuate. However, the real concern was the seeping of water through the bund. Despite the sand bags acting as a guard, water tends to seep through them.?
?We were told by the fellow villagers that a radio announcement urged the people living along the Baddegama stretch to evacuate the area as the bund might burst at any moment,? said a resident who wished to remain anonymous.?
Another elderly lady who identified herself as Liyana Achchi said she too heard the story that people were asked to evacuate. ?My only worry is about when I will get to return home,? she lamented. She said those affected continued to receive dry rations and cooked food for the time being. According to Liyana Achchi, they are in need of special assistance to bring their households and livelihood back in order.?
Samarasinghe, another villager, said many of the victims in his village were asked to resettle in the lands given to them previously. Unfortunately, they had not heeded this advice.?
?They have constructed houses on these lands and rented them. They continue to live in vulnerable areas and were affected by the floods merely because of their greed,? he revealed. Samarasinghe added that these people were given relief but those who really deserve rations were deprived of any.?

?EXMO 2017? takes the country by storm
	
Revolutionising the world of technology
Eyes were opened, minds blown and the unimpressionable impressed by the talents of the young inventors of the Moratuwa University at ?EXMO 2017? which was held at the Civil Engineering Department Auditorium on April 28 and 29.
Nathan Sivagananathan, Chief Growth Officer of MAS Holdings (Pvt) Ltd, graced the occasion as the Chief Guest and Nihal Rupasinghe, Secretary to the Megapolis and Western Development Ministry as Guest of Honour.
?
Professor Kapila Perera started the opening ceremony by welcoming the various parties who had attended the event. He explained how EXMO came to being and what these projects were all about.
?The main purpose of this event is to showcase the talents of the final year undergraduates. Every student attending one of the ten departments in the university?s engineering faculty have a mandatory project in their curriculum. They have to research and come up with a product or service to present as their final year project. Most of the projects are centred around resolving social problems, and the undergraduates have to submit a synopsis and formulate their project. They need to take up leadership and develop organisational and analytical skills. They identify the problem, choreograph a research methodology through a survey, solve the problem and come up with a final product.??
He said the projects should not be limited to those attending the university.?
?Most of the time, these projects are showcased within the university to different departments. However, four years of effort and experience cannot be limited to the departments but should be criticised and critically evaluated by others. But this too does not do justice to their efforts, we have other university deans, students, people working in industries and those who are aspiring to become future engineers who need to get their queue from these products. At the end of the day, it is the general public who will be the beneficiaries because they are the investors. The main objective of EXMO is to showcase and gift the country with the undergraduates? efforts. It is to open the minds of students and the general public to a world of engineering,? he added.?
Mr. Nihal Rupasinghe, Secretary to the Megapolis and Western Development Ministry, addressed the event as the Guest of Honor. He briefed on how the future of the country and megapolis depended on the inventions of the engineering graduates.?
?The future of our country and megapolis depend on engineering graduates. People are expecting new feats, new ideas and new facilities. These kinds of ideas coming to the young mind prove that when they go out into the industries, they will create a great impact on the industries.??
?
Next in line to address the gathering was Ananda Jayawardene, Vice Chancellor of the Moratuwa University. He started off by expressing his heartfelt gratitude to all those who extended their support to make the event a resounding success. ?
?You will see award-winning exhibits, inventions and innovations of the students, the start-up and spin-off companies of the university, undergraduate and postgraduate displays in this exhibition,? said Mr. Jayawardene.He stated that EXMO 2017 was a wonderful platform with educational and learning experiences for schoolchildren. ??We invited over 10,000 schools and through the exhibition, we wish to create an interest in the minds of the students to study engineering at the Moratuwa ?University. It is a tremendous learning experience for the kids. The exhibition is not targeted at children alone. It will raise awareness of the technological advancements in our country and empower potential investors of the prototypes on display and the commercialisation of products.??
Mr. Jayawardene also mentioned about the future he envisions for the Moratuwa ?University.?
?Our mission here at the university is to be the most globally-recognised knowledge-enterprising nation in South Asia and EXMO 2017 is therefore a tremendous boost in approaching our mission.??
Addressing the gathering, Mr. Sivagananathan said, ?It is fascinating to imagine what the future holds. The timing of this exhibition with the objectives of strengthening the relationship with the industry and collaborating with them on research and innovation and showcasing what they have excites us all.??
Mr. Sivagananathan stated that developing the national economy was one of the main results that will come about from supporting this exhibition.?
?MAS is focused on innovation and I am proud that we are partnered with the university on this occasion. It is not about sponsorship, but about supporting Sri Lanka, the entrepreneurship spirit, developing the future and increasing our GDP as a country. I am confident that the youngsters here, aspiring to be future leaders through engineering, will be inspired by what they see at this exhibition.??
He said the Moratuwa University could be compared with several other universities MAS had worked with. These include MIT, Oxford and Stanford. The science and engineering faculties in Sri Lanka truly exceed their expectations as more students are developed here.?
Mr. Sivagananathan believes that our economy depends on three things: Education, entrepreneurship and innovation.?
?First and foremost is education. Due to the limited number of seats in universities, a lot of students are missing the opportunity of receiving a higher education. On average, some 242 000 students sit for the A/L exam out of which 141 000 qualify. Unemployment rates between the age of 20 and 24 is at the highest at almost 19%. There is an urgent need for graduates in certain industries. There are industries such as automation, agriculture, tourism and transport that will determine the opportunity in Sri ?Lanka.??
?Secondly, it is entrepreneurship. There is an abundance of talent in this country. Students who are graduating from this university are in demand. We ourselves have a considerate number of graduates from this university. However, we don?t see a trend of graduates moving on and starting their own businesses as opposed to being employed. MAS is willing to fund these undergraduates? businesses and projects. Only 0.7% of our final year projects get commercialised in Sri Lanka. The percentage of university projects in other countries goes up to 10-20%. Thus, there is a lack of incubators and accelerators to help inspire growth,? he added.?
Finally, he spoke about innovations. ?If you look at global innovation in depth, Sri Lanka is ranked 91. This amazes me because every student I have met in this university and many other universities in Sri ?Lanka far exceed the expectations we have. They have the opportunity to be global individuals with the opportunity to take their ideas to the market. Sri Lankans are generally conceived as conservatives and when you don?t take risks, we cannot innovate. It has not become a part of our culture, but we need to take risks.??
Mr. Sivagananathan concluded his speech by saying MAS was ready to support and encourage all innovators in their endeavors. ?My advise for aspiring young students is to be focused, be willing to learn new things and be brave, listen to your mentors, understand your consumer keeping the commercial value in mind and also move away from an innovator?s lens to an inventor?s lens, be a changed agent and I hope that we can support you globally when you want to take your idea to the market.??

## Title: Fibroids: Benign tumours that develop in the uterus
## Section: Medicine

Fibroids: Benign tumours that develop in the uterus
	
The development of fibroids is a common occurrence among women. This condition usually prevails among unmarried women or those who don?t have children. While these are benign tumours which develop in the womb, many could be removed or shrunk through various treatments. Speaking to the Mirror Health Capsule, Dr. Sanath Lanerolle, Consultant Obstetrician and Gynaecologist, explained how fibroids developed in women, the symptoms associated with them and the treatment available.
?
?
QWhat are fibroids?
Fibroids are most frequently seen in the female reproductive system. In medical terms, they are called uterine myoma, leiomyoma or fibroma. Fibroids are firm, compact tumours that develop in the uterus. Generally 40% of females in their reproductive age develop fibroids. Some 70% of them will develop fibroids during child-bearing age. Around two-thirds will have no symptoms, while one-third will have them. It?s a 99% benign tumour which means it is not associated with cancer. However, less than 1% of these tumours may be associated with cancer but this is quite rare.
?
??Q Who are in the risk group?
Those who have never had a child and those who haven?t had a child in their childbearing age are in the risk group. It is known that females of Afro-American lineage have the highest risk of developing fibroids. Some scientists are not quite sure as to the exact cause. It is also said that high levels of oestrogen is one factor that results in fibroids. This age group is between 18-50 years and even an 18-year-old could develop a fibroid. ??
?
Q What are the symptoms?
Some women who have fibroids will have no symptoms or will develop mild symptoms. A few others will also develop severe or disruptive symptoms. Some of these include : ??
?
A heavy and prolonged menstrual period ?
	Abnormal bleeding during this period ?
	Pain in the lower abdomen ?
	Frequent urination ?
	Lower back pain ?
	Pain during intercourse ?
	Enlarged abdomen ?
	A firm mass, often located near the middle of pelvis (this could be detected by the physician) ?
?
Q How can fibroids be diagnosed?
Fibroids are usually diagnosed when women are diagnosed for some other condition. Usually a fibroid could be detected during a pelvic examination coupled with an abdominal examination. Patients do not know the existence of a fibroid until it has been detected. Some of the diagnostic procedures for fibroids may include: ??
?
Trans-vaginal ultrasound scan: This is an ultrasound scan using a small instrument called a transducer that?s placed in the vagina. ?
	Trans-abdominal ultrasound scan: This is an ultrasound scan which is used to look at pelvic organs. ??
	Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI): This provides a two-dimensional view of an internal organ or structure. ?
	Hysteroscopy: through this procedure the uterine cavity is examined for any abnormal masses. ?
In addition to these procedures, fibroids could also be detected during other vaginal examinations as well. ??
?
QWhat is the tendency of Sri Lankan women to develop fibroids?
The tendency is quite high and close to 40% of women have fibroids all around the country.
?
?
Q What are the treatments?
There is medical as well as surgical treatment. Medical treatment could be through either injection or drugs and surgical treatments could include either laparoscopic or open surgery. There is another type of treatment known as uterine artery embolization, which is a minimally invasive technique. This is where the arteries supplying blood to the fibroid is identified and blocked off (embolized). If the symptoms are less, then it could be controlled by drugs but if the fibroid is larger in size, then it needs to be removed. ?
?
QCan the development of fibroids be prevented ?
There is no way this could be prevented and it is still being studied. ?

Five dead as cyclone ?Mora? batters Bangladesh
	
?
REUTERS, 30th MAY, 2017- Cyclone Mora battered Bangladesh on Tuesday, killing five people, damaging thousands of homes and ripping through a camp housing thousands of Rohingya refugees who had fled violence in Myanmar.
Authorities said they evacuated nearly 600,000 people from vulnerable areas before the storm hit the coastal district of Cox?s Bazar early Tuesday, bringing winds of up to 135 kilometres (84 miles) per hour.
Disaster management authorities told AFP five people had been killed, four of them crushed by falling trees in the area. It was not immediately clear how the fifth person died. Authorities in Cox?s Bazar said at least 17,000 homes, excluding the Rohingya shelters, had been damaged in the district, with many low-lying villages inundated by a storm surge reaching four feet (1.3 metres). Some of the worst damages were at the camps housing the 300,000 Rohingya refugees living in Cox?s Bazar, many of them in flimsy huts. The local head of the International Organisation for Migration, which coordinates relief for the refugees, said the bulk of the homes at one camp had their roofs blown off.
?We?re already in the field. At Kutupalong camp, which I am visiting now, some 60-70 percent of the plastic roofs have been blown away.?
??Some mud walls have collapsed,? Sanjukta Sahany told AFP by phone.

Gemstone shop manager arrested for selling fake gems to tourists
	
The manager of a gemstone shop in Colombo was arrested for swindling a New Zealand national of USD 2,400 by selling fake blue gemstones. ?
Police said the tourist had purchased the gemstones weighting 7.9 carats and 6.3 carats from the shop in Colombo 7, last December.
The tourist had left for Hong Kong where he discovered that the stones purchased in Sri Lanka were fake. He had then returned to the country in April and lodged a complaint with the tourist police division on April 19.
The stones, once examined by the National Gem and Jewelry Authority, was found to be stones that were painted in blue.
The suspect was remanded till June 13 by the Fort Magistrate.
Police said they had discovered a racket where tourists were sold fake stones by gem merchants. One time tourists were easy prey to such racketeers as they were unlikely to return to the country or complaint to local authorities of the deceit. (Darshana Sanjeewa)

Keeping Your Hands Clean
	
?
People these days are too busy to remember to wash their hands, believing there will be no drastic consequences. However according to Dr. Kushlani Jayatilleke, Consultant Microbiologist at the Sri Jayawardanapura General Hospital, maintaining good hand hygiene can stop the spread of infections and antibiotic-resistant bacteria. ?
?We make a lot of contact with our hands. Whenever we handle something, we handle it with our hands. So there?s a higher chance of contaminating one?s hands and there?s a higher chance of contaminating and spreading micro-organisms to somebody else through our hands,? said Dr. Jayatilleke ?
She further said, ?Maintenance of good hand hygiene is important in order to prevent the spread of infections. Many infections are transmitted through the hands. Infections are caused by micro-organisms. Some people may not have an apparent infection, which means they?re not sick but they still they may harbour micro-organisms, especially bacteria, which can sometimes be harmful to other people.? ?
Speaking of places where infections and bacteria can easily spread she said, ?When you visit patients in hospital or if you come to get treatment, be very careful. It?s not only the fact that people with infections are everywhere in hospitals but that there is antibiotic resistance. This means that bacteria and other micro-organisms develop a resistance to antibiotics and other drugs which we are using to treat people. Thus these drugs will not be effective any longer because the bacteria?s genes are changing. This is more so in hospitals. ?So when going to the hospital, we must be aware of this. Such bacteria can be found on people?s or the patient?s skin, beds and other environments in the hospital.? ?
Citing that antibiotic resistance was a major problem in the world today, Dr. Jayatilleke said, ? This year the theme for Global Hand Hygiene Day held on March 5 was ?Fight Antibiotic Resistance, It?s In Your Hands?. ??
?Hand hygiene is very very important, especially for health staff and health care workers. When they touch a patient they should not touch another without first cleaning their hands. That?s the requirement. Sometimes they forget when they?re busy, so this is what we are trying to practice and advocate,? she added. ?
She said infections too could be spread through the hands. ?Antibiotic-resistant bacteria can be transmitted from one person to another through hands. Infections are more likely to spread in a community setting. For example influenza, which is a respiratory infection. At times it can be severe and can even result in the death of a patient when they have an immunity problem. Prevention is important, because treatment-wise we don?t have much, we have a few drugs but those may not be effective because resistance is developing against these.? ?
She further said, ?Although it?s a respiratory infection, when you sneeze and cough into your hands, you can contaminate your hands and if you shake hands with another person, you can transfer the virus to them. Therefore even in respiratory infections, hands hygiene is important. It?s better to use a tissue and discard it immediately. We also recommend you to use your upper arm when coughing and sneezing so that transmission is less as contact with the hand is less.? ?
?There are other infections like gastrointestinal infections including diarrhoea. For example, if you have loose motion and go to the toilet and don?t clean your hands properly, the organisms can remain in your hand. These intestinal infections can be transmitted to another person if you don?t wash your hands and you can even contaminate your food,? she added. ?
?
Speaking of hand hygiene at home she said, ?At home, infections or infective agents like bacteria can be transmitted from things like food. Especially through raw food such as meat and greens. From how we clean and cook our food in Sri Lanka, we can kill the bacteria. But if you don?t wash your hands properly after you prepare the food and if you eat with the contaminated hand, you can get the infection. So it is important to clean and wash your hands after preparation and after touching raw food.? ?
Dr. Jayatilleke further said the methods used to maintain proper hand hygiene too was important. ?There are two ways of maintaining this. One is washing your hands with soap and water. It is better to use liquid soap over cake soap. When using a cake of soap, there?s a higher chance for contamination. You need to keep it in a proper soap tray where the water will be drained, otherwise the water will be a culture medium for bacteria. It?s important to keep the soap dry. When using liquid soap, there?s a lower chance of contaminating the bottle. You also need to dry your hands properly. If you have a towel, the chances of contamination are higher if it is not washed properly. So it is better to use a single-use tissue or a clean, dry towel. Secondly, you can use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer which is equally as good as washing your hands with soap and water. It is user-friendly and accessible. It is also important to use it in supermarkets because when buying raw meats and vegetables, you can contaminate your hands with the micro-organisms on the surface.? ?
?In order to prevent the spread of infection and antibiotic-resistant bacteria, it is important to maintain good hand hygiene,? she concluded. ?

The deputy concerned having realized that it is no easy job to answer frequent allegations being made against this statutory body has arranged a class in his office to coach those attending the media discussions how to field questions raised on allegations made against the statutory body and on issues related to it. The other day the deputy himself had attended this class and had told those who conducted the class, now that he was quite thorough with the subject, he could answer any question pertaining to it. He had added: ?However, I wonder whether I would be able to give any satisfactory answer if they asked me any question about the well -known escapades of these chaps!?
Two days after making that statement, the authority in charge of the subject lost his portfolio!

Macron hits out at Russian media, Putin denies hacking
	
?
REUTERS, 30th MAY, 2017 ?
French President Emmanuel Macron rolled out the red carpet for Russia?s Vladimir Putin on Monday, but past suspicions of Russian meddling in the French election resurfaced with Macron denouncing Russian media and Putin denying hacking allegations. ?
The newly elected Macron hosted Putin at the sumptuous 17th century palace of Versailles outside Paris for his first meeting with the Kremlin leader which he had earlier said would be marked by some straight talking. ?
The 39-year-old French leader and Putin exchanged a cordial, businesslike handshake and smiles when the latter stepped from his limousine, with Macron appearing to say ?welcome? to him in French. ?
When they emerged from talks, which went on for almost an hour longer than scheduled, Macron said they had had a ?frank exchange? and both men stressed they had agreed on the need to move forward on divisive issues such as Syria and Ukraine. ?
But at a joint news conference after their talks, ill-feeling came to the surface over past allegations made by Macron?s camp that state-funded Russian news outlets had sought to destabilise his campaign. ?

Merkel rams home frustration  with Trump after summit
	
?
German Chancellor Angela Merkel underlined her doubts about the reliability of the United States as an ally on Monday but said she was a ?convinced trans-Atlanticist?, fine-tuning her message after surprising Washington with her frankness a day earlier. ?
In a speech in Berlin, Merkel showed how seriously she is concerned about Washington?s dependability under President Donald Trump by repeating the message she delivered a day earlier that the days when Europe could completely count on others were ?over to a certain extent?. ? She made those comments, which sent shock waves through Washington, after Trump criticized major NATO allies over their military spending and refused to endorse a global climate change accord at back-to-back summits last week. ?
?Recent days have shown me that the times when we could rely completely on others are over to a certain extent,? Merkel said. ?
While she made clear Berlin and Washington would ?of course? remain close partners, Merkel stuck to her language from Sunday. ?
?We also know that we Europeans must really take our fate into our own hands,? she added, underlining Europe?s frustration with Trump on climate policy in particular. ?
The American tycoon-turned-president backed a pledge to fight protectionism at the end of a summit of the G7 group of wealthy nations on Saturday. But he refused to endorse the climate pact, saying he needed more time to decide. ?
Merkel added that ties with the United States were of ?paramount importance?, but she otherwise stuck to the thrust of her Sunday message, when she spoke in a packed Munich beer tent.?

MYTH: Sitting too close to the TV will damage your vision. ?
BUSTED: ??No. Actually there is a misunderstanding with regard to this. The problem is, when children go too near the TV, parents either switch it off or make them sit away from it. Parents should realize that the child sits close to the TV because they can?t see from a distance due to a visual problem. Pushing them back won?t help. If they have normal eyesight and sit near the TV they can get dry eyes, because they keep looking at the light. Otherwise, it?s very difficult for someone to sit too close as its difficult to tolerate the bright light,? explained Dr. M.

## Title: Neck Pain
## Section: Medicine

Neck Pain
	
?
There are seven pieces of bone called cervical vertebrae in the inner core of the neck. They bear the weight of the head and protect the spinal cord that travels within?
Neck pain is so common that two out of three people will experience it at least once in their life. The commonest reason for neck pain is remaining in a certain posture for too long, which sprains the muscles. How you sleep, levels of stress, sudden violent movements (whiplash injury) and spondylosis (worn out neck joints) are some other causes for neck ache.?
?
The structure of our neck?
The human neck is a unique structure which can spin more than 180 degrees and bend and tilt in almost any direction. All this mobility comes with an extra price. Imagine a coconut weighing 4kg being balanced on a thin bamboo. This is quite similar to what our neck muscles have to undergo on a daily basis. The muscles balance the heavy skull while also facilitating movements. We should also understand that these muscles are designed to withhold such weights. ? There are seven pieces of bone called cervical vertebrae in the inner core of the neck. They bear the weight of the head and protect the spinal cord that travels within. In between these bones are nerve roots which spring out and supply various regions of the head and neck. Some nerves travel all the way from the neck to the arms and fingers. This is why problems in the neck region are sometimes felt over the shoulders or the arms. ?
Two vital blood vessels called vertebral arteries travel through the neck bones. These blood vessels supply the brain. Therefore, certain conditions or movements of the neck can affect the brain, by alterations in the blood supply.
?
?
How do you feel neck problems?
Pain is the commonest symptom. Pain is felt over the muscles of the neck most of the time. Thus patients complain of aches on the sides or back of the neck. There is no particular time for the onset of pain. It could be after waking up, as most patients? experience. ??
Sometimes stiffness is the dominant symptom. You might feel as if your neck does not move as it used to. There is also difficulty in moving the head, where you have to exert some extra force, especially when performing spinning movements. ?
Numbness is another complaint. The area over and behind the ears might go numb. A tingling sensation might be felt over the shoulders or arms. A clicking / grating sensation called crepitus may be felt with neck movements. This is caused when the joints in the neck rub against each other. This is not always a harmful thing although felt or heard loudly. ?
Sometimes patients may feel dizzy when they turn their head awkwardly. Common examples are when trying to glance behind while reversing the car and tilting the head up for shaving. This happens when the vertebral arteries inside the neck bones get squeezed unnecessarily. Dizziness with head movements does not always mean problems with blood vessels. It could also be a result of ear problems. ?Neck pains can lead to severe muscle spasms, where the muscles surrounding the neck prevent it from moving and are painful to touch. ?
?
?
How can I receive treatment?
If your pain lasts for more than a few days with numbness, visit a doctor. He will collect information on the neck pain. This includes the duration, severity and stiffness. He will then carry out a detailed examination of your neck, which includes checking the ?range of motion?. He will also check for tender areas (which trigger pain) over the muscles and spine. Sometimes, the examination might include shoulder movements as well. ? The Joint Specialist might order X rays or even a specialized scan of your neck depending on the circumstances. X rays are good at detecting bone changes. MRI scans are better at detecting muscles, ligaments, discs and nerves. ? There are a variety of ways to treat neck pain. Analgesics (painkillers) are just one of many options available. Muscle relaxants at night help ease tension-related pain. Neuropathic medication which alter how the nerves sense are helpful in treating numbness and tingling. You might also be instructed to do specific exercises by the doctor. ?
The specialist might advice you to receive physiotherapy. Static and dynamic neck muscle strengthening, heat therapy and sound wave technology are some of the ways in which physiotherapy helps. ??
There is very little known about the advantages of neck collars, so I advise you against using one just because you were asked to. Being aware of and altering the way you sit, stand, carry a heavy bag with a strap or lift objects is useful in preventing further episodes of pain. ?
Transcutaneous electric nerve stimulation, also called TENS therapy, is where the nerves of the neck are stimulated to ease pain. Muscle relaxation therapy also helps. If you feel that stress is causing muscle tension, meditation and listening to soothing music might be useful. The new concept of joint protection strategies are taught to all our patients, as prevention is always better than cure.?
?
What are the common causes of neck pain?
The accepted cause of neck pain is a simple sprain of neck muscles. This does not last for more than a few days and gets better with simple painkillers (analgesics). Wrong positioning of the neck during sleeping, ?pillows that are too thick or too thin, maintaining the same posture for hours, carrying items on top of your head or shoulders and sports injuries are the causes of muscle sprain.

NHSL, GMOA warn on waterborne diarrhoeal disease
	
National Hospital of Sri Lanka (NHSL) and the Government Medical Officers? Association (GMOA) today warned the residents affected by the floods to be aware of waterborne diarrhoeal disease and other communicable diseases.
NHSL Director Dr. Anil Jasinghe said that the people affected by the floods and those engaged in rescue missions should take measures to prevent ?Leptospirosis? bacterial disease. He said skin diseases and respiratory issues and fevers could be common among the affected and therefore proper hygiene should be maintained as a preventive measure.
Meanwhile, the GMOA also warned of several diseases and fears of a dengue epidemic situation within the next two weeks in the flood affected areas.
GMOA Assistant Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said those affected by the flood should be cautious of communicable diseases as fungal infections and diarrheal diseases could easily spread. Dr. Aluthge said to prevent Leptospirosis disease people can use ?Doxycycline? antibiotic two tablets once a week and it is available with the MOH offices and PHIs.
Further he said as the Dengue larvae were flushed away due to the heavy showers and flood situation but there was a risk of it rising to epidemic levels soon after the water receded. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

The barriers to obtaining
	
?
By thusitha malalasekara
Vitamin D is considered an important vitamin which helps in the growth of teeth and bones. It is difficult to obtain vitamin D from food due to the fact that those rich in the vitamin are limited. Therefore, according to nutritionists, various types of food, from dairy products to pre-processed foods and beverages have been enriched with the addition of vitamin D. It is mentioned on the packets of these foods that they contain vitamin D. ??
However, there is a simple way of obtaining vitamin D for those living in tropical countries, where there is abundant sunlight. This is through UV rays which are known to be radioactive and which cannot be seen with the naked eye. These radioactive rays produce the necessary vitamin in the body after absorbing them through the skin, through a complex process connected to the liver and kidneys of the body. However, a sufficient quantity of vitamin D may not be found in certain people because there are other factors which control the production of vitamin D. ??
Colour of the skin: ??
The colour of one?s skin depends on the melanin content. Dark skin is the result of excessive melanin content. Fair-complexioned people do not have a high melanin content. According to research, a large quantity of ultra-violet rays are necessary for those with very dark skin to produce vitamin D. Therefore, those with dark skin should go out in the sunlight more than those who are fair-skinned.
Warmth of the skin: ??
Warm skin produces more vitamin D than cool skin. Therefore, the quantity of vitamin D produced during the warm season is more than that of a cold day. ??
The person?s age: ??
People who suffer from vitamin D deficiency are mainly older adults because their aged skin is incapable of producing the relevant absorption efficiently in the sunlight. ??
Air pollution: ??
Carbon particles released from vehicles, through the burning of garbage and through gas emitted from factories are able to absorb and scatter ultra-violet radioactive rays. Therefore, the skin may not receive a sufficient quantity of rays for the production of vitamin D. ??
The person?s body weight: ??
Certain research points out that the vitamin D content in obese persons is less. It can be concluded that vitamin D content is less due to obesity. ??
Skin ointments: ??
Many people, especially youngsters, go out in the sunlight only after applying various creams such as sunscreen. As a result of this, the production of ultra-violet rays falling on the skin will decrease. ?
?
Liver and kidney health: ??
When the liver is healthy, the liquid that is produced by the liver obstructs the absorption of vitamin D as the production of bile is less. Some liver diseases obstruct the vitamin D conversion. Meanwhile, when the kidneys become sick, the body is unable to get the required content of vitamin D. This is why vitamin D is given to the patients who suffer from kidney failure.

The latest skin care magic: Honey bee venom
	
?
The world is moving faster than we ever thought it ?would a few decades back. Similar to everything else, methods of ?enhancing beauty, therapeutic procedures and medications are rapidly ?advancing, probably due to the higher customer demands and competition ?in the market. ??
Beauty-conscious people who can afford it nowadays use ?vampire face-lifts, facial creams made from placentas and many other ?cosmetic products made from platinum to gold to clay to human urine, not ?gross at all! ??
Do you know about the latest product introduced to the ?market already full of beauty enhancers? It is none other ?than bee venom! ??
What is all this buzz about bee venom?
Honey is a substance extracted from bees which has been ?used by our ancestors for hundreds of years due to its proven benefits ?and antimicrobial and antibacterial effects. This valuable gift from ?nature, also a powerful moisturizer, can be used to clean, hydrate and ?heal damaged skin.
Healthcare professionals as well as Ayurveda experts ?tend to suggest products containing honey or direct application of honey ?with turmeric powder for the treatment of acne. ??
So, moving on to bee venom, the latest advancement in the ?cosmetic field. This has some additional features along with what is ?already possessed by honey. While some of it is easy to apply, most of ?it can be a sluggish and murkier in contrast to its soft and sweet ?counterpart. ??
?
Moving back to the golden days
During ancient times, this substance was extracted through a ?very different procedure and according to American Apitherapy Society, ?bee-venom therapy has been widely practised in the field of medicine in ?ancient Egypt, Greece, India and China. Furthermore, latest research ?results have proven an increased incidence in the recovery of patients ?with rheumatoid arthritis, enlarged prostates and some cancers, ?following this bee venom therapy. ??
Bee venom, when included in the chemical composition of a ?certain cream, lotion, mask or lip serum, will more or less irritate ?your skin as a sting or an insect bite will. Yes it is quite similar, ?resulting in a local inflammatory reaction, with a plumping and burning ?sensation which will have an effect on diminishing signs of aging- ?leading to an outcome similar to an anti-aging chemical. ??
As you get older, the skin will gradually age, losing its ?naturally occurring ?collagen?, giving rise to various cosmetic issues ?like sagging skin, fine lines and wrinkles. ??
Bee venom, the skin magic, consists of a ?potent ?combination of enzymes, peptides and amino acids? says Ayona De Mel, ?Consultant Dermatologist, South Wales, MD. It is further enhanced by ?being combined with popular brands, giving rise to an effect similar to ?that of ?natural botox? which gets absorbed into the skin without any ?invasive procedures or the involvement of needles.
According to Natalie ?Zinder, a product experimenter who works for Venofye, one of the most ?popular brands which is known to be capitalizing on the powers of bee ?venom, the components of this substance are able to fool the skin by ?giving a false alarm on intoxication by stings, which make the body ?react by increasing blood circulation, perfusion of the skin and ?production of collagen- strengthening the body, eventually causing the ?skin to become rejuvenated-fresh, younger and more alive! It is also ?known to act effectively in reducing negative menopausal effects such as ?wrinkling, puffiness, dryness and skin-tag formation, while acting on ?relaxing body muscles to a greater extent. ??Case studies
In a trial done by a set of scientists in Perth involving ?14 women between the ages of 50 and 59, the participants claimed that ?honey bee venom had improved the texture of their skin, decreased lines, ?wrinkles and dryness, making them look almost 10-15 years younger. ??
In contrast, some scientists hold that bee venom should not ?be used on skin, since it could lead to life threatening allergic ?conditions, not just resulting in swelling or itching but even leading ?to Anaphylactic shock. Allergies too can occur, even after being exposed ?to cow?s milk and vaccinations. If you are exposed to the venom of a ?potentially serious or toxic bee, this can lead to a very serious ?situation. So it is all about taking a risk for beauty or else choosing ?to safeguard one?s health. ??
A few years back, Kate Middleton and Gwyneth Paltrow made ?news, when they revealed their secrets of beauty and anti-aging thanks ?to this miracle substance of nature. Since then, many products ?containing bee venom have flooded the market, with numerous additive ?effects. ??
Is it cost-effective?
Bee venom is not a cheap agent for sure, even though it is ?becoming as popular as eau de cologne. Its costs can range from several ?hundreds of dollars to hundred thousands, depending on the brand. If you ?are more up to date on the latest information available, it will ?definitely help you find a cost-effective product with a considerable ?range of beneficial effects. ??
There are some brands containing bee venom which are ?extremely expensive, as there are procedures involved in extracting ?venom in a cruelty-free manner and an eco-friendly process definitely ?requires multiple, high-quality resources and advanced technology. ??
In supporting that fact, The Wall Street Journal 2012 ?mentions that 1g of venom from New Zealand- a country rich in products containing bee venom-with an equivalent of 10,000 ?bee stings, will approximately cost about $304. ?
Are there any alternatives??
However, if you are looking for something with effects similar to plumping and revitalization of skin, the best alternative ?would be salicylic or glycolic acids which have a ?minimum or no-health risk with a comparatively cheaper price tag. Also, ?the mild burning sensations they cause will only result in a ?small swelling, yet are known to give a safe plumping effect. ??
Does it harm?bees-will they die?
Extracting venom from bees is neither harmful nor stressful ?to bees. The whole procedure is done in an eco-friendly manner, where a ?glass sheet is placed in the beehive with a mild electrical current ?generated through it. As soon as the bees sit on the glass, this current will make them stick their stingers and pump out a small amount of venom. Furthermore, when this venom is released, bees will ?secrete a pheromone which will attract other bees to the glass sheet who will act in the same manner. Once a considerable amount of venom is ?collected, it will be purified in special machines and the bees will ?be released back to their natural habitat. ??
Considering these points, why not give a chance to ?these popular beauty products made from bee?s venom, a rapidly growing skincare trend which is already causing a bit of ?buzz globally? ??

TRC seizes wireless phones causing interruptions to mobile 3G network
	
The Telecommunications Regulatory Commission seized 50 DECT6 wireless phones which caused harmful interferences to the 3G network used by the Sri Lankan mobile phones users.
These phones banned in Sri Lanka were brought to the country by individuals who had evaded the customs. The DECT6 phones have a frequency between (1880-1930) MHz. The frequencies given to mobile phone operators in Sri Lanka are between (1915-1980) and (2105-2170) MHz therefore DECT 6 phones causes significant interruptions to the 3G mobile network in Sri Lanka.
DECT (Digital Enhanced Cordless Telecommunications) is a digital wireless telephone technology, which has contributed to making cordless phones common in both businesses and homes.
A large number of consumers have adopted this technology due to its ease, voice quality and wide coverage area and lesser cost. Consumers only pay the cheap cost of fixed line calls, while enjoying mobility and portability of an expensive?mobile?phone.
However, not all cordless phones are being banned ? only DECT 6.0 in order to ensure the smooth functioning of the mobile 3G network.
Speaking at a media briefing, TRC Deputy Director J.A.S. Gunananda said that at the airport sometimes the customs will not be able to detect small electronic equipment or phones such as DECT 6.
?So far we have managed to seize about 100 such phones and we plan to increase the number of raids in the coming weeks and months,? he said.
?Our message to the public is to be aware of the frequencies of these phones before you purchase them. We know that these illegal phones are in the market but we cannot detect unless they switch it on and use it. Then we have the necessary equipment to track down the location and seize the phones,? he noted.
He said that wireless phones which have the required frequency given by TRC can be purchased in Sri Lanka.
TRC also warned all the illegal importers, distributors, sellers and users of DECT 6.0 cordless phones, to refrain from such illegal activity where legal action would be taken against them under the Sri Lanka Telecommunication Act No.25 of 1991.
The seized phones were handed over to the Ceylon Waste Management Company for recycling. (Supun Dias)

Chastened for wanting a forbidden fruit
	
?
There is a certain state purohita hailing from the Puttalam district who had been complaining for the last several months he had become a virtual nonentity in his Ministry as he had no powers or functions assigned for him to do any productive work.?
?
When a day for the reshuffle of the top team was officially announced, he made an appeal to Number One that his portfolio be swapped for another one which, he said, would enable him to do some good work for the country.?
Number One had then perfunctorily asked him what was the subject he was interested in. Our politico had replied that he welcomed the subject now being handled by the media spokesman hailing from Badulla. ?This reply had angered Number One and told the politico from Puttalam: ?The person handling that subject is from the Blue party and you are from the Green party? These subjects have been apportioned on the basis of an agreement reached by the two parties. Now make it a point to look up the agreement that the two parties have signed. ?Don?t come to me with requests like this hereafter!?
Thus chastened, politico had quietly left the place empty handed. ? ??

Cheers for disciple and jeers for Guru
	
?
A commemorative ceremony was held recently in the native place of the slain Tiger leader. The chief purohita for the North and the official leader of the opposition were among the distinguished guests invited to the ceremony.?
?
The opposition leader who got wrinkles and grey hair during the long challenging years in politics was the first to address the gathering.?
The gray-haired leader had hardly begun his address when a section of the audience started hurling questions at him. Meanwhile, another section began booing and raising a big racket. However, the opposition leader had continued speaking amid the din, they say. The opposition leader?s address over, it was announced that chief purohita Wig would address them presently.
Then the sections who raised boos and raised a din earlier greeted the announcement with several rounds of cheers and soon after Wig was seen being carried shoulder-high by enthusiastic young supporters to the podium. Some youths were also seen kissing the feet of the chief purohita being carried to the podium.?
The ceremony over, a Diyawanna member from the North had confided in the elderly politician as to who had organized the hostile reception to him at this ceremony.?
The upshot of this revelation is that it is a dead certainty now that Wig would not get the main North-east party?s nomination to contest the provincial poll round the corner, they say.

Colombia and FARC rebels extend weapon hand-in deadline
	
REUTERS, 30th MAY, 2017- Colombia and the Marxist FARC rebel group have agreed to extend a weapon hand-in deadline for guerrilla fighters by 20 days, President Juan Manuel Santos said on Monday, after logistical delays slowed parts of the group?s demobilization process.
The Andean country and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) rebels signed a peace deal late last year to put an end to more than 52 years of war. The conflict, which also includes a smaller rebel group and paramilitary gangs, has killed more than 220,000 people. Under the accord, rejected in a public referendum but pushed through by congress, all rebels are required to live in special camps around the country and hand in all their weapons to the United Nations, which is overseeing the demobilization process.
Rebel commanders, however, complained that the 180-day hand-in period, which expires May 30, would not be sufficient because of camp construction delays, including setting up sanitation and housing.
?In a joint agreement with the United Nations and the FARC we have agreed that the arms hand-over will not end tomorrow as had been planned, but instead within 20 days,? Santos said in a televised speech.
?The change in date does not in any way affect the firm decision and clear commitment of the government and the FARC to comply with the accord,? he said, adding the rebels? stay in the demobilization camps would also be extended until August 1.
