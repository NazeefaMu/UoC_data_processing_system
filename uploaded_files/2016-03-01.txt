Alleged fraud of Rs. 16M. through illegal appointments
	
Financial fraud amounting to Rs.16 million had been committed by making illegal appointments to the government sector, including to the state school sector, said the secretary of the Ceylon Teachers' Services Union, Mahinda Jayasinghe today.
After lodging a complaint with the Anti-Corruption Secretariat against Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam regarding illegal appointments to the government sector, he said the minister had made such appointments to National schools in Kurunegala, Kuliyapitiya and Karandeniya.
?The proper procedure had not been adhered to in making these appointments. The vacancies had not been advertised in the gazette. The ministry had not even conducted proper interviews,? Jayasinghe said.
He said the minister had violated the establishment code by giving back-dated appointment letters.
?The letters of appointment were dated December 30, 2015 to show that the applicants had assumed duties before January 2016. All the appointments had been made in violation of the fundamental rights of the G.C.E. O/L and A/L qualified persons and in favour of those with political connections,? he said.
He said the appointments had been made to various departments and institutions relating to the education sector.
He also said the government had introduced a Contributory Pension Scheme in budget 2016 for those appointed before January 2016. (Chaturanga Pradeep and Indika Sri Aravinda)

Joint Opp. to complain to Police Commission on Rajitha
	
The joint opposition said today it would complain to the Police Commission tomorrow against the then fisheries minister Rajitha Senaratne based on several charges including that of handing over of the Modera Fisheries Harbour to a private company without Cabinet approval.
Matara District MP Kanchana Wijesekera said the harbour located on some 20 acres of land had been rented out for Rs.125,000 monthly to a private company named, 'Sea Gulf UK.?
?This company was registered only in August, 2014 and with the harbour leased out in October on an order of the then Fisheries Minister Rajitha Senaratne. As soon as the company had taken over the operations, it had dismissed the previous employees and had replaced them with employees of a private company,? he told a news conference held at the Dr. N.M. Perera Centre in Borella.
Mr. Wijesekera said now the authorities had realized that the habour had been leased out for a lesser amount and were making arrangements to charge a monthly rental of Rs.450,000 from the company.
?The minister was vociferous about ?corrupt? deals of the Rajapaksa government and used these deals as one of their key slogans at the election campaign. He behaved as if he had nothing to do with any such deal but today it?s clear that he too was involved in corrupt deals,? he said.
Mr. Wijesekera said they had no faith in the Bribery Commission or the Financial Crime Investigation Division (FCID) and that was why they would complain to the Police Commission.
He said the MPs of the joint opposition would soon visit the Modera fisheries harbour to inspect the site once a date was fixed. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

A media statement signed by the Minister's Media Coordinator Rajitha Samarasuriya, said, "The Minister had only exercised the power vested in him under the University Act and had only asked to consider the qualifications of the said individual.?
?The university has the authority to reject the minister?s request at any time if they found the required qualifications insufficient .?
The statement said the minister had never exercised his powers in order to function the universities independently and ?some individuals have forgotten about his powers under the University Act.?
The statement also charged that the Yahapalana government never removed some lecturers, who openly criticized President Maithripala Sirisena during the last Presidential election, but ?they are just trying to gain political mileage by leaking out letters that are sent to the Universities,? the statement added.

Former Federation of University Teachers Association (FUTA) President Dr. Nirmal Ranjith Devasri yesterday said the Minister of Higher Education and Highways, Lakshman Kiriella should resign as he had no right to influence the appointment of a university lecturer.
FUTA has criticized the minister regarding a letter which is said to have been sent by Minister Kiriella to the Dean of the political science faculty of Kelaniya University, requesting the temporary recruitment of a lecturer for the faculty.
Speaking to the Daily Mirror, Dr. Ranjith Devasri alleged the minister had abused his power and violated the practice of good governance.
?He is no longer suitable to serve as the Minister of Higher Education,? he said.
He said even though they had heard of an illegal procedure in the recruitment of non-academic staff at universities, this was the first time they heard of a direct interference of the minister to appoint an individual to the academic staff.
In the letter, the minister allegedly requests that an individual who has been given a temporary appointment in the discipline of Political Science, be given a position, having considered his qualifications.
However, FUTA submitted a letter to the President, concerning the matter. (Piyumi Fonseka)

From any point of view Buddhist monks in recent history have lacked a strong leader, compared to other religions, Bodu Bala Sena (BBS) General Secretary Ven. Galagodaaththe Gnanasara Thera said.
?We have leaders in our two Nikayas. As every other religion has its own leader, Buddha Sasana also needs to have a leader to represent all the Buddhist monks,? Thera said.
?The president we have is a Sri Lankan Buddhist but he is presented as a nominal figure,? he said.
He made these comments after he appeared before the Appeals Court today regarding a case filed against him. The next hearing had been fixed for March 28, the Thera said.
He said that although there have been responsible persons and authorities, Buddhist monks in the country have been silenced.
?This has caused the decline in Sinhala Buddhists,? he also said.
?No one is here to talk about the pressure that is exerted on the Sri Lankan Buddhist people by the Christian extremists. We have now severely been surrounded by the Christian extremist forces.
Therefore authorities should open their eyes to start a struggle to defeat the Christian extremist forces and to save Sri Lankan Buddhists,? the Thera also said. (Chaturanga Pradeep)

Return remaining lands swiftly-US to SL
	
While expressing support to Sri Lanka in fully implementing the commitments as agreed in the Human Rights Council resolution, the US has urged the Sri Lankan government to return remaining lands to rightful owners swiftly.
?The United States expressed support for the Government?s plans for constitutional and legislative reform including public consultations on a new Constitution and the repeal of the Prevention of Terrorism Act to be replaced by appropriate counter-terrorism legislation consistent with international law,? the US said.
?The United States praised the government of Sri Lanka for its return of land to the rightful owners, and urged that remaining land be returned swiftly,? said a joint statement issued by the Sri Lanka and US after the first annual US-Sri Lanka Partnership Dialogue held on February 26, 2016 in Washington, D.C.
The statement also stated that the US supports Sri Lanka as it undertakes security sector reforms in line with Sri Lanka?s post-conflict requirements.
The full statement
Sharing a commitment to democracy, rule of law, and shared prosperity, the United States and Sri Lanka convened the inaugural Partnership Dialogue on February 26, 2016 in Washington, DC. Both nations highlighted the growing bilateral cooperation between Sri Lanka and the United States and reaffirmed that the relationship is based on shared values and common goals of the two countries and their peoples.
The Partnership Dialogue demonstrates the consolidation of cooperation between the United States and Sri Lanka and serves to further strengthen and enhance bilateral relations in the widest sense, through regular and structured engagement. As fellow democracies, our governments agree that we have a shared interest in working together to foster greater stability, security, prosperity, and a rules-based order for the Indo-Pacific region and around the world.
Building on a long legacy of support for the Sri Lankan people since 1956, the United States plans to launch several programs to encourage investment in Sri Lanka's economy, assist the government in its efforts to institutionalize good governance best practices across key ministries, and support the process of reconciliation and development to which the government and people of Sri Lanka are committed. These efforts are to be undertaken with a view to achieving durable peace and socio-economic progress for all. U.S. assistance and cooperation should help forge new partnerships, dialogues, and exchanges, and be based on mutual respect and inclusive consultations.
International and Regional Affairs
The delegations discussed Sri Lanka?s pivotal geo-strategic location within the Indian Ocean Region and how to strengthen cooperation on issues of regional importance bilaterally and through multilateral organizations like the Indian Ocean Rim Association. The United States encouraged Sri Lankan participation in its Indo-Pacific Economic Corridor initiative to increase economic connectivity among South Asian countries and with Southeast Asia, which is congruent with Sri Lanka?s participation in BIMSTEC and other forums. Both governments affirmed a shared desire to continue to collaborate on issues before the United Nations, including peacekeeping operations. Foreign Minister Samaraweera looks forward to participating in the 2016 Our Ocean Conference in Washington, D.C., hosted by Secretary Kerry, which is to focus on robust commitments to protect our oceans under the four focus areas of marine protected areas, sustainable fisheries, marine pollution, and climate-related impacts on the ocean.
Economic Cooperation
Economic discussions highlighted Sri Lanka?s economic priorities and joint cooperation to expand trade flows, increase foreign direct investment, and improve the overall business environment in Sri Lanka, such as fair and transparent competition practices. Sri Lanka?s delegation appreciated the lifting of the U.S. legislative mandate against supporting Sri Lankan projects at international financial institutions and the U.S. vote in favor of a recent project at the Asian Development Bank, which will deliver $100 million to Small and Medium Enterprises in Sri Lanka. The next Trade and Investment Framework Agreement (TIFA) Council meeting to be held this year should initiate deepened engagement through development of the U.S. ?Sri Lanka Joint Action Plan to increase external trade and investment. This Action Plan, a road map for future work under TIFA, reinforces Sri Lanka?s development strategies and fosters an increased role for foreign direct investment and external trade in Sri Lanka. It also seeks to improve the competitiveness of key industries; promote new industries through innovation; and fully leverage Sri Lanka?s location and skilled workforce. The two sides intend to explore during the TIFA meeting opportunities for exchanging customs information to facilitate the free flow of goods.
USAID's on-going economic programs support growth and promote stability within small and medium scale private companies. Similar initiatives help bring economic stability to vulnerable populations, including war widows, female heads of households, persons with disabilities, and resettled families by providing financial assistance, equipment, tools, training, and market access. In the future, technical assistance to the Ministry of Finance and Board of Investment is planned. The U.S. Departments of Commerce and Treasury and USAID are helping the Sri Lankan Government to improve the commercial law environment and attract foreign direct investment, implementing training programs for key economic sectors, and providing technical assistance for public financial management.
Both sides recognize their shared interest in clean energy development and energy security and reiterated their commitment to deepen cooperation to develop and access affordable, clean renewable energy sources. The United States also agreed to explore ways to support and assist Sri Lanka in the implementation of Sri Lanka?s Climate Action Plan, including adaptation projects. Officials from the Millennium Challenge Corporation said they would visit Sri Lanka in March to begin discussions on Sri Lanka?s threshold program. The Export-Import Bank of the United States looks forward to enhanced engagement with Sri Lanka and its private sector, particularly in the area of infrastructure investment.
Governance, Development Cooperation, and People-to-People ties
The delegation of Sri Lanka emphasized the commitment of the government to strengthening democracy and democratic practices, good governance, the rule of law, justice, reconciliation, and parliamentary procedures. The United States welcomed the significant progress made in many areas during the past year, especially the passage of the 19th Amendment to the Constitution which enabled the setting up of independent commissions, and Sri Lanka?s co-sponsorship of a consensus resolution at the United Nations Human Rights Council in September 2015, which demonstrated Sri Lanka?s strength as a nation committed to achieving lasting peace and prosperity inclusive of truth-seeking, justice, reparations and guarantees of non-recurrence that includes providing closure to the families of the missing, and implementing appropriate reforms to enhance the professionalism of security institutions. The United States expressed support to Sri Lanka in fully implementing the commitments as agreed in the Human Rights Council resolution.
The United States expressed support for the Government?s plans for constitutional and legislative reform including public consultations on a new Constitution and the repeal of the Prevention of Terrorism Act to be replaced by appropriate counter-terrorism legislation consistent with international law. The United States praised the government of Sri Lanka for its return of land to the rightful owners, and urged that remaining land be returned swiftly.
The U.S. Government continues to be proactive in responding to the government?s reform agenda in strengthening democratic and economic governance, rule of law, truth and reconciliation. In October 2015, the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) launched the Sri Lanka Parliament Support Program to build capacity for the newly elected Members of Parliament and their professional staff to fully carry out their policymaking and oversight functions. Similarly, USAID is helping to strengthen public sector accountability and transparency through support to key independent commissions enshrined in the 19th Amendment. The United States and Sri Lanka plan to work together to strengthen the Sri Lankan justice system?s capacity to address criminal activities, including complex crimes such as corruption at all levels, and to deliver fair and equitable justice services to citizens.
With a view to assisting the Government of Sri Lanka in strengthening good governance and the rule of law, the United States agreed to consider Sri Lanka?s requests for assistance through programs and projects aimed at strengthening accountable and responsive governance institutions and capacity building; training and assistance for enhancing accountability, transparency, integrity, and effectiveness of public administration; and inclusive and effective service delivery including local governance. The two countries reiterated their commitment to active and high-level participation in the Open Government Partnership as a strong vehicle for reform, and to pursue robust partnerships with civil society under the Open Government Partnership; and the United States reaffirmed its commitment to supporting Sri Lanka?s work with civil society in the development of its first National Action Plan.
The two nations plan to foster stronger cooperation on women?s empowerment and the advancement of gender equality including by supporting efforts to exchange lessons learned and best practices to enable women?s economic participation, the prevention of and response to gender-based violence, and greater women?s participation in reconciliation efforts.
The two nations reiterated their commitment to the Fulbright Program for student and scholar exchange. They also identified education as an important area for future cooperation and underlined the importance of developing further partnerships between U.S. and Sri Lankan educational institutions.
Recognizing that Sri Lanka faces a number of development challenges ? from the scourge of chronic kidney disease to food insecurity in rural areas ? the U.S. Government expressed its commitment to partner with Sri Lanka to address these issues. The two governments also plan to support multi-cultural, multi-religious, multi-lingual people-to-people dialogue throughout Sri Lanka.
Security Cooperation
Both nations plan to strengthen maritime security cooperation efforts in the Indian Ocean Region in order to counter piracy, provide humanitarian assistance and disaster relief, and ensure free and safe navigation in the region?s vital shipping lanes. The United States welcomed the commitment by Sri Lanka to further contribute towards UN Peacekeeping Operations. The United States also plans to continue to support Sri Lanka?s efforts to remove anti-personnel landmines in former conflict areas. The United States supports Sri Lanka as it undertakes security sector reforms in line with Sri Lanka?s post-conflict requirements.
The delegations aim to expand export control cooperation through the Export Control and Related Border Security program in support of nonproliferation objectives. Both nations recognized the need for greater counterterrorism and intelligence cooperation and information sharing as well as capacity building in view of increasing transnational threats. Both countries also expressed commitment to continue to cooperate to counter money laundering, terrorist financing, and violent extremism. Recognizing the importance of international cooperation to promote an open and secure cyberspace, and Sri Lanka?s standing as the only South Asian nation party to the Budapest Convention, the two sides agreed to explore opportunities for collaboration on cybersecurity and to combat cybercrime.
The Road Ahead
Together, the United States and Sri Lanka recognized the importance of their bilateral relationship and expressed commitment to broadening and strengthening the bilateral partnership. Both delegations expressed satisfaction at the successful completion of the inaugural Partnership Dialogue and agreed to hold the second Partnership Dialogue in Colombo in 2017.

Singapore to help SL in restructuring its foreign ministry
	
Singapore will provide help to Sri Lanka as its government undergoes restructuring, said Singapore's Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) on Monday (Feb 29).
In response to a media query, an MFA spokesperson said Singapore will offer capacity-building assistance for the restructuring of Sri Lanka?s foreign affairs ministry. ?MFA hosted a two-day study visit in January 2016 for senior officials from the Sri Lankan Ministry of Foreign Affairs, covering areas such as planning, human resource and training,? said the spokesperson.
However, the restructuring exercise and decisions taken will be entirely led by Sri Lanka?s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the spokesperson added.
Singapore?s Minister for Foreign Affairs Vivian Balakrishnan had agreed to Sri Lanka?s request for help in its restructuring plans during his counterpart Mangala Samaraweera?s introductory visit to the Republic last year, said MFA.
?Singapore is prepared to offer further capacity-building assistance in relevant areas upon the Sri Lankan government?s request,? the spokesperson added. (channelnewsasia)

Stopping Port City Project has affected credit rating: Gammanpila
	
The Government move to halt the Port City Project funded by the Chinese Government which is considered the fastest growing economy in Asia has resulted in downgrading Sri Lanka's sovereign credit rating to ?B+? from ?BB-? by Fitch Ratings, opposition MP Udaya Gammanpila claimed today.
He said neither the US nor Britain had ignored projects initiated under Chinese President Xi Jinping because they have realized the significance of maintaining cordial ties with China.
Mr. Gammanpila said even though President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe visited many powerful countries like Germany and Britain, they were unable to obtain financial support to uplift the country?s economy.
He said the only option the government had was the renewing of ties with the Chinese Government and seeking its support to strengthen the economy.
?The Premier sent Foreign Affairs Minister Mangala Samaraweera to China last month with the purpose of reaffirming ties between the two countries. The effort seems to have failed and now Mr. Wickremesinghe is sending Development Strategies and International Trade Minister Malik Samarawickrama to China this month. He must have realized that there is no option other than approaching China. The government will have to apologize and re-start the Port City Project soon,? Mr. Gammanpila said.
However, he warned that unless the Chinese government agreed to help Sri Lanka, the country would have to face economic crisis like Greece, Iceland and Spain.
Even though they had disputes with the government, Mr. Gammanpila said they were keen to provide their knowledge to uplift the country's economy.
He urged the government to set up a ?National Economic Council? comprising government and opposition politicians, academics and front-line businessmen to provide imputs on revitalising the economy. (Piyumi Fonseka)

?There clearly is a concerted effort on the part of the UNP to destroy the SLFP completely. When President Maithripala Sirisena took over the position of SLFP chairman, it was expected that he would look after the party rank and file, uphold party policies and protect the identity of the SLFP even though he was elected President on UNP votes. Regrettably, that has not happened,? he said.
