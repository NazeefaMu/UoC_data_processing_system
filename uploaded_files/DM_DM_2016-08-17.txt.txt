A big tip for billing for coffee!
	

The former strongman accompanied by a group of loyal Diyawanna members left for South Korea the other day in response to an invitation.

The day he took the flight, the former strongman as usual retired to the special guests lounge at the airport to wait for the travel documents duly sealed and endorsed.
They were thus cooling their heels in the lounge, when an airport attendant approached the former strongman and asked him: Sir, would you like to have a cup of tea
The former strongman asked for coffee instead and later they all had coffee. Passports and other documents were soon returned and they were about to leave the lounge to board the plane when a lounge attendant came running and extended an oblong paper. They were all surprised to find it was a bill for Rs. 4,500 for having coffee in the special guests lounge.
An aide of the former strongman immediately handed a Rs. 5,000 note to the airport attendant.
The attendant who got wise to the situation, said apologetically: Sir, we now charge for tea and coffee served in this lounge. Ill pay the bill and bring back the balance immediately
One of the group then gave a pat on the back of the attendant and told him: Dont bother to bring back the balance. Hand it to the one who ordered the billing for the coffee served as our tip with our compliments!

A case where ignorance was bliss
	

This fair one is holding a very high office in a commission much talked about these days.

The lady met a group of colleagues from the black-coated community during a recent visit to Aluthkade. A popular figure among pro-yahapalanaya groupings, the lady had occasion to chat to a few pro- JO colleagues as well. While swapping banter with them, the lady told them: I understand that you people have coined a nick name for me now.
We really dont know it. What is it Please tell us! a black-coated one pleaded.
Then the lady uttered a three-letter word and asked them: Is it not the nick name you have coined
However, the colleague ventured no reply though he appeared to be on the brim of laughter.
The lady spoke up again. Tell your friends who gave me the second baptism that I really like the new name they have given!
Having said that, the lady walked away.
Once she was safely out of earshot, the black-coated one burst into laughter. After giving vent to his mirth, he addressed the colleagues looking askance at him. She doesnt know the real nick name we have given her. She has mixed up the letters of the name!
Why beat about the bush Tell us the nick name you have given her!
A colleague insisted.
Apoy! How can I utter a filthy word here, he said and beat a hasty retreat.

Australia returns 6 rejected asylum seekers to SL
	
Six asylum seekers who attempted to reach Australia by boat have been sent back to Sri Lanka in a demonstration that tough border enforcement measures had not softened since recent Australian elections, a Cabinet minister said Wednesday.
A tip from the Sri Lankan government alerted Australian authorities that the boat was on its way, Border Protection Minister Peter Dutton said in a statement. The six were returned to Sri Lanka on Tuesday, he said.
"This return shows that there has not been, and will not be, any change to Australia's robust border protection policies," Dutton said.
The government releases few details about such interceptions at sea, which have prevented any asylum seeker from reaching Australia by boat for two years.
News Corp., citing an anonymous government source, reported the Sri Lankans were all men and had been stranded at sea with a faulty engine for at least two weeks when they were spotted by an Australian surveillance plane in international waters.
The men were assessed as not being genuine refugees and were returned to Sri Lanka by plane, News Corp. reported. It is not clear from where that plane took off.
The government refuses to allow refugees from Asia, the Middle East and Africa who come by boat, usually from Indonesian ports, to settle in Australia. The boats are often turned back or sunk, with their passengers and crews sent to Indonesia in life boats supplied by Australia.
Asylum seekers were an issue in the elections in July. The conservative government had warned that if the opposition Labor Party had won, they would have softened the border protection measures, which have been criticized by Indonesia and human rights groups.
The Sri Lankans are the first known attempt by asylum seekers to reach Australia by boat since the July 2 poll. (ABC)

The rough seas off Bambalapitiya made it difficult for the body found floating to be brought shore and it remained in the sea for more than six hours.
The body, which was later identified as that of Pathum Fernando, a 22-year-old resident of Indigahapitiya in Ja ela, was brought ashore by an unidentified individual and left on a pavement nearby. Kollupitiya Police arrived at the scene after being informed by a resident of the area.
Police said their preliminary investigations revealed that the victim had been employed at a private bank in Colombo 3 and had allegedly visited a customer in Wellawatte that morning.

Delhi bans Chinese kite string
	
A day after two people, including a three year old girl, died after getting entangled in the maanjha (sharp string used for flying kites), the Delhi Government on Monday banned Chinese maanjha in the capital. The move comes after Independence Day, when kite flying is practiced throughout the city. The sharp string is often coated with glass or metal to make it sharper, causing deaths of birds flying in the sky as well.
A 22-year-old man died Monday after his neck got entangled in the kite string, making him take a fatal fall from his motorcycle. The incident happened in west Delhis Mianwali Nagar area.
In another incident, a three-year-old girl Saanchi Goyal died when she was returning home with her parents after watching a movie in Naraina. The girl was looking out of open sunroof in the car when suddenly her neck got slit by a manjha as they were passing through Rani Bagh area, a police officer said.
Animal rights organisation PETA had also last week filed a petition with the National Green Tribunal demanding an immediate ban on use of the string ahead of Independence Day on August 15. The organisation had said that the string can cause serious injuries, sometimes fatal, to birds, animals and also humans.
Manja is a menace to public safety,posing a life-threatening risk to humans and birds alike. PETA India is calling on authorities to make kite-flying enjoyable and safe for everyone by banning manja from the activity, said PETA India Government Affairs Liaison Nikunj Sharma. (Indian Express)

Ex-PS members in Ratnapura tell Basil to form new party
	
Some former SLFP pradeshiya sabha members in the Ratnapura district have urged former minister Basil Rajapaksa to form a new political party under former president Mahinda Rajapaksa's leadership because they had no intention of contesting the local government elections under an SLFP led by President Maithripala Sirisena.
Former PS chairman S. Karawita who is heading the group said this decision when they met on Aug.15.
This group is made up of 127 former members from 17 Pradeshiya Sabha in the Ratnapura District.
He said the new party would follow the Bandaranaike policies.
Mr. Karawita said only few former PS members had attended the interviews to select candidates for the local government election.
Mr. Karawita said the discussion was held under the patronage of Basil Rajapaksa.
Rathnapura District Parliamentarians Pavithradevi Wanniarachchi, T. Ranjith Soysa, Janaka Wakkumbura and Vasudewa Nanayakkara also attended the meeting.

Facebook friendship ends up as a time bomb
	

A head of a certain government department handling public security among several other services to the people had struck up a friendship with the wife of a big name in the jewellery business through the Facebook.

However, this high-up had not revealed his real name or the real designation to the lady befriended. Instead, he had posed as an officer holding a minor position in the department. 
As their Facebook friendship grew up they began having an occasional chat over the phone as well. One day, the lady had asked the Facebook friend whether he could do her a favour at the departmental level.
The high-up told her that he could help, and invited her to meet him at a certain place at a certain time.
The lady who smelled a rat, ignored the proposed tryst and sought to get her matter attended to by other means.
Meanwhile, the Facebook friend kept on pestering her with calls and finding him an endless nuisance, she called at a nearby Police station to make a complaint. However, Policemen on duty had hesitated to record her statement.
Later the lady had told her story to several government authorities and inquiries that ensued had traced the telephone calls the lady had received to their origin!
Meanwhile, some informed sources say that the complaint made by the lady is going to be veritable time bomb which may explode throwing the errant head of the department out of his recently occupied seat!

Govt. to redraft VAT Bill
	
The Government has initiated the redrafting of the Value Added Tax (Amendment) Bill by way of a memorandum submitted to the Cabinet for its consideration, Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake said.
The Bill which was placed on the Order Paper of Parliament was nullified following a ruling by the Supreme Court which said that the due procedure laid down in the Constitution and Standing Orders governing parliamentary businesses had not been followed.
When a Bill is presented in the House, it should be done after securing Cabinet approval and the receipt of such approval has to be communicated to the House in terms of Standing Order 133. The finance minister said another memorandum would be submitted on this matter on Friday for consideration by the Cabinet.
We intend to secure approval next week, he said.
When asked whether it would be taken up in Parliament next week itself, he said it would be done immediately and noted that the new Bill would be drafted with changes to the original document.
In the original Bill, the government had sought to increase VAT from 11 per cent to 15 per cent. It has also been proposed to do away with the exemptions granted to certain service sectors such as telecommunication while widening the VAT liability threshold. (Kelum Bandara)

He has bounced back to win a contract
	

This character is a member of a well-known political family in Gampaha. He had never contested an election to enter the Diyawanna council though his other siblings had done so from different political parties. However, in the recent past he contested an election of a different type and lost.

By the way, this worthy had to cool his heels in the State lodge for a few days thanks to certain doings of his during the previous regime.
Come whatever government into power, our man is so clever he would warm his way into the graces of the powers that be. He has already hooked some powerful persons of yahapalanaya as well, they say.
The other day, he got down several state of the art printing machines at a huge cost. He had purchased these costly printing machines in anticipation of being the awarded of a lucrative printing contract from a State-owned corporate body which brings windfalls to the people for a small investment!
This contract is now being handled by a sister of a former purohita hailing from a distinguished family in Wayamba. A yahapalanaya purohita from Wayamba too had helped this lady to get this contract, they say.
The siblings sudden bouncing back from his brief bad patch is the talk of the town these days.

Joint Opposition MPs Keheliya Rambukwella and C.B. Ratnayake, who were removed from their posts as SLFP organisers, said they did not regret being ousted from their posts.
MP Rambukwella said he was very happy about being removed as the SLFP organiser of the Kundasale Electorate and added that it should have been done earlier.
He said people were not ready to accept the organisers appointed by SLFP Chairman and President Maithripala Sirisena. I see this as a personnel victory as I can now work without any fear as an Opposition MP to protest against the undemocratic actions of the government, he said.
C. B. Ratnayake, who was removed as the organiser of the Walapane Electorate in the Nuwara Eliya District, said he too had no regrets about the decision taken by the SLFP Chairman and President Maithripala Sirisena to oust him.
He said the removal of Joint Opposition members as SLFP organisers would lead to further divisions within the party and that it would have a negative affect on the party in the future.
He said most of the organisers who were removed had strong voter bases and deeply rooted family ties in their respective areas. I have been the organiser of the Nuwara Eliya District since 1992. I have no regrets about being removed. I will continue to work for the people in my district as a MP. Family politics also play a major role in politics as in the case of the Senanayakes, the Bandaranaikes and the Rajapaksas. People still rally round such families, he said. (Ajith Siriwardana)

Future driving licence applicants would have to declare if he/she was willing to donate organs according to scheduled Cabinet Papers, Cabinet Spokesman Rajitha Senaratne said.
This will be indicated in the new digital driving licence.
There is a shortage of organs in hospitals in an emergency because fewer people are willing to donate organs these days. Most of the donors are not healthy. Most of the body donations were late, when they are accepted by hospitals. At that time most parts in the body are already decaying, the minister said.
Because of that it is decided to insert a statement of consent in the application forms, he said.
The organs will only be taken after a qualified doctors approval that the donor had died in an accident and there was no damage to the organs. If the driver had given his consent in the driving licence, then the organs could be used, he said.
The Statement of consent is to be inserted to the newly introduced digital Driving Licence. The Cabinet Paper is to be presented at the next Cabinet meeting. (Chaturanga Pradeep)
