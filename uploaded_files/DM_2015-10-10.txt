The full message
I take great pride and pleasure in issuing this message of greetings in commemoration of the 66th Army Day of the Sri Lanka Army. As we mark yet another milestone in the history of the Army, freedom-loving citizens all over the country rise with us to salute the gallant men and women who stood at the hour of need to protect the territorial integrity of our country.

Today, as we mark the 66th anniversary, being a dignified and professional organization, let me first of all, pay my tribute to all those who have made the supreme sacrifice, suffered injuries and are recovering from injuries. At this momentous occasion, past Commanders of the Army and all the Officers who steered and gave leadership to the Sri Lanka Army, Regimental Sergeant Majors, senior and junior non-commissioned Officers, and all other members deserve our greatest gratitude for making us feel proud of such a great history, spanning for 66 years. Moreover, the commitment and perseverance displayed by our serving members to strengthen and elevate the standards of the Army to greater heights are truly admirable.

At this special juncture, I wish to extend my earnest gratitude to the families of our men and women in uniform. Without their commitment and endurance, the Army would not have been able to operate in the way that it did. I salute them for the unfathomable sacrifices they have made on behalf of our nation.

I take this opportunity to pay special tribute to the visionary leadership of His Excellency the President Maithripala Sirisena and Secretary Defence Eng. Karunasena Hettiarachchi who have fervently stood by our Armed Forces, keeping National Security interests closer to their hearts.

The Sri Lanka Army as the forerunner, over the years, has displayed its professionalism in all situations in the most commendable manner and that the nation has been a proud benefactor of the contributions made by the Army, both during times of war and peace. The victorious journey of the Army, its gallantry and fortitude has impressively inspired confidence amongst all citizens of Sri Lanka.
The boundless contribution of our Army in the effort of nation-building is amongst its greatest legacies. Be it ensuring the Nation's territorial integrity, fighting the scourge of terrorism, or reaching out to fellow citizens in times of natural calamities, our Army has time and again performed their duties with dedication, maturity and professionalism.

Whilst at all times we are ready to defend our Nation for which professional skills have been supplemented with knowledge and wisdom. The Sri Lankan soldiers are admired world over for their display of humanity, discipline, professionalism and integrity. These attributes will without doubt enable us to be more efficient when we embark on increasing our participation in UN Peacekeeping Missions.

Paying due attention to the basic requirements of soldiers, a number of comprehensive welfare projects, aimed at their needs, has already been implemented and it is my wish to further broaden their scope in the future. It is my firm belief that empowerment through education is important as it opens many avenues of opportunity. Therefore, fittingly, education, capacity building, housing and healthcare are given equal priority in the current agenda of the Army.

Our sole aspiration is to safeguard our motherland and its citizens at all times. Let everyone understand their role and responsibility to achieve this noble cause. It requires unity of purpose and the ability to focus on issues to be addressed united with a spirit of reconciliation. I urge all members of the Army to remain steadfastly loyal to the nation and be professionally competent.

I wish to, once again, thank all the Officers, Other Ranks and Civilian Staff for the innumerable contributions they have made in the interest of sustaining peace and security in our motherland. I take this opportunity to wish you all the best in all your future endeavours!

Strict rules to check unruly behaviour in Yala
	
The Wild Life Department (WLD) said yesterday it would strictly enforce the rules and regulations on the behavior of foreign and local visitors, drivers and guides within the Yala National Park.
It said a more efficient monitoring system would be in place with the deployment of more traffic police and other police officers.
WLD Director General H.D. Ratnayake said the new rules and regulations would also help to minimize the potential hazards to the environment and the wild animals in the Yala National Park.
Several incidents were reported recently where wild animals including leopards were killed after being hit by speeding vehicles.
Mr. Ratnayake said the irresponsible behavior of local and foreign visitors and drivers has endangered the lives of wild animals in to danger.
Due to the alarming increase in the hazards faced by wild animals, we have taken measures to inform the public not to disturb the animals during their visits. In a recent incident, a group of nine people under the influence of liquor had disturbed the wild animals. They had tried to beat the animals too. We took legal action against them and now they are in police custody for violating the Wild Life Act. As such, every possible action will be taken against any individual who violates the law, he said.
We have also informed the police to deploy more policemen at the park to increase police patrols so that all the vehicles that enter the Yala Park will be monitored by them, Mr. Ratnayake said.
He said humps would be set up on the roads to slow down speeding vehicles, notice boards and banners would be placed to make the public aware on the importance of upholding the law. (Piyumi Fonseka)
