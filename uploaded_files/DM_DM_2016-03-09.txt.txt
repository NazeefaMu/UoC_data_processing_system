A triangle in a tangle
	

A fair and lovely Diyawanna member in yahapalanaya had found herself in a mortifying situation recently.

She paid a sudden visit to a young fellow member hailing from Ratnapura area. In fact, the duo had been long standing friends.
Comfortably settled close to each other on a settee, they were immersed in a heart to heart chat when lo and behold the fair ones husband suddenly appeared before them unannounced.
The young husband was livid when he found her wife had even put an arm round her friends shoulder. An altercation that ensued was about to escalate into fisticuffs when several security guards who rushed to the scene had pulled the two belligerent ones apart and made a modicum of peace.
However, the irate husband was still swearing at his wife as they walked out of the place together, eye witnesses say.

CB Bond scam caused economic crisis, not MR regime: Yapa
	
The Joint Opposition today slammed Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe for accusing Rajapaksa regime of current economic crisis and charged that the recent tax reforms were a result of the Central Bank Bond sale scam which took place a year ago.
UPFA MP Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena said the Prime Ministers argument was that the actions of Mahinda Rajapaksas Government had caused economic crisis, which he said was a lie.
This is an utter lie. The taxes were had to increase as a result of the Central bank Bond sale. Economists had calculated that the interest rate of Sri Lanka which was 9.5 percent had been increased to 13. 5 percent because of the Bond scam.
Because of this, we have to pay extra Rs. 145 billion in 30 years as interest. This is the year, we have to make the first payment which is an excessive amount of Rs. 5 billion and this is why the taxes were increased. People are paying for the Bond scam today, he told a news conference.
Meanwhile, he said the Central Bank Governor, who is in the centre of the controversy of the alleged Bond sale, had meet the Attorney General in discreet, where there is a court case pending against him.
This is absurd. The Government should also look into the Governors son-in-laws company under the Money Laundering Act, MP Abeywardena said.
Quoting a World Bank report on the economy of the country from 2005 to 2013, the MP said Sri Lanka had taken commendable measures to eradicate poverty and to improve livelihood and basic services for the people. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Conspiracy to remove Sinhalese from North and East: BBS
	
The Bodu Bala Sena (BBS) General Secretary Ven. Galagodaaththe Gnanasara Thera today charged that there was an ongoing conspiracy by the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) and several other personnel to chase out Sinhalese from their native lands in the North and East with the intention of re-merging the two provinces.
The Northern Province and the Eastern Province were merged into one contiguous Northeastern Province with the implementation of the 13th Amendment. Later in was again divided into two provinces.
The initiative was launched from March 4. The Northern Provincial Council and the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) is backing this move to chase Sinhalese people away and preventing the resettlement of them, the Ven. Thera said.
No support was given for the development of the Sinhalese Education Zones in Vavuniya and Weli Oya areas, and no appointments were made to the existing teacher vacancies, he said.
No appointments had also been made to the State sectors in the Northern Province, while taking steps to transfer the existing State workers conspiringly, he charged.
There is an ongoing process of resettling Tamils in lands which were taken from the Sinhalese people forcibly. The TNA had forcibly stopped building houses in Kokilai Sinhala fishing village. Kokilai, Sampath Nuwara and Weli Oya are ancient lands of the Sinhalese, Gnanasara Thera said.
The Ven. Thera was referring to the houses that were being rebuilt by the Government in these areas.
There are about 325 fishing families, who are permanent residents of the Kokilai village without proper houses. The money given to reconstruct 65 houses that were given by late Ranasinghe Premadasa had been used to resettle Tamils in that village, the Thera said.
A 50 acre block of the Kok Eliya land , which was the only Sinhala village in Vavuniya had been bulldozed by a member of TNA (Sinnamon), who had been a leader of the LTTE pistol gang and taken steps to resettle Tamils in that village, he said.
We ask President Maithripala Sirisena why the Government couldnt take any action against the TNA and other Tamil organisations. Do only Sinhalese have to be law abiding citizen of this country he said.
He also queried as to why the police could not take action against Sinnamon, who is out on bail, and had 16 charges against him. (Chaturanga Pradeep and Kalathma Jayawardhane)

Disappointed politico visits the other camp
	

The Big Boss the other day took a firm decision to appoint a number of new electorate level organizers for the Betel leaf party. This led to the ouster of several party heavyweights.

Meanwhile, a local politico from the Galle area was asked to call at the party headquarters to accept his appointment as the organizer of his electorate. And he happily appeared there on the dot. He waited some time for a call from a party bigwig for the formal presentation of the appointment letter, but even his presence did not appear to have been taken notice of. At length, a secretarial one of the party appeared before him and informed him that there was no possibility of presenting the appointment letter to him that day.
This unexpected revelation angered the local politico. Then why on earth did you summon me here today Why do you want to humiliate me like this
The secretarial one addressed the disappointed local politico in an apologetic tone: Malli, we have come across a problem. We cannot successfully pursue those cases without the co-operation of the sitting one. Therefore, we have to allow him to continue in the capacity of the party organizer for a short while. You may remember that he turned against the former Lokka too for denying him nomination. So Malli, please be patient until we sort out this snagWe can consider appointing you as a district organizer for the time being
The soothing words of the secretarial one made no effect on the angry local politico. He left the party office after giving him a piece of his mind.
The disappointed politico was seen later in the day in a happy mood at the former strongmans new political office, they say.

According to department sources, this aspirant now appears set to use whatever unethical means within his reach in a last-ditch attempt.

The entire country recently experienced a blackout like a bolt from the blue. Now an inquiry is underway to ascertain whether it was the work of some saboteurs.

The countrys tallest building, Colombo World Trade Centre too was a casualty of this blackout. An imperious white collar bigwig playing a big role in managing the countrys finances had been among those in the cage when an elevator of this building got stuck midway due to the power failure on
that day. 
As the emergency power generator too failed to activate, this bigwig had to remain imprisoned in the lift cage for a considerable time. The complaint made by the furious white collar one to the authorities concerned later had gone a long way in galvanizing the officials responsible into action soon after, they say.

India to finance three water projects in SL
	
India today signed an agreement with Sri Lanka to provide over $400 million to finance three water supply projects in the country that would benefit at least one million consumers.
The agreement, between the Export-Import Bank of India and Sri Lanka's National Water Supply and Drainage Board, was inked in the presence of the Minister of Water Supply Rauff Hakeem and the Indian High Commissioner in Colombo, YK Sinha.
The buyers credit arrangement is worth $403.1 million, the minister said in a press release.

A yahapalanaya purohita has made plans to lease out the racecourse in Nuwara-Eliya to an investor of a neighbouring country.

Under this arrangement, the Nuwara-Eliya racecourse is to be developed while another racecourse in Katunayake is to be laid out anew under the proposed direct foreign investment project. The purohita has already submitted the project proposal to the highest decision-making body on economic development, they say.
However, the initiative taken by this purohita to promote a racecourse project which has nothing to do with the subject assigned to him has come under fire from several of his colleagues including the one handling sports at the national level. This purohita is already in hot water over his controversial move to award a multi-million house construction project to an investor in a neighbouring country. His colleagues predict that the purohita would run into worse trouble over the latest racecourse project.

Malaysian Indian Congress against hiring Lankans as guards
	
The Malaysian Government should not allow the hiring of former Sri Lankan soldiers as security guards in view of security and human rights concerns, said (Malaysian Indian Congress) MIC Youth chief C. Sivarraajh.
He said any move to hire them must take into consideration the sensitivities of the Tamil community in the country.
Deputy Home Minister Datuk Nur Jazlan Mohamed had been quoted as saying that the Government might lift the ruling of allowing only Nepalis to be hired as security guards.
We may have to look at other source countries that have a good supply of security guards with military background, such as Sri Lanka, he was quoted as saying.
Last Saturday, a crackdown on illegal security guards by the Immigration Department gave residents of guarded communities the jitters.
Sivarraajh, in a statement yesterday, said that it was better if the relevant stakeholders could train Malaysians to become security guards instead.
The lack of professionally-trained security personnel can be overcome by training locals. Former Sri Lankan soldiers are not suitable to be employed as security guards.
Between 2014 and 2015, the Home Ministry cancelled the licences of 40 security guard companies and issued final warning notices to 49 others for various offences, including hiring untrained illegal immigrants as guards.
A total of 347 enforcement operations were conducted between 2013 and March 1 this year, which saw 1,116 illegal security guards and 26 employers detained.(The Star Online)

Sri Lankas leader of Opposition R. Sampanthan on Tuesday slammed the government over continuing detention of people booked under the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA) even after it committed itself at the UN Human Rights Council last year to review and repeal the law.
Speaking on a motion on the subject of missing persons and those in custody, Mr. Sampanathan, who also heads the Tamil National Alliance (TNA), recalled how the previous governments had granted amnesty to those who were arrested during the insurgency of the early 1970s and the late 1980s. He asked the Sirisena-Wickremesinghe government why the Tamil prisoners should be treated differently.
Mr. Sampanthan argued that those who were detained are not charged with crimes against society but charged with crimes which have political dimensions.
Their continued detention was not compatible with transitional justice. He contended that a political decision had to be taken with regard to the prisoners, a matter which could not be viewed merely in legal sense.
The TNA leader also urged the government not to let itself dictated by slogans from certain parochial sections.
He described as absurd and stupid the reported observation of a political leader regarding the re-emergence of [Tamil] Eelam if the government released the prisoners, withdrew military from the Northern Province and allowed the re-merger of the North and East with powers on land and police.

Seylan Bank Director/Chief Executive Officer Kapila Ariyaratne commenting on this initiative said, Seylan Bank has always been in the forefront when it comes to innovation and value addition, both in its products and processes. Believing that digital is the way forward, the bank has taken actions to deliver new ways of banking, making technology meaningful for the consumers. Seylan MPAY is one such initiative taken by the bank to be on par with the global trend of cashless, paperless transactions. Seylan MPAY is an ideal solution developed in the backdrop of understanding the changes of how transactions are done nowadays and especially with a view to help the small and medium enterprise (SME) and micro segments of the economy.
Seylan MPAY is an easy to use device with a user-friendly app which works with any Android or iOS platform on smartphone or tablet device enabling mobile cashless transactions. Paired with a free Bluetooth Card reader, the device will enable the vendors to accept Visa and MasterCard credit and debit card payments. Seylan MPAY is designed using best-in-class security protocols, such as the PCI DSS Guidelines  a global security standard developed by Visa, MasterCard and other major card providers. It is also built within a secure network that is regularly monitored and tested in order to maintain the strictest standards of information security and protection of cardholder data.
Senior Deputy General Manager Retail Banking Tissa Nanayakkara stated, Seylan Bank, sensing the pulse of businesses, entrepreneurs and e-commerce platforms as well as the increasing popularity of cashless transactions, has launched Seylan MPAY, a mobile POS system to benefit the business community and consumer base of the country.
Seylan MPAY, powered by PAYable, has been developed in collaboration with CBA Solutions (Pvt.) Ltd, a spin-off of Ceylon Business Appliance, whose experience and insight over the past 45 years in providing quality products and services have been remarkable. A normal POS machine requires the business to have a start-up fee and specific minimum turnover and fixed fee whereas MPAY does not require either of the above, making it affordable for everyone.
All one has to do is run the app on their smartphone, enter the amount, read the card via the card reader, capture the digital signature of the customer on the vendors smartphone and deliver a digital receipt. The card reader and mobile app are provided completely free of charge. The bank does not charge any start up fees, monthly commitments or deposits from the customers, however, the standard per transaction commission is applicable.
Being attuned to the needs of the emerging small-scale business community, Seylan is continuously in the process of innovating banking services and adding value to its products in every possible angle in keeping with its aspiration to become the most innovative and tech-savvy bank. Seylan Tikiris timely gifts, Seylan Travellers card, Seylans social media promotions and Seylan MPay are few steps taken by Seylan to keep pace with the digital era.

Ven. Uduwe Dhammaloka Thera arrested
	
The Criminal Investigations Department (CID) today arrested the Ven. Uduwe Dhammaloka Thera on charges of illegally keeping a baby elephant in his possession.
The CID arrested the Ven. Thera at the Alan Mathiniyaramaya Temple in Polhengoda this afternoon.
Earlier, the Thera had filed a Fundamental Rights petition in the Supreme Court seeking an Interim Order preventing the Police from arresting him.
Last month, the Attorney General directed the CID to arrest Ven. Uduwe Thera and produced before the Court for keeping the baby elephant at the Temple illegally.
The CID informed Court that they had enough evidence to file a case against the Ven. Thera under the Fauna and Flora Protection Ordinance.
Wildlife Department officers had raided the temple on January 28, 2015 and found a two-and-half-year-old elephant calf and took it into custody.
The Ven. Thera had not been able to produce any documents that gave him permission to keep the elephant calf, according to the CID.
The Thera had been asked to give a statement to the CID on January over the charges. However, the Thera had admitted himself to a private hospital, without reporting to the CID and later they had record his statement at the hospital.
The Ven. Uduwe Thera said at a news conference last month that he only nurtured the elephant calf that was abandoned at his temple.(Darshana Sanjeewa)
