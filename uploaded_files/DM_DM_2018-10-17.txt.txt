A tragi-comic ending of an official conference!
	

Several leading lights in Sinhala cinema called on a top team member at his office the other day to discuss some burning issues relating to the cinema halls across the country.

These veterans in the film industry, who had come armed with files containing facts and figures relevant to the issues they wanted to discuss, began explaining matters while the top team member seated at the head of the table was giving them an attentive ear.
However, suddenly realizing that there was no response coming forth from the political authority they took a closer look to find that the man was fast asleep.
Deciding that there was no purpose in proceeding with the discussion with a person deep in slumber, the cinema stalwarts stood up to leave the place.
Meanwhile, the politico awakened by the sound of chairs scraping against the floor called out: Dont go! Tell me all your problems. Ill solve them!
The cinema stalwarts returned to their seats and resumed making their representations quoting facts and figures dug from their files.
After a few minutes, they found the top team member napping again breathing heavily. Livid with anger, they all got up from their seats as one of them said: Lets go! Thiss not a discussion, but a b. y joke!
The top team member-wide awake again made an apologetic appeal: Dont go! By the way, what were you saying
What is the use of talking if this is the  one of them started venting his spleen, but the politico cut him short: Yes! Yes! You are right! Its much better for you to put down all your problems in writing! Ill solve them all without the least delay!
The cinema stalwarts seething with anger walked out offering no reply, they say.

A wedding guest with a chip on his shoulder!
	

A family wedding of a fair purohita in yahapalanaya took place in a high-end hotel in the city the other day.

Despite the fair purohita being a Green, Diyawanna politicos from other political parties too had been invited to the wedding. Number One in yahapalanaya, the Green Chief and the former strongman were among the prominent guests on the occasion.
Of the VVIP guests, the first to arrive for the wedding was Number One in yahapalanaya.
As soon as Number One took a seat, an elderly green purohita who approached him sat in a chair close to him. There were several others too at this table a few seats away.
It soon appeared to all present that the elderly green one was criticizing someone with Number One, who was giving him an attentive ear.
It had later transpired that the object of his harangue was a holder of a very high office in the government. Slamming this high-up in very strong terms he had reportedly described him as a person who had forgotten his beginnings.
The elderly politico was still holding forth, when the former strongman walked in later and on seeing the latter he beat a hasty retreat to a quiet corner, they say.

Body of missing Saudi journalist was cut into pieces, Turkish official says
	
The body of missing journalist Jamal Khashoggi was cut into pieces after he was killed two weeks ago at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, a Turkish official told CNN today.
The claim, which was first made to the New York Times earlier in the investigation into Khashoggi's fate, comes after Turkish officials searched the consulate for nine hours on Monday night. The Turkish official would not comment on the disposal method for the body.
Turkish officials have said privately that Khashoggi was killed in the consulate on October 2 after he arrived to obtain papers that would have allowed him to marry his Turkish fiance, Hatice Cengiz.Saudi Arabia has previously insisted he left the building alive, but Cengiz says she never saw him again.
President Recep Tayyip Erdogan earlier Tuesday said Turkish investigators were looking into "toxic" and "painted over material" as part of their inquiry.
"My hope is that we can reach conclusions that will give us a reasonable opinion as soon as possible, because the investigation is looking into many things such as toxic materials and those materials being removed by painting them over," Erdogan told reporters.
CNN saw a cleaning crew enter the main consulate building on Monday before Turkish officials, including a forensics team, arrived to begin their investigation. (CNN)

## Title: Canonization of Blessed Oscar Romero : A modern day Martyr

Canonization of Blessed Oscar Romero : A modern day Martyr
	
Brothers, you are all killing your fellow countrymen. No soldier has to obey an order to kill. It is time to regain your conscience. In the name of God and in the name of the suffering people I implore you, I beg you, I order you, stop the repression.
Those were the words of Saint Oscar Romero, the then Archbishop of El Salvador on the day before he was assassinated by gunmen while celebrating Holy mass in a hospital chapel. The now famous words he uttered minutes before his death, continued as follows.
Those who surrender to the service of the poor through love of Christ will live like the grain of wheat that dies. It only apparently dies. If it were not to die, it would remain a solitary grain. The harvest comes because of the grain that dies. ... We know that every effort to improve society, above all when society is so full of injustice and sin, is an effort that God blesses; that God wants; that God demands of us.
38 years after he was gunned down by a Right Wing death squad, for allegedly siding with people and organizing peaceful protests against atrocities committed against the people by the Military Junta that ruled El Salvador, which the rulers took for siding with the Leftist militants fighting the Junta, Blessed Oscar Romero was declared a Saint by Pope Francis at the St. Peters Basilica last Sunday, cheered on by hundreds of thousands of devotees including former rebels of the Salvadoran Left wing.

A legacy so divisive
Ever since the death of Archbishop Oscar Romero on March 24, 1980, his name has been a rallying point for organizations fighting the right wing military Junta that governed El Salvador till elections in 1982.
Yet, it was only in the year 2010, when the country could have their first progressive President. Yet, the call for canonization of this remarkable servant of God and torch bearer of the Church among the poor and the oppressed in El Salvador, a Latin American country with 90% Catholic population, remained highly debatable and divisive a topic even among the upper echelons of the Vatican.
Despite objections, he was beatified in 2015 raising the hopes of faithful around the world. Yet, the prospect of canonizing him, which the devotees awaited , was stalled due to objections of the conservative officials at Vatican questioning the validity of considering his death as falling under the definition of martyrdom. They attributed politics more than faith for his assassination , in a context where he sided with the poor peasants of El Salvador as leftist militants were staging a struggle against US backed military Junta.

Redemption at the societal level
Yet the official announcement by Pope Francis naming him a martyr (a person dying for Faith) in 2015, surely redefines how a modern day martyr is to be recognized;, although not subscribing to what is known as Liberation Theology, he championed the cause for the poor and the marginalized, translating the redemptive work of Lord Jesus Christ to positive actions of mercy and compassion seeking social justice in the earthly sphere as well.
Romero, initially a conservative priest, was not opposed by the military rulers at his appointment as Archbishop of El Salvador. Yet the assassination of Rev. Rutillo Grande, a Jesuit priest working among peasants and a friend of Romero, in 1977, as well as time serving in the rural and poor region of Santiago de Mara, led to experience a transformation of sorts, prompting him to publicly denounce the violence unleashed by the military government, just as he had earlier denounced violent reprisals by the leftist guerrillas. His moving homilies delivered nationwide through radio was the only source of information on the atrocities of the military including abduction, murder, torture against peasants as media freedom was non- existent. Archbishop Romero went to the extent of writing the now world famous letter to the then US President Jimmy Carter, pleading to stop aiding the military rule that was causing immense suffering in El Salvador, Challenging the Americans on their professed Christian identity while funding a repressive regime.

Odium Fidei
The miracle necessary for the canonization under the Catholic tradition came in the form of the miraculous healing of an Salvadoran woman,Cecilia, who continuously had complications during her pregnancy and after delivery diagnosed with a condition which doctors called hopeless. Her husband, though resentful of the practice of the grandmother of his wife praying to the slain Prelate, accidentally came across a picture card carrying his photo kept inside the home Bible and pleaded for intercession on behalf of his wife. The cure was nothing short of the miraculous! Promptly recognized and authenticated by the Vatican, it provided the required miracle initiating the process for sainthood.
Although Romero had been proposed twice previously for canonization, it has been met with objection. Quite fittingly, it was left for the first ever Pope from the Latin American continent to recognize the merit of his life and sacrificial death , thus paving the way for Sainthood. The Holy Father declared that Romero was killed in hatred of the faith or Odium Fidei.
The violent and turbulent political climate, in which Saint Romero figures as the Archbishop, has lead skeptics to apportion too much a significance to the political aspect of his involvement for the betterment of the peasant population of El Salvador, as opposed to his spiritual legacy. Yet for the poor he was a true disciple of Jesus Christ ready to die for the heavy laden and the weary, exemplifying Jesuss call for readiness to die as a seed to bring forth new birth.

Traditional in a good sense
Contrary to popular perception, Saint Romero was never a communist or even a liberation theologian; neither did he belong to any particular group within or outside the church. In the opinion of the Peruvian Theologian Priest, Fr. Gustavo Gutirrez, Romero was not cloistered or encapsulated in only one current. If anything, the slain Prelate was a traditional person, but in the good sense: Not exactly conservative, but a very pious person.
His assassins were never brought to book and the hatred they had towards this Christ-like champion of the poor was manifest in the shooting massacre, slaughtering over 30 people and injuring scores , at his funeral attended by over 250,000 mourners. Yet neither violence nor intimidation could undermine the veneration not only the universal faithful but all free thinking and progressive masses had towards this pious man.
During the Assembly of the Conference of Latin American Bishops in Aparecida, Brazil in the year 2007, when Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio was asked about the late Prelate Romero this was the answer: to me [Romero] is a saint and a martyr  If I were Pope, I would have already canonized him.
Cardinal Bergoglio, did in fact, become Pope Francis and promptly raised Blessed Oscar Romero, the martyr, to sainthood three days ago on October 14 in Rome.
Saint Oscar Romero shines as a bright light in a dark world where spirituality is in retreat and where those who hold high position , including the clergy, use it for personal aggrandizement and self benefit; sacrificing himself for the cause of the poor and the exploited people who looked up to him as their spiritual leader.
As Sri Lankans belonging to any religion, we can only look on enviously and wish that we had religious leaders of that calibre. But we all know that we do not.

Cheap, low octane petrol for three-wheelers next month: Minister
	
A new petrol type would be introduced only for three-wheelers for low cost by next month, Petroleum Minister Arjuna Ranatunga said.
Speaking to the media at the Ministry today he said, the new petrol had a lower-octane value.
After I assumed duties as the Petroleum Minister, several major plans had been taken place to make new petrol type, which can be introduced to the market at a low cost, he said.
The new petrol type will be Rs. 8 lower than the current standard petrol price. This is done to rectify the issues with the three-wheeler industry, he said.
Several experiments are also underway to make the new petrol compatible with motorcycles, but we hope this will be used for certain old motor bicycles, he noted.
The Ministry had identified about 100 filling stations countrywide to issue this new petrol type. New pumping machines and tanks have to be installed at the identified filling stations. By next month the new petrol will be in the market, Minster Ranatunga said.
The Ministry is also hoping to discuss with the Finance Ministry to reduce taxes for this petrol. If we managed to reduce the tax for the new petrol type, we would be able to issue petrol at a very low price than the scheduled eight rupees.
This petrol type cannot be used in cars. If someone use this in cars, no responsibility would be taken by the Ministry for the damages caused to the engines, he added. (Chaturanga Samarawickrama)

Enterprise Sri Lanka: A vision to establish  an entrepreneurial society
	
Chandula Abeywickrema, Chairman of Lanka Impact Investing Network (LIIN) signs the agreement on behalf of Social Enterprise Fund and Haolianf Xu Assistant Secretary-General UN (Asia) witnessed by Thilak Marapana, Minister of Foreign Affairs for Sri Lanka and the Global Head of UNDP, Achim Steiner. 

Sri Lanka has depended on various sectors to drive its economic model forward. But with various challenges, the country had to seek alternatives to generate income. With the emergence of technology and more opportunities, the Small and Medium Enterprise (SME) sector began contributing to the countrys economy. In an attempt to encourage existing entrepreneurs and young minds to take up the concept of entrepreneurship, the government launched the Enterprise Sri Lanka subsidized loan scheme in June this year. Its aim is to create 100,000 new entrepreneurs. Through this programme 15 tailor-made locally and donor-funded financial and non-financial loans schemes have been launched. These aim to support the SME sector which has been recognised as the driving force of economic development. Through this programme the Government believes that it will be able to achieve its medium-term targets such as achieving a per capita income of US$ 5,000, one million new jobs, doubling of exports and the continuous growth of the GDP above 5%. Hence the sheds light on its expected benefits, the three categories of loan schemes and why the government decided to initiate this programme.


Expected benefits
Enterprise Sri Lanka will not only facilitate established private sector enterprises but also micro enterprises, self-employees, young entrepreneurs who will eventually be the driving forces of the existing economic model. Hence this programme is expected to bring in benefits for various sectors as follows:

SME Development: SMEs are the main source of economic growth and employment generation in the country. However, they face many challenges, especially when seeking loans as banks consider SME loans to be riskier and expensive than others. As a result, the government has implemented two locally funded and donor funded loan schemes named Jaya Isura in order to enhance the easy access to SMEs at an affordable rate. Here, the government bears the interest in the range of 50-100% on behalf of the end borrower and the end borrower can obtain a loan of 6- to 8% interest rate which is more convenient to do their business in a sustainable manner.
	
	Promoting green energy: Renewable energy generation is still at its infant stage and therefore the country depends on coal, oil and gas for fulfilling its energy requirement. Programmes such as the Soorya Bala Sangramaya have been launched to promote the usage of renewable energy. However, most people seem to be struggling to access concessionary finances to cover their investment costs. Therefore two loan schemes focusing on solar power generation have been introduced by this programme. These include the locally funded Rivi Bala Savi loan scheme to support households that establish solar power units on their rooftop whereas the Rooftop Solar Power Generation Line of Credit Project will be implemented with US$ 50 million funding support of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to encourage both households and industrialists to transfer solar power.
	
	Empowering farmer community and poverty reduction: Several policy measures have been taken in various capacities to eliminate poverty and reduce the poverty ratio below five per cent. Hence two loan schemes named Govi Navoda and Ran Aswenna have been introduced to provide financial support to farmers, farmer organisations and commercial scale agro companies to mechanise their agricultural activities. In addition to that, the loan schemes are also introduced to transform subsistent agriculture initiatives to commercial ones while raising the income level of farmers and developing small-scale producers into big exporters.
	
	Empowering youth: As means of empowering the youth, the Arabuma loan scheme has been introduced to encourage young graduates to enter into their economic development process by setting up innovative business ideas as a potential business by providing cash flow based loans at a zero interest rate with a full guarantee by the government.
	
	Empowering women: Although women form approximately 57% of the total population in Sri Lanka they still do not have as many opportunities to directly contribute to the economy. Therefore, priority has been given for women-led enterprises through the loan schemes and discussions have been initiated with the ADB to obtain a grant of US$ 10 million to provide for women-led enterprises under the Small and Medium Enterprise Line of Credit (SMELoC) project.
	
	Promoting exports and supply chain development: Under the theme Blue-Green Economy the government expects to double exports by 2020. Therefore, the Enterprise Sri Lanka programme has given priority to encourage existing exporters and start-ups while strengthening the supply chain of export products. Under the Jaya Isura loan scheme, the exporters are given two times higher loan amounts than other borrowers to encourage export-oriented industries.
	
	Promoting tourism sector: The tourism industry of Sri Lanka is already experiencing a boom and the government targets to achieve 4.5 million tourist arrivals with an income of US$ 7 billion by 2020. Hence the Home-stay programme has been encouraged to promote tourists to go to the countryside and enjoy traditional food and lifestyles. Hence the Programme aims to provide capital loans to upgrade such facilities.


Enterprise Sri Lanka subsidized loan scheme in June this year. Its aim is to create 100,000 new entrepreneurs


Financial and non-financial loan schemes
The loan schemes are categorized into interest subsidy loan scheme, donor-funded re-finance loan scheme and the financial plus non-financial support programme. A simplified operational model has been introduced to these schemes to avoid difficulties faced by end borrowers.

A. Interest Subsidy Loan Schemes
Step 1: The sub-borrower approaches the nearest branch of the Preferred Financial Institution (PFI  which include both government and private banks) and obtain a loan application and other necessary information.

Step 2: The sub-borrower applies for the sub-loan through the nearest branch of the PFI by submitting the loan application and other necessary documents.

Step 3: After evaluation, the PFI submits the loan application to the Department of Development Finance (DFD) for registration.

Step 4: DFD evaluates the proposal through a computerized system and issues registration letters to PFI to grant the loan within five working loans.

Step 5: PFI releases the loan for the respective sub-borrower at the concessionary interest rate.

B. Donor Funded Refinance Loan Scheme
Step 1 and 2 : (same as above)

Step 3: After the initial evaluation, PFI submits the application with relevant documents to seek reimbursement approval.

Step 4: DFD confirms the sub-project eligibility by reviewing the submitted documents and issues a no-objection note to PFI.

Step 5: After detail evaluation, the loan is granted to the sub-borrower by the PFI at their interest rate.

Step 6: PFI submits the reimbursement application to the Project Management United (PMU) and the PMU reimburse the eligible cost of the sub-project within three working days.

Step 7: The interest rate is then changed to the concessionary rate with effect from the date the reimbursed fund was received.


C. Other special loan schemes
Step 1: Appoint a sectoral evaluation committee and prepare necessary documents for calling and evaluating proposals.

Step 2: The Export Development Board (EDB) calls for proposals from the respective beneficiaries (eg: young graduate entrepreneurs for the Arabuma loan scheme) through advertisements.

Step 3:Proposals received from beneficiaries will be evaluated by the sectoral committee and viable projects will be selected.

Step 4: Selected projects are recommended to the PFIs for considering loan facilities.

Step 5: Selected beneficiaries will submit relevant documents to the PFI if necessary.

Step 6: PFIs evaluate the submitted proposals and select potential entrepreneurs.

Step 7: The government issues a guarantee for the selected loans and PFI grants the loan based on the government guarantee.
Entrepreneurship cannot be promoted culturally: Eran Wickramaratne

In his comments, State Minister of Finance and Mass Media Eran Wickramaratne said that there are 230,000 basic entrepreneurs and they are considered as outside the working population. Out of them, 75% fall into the Small and Medium Enterprise (SME) category. In Sri Lanka, only 2.8% of the total working population falls into the category of entrepreneurs, whereas in Vietnam and Thailand the rates are as high as 19.6% and 27.5% respectively. In our culture, we give first place to professionals and then only we look at entrepreneurs. Traditionally we have been asked to be a professional when we grow up. Therefore entrepreneurship cannot be promoted culturally.

The loan schemes are categorized into interest subsidy loan scheme, donor-funded re-finance loan scheme and the financial plus non-financial support programme

Speaking further he said that Enterprise Sri Lanka is about encouraging young minds where they are given an opportunity to thrive. As per our cultural dimensions, we have a dependency culture. We get free education and then we go to university and then some also demand for government jobs as well. Eventually, we also expect a pension. So through the Enterprise Sri Lanka concept, we are providing opportunities for young minds to be independent and take a responsibility. But a loan scheme is just part of the answer.
Explaining the programme, Wickramaratne said that banks are encouraged to evaluate based on the viability of the project. The government comes in to encourage the entire scheme. Hence it provides the interest subsidy and gives it to the banks that lend. The contract is between the contractor and the lending institution. We have felt the need for equity financing. There are some funds for startups in the Information-Communication Technology (ICT) sector but it has been slow in other areas. We are trying to get entrepreneurs on to the scheme and therefore it is not a political agenda.

Through the Enterprise Sri Lanka concept, we are providing opportunities for young minds to beindependent and take a responsibility. But a loan scheme is just part of the answer

Fighting to protect family honour!
	

A scion of an upcountry political dynasty has been caught red-handed accepting a big kickback while being the occupant of the main chair of a statutory body.

The offspring of this character is connected by marriage to a family whose ancestors are said to have had close ties to some Kandyan kings and his brother in law is a bigwig in a main political party.
Highly perturbed over the stigma staring the entire dynasty in the face, family members have reportedly appealed to some members of the foreign diplomatic community here to use their influence with the powers that be on behalf of their kinsman in hot water.
However, the law enforcement authorities at all levels are said to be determined to proceed with the case to its logical conclusion without giving in to the pressures coming from any quarter, they say.

His statement sent them into a panic!
	

The governing one of a province, where the big council is about to be dissolved, paid an official visit to a country in Europe recently.

Addressing the diaspora in fluent Tamil at several meetings in that country, the governing one had made an earnest request to them to return home with start-up capital to invest in development projects in his province.
He also had told them: I am going to be the sole authority in the province for about one year and those coming back prepared to make investments will get my full co-operation.
On hearing about the governing ones statement that he would oversee the provinces administration for another one year, the members of that provincial body had gone into a panic for that amounted to a prediction that holding of polls to the provincial body would be delayed by one year.
These members are reportedly running about these days looking for ways and means of averting the impending calamity.

It was a matter for him to laugh!
	

The news that the former strongman and Number One in Yahapalanaya had held a one-on-one powwow created a big stir in political circles recently.

This news had ruffled a senior Green purohita, who decided that the party chief- who was abroad at that time- should be posted on this unexpected development.
However, instead of contacting the Green Chief directly, he phoned up a senior colleague, who was in the team that accompanied the chief.
After apprising his colleague of all about this disturbing development, he had warned that they had to make an effective counter-move before the worst possible could come to pass.
However, the response he got from his colleague at the other end of the line was something quite unexpected.
The colleague was laughing uncontrollably!
Ha! Ha! Ha! coming over the phone infuriated the Senior Purohita.
I say, is what I told you a joke for you to laugh Cant you understand that this is a serious matter
The colleague laughed again. After controlling his mirth, he had told him:
My dear friend, dont take this matter seriously! Our people usually say something in the morning and an entirely different thing in the afternoon! Consider this meeting as something as unimportant as say, a fart! This is not something to worry out but, something to laugh about!

Macron announces cabinet reshuffle in bid to regain momentum
	

DPA, 16th OCTOBER, 2018-Two weeks after the resignation of French interior minister Gerard Collomb, President Emmanuel Macron has announced a successor to the post as part of a wider government reshuffle.
Collombs successor will be the leader of La Republique en Marche (LREM), Christophe Castaner, the Elysee Palace announced on Tuesday.
Castaner, part of Macrons inner circle, will give up the party post.
In his inauguration speech, the new interior minister named the fight against terrorism and the safety of every resident as his priorities.
Laurent Nunez, who had headed the domestic intelligence agency, was appointed to Castaners side as future secretary of state on Tuesday.
The cabinets new culture minister is Franck Riester, the new minister for agriculture is Didier Guillaume and Jacqueline Gourault was named the new minister of territorial cohesion.
Macron and French Prime Minister Edouard Philippe had taken an unusually long time to announce the reshuffle, which drew criticism from the opposition, who last week called the delays a tragicomedy.
The reshuffle comes as Macron seeks to regain momentum in the face of poor polling figures after a difficult summer.
Collombs brusque departure on October 2 added to an impression of disarray after popular environment minister Nicolas Hulot resigned live on air in August. The departure of Collomb was a tough blow for Macron, as the ex-mayor of Lyon was an important, long-standing supporter. The presidents summer had already been spoiled by a scandal over an alleged assault on protesters by a presidential security aide.

Middle Class is not a progressive class
	

David North the Chairman of the Socialist Equality Party in the United States and the theoretical leader of the Fourth International, which bases its ideology on Leon Trotsky and the Internationalism contained therein sat down with the Daily Mirror for an interview. The Author and international socialist spoke of a wide range of issues of which excerpts are published below.

The opposition to Kavanaugh was not based on his real demons
	History is rife with defending unpopular positions and being absolved of such defence
	We have never once betrayed our principles in search of quick solutions

Q David, we welcome you to this interview, I believe the first of its kind with the . To start off with, about the Left in Sri Lanka- Socialist, Communist parties one of the main issues is about the preoccupation with theory. A theory, which has failed to convince the masses, in Sri Lanka. You could feel that the message has not been conveyed to them. Why do you think the Left as we deem it is still caught up in this theoretical bubble
I have to be critical frankly about the way the question is posed. It depends on how one understands politics, on how one understands also the relationship of politics to theory. Let me put it this way. I have come to Sri Lanka to give lectures on the theory of the history of the 4th International.
Building a political party is a very complex process. It is not like a businessman building a hotel. But when one deals with politics, one deals with much more complicated processes involving the lives of millions of people. One has to investigate the objective processes, which give rise and also the different influences in terms of the political experience of the masses. Now, for us, the 20th century was the most revolutionary in history.
You can say it was the century of world revolution. Massive social movement embracing the working class.
Undoubtedly the most important political event of the 20th century was the Russian revolution.
The October revolution, the coming into power of the Bolsheviks resulting in the first workers state in history, which not only transformed Russia and established the Soviet Union but it had immense global consequences. Politics was changed throughout the world. The Bolsheviks believed this to be the beginning of the worlds Socialist revolution and in many fundamental aspects, they were right.

We also believe that the masses are going to come to conflict with established political parties and our work is based on it. Now it isnt a guaranteed success but it does point a way forward

And yet we know, that by the end of the century the Soviet Union had been dissolved. China which also went through massive social revolution underwent the restoration of capitalism.
And how is this to be explained I mean if you ask the question about the masses, they are increasingly dissatisfied with the world that exists  the world of massive inequality, the concentration of the wealth among a small elite. And yet how can you expect the masses to be drawn to socialism without understanding the fate of the socialist movement.
Any discussion of that brings up the fate of Trotskys struggle against Stalinism. That was the most monumental political, the theoretical struggle of the 20th century. Stalin came to power representing a bureaucracy which claimed that socialism can be built in one country apart from the socialist revolution in the world. Flowing from these policies which were in stark contrast to what gave rise to the Bolshevik Revolution in 1917, tied the fate of socialism throughout the world. That produced catastrophic defeats to the working class in the country after country.
Fascism took power in Germany, the world war erupted. The working class suffered massive defeats. During that time Trotskyism was a small minority, only in a few countries. Yet, the objective events have vindicated the perspective upon which the 4th International was based. And so a historical standpoint- explaining these lessons, building a political movement upon assimilation is important. These are complicated issues. What will return the message to the revolution What are the powerful forces that will return the working class to it Only fundamentally objective forces of the global economy and the breakdown of political forces which we are seeing now

Q But arent we seeing that all these objective forces you speak of are giving rise to the exact opposite. The rise of Right Wing movements and the rejection of Globalism across the world
I think what we are seeing here is first all that it is fundamentally a crisis of the Bourgeoisie System. The breakdown of the Bourgeoisie system is what we are seeing here. This is what also gave rise to the 4th International because at that time it was claimed that Bourgeoisie democracy would be defended which led to disaster. But what you must understand is the breakdown of Bourgeoisie democracy is an expression of a deep and fundamental disease of the capitalist system.
Now, why is the Right wing gaining momentum Because so-called Left movements which are not really the Left- it is really an indictment of all those parties which have fundamentally abandoned the working class who have abandoned the causes of the working class and either taken up to various forms of identity politics and taken up to middle-class politics. If you examine the social layer which propagates identity politics  it really is the politics of the middle class. They really dont address the issues of the working class. Lets look at the situation in the United States.
Why did Donald Trump come to power The Democratic Party, which is a Capitalist party is a party which has no programme for the working class, which advocates market economics and American Militarism.
The only difference they seem to have with Donald Trump is on if the War should be with China or with Russia. No one is speaking of the real problems of the workers. Where are they talking about unemployment, social inequality Elements of the Right are exploiting this vacuum. Steve Bannon was to recently say that every time the Left talks about Gender politics it helps them because they are speaking of the issues of the middle classes.
Take the controversy about Kavanaugh. He is a dyed in the wool reactionary, he helped design the torture programme, he is the worst sort of Right Wing politician. But the Democrats chose  they chose to make the allegation about an incident which may or may not have happened 35 years ago. Why did they do that Because they werent appealing to the working class by opposing Kavanaugh based on profound class factors. Rather they were appealing to an Upper Middle-class layer which is drunk on Sexual Politics of an extremely undemocratic character. And it is not a politics which appeal to the broad masses of people.

The only difference they seem to have with Donald Trump is on if the War should be with China or with Russia. No one is speaking of the real problems of the workers

Q I got back to my fundamental question, as to why havent your- Marxist, Leninist Forces -been able to galvanise the masses today
We have made extreme inroads in the past twenty years or so. The World Socialist Website is one of the most widely read publications in the world, despite the continuous blockings from all major forces. We have fathered around our programme a global audience, yes it isnt a mass audience but I am convinced that it will do so in the future. For 30 years the working class has been suppressed by the Trade Unions.
This is an international phenomenon to block every independent movement of the working class. Now for the 1st time in 30 years, you could see a resurgence of the class struggle and the working class is radicalizing. You know the situation in America is very contradictory. Lets take the figure of Bernie Sanders from my stand point he is not a socialist but he spoke of the Political Revolution. If he was the candidate of the Democratic Party he would have easily beaten Donald Trump, but the Democratic Party isnt interested in any kind of serious reform programme so he wasnt the candidate. But he was largely a diversion because he was largely a party of the Democratic Party. I raised this to show you that social processes are very complicated- because in America the land which there is supposedly no sympathy toward socialism, a person who called himself a socialist was able to garner the interest that he did. Whether he was or was not a socialist in reality is a different question altogether. But the issue now is, with the resurgence of class struggle internationally new conditions would emerge. What we are witnessing now is a realignment of social forces, the old order is breaking down.

Q To stop you there David has this not been the call always of the Communists That the Revolution is inevitable and is impending. That the social conditions that came about following the globalist domination after World War 2, it will necessarily give rise to this socialist revolution. Even in Sri Lanka until what took place in the 60s and the 70s was this not the slogan or belief
Socialism is not inevitable if you mean by inevitability that socialism will take place independent of political leadership, no it is not inevitable. What is inevitable is the intense and immense crisis of capitalism by the very operations of the laws which govern it. What we are talking about is about social processes of a conflict between classes, of political forces. The ruling elites are seeking to find ways out of their dilemma. The problem is that within the capitalist framework the solutions they seek dont help humanity but generally have catastrophic consequences.

Q Again we have established that
Yes we have. But what we do experience is that Political parties which have a vested interest in the prevailing system doing everything they can to block the emergence of a real social movement. Now, the Revolutionary forces themselves must take the initiative to try to find a way out of this dilemma. We saw what happened in the 1990s with the emergence of technology. We were one of the very first publications to embrace the internet. We introduced newspapers since the very founding of our organization, we saw the internet gave the chance to reach a wide audience and embraced it.
Despite extreme censorship from Google which we have documented, we have a wide readership across the globe. Our readership still persists. We also believe that the masses are going to come to conflict with established political parties and our work is based on it. Now it isnt a guaranteed success but it does point a way forward. We are counting two factors. One, the objective factors of the development of capitalism and secondly that these factors are going to result in the radicalization of the working class which we are now witnessing.
Within the system, there will be renewed interest in the socialist system. Workers understand almost instinctively that a struggle has consequences. Its not the outlook of a middle-class student who can protest and go home and enjoy a high standard of living. Workers understand that Jobs, lives are at risk. They have to have confidence in a political party. And how does a party gain its confidence Firstly by demonstrating that it has the capacity to fight and its capacity to present a correct programme and also to demonstrate that in its history it has upheld principles. So now we find more and more people interested in our programme in America.
Many of them have told us that they could not imagine that a year ago they would be talking to a Socialist party. I know where you are coming from and I hear this argument very often but politics is a much more complicated realm. You say you havent been successful and I dont agree.

Q Let us take your argument that is a complicated process. But we are seeing forces that appeal to the masses across the world. My main dilemma is with this insistence on theoretical purity by the Hard Left. Now lets take the example of Corbyn, or Melenchlon in France, even Sanders who have been able to galvanise the masses. But yet, the Hard Left still seems to be still insisting on theoretical purity and rejecting them. If you take Sri Lanka the reality is that the Socialist Equality Party has not made any inroads. You could be patting yourself on the back with regard to its purity but the reality is they have not made inroads.
I must say I rather welcome this discussion. I am not offended and it is a very fundamental and critical issue. First I would make it clear that the problem of the Left has been anything but theoretical purity.
The establishment of unprincipled alliances, what is called opportunism  which is the search for easy and quick solutions which dont correspond to an objectively correct evaluation of a political situation that is the real problem. Take for example Corbyn or Sanders. Now it is well known that when masses begin to first radicalize, safety models emerge which direct the anger of the masses into political channels which do not ultimately challenge the establishment.
Now, you are correct to say that masses dont come into politics with a great amount of theoretical knowledge, without an unwareness of political history or processes. The masses dont begin with that and they may initially give their allegiance to charlatans. If a person is sick with cancer he is prepared to listen to almost anybody. Also, sorts of cures gain popularity. The obligation of a serious political party is not to go along with them. Take a concrete example, Syriza ( Greek Left Wing Party) came with the promise of the political revolution. We opposed it, we said that Syriza will betray the masses before it did. It didnt take years for it to happen, it took only weeks. We saw the consequences. Jeremy Corbyn is another similar example, he comes under attack and his reaction is to retreat. The Right Wing still control the Labour Party and it always will. But the masses go through these experiences and learn through mistakes provided that it learns through a party which consistently seeks to educate them and wins their confidence. Now I present to you the question what is the alternative Because in presenting your argument the fundamental basis is If you cant beat em join em.
Now you spoke of my comrades of the SEP in Sri Lanka and I must defend them. It is true that they have yet not been able to win the confidence of the masses, but have their positions been They opposed Tamil Nationalism, they opposed Sinhalese chauvinism. Trotsky once said, we cant be responsible for others, we can be responsible for only ourselves. The fact that a principled line doesnt immediately translate in a narrow pragmatic sense is not an argument against a political position. You know when you look back in history, if you look at Lenin who opposed the War in 1914 he was a part of a small minority, and now you look back and think what a brilliant position he took- to defend an unpopular position and to be in a minority in doing so.

What we are talking about is about social processes of a conflict between classes, of political forces. The ruling elites are seeking to find ways out of their dilemma. The problem is that within the capitalist framework the solutions they seek dont help humanity but generally have catastrophic consequences

Q I still havent got the answer I was seeking at the start of this interview.
I have been telling you, but you havent been listening

Q One of the main arguments among the middle class, so to say, in Sri Lanka at least, against Marxist- Leninist movements, is that the local movements are far from being truly international, far from progressive politics. If you take the recent struggles of the so-called Left, it lacks a very basic component of international or progressive ideology or of technology. I should be excused for using this term, but what it really is- is a village like Socialism despite all the advances we as a species have made. How do you think this should be addressed
Well what you are speaking of is a Sri Lankan manifestation of an international phenomenon of the Pseudo Left. I speak of the Pseudo Left which can be identified as a strand of the Frankfurt School of thought. It rooted in the rejection of enlightenment, rejection science. You are right, what dominates today is not Marxism, its various forms of irrationalism and anti-progress. The middle class is always going to gravitate to these types of theories because they are not a progressive class, they dont have a perspective. So, I think it is important to see through these ideologies.

Mom wants me to quit politics: Senasinghe
	
Denying the bribery allegation over the high-speed railway project, State Minister of International Trade Sujeewa Senasinghe said that his mother had asked him to leave politics due to continual issues coming towards him.
He said that he was forced into politics; however, he had scored well and secured more votes gradually.
The State Minister said that though it was difficult to do politics he couldnt give up and let down his voters.
He said that it was unfortunate that anyone could throw allegations by holding a press conference and he was distressed by the issue as he was innocent.
To approve the project or whatever they have said, that the State Minister had asked for a bribe, and that is thuggery.
Most investors come and they want to take a picture with me. Im a person who is very accessible. Anyone can meet me. Im not scared. But now Im scared.
If I meet you what you would tell me next time Why should I ask a bribe if Im not involved with the BOI he said.
Ceylon High-Speed Railway (CHSR) Limited had submitted an application to 488 million Euro mega integrated high-speed train manufacturing plant project in October 2016 to the Board of Investment (BOI) approval.
However a year later, the project was sent to be evaluated by the Cabinet appointed Single Window Investment Appraisal Committee (SWIAC).
The director board recently in a press briefing allegedly charged that Development Strategies and International Trade Malik Samarawickrama and State Minister of International Trade Sujeewa Senasinghe kept delaying the project seeking a ten percent of the investment as a bribe.
MP Senasinghe said the project was deferred as the investor had failed to submit the required business proposal requested by the SWIAC.
He claimed that such a company was non-existent and there was no Italian investor, although the Board of Directors claimed so.
He said that the board of Directors of the said company had been given several opportunities to provide necessary documents but they failed to do so.
He added they still could provide the requested details.
When asked the director, where the money was coming from he responded that it was a secret. What is the secret about the project proposal and the financial sources He said that Italians are involved in the project, which is another lie. There are charges against the whole family in this project. And they are making charges against us. Anybody can bring a proposal to the BOI. But there are many regulations they should fulfil to seek approval, he added.
MP Senasinghe said he had written to the President, the Prime Minister, the IGP, the FCID and the CID seeking justice.
He said that the law enforcement authorities should take swift action and investigate into the matter.
I dont know whether to laugh or to cry. It is very unfortunate we have to face such situations. I obtained the background and the CRIB Reports of two Directors of the company who are residents of Ja-Ela.
Action must be taken against them as there is a huge credit against their names.
In my complaint letters, I have urged them to take action and to safeguard us as politicians. We are young politicians doing politics with principles and dignity.
The media also has a duty to report the truth. Not just publish both sides and say that they are neutral.
Do investigative journalism, go through the documentation, ask questions from these people and then if you are satisfied then publish it.
You dont have to be partial towards any side. I think swift measures should be taken. Through Good Governance, we have brought a lot of freedom to the media. That freedom should not be misused. And I would urge President also to have a responsibility. The Prime Minister also has a responsibility in safeguarding us not only those who are close to them. They have a responsibility to safeguard clean and young politicians, MP Senasinghe said.
Im taking legal action against all the individuals who made this allegation and the media institutions that supported them. Laws must be brought in Parliament to prevent tarnishing political characters. Freedom is good only as long as it is in the right hands, the State Minister said. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

Mystery surrounding the dumping of the unairworthy airbus!
	

Our national airline had taken on lease an airbus from a foreign country about two years ago and had re-leased it soon after to a European country.

The lessee-airline had been required under the lease-agreement to return the craft in a good flying condition after effecting the necessary repairs if the need is upon the expiration of the lease period.
When the lease had expired, our engineers had flown to that European country to check its flight viability and had found its condition had deteriorated to the extent of being almost unairworthy.
So, our engineers had told the foreign airline that our national airline was not prepared to accept the airbus unless it was restored to a sound flying condition.
However, a few days later, the engineers concerned had discovered to their horror that the airbus which they had condemned as not being airworthy had been brought back without effecting any repairs and parked in a hangar at our main airport and the pilots who had brought it had disappeared.
Meanwhile, informed sources say that there are one or two politicos behind dumping on us the unairworthy airbus which has already cost the taxpayers several millions of rupees.

While rejecting accusations by various parties over the selling of Trincomalee Oil Tank Farm to India, Petroleum Minister Arjuna Ranatunga said the Ministry has not decided to sell the oil tanks which are not being used.
Speaking to the Media at the Ministry yesterday, Minister Ranatunga said his Ministry had no intention to sell the Trincomalee Oil Tank Farm and will not engage in any agreement that brings disadvantage to the country.
Therefore, the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) had decided to launch a joint venture programme with the Indian Oil Company (IOC) to develop the remaining 85 Oil Tanks.
"Another financial contract need to be signed along with the agreement, but it was not signed as yet. 15 oil tanks are already being used by the IOC following an agreement signed between Sri Lanka and India in 2003 and it will remain for another 18 years," he said.
With the possible launching of the joint venture programme, 16 tanks would be retained for the use of CPC and the remainder would be developed and maintained as a joint venture by the CPC and the LIOC.
As a responsible Minister, I have decided to submit a Cabinet paper to keep the land ownership of the Trincomalee oil tank farm under the Government of Sri Lanka.
The retained 16 oil tanks will facilitate in expediting transportation of fuel in the Northern and Eastern provinces. This would help the ministry to save the transportation cost to bring fuel from Colombo. (Chaturanga Samarawickrama)

Even after Premier Ranil Wickremesinghe submits the delimitation review report to President Maithripala Sirisena by October 28, PC polls cannot be held until amendments if any are approved by Parliament, Election Commission Chairman Mahinda Deshapriya said yesterday.
He said however, the President was required to gazette the report no sooner he receives it.
Mr. Deshapriya said the term of office of the five-member review committee headed by the Prime Minister ends on October 28 two months after it was appointed by Speaker Karu Jayasuriya.
There are no provisions to extend the deadline. As such the report has to be handed over to the President by October 28. Although the President has to gazette the report soon after it is received, PC polls can only be held after amendments if any are approved by Parliament, he said.
Mr. Deshapriya said the dates were uncertain against the background of the GCE O/L in December and public servants involved in transfers and the annual budget. (Sandun A Jayasekera)

It is public knowledge now that a secret meeting between the former strongman and Number One did take place despite an immediate denial by the peace-maker who played the host.

Both parties to this powwow, which was expected to remain a top secret, had got a jolt when the media reported the story the following day itself.
Number One on his part had used his intelligence arm to track down the person who had leaked the news to the media and he had found that an NGO man with a moniker meaning new-gem  incidentally a close pal of the peace-maker had done the damage.
An irate Number One had sent for the peace-maker and given him a tongue-lashing. Chastised, the man had lost no time in rushing to the media to deny there had been such a meeting at his residence, they say.

We all know that the most amount of food wasted daily in the country is from Parliament. A majority of the MPs do not attend the sessions at Parliament. Even if they do so, they never have their meal there. Therefore, most of the food prepared daily, is wasted. I have witnessed this for the last 27 years as a member of parliament.

President grants Rs.14 Customs Tax to release sugar stock at Port
	
Following discussions held with President Maithripala Sirisena at the President Secretariat yesterday, he had agreed to release the sugar stocks already at the harbour under Rs.14 customs tax concession, Sugar Importers' Association member Priyantha Senavirathne said.
Speaking to the Daily Mirror he said 5,000 tonnes of sugar was already stuck at the Colombo Port after imposing an extra control price.
A sugar importer has to pay Rs. 44.50 as customs tax and Rs. 58.50 when unloading a kilo of sugar from the Port. Another Rs. 3 has to be spent on transport and service tax, he said.
Therefore, the Association had requested the President to release the Customs tax imposed on sugar imports. But the President did not agree. Finally it came to a conclusion of reducing the Customs release tax to Rs. 31 until the imported stocks get cleared from the Port.
He said the President was also told to have a more detailed discussion at the next Cost of Living Committee meeting.
The price of a metric tonne of sugar in the Indian market which was at US$ 340, US$ 400 in the London market and US$ 390 in the New York Market had been increased by US$ 8 from yesterday, he said.
Mr. Senavirathne said the Association had decided to stop importing sugar temporarily due to the world market and Indian market sugar price hike and after imposing an extra control price on sugar import by the Government.
The Association yesterday requested a discussion with the Finance Ministry and the President. (Indika Sri Aravinda)

President never mentioned RAW: PMD
	
With reference to recent local and international media reports that President Maithripala Sirisena was reported to have mentioned at the Cabinet meeting held on Tuesday (16), about an alleged plot to assassinate him by the Indian Intelligence agency Research and Analysis Wing (RAW), the President Media Division (PMD) today clarified that the President had not mentioned any involvement of an Indian intelligence service.
Issuing a media release, it said in the Cabinet Meeting on Tuesday, the discussions had taken place on the alleged plot to assassinate the President.
It said:
In the meeting, the President emphasized the need to conduct a comprehensive investigation into the alleged assassination plot. Among other topics discussed at various times during the said Cabinet meeting, was the development of the Eastern terminal of the Colombo Port. The President high lighted the importance of Sri Lanka has a deep-sea port terminal in the interest of the national economy.
India and Sri Lanka have maintained cordial relations and cooperation since the inception of this Government. Several high-level visits have taken place between the two nations that have resulted in strengthening cooperation in many fields.
The PMD also wishes to state that, the High Commissioner of India called on the President this morning and during the meeting, all matters were clarified and bilateral relations were reassured.
In these circumstances, it is very unfortunate that some parties with vested interests resort to spreading such malevolent manipulations detrimental to the existing good relations between the two countries as well as the excellent personal rapport between the two leaders, the statement said.

President Sirisena alleges that RAW is plotting his assassination
	
(The Hindu) 
In a move that might seriously impair Indo-Lanka relations, Sri Lankan President Maithripala Sirisena on Tuesday accused Indias Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) of plotting his assassination.
Mr. Sirisena, who was speaking at the weekly Cabinet meeting, told Ministers that the Indian intelligence agency was trying to kill him, but that Prime Minister Narendra Modi may not be aware of the plan, The Hindu has learnt from sources present at the discussion.
We were just shocked when he said it, a source said, requesting anonymity.
When contacted for verification, a senior officer at the Presidents media unit said: We will verify this and revert. However, there has been no response till the time of going to print.
President Sirisenas claim comes days before Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghes scheduled visit to New Delhi, where he will meet Mr. Modi to discuss bilateral matters, including key, India-assisted projects on the island.
However, this is not the first time a Sri Lankan leader has accused the Indian agency of interference. Following his poll defeat in 2015, former President Mahinda Rajapaksa held RAW among those responsible for the change in regime. Mr. Sirisenas allegation, sources at the meeting said, came when he raised concerns over the governments indifference to an assassination plot targeting him. Reports of the said plot emerged last month when an individual named Namal Kumara, part of an anti-corruption outfit, claimed he was aware of a plan to assassinate Mr. Sirisena and former Defence Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa.
The CID interrogated Mr. Kumara. The police subsequently also arrested an Indian national late in September. Local media reported that the Indian, identified as M. Thomas hailing from Kerala, claimed he knew of the plot.
However, the Sri Lankan government issued an elaborate denial to the report and clarifications came from the highest level. Media Minister, Mangala Samaraweera slammed it as a disinformation campaign, urging reporters to be responsible.
At Tuesdays meeting, Mr. Sirisena reportedly said the Indian national must be a RAW agent trying to kill me. The Indian PM may not be aware. That is often the case. Trump may not be aware of CIAs similar moves.
The Hindu, on Tuesday evening, spoke to multiple sources in government  across political parties  who attended the meeting, and they confirmed this.
Tuesdays meeting also saw a heated argument between President Sirisena and Mr. Wickremesinghe, when a cabinet paper on developing the Colombo Port came up for discussion. Sources said Mr. Sirisena vehemently objected to any Indian involvement in upgrading its east container terminal  a project that New Delhi has been keen to take up.
However, Mr. Wickremesinghe is said to have countered by saying Colombo had already promised New Delhi on collaborating on the project, and it was important to rope in India at the terminal, given that about 80% of the cargo handled at the transhipment hub was meant for India. He reportedly sought a weeks time to sort out the issue, since he would be meeting Mr. Modi soon.
Meanwhile, the Presidents media unit on Tuesday called off a scheduled press meet by Mr. Sirisenas advisers on the reported assassination plot.
When contacted, Presidential adviser Shiral Lakthilaka told The Hindu: We cancelled it because we are awaiting more information. Asked if it was connected to Mr. Sirisenas reported remarks at the Cabinet, he said: No, it had nothing to do with that.

Prez - PM showdown at Cabinet
	
President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe are reported to have had a showdown at yesterdays Cabinet meeting over the proposal to develop the East Container Terminal of the Colombo Port as an Indian investment.
At the meeting, Ports and Shipping Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe submitted a Cabinet memorandum on developing the terminal by the Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA).
However, the Prime Minister, backed by Development Strategies and International Trade Minister Malik Samarawickrama, insisted that it should be on the basis of an Indian investment.
Apparently incensed by the Prime Ministers remarks, the President was reported to have said that it was vital to keep the sea port within the ambit of the Sri Lankan Government and that as a country Sri Lanka would lose its sovereignty in the event of alienating sea ports to external parties.
The President is also reported to have been critical of the leasing of the Hambantota Port to a Chinese Company and said he had discussed the development of the Colombo Port with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi when he met him on the sidelines of the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC).
Indian Prime Minister is not opposed to the development of the East Container Terminal of the Colombo Port by Sri Lanka, he said.
However, the Prime Minister had persisted in saying that a bulk of container traffic for the Colombo Port originated from India and therefore, it was all the more important to develop it with India.
Sources said the President and the Prime Minister had continued hurling arguments at each other. (Kelum Bandara)

Racism vs Liberalism: The European battle between Matteo Salvini and Emmanuel Macron - EDITORIAL
	
Politics is too serious a matter to be left to the politicians  Charles de Gaulle

The mercurial rise of the Italian Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini at a time French President Emmanuel Macrons domestic approval ratings hit an all-time low, has become a concern not only in Europe but the rest of the world as well. After all the two young leaders represent the two sides of the European immigrant story. 
The 45-year-old anti-immigrant Salvini whom the west considers the most powerful man in Italy today is peaking at a time when his antithesis in the European immigrant story, the 40-year-old French President is being accused by his countrymen of being too authoritarian. 
A recent poll shows that 79% of the French population today thinks that Macron is authoritarian and 71% think he is arrogant. While the French leader still enjoys a fair degree of global appeal due to his youthful looks, sophistication and eloquence theres a general perception in the country that he has lost touch with the common man.
His advice to an unemployed youth at a public open house at the Elysee Palace last month only went to prove that the public was not wrong. A video shows Macron advising an unemployed youth who was looking for a gardeners job to go looking for one in cafes, restaurants and construction sites. The fact that the former banker Macron is insulated from the ordinary man today is a fact that even his wife Brigitte Macron has admitted. 
Now, unfortunately, we are alone. Thats what living in the Elyse Palace does to you: we cant trust anyone but each other. Were lonely together, but lonely neverthelessI trust Emmanuel and Emmanuel trusts me. Thats all that matters, she was quoted as saying recently. 
The media also reported that 65-year-old Brigitte Macron has advised the presidents staff to let the president know that he is too arrogant and snappy with the public something that she too finds him to be. 
While the French president is grappling with his plummeting approval ratings the popular Italian Deputy Minister Salvini, who is also the countrys Interior Minister last weekend decided to dismantle a model town of ethnic integration. Hundreds of immigrants, mainly ethnic Africans of the Southern town of Riace are now slated to move out and spread in various parts of the country. Early this month the mayor of the town, Domenico Luciano who is also a human rights activist, was arrested for helping immigrants. 
A few days back, Salvini proposed that countrys little ethnic shops should close by 9.00 pm claiming that these late night shops, run largely by South Asians, are a meeting place for drug deals and people who raise hell. 
While these anti-immigrant Salvinis aggressive moves have a strong appeal to the native Italians they have created a fear psychosis among the South Asian population comprising Indians, Bangladeshis, Sri Lankans and Africans. It is estimated that nearly a hundred thousand Sri Lankans, including the illegal immigrants are there in Italy right now and most of them are concentrated in the Lombardy region in the northwest of the country. Today migrants make up 20% of Lombardy capital Milan, the global fashion and design centre. 
A few weeks back burgeoned by his growing popularity in the region Salvini who works for hand in hand with French hardliner Marine Le Pen went on to attack Macron over his handling of the immigrant issue. 
The influx of immigrants no doubt has created multiple issues in Italy and the rest of Europe. However the solutions, the moderates feel, should not be decided by the hardliners like Salvini and Le Pen. 
Let us not be naive, globalization is going through a major crisis and this challenge needs to be collectively fought by states and civil society in order to find and implement global solutions, Emmanuel Macron was heard saying at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland early this year. 
However, given the manner he has let down his own nation Macrons story has failed to inspire other aspiring European leaders to follow his path of liberalism.

Rajitha downplays assassination plot on Prez.
	
Cabinet Spokesman Health Minister Dr Rajitha Senaratne today downplayed the conspiracy theory of an alleged attempt on the lives of President Maithripala Sirisena and former Defence Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa and added there was still no sufficient evidence to prove an assassination plot.
Responding to the Daily Mirror at the weekly Cabinet news briefing yesterday, Minister Senaratne said the Government Analyst had not said that the recordings of a telephone conversation between Police informer and plot informer Namal Kumara were of suspected DIG Nalaka Silva.
What the Government Analyst has said only that recordings were not fake and it contained telephone conversations between two parties. The CID must now find out that whether the conversations were genuinely that of Nalaka and Namal, Minister Senaratne said.
Responding to another question, Minister Senaratne said there was no concrete evidence to arrest DIG Silva either.
Who is this Namal He is a Police informer who works for money. He has been paid Rs. 500,000 by the Police and he had expected more. He did not get it and this was what happened, I presume.
Besides, not only he but all drug and ganja traffickers, underworld characters and even criminals provide information to Police, Minister Senaratne stressed.
Minister Senaratne said there were attempts to involve India also into the assassination plot by dragging an Indian angle to the controversy with the intention to create a division between the two countries.
Answering another question, Minister Senaratne said former President Mahinda Rajapaksa and his fellow travellers must not get excited when the Government took action against criminals, who assassinated journalist Lasantha Wickramatunga and ruggerite Thajudeen, attacked Keith Noyahr, Upali Tennakoon and set fire in Sirasa and Siyatha.
Yes, we sent all those responsible for those crimes to jail or to the gallows. When we take action against the criminals under the law, they cry foul saying that they have been politically victimized.
But I assure you that action will be taken against all those who committed those crimes under the Rajapaksa regime notwithstanding whether they are powerful politicians, so-called war heroes or priests, Minister Senaratne said
He added that the Yahapalana Government was elected to meet those objectives. (Sandun Jayasekara)

Saudis prepare to admit Khashoggi died  in botched interrogation
	
Saudi Arabia is preparing to admit that journalist Jamal Khashoggi was killed in a botched interrogation - government insiders have revealed.
According to CNN, the Saudi Arabian government is preparing a report which will say Khashoggi died in an interrogation that was intended to end with his abduction from Turkey.
CNN said that two sources had leaked the report, which is said to be still in its preliminary stages, and it will say the interrogation was carried out without clearance and transparency and that those involved will be held responsible.
One of the sources reportedly told the network that the report could change and is still being prepared. U.S. President Donald Trump confirmed on Monday he had seen the news about the Saudi report, but argued nobody knows if it was an official report.
I heard that report, but nobody knows if its an official report. So far, its just a rumor of a report coming out, The President said while visiting Georgia to inspect the devastation caused by Hurricane Michael. 
The revelation comes as team of Turkish and Saudi officials tonight entered the Saudi consulate in Istanbul for a joint inspection two weeks after the Washington Post journalist apparently vanished inside.
The inspection was agreed after Saudi King Salman and Turkish President Erdogan spoke yesterday for the first time since Turkey accused the Saudis of killing and dismembering Jamal Khashoggi who criticised the Saudi crown prince.(Daily Mail), October 15, 2018

Trump sends Pompeo to Riyadh
THE HINDU, 16th OCTOBER, 2018-Saudi Arabia is preparing to acknowledge the death of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi in a botched interrogation, CNN and the New York Times said on Monday, after U.S. President Donald Trump speculated rogue killers may be responsible. Mr. Trump dispatched Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to meet King Salman over the case that has strained the Americans relationship with the Saudis, carefully cultivated by the U.S. President.

A REVIEW OF THE NOVEL PEMATHO JAAYATHI ASOKO BY ISURU PRASANGA PUBLISHED BY FAST PUBLISHING


This is the motto of the novel published by journalist turned novelist, Isuru Prasanga, titled Pemato Jaayati Asoko (Loosely translated as sorrowlessness arises from endearment). Among the recently published Sinhala novels that I have read to date, this had a considerable impact on me. I was reluctant to start on this novel since I have heard of the author more as a journalist with a political consciousness, rather than a writer of fiction. I, like most, did not fancy wasting the limited reading time that the modern-day allows, on the propaganda of any political ideology.
However, when I kept aside the novel upon its completion, I had no doubt that I would have lost out on the deal, had I skipped this novel.

Bohemian vagrancy:

The main character of this work is a man by the name of Ravindu  he is in his early forties by the end of the novel. In the thirty or thirty-five years that we associate with him in these pages, it is apparent that the only thing he earned was an unending wealth of experiences.
These experiences come at a high cost. He loses, as a result - one who was possibly his true love, a couple of chances at good employment and of course the chance of higher education  which to the average Sri Lankan meant State University entrance, till very recently. In a certain dialogue, Ravindu states that the joy of vagrancy has as its downside a certain loss and the nostalgia of that loss. The joy of association of many is coupled with the loss of someone much closer. The one who wants to treat the sky above as his roof loses the comfort of his own dwelling, yet one who prefers the security of his own roof has to forget the wonder of the sky above. He confesses that hitherto he has not been able to find the middle ground of these two positions.
I do not know which part of this story is influenced by the authors own life, but the reader cannot be faulted if he/she feels that a fair portion is. The narration weighs the pros and cons of total personal liberty. It elaborates on how one would not make a certain level of sacrifice for another, if he or she does not have an expectation that the other person too would reserve some part of his or her life, towards him or her. Essentially, limiting love and passion to one person is a transaction. The moment passion crosses its artificial border, the scale loses balance.
A reason I attached myself to this novel is that this is a novel of our times. We are possibly the last generation who had to write letters to those who won our hearts back then as young adults. A friends sister acting as the post(wo)man was not uncommon. Ravindu here too faces the same dilemma. His unexpressed love finally finds an opening after twenty-three years, thanks to Zuckerberg  for he made a channel for communicating with those, at a distance. Today, the middlemen and the prying public is no longer a worry as the concerned parties get the chance to interact directly. Isuru Prasanga has essentially captured these changes that we lived through over the last 25-30 years.

Essentially, limiting love and passion to one person is a transaction. The moment passion crosses its artificial border, the scale loses balance.

Wandering  The Nation that strayed:
While Ravindu experienced changes in the world over the last thirty years, the other side of this novel is the realpolitik that we as a nation experienced. Ravindu, as well as his best friend Sudheera, were closely attached to the JVP from their schooling days, having attended the famous five classes or the Panthi Paha.
While Sudheera becomes a strong activist of the JVP aligned student union of the Peradeniya University, Ravindu being the non-committed type was not even an official member of the party, being active only at the periphery. Ravindus wandering nature comes up in other areas too as he is not able to enter University, never sticks to a steady job, and prefers a kind of bohemian life.
Sudheera soon after joining Peradeniya, opens up about the true nature of the University from inside and about the draconian control the students union has. He compares it to a Taliban camp, instilling fear in the students against even uttering a word. He is surprised that there are daily meetings to discuss the most trivial of matters, which end in disagreement. Sudheera finds it difficult to accept that Peradeniya is not the sacred temple of Socialism that he dreamt it was. Later Sudheera decides to dedicate his whole University life to politics, ending up a dropout and later becoming part of an extremist alternate breakaway group with a separatist agenda, as the JVP goes into an internal crisis. Sudheeras drunken lamentation on pages 258-259, on what he lost, about the failure of University politics in gaining any tangible results  whether it was an attempt to change the savage culture in the University, matters of University Education or the making of a man who thinks objectively and critically, is definitely good reading for those who bring our universities tothis state.
JVPs internal conflict coincides with the last decisive stages of our war effort against terrorism. An ex-JVP politician shares an important insight with Ravindu. The essence of that insight is that it was the tough man with a big heart who gave the much needed political leadership to fight terrorism as he did not care nor understand the international political implications to its full effect, and that helped. Given the situation, this was the best thing that could happen at the time. A more educated or knowledgeable leader, say a Sorbonne educated one, for example, would have backtracked. Honestly, round about here a subtle fear crept into me, as the book was halfway through, whether the novel was now going to change track and become political propaganda. But I had underestimated the author. The author hides nothing as his sharp criticisms then target the post-war political establishment, including the politician who shared the above political insight. Incidents that portrayed the degeneration of the establishment  Samurdhi officers who tied themselves to trees, teachers who knelt down in front of MPs, canines who travelled from Switzerland in chartered flights. He then concludes that the Leader who defeated the worlds most ruthless terrorist organization, was not capable of controlling his domestic animals, who brought him ruination, and a tale like that beats all the magical realism in modern novels. The country was experiencing a new kind of realism, as Gabriel Garcia Marquez stated, were fortunate sons used soldiers to realise their fetishes such as car races, making the army hate them as they lifted sandbags, to do their bidding. The parts which ran with the above descriptions, our recent past, proved that the author had no aim of being a propagandist. No political party or side is spared, with mismanagement and incompetence of the current lot included.

The essence of that insight is that it was the tough man with a big heart who gave the much needed political leadership to fight terrorism as he did not care nor understand the international political implications to its full effect, and that helped. Given the situation, this was the best thing that could happen at the time

The Lighter side
The book is not without its lighter moments including an episode in which our narrator gets an ear load trying to win the favour of a harlot, who had sometime back taught him the finer points of lovemaking. Even the episode, through which he loses his true love is not without comedy, as it was due to a careless drunken boast.

Short-Term Heroes
Page 368 elaborates a pertinent observation. Through our lives, we experience the falling from grace of many a role model or a hero. It is just a matter of time, experience and knowledge till even great men like Che, Gandhi and Lenin appear in their true size. It is an acknowledged state of the world, we live in  especially the fast-changing times we live in.
This book doesnt depend on experiments in form or a poetic language to give it additional value. The language is apt for the times it relates, with a few uses of undignified vocabulary to add spice and a sense of naturalness. Its an account of our times, told as if he lived it by a fictional narrator, through the travails, hopelessness and the rare moment of celebration. The worst criticism that one could make would be that the book could be edited out by another fifty pages  but that too may harm the wandering nature and the nuances it carries. It was a book that I read with such relish, convinced that it would have been such a shame had I skipped it.

IF WE ARE INTENT ON CHANGING A GRUESOME SYSTEM, WE NEED TO FIRST REALIZE THAT IT IS GRUESOME



Politicians have got used to using the public as if they own them
	Politicians treat the public as trash
	They live by it sometimes they die by it

The most dangerous man to any Government is the man who is able to think things out... without regard to the prevailing superstitions and taboos. Almost inevitably he comes to the conclusion that the Government he lives under is dishonest, insane, intolerable. ~H. L. Mencken
Politicians have got used to using the public as if they own them. At the same time and in the same vein, the public also responds in a welcoming manner that beguiles a probing mind.
The response from the public to the timely use of rhetoric and sloganeering from politicians is being noted not only in the dirty and nauseatingly stinking slums in the urban and suburban sectors, but it is also palpably present in the cocktail circuits in the more sophisticated corners.
Addressing the not-so-wealthy guys and gals in an exaggeratingly approachable way (Either Malli or Nangi depending on gender) does not speak to the character of the politician in question.
Ever since the entry of the common man into the arena of governance, this bastardization of our societal ranks has been able to fundamentally dictate the behaviour and terms of our political dynamics; it has eaten into our fabric of movement without any checks and balances; it has been woven into the very vernacular of the politicians daily tapestry of work.
But tragedy struck without our being aware of it. Its multi-faceted character is raising its very posture beyond all expectations; that despicable human quality of complacency has made the ordinary commoner into a robot to be manipulated by even more despicable politicians.
This is the sad story of our life in Sri Lanka. The common mans politics has created a very uncommon man in the end.
Its evident in every corner of the country; whether in the instance in which the entry of his son or daughter into a respectable school; or on the occasion of a graduate teachers transfer from one school to another; or when the permit for a felling of a tree in his own backyard or in the case of a meagre job of a driver in a Government department, the same ugly beast of bribery and corruption is threatening to devour the common man.
Politicians did not begin their journey to this abyss of bribery and corruption with the entry of the common man, but his entry did cause the journey to be accelerated and much more wicked and unpleasant.
The consequences of change into this novel phase of social evolution are being manifest now in exponential sequence.
The appearance of a halt to its relentless trudge is delusional. In the long journey of human endeavour, the history of a nation is too short even to mention as a footnote. Nations come to life with inspirational leadership and ruthless execution of warfare against those who oppose the birth of new nations. Sri Lanka as a new nation came into being in the mid nineteen hundreds.
Yet, long before the seafaring adventurers Portuguese landed on our shores in 1505, Ceylon existed as a Monarch-nation, sometimes divided and sometimes as a single nation-country.
However, Buddhism as a religion was accepted as the leading and most dominant religion our Kings and Queens faithfully followed and made our State as a single Buddhist religious polity, making it look like a Theocracy.
This dependence on a single exclusive religion, Buddhism, and making it the official state religion has caused many a modern day liberal to think that Buddhism, being given exclusive and superior status in the context of constitutional acceptance, is a violation of basic fair play.
And the entry of SWRD Bandaranaikes utterly short-sighted policies of Sinhala-only as the official language of the State has quadrupled the ill-effects of such nihilistic political adventures.
Into this array of political adventures of SWRD enters the common man.
The common man is not condemned because of his socio-economic status. Socio-economic status of man is determined by so many factors amongst which most domineering is the prevailing material conditions in the country at the time.
However, Sri Lanka has been enjoying free education since 1946. This allowed each and every school-going age child to be educated at no cost to the parents of the child and free education, as it was called, did not associate itself with the necessary educational infrastructure. This lack of infrastructure, especially in the rural districts where more than 70% of our population lived, told another story about our free education.
Lack of English teachers in the rural schools made this tale even more mournful. Schools in major city centres such as Colombo, Jaffna, Kandy, and Galle were saturated with top-class English, Mathematics and Science teachers. They enjoyed privileged status with almost all leading schools in the country and were located in those city centres. The resulting discriminatory grading of schools led to these rural schools producing their best children to enter the Universities. But they produced Arts graduates without any knowledge of English and had a marked disadvantage in the employment market. Whereas those who studied in the leading schools in the city centres relished pre-eminence purely because of their ease with which they conversed and managed their day-to-day business of school-going and extra-curricular activities such as cricket, tennis and other sports.
The common mans child did not avail himself or herself of these luxury elements of free education. On the other hand the common mans lethargy and over-dependence on Government handouts so promised and never delivered by the cunning and diabolical politicians paved the way for an utterly disparate system of free education which continued to produce not educated men and women but book-worms whose understanding of the developing marketplace was minimal and was pathetically below expectations.
When SWRDs so-called revolution introduced so many common men and women into politics mainly as a political gundu (bait) and not as a result of a puritanical intention of giving him a place in the sun, the common man took the stick by the wrong end. The House of Parliament used to preside over some of the best oratorical and thoughtful exchange of ideas and ideals.
With the ominous entry of the common man, it instantly transformed itself into a House of irritating and cantankerous men and women of half or uneducated kind.
The common man is not condemned because of his socio-economic status. Nor is he judged for his family background. But his refusal to learn from the prevailing discriminatory systems and introduce meaningful and positive changes into the system is open for criticism and condemnation.
When those who have refused to learn have entered politics for its lure of power and an opportunity to earn money has corrupted the uneducated mind of the common man-politician.
This convoluted context of socio-political reality made the well-intentioned uncommon politician feel bad for doing whats right. Bandaranaikes policies and principles made the countrys common good turn into thorns in the eyes of the public, 80% of whom were common men and women.
Whichever way one looks, its not a good sight. The present-day corruption of all layers of Government, beginning from politician down to Ministry officials, and grama niladharis is a dangerous symptom of that malady.
Politicians of both sides, Government and opposition, have entered politics not for the noble cause of service of man but for self-obsession and material enrichment.
That pathetic characteristic of humanity has devoured our politicians and there doesnt seem to be a way out. They have come to treat the public as trash and their spit on the face of a gullible voter is welcomed with a docile demeanour and complacency.
If we are intent upon changing this gruesome system, we need to first realize that it is gruesome and unwelcome.
Educating the masses towards a more amenable and positive way of socio-political life is difficult and time-consuming. There will never be a perfect society. Such dreams are essentially utopian and far too optimistic. Yet an effort towards improvement of men and women by providing a fundamental structure to enable man to develop himself without the expectation of Government handouts and political patronage and defence of that structure is of utmost significance and dispensation of justice and execution of a work plan that would benefit the public even at the expense of the super-rich class of commission-merchants and politico-dealers is a must in the current context.
Yet, all these measures and dreamlike policies could be blindsided by a single stroke of a politicians pen. Corruption has gone into the marrow of our politicians.
They live by it sometimes they die by it. But the public simply cannot wait any longer without making a hearable noise. The Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) and its able speakers have performed admirably well in the current circumstances but their history is brimming with terror, murder and mayhem.
Anura Kumara Dissanayake and Handunhetti alone cannot do this job and it is essential that they, the JVP, support a common candidate at the next Presidential Elections with the support of all civil societies and the UNP.
The Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) and the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) are beyond repair. They are the ones who are mainly responsible for this mess and their intentions are well recorded in our post-Independence history. Lets leave them there, as an unprintable footnote in history.

Suspect a RAW member bearing ID number RB317217/VJ: JO
	
The Joint Opposition (JO) today said the Indian national, who claimed of a plot to assassinate President Maithripala Sirisena, former President Mahinda Rajapaksa and his family members, was identified as an Indias Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) member bearing the RAW identity card number of RB317217/VJ.
JO member MP Wimal Weerawansa told a news conference that they had investigated on this issue and had found out that the Indian national who was arrested in Sri Lanka was named Rajendra Kumar and he was working for the RAW.
He said the suspect had come to Sri Lanka before the election held in 2015 and had continued working for the RAW during his stay.
The Indian national has tried to meet me in two instances but has failed since I was not available at my residence and office at that time. Right after his arrest, the Indian High Commission announced that the arrested person was psychologically imbalanced. It is the easiest way to tackle such incidents, he said.
Even the RAW is active in Sri Lanka but President Sirisena is still maintaining a silent policy. It is evident that the RAW and the Tamil Diaspora are engaging in some conspiracies in Sri Lanka. The situation has turned quite dangerous, he added. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)

The Books are here: Where are the authors
	

Another chapter of the Colombo International Book Fair has ended, and October, dubbed the month of literature (Sahithya Masaya) is already here. The publishers (the big names at any rate) will have reason to congratulate themselves, as well as the caterers, while the crowds will look forward to next years ambling from stall to stall in between resting their aching feet at the food stalls.
Since October is dedicated to literature, I hope they are busy reading the fiction, non-fiction and the poetry they bought at the book fair. Being optimistic, one could put the figure at seventy per cent. Or bring it down to fifty, which is still an impressive figure. It may actually be thirty, which isnt bad. Anything below that is depressing.
Many people tell me they have no time to read, which is really a damning condemnation of their priorities. No one will tell you that they have little or no money left to buy books for leisure reading, because that would amount to an admission of incipient and incurable poverty. You can blame inflation, economic mismanagement or anything else under the sun for that, but books will not be priorities for many when the going gets hard (and when has the going ever been easy).

You can blame inflation, economic mismanagement or anything else under the sun for that, but books will not be priorities for many when the going gets hard

Development should include art and culture alongside roads and bridges, and its unfortunate when those who can afford private libraries and collections will emphasise road building over a reading culture for the masses. This lop sided development will only make us culturally poorer than ever. There are a few drops in this intellectually murky ocean, such as a revamped Colombo Public Library and even a new library for the Welikada Prison, but the overall picture remains dismal.
A small-scale publisher tells me that its so hard to sell quality fiction or non-fiction. People who win literary awards wont go to someone like him. In any case, the awards are so designed that the author has no choice in the matter and those who award the prize are working with a big name publisher of their choice.
Is the award more important than the author This isnt a fatuous question. When someone wins the Nobel Prize or the Booker, its the writer who is always more important. In our case, one hardly remembers the author after the initial flurry of media coverage. Having attended all but one of the September book tamashas, I try to remember in vain a case of a novelist, poet, or a non-fiction author being spotlighted, with their publishers introducing them to the reading public, with live interviews being aired, and giving them time and space on a regular basis so that people remember them and think of them as important.
We do not care about authors. Writers are having a hard time all over the world. In the West, where writing looks more lucrative because of the best sellers, publishing deals and contracts, many writers are suffering economically and the reason given by all major publishers is Amazon.com. What they dont tell you is that none of them plan to close the shop and invest in something more lucrative (such as Amazon.com). Book publishing still pays, as it always has. French author Simone de Beauvoir, writing about her publisher Gallimard many years ago, said monsieur Gallimard gave more and more lavish parties each year, and all the writers were invited. But their incomes remain the same while Gallimard keeps getting rich. What she said in a letter to her lover, American novelist Nelson Alagren, was a universal truth.
I dont know if our book publishers give parties. Perhaps, the September book fair is their party, though we have to buy tickets and refreshments. But it isnt just the publishers who are at fault. Books arent meant to be just read and thrown away. Only a few will stand the test of time and become the kind of text loved by publishers who make money by re-printing them as classics. But millions more are preserved in relative obscurity in libraries, archives and private collections, and they have stories and information of much value. As such, they arent entirely forgotten. To each book which lives (in publishers dreams), there are thousands of dead books lovingly looked after by someone, somewhere.
What about the people who write them Take it from me, writing is one of the most thankless jobs around, and writing novels or books running into hundreds of pages is hard labour. Its a lonely job, too. Once its done, just try finding someone reliable to proofread or give an opinion. Its such a thankless task, and only a few ever get rewarded enough in terms of money. Some get rewarded very well, even outrageously. Like everything else in life, rewards for writing books too, are unfair. Many work at it, without ever getting the financial breaks and the recognition they deserve, while others write voluminous potboilers and get into the best seller lists (at least in the West).

Is the award more important than the author This isnt a fatuous question. When someone wins the Nobel Prize or the Booker, its the writer who is always more important

Over here, writers generally hope for recognition, not money. Thats where the awards business comes in, but thats like the lottery. What happens to those who dont win them and even to those winners in subsequent years Those who have what it takes to stick through monumental pain and despair to go on writing book after book, year after year, deserve respect, whether they win awards or not. They deserve to be remembered. They do it for the sheer love of writing, nothing more. But do we remember them
In this country, the homes of authors Martin Wickremasinghe, W.A. Silva and K. Jayathilake are preserved (in Koggala, Wellawatte and Kannimahara respectively). These were men of some means and unusual determination and perseverance. But what happened to the others Going back in time, we can start with Piyadasa Sirisena, Munidasa Kumaratunge, P.B. Alwis Perera, Sagara Palansuriya (Kayes), G.B. Senanayake, T.B. Ilangaratne, Mahagama Sekara, Karunasena Jayalath, Monica Ruwan Pathirana and many more. I dont want to leave out Deeman Ananda, because pulp fiction too is a literary genre and he has no successor who can write like him.
Where did these writers live Did they own their own homes or live in rented houses Where they sheltered and worked, finding inspiration to write despite all that life threw at them, is worthy of preserving. Poet and novelist Mahagama Sekara owned his own house, in the same village as author K. Jayathilake. It was sold by his descendants about a decade ago. No one can blame them for that decision. Preservation of such historic places must come from societies. In government as well as the world of business, there must be people who read the works of these writers and poets, and found inspiration. The impetus for preservation of that heritage must come from them.


To take an example from cinema, since such heritage isnt limited to literature, take the case of Dr. Lester James Pieris and his wife Sumithra. They lived in a rented house off Dickmans Road for several decades, and the situation finally became untenable due to inflation and rising real estate prices. That is where a fund must take over to compensate the owner, restore the premises and open it to the public as an archives and museum.
It isnt just homes that need to be preserved. In K. Jayathilakes ancestral home, now a library and museum, on display are many manuscripts of various authors collected by him over the years. That indefatigable and scholarly monk brought out the nine-volume Sinhala Puwathpath Sangara Ithihasaya in the 1960s. He even collected the signatures of prominent writers and editors and left for us an invaluable heritage.
But the rest are mostly horror stories of neglect and oblivion. An acquaintance told me that someone discovered the poetry manuscripts of Monica Ruwan Pathirana in a gram sellers cart after her death. If that person had the wits to buy them from the gram seller, where are they now What do we know about one of the most influential Sinhala poets of our times (Ive been trying to piece together biographical information about Lakdasa Wickremasinghe, called the most radical of our poets in English, but Ill leave English writing out of this discussion. You cant even a find his photograph).
I was told that the house, national hero Puran Appu lived in existed somewhere in Moratuwa till the 1970s, very much as it had been a century ago. But it was bought by a businessman and demolished. Not even a photograph of it exists now. If thats what happens to the legacy of national heroes, celebrated in movies and even stamps, what can you say about writers

Over here, writers generally hope for recognition, not money. Thats where the awards business comes in, but thats like the lottery

The book fair can raise public awareness on the need for such conservation. It can help launch a fund too, with part of the income from ticket sales, for example. The major publishers can get together and invite authors, contemporary as well as those now living in obscurity, to meet the public, with panel discussions on their lives and work. The works of those who are no longer living too can be discussed. The public can be asked to join in a literary quiz. Our insane television is direly in need of a channel giving time to the arts, modeled along BBC lines. Dont tell me the money isnt there  why do we always have to be so poor when it comes to culture
There are many ways to promote literature. The idea that literature is much more than each years award winning books, and that people who write books too, are as important, needs to be promoted.
Itd be interesting to see how the heritage of authors is being cared for in other counties, and well do in another article before long.

TODAYS REALITIES
	

What are todays Realities
GRIM!!! Lots of Humans, Less Humanity, More Degrees, Less Common Sense, Lots of Facebook Friends, No Best Friends, Big Houses, Small Families, High Income, Less Peace of Mind, Designer Watches, No Time, High IQs, No Emotions, Advanced Medicine, Poor Health, Gone to the Moon, Neighbours Unknown, Numerous Affairs, No True Love!!! These are the STARK REALITIES BUT THERE IS MORE!!! No Ethics, No Generosity, No Feeling for the Underprivileged, No Social Etiquette, No Table Etiquette, No Manners, No Morals, No Family Love, No Filial Love, No Conjugal Love, No Parental Love, No Kindness, No Friendships, No Camaraderie, No Religion, NOTHING THAT MATTERS AT ALL!!!


Family that eats together
Gone are the days when families sat around their tables, gave thanks for their meals and enjoyed so much good fun, telling stories with children doing most of the talking and the grown-ups listening!!! The good old days when, people dressed for important events, the tables were meticulously laid with beautiful table mats, shining silver, gleaming glassware, floral table centres, napkins daintily folded or made into different designs, everything done with attention to detail!!! Now, the grown-ups eat when they want to, the kids dash in and grab some food to stuff their mouths with and are out again, no time, no time, no time for anything except dashing around wanting to see the next TV drama, catch the news, play cricket or whatever is on the scene!!! In the past, if you tried getting into a 5 Star Hotel in rubber slippers and shorts, you would get no further than the door!!! Today, anyone can go in shorts and slippers and even partake of a meal!!! Is it that standards have deteriorated so badly or the bottom line is, the more people allowed, the more money the hotel makes



We got the power
You only have to open a newspaper or listen to the news to realize the enormity of natural disasters occurring around the world today!!! Floods, hurricanes, storms, earthquakes, fires, on a daily basis!!! It seems as though God is angry with the world but what intrigues and worries are the irreverent attitudes  it is a blatant WE DONT CARE, WE HAVE MONEY, WE HAVE POWER, WE CAN DO ANYTHING WE WANT!!! IT MATTERS NOT THAT THE MONEY IS FROM ILL-GOTTEN GAINS, MONEY OBTAINED FROM DRUGS WHICH IS ANOTHER EVER PRESENT SCOURGE TODAY, MONEY IS ALL POWERFUL SO WHO NEEDS RELIGION, WHO NEEDS GOD TESTIMONY OF FOOLS!!!



What goes around comes around
If we want to live a life worthwhile, perhaps it would be useful to ponder on the little things to remember in Life:
The past cannot be changed
Opinions dont define your reality
Everyones journey is different
Things get better with time
Positive thoughts create positive things
You fail only if you quit
Over-thinking will lead to sadness
What goes around comes around
Judgments are a confession of character
Happiness is found within
Kindness is free
Smiles are contagious



Bringem back
		
		Eventually, we find that Passports have been impounded at the request of the CID and wonder why this could not have been done earlier in so many instances where people have got away!!! DIG Nalaka de Silva and Namal Kumara though not named as suspects have been grounded, but the real suspects like Jaliya, Mahendran, and other suspects have been allowed to go scot-free with absolutely no idea of whether they will return or not!!! Arjun Aloysius and Palisena are still whiling away in prison!!! The million dollar question is why NOTHING AND WE MEAN NOTHING is being done to bring Mahendran and Jaliya back WHO OR WHAT ARE WE AFRAID OF IT SURELY HAS TO BE SOMETHING CATASTROPHIC TO MERIT SUCH SILENCE!!! THE SOUND OF SILENCE IS OMINOUS!!! Why is nothing being said or done about Mahendran and Jaliya, Thajudeens murder, Lasanthas murder, they are conveniently maintaining a stubborn silence on these matters when they should be moving heaven and earth to bring these culprits to book



Pick pocketing
Apparently, pick-pocketing in buses is still rampant!!! The most horrifying part of it is that in some buses, the conductor warns you to be careful because he has seen the man boarding the bus!!! The poor passenger who is robbed is totally unaware as most of them are so exhausted after a long days work!!! It is only later that the horrifying reality dawns!!! It should be mandatory for the conductor to report such a person to the nearest Police Station!!!

Youtube suffers outage for over 30 minutes
	
YouTube experienced widespread broadcasting issues, affecting YouTube, YouTube TV and YouTube Music, with the Google-owned streaming service down for almost two hours.
YouTube said it was looking into reports of issues with its services, as users contacted them complaining about the website being down from about 1.30am GMT.
Some users trying to access the YouTube homepage received an error message appearing saying: Sorry, something went wrong. A team of highly trained monkeys has been dispatched to deal with this situation. Other attempts led to the homepage opening but no video content being displayed.
YouTube responded to questions about the system breakdown by directing the Guardian to a tweet posted on the YouTube homepage. Thanks for your reports about YouTube, YouTube TV and YouTube Music access issues. Were working on resolving this and will let you know once fixed. We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and will keep you updated. (The Guardian)
