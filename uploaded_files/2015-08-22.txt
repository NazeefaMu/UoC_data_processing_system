Sobitha Thera slams appointment of defeated candidates to national list
	
While stating that it was wrong to appoint defeated candidates to the national list, leader of the National Movement for Social Justice (NMSJ) Ven. Maduluwawe Sobitha Thera said yesterday the only solution to prevent such moves was to enact a new constitution.
Ven. Sobitha Thera said the current constitution allowed for defeated candidates to enter parliament through the national list, and added that such loopholes should be amended and a new constitution introduced.
?It is wrong to appoint defeated candidates to the national list. Our constitution is full of shortcomings. We need a new constitution without shortcomings like the preferential voting system,? he said.
The Thera said the UNP had taken a policy decision not to appoint defeated candidates to the national list.
