Anunayake Thera is against opening of road opposite Dalada Maligawa
	
Anunayake of the Malwatte Chapter Ven Dr. Niyangoda Sri Vijithasiri Thera said it was malicious for anyone to request for the opening of the road in front of Sri Dalada Maligawa on the assumption that it would ease traffic congestion.
He was addressing the media on the current issue related to this. He said air pollution and traffic congestion are problems afflicted not only in the city of Kandy but in other cities like Colombo, Kurunegala, Galle, Matara and Matale. The Venerable Thera said that the traffic problem has emerged due to the non-availability of an alternate route.
He said the proposal to build a flyover near the Mahamaya Balika Vidyalaya was a sound proposal and delay in implementing it is also a concern for the public.
"Those who claim that the closure of this road is creating this traffic congestion should realize that in the Kandy town there is a massive air pollution that is taking place due to the traffic congestions and the emission of air from these vehicles. No investigations had been carried out in a broader manner regarding this," he said. (J. A. L. Jayasinghe)

Bid to convert SriLankan Airlines into a PPP:  Govt. looking for another partner
	
The Government has decided to look for another partner for the national carrier Srilankan Airlines in addition to the short listed Texas Pacific Group (TPG) in its bid to convert the venture into a public-private partnership, Minister of Public Enterprise Development Kabir Hashim said yesterday.
Minister Hashim told a media briefing that TPG was selected out of about 14 applications received when the government called for expressions of interest but the government has begun discussions with several airlines as well.
He said the committee appointed for the restructure of the airline is currently having discussions with several airlines. The committee comprises secretary of his ministry, secretaries of three other ministries and representatives of the company that had been hired as an advisor.
This discussion he said has begun in line with the government?s thinking that involvement of airline is needed when it comes to restructuring of the national carrier.
He said TPG is currently carrying out a study on Srilankan Airlines. ?TPG can look at the financial statements of the airline in carrying out the evaluation,? he said.
Meanwhile, the Minister said the decision on the lease of three A330-200 aircraft which has expired recently is still pending. ?We are yet to make the final decision on these aircraft as the directors of Srilankan Airlines want the lease extended,? the Minister said.(Yohan Perera)

British police  found no evidence the London attack was linked to the IS
	
?
No matter the jihadists? claiming of responsibility online for the brazen assault on Parliament that killed four people. 52-year-old Khalid Masood ?clearly had an interest in jihad,? said Neil Basu, deputy assistant commissioner of London?s Metropolitan Police, but there was no indication that he had discussed or coordinated his plans?with others. ??
?His methods appear to be based on low-sophistication, low-tech, low-cost techniques copied from other attacks and echo the rhetoric of [Islamic State] leaders in terms of methodology,? said Basu, who added: ?I know when, where and how Masood committed his atrocities, but now I need to know why.? ??
When news broke of the devastating terrorist attack in London last Wednesday, many people in the English city of Birmingham hoped the trail wouldn?t lead to their city. But the next morning, as helicopters circled over Birmingham, residents there immediately suspected the reason: It was a former Birmingham resident who had committed the attack. ??
In the days since, there has been a sharp rise in hate emails and threats against Birmingham?s central mosque. The tensions threaten to undo years of progress that have put the city at the forefront of British counterextremism efforts. ??
Birmingham has long fought its image as a ?hotbed of terrorism.? Khalid Masood, the perpetrator of the London attack, was only one of many violent extremists connected to the city. There, some of Britain?s most deprived Muslim citizens ? who make up more than 20 percent of the city?s population ? live in districts where poverty, crime and unemployment have played into the hands of radicals for decades. ??
Relations between the police and Birmingham mosques have significantly improved since 2014, when parents started to fear their children might leave the city and join the Islamic State. ?The collaboration between authorities and the local community has so far worked better in Birmingham than on a national level,? said Chris Allen, a sociologist at the University of Birmingham. ??
That hasn?t always been the case. In 2010, authorities installed surveillance cameras across Birmingham to monitor the movements of Muslims suspected of terrorism ? placing all Muslims under universal suspicion, critics argued at the time. The project was stopped, but not before it severely damaged relations between Muslim leaders and government officials. ?You cannot fight extremism by putting a community with its back against the wall,? said 38-year-old Hamayoon Sultan, who attends prayer at the central mosque. ??
Now Masood?s attack threatens to bring back the cloud of suspicion. Birmingham?s Muslims have held moments of silence, vigils and marches, denouncing the incident as anti-Islamic. But the shows of unity cannot hide the anxiety of many Muslims in the city. They worry there will be a backlash against their community in the?
coming weeks. ??
Even as he attended one such vigil on Friday, 43-year-old Mohammed Elmokhtar expressed his pessimism: ?I?ve always feared the day Britain would be struck by a major terrorist attack again.? ? Rick Noack?

The government is to withhold the proposed Cabinet reshuffle till the Sinhala New Year period is over, it is learnt.
Though the Sri Lanka Freedom Party headed by President Maithripala Sirisena is eager to have a shuffle, it is learnt that the United National Party(UNP) is not in favour.
According to UNP sources, the party holds the view that Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake is not solely responsible for the present economic woos of the country and that his removal in a Cabinet reshuffle is not the solution at hand .
Also, the UNP believes that it is too early for a Cabinet reshuffle.(Kelum Bandara)

?
Ceylinco Life has commenced construction of a new eco-friendly building to house its branch in Chilaw, continuing efforts to reduce the company?s carbon footprint.
The formal laying of the foundation stone for the two-storey, 6,000 square-foot building took place recently at No: 90 A, Kurunegala Road, Chilaw, on land owned by the life insurance leader.
The new building is designed for optimal use of natural light and will be entirely solar powered. It will also be equipped with the latest energy-efficient lighting and air conditioning systems will have a facility for rainwater harvesting and its own car park.

Additionally, Ceylinco Life?s head office building at Havelock Road, Colombo 5 has its own solar electricity system, which generates 63.18kW of electricity and is one of the largest of its kind in the city.
The company operates the largest network of 250 plus branches in Sri Lanka?s life insurance industry, giving it a physical presence in 142 cities, towns and villages in every one of the island?s 25 districts.
The market leader in Sri Lanka?s life insurance sector since 2004, Ceylinco Life has close to a million lives covered by active policies. The company is acknowledged as the benchmark for innovation in the local insurance industry for its work in product research and development, customer service, professional development and corporate social responsibility.

Coping with  Postpartum Depression
	
?
?
A baby is a bundle of joy for all mothers and will be loved and cherished by everyone. Nevertheless, with the onset of parenthood, some mothers are prone to go through an ordeal of stress, anxiety and exhaustion that leaves them depressed, with feelings of being let down in life. Known as a depressive disorder, Postpartum Depression is a severe form of mental illness that reflects characteristics such as low energy levels, depressive mood levels and in severe cases, even suicidal tendencies in most mothers following childbirth. ??
Although not true in all cases, many mothers experience either baby blues or its severe counterpart, Postpartum Depression, which ensues a few days after delivering the baby. According to the World Health Organization, nearly ten percent of pregnant women and thirteen percent of women who have just delivered a baby experience a mental disorder in the form of depression, globally. WHO also notes that the rate of women experiencing depression is even higher in developing countries, with statistics indicating a 15% increase in women during pregnancy and a 19.8% increase in women following childbirth. ??
While in most cases first time mothers may experience symptoms of a depressive disorder, it should also be noted that this could have a negative impact on the health of the baby as well, in terms of growth and development. Speaking to Health Capsule, Senior Registrar in Psychiatry at the National Hospital of Sri Lanka, Dr. Suhashini Ratnatunga explained how Postpartum Depression could have an adverse effect on the health of the mother and child, while further elucidating the symptoms, risk factors and treatment options available for the illness. She emphasized that maternal mental disorders such as Postpartum Depression were treatable with proper and timely intervention and that it was crucial to raise ample awareness among mothers on how best to cope with Postpartum Depression. Excerpts of the interview are given below. ?
?
QCan you define Postpartum Depression?
Postpartum Depression is a depressive disorder that takes place during the post-partum period. A depressive disorder is characterized by persistent low mood, low energy levels, anhedonia, poor sleep and appetite. ?
?
QIs it a condition that affects both sexes, or is it a mental condition that affects only women?
Depressive disorders affect both sexes; however post-partum depression is a special kind of depression only women experience following childbirth. ?
?
QWhat causes Postpartum Depression in an individual?
Clinical observation suggests that these disorders are precipitated in vulnerable mothers by the psychological adjustment required after childbirth, as well as by the loss of sleep and hard work involved in caring for the baby. The main risk factors are a previous history of depression and indications of social adversity. ?
?
QWhat are the symptoms related to Postpartum Depression?
Symptoms related to Postpartum Depression may include irritability, anxiety, anhedonia, persistent low mood, poor sleep and lack of appetite. Patients may also experience low energy levels and poor cognitive ability. ??
?
QHow is this condition diagnosed and how early should it be diagnosed in the patient?
The condition is diagnosed by looking for the above mentioned symptoms in all mothers following childbirth. ?
?
QWhat kind of treatment is administered to patients with Postpartum Depression?
Psychological support and pharmacological treatment such as antidepressants, anxiolytics and in severe cases, electro-convulsive therapy are administered to patients suffering from this. ?
?
QIs it a condition that affects young women who have attained motherhood for the first time or could it occur in any mother regardless of age?
It can affect any woman regardless of age, especially if they have risk factors such as depression or indications of social adversity. ?
?
QHow common is Postpartum Depression in Sri Lanka?
There are no figures for Sri Lanka. However, in the context of Sri Lanka, 1/7 of women could be a reasonable estimate for having Postpartum Depression. ?
?
QWhat are the negative health consequences of living with Postpartum Depression and not getting treatment?
Psychological and physical deterioration in the mother with drastic consequences, leading even to suicide is possible if treatment is not taken into serious account. Neglect of the baby leading to improper bonding and physical health consequences are also possibilities. ?
?
?
QCould parents suffering from Postpartum Depression have a negative effect on their baby?s well-being?
Yes, improper attachment and emotional disturbances such as irritability may occur, and have a negative effect on the baby if the mother is suffering from Postpartum Depression. ?
?
QIs Postpartum Depression preventable?
If detected early, the illness can be treated effectively. Identifying high-risk mothers and monitoring them closely for symptoms is another strategy that we employ. ?
?
QWhat are the screening opportunities available in Sri Lanka for Postpartum Depression?
All mothers attending specialized maternal MOH clinics are given a self-administered questionnaire known as the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale. This has a high specificity and sensitivity when detecting postpartum depression. ?
?
QOverall, what general advice would you give to those suffering from Postpartum Depression?
Seek treatment early, understand it is not a weakness in your personality but due to a biological change in your body. Keep close contact with your doctor and discuss your concerns. ?

First-ever  Pacific Partnership mission in Sri Lanka
	
?
Having assisted the health officer of the Hambantota ?District Hospital to deliver a healthy baby girl, Patricia Kemp, Lt. Commander of the Australian Navy and nurse practitioner and midwife of the Pacific Partnership, said the emotional experience was one of a kind and that she was glad to have assisted in the delivery of a Sri Lankan citizen.?
Daily Mirror had the opportunity to talk to Commander Kemp who arrived in Sri ?Lanka along with a group of medical practitioners on March 7. It was her maiden Pacific Partnership mission.?
?It was such an emotional experience,? said an overwhelmed Kemp while wiping away her tears of joy.?
?The health services in Sri ?Lanka are very much on par with those in my country. The local nurse practitioners are equipped with vast experience. There was a Sri Lankan lady who had assisted in delivering 10,000 babies,? she said.?
The team conducted a number of health campaigns, training sessions and medical expertise exchange programmes with local medical experts at the hospital. Not only did the visiting team engage in these activities, they also treated hospitalized patients.?
Medical providers including ophthalmologists, audiologists, cardiologists, neonatologists and orthopaedic surgeons from the US, Australia and Japan came together in the medical camp.?
?This campaign could be considered a disaster simulation process where we had to prepare ourselves to arrive at the best medical solution depending on the scenario. This training enabled us to step forward fearlessly and to make use of our expertise,? one of the medical practitioners said.?
Apart from the medical exchange, one of the major events at the health camp was a Tsunami drill held to train the participants on how to face such a situation,? Hospital Director Dr. Sumith Manathunga told Daily Mirror.?
?We were unable to effectively utilize the aid received during the Tsunami tragedy as there was no proper mechanism. The visiting medical experts have disaster readiness experience gained from different parts of the world, which greatly helped us. ?
?Medical experts from four countries attended the health camp. They had the opportunity to study the Sri Lankan health system. Local consultants including neurologists, endocrinologists, nurses, cardiologists and orthopaedic surgeons partnered with foreign counterparts. While some of them worked in the eye-clinic, some others delivered lectures on training nurses.?
?Apart from medical doctors, other staff categories such as nurses rarely get overseas training. But this camp provided them the opportunity to enhance their experiences with medical experts from different countries,? Dr. Manathunga said.?
The Tsunami drill was held in USNS Fall River, the expeditionary fast transport ship of the US Navy that arrived at the Hambantota ?Port on March 7 for the fortnight multinational humanitarian assistance and disaster relief preparedness mission of the Pacific Partnership.?
The ship made out of aluminum to maintain its speed has a permanent crew of 24 hosts. However, during the Hambantota mission, there were at least 200 personnel.
In another session, US marines provided training to Sri Lankan Navy and Air Force personnel on water purification at the premises of the Hambantota ?Port.?
US Staff Sergeant Devario Graham, a Water Support Chief, who led the training session of Sri Lankan marines, said in case of a disaster, they could come forward and help local marines in providing aid.?
?We want to be partners and we want to help. Having shared our know-how, Sri ?Lanka can be prepared for providing clean water to disaster victims using a reverse osmosis water purification unit,? he told Daily Mirror.?
The filters of the reverse osmosis water purification unit have a life span of five years while the unit is self-sustained. It had been added to Pacific Partnership in 2004, and henceforth provided drinking water to disaster victims in a number of countries.?
The US Staff Sergeant said there were different aspects that needed consideration when using the unit; a site clear for transport, a 60kw-generator to power the unit and access to any type of water. He said the unit filtered 4,557 litres of seawater and 5,557 litres of contaminated water per hour.?
?Since no human could live for more than three days without drinking water, this is a really good tool for life sustenance during disastrous situations. Contaminated water including sewerage and sea water are being pumped into a potable water tank first. Then, as water enters the purification unit, all dirt and micro organisms get filtered. Later, it goes through the reverse osmosis membrane purifying filtered water,? he said. ?
Graham further stated that after the reverse osmosis process, a device was being used to test the quality of water. Once chlorine was added, the Total Dissolved Solid (TDS), PH and chlorine levels would be checked, he said. ?
?Chlorine is being added to terminate the growth of bacteria in water. Sodium bisulphite is added after chlorination to reduce any remaining chlorine before releasing water for drinking purposes. Filtered and purified water is sent to another potable tank from which people can store water. At the Hambantota ?Port, we were given the opportunity to taste filtered and purified seawater. Though I had a sip with uncertainty, to my surprise, purified seawater was not salty.?
Graham said they wanted to train Sri Lankan marines on how to use the water purification unit and on how to set it up at a time of a natural disaster.?
The Pacific Partnership?s humanitarian assistance and disaster relief preparedness mission in Sri Lanka was concluded on March 17. Their next destinations are Myanmar, Malaysia and Vietnam.?

Gota no threat to MS, says Isura Devapriya
	
Former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa could not pose a threat to President Maitripala Sirisena as a next Presidential Candidate because he could not attract votes from the north and the east as seen crucial for the final outcome at the last election, Western Province Chief Minister Isuru Devapriya said today.
Mr. Devapriya, handpicked by President Sirisena for the Chief Minister post, said Gothabaya Rajapaksa was only a military officer and not a seasoned politician like President Sirisena.
?Candidate of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) for next Presidential Election should be a person, who can attract each and every citizen in the country,? he said.
He said that the southern people?s votes were divided at the last Presidential Election.
?Therefore a candidate should be able to gather the support of all ethnic and religious groups to win the Presidential Election,? he said.
The Chief Minister said President Sirisena was an asset to the SLFP and would be the candidate for the 2020 Presidential Election.
He also said the other parties already faced difficulties finding a candidate for their parties and making baseless statements.
Meantime, Mr. Devapriya said SLFP had done its part in the Unity Government however; UNP was pulling back in some cases as they had changed their stance, especially in decisions such as Cabinet portfolios.
He said that whatever happened, President Sirisena or the SLFP had not changed their views on the country?s issues.
He said the SLFP would drive the country on the correct path regardless of the consent of the UNP. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

H?tota Port deal: JO mulling withdrawal from oversight committee
	
The Joint Opposition (JO) today said there was no point in continuing to represent the oversight committee on Hambantota Port agreement if the government has already made up its mind over the agreement.
JO National Organiser MP Dullas Alahapperuma said it seems the government was bypassing Parliament to close the port agreement.
?This is what the government did in 2001 when entering into an agreement with the LTTE. They didn?t seek Parliament consent. Today, the United National Party (UNP) says Cabinet approval has been granted to the deal whereas the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) says no approval had been granted so far,? he told a news briefing.
He said not even a draft of the port agreement had been submitted to the Parliament oversight committee appointed to look into the port deal so far.
The MP said they would make a decision about their representation in oversight committees following a discussion if government continues to sideline these committees when making decisions. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

He leaves the country after Third Umpire?s ruling
	
?
A rumour swirling in political circles these days says that the present holder of the key portfolio related to marine traffic is to be moved out at the top team reshuffle in the offing.
?
Gampaha?s loss is going to be Hambantota?s gain, they say.
The rumour had sent the incumbent into a flutter. He had lost no time in making an appeal to the ?umpire? that he be allowed to bat on undisturbed. As there was no positive response, he had made an appeal to the Third Umpire, his mentor hailing from the same district.
The response from the Third Umpire had been not only negative, but brusque as well. ?That is one of the subjects assigned to the Green party. Let them take any decision they please,? she had said putting her foot down. Finding no solace coming forth from any quarter, the highly dejected purohita had later left the country on a long holiday with his sibling in tow, they say.?

He picks another confidant for the tough job

The Green leader?s confidant from Matara currently handling foreign matters is strongly tipped to take over the public purse shortly, they say.
?
Many purohitas, Diyawanna members and well-wishers who attended a commemorative pinkama held at his residence the other day had showered him with warm greetings when he admitted that that he had already been offered the challenging job. ?He had also emphasized that he agreed to accept the new job as Number Two pressed him, but on his own terms.
One of the conditions he stipulated was that the austere and soft-spoken ex-banker now playing deputy elsewhere be allowed to share his new subject as the State purohita, sources say.
? ?
Meanwhile, the once Green -now turned- Blue politico from Matara already playing second fiddle to the current holder of the public purse is to be raised to the top team status, they say.

I am unable to protect those found guilty of killing media persons or sportsmen: MS
	
President Maithripala Sirisena said today he was unable to protect those who are found guilty of acts that are not connected to the national security and those who are guilty of killing media persons or sportsmen.
He emphasized that he would always take the fullest responsibility on behalf of any problem face by the officers, staff members and war heroes who fought against the LTTE.
The President, pointing out that it was the responsibility and duty of the government to protect the war heroes who fought for the Motherland, assured that he would always fulfill his responsibility as the President and Defence Minister.
He said that he was not prepared to make any war hero a suspect in the charges leveled against the armed forces and the government on the alleged violations of human rights during the war against terrorism.
While there is an unprecedented goodwill for Sri Lanka among the international community today and many people question as to what benefit could be derived to the country from this, President Sirisena said. ?We are utilizing that goodwill and friendship for the protection of the honour and respect of our war heroes,? he said. He added that the most powerful world leaders have assured him that they would stand by Sri Lanka?s independence and democracy as well as on issues pertaining to the members of armed forces.
He made this statement at the opening of the newly constructed three-storeyed building at the Defence Services School in Kurunegala.

In Russia, a protest that can?t be killed
	
?
(c) 2017, The Washington Post ? ??
On Monday, March 20, Denis Voronenkov met a Post journalist in the lobby bar of Kiev?s five-star Premier Palace Hotel, along with his wife, seeming to feel he was in danger. ?For our personal safety, we can?t let them know where we are,? he said. Both Voronenkov and his wife were former members of Russia?s lower house of parliament, the State Duma, but defected to Ukraine, wherehe became an outspoken critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin and his cronies. ??
?It?s a totally amoral system, and in its anger it may go to extreme measures,? he said to the journalist. ?There?s been a demonization of us. It?s hard to say what will happen. The system has lost its mind. They say we are traitors in Russia.? Less than 72 hours later, Voronenkov was shot twice in the head in broad daylight outside the same lobby bar. Ukraine?s president, Petro Poroshenko,called it ?an act of state terrorism by Russia,? which Putin?s spokesman called ?absurd.? ?
The same week, on March 21, Nikolai Gorokhov, a lawyer for the family of whistleblower Sergei Magnitsky, fell from the fourth floor of his apartment building, suffering serious injuries. Gorokhov was scheduled to appear in court the next day on a matter relating to Magnitsky, who died in prison from maltreatment in November 2009 after revealing a massive financial fraud by Russian officials.
? These are only the latest in the string of violence and death that has trailed those who criticize Putin and his regime. Boris Nemtsov, the opposition leader and one-time deputy prime minister, was assassinated while walking home across a bridge within sight of the Kremlin walls. Alexander Litvinenko, a former KGB officer who had become a fierce critic of Putin, was killed in London with radioactive polonium placed in his tea. The killers - and those who gave them orders - have not been brought to justice. These are the marks of a regime that practices the most brutal retribution and coercion against its critics. ??
Contrast this with the courage of Alexei Navalny, an anti-corruption campaigner and potential challenger to Putin, who has persisted in questioning the honesty of Russia?s leaders despite repeated, crude attempts to silence him with trumped-up prosecutions. Recently, he published a report showing that Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev has accumulated more than $1 billion worth of property. On Sunday, tens of thousands of people in more than 80 Russian cities heeded Navalny?s call for unsanctioned, peaceful protests against corruption. The authorities censored the protests on state- controlled news media and arrested hundreds for the crime of participating in an unapproved rally, including Navalny. ??
What the tableau showed most clearly is that, once again, Russian state and society have cleaved. The state is in the hands of Putin and his cronies, who enrich themselves in power, neutralize their foes and summon the riot police to squelch dissent. Russian society - at least some of it - sees the Putin regime for what it is. On the streets Sunday, their understanding could not be denied and their discontent could not be killed. ? ??

JO requests for debate on UNHRC Resolution on April 6
	
The Joint Opposition (JO) had requested for a debate in Parliament on April 6 to go through the content of the UNHRC Resolution, the Daily Mirror learns.
The JO earlier claimed that the UN Human Rights Council (UNHRC) resolution which was passed without a vote in Geneva last week was detrimental to the sovereignty of the country.
JO leader MP Dinesh Gunawardena said the approval had been granted for the debate based on a request they made during the Party Leaders? Meeting held in Parliament on Friday.
Addressing the weekly news briefing of the JO, the MP said the incumbent Government had gone ahead with the resolution placing the Government?s interest at first, unlike previous Government, which thought about the country first.
?Some of the resolution recommendations violate the Constitution. Especially the sixth clause which recommends foreign judges and prosecutors in an accountability mechanism is a clear violation of the Constitution. Though Prime Minister has said that there was no room for foreign judges in a domestic mechanism, the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) keep pushing for a new Constitution to make room for foreign judges,? he said.
He said Foreign Minister Mangala Samaraweera had violated the Constitution by agreeing to the Clause 6 and requesting only for a two-year extension to implement all recommendations without amending the 6th Clause.
However, Foreign Minister Samaraweera on Tuesday said neither the Government nor the international community was obsessed with the inclusion of foreign judges in a domestic mechanism to probe into war crime charges.
He said the Government?s main concern was to create a fair, independent and credible judicial mechanism. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Monster storm threatens mass devastation along Queensland coast
	
Cyclone Debbie?s ?destructive core? has finally struck the north coast of Queensland, bringing devastating gale-force winds with gusts of 275km/h, record-breaking rainfall and surging tides threatening widespread floods.
After battering the Whitsunday Islands for five straight hours, the storm closed in on Australia?s east coast before making landfall between Bowen and Airlie Beach just after midday. It was downgraded to a Category 3 as it hit the mainland.
Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk described the cyclone a ?one in a hundred year event?, warning residents across the 1000-odd kilometre stretch of picturesque coastline to bunker down and wait for the dangerous storm to pass. ?What we have seen is rainfall in excess of 210 millimetres that has fallen within the past hour. This is equivalent to a one in a hundred year event... we are seeing unprecedented levels of rainfall in that area,? Ms Palaszczuk said. ?After the storm set in, a man was badly injured after he was struck by a falling wall in Proserpine and was rushed to hospital in an unknown condition.?

No way to win a war
	
?
(c) 2017, The Washington Post ? ??
Until now there has been a stark contrast between the tactics of the U.S.-backed military campaign to recapture Mosul, Iraq, from the Islamic State and those of Russian and Syrian government forces attacking rebels in neighboring Syria. The latter has featured deliberate bombing of civilian targets, including hospitals, food stores and aid convoys, at the cost of thousands of lives. ??
In Mosul, meanwhile, Iraqi counterterrorism forces have sustained heavy casualties in street fighting while limiting the use of artillery and airstrikes to avoid civilian deaths, winning praise from humanitarian groups. ??
A U.S. airstrike that may have killed scores or even hundreds of people in Mosul on March 17 may now tarnish that record. Iraqi civil defence officials are saying the attack targeted a building in Mosul?s al-Jadida neighbourhood where many people were crowded in a basement; the remains of more than 100 had been recovered by Sunday. On Saturday, the Pentagon confirmed that the coalition had targeted Islamic State fighters ?at the location corresponding to the allegations of civilian casualties? and said a formal inquiry was underway. ??
Confusion still surrounds the incident: Iraqi military authorities are saying the casualties were caused by booby traps the Islamic State had planted in the house, or by a suicide car bomb that detonated nearby. There?s no question that the jihadists are using civilians as shields, forcing them to stay in homes that are used as firing positions. It is nevertheless vital that U.S. authorities determine as quickly as possible whether an American or coalition bomb caused the civilian deaths, and, if so, accept responsibility. ??
It?s equally important that U.S. and Iraqi forces minimize further civilian casualties as they reclaim the remaining, densely populated areas of Mosul still held by the Islamic State. Once the fight is over, the Shiite-led Iraqi government will face the stiff political challenge of stabilizing a multiethnic city that includes hundreds of thousands of Sunnis; that will be all the more difficult if the pro-government forces have inflicted heavy casualties. ??
U.S. commanders appear to understand the stakes. Gen. Joseph Votel, leader of U.S. Central Command,issued a statement saying?the death of innocent civilians in Mosul is a terrible tragedy? and that the coalition ?will continue to take extraordinary measures to avoid harming civilians.? U.S. spokesmen say the rules of engagement governing airstrikes, which are tailored to avoid civilian deaths, have not changed. ??
Outside observers nevertheless are speculating that the advent of the Trump administration has loosened restraints on U.S. attacks in the Middle East. A controversial Jan. 29 raid in Yemen, approved by President Donald Trump, killed up to a dozen civilians, according to Votel. A U.S. airstrike in Syria?s Aleppo province on March 16 is under investigation amid allegations that it killed scores of civilians gathered in a mosque; the Pentagon described the target as an al-Qaeda gathering. ??
President Barack Obama was frequently criticized, with some reason, for micromanaging military strike decisions and exercising excessive caution. Trump, on the other hand, has talked loosely about heavily bombing Islamic State-held areas and has stepped up direct U.S. involvement in the fighting. Defeating the Islamic State more quickly through the greater use of U.S. force is a worthy goal. But doing so at the cost of higher civilian casualties would be a serious mistake. ??

Pregnant SL woman assaulted in UK
	
A pregnant woman is fighting for her life after she was seriously hurt in a hit-and-run by thugs as they tried to rob her off licence.
The Sri Lankan woman - who is believed to be four or five months pregnant - had her face run over by raiders as they escaped in a grey Volkswagen Polo.
Police revealed the woman suffered wounds to her head and face as well as internal injuries, and remains in a 'stable but life-threatening' condition at Southend Hospital.
A friend, who did not want to be named, revealed the horror that unfolded in the quiet seaside settlement of Leigh-on-Sea, Essex.
'Three people came into the shop,' the friend said. 'They used a credit card to pay and she pulled it out and called her husband.
'But they took it and ran away, so she chased after them and she fell down in the road and they ran over her face.
'She was on her own at the time and she is four or five months pregnant. It's really sad, she only came over from Sri Lanka a year ago.'
Locals reacted in shock to the news that the family-run business was targeted.
Tom Triggs, 54, said: 'She has a little boy about two and they are a lovely family. My grandchildren go in there all the time, they are really nice people.'
A barber who works opposite from the shop that was closed today said he was stunned by the raid.
John Lloyd, who own Lloyds Gentlemen's Barbers, said: 'It's scary, round here you wouldn't expect it. I can't get my head around it.'
A 25-year-old man was arrested at an address in London in the early hours of this morning. He remains in custody and a car has also been recovered.
He was arrested on suspicion of dangerous driving, assault, fraud by false representation and failing to stop at the scene of an accident.
Detective Inspector Stuart Truss said: 'The shop was very busy at that time of day and there were also a lot of people in the area who may have seen what happened.
'I would urge anyone who witnessed the incident or has any other information about it to come forward and contact us.' (Daily Mail)

He said the law should be implemented following an inquiry on financial and political aspects with regard to the incident.
Mr. Dissanayake said the Prime Minister wanted to suppress the investigations and added that they acted to weaken Bribery Commission, FCID and CID which were responsible for investigating such incidents.
?The Bond issue should have been investigated by the Bribery Commission, FCID and CID. It is not a matter that should be investigated by the COPE or through a Presidential Commission,? he said. (Ajith Siriwardana)

## Title: Scotland votes for second independence referendum

Scotland votes for second independence referendum
	
Only hours before Britain is to embark on its momentous journey out of the European Union, Scotland?s Parliament on Tuesday underscored one of the risks along that path by voting to demand a new referendum on Scottish independence, the New York Times reported on Tuesday.
By a vote of 69 to 59, members of the Scottish Parliament in Edinburgh approved plans to request a referendum on independence that could take place just before Britain completes its withdrawal from the European Union, a process known as Brexit.
That timing has already been rejected by Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain, who must agree to any legally binding referendum on Scotland?s future.
Nevertheless, the Scottish Parliament?s vote sets the stage for a constitutional tussle between London and Edinburgh, and it illustrates the far-reaching, and destabilizing, consequences of Britain?s divisive decision in June to withdraw from the European Union. In that referendum, 52 percent of voters chose to leave the European Union.
But Scotland voted, 62 percent to 38 percent, to remain in the bloc, illustrating a divergence between Scottish and English politics that poses an existential risk to Britain. In Northern Ireland, too, a majority voted to remain in the European Union, amid fears that a withdrawal could weaken the peace process there.
The Scottish vote came on the eve of a historic day for the British government intent on disentangling itself from more than four decades of European integration.
The vote on Tuesday empowers Scotland?s pro-independence first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, to formally request a referendum, but she already knows Mrs. May?s answer: not now.
The British government plans to withhold agreement at least until it has secured its departure from the bloc, scheduled for the first half of 2019.
On Tuesday, David Mundell, the British government?s Scottish secretary, seemed to push the timetable further by saying that government ?won?t be entering into any negotiations at all until the Brexit process is complete.? That hints at a date beyond the British withdrawal and after any further transitional period, perhaps several years later.
Nevertheless, Britain?s vote has given Ms. Sturgeon?s governing Scottish National Party a reason to demand another independence referendum, less than three years after it lost the last one in 2014.
At that time, Scots were told that if they voted to leave Britain, they would lose their place in the European Union. They may now lose it anyway. Ms. Sturgeon argued that Scots should have the right to choose between Brexit ?or becoming an independent country, able to chart our own course and create a true partnership of equals across these islands.?
Ms. Sturgeon argues that the shape of any Brexit deal should be known by autumn 2018. Scots should then have the opportunity to try, through independence, to stay in the European Union, or at least in its single market and customs union, she has said.
But with London intent on blocking a referendum anytime soon, Ms. Sturgeon?s best hope may be for Mrs. May?s stalling tactics to backfire ? annoying Scots enough to persuade a majority to support independence if they finally have the chance to vote.

Sleep is essential
	
?
According to Marslow?s pyramid of needs; food, warmth, water and sleep are basic human needs. Quality sleep is essential for a balanced life. Sleep is a?crucial process that we all need?to understand. ??
The amount of sleep necessary depends on the age. For the very young and very old, more sleep is recommended. ??
?
Children in Kindergarten?8 - 10 hours
	Adolescence - 6- 8 hours?
	Adults - at least 6 hours
There are two phases in sleep known as non-REM (Rapid Eye Movement) sleep and REM sleep, in which many different things take place in the body. ??
?
Physical repairing?
Sleep is an active process in which biological functions like respiration, the heart beat and the elementary tract are at work, even though certain parts of the brain have reduced activity. A reversible loosening of conciousness is evident in sleep. Yet growth in the body, bone and cell repair are taking place while a person is resting. Kids are required to have long periods of sleep because it is crucial to their growth. Different hormones are secreted during sleep. Sex hormones are one?
such example. ??
?
?
?Mental repairing
Like physical mending, there is a lot happening on an unconscious level because the day?s activities are registered in our existing memory. Short-term memories are sent and registered as long-term memories. That?s why sleep is crucial for students, because what they learn during the day is added to their memory in their sleep. New knowledge is also integrated into a network of?
past knowledge. ??
Circadian Rhythm
The circadian rhythm is the 24-hour based biological clock ticking inside humans, plants, fungi, animals?and cyanobacteria. ??
It depends on elements like light (sunlight) and temperature. ??
According to the circadian rhythm, the highest alertness is felt around 10 am. Cardiovascular efficiency and muscle strength is strongest at 5 pm. Highest blood pressure is present at 6.30 pm. Melatonin secretion starts at 9 pm. Deepest sleep is at 2 am and the lowest body temperature is at 4.30 am. ?
?
?Dreams?
Famous psychologist Sigmund Freud said sleep was the golden pathway to the unconscious. He believed dreams could be interpreted to unveil the inner self and that the subconscious mind contained hidden impulses, such as sexual and basic animal instincts. ??
?
?
?Sleep is a habit?
People might try to control their sleep and remain awake. True, it can be controlled to a certain extent. Completely avoiding sleep is unhealthy, however. The brain cannot function without sleep because it is the brain?s resting time. ??
Sleep is a routine. There should be a time to sleep and wake up. If the routine is well-balanced, you will have a?quality sleep. Avoid reading, gaming, watching movies and other sleep-killing activities in bed. ??
?
?
Sleep hygiene?
Your bed and bedsheets should?
be hygienic. A warm drink like milk or warm water can be taken to provide better sleep. It?s neither advisable to go to sleep on an empty stomach or with a completely full stomach. Dinner should be taken at least one hour prior to bedtime. (If you go to sleep soon after dinner, the digestion process will be disturbed). Exercising in the evening is also a good way to have a good night?s sleep. Avoid artificial sleeping agents such as drugs, sleep tablets?
and alcohol. ??
?
Sleep disorders?
?Sleepwalking - this can be highly dangerous. It?s not advisable to wake someone who walks in their sleep and a wet cloth should be placed near their beds or outside the room. When their feet touch it, they will wake up naturally. ??
	?Nocturnal polyuria - urinating during sleep. There are two levels- primary and secondary. In the primary level, a person with this disorder urinates regularly during the night and the cause is related to genetics. In the secondary level, the wetting happens during a certain period. This second state is seen in children who were sexually abused, as they are in distress and face emotional turmoil. ??
	?Night terror - Seeing fearful dreams but not being able to remember them. ??
	?Nightmares - Scary dreams the sleeper can remember. ?
	?Primary insomnia - Inability to go to sleep. Poor sleep is also a cause?
	of depression. ??
	?Don?t overestimate sleep or your ability to stay awake
A lack of sleep affects mood and the higher functions of the body. Irritability, pessimism, forgetfulness and poor concentration are visible results.?
When brain rest is disrupted, people tend to make mistakes. Therefore, skipping sleep is pointless as it reduces quality of life and puts a person at risk, especially due to fatigue (many motor accidents happen at night due to lack of sleep). ??

Treatment to halt  constant vomiting  in pregnant mothers  and the sick
	
Vomiting in the early stages of pregnancy is common and ?many mothers go through it. Ayurvedic physician D.D.A. Hettiarachchi ?enlightens us on an ancient practice that has been forgotten in ?society. ??
The method
Find some shards of a fresh and unused clay pot or buy a a ?water pot better known as a ?Navum Kalaya? from a local pot vendor. ?Expose the pot to extreme heat by setting seven or eight coconut shells ?on fire. Place the clay pieces in the fire until the shards become ?change their colour (at a certain higher temperature they appear to be ?white in colour). Put the burning pot shards into clean lukewarm water. ?Let the water cool and remove the shards of clay. Filter the water using ?a cloth and administer the water in small quantities to the vomiting ?person. ?This is the ancient saline used by our people? Dr. ?Hettiarachchi emphasized adding that special care of cleanliness in the ?process is a must.
??
The science behind the practice
Fresh clay in newly made pots includes salts. When the ?freshly-built clay in a pot is burned and added to water, the salts in ?the clay seep in, which is similar to saline that is given to the sick. ? ??
According to the experience of Dr. Hettiarachchi, this treatment can be used to stop continuous vomiting in a patient. ??
We also approached Consultant Community Physician ? Dr. ?Shanthi Gunawardena to ask about the stance of Western Medicine in such a ?practice. ??
?It could have certain properties as mentioned by the ?Ayurvedic doctor. In western medical practice, it is difficult to ?approve this treatment without scientifically tested results,? Dr. ?Gunawardena said. ??

UNP to appoint new General Secretary
	
The United National Party (UNP) is likely to appoint a new General Secretary as a part of its restructuring drive, a party senior said yesterday.
UNP General Secretary Kabir Hashim told a media briefing that there is a possibility of party appointing a new general secretary as well. ?UNP is always open for changes and appointment of persons for various positions including the general secretary?s post is never permanent,? he said.
?The party is also in line of thinking that persons who hold positions should be able to work full-time as others have to be involved in government affairs. We, the seniors have to get involved in affairs of the government and therefore positions should be handed over to others, who could work full time,? he said.
Mr. Hashim said the party?s working committee discussed about making changes to the party and creating new positions and revealed that final decision will be made by the working committee when it meets on Wednesday, April 5.
?The party is on the line of thinking that members of other parties who teamed up with the UNP should be given some value. Accordingly, Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka will get a postion. However, the party is yet to decide as to what post he should be given,? Mr. Hashim said. He said the working committee will also finalize plans for the May Day as well, at the working committee meeting.
Meanwhile, he said the party had decided to appreciate those who have played a role in bringing it back to power and to give more concessions to the working class. Accordingly, he said the party had decided to call for a minimum wage system for the government and the private sector workers.(Yohan Perera)

Will it boomerang on her?
	
?
The government office handling the onerous task of promoting post-war reconciliation has kicked off a number of programmes designed to achieve this goal.?
?
Most programmes launched on the initiative of the former Madam who is heading this office have received the patronage of diplomatic sections.
The drama extolling the virtue of national unity and harmony is one of the main strands of the roadmap and a drama now being produced in the Kandy area is expected to create a sensation in the country, they say. ?Meanwhile, serious doubts have been raised by informed ones as to whether this drama will ever go on the boards. The reason they adduce is that it conveys a kind of message that the former Madam will not take kindly to. The message says in clear terms that certain populist measures taken during the regime of the Madam?s father set in the rot of disunity and disharmony in the body politics in the country.
Some people involved in the implementation of the roadmap on reconciliation are said to be waiting with bated breath for the former Madam?s reaction to this drama when she comes to hear about it! ??
