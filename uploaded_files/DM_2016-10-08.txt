Groups spreading false propaganda to divide country:President
	
Some groups say that the government is trying to divide the country by betraying it. They say that Buddhism is going to lose its pole position due to the new constitution. They say the government is removing the military camps in the North. I kindly invite them to meet me and show me where these things are taking place, President Maithripala Sirisena said.
The President was speaking at the inauguration of the project to renovate the Vam Ivuru Ela in Minipe. The project is being carried out under the governments programme to renovate the irrigation system built by the ancient kings of Sri Lanka. These irrigation system will be renovated, utilizing modern irrigation technology, he said.
President Sirisena said that the current government would build Sri Lanka into a strong, exemplary and great country by strengthening historical greatness which has been prevailing for thousands of years.
Though some groups are criticizing the freedom and democracy prevailing in the country even while enjoying them, we will build the country by getting together with those who want to work for the country, he said. In their interviews to the media some people today give the impression that the government is going to collapse before the sunrise tomorrow. After an election of a government, everyones responsibility is not just to criticize the government but to support that government for the betterment of the country and the people.
To build a strong economy we should strengthen the livelihoods of farmers and their economy," the President said.

## Title: Indian woman with SL passport receives back wages for 14 years in Jeddah

Indian woman with SL passport receives back wages for 14 years in Jeddah
	
An Indian woman, who had come to the Kingdom with a Sri Lanka passport as a housemaid, received SR45, 000 in back wages for 14 years of employment on the intervention of the Sri Lankan Consulate in Jeddah.
The maid, Kedeswari Sellamuthu from Chennnai, Tamil Nadu, went to Sri Lanka in 2003 and was sent to the Kingdom for employment on a Sri Lankan passport.
Sellamuthu, who holds a passport under the name of Zareena Salee, confessed to the Sri Lankan Consulate in Jeddah that she had obtained a Sri Lankan passport through an agent who trained her to pose as a Muslim woman from Sri Lanka to obtain the Lankan passport. She had submitted forged documents to obtain a Sri Lankan passport from the Sri Lankan Immigration Department.
She said that there were two other women who had come to Sri Lanka in a similar situation, and they were sent to Kuwait for employment.
Sri Lankan Consul General Faizer Mackeen, who personally dealt with the case, told Arab News that this is a clear case of human trafficking into the Kingdom by unscrupulous agents in Sri Lanka.
Although the consulate has pursued the Saudi sponsor to obtain her back wages on humanitarian grounds, Mackeen said that the maid will be subject to severe grilling by investigators in Colombo to determine the culprits behind the scene.
On arrival at the Colombo airport, the maid will be taken for questioning by investigators.
It needs the attention of the relevant authorities and investigations to find out the truth behind this racket, which could also be a security lapse, the diplomat said.
Mackeen further explained that the maid had contracted with the Saudi employer for a monthly salary of SR400, which was not paid at all by the sponsor during the past 14 years. The sponsor, he said, has now paid the back wages as well as the airfare to Sri Lanka.
Deputy Foreign Minister Harsha de Silva alleged that there has been an agency mafia operating for a long time in the country which has been exploiting unsuspecting workers who depend on them to find work. This is a clear example of such an activity, he added.
According to the deputy minister, job agents charge employers SR25, 000 for each Sri Lankan sent to work in Saudi Arabia through the agency, while agent fees charged from all other nations remained less than SR15, 000. (Arab News)

PM on Wigneswaran: 'Let's go ahead by preparing the new Constitution'
	
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe who responded to recent statements made by Northern Province Chief Minister C V Wigneswaran, yesterday suggested that Parliament should get on with the task of preparing a new Constitution no matter what the Chief Minister or anyone says about it.
It is the constitutional assembly and the steering committee which decides on the constitution and not the chief minister. There may be some who would oppose the proposals of the steering committee report and some who would welcome it. Therefore lets get on with our duty, Mr Wickremesinghe said in response to a question raised by Joint opposition group Leader Dinesh Gunawardene last morning.
I arrived in the country last morning. I have been asked about a statement made by Chief Minister Wigneswaran. I have also seen some news items when I was in India that he had denied the statement issued by the media, he added.
He said the new constitution was prepared by the House. Lets do it the way we want, some people may make statements. Even others have made statements in addition to the Chief Minister. It is better if everyone refrains from making statements, he further said. (Yohan Perera)

SL asylum seeker says he wanted to ' suicide bomb ' a train in UK
	
A Sri Lankan asylum seeker who said he wanted to ' suicide bomb ' a train was calmly told by a worker that he couldn't get on without a ticket.
Sureshkumar Thurairajah, 44, wore a bulging anorak zipped up to his neck and a baseball cap covering part of his face at Liverpool's Lime Street Station.
When asked if he had a ticket at the underground station s barriers he told Merseyrail worker David Evans: I want to suicide bomb the train.
But a judge praised Mr Evans' cool response.
Judge Anil Murray said: In the present climate where bombs are used to cause terror, the very threat to use a bomb, whether real or not, is likely to cause fear and panic.
Thankfully Mr Evans remained calm. He told you that you couldnt get on the platform without a ticket, then contacted police, who approached, searched you and there was in fact no bomb.
Thurairajah was arrested at the station by British Transport Police at around 3.20pm on April 1 this year.
Liverpool Crown Court heard the Sri Lankan earlier suffered a breakdown after collapsing and being taken to hospital when told of his failed asylum bid.
Gareth Roberts, prosecuting, said Thurairajah told police officers he wanted to throw himself in front of a train.
He later explained he heard voices in his head and wanted to kill himself and was taken to hospital for treatment.
Thurairajah, of Wrexham, who has no previous convictions, admitted communicating false information.
He later tried to change his guilty plea, but the application was rejected after a two-day hearing.
Eric Lamb, defending, said his client left Sri Lanka where he was accused of being part of the Tamil Tigers terrorist group.
He said: He is subject to a warrant in Sri Lanka where he had been suspected of spying for the Tamil Tigers.
The defendant makes clear to me that is a false accusation but it is certainly a matter that looms very large in the defendants thoughts and his situation.
A doctors report revealed Thurairajah witnessed terrible events in Sri Lanka and was diagnosed as suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder.
Despite numerous suicide attempts, the doctor did not believe he required hospital treatment and could be treated in the community.
Mr Lamb said eight supporters in the public gallery confirmed Thurairajah was well-regarded thanks to his voluntary work.
He urged the judge to impose a sentence of less than 12 months, as he intends to appeal against his deportation, which is automatic if jailed for a year or more.
Mr Lamb said: This was an unhappy exception to the defendants otherwise good conduct and there were plainly extreme pressures upon him at the time.
The court heard he had previously been hospitalised in March after telling police he wanted to die.
Mr Lamb said: When detained by the police he said he was a terrorist and had links with al-Qaeda.
Judge Murray accepted Thurairajah had mental health problems and received bad news about his immigration status, which made him agitated.
He said supporters described him as kind-hearted, helpful and community-spirited and he had received a Community Action award.
The judge said: Its clear you have made a positive contribution to the community you live in.
Judge Murray handed Thurairajah 10 months in prison, prompting him to clasp his hands in prayer and say: Thank you  God bless you.(Mirror.co.uk)
