A man larger than life
	
Mohan Lalvani, the youngest of the famous Lalvani Family comprising 7 sisters and 4 brothers, passed away peacefully on August 8, 2017. 
Mohan was a gifted sales person and handled the day to day marketing and sales of the famous store down Main Street in Pettah, the Lalvani Brothers. After a long stint with the family business he ventured into the mercantile sector and joined the Maharaja Organization as a Director.
He was a larger than life personality, a trusted and dependable friend, for people from all walks of life, both in Sri Lanka and overseas.
As a loving husband, father and father-in-law, he played his part to the very end. Im sure every daughter would want a father like him. Nothing was impossible when it came to his family and he provided everything we wanted without complaining. He was a strict disciplinarian and an honest man of his word which was appreciated by like minded people.
He loved and adored his four legged grandchild Isabelle and spent long hours with her everyday making sure all her needs and wants were met without delay.
With his birthanniversary on the 21st of October and Christmas around the corner we fondly remember and miss him for his various involvements in the preparations and drive to get things done.
He was the life of a party, and along with his hundreds of friends and associates he lived his life to the fullest. There was never a dull moment with him around. He was sought after for his jokes and quotes and his sense of humor will long echo in at the famous 80 Club of Colombo.
All of a sudden on a fateful Tuesday morning in August he said his final goodbye. He will always be remembered for his colorful life and devil may care attitude.
It would be impossible to include everything on paper regarding someone, a larger than life personality-like Mohan Lalvani. Everyone who associated with him closely will fondly remember and treasure those lovely moments spent with him.
Goodbye daddy, hubby, grandpa, father-in-law, brother and uncle, until we see you again on the other side.
Like a sunlight fading in the clear blue sky, you were gone too soon.
Loving daughter
Sharon Lalvani

Australian Government shaky afterHigh Court disqualifies deputy PM
	
Deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce and four other federal politicians with foreign citizenship issues have been sensationally disqualified from Parliament. 
The bombshell High Court ruling has triggered a by-election in his electorate of New England after the court on Friday found his New Zealand citizenship disqualified him. 
A by-election loss would leave Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull with a minority government for the first time since 2016. 
The business of government goes on, he said.The Prime Minister is due to fly out of Australia later on Friday to attend the 100th anniversary of the Battle of Beersheba in Israel, and make a flying visit to Sri Lanka on the way back. 
He did not indicate who would be acting prime minister in his absence. 
Mr Turnbull said he was obviously disappointed with the courts ruling, despite his smiling expression while giving a brief statement to media. The prime minister quickly walked away from reporters and refused to answer additional questions. Mr Joyces deputy Fiona Nash, One Nation senator Malcolm Roberts and former Greens senators Scott Ludlam and Larissa Waters were also ruled ineligible by the High Court after months of debate.

Mr Turnbull said the coalition had the majority of members in the House of Representatives and had the support from some of the crossbench.

Catalans declare independence from Spain
	
The Catalan regional parliament has voted to declare independence from Spain, while the Spanish parliament has approved direct rule over the region, BBC reported last evening.
Catalan MPs had easily approved the move amid an opposition boycott.
Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy had told senators direct rule was needed to return "law, democracy and stability" to Catalonia.
The crisis began earlier this month when Catalonia held a controversial referendum on independence.
The Catalan government said that of the 43% of potential voters who took part, 90% were in favour of independence.
But Spain's Constitutional Court had ruled the vote illegal. A motion declaring independence was approved on Friday with 70 in favour, 10 against, and two abstentions in the 135-seat chamber.
The measure calls for the transfer of legal powers from Spain to an independent Catalonia. But the Spanish Constitutional Court is likely to declare it illegal, while the US, UK, Germany and France all expressed support for Spanish unity.
European Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker said the EU "doesn't need any more cracks, more splits".
Catalan President Carles Puigdemont has called for supporters to "maintain the momentum" in a peaceful manner.
Crowds have been celebrating the declaration of independence and Spanish flags have been removed from some regional government buildings in Catalonia.
The pro-independence crowd outside the parliament followed the session vote by vote.
The crowd met every Yes vote with a cheer - and every No with a boo. At the end, there was a huge cheer.
Soon after the vote at the regional parliament, the Senate - Spain's upper house - made the unprecedented step of approving measures allowing the Spanish government to impose direct rule over Catalonia.
There were 214 votes in favour and 47 against. Urging calm, Prime Minister Rajoy said: "Spain is a serious country, it is a great nation and we are not prepared in any way to allow some people to liquidate our constitution."
He is holding a cabinet meeting to decide what measures to take. It could include the firing of Catalan leaders, and the Spanish government taking control of the region's finances, police and publicly owned media.

Constitution making: MPs mustn't support SC report: Elle Gunawansa Thera
	
Ven. Elle Gunawansa Thera yesterday asked the government not to deceive the people with regard to the Steering Committee (SC) report and urged the MPs to avoid supporting it when presented in Parliament.
The interim report is to be debated in Parliament on October 30, 31 and November 1.
The monk told a news conference organised by the Yuthukama Forum that MPs especially those from the two factions of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) should not support the interim report.
By all means, the MPs can keep the vehicles and all privileges they enjoy but please dont support this sin. I will visit constituencies represented by the MPs and make people aware of the dangers if this report is approved, he said.
The monk said he had no faith in any political party and said politics had dragged the country to an abyss and it was clergy and the laity who were maintaining this country.
He said neither the Prime Minister nor anyone else had the right to question the statement made by the Karaka Sangha Sabha.
We dont ask whether the Premier or the Ministers whether they were there when Cabinet decisions are made, the Thera said.
With regard to the proposal to abolish the executive presidency, the Thera said the 13th Amendment to the Constitution should be abolished before pruning the powers of the presidency.
Former Bar Association of Sri Lanka (BASL) Secretary Sarath Wijesinghe said the 13A was forced on us by outsiders.
The current Constitution too has federalist features. Its unitary character has been preserved because of the powers of the executive presidency. The US and India can afford to maintain a federal system because those countries are enormous but not small like ours, he said and added that the questions asked by the BASL on the constitutional-making process were compiled legally.
If anyone has quarries or doubts about the legality of the way the questions were asked, they can attend the upcoming BASL conference today and see for themselves, Mr. Wijesinghe said.
Former Ruhuna University Vice-Chancellor Susirith Mendis said a constitutional draft had already been prepared and the proposed three-day debate on the interim report was an eyewash.
He said the new Constitution was a result of an international conspiracy and the constitutional process had become a play of words.
Yuthukama Forum Head Gevindu Kumaratunga said there was no need to bomb Parliament because the committee report itself would become a bomb if it was passed. We urge the government to throw this report into the Diyawannawa, he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Innovative Governance, Open Cities
	
With the National Unity Government being heavily involved in building port and mega cities, there is special significance for Sri Lanka in World Cities Day which will be marked by the United Nations next Tuesday October 31. The main aim is to promote the international communitys interest in global urbanization, push forward cooperation among countries in meeting opportunities and addressing challenges of urbanization and contributing to sustainable urban development around the world, the UN says. This years theme is Innovative Governance, Open Cities to highlight the important role of urbanization as a source of global development and social inclusion.
According to the UN, urbanization provides the potential for new forms of social inclusion, including greater equality, access to services and new opportunities, engagement and mobilization that reflect the diversity of cities, countries and the globe. Yet too often this is not the shape of urban development. Inequality and exclusion abound, often at rates greater than the national average, at the expense of sustainable development that delivers for all.
The UN says, Sustainable Development Goal 11, formulates the ambition to make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable. This underlines the relevance of UN-Habitats mission. Inequalities in cities have grown since 1980. The worlds largest cities are also often the most unequal, and this years theme is embraced by the action and implementation of the new urban agenda, which is putting the topic of inclusive cities as one of the main pillars for the urban shift.
In October 2016, the HABITAT III Conference, held in Quito, adopted a new framework, which will set the world on a course towards sustainable urban development by rethinking how cities are planned, managed and inhabited. The new urban agenda will set the pace on how to deal with the challenges of urbanization in the next two decades, and is seen as an extension of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. This was agreed on by the 193 member states of the UN in September 2015.
The theme for 2016 was Inclusive Cities, Shared Development to highlight the important role of urbanization as a course of global development and social inclusion. Planned urbanization maximizes the capacity of cities to generate employment and wealth, and to foster diversity and social cohesion between different classes, cultures, ethnicities and religions. Cities designed to live together create opportunities, enable connection and interaction and facilitate sustainable use of shared resources, the UN says. 
In Sri Lanka, Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka has repeatedly promised that the megapolis mission would gradually reduce the number of slums in urban areas so that there would be more equality and less exclusion. This would involve the upgrading of areas where the poverty-trapped people live or survive. They would also need to be given productive and well-paid jobs, instead of just Samurdi benefits, so that the human dignity of these impoverished families could be bestowed. It would be a difficult mission. But the minister, known to be technologically-skilled and a socialist thinker, is confident he could bring about just and fair societies in urban areas. 
On October 20, the National Unity Government also launched a mission to develop and empower some 5,000 villages within the next few years. If the urban development projects and the village empowerment missions are implemented efficiently and with commitment, Sri Lanka would go a long way toward building a just, peaceful and an all-inclusive society.

Journalists awarded  at convocation ceremony
	
Mr. Kumar Nadesan (Right) Chairman of the SLPI addressing the gathering at the convocation held at the BMICH.
The Sri Lanka Press Institute held its Convocation Ceremony to award certificates to 132 journalists for the successful completion of the English for Journalists course. The event was held on Tuesday, October 24, 2017 at the Bandaranaike Memorial International Conference Hall (BMICH). Jim Russo, Director, Press, Cultural and Academic Affairs of the U.S. Embassy was the Chief Guest at the ceremony. 
The Sri Lanka Press Institute launched the English for Journalists program in 2015 with the aim of supporting journalists to enhance communication, reading and writing skills to suit modern journalism. They received the support of the United States Embassy during this programme. Classes were conducted in all nine provinces of the country. 
The project was designed to benefit journalists working for the Sinhala and Tamil media and working at regional level. As many as 197 journalists were selected for the course from nine provinces. This English language program was designed by Dinali Fernando, Head of the Department of English of the University of Kelaniya. The course was specifically designing to support journalistic needs with the necessary linguistic tools that would enable them to develop their skills. 
During the three-month course, the curriculum, designed by language experts, was aimed at providing the students with the best possible practical knowledge. The course was conducted at regional level for the convenience of the journalists from the outstations. Skilled experienced teachers were selected from those localities to conduct classes. 
This was an 18-month project managed by the Sri Lanka Press Institute and was funded by the US Embassy.

More than 2,800 JFK assassination files are released
	

US, (Daily Mail), 27 October 2017 - The White House has released 2,891 documents related to the assassination of John F. Kennedy that have long been kept secret. 
The trove of files was published on the National Archives website on Thursday night, and produced revelations and prompted more questions about the fateful day in Dallas in 1963.
The documents revealed that Lee Harvey Oswald was being tracked by the FBI before JFK was killed and met a KGB agent in Mexico Citys Soviet Embassy two months before the shooting.
An unidentified man also called the FBI and said they were going to kill Oswald - just 24 hours before he was gunned down by Jack Ruby while in police custody.
But not all of the records were released, because President Trump has kept some back so federal agencies can black out portions.
A White House official told DailyMail.com during a conference call that while Trump wants to remove the veil of secrecy regarding the 1963 killing, he has no choice today but to accept those redactions rather than risk irreversible harm to the country.

Programmes lined up to mark St. Joseph Vaz National Day
	

The Catholic National Commission for Laity has organized the St Joseph Vaz National Day on November 4th as the grand finale to the Year of St. Joseph Vaz and to reflect on his life and mission under the theme Let us fulfill the dream of St. Joseph Vaz by bearing witness to the Gospel.
A key aspect of the programme is that the lay people in their gratefulness are coming together to celebrate and reflect on the life of St. Joseph Vaz. The goal of bringing together the faithful is to create an awareness of true discipleship among people. 
The St. Joseph Vaz National Day Programme will unfold at the National Shrine of St. Anthony, Wahakotte. The programme will commence at 11.00am with the inauguration of an exhibition on the life and mission of St. Joseph Vaz and the work of the Lay Apostolates. At 5.00pm there will be a special presentation on the life and mission of St. Joseph Vaz by His Lordship Most Rev. Dr. Vianney Fernando (Bishop of Kandy and the Chairman of St. Joseph Vaz National Secretariat). The highlight of the programme will be a Night Vigil of Prayer commencing at 8.00pm and ending with the Celebration of Holy Mass at 4.00am. 
Though St. Joseph Vaz (1651-1711), Apostle of Sri Lanka was born in Bernaulim, Goa, India, he dedicated his whole life to the resurgence of the Catholic faith in Sri Lanka when he heard of the sufferings of the Catholics under the Dutch. In 1687, braving grave obstacles and a storm at sea, he made his way from Tuticorin, India to Sri Lanka. He and his companion John were off loaded at Mannar, and with much difficulty made their way to Jaffna where his mission began. He encountered not a clerical Church, but a Church of the laity in Sri Lanka when he arrived. The beauty of his mission was that in the absence of Catholic priests he ministered by empowering the lay faithful. He did this by building a lay leadership structure, to collaborate with him in resuscitating the Church. He raised and appointed lay leadership which continued to lead and care for the local flock during his absence in between his visits, encouraging faithfulness. This also resulted in the raising up of mature and committed disciples among the faithful. He displayed heroic sanctity when he ministered the people of Kandy plagued with the small pox epidemic. His deep faith in God and intercessory power was publicly manifested when the long period of drought in Kandy ended with torrential rainfall everywhere except over the area where he was praying. 
St. Joseph Vaz was a pioneer of inculturation. He learnt the local customs and practices, mastered the Sinhala and Tamil languages and thus was able to strengthen and minister to people in the midst of intense persecution. His missionary work was marked by great suffering, rejection, self sacrifice, obedience, fasting, avoidance of comforts, charity and a personal choice to live frugally. In his utter humility, he even rejected praise, acclaim and high leadership positions including that of a Bishop. In lighter vein, he was a master of disguises switching between acting as a coolie to a washerman, to being a bangle seller, in the best interest of saving souls. 
The Catholic Bishops Conference of Sri Lanka has declared this year as the Year of St. Joseph Vaz and the climax of the celebrations will be the St. Joseph Vaz National Day together with the Prayer Night Vigil that will pave the way for us to become a truly participatory and an evangelizing church in Sri Lanka. Various Catholic Lay Apostolate Movements such as St. Vincent de Paul Society, the Legion of Mary, Cursillo, Kithudana Pubuduwa, the Community of the Risen Lord and other lay apostolates under the umbrella of the Catholic National Commission for Laity have come together to organize this program. It is envisaged that this programme will stir the faith of the lay people and foster unity among the Churchs various Lay Apostolates, providing a common platform for them to come together in prayer and celebration.

RAF claims zero civillian casaulties after bombing runs!
	

More than 3,400 British bombs have been dropped on ISIS targets in Iraq and Syria, a new analysis of the war reveals today.
The Ministry of Defence claims to have caused no civilian casualties with the air campaign which began with strikes in northern Iraq in 2014.
The Royal Air Force has flown more than 8,000 sorties since the air war began while a coalition of local forces takes the fight to terrorists on the grounds.
Britain joined an international coalition against the group after it swept into Northern Iraq and Syria to seize territory amid the chaos of the Syrian civil war.
Analysis by the i newspaper that up to September this year, UK forces dropped at least 3,482 bombs and missiles in the battle against ISIS, including 2,089 Paveway IV smart bombs and 486 of the more accurate Brimstone missiles dropped by Typhoon and Tornado jets.
RAF Reaper drones have also fired 724 Hellfire missiles at
ISIS targets.
The Government describes the Brimstone as the most accurate weapon available that can be fired by aircraft, and they are conservatively estimated to cost 100,000 each.An MoD spokesperson said: We have no evidence that RAF strikes have caused civilian casualties. The claim of no civilian casualties is disputed by Airwars, a campaign group monitoring the impact of coalition air strikes.
It warned the RAFs claim was based on observation from the air and not eyewitness accounts on the ground. 
Samuel Oakford, an analyst for Airwars, told i: Given evidence that non-American Coalition members are responsible for civilian deaths, it is incumbent on countries as active in the campaign as the UK to be transparent about what happens after they drop bombs in Iraq
and Syria.

SL housemaid returns after 17 years in Saudi
	
A Sri Lankan maid, who has remained in Saudi Arabia for 17 years, had returned to Sri Lanka yesterday after being paid her salary, the Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment (SLBFE) said.
Media Secretary Nalin Rajapaksa said K.G. Kusumawathi, a resident of Abanpola in Atawarala went to Saudi Arabia in 2000.
She has worked in a remote desert area as a shepherd for 15 years and not got in touch with her family members for the past one and half years, he said.
Mr. Rajapaksa said on a complaint made by her family members to the SLBFE, Foreign Employment and Justice Minister Thalatha Atukorale had directed the labour officers of the Saudi Arabian Embassy to take steps to get her sent back to Sri Lanka.
He said the embassy officials were able to locate Ms. Kusumawathi with the assistance of the immigration and emigration office in Saudi Arabia and the Saudi Arabian Criminal Investigation Department (CID).
Her employer had agreed to pay her Rs.3.6 million as salary arrears, Mr. Rajapaksa said.
Meanwhile, the minister said this could be considered as the largest amount we were able to recover as salary arrears paid to a Sri Lankan migrant worker in SLBFEs history. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)
