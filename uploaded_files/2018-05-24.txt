CEB strengthens Maintenance Management Process with ACECAM
	
Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) is the leading state-owned organization in using Computerized Maintenance Management Solution(CMMS) for utility management in Sri Lanka with its solution partner Acecam (Pvt) Ltd.? CEB continues the journey of improving their entire maintenance management process by implementing ?TOMMS? which is a computerized maintenance management software (CMMS) for its critical asset management in a staggered approach based on the asset concentration.?
?Transmission division, holder of over 60 grid stations, high tension electric lines etc. spread across the country commenced automating the maintenance management process in grand scale with a project kick-off meeting on 3 April 2018 at Moven-pick hotel with the participation of senior officials of CEB and its solution provider Acecam (Pvt).? ?
?Automation of maintenance management process will improve the quality of power supply with efficient preventative maintenance of assets to minimize unexpected breakdowns. Cost savings to the country through this initiative will be enormous and the impact will spread across the entire economy of Sri Lanka.?
?According to a senior officer of Transmission Asset Maintenance Division, ?gone are the days of using traditional methods to keep track of our maintenance program. Hereafter we are planning to store a wealth of information about each asset, including information about warranties, manufacturers, catalogs, vendor details and expenses in a single software which provides us a high traceability and minimize probable human errors in practicing asset maintenance routines.??
Addressing the gathering another senior officer of Transmission Division said that ?after implementing TOMMS CMMS, our team can make correct decisions on assets and its maintenance aspects being on-site or off-site through seamless access to the asset related information via the web. We want to make informed decisions on our assets quickly to minimize unnecessary expenses, delays in the processes and improve service quality.?
According to Mr. Ruwan Manchanayake, Director at Acecam, TOMMS CMMS is an excellent tool useful for the companies that are extremely dependent on the operational state of their equipment, especially in the fields of Manufacturing, Power & Energy, Marine and Offshore, Construction, Transportation & Highways, Irrigation & Water Management, Hospital & Healthcare, Hotel & Leisure Management, Facility Management etc. TOMMS CMMS makes it possible for both the operational and strategic level staff of CEB to collaborate in defining, controlling and managing maintenance tasks pertaining to their assets.

## Title: Dayasiri received Rs.1mn from PTL related company

Dayasiri received Rs.1mn from PTL related company
	
According to a further report (B report) filed into the magisterial inquiry over the Bond scam by the prosecution today, it was revealed that UPFA Parliamentarian Dayasiri Jayasekara had received a cheque of Rs.1 million from Walt & Row Associates-a Perpetual Treasuries Ltd related group company in 2015.?
According to a statement given by a police officer to the CID, who was attached to Mr. Jayasekara?s security in 2015, it was revealed that, on June 13, 2015 Mr. Jayasekara had asked his security officer, Amila Kumara Herath, to encash a cash cheque (Bearing number 566635) which was issued by Walt & Row Associates (under the current account number 0073900773)
According to the statement of Mr. Herath, he then had encashed the cheque from a Kurunegala Bank and subsequently the Money ?in cash? was handed over to Mr. Jayasekara.
Due to the suspicious nature in which Perpetual Treasuries Ltd had transacted with its group companies (W.M. & Mendis and Walt & Row Associates) to encash cheques which had been ultimately lasted with third parties, the prosecution also obtained a court order to the Chief Executive Officer of Walt & Row Associates to provide details about cheque transactions relating to such nature.
A Parliamentarian received ?cash cheque? from PTL related company: ASG Kodagoda
Additional Solicitor General Yasantha Kodagoda today said a cash cheque of ?Walt and Row Associates? - a group company of Perpetual Treasuries Ltd-?amounting to Rs. 1 million, had been encashed by a security officer of a Parliamentarian.
The name of the Parliamentarian which was stated in the B report was not revealed in open courts by the Prosecution.
This was revealed according to a statement given by a police officer to the CID recently, who was attached to the security of the so called Politician.
Elaborating on the suspicious nature in which Perpetual Treasuries Ltd had transacted with its group companies (W.M. & Mendis and Walt & Row Associates) to encash cheques which had been ultimately lasted as money to third parties, ASG Kodagoda revealed another encashment of a cash cheque in similar manner.
ASG Kodagoda said that the investigation had accidentally revealed another similar cheque encashment where an employee of a professional services providing company (Certis Lanka) was interviewed by the CID.
This cheque was also amounting to Rs. 1 million belonging to W.M. & Mendis- a PTL related group company.
It was explained that on behalf of W.M. & Mendis this person had encashed the cheque from a reputed Bank and subsequently the money in cash had been handed over to a third party at the car park of the Bank premises.
The name of this third party was also not revealed in open proceedings by the ASG.
At the onset of the inquiry, ASG Kodagoda also sought necessary court orders in relation to certain details of the secondary market transactions of PTL.
He explained that it was not only about how PTL operated in the Primary Market but also how it dealt within the bond related secondary market.
It was explained that every primary dealer like PTL had to maintain records about their secondary market dealings in both physical nature (as paper works) and in the scriptless computer system contemporaneously with the Central Bank's computer system (RTGS).
This computer system that primary dealers operate in relation with secondary market deals is installed and maintained generally by a company called Lanka Finance Services Bureau.
In view of identifying whether PTL had fed its secondary transactions properly into the CBSL scriptless system via its computer system provided by LFSB, Fort Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne directed LFSB to provide all details relating to secondary market transactions of PTL including ?SWIFT messages? from January 2015 to February 2018.
The Magistrate also directed Geoffrey Aloysius who was the second share holder of PTL to provide all the physical documents that it maintained during all bond transactions to the prosecution. (By Shehan Chamika Silva)

Elections: the Yahapalanists? true fear
	
Minister Mangala Samaraweera, speaking to the media at the Finance Ministry on Tuesday (May 22), stated that knowing well the crimes committed by Gotabaya Rajapaksa, he is in fact frightened of the former defence secretary. That?s political-speak, obviously. Mangala, after all, was never scared of the LTTE, was never scared of Chandrika Kumaratunga and certainly not of Ranil Wickremesinghe, even though the names of these individuals were directly or indirectly mentioned along with certain questionable deeds in the past.? ?
The truth is that Mangala is fearful for his political future as that of his party and the yahapalana regime. The same goes for those in the UNP and those in the yahapalana regime ? ministers, MPs and backers. It?s not a gota-baya (fear of Gota) but a pana-baya on account of clearly sliding fortunes
Moreover, someone who didn?t think twice of unleashing a kurundu-polu attack on supporters of his own party and is a prominent member of a corrupt and inept government can?t afford to talk about such fears.? ?
The truth is that Mangala is fearful for his political future as that of his party and the yahapalana regime. The same goes for those in the UNP and those in the yahapalana regime ? ministers, MPs and backers. It?s not a gota-baya (fear of Gota) but a pana-baya on account of clearly sliding fortunes. And barring a highly unlikely turnaround in approval ratings, these people would be scared of anyone, not just Gota. In other words any candidate picked by the joint opposition to go against Ranil Wickremesinghe or Maithripala Sirisena or both has excellent chances of becoming the next president.? ?
The problem is not Gotabaya but the corruption, nepotism and other abuses of this regime. The yahapalanists have effectively taken the oomph out of all the slogans used by them in the run-up to the January 2015 presidential election. Most importantly, claims that Gotabaya?s programme is a carbon copy of the UNP?s vision for the future, are easily dealt with. If it?s the same programme then the only issue at hand is how to deliver. The UNP has proved beyond all reasonable doubt that it is not only a won?t-do-party but more ominously, a can?t-do-party. In fact, just as it can be argued that no one helped Maithripala Sirisena?s cause than Mahinda Rajapaksa, it?s the yahapalanists who are giving Gotabaya?s campaign the biggest boost. Mangala may believe his fear-mongering would awaken the despondent UNP activist from slumber, but it may very well have the opposite effect: Make him/her roll over and sleep longer.? ?
All yahapalana politicians can be terrified about going before the people after what happened on February 10, 2018
There?s a simple question which brings us to the real source of fear: Why is this government not holding provincial council elections?? ?
The entire country saw how the yahapalanists were scared out of their wits over facing the voter at the local level. They went to court to subvert this basic exercise in democracy. When the Elections Commission pointed out that objections raised did not apply to as many as 93 local government bodies, they got another set of proxies to object to the original objections. All that had to happen before elections were held. Both major parties in the ruling coalition were routed.? ?
Having ?fixed? the Local Government Elections Act to make a mockery of the much bragged about ?mixed system? and still going on to lose, the yahapalanists started getting nostalgic about proportional representation. The old foot-dragging card ?delimitation? was once again drawn from the pack of limited options. Faizer Mustapha, who played a particularly pernicious role in the courtroom drama regarding local government elections, is sitting on relevant legislation.? ?
The elections to the Eastern, North-Central and Sabaraguma Provincial Councils were held on September 8, 2012. Their relevant terms of office ended, therefore, in September 2017. Elections for the North, Central and North-Western Provincial Councils were held on September 21, 2013 and their terms of office are to end in four months from now.? ?
Now if the Yahapalanists and other Devolutionazis were to concede, as they should, that these provincial councils are white elephants and that whether or not they exist makes little difference, it would make some sense. They are not ready to do that. If so, the most basic way of affirming political convictions would be to have them function. For this, elections need to be held. They are not being held.? ?
What can we conclude under these circumstances? We have to assume that the reluctance to hold provincial council elections is not about lacking confidence in the concept. It has to be, then, about the fear of losing.? ?
Those parties currently represented in Parliament don?t seem to be interesting in ?small elections?. Mangala?s tirades are about a presidential election. The President is making noises of a second term. The joint opposition or rather the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna seems to think that they?ve got the grassroots (following good showing at the local government elections) and therefore there?s no need to test waters; they are impatient to get the big prize.? ?
Now, whether or not one is ideologically committed to devolution, provincial councils and such, whether or not one is committed to the defeat of Devolutionazis and the abolition of the 13th Amendment and provincial councils, one has to acknowledge that the 13th Amendment still stands. One has to acknowledge that provincial councils exist. Thus, constitutionally and therefore legally, they need to be functional. Their functionality is dependent on one thing and one thing alone: Elections.? ?
The onus is on the Government to hold elections. Faizer Mustapha, the subject minister, appears to have gone into one of his sporadic long-naps on the matter. The Elections Commission is mandated to follow the relevant rule book. The Elections Commissioner has to ask the relevant questions from the Government and if necessary seek clarification from court regarding the matter.? ?
Mangala can fear Gotabaya. Mangala can entertain fears about his own political future. All yahapalana politicians can be terrified about going before the people after what happened on February 10, 2018. The Elections Commission need not be scared. It has a job to do. In fact, one might say that in a context where politicians are scared or pretending to be asleep, the only hope for those who want the relevant constitutional provisions affirmed, is the Elections Commission.? ?
Mr Mahinda Deshapriya, Sir, how about a media conference to clarify to the people the status of provincial council elections?? ?

## Title: Files on LTTE and MI5 in SL erased at UK Foreign Office
## Section: Breaking News

Files on LTTE and MI5 in SL erased at UK Foreign Office
	
Britain?s Foreign Office had destroyed almost 200 files on Sri Lanka dating from the start of the?LTTE?uprising during which MI5 (Military Intelligence, Section 5)?and the SAS (Special Air Service) secretly advised the country?s security forces, the Guardian reported on Wednesday.
It said the loss of the files means that there is almost no record of the British government?s work with the Sri Lankan authorities at the start of a famously brutal civil war.
The destruction of the files raises fresh concerns about the Foreign Office?s attitude towards handling historic files on sensitive subjects. An official review in 2012 found that the department had destroyed thousands of documents detailing British counter-insurgency operations in Kenya and other colonies as the empire came to an end.
Under the Public Records Act 1958 government departments are obliged to preserve historic records. But, in response to a Freedom of Information request from the Guardian asking for information about the destruction of the files, the Foreign Office stated that it was not required to preserve the documents. It said the files? content ?may be of a policy nature but might also be administrative or ephemeral?.
The Foreign Office has now confirmed that it destroyed 195 files on Sri Lanka, dating from 1978 to 1980, three decades after the country became independent from Britain. The department would not say exactly when, where, or how the destruction occurred.
?Files not selected for permanent preservation would have been destroyed offsite by the company contracted by the FCO for this purpose,? it said. ?We understand the files would have been destroyed in line with the FCO?s paper and file destruction contract in force at the time.?
Rachel Seoighe, a criminologist and Sri Lanka expert, at Middlesex University, said: ?This discovery is very concerning given the lack of public information available about British involvement in Sri Lankan security practices at the beginning of the civil war.? She has filed a complaint with Unesco, the international body that protects world heritage.
She added: ?We know from other contexts, such as Kenya, that official files have been deliberately destroyed to conceal and deny abuse. The public has a right to know the extent to which Britain assisted Sri Lankan preparations for a war that was defined by disappearances, torture and mass atrocity.?
The Foreign Office kept a list of file titles, showing that the destroyed papers would have covered a range of important subjects, from security co-operation and arms sales, to foreign aid and ?requests for political asylum in the UK?.
The scale of destruction is such that only three files have survived from 1978, compared to 38 files from the previous year.
The loss of these records is a blow for Tamil historians, who struggled to safeguard records throughout the Sri Lankan civil war. The famous Jaffna library was burnt down in 1981 by anti-Tamil groups, incinerating almost 100,000 documents including irreplaceable ancient texts.
?The Tamil community is taking strenuous efforts to collect and preserve records on history and the human rights situation in post-independence Sri Lanka,? said Vairamuttu Varadakumar, executive secretary of the Tamil Information Centre, in Kingston, London.
?We are horrified to learn that the UK?s Foreign Office has destroyed vital information on the British government?s training and arming of Sri Lankan security forces, which were involved in widespread human rights violations against the Tamils.?
The Foreign Office claim that the information contained in the files was insignificant has caused dismay among Tamil experts. Varadakumar said:
?It is improper for the UK government to deceive the public, who have the right to know. It appears that the Foreign Office?s action is designed to cover up the involvement of the SAS and MI5 in the training of Sri Lankan security forces that might be potentially embarrassing to her majesty?s government.?
The Special Air Service visit to Sri Lanka is only mentioned in a handful of surviving files at the National Archives, which were preserved by the Ministry of Defence. Their contents have never been reported on before.
One MoD file reveals that late in 1978 Sri Lanka?s right-wing president, Junius Richard Jayewardene, asked the Foreign Office for a British security expert to visit his country to help counter Tamil militants who were demanding an independent state of their own. However, a Foreign Office file called Sri Lanka: Security Assessment 1978, which could have shed light on the president?s request, was destroyed.
From the surviving defence files, it emerges that an MI5 director, who held racist views, made two advisory visits to Sri Lanka in 1979, under both Jim Callaghan?s Labour government and Margaret Thatcher?s Conservative administration. The full facts of these visits are hard to establish because the Foreign Office destroyed a 1979 file named Sri Lanka: Defence Visits from UK.
The MI5 officer was John Percival Morton CMG OBE, better known as Jack Morton, a former colonial police chief in India who had spied on the independence movement there and once wrote that Indians were ?a sort of immature, backward and needy people whom it was the natural British function to govern and administer?. He later became a director at MI5 and held various security positions inside Whitehall.
According to a defence file it was on Morton?s recommendation that an SAS team visited Sri Lanka in 1980 to train a new army commando unit.
Among the files destroyed by the Foreign Office was one entitled UK military assistance to Sri Lanka, 1980. The SAS visit occurred weeks after Britain?s premier special forces regiment staged the Iranian embassy siege. For the next four months the SAS team secretly trained Sri Lankan army commandos, selecting 60 members to form an elite anti-terrorist force.

JO deserves official Opposition in Parliament: Dullas
	
While saying that the Joint Opposition deserved the official Opposition in Parliament, Joint Opposition member and MP Dullas Alahapperuma said they hoped to meet Speaker Karu Jayasuriya to attain their rights.
Addressing a news briefing, he said today the Joint Opposition had further strengthened its power with the joining of the 16 Sri Lanka Freedom Party members to the Opposition.
?Our main objective is to cease the majority in the government. We have already done that with these 16 members. We will make use of that opportunity to weaken the government and defeat some illegal proposals that they have anticipated to bring in to Parliament in the future,? Alahapperuma said.
?The government has used its majority to pass some illegal proposals in the past like the Bill to introduce new electoral system for the Local Government polls in Parliament. But now the government is in hot water as it has lost its majority,? Alahapperuma added.
Meanwhile, he said the government was using an inefficient move to provide assistance to the people affected owing to the prevailing adverse weather conditions.
?The Government had turned a blind eye in distributing compensations to those affected due to the natural catastrophes in the near past. We urged the government to be efficient in this moment and provide compensation to those who were not provided,? Alahapperuma added. (Sheain Fernandopulle)

Mastercard Aims to Transform Sri Lanka?s Digital Payments Landscape with Mastercard QR
	
Mastercard unveiled Mastercard?s Merchant Presented QR payment solution in Sri Lanka, a safe and secure Quick Response (QR) based mobile payments solution. The solution enables shoppers to safely pay using a mobile application with a standardized QR code support to scan the merchant-presented QR code, which works on smartphones. Ushering in a new era for digital payments in the island nation, Mastercard QR can easily be integrated into existing mobile payment solutions offered by financial service providers and works with existing Mastercard cards as well.?
?Mastercard is excited to bring Mastercard QR to Sri Lanka, one of its key focus markets in South Asia. Continuing to support the country?s ongoing efforts to encourage adoption of cashless payments, Mastercard seeks to simplify access to digital payments for businesses and consumers through this fast, secure, convenient and cost-effective solution,? said R. B. Santosh Kumar, Country Manager, Sri Lanka and Maldives, Mastercard.
Mastercard QR enables merchants to accept Mastercard payments using a simple EMV Co standard QR code that merchants can display at their Point of Sale (POS) without the need for any physical equipment. They can also use a dynamic EMV Co QR code generated on the merchant?s mobile device. It is a low cost and easy-to-deploy technology, designed to benefit every merchant, whether they are based in a major city or a remote area. Thus, it opens up a world of opportunities to small and micro merchants across the country who are challenged by a traditional terminal approach for payments.
?The initial response on Mastercard QR from Mastercard's local customers and partners has been very encouraging. Mastercard is working together to integrate it into their existing systems. We look forward to seeing many more merchants and consumers availing the convenience and security of digital payments through solutions such as Mastercard QR,? added Santosh.
The release of the EMVCo QR Codes Specification in July 2017 has further propelled the proliferation of the interoperable QR Standards of QR Payments across Asia. These standards mean that merchants can now display a single QR code to accept different types of payments, and significantly simplifies the consumer and merchant experience in QR payments. Besides the successful launch in India in 2016, Mastercard is working closely with banks and non-banking financial service providers to roll this out in other countries like Thailand, Vietnam, Taiwan and Singapore.?

Merger of UNP and JVP with NGOs
	
Colloquial Sinhala is an exotic dialect when phrases are enunciated in the vernacular with the input of a smattering Anglo-Saxon linguistics that, leads to-?Broken English?. Sounds more the railcar ?burgher-ism? than an outpouring of intones from the Dutch Burgher Union.??
Parts of the 19th Amendment are on the verge of being dumped (by none other than Ranil?19A champ)
	JVP is juxtaposed between constitution making and their inadequate proficiency of the English language
	Who appointed Sripavan to the Board Room at the Commercial Bank (is it the Government nominees?)
	Every constitution needs a smart dick with a command of English to act as draftsmen
Parts of the 19th Amendment are on the verge of being dumped (by none other than Ranil?19A champ) stealthily with an eye on the Northern vote. Adversaries gave a rousing farewell in multiple languages to the chants of ?19A is down the pallam? [slippery slopes]. That?s pigeon?s droppings and/or a long drive from Suddha Sinhala.??
In a nutshell the JVP is juxtaposed between constitution making and their inadequate proficiency of the English language and is killing itself softly by overcoming language deficiencies by turning to the NGO/good governance disciples. They are taking the Sobhitha route without visiting the nearest temple ? like eating food with their feet.??
?Don?t blame Ranil too harshly ?point the finger at the Supreme Court under Justice Sripavan? gloomier than in the era of smart and silly Sarath Silva. Pronounced it constitutional without holding a referendum- by the ultimate dispassionate arbiter? The mother of all faults lies in depriving the people of their franchise for 4 1/2 years and having to watch a game of musical chairs enacted in Parliament, as Ministers shift chairs in the cabinet room. Who appointed Sripavan to the Board Room at the Commercial Bank (is it the Government nominees?) after the crisis that caused a nation disaster/whereas it required a 2/3 majority and a referendum the judgment allowed the Government to steam roll with a majority? Is it worth a Presidential Commission for the harm caused?? ?
Come 2020, does Tilvin or Vijitha know the finer or raw points in constitution making. They are not shy to deny much knowledge in English but here comes the howler
Clandestine operations are at hand - to re-work virtually the same script - by the same writers [good governance folk] in a fresh dressing led by the gang that contributed to the downfall of Mahinda Rajapakse in 2015; bringing forth the strategically splendid workmanship of Good Governance [GG]. It was a doctrine that was never to be functional! These kids seeking a place in the sun were treated flippantly by the present government after rendering yeoman service in setting the foundation for the electoral triumph. Shaken by inelegant hospitality they severed connections with the present government; now are on the mend by public recognition in becoming the constitution makers in ushering the 20 Amendment [20A]. It?s a reward for the good governance kids entrusted to produce such a premier legislation for the UNP via the JVP ? an empty paper that creates no impact - will never see light a the end of the tunnel - as no government will dare to bring forth a bagful of muck with an election too close. Bottom line is that the JVP cannot write good English. Fortunately they know it and the upper echelons of government is not their route to achieve their aspirations. Limitations ? JVP are aware, makes them good fodder for lesser office in our lifetime. The draft of 2015 is a historical record for Ranil?s posterity ? legacy that smells defeat at the polls whoever propels it. None will, as it remains a JVP born in a union with Ranil.? ?
In a well-coordinated move, the UNP handed the constitutional assignment to the JVP, whose knowledge of English is miniscule? Beggars cannot be choosers; limitations are such, encountered in not knowing English - is an inherent defect in the JVP. Let them find wordsmiths to do better than the work that one man did for the19A. Surely not to be alienated to NGOs? Were they always part of the circus, one wonders???
Such material is not easy to find. Every constitution needs a smart dick with a command of English to act as draftsmen. In 1972 Mrs. Bandaranaike had Colvin R. de Silva and H.L. de Silva; In 1978 J.R. Jayawardane carried brilliant Mark Fernando and able L.C. Seneviratne. Whom did Ranil & Sirisena turn to in seeking advice on the Constitution 2015 - one Jayampathy Wickremaratne emerged a holder of a good certificate issued under the hand of Sarath Silva (If his certificate is of a credible value in the jolly days of Chandrika? if so, JW is indeed a good choice). Come 2020, does Tilvin or Vijitha know the finer or raw points in constitution making. They are not shy to deny much knowledge in English but here comes the howler. They entrusted the assignment to the good governance kids that know a smattering of English but nothing more. Blind leads the blind.??
Where have all the good and great UNP lawyers gone? Not gone to seed, surely. Lesser are making the bucks over time, overnight. Others to Commissions and Committees, few to Ministries. Really good and genuine, and indeed the great are at home not hogging the limelight. It is just that ?Ranil and his Merry Men? cannot distinguish the good from the bad.??

Navy alerted as water level of Diyawanna Oya rises
	
The Navy was being kept in readiness following a warning issued to Speaker Karu Jayasuriya by Minister of Western Development and Megapolis Patali Champika Ranawaka that the Parliamentary complex might go under water if the water levels of the Diyawanna Oya rises further.
Sources close to Speaker Jayasuriya said that Minister Ranawaka had raised this on Sunday (20).
The minister had told the Speaker that the Parliamentary complex and houses in the vicinity might get submerged if the rain continues to pour causing the water levels of the Diyawanna Oya to rise. However, sources said the risk is less to some extent as Colombo and its suburbs have not received a heavy rainfall yesterday. ?We have kept a team of naval officers on alert as a precautionary measure,? the sources said.
The Parliamentary complex had gone under water s a result of torrential rains in 1992 and in 2010 while there was also a close call in 2016.? (Yohan Perera and Ajith Siriwardana)

New dress code for pregnant teachers
	
The Education Ministry has introduced a special dress code for expectant teachers from today based on a decision taken by Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam
?Pregnant teachers wore the traditional saree to school even during advanced stages of pregnancy and this will be very uncomfortable and not suitable in such situations,? the minister said.
Doctors had informed the minister about the need to provide a convenient dress code for pregnant teachers and this resulted in the minister directing the relevant authorities to introduce a comfortable dress code during pregnancy.
The inaugural programme countrywide will be held tomorrow under the patronage of the Education Minister.
The Education Ministry said there were 236,000 teachers in Sri Lanka with a majority of them being female and 10,000 teachers apply for maternity leave annually. (Chaturanga Samarawickrama)

PM will inform on PC Polls soon: Speaker
	
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya yesterday informed Parliament that Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe would inform Parliament this week about the decision on the Provincial Council Elections.
He said this in response to an allegation made by Joint Opposition MP Dullas Allahapperuma that the Government was trying to evade Provincial Council Elections by delaying them despite the Supreme Court ruling against such moves by the Government.
He told Parliament that elections to three Provincial Councils had been delayed by eight months, while the term of three other was expiring in four months.
He said the Prime Minister had earlier assured the House that the Delimitation Report would be presented in Parliament in March debate it and hold the elections soon
?But no action had been taken so far,? he said.
?Provincial Councils and Local Government minister Faiszer Mustapha tabled the Delimitation Report on March 8. It was included in the Order Paper on March 22 and May 22 to be debated in Parliament, but the Government evaded the debate on both days,? he said.
Speaker Jayasuriya said on Monday he discussed the holding of the PC elections with the Prime Minister and that the Premier had informed him that the matter should be discussed with the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP).
Joint Opposition group leader Dinesh Gunawardane said the Supreme Court had ruled that elections could not be postponed without a referendum and added that the Speaker would have to face allegations of violating the Constitution if failed to act according to the constitution.
?Provincial Councils are part of the Constitution, unlike the Local Government Bodies. It is a violation of the Constitution not acting according to the Constitution,? he said. (Ajith Siriwardana and Yohan Perera)

?President doesn?t want me  to step down? -Thilanga Sumathipala
	
Uduwatuwage Janath Priya Thilanga Sumathipala tendered his resignation as the Deputy Speaker of Parliament last month after voting in favour of the no-confidence motion against Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe. Sumathipala, who is also the Incumbent President of Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC), is contesting the upcoming SLC Elections seeking re-election. In an interview with the Daily Mirror, Sumathipala aired his views on the dramatic political scenarios and crossovers, his thoughts on resuming work in the capacity of Deputy Speaker, SLFP?s future and Cricket.?
?
Excerpts:
My political strength has been a huge advantage for the SLC
	I don?t have a moral right to remain in the Government now
	Whoever wants to be the next President needs?SLFP support
Q Discussions and arguments on curtailing Executive power have again surfaced. Where does the SLFP stand regarding this matter?
The SLFP doesn?t stand exactly where the UNP stands regarding this matter. The SLFP stands firm that there has to be a directly elected President in this country. The power of the President has significantly lessened by now. From the next President onwards, there can?t be any ministry portfolios assigned to the President except the post of State Minister of Defence. It is believed that the Presidential system is good in order to maintain the country?s sovereignty. If executive power is subject to major changes, it will eventually create a political situation tantamount to a federal system.?
Q Are you going to resume duties as the Deputy Speaker of Parliament?
I tendered my resignation after I along with several other SLFP Ministers and Parliamentarians, including S.B. Dissanayake, Susil Premajayantha, Dayasiri Jayasekara and W.D.J. Senaviratne voted in favour of the no-confidence motion against Premier Ranil Wickremesinghe last month. I have informed President Maithripala Sirisena that I want to sit in the Opposition. The President doesn?t want me to step down. For the moment, he is not in agreement with my decision. He requested me to continue as the Deputy Speaker of Parliament despite my decision to step down from the post. I will soon make my final decision after another meeting with the President.?
The two main leaders aren?t blending well in this national Government
?
Q You voted for the removal of Prime Minister Wickremesinghe with whom you are going to have to work again if you decide to resume your duties as the Deputy Speaker. How morally appropriate is it for you to serve under his Government now?
Of course, I believe that I don?t have a moral right to remain in the Government now. My wish now is to play my political role sitting in the Opposition.?
Q Then, why are you having second thoughts about your decision to resign?
I had lost my electorate. I came to the Parliament through the national list. If I had won at the elections, I would have taken the decision to resign without having second thoughts. But now, I have a moral obligation not to go against President Sirisena?s word since I was brought into the Parliament on the wishes of the President and through the national list. I believe that I have to consult the President who is my leader before making a decision that affects my political future.
Q Don?t you see any difficulty in resuming duties as the Deputy Speaker?
None at all. I don?t see any problem nor a barricade preventing me from remaining in my post and chairing the Parliament in future. Even the JVP MP Sunil Handunnetti voted against the Prime Minister. Yet, he is still COPE Chairman.
Q UNP Minsters were contemplating on bringing a no-confidence motion against you. What are your comments?
The Government expects me as the Deputy Speaker to take their side when making decisions. But, when an impartial order is given by the Deputy Speaker, the majority of MPs will demand my removal. That was my party?s decision to vote in favour of the no-confidence motion which was brought against the Prime Minister. Unlike the others, for me the party is the priority. I had to follow my party?s decision. Some SLFP MPs abstained from voting. Not a single SLFPer supported the Prime Minister during the no-faith motion. However, I was elected to the post by the Parliament on September 1, 2015 even before the formation of the National Government. Once the Speaker, Deputy Speaker and Chairman of Committees are appointed by the Parliament, they cannot be removed through resolutions unless they resign as members of the Parliament. As per the Constitution, resignation letters should be tendered not to anyone else, but to the Head of the State; President Maithripala Sirisena.
Q Some UNP ministers affirmed that the Deputy Speaker of Parliament should be unbiased and impartial when taking important decisions within the four corners on the Parliament. Do you think you acted in such manner?
Of course, within the Parliament I have to be very impartial in my decisions. But, all these Parliamentarians are from some political party. Even the Speaker is from the UNP. Since 1972, the Speaker of the Parliament of Sri Lanka was appointed outside the Parliament. But, the current situation is different. W.J.M. Lokubandara and Anura Bandaranaike came from the Opposition and later served as the Speaker. The present Deputy Chairman of Committees is from the TNA. It isn?t about where we come from, but what we do when we are given power in the relevant positions.
Q Your attempt to remove the Prime Minister wasn?t successful. Due to the unsuccessful attempt, many SLFP ministers had to lose their minister portfolios. Any comments?
Our party officially asked him to step down. Even the President wanted him (Wickremesinghe) to step down. But, he did not bother to heed our calls. Since he has shown that he has the support of the majority in Parliament, now he should be allowed to continue. Outside the Parliament there are more serious challenges awaiting him which include; a collapsing economy, the TNA and his agreements with it, the political stability of the Government using UPFA support and the stability of his own party.
Moreover, the general public was concerned about law and order and the cost of living. On the other hand, investments are also not taking place. Small and medium industries aren?t really happy with the Government since money circulation has been severely affected due to tax policies and the new tax reforms. Under this Government, more pressure has been put on local industries. Therefore, they would rather deposit their money instead of investmenting it. The severe effect on money circulation has also impacted the import and export chain. This isn?t the only country available for investors to make investments. If we don?t offer more than what other potential countries are offering, investors become reluctant to invest here. The deduction of personal taxes isn?t going to help the society. In my opinion, corporate tax has to be reduced.?
Q What do you see as the biggest challenge the Unity Government is unable to overcome?
When it comes to the stability of the National Government, the two main leaders aren?t blending well, especially when nationally important decisions are taken. Some of these decisions were connected to constitutional changes, changes to the President?s executive power, devolution of power and electoral reforms. It?s obvious that there is no consensus between the two ruling parties, the UNP and the SLFP.? However, the Government can continue during the remaining two years since it cannot be dissolved without a two-third majority, obtaining of which is now remote. When core values are not being addressed properly, it looks like we are all pursuing our political ambitions rather than making good governance work.
He is no longer the Malinga whom we?used to see
Q During the last Local Government Elections the SLFP experienced a significant drop in popularity. Do you think the party could be brought back to the old position? How?
Definitely. That is my main concern and where my commitment lies right now. We have to rebuild our esteemed party. The SLFP is the leading left party in Sri Lanka. We should not at any cost let it go. Our primary objective is to rebuild our grand old party. The SLFP lost its vote base because its members joined hands with the UNP. As repercussions, for every bad decision taken by the Government, the blame is palmed on the SLFP, even if the SLFP has made no contribution to a particular situation.?
The SLFP and the UNP can never work together. We missed the bus! When we had the two-third majority, we could have changed the Constitution without going for a referendum. The past two and half years have not been put to best use in making Constitutional amendments. The Government doesn?t even have the proper two third majority which means it is not easy for any Constitutional changes to come by.?
If the SLFP leaves the Government now and runs independently, I am very confident that we will regain our voters and lost popularity. Meanwhile, we are currently working on a new policy framework with regard to the party. We are planning to introduce reforms to the SLFP Constitution before the September 2 Party Convention in order to revive the party. We have realized that the general public is not very frustrated. It is high time they demand a professional political approach. I am sure the SLFP can offer it. Neither the UNP nor the SLPP is in the middle path of approaching matters. Whoever wants to be the next President , needs SLFP?s support. We are the ones who are going to decide who will be the best person to do a better job and transform Sri Lanka into a better place. We will be the most influential party in deciding who should be the best candidate.
Q How ethical is it for a politician to be the head of Sri Lanka Cricket??
A number of politicians including Gamini Disssnayake, Tyrone Fernando, N.M.Perera and J.R.Jayewardene served as presidents of SLC. Although many aren?t aware I was a first class cricket player while in school. I was the Vice Captain of my school cricket team. I have lived a life associated with cricket. Not only that I entered politics after becoming SLC President. I was able to bring finances into the SLC because of the negotiations I personally had with Government institutes. Therefore, my political strength has been a huge advantage for the SLC.?
Q You as SLC President are very confident about being reelected. Isn?t there a conflict of interest since there are allegations that you have connections with the gaming industry?
This is the same allegations levelled against me by those who are outside the gate of the SLC and cannot win at the SLC Elections. Their ultimate goal is to sling mud at me. I don?t have any direct connections with betting industry. I have already disclosed my assets and income in Parliament. I am free to be a part of the SLC. As far as I am concerned, there is no such conflict of interest.
Q There has been public criticism demanding your resignation as? SLC President after the Sri Lankan team experienced losses repeatedly. Still, you are contesting for another term. Don?t you care about the demands of people?
As the President of SLC, obviously I am also not happy with the performance of the team. I know that our team is better than what the rankings indicate. With the best coach possible, Hathurusinghe, offering his services, we are rectifying all shortcomings. Attention has to be paid to the T20 matches.?
Q How confident are you that you will get re-elected as the SLC President?
People are with me. I am so popular among the SLC staffers. People want me back. I have got plenty of support within my institution. I don?t think that there is a contestant who is able to beat me.?
Q If elected, what will be your plans for the next ICC World Cup?
Sri Lankan team has a very good chance of winning the upcoming World Cup. Our players are slowly peaking. Support will be given to the head coach to make sure we are consistent.?
The SLC is now in a very strong financial position. We have over two billion rupees in the reserve. The highest ever annual revenue in SLC history (six million rupees) was made during last year. I have given a directive to increase the salaries of our cricketers by 34 percent so that it will serve as motivation and encouragement.?
Ranjan Ramanayakeis just a film star
Q On the subject of wasting money, Deputy Minister Ranjan Ramanayake recently exposed corruption and waste allegedly taking place at SLC during past two years. Are you aware of those allegations and are they true?
Who is Ranjan Ramanayake? What does he know about cricket? He is just a film star. He is desperately trying to seek attention and popularity by talking about cricket. Ranjan is a politician who says things which are not substantial. He doesn?t understand law. The SLC is an institution which comes under the observation of the Government Auditor General?s Department. Has he (Ranjan) ever run at least a small boutique? It is a known fact that people connected with the film industry are used by others to fulfill their agendas. Those who are going behind Ranjan are disgruntled.??
Q What kind of support do you think you would garner from the new Minister of Sports Faiszer Musthapha?
Mr. Musthapha is a very intelligent President?s Counsel. He completely understands the Sports Law. Having him is a huge strength for us. His approach is different to Former Sports Minister Dayasiri?s. Minister Musthapha is inclined towards policy level not the operational level. We will have to wait and see how he is going to handle the affairs. So far, he has been very supportive of me.
Q Lasith Malinga who was the highest T20 wicket taker was dropped for the Nidahas Trophy during which our team failed to enter the final. What really happened to him?
The selectors have no confidence in him at the moment. What is our future with him? I don?t think he would play in the upcoming ICC World Cup.?
Q Why have selectors lost confidence in him?
He doesn?t have the speed in his bowling like in the past. Therefore, the selectors aren?t very happy with him. I gave him seven matches and he was giving away a lot of runs. In our hearts Malinga is a brilliant player. He is not even playing in the domestic tournament in India. He was dropped from the IPL this time. How can we have in the national side a player who does not have a place in a domestic team? It shows that he is no longer the Malinga whom we used to see and love. But, we should not forget his services.?
Q? He has recently said that he wants to make a comeback. Your comments?
Maybe he wants to play again. We cannot deprive another young player the chance by opting for Malinga. He is now 34-years-old. Every player has to understand that one day he has to leave the game. Unless he comes and attends practices, plays in some national or international level Cricket tournaments and performs, the selectors are not willing to give him a chance.
Q Recently, former Sri Lanka Cricket Captain Kumar Sangakkara said that the SLC Constitution should be changed. Do you see the need for a big change in the SLC Constitution?
As every Constitution needs change with the passing of time, this theory is relevant to the SLC as well. Minister Musthapha told me that he wants the SLC to appoint selectors. Nowhere in the world, does a politician approve the team and selectors. The Minister said that the Sports Law has to be changed. We will discuss about these changes in the future. I am sure Sangakkara will have good ideas that can be implemented if the SLC Constitution undergoes changes.?

Presidential Elections Both sides saddled  with challenges in deciding on candidates
	
A momentum has built up in view of the next presidential election though it is not yet around the corner. The recent ?Viyath Maga? programme, a confab of intellectuals, business leaders and politicians with a nationalist bent, served as the virtual launching pad of a presidential election campaign.??
A premature poll campaign is now in the making in that sense, though the elections are scheduled to be conducted at the end of next year, as per the Constitution
	The experiment of a common candidate was successful in 2015
	Many believe former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa who chaired the Viyath Maga programmme would be the chosen presidential candidate
A premature poll campaign is now in the making in that sense, though the elections are scheduled to be conducted at the end of next year, as per the Constitution. But, a premature enthusiasm, created in this manner, has resulted in the two opposing political camps volleying charges against each other, targeting the individual personalities of likely candidates.??
For the anti-government political force, many believe former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa who chaired the Viyath Maga programmme would be the chosen presidential candidate. As such, he is subjected to early political assaults by those in the government, averse to his possible candidacy.? ?
The candidate from the UNP-led political force is not yet identified though a couple of Ministers insisted that it should be none other than Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe. Whoever it may be, the UNP candidate is still aloof from political vilification because he is not yet identified in the broader sense.? ?
After the Viyath Maga programme, Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera was the first to make a detailed response to the event, in fact, calling it ?Vipath Maga? (path of destruction). Now the stage is set for political debate on the presidential election in this manner. And, some people, eagerly awaiting a presidential poll, keep posting on the social media sites, expressing themselves.? ?
Be that as it may, either political camp is saddled with issues in deciding on the candidate. As far, the political forces led by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa are concerned, some leaders have publicly uttered that Gotabhaya Rajapaksa should be the candidate while the others such as MP Vasudeva Nanayakkara proposed former Speaker Chamal Rajapaksa to candidacy. It is rumoured that former Minister Basil Rajapaksa also harbours presidential ambition in this regard. Nevertheless, no one has made any public announcement to that effect.??
So, for that matter, the forces aligned with the Joint Opposition have to reconcile differences before deciding on the next candidate. According to political sources from the Joint Opposition, certain MPs such as Wimal Weerawansa, Udaya Gammanpila and Bandula Gunawardane remain adamant that it should be Gotabhaya Rajapaksa who should seek presidency.??
For the UNP, it is a challenging situation this time. Last time, the UNP forged ties with the political parties, groups and individuals with diverse opinions to field President Maithripala Sirisena as the common candidate. It was done for a purpose. The experiment of a common candidate was successful in 2015 in this manner. Those who stood together, had a set of targets to be achieved. In retrospect, these targets could not be realized. As such, it is now a challenging task to unite all those parties, groups and individuals again for the concept of common candidate, which was tested and failed in the opinion of those who stood for it. It is, therefore, a herculean task for the UNP-led political camp to unify all the forces for a common candidate. If it is difficult, the party will be compelled to field its own candidate. Against the backdrop, both the sides have issues to be resolved in deciding on their best bets for the presidential election. Alongside, there are those with presidential ambitions serving in the UNP at the moment.? ?
SLPP skeptical about SLFP move?
There is a new dimension to opposition politics hitherto led by the Joint Opposition, after 16 MPs of Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) left the government and decided to sit in the opposition. The group, functioning as a separate group in the opposition, launches frontal attacks on the UNP-led government. As such, opposition politics, so far dominated by the Joint Opposition as the main force opposed to the UNP, is sought to be shared by the SLFP group.? ?
This has irked some members of the Joint Opposition, particularly those having links with Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP). They perceive this as a ruse by the SLFP to carve out its niche in the collective public opinion building up against the government. Actually, President Maithripala Sirisena gave his blessings to this group to sit in the opposition though his party has not officially decided to quit the unity government with the UNP. The President, it seems, has understood that his party was relegated to a poor third at the local government elections on February 10 because of its alignment with the UNP in the unity government for the last couple of years. The SLFP is now planning to decide as a party to leave the government. Yet, it is questionable how far the SLFP will succeed in efforts to emerge as a formidable force to reckon with, in the opposition.? ?
The SLPP, which won the local polls, is skeptical about the move by the SLFP group. The SLPP also faces pressure from its rank and file not to accommodate these SLFPers. As such, its chairman Prof. G.L. Peiris announced at a press conference that it would contest all future elections under its lotus bud symbol and the leadership of the former President. He tried to drive home the message that the SLFP, if it wanted, could become a party to a broad alliance led by the SLPP under the lotus bud symbol in the future. In other words, the SLFP can only become an appendage to the SLPP at future elections.? ?
Those who stood together, had a set of targets to be achieved. In retrospect, these targets could not be realized. As such, it is now a challenging task to unite all those parties, groups and individuals again for the concept of common candidate
Talks are actually underway for such a broad electoral front in the future. In a step towards this, the group was to meet with former President Rajapaksa last evening.? ?
In the meantime, the leaders of the political parties in the Joint Opposition met with Mr. Mahinda Rajapaksa to discuss, among others, steps for a series of protest rallies against the government. The Joint Opposition will mount such a campaign to protest against the government over the rising cost of living, the fuel price revision, the postponement of the Provincial Council Elections etc.? ?
Amidst talks about the possible candidates for the next presidential elections, the public attention is being drawn to another move - the exercise to abolish the executive presidency.? ?
The JVP, a party commanding the support of six MPs, is working it out to be presented to Parliament as a private member?s bill.? ?
It is learnt that the bill is drafted in collusion with some in the government. The end target of this exercise is to avoid the next presidential election, enabling the election of the President through Parliament only.??
The country is experiencing a unique political development in that sense. On one hand, there is enthusiasm for the presidential election in some quarters. On the other hand, efforts are underway to abolish the executive presidency.? ?

Star Grade hotels inspected by CMC
	
Municipality?s Chief Medical Officer Dr Ruwan Wijayamuni has instructed the PHIs to inspect the hotels for their food hygiene standards.
Speaking to the Daily Mirror, Medical Officer of Health (Central Colombo) Dr Subash Mendis said most of the hotels were found with minor incidents of food safety regulation violations.
?The hotels were inspected for food hygiene standards, including food preparations, freezer room conditions, garbage control, pest control and food labelling.
?Some hotels have not labelled food items, which were placed in freezers. The date of preparation and the date of expiry should be mentioned in these food items,? he said.
He said the Health Department had informed the management of these hotels about the violations of food safety regulations found in the hotels.
Dr Mendis said Chief Medical Officer Dr Wijayamuni had instructed to conduct more such hotel inspections next week as well.
A team of health officials including Dr Mendis, Chief Food Inspector Lal Kumara and a number of Public Health Inspectors (PHI) inspected the hotels yesterday under the instructions and guidance of Chief Medical Officer Dr Wijayamuni. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Towards ?jana? and away from ?janaya?
	
When Jothipala died somewhere in 1987, people wept. His funeral, like the funeral of Rukmani Devi years earlier, was attended by thousands of fans, who braved the soon-to-erupt JVP-UNP bheeshanaya. If we are to assess the worth of a singer on the basis of how prabuddha (highbrow) he is, then there?s nothing to help us rationalise why so many could weep at this particular singer?s funeral. And yet, many did weep. So many, in fact, that after the funeral no less a person than Sarath Amunugama wrote an article on what he termed as the ?janapriya sanskruthiya?, where he implied that Jothipala, despite his pandering to populist sentiments, had emerged as a singer of the nation. Having read this essay, Nalin de Silva, by his own admission an admirer of the ?prabuddha sanksruthiya? back then, wrote a reply demeaning Amunugama?s stance and explicitly batting for the culture that was opposed to these populist sentiments. Decades later, having repented and turned around as the face of the Jathika Chinthanaya, de Silva eschewed his fascination with the highbrow culture and penned the following: ?When Jothipala died, thousands of fans flocked to Kanatte and no ?prabhuddha? artiste had ever been respected by so many people at his/her funeral.? It took no less a figure than Amaradeva, the de facto symbol of that prabuddha sensibility here, to compel the same outflow of grief at his passing away.??
The novels of Martin Wickramasinghe, the songs of Amaradeva, and the films of Lester James Peries belong squarely to the first and second of these movements
Clement Greenberg?s analysis of art and non art doesn?t hold much water in Sri Lanka because, as with all colonial societies, we never made the transition from art to kitsch through an intermediate stage; we just transited from the one to the other. As such, instead of art and kitsch, we have what we can broadly term as ?jana? on the one hand and ?janapriya? on the other. Both these cultural sensibilities, as I wrote last week, neglected the folk culture, the culture regenerated by the efforts of Lionel and Sahan Ranwala as well as the likes of Piyasiri Wijeratne and Rohana Baddage. Rationalising this split requires an explication of how, and why, jana and janapriya remain wedded to each other, as strands of one holistic sensibility, and how and why the folk culture, when it evolved into the formal culture, had to waste away half its essence to the dust in a bid to appeal to mass or elite audiences. Was it because of the fact, which holds valid in virtually every society, that once you attempt to preserve folk art forms through a process of refinement, you inevitably contort those same art forms? And if so, does that explain why Jothipala and Amaradeva occupy the same pedestal, though from opposite ends???
The art forms which evolved after 1956 were smeared, necessarily, by the three art movements the Western world brought out in the 20th century: realism and naturalism, modernism, and postmodernism. The novels of Martin Wickramasinghe, the songs of Amaradeva, and the films of Lester James Peries belong squarely to the first and second of these movements. Out of these pioneers only Martin Wickramasinghe tried to go beyond their confines and parameters, and while Bawatharanaya (his last) is considered a lesser work, as a blatant act of depicting the Buddha the same way Nikos Kazantzakis depicted Christ (?The Last Temptation? was published around the time Wickramasinghe was writing Viragaya), it nevertheless attempted to go beyond the limits of modernism. In as much as these artistes discovered a way through which the folk culture could be communicated to lay audiences, they ended up forming a substantial fan base among the milieu aspiring to become a petty bourgeoisie: as a result of free education and the social mobility it enabled among this milieu, the patrons of the Amaradevas and the Perieses and the Chitrasenas came from a bilingual, half-sophisticated crowd. Preservation of the folk culture, at the hands of this crowd, required Westernisation and Sanskritisation.??
In the early days, it was the offspring of these lackeys who idealised the folk culture, the peasantry, and tried their hand at preserving folk art forms no matter how imperfect their attempts were. Devar Surya Sena, formerly Herbert Charles Jacob Peiris, son of Sir James Peiris (the first non-European to be appointed President of the Cambridge Union), was the first of these offspring. They came from the Anglican elite, and in their efforts at spawning a national consciousness, they found a meaning for their own uprooted lives.??
The generation of Amaradeva and Chitrasena came from a more intermediate social milieu, which belonged at once to both the formal and the folk and yet was at home with neither. They were affluent, but not affluent enough to rake up the sort of leisure and privilege essential for the formation of a refined cultural sensibility. The groundwork laid down by the likes of Sena proved to be crucial to them, and what they had discovered, the petty bourgeoisie added to. But what Sena and Rajapakse lacked, as their recordings of songs we mistakenly allude to as Sinhalese and Buddhist today (?Danno Budunge?) indicate, was the requisite Sinhala-ness to strike a chord with popular audiences. The petty bourgeoisie, at once linked to and disdainful of the peasantry, found their icons with a set of artists who could leap over this limitation. They could not go back to the village, nor could they completely turn away from it. This at times contradictory streak is what makes up much of our cultural revolution, from the 1940s and 50s onwards.??

Trump cancels meeting with Kim Jong-un
	
US President Donald Trump has cancelled his planned summit with the North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, blaming his decision on a threatening statement from the North Korean regime, the Guardian reported.
In a formal letter to Kim released by the White House, Trump said he had been ?very much looking forward? to the summit in Singapore on 12 June.
But he wrote: ?Sadly, based on the tremendous anger and open hostility displayed in your most recent statement, I feel it is inappropriate, at this time, to have this long-planned meeting.?
Trump declared that the meeting would not take place ?for the good of both parties, but to the detriment of the world.
?You talk about your nuclear capabilities, but ours are so massive that I pray to God they will never have to be used,?
The president?s change of mind appeared to have been sudden and recent.
In an interview recorded on Wednesday and broadcast on Thursday morning on Fox News, Trump had offered a concession to North Korea, saying he could accept a phased disarmament, contradicting his own top foreign policy officials.
The about-face followed a strongly worded statement by North Korea?s vice-foreign minister Choe Son-hui, which in turn was a response to hardline comments by US vice-president Mike Pence.
In her statement, Choe warned that Pyongyang could make the US ?taste an appalling tragedy?.
If the talks are cancelled, Choe suggested the two countries could engage in a ?nuclear-to-nuclear showdown?.
She said: ?Whether the US will meet us at a meeting room or encounter us at nuclear-to-nuclear showdown is entirely dependent upon the decision ? of the US. We will neither beg the US for dialogue nor take the trouble to persuade them if they do not want to sit together with us.?

## Title: UNFAIR  BUS FAres Do passengers deserve a fare hike for poor service?
## Section: News Features

UNFAIR  BUS FAres Do passengers deserve a fare hike for poor service?
	
After much deliberation, the Cabinet of Ministers on Tuesday approved a 12.5% bus fare hike, with the minimum bus fare now becoming Rs.12 for the first segment of the journey. Deputy Minister of Transport Ashoka Abeysinghe assured the public that approval for this hike was granted on the condition that there would be no bus fare increase for the next two years.? ?
Stakeholders of the transport sector held opposing views over the matter. The Inter-Provincial Private Bus Association stated that the revision was satisfactory, even though their initial request was for a 15% increase in the bus fare. Meanwhile the Lanka Private Bus Owners? Association charged that the increment would lead to a total collapse of the national policy on bus fare increments as it would only serve as a short term benefit. The Association was referring to the condition that there would be no fare hikes for the next two years.? ?
While the stakeholders debated the rationale behind the increase, the?Daily Mirror queried from the public about their views on the public transportation sector. We asked consumer rights activists, passengers and daily commuters about their experiences, if they were aware of passenger rights and if the bus fare hike was justifiable in terms of the service they receive.? ?
?
- Ranjith Vithanage
Chairman of the National Movement for Consumer Rights Protection
?As passengers we are completely against this price hike. There is an accepted and established national policy on bus fares, which is usually revised in July. This move to raise the bus fares from 6.5% to 12.5% is simply absurd,? Vithanage said.? ?
He charged that authorities are busy playing to the audiences of bus operators rather than serving the commuter. ?It is baffling as to why the Minister of Transport was not involved in this matter while only the Deputy Minister was involved in all the discussions held with bus operators. The people?s concerns were rejected and the Minister tabled this move in the Cabinet simply to satisfy certain operators. Several prominent bus operators meanwhile even rejected this decision,? he alleged.? ?
?A Cabinet paper was tabled in an unusual manner to make this fare hike possible. There are 12 indexes to be considered when raising bus fares and fares cannot be raised according to the whims and fancies of certain groups. There was only a possibility or raising the fare to 9%. There was no need to raise the minimum fare just because the fuel price changed, which is only one of the 12 indexes. If the authorities cannot abide by the policies, there is in fact no need for a National Transport Commission,? Vithanage opined.? ?
?SLTB buses more reliable?
?- Dulani Yapa, Kandy?
I would totally avoid taking mass transport offered by the private sector if there are Sri Lanka Transport Board buses in the vicinity. The state service is much better compared to private buses, in terms of discipline, dispensing change and especially not playing loud music. Usually the state service buses offers the passenger room to breathe.? ?
?
?
?No other option??
-Sash Ranasinghe Kurunegala? ? ?
Using public transport is like committing suicide. But since we have no other option we have to? tolerate all these tribulations. Very recently my mother met with an accident due to a private bus driver?s reckless driving.? ?
?Attitudes differ but most drivers reckless??
- Hasitha Fernando, Tellippalai?
A vast majority of the bus crew are unruly and complete with rude conductors whose only intention is to pack their respective vehicle with as much passengers as possible. (Think sardines packed in a tin) The sole purpose of the driver of their vehicle is to overtake, over-run their competition to get to the next bus stop before the other bus. On occasion though there are a few kind conductors and careful drivers but these are only a handful. In the North of the country, there is a difference in the overall passenger experience. The conductors are kinder. But the drivers are still reckless. They just honk their horn loudly which only makes the experience more nauseating for the passenger, especially with the loud music.? ?
?Harassed by nauseating music??
- Kovida Bakmeedeniya, Rajagiriya?
Generally sounds over 85 decibels for more than 30 minutes cause ear damage. I have not measured this, but I am sure the loud music and the radio programmes blaring in the passenger?s ear at any given time, is not only harassment, but causes ear damage.? This is especially true when travelling towards home after work. I usually get down with ringing in my ears and absolute disgust of the taste of music these people have. Once a lady in the bus complained and asked the conductor to lower the volume, to no avail.? ??
?A struggle for survival??
- Nathasha Narampanawa, Peradeniya?
Getting to work and coming back home alive is a struggle for survival simply because of the state of transport in Sri Lanka. Drivers, be it a bus driver or a tuk driver, often do not have any regard for the well-being or emotional state of passengers. Recently, I was in a bus that was racing from Peradeniya to Kandy, and only slowed down when the husband of a pregnant passenger went up to the driver to complain. We are supposed to move in seconds and dive out of buses when they slow down at the bus halt, just to avoid being scolded by the conductor. I have witnessed many accidents because passengers are pressured to get down like this and I think many of us can relate to this experience.? ?
?Policy makers never use public transport?
- Danushka Alahakoon, Dehiwala? ??
We?re harassed by loud music on most days. Even if we complain to reduce or mute the music they don?t really pay attention to our requests. Policy makers never use public transport and that is probably why they don?t understand what the general population goes through every day. However when I recently called 1955, the hotline to lodge complaints about buses, they responded well saying that swift action would be taken. At least the hotline seems efficient.? ?
?
?Prefer trains over buses?
?- Devaka Perera,?Kandy
I think bus fares should be raised on a specific pricing formula. There is nothing much to talk about our rights when asking for the Rs. 1 balance is not worth the nagging from the bus conductors. I prefer travelling by train over buses. I can book my seat and have reasonable leg space. And it?s more convenient to avoid traffic rather than sit through it and witness all sorts of traffic violations and listening to the loud music. Nobody will bother to take their personal vehicle if there is a comfortable and reliable public transport system.? ?
?
?Hikes justified if comforts provided?
- Heshan Welgolle, Maharagama? ?
Passengers have no rights in Sri Lanka. I travel to office daily by train as it is the fastest mode of transport and is very economical. But the government should take matters into their hands to resurrect a dead public transport service. It is very rarely that even trains work on schedule. There are delays at least twice a week. I? have experienced delays ranging from 30 minutes to 3 hours. Imagine being stuck in a confined place until you reach the next stop? Windows are closed when it rains, fans never work. People faint due to lack of oxygen.? ?
I have used public transportation in foreign countries where you buy a card, swipe it and reach your destination. Top up the amount up when you want to. In Sri Lanka, the queue to buy tickets, to renew the monthly season, let alone the process of obtaining a monthly season pass is absurd. I had to go to studios to get photographs, get them certified by a JP and apply and wait for 3 months to receive a passport like book, which I can?t even slip in my wallet. Why can?t we use a reusable card? Is it so hard to maintain such a time saving service? And there is no authority to monitor patterns on these public transport services. It is totally worth increasing the price of services if proper comforts are provided to the passenger. It is a complete waste of productive time and energy? ?
Many people we spoke to were of the opinion that passengers have no rights in Sri Lanka and that the fare hike was not justified in par with the service and comfort they receive. Commuters also highlighted the need to upgrade the railway service to compliment the bus network, while some others pointed out that policy makers need to experience the ground situation in order to restore and revive the public transportation system in the country.? ?
It is imperative to note that the absence of a prudent fare policy has given way to many issues in the industry, resulting in the deterioration of the overall quality of service.?With the nature of public transport directly affecting socio-economic activities of the country, the government must implement a coherent and transparent policy on national transport while ensuring its effective implementation through an active National Transport Commission.? ?

UNP grassroots members want leadership change: Mayantha
	
Grassroots members of the United National Party (UNP) want a leadership change in the party but it couldn?t be done instantly, MP Mayantha Dissanayake said yesterday.
The UNP MP told journalists that grassroots level members have informed them that the recent restructure of the party had not met their expectations as they expected a leadership change.
?Most of the grassroots members say the recent restructure of the party had not met their expectations as they wanted a leadership change. However, it cannot be done instantly. I also feel that the party should be restructured effectively so that it could be successful at the Provincial Council Elections,? Mr Dissanayake said.
However, he said expectations of party men, who had undergone much suffering for 20 years, should be met sooner or later.
Asked whether there was any move by UNP backbenchers to function as independent members in Parliament if no effective changes were made in the party, Mr Dissanayake said his position was that effective changes in the party should take place. (Yohan Perera)

Water levels remain high due to rains: DMC
	
The water levels of the rivers, including the Kalu Ganga, had not receded due to the continuing showery weather, the Disaster Management Centre said today.
The DMC yesterday advised people downstream in Kalutara and the Ratnapura Districts to evacuate to safer locations, as the water level in Kalu Ganga was rising.
DMC Deputy Director Pradeep Kodippili told the Daily Mirror that prevailing rains in the South-Western parts of the country were expected to continue
?Four spill gates of Thabbowa Reservoir in Puttalam had been opened as a result of the continual rains,? he said.
?More than 124, 000 individuals had been affected,? he added.
Meanwhile, the Meteorology Department said showers or thunderstorms would continue to occur at times in the Western, Southern, Sabaragamuwa, Central and the North-Western Provinces.
?Showers or thunderstorms will occur elsewhere, particularly after 2.00 p.m. Heavy falls, about 100-150 mm can be expected at some places in Sabaragamuwa, Western, Central and Northwestern Provinces and in the Galle, Matara Districts,? the Department said.
It also said that windy and rainy conditions would be intensified in the Western and Southern sea areas from today.
?The sea area extending from Mannar to Pottuvil via Puttalam, Colombo, Galle and Hambantota can be rough or very rough at times as the wind speed can increase up to 60-70 km/h at times. Naval and fishing communities are also requested to be vigilant in this regards,? it said.
Meanwhile, the Police confirmed that the number of deaths reported due to prevailing adverse weather conditions had increased to 13, while one had gone missing. (KJ)

Why do Authorities Fear Right to Information Act
	
?
?
Come June this year it will mark the completion of two years after the Right to Information Act was passed in Parliament. The act came into force on 3rd of February?last year.? ?
Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) is also a highly discussed topic at present.
	The total amount paid to all officers and other staff of SLC in the form of salaries and other emoluments for the year 2016 was RS 392,359,219
	At present the Cabinet Secretariat is flooded with so many requests and it is heartening to know that Information Officer Jude Nilukshan promptly attends to requests.??
	By now several requests have been made from the National Police Commission which have?gone unheeded
An international seminar on this subject organized by the Sri Lanka Press Institute is being held these days in Colombo to coincide with the passing of this piece of legislation. Under the heading ?Gamata Nogiya Thorathuru Panatha? (The Information Act which did not reach the village) an article appeared in the ?Truthful Investigation? Column last year. Up to now more than 100 request letters have been received where their writers are seeking information. This week?s article deals with the institutions that provide information and those who do not wish to do so.? ?
An earlier article under ?Sathya Gaveshana? in our sister newspaper Lankadeepa dealt with a request made to the
?Commissioner General of Rehabilitation for a list of former LTTE cadres, who had been rehabilitated, and how the chief of that institute had questioned over the telephone the need for such information. It is accepted by many that all information relating to Security and institutions connected to security are strictly confidential. But a major part of that information can?t be considered as confidential. With the passing of the Right to Information Act most of this information can be released. However, as some officers still believe in archaic ideologies, they are reluctant to release such information. This is what happened at the Commissioner General of Rehabilitation?s office. Finally the seekers of information had to obtain relief from the Commission on Right to Information.? ?
With the passing of the Right to Information Act most of this information can be released. However, as some officers still believe in archaic ideologies, they are reluctant to release such information
?
The commission conducting inquiries into complaints consisted of Chairman Mahinda Gammanpila and its members: Justice Rohini Walgama, Attorneys Krishali Pinto Jayawardene, S.G. Punchihewa, Dr Selvi Thiruchandran and Director General Piyatissa Ranasinghe. The Chief of the Rehabilitation Commissioner General?s office was represented by its information officer.? ?
When the Commission inquired as to why the information was not revealed, the information officer replied that as the information was related to National Security he could not. He said that with regard to this request they had called for directions from the line ministry and the Ministry of Defense, for which they hadn?t received a reply. The Commission informed the information officer to clarify as to how statistics pertaining to the rehabilitated LTTE cadres, which the writers had requested, can interfere with the National Security. In reply he had stated that by revealing such information it could affect the personal lives of the rehabilitated LTTE cadres and therefore he couldn?t agree to the release of such information. He however failed to present facts in proof of the strategy he used.? ?
Accordingly, the Information Commission giving its ruling said that by asking for the reasons for requesting information, the Rehabilitation Commissioner General?s office had contravened with clause number 24 of the Act, and sub section 5 and clause under (wE). This clause stipulates that those who wish to seek information with the purpose of connecting with their loved ones in custody need not submit personal details.? ?
After two days of inquiry the commission directed the Commissioner General of Rehabilitation to provide all required information through the Commission on Information.? ?
The experiences of many writers reveal that the Ministry of Education comes under the spotlight as an institute which doesn?t provide information and that letters addressed to this Ministry don?t receive responses.?
Creating a fear psychosis?
There were several reports regarding the queries made requesting information. As confirmed by the Commissioner on Information the person requesting information is not obliged to disclose the reasons for his request for information. In this regard an awareness should be created among the rural people. This is because the questioning in a similar manner by the officers assigned with the task of providing information would create a fear psychosis among these individuals. This could discourage them from seeking information. By this type of action the responsible officers are preventing the public from seeking vital information.? ?
Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) is also a highly discussed topic at present. In addition to this sports body there are many national sports associations which have brought their financial operations under the spotlight. Many are of the opinion that no questions can be asked regarding these institutions. SLC believed that it does not come under the purview of the Right to Information Act. In order to check the veracity of this position writers sought information about the SLC requesting information like; the number of personnel at SLC, the names of executive officers, names of coaches listed under the SLC, the total amount paid as salaries to all the officers and other staffers of SLC for the year 2016 and the salaries paid to the listed coaches of the SLC for the Month of August 2017.? ?
When this request was forwarded to SLC, an officer functioning in the capacity of Legal and Information Officer had stated that the SLC does not come directly under this Right to Information Act. This officer had therefore requested that the information that was sought had to be obtained from the Ministry of Sports.? ?
While this remains so the Facebook page of this officer concerned introduces him as the information officer appointed under the Right to Information Act. Based on this information and mentioning that SLC too comes under the Right to Information Act and quoting the relevant legal provisions, an appeal was made to the officer concerned in the Ministry of Sports. Accordingly the officer appointed, Additional Secretary Siribaddana, instructed the SLC President in writing to provide the required information through the information officer serving the cricket controlling body in the island, as soon as possible.? ?
The information so obtained revealed that the total amount paid to all officers and other staff of SLC in the form of salaries and other emoluments for the year 2016 was RS 392,359,219. By the end of 2017 there had been 17 coaches serving SLC. Now the public can request for information not only from SLC, but also from any national sports body which had not been available hitherto.? ?
The above details refer to two institutions which didn?t respond favourabily when calls were made to obtain information.? ?
When the Commission inquired as to why the information was not revealed, the information officer replied that as the information was related to National Security he could not.
Cabinet Secretariat shows the way?
Going by the experiences of scribes, the Cabinet Secretariat has been rated as the best institution which responds to requests by the public without any hassle. This is an institute where the Right to Information Act is very favourabily implemented. At present the Cabinet Secretariat is flooded with so many requests and it is heartening to know that Information Officer Jude Nilukshan promptly attends to requests.? ?
?
Two letters appeared with regard to the Uma Oya project in the ?Truthful Investigations? coverage. At that time a politician in the opposition charged that in 2004 a Cabinet Paper had been submitted by Anura Kumara Dissanayake on the Uma Oya project. In order to obtain the veracity of this statement, a request was made for information regarding this matter from the Cabinet Secretariat. This newspaper was able to obtain the relevant Cabinet Paper.? ?
?
?
?
?
This Cabinet Paper presented, covering a period of 12 years, points out that issues that may emerge by harnessing the water resources in the dry zone of the South East, could be resolved only through the Uma Oya Multi Action Development Project.? ?
Dissanayake, as the then Minister of Agriculture, Livestock resources, Lands and Irrigation had submitted this Cabinet Paper in January 2005.? ?
Those who show interest in the decisions taken by the present Government or past Governments, and those who need Cabinet Papers for legal matters could obtain such information, under the ?Right to Information Act?.? ?
Accordingly the officer appointed, Additional Secretary Siribaddana, instructed the SLC President in writing to provide the required information through the information officer serving the cricket controlling body in the island, as soon as possible.
The experiences of many writers reveal that the Ministry of Education comes under the spotlight as an institute which doesn?t provide information and that letters addressed to this Ministry don?t receive responses. There have been instances where information seekers have received inadequate replies for the trouble taken to give repeated reminders to the ministry staffers.
By now several requests have been made from the National Police Commission which have gone unheeded. During one instance a complaint too had been lodged regarding the failure to give a reply. The Colombo Municipality and the Disaster Management center too have failed to respond to requests.? ?
Requests for information from the Ministry of Environment, Road Development authority, Ministry of Power, Electricity Board, Central Environment Authority, Forest Conservation Department, Uva Provincial Council, Commission on Procurements, Human Rights Commission, Public Services Commission, Department of Prisons, Ministry of Agriculture, Archaeological Department and Sri Lanka Police have provided favourable responses. The information gathered thus far is in the process of being included in articles that would follow soon. Much of the information gathered has been deemed as unobtainable by many others.? ?
Under the ?Right to Information Act? even the nongovernmental organizations are covered. Despite these organisations being included in the training sessions held earlier, whenever information is sought they fail to reveal the required information.? ?
Sri Lanka became the 113th country in the world to have adopted the ?Right to Information Act?. According to World Rankings the information Act occupies third place. However most of our citizens are unaware of this act and of the benefits they could reap from it.? ?
During an exercise in Kurunegala, carried out with the view of finding out the injustices caused to villagers due to the expressway, these villagers weren?t in possession of documents to prove the type of injustice caused to them. When asked why they have not requested for such documents under the ?Right to Information Act? they seemed to be completely unaware of such provisions. They had later obtained the necessary documents from a source. According to the Information Commission the least number of requests for information had been received from Western and Uva Provincial Councils.? ?
As a result of the predicaments experienced by the public, the Information Commission now stays in touch with the relevant ministries to include the Right to Information as a subject of study in schools and Universities. The necessary subject matter is in the process of being included and this process is led by Commissioner General of Information Piyatissa Ranasinghe and Attorney Jagath Liyanarachchi.? ?
Going by the experiences of scribes, the Cabinet Secretariat has been rated as the best institution which responds to requests by the public without any hassle.
However it?s apparent that many people aren?t showing any keenness regarding the implications of the Act and its uses. Given such a situation the Government and Non-governmental institutions should act with responsibility in creating awareness among the public on the importance and the usefulness of this Act.? ? ?

25 years of Bio Diversity; Let?s preserve our silver
	
Bio- Diversity may be a strange or uncommon word for those concerned mainly about their selfish interests but it is a crisis of life or death for Planet Earth. May 22 was the International Day for Biological Diversity and the United Nations in a statement says while there is a growing recognition that biological diversity is a global asset of tremendous value to present and future generations, the number of species is being significantly reduced by certain human activities.? ?
The Convention on Biological Diversity is the international legal instrument for ?the conservation of biological diversity, the sustainable use of its components and the fair and equitable sharing of the benefits arising out of the utilization of genetic resources? that has been ratified by 196 nations, the UN says in a statement to mark this important day.? ?
Given the importance of public education and awareness for the implementation of the Convention, the General Assembly proclaimed May 22 as the date of the adoption of its text, as the International Day for Biological Diversity by its resolution 55/201 of? December 20, 2000.??
The UN says 2018 marks the 25th anniversary of the entry into force of the Convention on Biological Diversity. Since entering into force, the Convention has been implemented through the vision and leadership displayed by countries, non-governmental and inter-governmental organizations, indigenous peoples and local communities, the scientific community and individuals.??
The theme for 2018 is celebrating 25 years of action for biodiversity. According to the UN, the results are considerable: the development of scientific guidance for the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity for biomes around the world, the entry into force of the Cartagena Protocol on Bio-safety, the Nagoya Protocol on Access to Genetic Resources and the Fair and Equitable Sharing of Benefits Arising from their Utilization and the creation and implementation of national biodiversity strategies and action plans.? ?
After adopting the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011-2020, parties have made significant headway in the achievement of a number of its Aichi Biodiversity Targets.??
The Strategic Plan is comprised of a shared vision, a mission, strategic goals and 20 ambitious yet achievable targets, the Aichi Targets. The Plan serves as a flexible framework for the establishment of national and regional targets and promotes the coherent and effective implementation of the three objectives of the Convention on Biological Diversity, the UN says.??
The mission of the new plan is to take effective and urgent action to halt the loss of biodiversity and ensure that by 2020 the ecosystems are resilient and continue to provide essential services, thereby securing the planet?s variety of life, and contributing to human well-being, and poverty eradication. To ensure this, pressures on biodiversity are reduced, ecosystems are restored, biological resources are sustainably used and benefits arising out of utilization of genetic resources are shared in a fair and equitable manner; adequate financial resources are provided, capacities are enhanced, biodiversity issues and values mainstreamed, appropriate policies are effectively implemented, and decision-making is based on sound science and the precautionary approach, according to the UN.??
The UN says the Convention?s 25th anniversary presents a rare opportunity to highlight the achievement of its objectives at national and global levels. It also provides an opportunity to look towards the future, particularly, as we start to consider the follow-up to the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011- 2020.??
UN Secretary-General Ant?nio Guterres in a message to mark this event says the welfare and prosperity of people now and in the future, depends on a rich variety of life on earth. Since December 1993, when the Convention on Biological Diversity entered into force, its parties have acted to conserve the earth?s flora and fauna, in a sustainable and fair way, the UN chief said.??
According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), Sri Lanka, along with the Western Ghats, is one of 34 ?biodiversity hotspots? of the world, with a large proportion of endemic species and a high dependence on its biodiversity for tourism and other social and economic activities.? ?
Sri Lanka ratified the UN Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) in 1994. Article 6 of the CBD requires contracting parties to develop a National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan (NBSAP), or an equivalent instrument. This strategy acts as the principle instrument for the implementation of biodiversity conservation at both the national and global level.? ?
We hope eco-friendly and responsible Sri Lankan citizens will go beyond the pettiness of party politics and preserve Sri Lanka?s biodiversity with this island paradise known to be having hundreds of varieties of unique species.? ??
