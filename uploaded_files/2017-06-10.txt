850,000 affected by drought in N/E- DMC
	
While some 600,000 people had been hit by the recent floods and landslides in the South, a total of 849,752 individuals belonging to 243,683 families in eight districts in the north and east had been affected by the severe drought condition across the country, the Disaster Management Centre census revealed yesterday.
The DMC situation report issued last evening showed the Northern Province as the most affected area with 452,907 people of 130,931 families affected by the drought.
According to the report the Eastern Province was the second most drought hit area with 200,451 individuals in 55,249 families being affected.
DMC Deputy Director (Early Warning) Mr. K.A.D.P.K.Kodippili told Daily Mirror that DMC is supplying drinking water to the affected areas and the affected people were compensated by the government.

Appreciate move by Health Minister to import Dextran 40: GMOA
	
The Government Medical Officers? Association (GMOA) yesterday said that it appreciated Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne?s immediate and positive response to their reports of a shortage of Dextron 40, a drug used to treat dengue patients.
GMOA Media Spokesman Dr. Samantha Ananda told a news conference that Minister Senaratne had immediately agreed to import more Dextron 40 after the revelation made by the GMOA about the shortage of the drug in the country.
?During the last Disaster Management Committee meeting, where all the experts were present, the ministry?s Medical Supplies Division (MSD) director acknowledged that there was a shortage of the drug Dextron 40 in their stores.?
He said it was reported that the stock of Dextron 40 was sufficient only for three days, adding the Health Ministry should reveal to the public just how much Dextron 40 was available after the expiry of these three days.
Meanwhile, he said that it would be better if Minister Senaratne could have responded to other issues brought up by them in a similar manner.?It is necessary to show the same amount of concern for issues relating to the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) as well. Minister Senaratne should also look into the problems that have cropped up with regard to the transfer of doctors in State hospitals and to control tobacco consumption in the country,? he said.

Boris Johnson refuses to back May for Prime minister
	
?
Boris is the favorite to be the next Tory leader - and has already repeatedly refused to back Theresa May after her election nightmare. ??
The outspoken Foreign Secretary was asked if he believes Mrs May should be Prime Minister but would only say ?it?s early days? after retaining his Uxbridge seat. ??
He also stayed silent when a reporter suggested that the Tory leader was ?fatally wounded? - and then appeared not to hear when another journalist asked him: ?Does your party need a new leader? Is it you??.The knives are already out for the Tory leader after a dismal campaign, a series of policy blunders and a manifesto now branded the party?s ?worst ever?. ?Theresa May is said to have ?no intention? of resigning and plans to form a Government - but some MPs including Anna Soubry said she should quit as soon as possible. ??
Jeremy Corbyn has again repeated his demand that Mrs May leaves office immediately - John McDonnell said he expected Boris? leadership campaign to start today. George Osborne said the result was ?completely catastrophic for the Conservatives and Theresa May? and said the woman who sacked him would be lucky to survive. ??
Nigel Evans, member for Ribble Valley, told BBC 5 Live that her decision to call a snap election meant: ?We didn?t shoot ourselves in the foot, we shot ourselves in the head?. ?

DMC didn't save lives; only distributed relief: JVP
	
The Disaster Management Centre (DMC) has confined itself to distributing relief whenever there is a disaster and had kept away from its main duty of preventing such situations, Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) MP Sunil Handunetti said yesterday.
He said DMC had failed to save people's lives from the recent floods and landslides.
"The number one priority should be to save lives while the saving of property comes next. However we failed to see these institutions doing this during the recent disaster" the MP said and added that Sri Lanka had no mechanism to check the smooth flow of water from the main rivers into the sea. He said water from 15 main rivers did not flow into the sea as it should.
The MP said none of the divisional secretariats which was affected had a boat to be used in rescue operations.
Joint opposition MP Dallas Alahaperuma said function of preparing and publishing weather forecasts should be outsourced because the Meteorology Department had failed to perform its duties effectively.
He said it was the societal machinery which went into action on the onset of the disaster while the state machinery went into action much later. "Politicians and media also went into action before the State" he said and added that the long-term programmes launched during the tenure of the former presidents, J R Jayewardene and Mahinda Rajapaksa should be continued.

IS is re-organising, targeting Europe: UN official

UNITED NATIONS AFP June8, 2017- Despite defeats in Iraq and Syria, the Islamic State group has reorganized and is now ?more focused than ever? on attacking Europe and other areas outside that conflict zone, a senior UN official said Thursday. ??
??ISIL, despite continuous military pressure, continues to resist, particularly in Mosul and Raqa,? said UN Under-Secretary-General for Political Affairs Jeffrey Feltman, using an acronym for IS. ??
??At the same time, ISIL has reorganized its military structure, giving more power to local commanders and is more focused than ever before on enabling and inspiring attacks outside of conflict zones.? Speaking before the UN Security Council, Feltman cited recent attacks in Belgium, Britain, France, Germany, Russia, Sweden and Turkey. ??
The group has posted fewer messages on social networks in the past 16 months, but ?the threat persists as supporters outside Syria and Iraq collect and redistribute this propaganda.? The total number of IS fighters and the group?s revenues have also dropped during the same period, Feltman added. ??

Elections Commission Chairman Mahinda Deshapriya said he hoped the government would act swiftly and in earnest to enact legislation to clear the bottlenecks which are delaying the local government elections.
He said the draft Bill had been gazetted ahead of presenting it in Parliament and the gazette notice, specifying the number of candidates to be elected to each body, would become effective from July 1, clearing one of the hurdles for conducting the polls.
Mr. Deshapriya said the deadlock was caused by the major shortcomings in the current law and the failure on the part of the subject minister to announce the number of members to be elected.

## Title: Looking for love in ?God?s Land?

Looking for love in ?God?s Land?
	
?I had no reputation to preserve, no status to maintain. I began to enjoy the familiarity of males, their easy banter and witty remarks though at times crude. It was a facet of social life that I had never tasted, open and devoid of double standards and remarkably fresh. Never had I experienced anything like that in the middle class society I grew in, almost frigid in the sphere of sex and eroticism.? ?
Glancing through a slim novel at a book sale, I decided to buy the book after reading the above passage. It?s not the kind of thing you come across every day in Sri Lankan creative writing. ?
?Widows world in the East? is a novel by Padma Edirisinghe published in 2002. The blurb says that she?s a former director of Teacher Education, and pioneer of the Children?s Creative Writing Project at state level, besides being author of 13 books and six translations. As far as this book goes, however, my initial enthusiasm didn?t last as I read through it. However, it gives a voice to a subject usually neglected by Sri Lankan writers ? sex, or erotic love, and how it affects minds and relationships. For that reason alone, it?s worth reading. ??
There is no sex in ?Widows World in The East.? Rather, the author gives an analysis of sexual mores and relationships as they exist today in the country, through her own first person narrative voice. Then there is the character of Xavier Wanigasekara, who says that there is a clear division of sexual mores on a geographical basis. As he puts it: ?Because you were born and bred within 25 miles of the coastline of Sri Lanka that got shrouded by Puritanism during the reign of Queen Victoria. England herself has spurned Victorian morals long ago but Lanka?s coastline faithfully holds on to it.? ?
?The highlanders of the interior are happily free of the notion that sex is a sin, he added.? ?
This was generally true several decades ago. The story is set at an earlier time. As it starts, a family is fleeing Colombo due to Japanese bombing and invasion threats. The narrator, a little, dark-skinned girl at the beginning, goes on to assume another identity and personality as an adult. A writer, she assumes the personae of Palingu Nona, a woman from a mountaneous village in the Ma Oya valley (the Land of the gods or ?deiyange rata?). She has a complicated history, having been raped by her father, but the narrator welcomes the phsychological change brought about by her transformation. ?
For one thing, Palingu Nona is physically more attractive than the narrator, who carries the onus of being dark-skinned like a beast of burden. As she puts it: ?Palingu was a robust healthy woman with big breasts and big buttocks. Sex appeal just screamed out of her. This naked sexuality of hers plus a pleasing face made her a very attractive woman.? ?
One plus point of this ?transmigration of souls? is that the narrator has access to Palingu?s lover. ?But the ingraining of the traditional Eastern culture within me was so strong that even after my voice was restored I would not have dreamt of asking her whether she had a lover after her husband died. But if I was keen to do a research on an average village widow?s life, now I had a golden chance. Palingu?s lover would come to me now. ?
?And he did come very direct and no-fumbling unlike city Romeos, who lost in the urban wilderness that includes hundreds of the other gender (with or without war paint), try to experiment with every new female they meet and end up sad novices.? ?
Both women are widows. A widow is under greater social constraints. But the narrator?s exploration of sexual hypocrisy and related pressures aren?t limited to the state of being widowed. As she writes with impish humour: ? ?My grandmother? writes a feminine Lankan author, ?is the mother of eleven offsprings, but she is so averse towards sex that I often wonder how she begot them. Maybe King Sakra placed his big toe on her navel or some proximate place.? ? ?
?And here is a male writer again from my own dear ?Taprobane...?, My parents never touch each other in public that when I hear from a classmate how close they get to each other at night I recoiled at the adult hypocrisy.? ?
?So it is not the sex act which hurt him, but the hypocrisy....sex is a taboo topic in female conversation, especially in the circles I move. Almost a stony silence is maintained on the subject except when the more garrulous, when provoked would declare. ?
?The sex act! Ugh! I just hate it. It is so brutal. Just like an animal assault.? ?
?Evidently the females who enjoy sex keep mum about it. Never do you hear expressions as ?I love sex? ?I just enjoy sex.? And no typical Lankan woman would go around asking another, ?How is your sex life?? ?What are you doing for sex?? ?Have you lovers?? ? ?
This author should be commended for her moral courage. It is nothing short of brave to write the above. This is no feminist tract since she is frank about female sexual hypocrisy. She has gone where Lankan writers of either sex rarely venture. As for the men, even if they dare (which is rarely the case) a male writer who writes the above will get pilloried for being sexist. ?
The book has major flaws. The plot line is ambitious, but its development is haphazard, and the author?s rather verbose prose style doesn?t help, either. Its strength lies in the narrator?s gradual exposure of her own sexual hypocrisy due to her higher social status and associated constraints and stigmas. ??
Dingi, Palingu?s lover to whom the lady in her transformed state has access, is a universal type who occurs often in literature ? ?Dingi was a likeable man. Very honest looking he just had no secret to hide. Handsome, muscular, hairy and smelling of cow dung that both repelled and fascinated me by the earthy odours.??
In other words, an attraction (fatal or otherwise) to the noble savage. This may sound like a clich?, but I recall an incident narrated by Maxim Gorky. An aristocratic lady from St. Petersburg goes for a vacation in the countryside and fancies a handsome young peasant. They choose an anchored boat by the river as their secret hideout. However, the lovemaking is cut short when the lady is attacked by mosquitoes. ?
Dingi is the deiyange rate re-incarnation of D. H. Lawrence?s gamekeeper Mellors, in the Lady Chatterley?s lover. But things don?t go that far here. The narrator mentions that the manuscript (which her intellectual friend Xavier dismisses sarcastically) is part of something longer. Despite all the book?s flaws, I wish she had put the rest of it into print along with this. The narrator presents a dissenting point of view raising its stubborn head from the depths of sexual suppression. She describes how sexual energy is channelled into chats and banter between men and women when she describes her friendship with Xavier: ??
?The only male I associated regularly was impractical Xavier, whose cynicism just awed me. I would not dream of attaching myself in a romantic way with him, that may or may not culminate in a physical bond. But he was a very good companion, garrulous and full of strange new theories. And I knew he liked me or maybe I flattered myself imagining he liked me. Perhaps he only wanted an audience to air off his views. ?
?But I knew he was selective, and the fact that he opted to spend a good part of his time with me, meant that he liked me. If in my loneliness now and then, a desire rose within me to reach out to him physically, that it was instantly driven underground, could only be explained by the earlier mentioned factors!? ?
Though the writer?s somewhat disjointed prose style often gets in the way, this is a very honestly written novella. ? ??

Rs. 8 bln needed for repairs after recent disaster
	
More than Rs.8 billion is needed to repair the damage caused by the recent floods and landslides, Disaster Management Minister Anura Priyadharashna Yapa informed Parliament yesterday.
In response to a question asked by JVP MP Sunil Handunhetti, he said this amount could be recovered from the Insurance Trust Fund (ITF).
?You said Rs.8 billion was needed to repair the damage caused by the floods and landslides and we want you to clarify whether the ITF will reimburse this amount. There are doubts about the reimbursement because the government has not paid the premium," Mr. Handunetti told the minister.
The minister confirmed that the ITF would reimburse the entire amount. ?We have already received an advance payment of Rs.150 million,? he said.
The minister admitted that the loss of life and property could have been mitigated to a large extent if the Doppler Radar System had not been damaged a few months before the catastrophe.
He said Japan had assured us it would provide two Doppler Radar Systems free of charge. (Yohan Perera and Ajith Siriwardana)

Sri Lankan Ranil Jayawardena wins UK election again
	
Ranil Jayawardena of Sri Lankan origin has emerged victorious in the June 8 British parliamentary elections for the second time, bagging 65.5% of the votes cast in the Hampshire North East constituency.
A ?traditional conservative? Jayawardena had no difficulty in beating his nearest rival, Barry Jones of Labor. Jones got only 17% of the votes.
Jayawardena came to the limelight in 2015 election (which he won), after a video showing a rival candidate threatening to kill him was released. The candidate, Robert Blay of the United Kingdom Independent Party was suspended from the party. Blay received only 4,732 votes.
This is what Jayawardena said about himself: ?As a pretty traditional sort of Conservative, I believe that families are the central blocks of building a society that works for everyone. That?s why I believe that it is the responsibility of all Governments ? of whatever hue ? to remove the obstacles that might discriminate against families.?
?Families come in all shapes and sizes. Over the last few decades, British society has experienced an unprecedented change in its attitudes towards family, including its attitudes to marriage and children. Prior to the 1960s, the percentage of children born outside marriage had remained remarkably stable for centuries and rarely went much above five per cent. Today, nearly half of all children born in Britain are born to unwed parents, of whom, sadly, 35 per cent have split up before their child?s fifth birthday ? compared with only 9 per cent of parents married before the birth.?
?Not only is the UK almost last amongst OECD countries ranked by the proportion of children and adolescents living in households with both parents, it is behind in recognition of family and marriage in the tax system also. While the human cost of this to children is impossible to quantify, the financial cost of family breakdown ? children of separated parents being up to 75 per cent more likely to face educational, behavioural, financial and health problems ? is estimated at ?47.5 billion a year.?
In the last parliament, Jayawardena had consistently voted against any investigation into the conduct of British troops in Iraq and has been a staunch advocate of Britain?s leaving the European Union.(newsin.asia)

Sri Lankan rebuild taking too long: Sanga
	
Sri Lanka may have upset the apple cart in the Champions Trophy with their victory against India, but rejuvenation of the Island nation's team has taken too long, says Kumar Sangakkara. And Sangakkara said the upheaval in the side had adversely impacted on the career of rising star Dinesh Chandimal.
On commentary during Sri Lanka's Champions Trophy Clash against India, which the underdogs won by seven wickets after completing a record run chase of 322, the 134-Test veteran expressed doubts about his country's ability to uncover and nurture the next generation of star players. Decorated pair Sangakkara and Mahela Jayawardena made their last appearances at international level in 2015, while Tillakaratne Dilshan retired last year. The trio scored more than 71,000 runs between them in all formats at the top level and Sri Lanka ? ranked sixth in ODIs, seventh in Tests and eighth in T20s ? have been in a rebuilding phase since. Sri Lanka have appointed Asanka Gurusinha, a member of their 1996 World Cup-winning team, as cricket manager for the next three years in a bid to address the issue.
Sangakkara said 27-year-old batsman Dinesh Chandimal, who has 12 international centuries, was one of few young players who had blossomed. Chandimal's talent is not in question, with the right-hander becoming the fourth Sri Lankan ? after Sanath Jayasuriya, Sangakkara and Dilshan ? to score five consecutive ODI half-centuries last year. He also has eight Test tons to his name. "The search has probably gone on a little too long," Sangakkara said when co-commentator Michael Atherton compared Sri Lanka's predicament to other nations who have faced similar challenges. "We've had two, two-and-a-half years of it now, looking for replacements for Dilshan, Mahela and we have some fantastic young players coming through. "One of the accusations directed at the management and the team has been that they haven't groomed anyone to fill those voids. "But I think the one man that was identified very early was Dinesh Chandimal, who performed excellently in South Africa, then in England, in Australia.
"He's actually had a period where he's been identified as the best young player (and was) appointed captain probably a bit too soon. "Then he was dropped from the captaincy, dropped from the team, so he's never had a consistent run in the position that he was identified for. "I don't think the environment he's played in has been very good for his confidence. Every time he now takes the field, it's almost as if (he's) playing for his place, for survival, and that's not a good place for a young player to be. "But also we have to re-look at a lot of the things that happen below international level ? our first-class structure, our 'A' team structure ? to make sure we actually drag those structures into the modern day." Sangakkara, who scored 12,400 runs as a wicketkeeper-batsman at Test level at an average of 57.40, said Sri Lanka had failed to recover from their losses as effectively as Australia and England.
Australia lost staples Michael Clarke, Brad Haddin, Shane Watson, Chris Rogers and Ryan Harris to retirement after the 2015 Ashes but have continued to unearth top-level talent, while England was left shell-shocked after being eliminated in the group stage at the World Cup two years ago and have transformed themselves as an ODI outfit since. However, Sri Lanka's famous victory over India may be a sign the wheel is about to turn.
"I think there are a few sides around the world that made tough decisions, tough changes," Sangakkara said. "Australia went through a period where all the big guns left and the youngsters had a year, year-and-half, two years of really adjusting and going through a tough time, but now they've regained their confidence, their abilities and their belief. "England, after the last World Cup, made some tough changes to their one-day set up.
"Andrew Strauss appointed director of cricket, new coaching staff ? that has paid dividends. "Sometimes when things are difficult?maybe it's wise to not repeat processes that you have been following for quite some time but actually have the courage to change, and not only change, but once a policy decision has been made, a strategy put in place, stick with it and go the distance with it. "It takes time, but when you do put in the time and effort, results do come." Gurusinha, who will review Sri Lanka's structure, agreed with Sangakkara's assessment. "The main reason why the rebuilding phase is taking long is because there was never an emphasis on grooming new talent once Kumar and Mahela were reaching the end of their careers. We simply didn't groom anyone to replace the duo," Gurusinha told PTI before Sri Lanka's Champions Trophy clash against India.
"Since I have worked 20 years in Australia (grade cricket coaching), I believe in that system and I am not going to change according to Sri Lankan system. With me, you see what you get. "I believe in speaking straight and that's been my trait since playing days. I have been direct with SLC president Thilanga Sumathipala and chairman of selectors Sanath Jayasuriya that I will do it my way. "I want to be straight with my players and vice versa. Of course, the players can question me and I want them to challenge my methods." Sri Lanka must beat Pakistan in Cardiff on Monday as they pursue a second Champions Trophy title after being declared joint winners with India in 2002.(cricket.com.au)

Unsolved murder in broad daylight of Batticaloa journalist Aiyathurai Nadesan

Jaffna District MP, Mathiaparanam Abraham Sumanthiran waxed eloquent during the course of the adjournment debate in Parliament on June 6th 2017. M. A. Sumanthiran who is also the official Spokesperson of the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) and its premier constituent, the Ilankai Thamil Arasuk Katchi (ITAK) emphasised that they stood ?for a country that is not divided, a country in which all the peoples will be proud of their equal status to live without discrimination or fear?.?
Speaking further Sumanthiran lamented the fact that there was much discrimination along ethnic lines in many spheres in the country. He pointed out that there was discrimination even in the matter of taking action to ensure justice for journalists victimised in the past.
The TNA Parliamentarian, who is also a lawyer touched upon the issue of attacks on journalists in this regard and stressed that there was discrimination in addressing such matters too.?
?Even in taking action, there is blatant discrimination. We commend you for taking action in the case of Prageeth Eknaligoda; in the case of Lasantha Wickramatunga, but there was a course of Tamil journalists who were killed. Why has the Government not moved one finger in respect of one of those assassinations? Why? Are Tamil journalists any less citizens of this country than Sinhala journalists? Is that your view? You do not have to answer that. It is blatantly obvious what your view is, when you do not do what you are supposed to do; when you do not do the right thing for certain sections of the community, but rush to do other things?.
The question of media freedom and the safety and security of journalists in Sri Lanka has been keenly debated in the past. The situation eased somewhat after the war against the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) ended in May 2009.?
Fresh winds of hope and optimism blew after the advent of the Sirisena-Wickremesinghe Government in 2015. A Government, which pledged ?Yahapalanaya -Nallaatchi-Good Governance? took office. Among the positive features of the new Govt. was the effort taken to probe at least some of the cases where journalists were affected.
Media rights organisations have recorded several instances of media employees (Both full time and part time) being killed, injured, assaulted, abducted and/or made to disappear during the years between 1999 to 2011. Among such recorded incidents are the deaths of 25 journalists.?
An ethnic breakdown of the 25 journalists killed are Eighteen Tamils, Six Sinhalese and One Muslim. The most prominent among the journalists killed was my friend and colleague, Lasantha Wickrematunga the founder-editor of ?The Sunday Leader. He was gruesomely killed on a public road in Ratmalana while on his way to work.
?
Sirisena-Wickremesinghe Govt.
The Sirisena- Wickremesinghe Govt. to its credit has initiated fresh probes into the assassination of Lasantha Wickrematunga.?
Action is also being taken to seriously investigate some other incidents like the enforced disappearance of freelance journalist and cartoonist Prageeth Eknaligoda, abduction and torture of The Nation?s Deputy Editor Keith Noyahr and assault on Rivira Editor Upali Tennekoon.?
Some forward movement of a positive nature has been recorded in these investigations so far. What the final outcome would be is something which still remains in the realm of the unknown.
While the actions being taken in these instances are indeed commendable, one is also struck by the fact that apart from the Lasantha assassination, very little or practically no action has been taken in the cases, where journalists have been killed. It may not be entirely a coincidence that most of the journalists killed are by ethnicity -Tamils.?
This gives rise to an impression that the absence of positive action in these matters is due to discrimination on ethnic grounds. This opinion that was articulated strongly by Sumanthiran in Parliament last Tuesday.
It is against this backdrop that this column intends to focus this week on the assassination of a journalist 13 years ago.?
Aiyathurai Nadesan, serving as Batticaloa correspondent of the Tamil daily Virakesari was shot dead in broad daylight in the heart of Batticaloa town on May 31st 2004.?
No concrete action has been taken to even investigate the murder so far. Nadesan was a friend whom I had known for about 26 years. I have written about Nadesan?s assassination, when he was killed. I shall however re-visit Nadesan?s killing with the intention of drawing attention to an unsolved murder of a journalist and friend.
The death of any member of the journalistic fraternity is distressing. More so when a scribe is gunned down in broad daylight by ?unknown? assassins for the ?crime? of writing something that displeases people with pretensions of power.?
The sadness is even more acute when the journalist was someone known to you for more than 25 years and had been immensely helpful as a source of accurate news and stimulating views.
Aiyathurai Nadesan was shot dead on May 31st 2004 at about 9.35 a.m. in Batticaloa. He was riding his motor cycle to work when the assailants shot him dead at point blank range on Boundary Road. Leaving his home on Lake Road, Batticaloa at 9. 20 a.m. Nadesan had followed his usual practice of picking up his Virakesari copy from the boutique next to the Virakesari office on Central Road.
?
Two Men on a blue motor cycle
Nadesan, though a journalist worked as an income tax assessor, too. He was going along Boundary Road and nearing his Bar Road office, when the assassins struck. Two men on a blue motor cycle ? both wearing helmets ? were the killers. At least four shots were fired at point blank range from a 9 mm. Two hit Nadesan?s shoulder and chest. One struck his hand. The killers whizzed away. There were many witnesses but none came forward to give evidence to the Police.
Nadesan?s bike knocked against a concrete lamp post and he was thrown off. Nadesan fell into a drain. The fall had resulted in his ribs getting fractured. He lay bleeding about 200 yards away from his workplace on Bar Road and died at the spot after a while.?
The Bar Road-Boundary Road area is a very busy place in the morning. Many people saw Nadesan lying in the drain for a long time. Yet no one came to his aid. Such was the state of fear in Batticaloa, that people were scared to display even the most basic human tendencies at times like these.
The people of Batticaloa were in the grip of two contending ?terrorist? forces at that time. The clash for supremacy between the mainstream Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) and the Batticaloa - Amparai dissident faction led by ex-tiger eastern commander Vinayagamoorthy Muralitharan alias ?Col? Karuna had led to a situation where lives were being snuffed out without restraint.?
People were afraid to talk freely as they did not know who supported Pirapaharan and who supported Karuna.
It was left to a fellow journalist, Thurairatnam and the TELO Batticaloa Organiser Prasanna to go to the spot, examine the body of the lifeless, Nadesan and alert the authorities. The then Batticaloa Magistrate M. Ajmeer went to the place at about 11 a.m. and ordered that the body be taken to the hospital and handed over to the family after an inquest. This then was the sad tale of Nadesan?s demise.
Though a resident of Batticaloa for nearly 20 years, Nadesan was not an easterner. His wife Gowri was from Batticaloa. Nadesan however had adopted Batticaloa as his native place and integrated himself with the region.?
He spotlighted the problems facing the people aptly. He was easily one of the best Tamil media journalists in the country at the time of his death.
?
?Nellai Nades? of Nelliaddy
The 49-year-old scribe hailed from Nelliaddy, Karaveddy in Jaffna. My mother?s village Kaddaively (Thunnalai South, Karaveddy) was adjacent to it. Nadesan?s father Aiyathurai was a Cooperative Inspector with an impeccable reputation for honesty and integrity.?
Nadesan?s house was down Chettitharai Lane between Nelliaddy Central College and the Vathiri Road junction. Conforming to the practice adopted by many artistes and writers of adding their village name as a prefix Nadesan too used the condensed version of Nelliaddy ?Nellai? before his name. It was as ?Nellai Nades? that he wrote articles, short stories and poems during his school and undergraduate days. When I first met him in 1977 while working at the Virakesari, he was known as Nellai Nades. Nadesan used to drop in frequently to meet the then Virakesari News Editor S. Nadarajah who was also from Anaipanthy in Nelliaddy.?
Later as a journalist, he used the by- line G. Nadesan.?
The ?G? denoted his wife Gowri. Technically Nadesan was not a full-time journalist. He was an Income Tax Assessor by profession.?
He was a part time journalist but in practical terms the part time was full time. He was the Batticaloa correspondent for the Virakesari and also for Shakthi TV and radio. He also worked for the London based International Broadcasting Corporation.?
Given the volume and scope of his journalism, one could safely say that Nadesan was far more productive than most full-time journalists in the Tamil media those days.
After obtaining a degree in Business Administration, Nadesan became a teacher for a while. Later he joined the Inland Revenue Department as a clerk and subsequently became an Assessor.?
He used to write articles as a free-lance contributor to the Virakesari under his pen name ?Nellai Nades.??
He later became the Virakesari?s Batticaloa Correspondent. Nadesan married in Batticaloa and settled down there. The ?Nellai? gave way to ?G? (Gowri). They had four children, two boys and two girls.
The news of a Virakesari Batticaloa correspondent being killed on the line of duty was and is of poignant impact to me. One of the happiest and challenging periods of life for me as a journalist on the Virakesari was when I worked as Batticaloa staff correspondent for three months in 1977. (June and Nov ? Dec).?
The Virakesari then had a brilliant journalist, V.S. Kathirgamathamby as Batticaloa correspondent. I had to replace him twice on a temporary basis then.
After Kathirgamathamby retired another close friend, Nithianandan became Batticaloa correspondent of the Virakesari. Nithy, an ardent Tamil nationalist got too involved with the LTTE. During the time of the IPKF, Nithy was viciously stabbed by some members of the pro-IPKF group, the EPRLF. Then Indian envoy J.N. Dixit arranged for immediate air lifting of Nithy to Colombo for urgent medical treatment at the request of Nithy?s journalist friends then.
After recovering Nithy worked in the Colombo Virakesari office. When the Indian army left he returned to Batticaloa and joined the LTTE as a full time member. He was later ambushed and killed by the Sri Lankan Army. Nadesan became the acting and later permanent Batticaloa Correspondent after Nithy.
?
?Thamil Makkal Viduthalaip Puligal?
Though the Police said that they had no idea who Nadesan?s killers were, the people of Batticaloa knew fully well, who they were. It was an open secret in Batticaloa that the killing was carried out by members of renegade leader ?Col? Karuna?s faction known as ?Batticaloa-Amparai Liberation Tigers.??
Subsequently they formed a new politico-military organisation called ?Thamil Makkal Viduthalaip Puligal? ?(Tami Peoples Liberation Tigers). When Nadesan was killed the Batticaloa grapevine hummed that the assassin, who was seated on the pillion and fired the shots was none other than ?Pillaiyan?.
Sivanesathurai Chandrakanthan alias Pillaiyan later made history as the first ever Chief Minister of the Eastern Province serving from 2008 to 2012. He is currently in detention as a suspect in the 2005 assassination of former TNA Parliamentarian Joseph Pararajasingham.?
After killing Nadesan the Karuna faction of the LTTE tried to justify it by accusing him of being a Prabhakaran loyalist. The mainstream LTTE on the other hand tried to derive propaganda mileage by claiming him as one of their own.
Though a Tamil nationalist in the ?70s and ?80s of the last century, Nadesan was more of a leftist than an ethno ? populist. When Tamil militancy grew, Nades was more aligned with the Eelam People?s Revolutionary Liberation Front (EPRLF) than the LTTE. Nades was closely associated with former EPRLF Northeastern Chief Minister Annamalai Varadarajaperumal.?
Nades and Varathan had been contemporaries at the Jaffna University and had also taught together at a Nelliaddy tuition centre later. When the northeast provincial council was formed Nadesan got himself seconded from government service and got appointed as Varatharajaperumal?s press officer. I think his official title was ?Information Officer.? Ironically Nades was also an unofficial censor when the North -Eastern Provincial Council was in existence.
Nadesan discharged his duties efficiently. With the LTTE threatening the Tamil media on the one hand, it was a formidable task to project the northeast provincial council activities in a favourable light. Nades did so, often exerting ?pressure? on editors and management personnel. One editor told me how Nades would often utter veiled threats in order to get pro-EPRLF news published.
?
Detained in a Bunker by LTTE
When the council was dissolved in 1990 and the bulk of EPRLF including Perumal fled from Sri Lanka, Nades did not follow suit. He opted to take his chances with the LTTE rather than fleeing the country to India. Nades was arrested as a ?traitor? by the LTTE and detained in a bunker prison. He was subjected to physical and mental torture. Nadesan?s stand was that he was only an employee of the Northeast Provincial Council, doing his duty. Finally, Nadesan?s brother Sivanathan, a prosperous mill owner had to pay a hefty donation to secure his release. The LTTE that detained Nadesan as a traitor may very well have killed him in captivity like many others if not for the money being paid. After Nadesan was killed the same LTTE started showering patriotic titles and organising condolence meetings and protest demonstrations in his memory.?
?
This was reminiscent of how the Tigers treated former Tamil United Liberation Front President Murugesu Sivasithamparam. In 1989 the LTTE tried to kill him as a ?traitor.? In 2002 when Sivasithamparam died of natural causes he was honoured by the Tigers.
As a journalist living in Canada and writing about Sri Lanka, I kept in touch with Nadesan on the phone for several years. He was a reliable source of information about events in the east. Though he espoused a strong Tamil nationalist line he was by no means a LTTE acolyte. Nevertheless he had to adopt a ?safe? course. Often he would tell me of happenings which he himself could never report in Sri Lanka.?
What he wrote in print and what he said on the phone were sometimes different. ?We can?t write the whole truth. At least you do something,? he would say.
This was a tremendous existential problem encountered by Tamil journalists in the northeast. Having worked as provincial correspondent for the Virakesari both in Jaffna and in Batticaloa, I know only too well the pressures on the outstation correspondent. Later on, the war situation imposed an immense burden on these poor souls. Even the brief interludes of fragile peace during the years of war did not bring any relief to the scribes in the northeast. In that context one is fully aware of the difficulties faced by Batticaloa based journalists like Nadesan, Uthayakumar and Thurairatnam in those days.
To strike a personal note, I have in the past faced several problems at the hands of the LTTE in Canada. I have been assaulted and had my limbs broken; the newspaper I ran had to close down because the Tigers intimidated shop owners and advertisers.?
Threats over the telephone were a regular feature. Scurrilous leaflets were often distributed. Anonymous letters in foul language threatening death would often be posted. Tiger media organs continued to portray me as a traitor and assassinate my character. Yet, I was still able to criticise the LTTE, whenever and where ever necessary because I was not living in northeast Sri Lanka then.
?
Staple Sustenance of Tamil Media
The scribes living in the North -east had to face this LTTE pressure in those days. There was also pressure from the armed forces and even other non-Tiger Tamil groups. However, the biggest threat was the LTTE and almost all Tamil newspapers in Sri Lanka toed a pro-Tiger line then.?
While Tamil nationalism is the staple sustenance of the Tamil media, the LTTE factor brought about a qualitatively destructive change then.?
Against this backdrop one would hesitate to judge journalists in Nadesan?s position without having walked in their shoes.
Unlike some ?bluff masters? who plugged a Tiger line and peddled fantastic bits of propaganda to any buyer, ranging from intelligence agencies to the BBC, Nadesan had striven to present a correct picture of developments as far as possible. I often listened to his reports in the London based pro-LTTE IBC Radio. I also read his Virakesari Sunday column regularly.
The significant thing about the column was that he did not distort facts. He left out some ?problematic? details, but never wrote utter falsehoods. His comments too never went to the extent of unbridled LTTE sycophancy like some others, since he himself was a Tamil nationalist and much of what he wrote was from that perspective. This however did not make him a ?Tiger? as both the LTTE and Karuna faction tried to portray him after his demise
The pro ? Karuna website ?Neruppu? which scooped the Nadesan killing described Nades as a ?Wannippulippathirigaiyaalar? ( journalist of the Wanni tigers). Tarnishing a dead man?s name to justify a dastardly killing is a typical Tiger trait. The Karuna faction was no doubt adhering to its roots in this matter. The brutal assassinations of perceived dissidents and critics by both the mainstream and rebel groups indicated that in the final analysis both tiger factions were ?paasisappuligal? (Fascist Tigers) and nothing else.
?
Capitalising on Nadesan?s Death
The Prabhakaran led LTTE began capitalising on Nadesan?s death. The Tigers organised a worldwide campaign condemning and mourning Nadesan?s death to obtain political mileage. A team of Tigers led by Senathi went to the funeral house and wrapped a Tiger flag around the body. Nadesan?s sister objected. The flag was removed. Later Nadesan?s body was taken to the Northern Province for cremation at the Aalankatti cemetery in Vathiri. The LTTE took over the funeral arrangements.
Homage ceremonies were organised in Vavuniya, Kilinochchi, Jaffna and Karaveddy. Nadesan?s body, now wrapped in a Tiger flag lay in state for people to pay their respects. The LTTE orchestrated large crowds of mourners. Leading LTTE figures spoke at the various ceremonies as well as the funeral itself. The LTTE organised a massive demonstration and hartal in the northeast to condemn the killing. Almost all the Tiger media started lamenting Nadesan?s loss ad nauseam.?
Tiger media organs devoted much time and space to Nadesan. In typical Tiger fashion, fund raising in his memory commenced overseas. Fund raising to the LTTE was like a fire hydrant to a mongrel.
The LTTE Leader Prabhakaran conferred upon Nadesan the posthumous title ?Naatuppattraalar? (Patriot). This is a second class honour bestowed upon people who have supported or assisted the LTTE. First class honour is the ?Maamanithan? (Great Human) title.?
?Taraki? Sivaram was made a ?Maamanithar?. By this action of dubbing Nadesan a patriot the LTTE tried to show the world that he was one of theirs.
Sadly all these efforts helped to strengthen the impression that Nadesan was a Tiger scribe. The truth however was different.?
This typical LTTE deception only helped to reinforce the Karuna Group charge that Nades was a Tiger associate. The LTTE damaged Nades after his death by trying to ?coopt? his image for their benefit. By doing so the LTTE distorted and diluted the widespread condemnation that should have arisen because an independent journalist was assassinated. Instead Nadesan was depicted as a Tiger in journalist garb. If the Karuna faction had taken Nadesan?s life, the LTTE had destroyed his reputation.
?
Necessary to Investigate Murder
Whatever his faults or deficiencies, there is no doubt that ?Nellai? Nades was a fine journalist and clever craftsman. Most of his articles were well researched and had a lot of facts and figures. I have at times relied on his articles to get data and statistics.?
Whatever his stance because of political compulsions, Nadesan?s death was a great loss to the Tamil community in general and the journalist fraternity in particular. Irrespective of the views he espoused, Nadesan?s killing has to be condemned forthrightly. It is also necessary to investigate this unsolved murder fully even thirteen years later and mete out justice to those responsible for killing Aiyathurai Nadesan.

Vaiko says SL behind his detention at KL airport
	
India?s MDMK General Secretary Vaiko said the Sri Lankan government is behind his detention at Kuala Lumpur International Airport on Friday.?
Vaiko, who has raised the Sri Lankan Tamils issue at the European Parliament in Brussels, felt that Sri Lankan government does not want issues relating to killing of innocent Tamils during its war against the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) to be raised in international forums.
Speaking to reporters on Saturday, Vaiko said he was shocked when immigration officials at Kuala Lumpur airport stopped him from entering Malaysia. He informed the officials that he was invited for the wedding reception of Penang Deputy Chief Minister P Ramasamy's daughter on Saturday. To back his claim, he produced the wedding invitation, a letter written by Ramasamy personally inviting Vaiko for his daughter's wedding, and other documents relating to his previous visits to Penang in 2014 and 2015.
The officials asked him whether he is a Tamil from Sri Lanka. He replied, 'No I'm a Tamilian from India.' He also said he was Member of Parliament and produced the ID.
He said that they asked him, 'Are you LTTE?'?
To which he said he replied, 'I am a supporter of LTTE'.
The officials told him since he has several cases against him they cannot allow him to enter Malaysia. Ramasamy's efforts to help him also failed, Vaiko said.
The officials cannot be faulted for they were helpless since they had orders from above, Vaiko said.?
But the common courtesy was lacking. Since he was treated like a detainee he decided to forego food. He and his secretary went without food for 24 hours, he said.
Vaiko said but for Brussels, he was denied visas to Germany, Switzerland, England, Canada and America. So far he hadn't brought this to the attention of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, but he will do so now. (Bangalore Mirror)
