M.I.A. slams Oprah Winfrey for calling her 'terrorist'
	
American singer, M.I.A. has slammed Oprah Winfrey for shutting her down and calling her a terrorist.
The English recording artist told Rolling Stone Magazine while celebrating 10 successful years of her album 'Arular', that in 2009 when she met the media proprietor first time in a party, she didn't pay attention on what the singer wanted to share and instead called her "crazy" and a "terrorist", E! Online reported.
The 39-year-old singer added that she wanted the 61-year-old talk show host to listen to her so that the word gets spilled that people were dying in her country Sri Lanka, but Winfrey made excuses that she had to interview Tom Cruise.
M.I.A. tried to explain that she was not a terrorist, she was a Tamil and asked her to look at the issue because she was Winfrey, who was expected to save the world.
