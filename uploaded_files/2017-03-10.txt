Are foreign women safe in Sri Lanka?
	
Sri Lanka is one of the best known tourist destinations in the world. Many tourists love Sri Lanka; in the past, Sri Lankans were considered very hospitable and friendly. The restrained, friendly nature of Sri Lankans is believed to be due to the influence of Buddhism.? ?
But what has happened to this majority-Buddhist country with a proud history? Cases of murder, rape, abuse, fraud, cheating and corruption are heard of everywhere, everyday. This was a country where a woman wearing her finest jewellery could walk in a city at night without fear.? ?
But things have changed for the worse. Now foreign women too have become targets of a few criminal-minded Sri Lankans, just like their local counterparts.? ?
?
	Many travel sites such as Lonely Planet warn foreigners who plan to come here about issues such as bus travel and dress codes outside Colombo
	
	
	Frequent complaints have been recorded against the harassment and abuse of foreign women and this number has been increasing over time
	
Nearest black mark
A Russian woman bathing in the Mount Lavinia sea was sexually harassed by two Ministerial Security Division (MSD) officers on January 28 of this year. With the support of the Mount Lavinia Coast Guard and the Police, the two suspects were captured as they tried to escape. The arrested suspects are a police constable and a driver aged 27 and 47 respectively, attached to the MSD and residents of Mirihana and Kanthale. After the arrest, one suspect was released. On Sunday 29, the case was heard in the Mount Lavinia Magistrate?s court. By now, both suspects have been released on bail and the next hearing is to be held on March 18.? ?
A reliable source told the Daily Mirror about what happened to the Russian tourist at the Mount Lavinia beach: ?
On the evening of January 28, people were seen gathered around a foreign woman and the police inquired about this. As told by the victim, she had been bathing in the water when a group of people surrounded her and one by one, began sexually harassing her. When she sat on the beach crying, people had gathered around her and the police had arrived.? ?
At the time, she remembered saying that Sri Lanka was a good country and requested protection from police to continue with her bath. The police agreed and she got into the water. The abusers came close to her again and she had shouted and pointed out the suspects to the nearby lifeguards and three wheeler drivers. With their help, the police had arrested two people while they were trying to escape. According to the source, one of the two people identified by her had nothing to do with the incident.? ?
The victim was in Sri Lanka for a two week tour and had been invited by a friend living in the country. Police Media Spokesperson Priyantha Jayakody said there had been no abduction and two off-duty police officers who were bathing near the foreigner had been arrested for sexual harassment and interfering with the police officers? duty.
?? Many travel sites such as Lonely Planet warn foreigners who plan to come here about issues such as bus travel and dress codes outside Colombo. Some foreigners had negative views but most visitors remained positive about holidaying in Sri Lanka.? ?
Expectations Vs Reality
Sri Lanka is expecting 4.5 million tourists in 2020, according to long-term development plans. Many new economic and development projects focus on tourism.. If we expect to earn from tourism, we should maintain a friendly image and an ideal environment. Never mind the facilities; can we at least protect tourists? ?
According to the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority (SLTDA) reports, only 219,360 tourists arrived in Sri Lanka in January 2017. 224,791 tourist arrivals were recorded in December 2016. ?
Frequent complaints have been recorded against the harassment and abuse of foreign women and this number has been increasing over time. Sri Lanka used to be famous for the wrong reasons, because of notorious incidents from the past such as the Rita Jones murder case. Many foreign women have issued warnings about coming to Sri Lanka.
???? Apart for the 2017 incident, a huge black mark was added to Sri Lankan tourism history in 2011, with the murder of a British Red Cross employee and the brutal assault and rape of his Russian girlfriend by a gang of eight men, including a provincial council MP, at a Tangalle tourist hotel. Though the government tried at first to hush it up, the suspects were imprisoned for 20 years following international pressure.? ?
Yet many harassment and abuse cases have gone unnoticed because ?the Sri Lankan legal system is too slow?. (Internet)?

Beijing demands US stop cyberattacks? after CIA hacking report
	
China on Thursday demanded the US ?stop its cyberattacks? after Wikileaks released a trove of documents which they said exposed the CIA?s hacking operations. ??
According to the documents leaked this week, the US spy agency has produced more than 1,000 malware systems -- viruses, trojans, and other software that can infiltrate and take control of target electronics. ??
??We are concerned about the relevant reports. China is opposed to any forms of cyberattacks,? China?s Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman said. ??
??We urge the US side to stop its wiretapping, video surveillance, espionage and cyberattacks on China and other countries,? Geng Shuang told reporters at a regular press conference. ??
??China will firmly safeguard its own cybersecurity. It is ready to enhance dialogue and cooperation with the international community to formulate a set of international rules on cyberspace acceptable to all parties,? he added. ??
By infecting and effectively taking over the software of smartphones, WikiLeaks said, the CIA can get around the encryption technologies of popular apps like WhatsApp, Signal, Telegram, Weibo, and Confide by collecting communications before they are encrypted. ??
The CIA on Wednesday denounced the leaks, saying they put agents in danger and aid the enemies of the Unites States. ??
China and America regularly carry out cyberattacks on the other, to the detriment of bilateral ties.?

## Title: Bridgo?s death should finally open the eyes of Indian authorities
## Section: News Features
## Date: 10 March 2017 02:15 am
Bridgo?s death should finally open the eyes of Indian authorities
	
It has finally happened. It?s been threatening to happen for a while now. The news is deeply saddening and everyone?s thoughts must be with the family members of the 22-year-old Tamil Nadu fish-worker from Thangachimadam in central Rameswaram, who was shot and killed while fishing illegally in Sri Lankan waters early yesterday morning.? ?
Bridgo?s death stands as a damning indictment of the Tamil Nadu trawler owners? stubborn refusals to stop sending their trawlers to fish illegally in Sri Lankan waters. His death underlines the catastrophic consequences of the Tamil Nadu government?s failure to take appropriate measure against boat owners whose trawlers are arrested for fishing illegally in northern Sri Lankan waters. Equally, if not more so, the death of a Tamil Nadu fishworker while fishing illegally in Sri Lankan waters will leave a dark stain on the reputation of India?s Ministry of Foreign Affairs and its Minister Sushma Swaraj. Despite repeatedly summoning her Sri Lankan counterparts and Sri Lankan fishermen to New Delhi, Sushma Swaraj has mishandled genuine attempts by the Sri Lankan authorities and Sri Lankan fishermen to bring to an end illegal fishing by Tamil Nadu trawlers in Sri Lankan waters.
?
?
And now a young man has died. Maybe this was what it was always going to take? One death that one hopes will make politicians in Tamil Nadu and those in New Delhi finally see sense. To understand that taking no action against Tamil Nadu boat owners - who pay their skippers and crew bonuses to fish illegally in Sri Lankan waters - risks the lives of Tamil Nadu fishworkers. To appreciate that constantly demanding the release and repatriation of arrested Tamil Nadu fishworkers and trawlers without penalties or fines, actively encourages illegal fishing in Sri Lankan waters. To recognize that the International Maritime Boundary Line that separates Sri Lanka from India in the Gulf of Mannar, the Palk Bay and the Bay of Bengal is sovereign. No different from any border that separates two adjacent countries and that Tamil Nadu trawlers have no right to cross without consent. ?
?
?
Sri Lankan fishermen have made it clear that they were utterly opposed to issuing licences to Tamil Nadu trawlers to fish legally in Sri Lankan waters. As recently as November in New Delhi, representatives of fishermen?s organizations from Jaffna, Kilinochchi, Mullaitivu and Mannar made statements individually and collectively urging Tamil Nadu trawlers to stop fishing illegally in their waters with immediate effect. When pressed by Tamil Nadu trawler owners to give them (the owners) more time ? a week, a month, a year - to withdraw from fishing illegally in Sri Lankan waters, Sri Lankan fishermen unanimously opposed the request. Sri Lankan fishermen responded, saying they would not give Tamil Nadu trawler owners so much as a minute more to fish illegally in Sri Lankan waters.? ?
?
?
In the days that followed the meeting of fishermen?s leaders, India?s Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Minister of Agriculture (and Fisheries) met with their Sri Lankan counterparts. They discussed how to resolve the problem of persistent illegal fishing by Tamil Nadu trawlers in Sri Lankan waters. Despite the best efforts of Mangala Samaraweera and Mahinda Amaraweera, the Sri Lankan delegation came away from the talks with only the promise of ?more talks?from Sushma Swaraj and her colleagues; but no commitment from the Indian side to end illegal fishing by Tamil Nadu trawlers in Sri Lankan waters.? ?
Talks between the two governments? officials duly took place in January. In the background, the Sri Lankan navy continued to arrest Tamil Nadu trawlers apprehended while fishing illegally in Sri Lankan waters. While officials talk, Tamil Nadu trawlers continue to fish illegally in Sri Lankan waters. According to press reports, there are currently 85 Tamil Nadu fishworkers and 128 Tamil Nadu trawlers in the custody of Sri Lankan authorities. Last week the Tamil Nadu government repeated its many calls for the unconditional release and repatriation of Tamil Nadu fishworkers and their trawlers. It is alleged that Indian diplomacy is behind the recent announcement by the Ministry of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources to the release of 42 Tamil Nadu vessels. The release of vessels will be timed to coincide with the visit of the Indian Prime Minister to Sri Lanka in May, in yet another ?gesture of goodwill?. ?
?
The emptiness of these ?good will gestures? was laid bare early yesterday morning. The ?goodwill? that the Sri Lankan government repeatedly shows towards the government of India must now be reciprocated in full and with interest. The government of India must accept that the unconditional release and repatriation of Tamil Nadu fishworkers and trawlers has no part to play in bringing to an end illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) by Tamil Nadu trawlers in Sri Lankan waters. The government of India too must accept that the responsibility to stop IUU fishing by Tamil Nadu trawlers in Sri Lankan waters lies not with the government of Sri Lanka in Colombo, but in New Delhi and Chennai.? ?
Nor can the Sri Lankan authorities be expected to step back from protecting Sri Lankan sovereignty in the Gulf of Mannar, the Palk Bay and the Bay of Bengal. It?s not just fishing boats that move illegally across the maritime boundary line that separates the two countries. Yesterday?s tragedy notwithstanding, no one should be left in any doubt about the immediacy of the consequences they may face, should they be apprehended while engaged in anything on the wrong side of the border. ?
?
?
One life can change a nation. So there must be hope that Bridgo?s death will finally open the eyes of the Indian authorities in New Delhi, if not in Chennai about the need to stop Tamil Nadu trawlers fishing illegally in Sri Lankan waters. Today is a sad day but it is now clearer than ever before. The responsibility to end IUU fishing by Tamil Nadu trawlers in Sri Lankan waters lies with the Indian authorities. They need to act now, with immediate effect and with whatever means at their disposal.?

Cancellation of lease: Hashim says not officially informed
	
Public Enterprises Minister Kabir Hashim told Parliament on Friday that he was not officially informed about the cancellation of the lease by SriLankan airlines.
He said this in response to a question asked by MP Mahindananda Aluthgamage who pointed out that the cancellation had been done without the knowledge of the minister.
"Mr. Aluthgamage's statement is not factually correct as I was not officially informed. I knew that negotiations were going on to cancel the deal," the minister said and added that the cancellation was correct as it was going to cause heavy losses to the government.
Mr Aluthgamage said the President had directed that a cabinet paper be submitted by the subject minister and not by anyone else.
"Today, Cabinet papers are prepared at Temple Trees," he said.
Mr. Hashim said such things only happened during the previous regime. "The ministers were virtually silenced at that time," he said adding that the President's directive was for subject ministers to be involved in submitting Cabinet proposals. (Yohan Perera)

Death toll in IS attack on Kabul military hospital rises to 49
	
?
The death toll from a brazen attack on Afghanistan?s largest military ?hospital by terrorists disguised as medics has risen to 49 with dozens ?wounded, a senior health official said on Thursday.
Salim ?Rassouli, director of Kabul hospitals, said 49 people had been killed in ?the attack on Sardar Daud Khan Hospital on Wednesday and at least 63 ?were injured.
Some uncertainty remained over the exact figures and ?one security official said more than 90 people had been wounded. ?Earlier estimates had put the number of dead at 38, with 70 injured.
The Islamic State claimed the attack through its Amaq news agency. ?The group also posted photos that it said were taken by its fighters ?within the hospital and an image of the five fighters who were ?purportedly involved in the attack.?
The terrorists rampaged ?through the 400-bed hospital, shooting doctors, patients and visitors ?and battling security forces for almost six hours in a sophisticated ?operation.
Mohammad Nabi, a doctor at the hospital who escaped with a broken ?leg, said it had been difficult to comprehend what was going on ?initially as the terrorists in doctors? white coats took out concealed ?weapons and began shooting.
?We were shocked when we saw AK-47s in ?their hands firing,? he said. ?They killed our patients in their beds ?and they killed our doctors.?

Fixed dates to release Scholarship, G.C.E. O/L and A/L exam results
	
The Education Ministry had issued fixed dates for the release of Grade Five Scholarship, G.C.E. Ordinary Level and G.C.E Advance Level examination results each year, Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam said yesterday.
He said this decision was taken so that the students could have a clear idea about their future education plans.
?Due to the late issuance of exam results, Advanced Level students are not in a position to apply for foreign university programmes,? the minister said. Thus, he had instructed the Examination Commissioner General to issue the results on fixed dates.
Accordingly, the release dates of examination results are as follows; G.C.E. A/L on December 27, G.C.E. O/L on March 28 and Grade Five Scholarship exam on October 5.
Minister Kariyawasam said his attention was drawn to hold the G.C.E. O/L and A/L examinations at the year end in 2019, in a bid to save the students? time.

GTF urges UNHRC to adopt new resolution on SL
	
While welcoming the UN Human Rights High Commissioner?s latest report on Sri Lanka, the Global Tamil Forum (GTF) urged the UN Human Rights Council to adopt a new resolution on the country.
Issuing a statement on Thursday, the GTF commended High Commissioner Zeid al-Hussein and his office for their forthright and thorough assessment, and concur with their observation that ?stronger, tangible results needed to be forthcoming without further delay to prevent any further dissipation of hard-earned trust.?
?While acknowledging the Sri Lankan Government?s constructive engagement with the United Nations? human rights mechanisms, the report was emphatic that the ?fulfilment of transitional justice commitments has been worryingly slow and the structures set up and measures taken were inadequate to ensure real progress,? it said.
It said the report was categorical that the Government has not moved fast enough with tangible measures that would immensely help build confidence among victims and the Tamil community.
The GTF said the report analysed a number of emblematic cases involving security forces with no decisive progress to-date and reiterated the High Commissioner?s view that ?international participation in accountability mechanisms remains a necessary guarantee for the independence, credibility and impartiality of the process and an integral part of the commitments of the Government under the Human Rights Council resolution.
?It is in this light that we are dismayed and reject the statements from the Sri Lankan leaders, including a recent statement from Prime Minister Wickremesinghe that argues participation of international judges would require constitutional amendments with approval from country wide referendum. The High Commissioner?s assertion that unclear and contradictory messages on transitional justice mechanisms by the President, the Prime Minister, and various members of the cabinet need to be acted upon with utmost seriousness,? it said.

The joint opposition said today it would continue its struggle inside and outside Parliament to secure the status of the main opposition in Parliament.
JO MP Dallas Alahapperuma said the exercise they were engaged in Parliament yesterday was the beginning of this struggle. ?Our request ot the Speaker was the first step of this struggle," he said and added that the former speaker had acceded to their invitation to assist their cause.
MP Vasudeva Nanayakkara said the recognition given to the JVP and the TNA was not correct as the JO had more seats.
?Recognising the JVP and the TNA is not correct because the people will get the wrong impression that they are the main political forces in the Sinhala and Tamil areas respectively,? he said.
MP Jayantha Samaraweera said the JVP and the TNA cannot be recognized because these parties agreed to everything the government did.
The JO said Minister Kiriella's behaviour was even worse than that of MP Dinesh Gunawardene, because it was the minister who applied the most amount of pressure on the Speaker.? (Yohan Perera)

Katchatheevu retrieval won?t resolve fishermen issue: Indian State Minister
	
Lashing out at the political parties demanding the retrieval of Katchatheevu from Sri Lanka, Indian Union Minister of State for Road Transport, Highways and Shipping Pon Radhakrishnan had asserted that retrieving the islet will not solve the Indian fishermen issue.
According to Deccan Chronicle, the Minister charged that the parties who put forth such a demand were imagining things and that it showed they lacked understanding on the subject.
?There are several issues revolving around Katchatheevu, ceded to Lanka in 1974 by India, The BJP government was never involved in it. In fact, the Jan Sangh had then opposed ceding of India's territory to Lanka,? Mr Radhakrishnan said.
Speaking to reporters he said on Thursday in Chennai, ?It is the sheer imagination of certain political parties that retrieving Katchatheevu will resolve the fishermen's problems. They lack knowledge on the subject.?
The issue, he argued, was not confined to the islet alone. One has to look beyond for a meaningful solution to the frequent killing of the Indian fishermen.
?If you think the retrieval will solve the problem. Then you are wrong,? he said and added this particular issue could be discussed when the need and such a situation arose.
Recalling External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj's role in ensuring negotiations between Indian and Sri Lankan fishermen and the representatives of the Sri Lankan government and Tamil Nadu, Mr. Radhakrishnan said despite her health condition, Ms Sushma undertook the visit to Colombo in good faith of resolving the crisis. She had to undergo kidney transplant later on. ?Nowhere will you find such a minister who is dedicated to the people's cause,? he added.

ISLAMABAD AFP March9, 2017- A Pakistani court has ordered the government to open an investigation into online ?blasphemy?, threatening to ban social media networks if they failed to censor content deemed insulting to Islam, lawyers said Thursday. ?
The issue came to the fore in January when five secular activists known for their outspoken views against religious extremism and the powerful military were disappeared, presumed abducted by state agencies according to opposition parties and international rights groups. ?
Four of them were later returned to their families weeks later, but not before they were tarnished by a virulent campaign to paint them enemies of Islam deserving execution. ?

Irrigation engineer in charge of the reservoir, R.J.Jayasinghe said the capacity of the reservoir had reached 112,500 acre feet by last morning.
He said the maximum capacity of the reservoir was 110,000 acre feet and that the spill gates would be opened when the water level reached 160,000 in the Maha season.
He said the spill gates would not be opened in the Yala season when continual rains were not experienced. However he said the spill gates will be opened if heavy rain continued.
Jayasinghe pointed out that usually the water level in the reservoir would have dwindled to a great extent by March and April and that it was surprising the reservoir had reached spill level in March itself. (K.G.karunarathe)

The terms of three provincial councils- North Central, Sabaragamuwa and Eastern Provincial Councils- will end this year. The terms of other councils are due to end next year. However, the government is now contemplating whether the elections to the North Central, Sabaragamuwa and Eastern provincial Councils could be withheld this year so that all could be held later next year on a single day.
According to sources close to the government, the move is aimed as a cost cutting exercise.
The staggered elections were conducted during the previous rule and barring the Northern Provincial Council Elections, all others were won by the United People?s Freedom Alliance (UPFA). ( Kelum Bandara)

Prison riot: Move to compensate victim families condemned
	
The Committee for protecting rights of prisoners vehemently condemned the Government's alleged attempt to hold back the 2012 November 9 brutal killing of prisoners during the prison riot, by compensating the victims and their families
The President of the organisation Attorney Senaka Perera in a statement said that the STF and some members of the armed forces invaded the prison premises on the instruction of a former VIP and killed 27 selected unarmed prisoners.
The statement says that the intruders by placing weapons near the dead bodies had attempted to cover it up saying they were killed since the prisoners carried weapons,
The statement further said that even though the present Yahapalana government assured the public to punish the killers of the prison riot it has not been done so far.
However as a result of continual protests of the committee the government appointed a three member Commission to inquire the incident
During the inquiry eye witnesses had given evidence before the commission and the commission had tendered their observations and recommendation to the government one year ago.
In the meantime the government during a cabinet meeting had decided to compensate only 16 victims of the incident.
The Committee vehemently condemned the government?s efforts to hold back the incident which had become a national and international concern by merely compensating the victims without punish the perpetrates, the statement said.
The statement also underscored the fact that if the government really wanted to do fair dealings to the victims' relatives, to arrest the killers and bring them to book.
The committee says that while 27 prisoners were killed and the government?s suggestion compensating only 16 of them was a joke.
The statement asked whether the other 11 prisoners committed suicide inside the prisons.
The Committee requests the government to take steps according to the law and punish the killers without attempting to persuade the Geneva Human Rights Commission and other groupings. (T. Farook Thajudeen)

SAITM issue: GMOA threatens major TU action if deadline elapse
	
The Government Medical Officers? Association (GMOA) yesterday threatened to resort to major trade union action next week if the committee appointed by President Maithripala Sirisena to probe the SAITM issue does not give its final decision within one week.
GMOA Media Spokesman Dr. Samantha Ananda told a media briefing that the GMOA took this decision following an unanimous approval of its Central Committee.
He said they also decided to make a written complaint to the President against what they called the political-insanity of Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne, Higher Education Minister Lakshman Kiriella and former higher education minister S. B. Dissanayake on this issue.
He said the GMOA would further strengthen the awareness and protest campaigns in the coming days and added that they were expecting a justifiable decision on the questioned-standards of the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) in Malabe from the committee appointed by the President.
He said the Health Ministry and the Higher Education Ministry still hold the responsibility of the medical education?s standards and stressed that the SAITM was not an institute that has been accepted by the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC).
Meanwhile, GMOA Assistant Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said the GMOA has discussed the issue on Wednesday with the committee appointed by the President.
?The committee has arrived to a decision to take alternative solutions to the issue. We hope that those alternative decisions will be in favor to protect the standards of the medical education in Sri Lanka,? he said. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)

Samsung heir goes on trial for bribery charges
	
?
SEOUL AFP March9, 2017- The heir to the Samsung business empire denied all charges in connection with a wide-ranging corruption scandal, his lawyers told the first court hearing on his case Thursday. ??
Lee Jae-Yong, 48, was not present at Seoul Central District court for the hearing, and is being held in custody as his giant company -- the world?s biggest smartphone maker -- struggles to recover from a recall scandal. ??
Lee, the vice-chairman of Samsung Electronics, faces accusations of bribery, corruption, perjury and other offences stemming from a scandal that has seen President Park Geun-Hye impeached. Four other Samsung executives have also been charged. ??
??Everyone denies all the charges,? a defence lawyer told the court at a preliminary hearing which lasted little more than an hour. ??
The prosecutors? formal indictment was sketchy, with some of the accusations lacking clear evidence and only circumstantial, the defence said. ??
The accused paid nearly $40 million to Park?s close friend Choi Soon-Sil, allegedly as bribes to secure policy favours. ??
Samsung has insisted that the payments were charitable contributions it was obliged to make under pressure from officials, and not bribes. ??

SL assures full probe on fisherman's killing: India
	
The Sri Lankan Government has assured us that a full investigation would be carried out into the incident where an Indian fisherman was allegedly killed by the Sri Lankan Navy, Indian Minister of State for External Affairs, M. J. Akbar said.
According to PTI, several members of the AIADMK and DMK had today raised this matter in Parliament and asked the government to send a strong message to Sri Lanka.
The matter was raised by Kanimozhi of DMK and S R Balasubramaniam of AIADMK. The Government said the matter was taken up with the Sri Lankan government.
"The government considers this matter and the welfare and concerns of all fishermen most seriously. We have raised this issue through Vice President on the sidelines of a summit in Indonesia. The Sri Lankan Government has promised a full investigation," the state minister said.
Indian Vice President Hamid Ansari had raised this issue when he met President Maithripala Srisena on the sidelines of the Summit of Indian Ocean Rim Association (IORA) on March 7.
A 22-year-old Indian fisherman was reported to have been shot dead on Monday while he was fishing in a mechanised boat a short distance off the Kachativu islet. Local fishermen alleged that he was killed by the Sri Lankan Navy. Another fisherman was injured.
Kanimozhi said many fishermen have lost their lives and their livelihood have been affected. ?They (fishermen) are worried and they are not sure about coming back alive when they go fishing,? she said.
Describing this as a burning issue in Tamil Nadu, she said the central government is not responding.
Kanimozhi asked the Centre to take steps for the welfare of fishermen since it claims to be a "strong" government.
Balasubramaniam said the killing of fishermen was "not justifiable" under any circumstances and this incident should be strongly condemned.
He also said a strong message should be given to the Sri Lankan government.
"This issue of fishermen has a long history. This is the most unfortunate incident...Our views have been conveyed. A full statement on this will be made as soon as possible," the state minister said.
AIADMK member J Jayavardhan osaid Sri Lankan High Commissioner should be summoned by the Ministry of External Affairs to lodge a protest.

SL refugees who sheltered Snowden seek refuge in Canada
	
Refugee claims have been filed in Canada on behalf of the Sri Lankan and Philippine asylum seekers who sheltered former US intelligence contractor Edward Snowden in Hong Kong in 2013, lawyers involved in the matter had revealed on Thursday.
According to Time, the group of three lawyers who filed the claims on January 26, and have worked with Hong Kong-based Canadian barrister Robert Tibbo on the case, are now calling on Canadian immigration minister Ahmed Hussen to use his discretionary powers to expedite the applications.
?Over the course of the past few weeks, we felt compelled to take an additional step forward, so we formally petitioned the Canadian government to take these clients as refugees,? Montreal-based immigration lawyer Marc-Andr? S?guin said.
Fellow Canadian lawyer Francis Tourigny, who lived in Hong Kong from 2009 to 2013, noted the claimants? poor living conditions in the city and a heightened security threat since their assistance to Snowden was revealed. He said their plight was ?a matter of life and death?.
Claims emerged recently that Sri Lankan police had been in the Hong Kong looking for some of the refugees however, the authority denied doing so.
?It?s very clear that discretionary power should be applied,? S?guin said, referring to the Canadian immigration minister?s authority to speed up the processing of claims.
?These are people who fled persecution, who today in Hong Kong have no future as a result of the very nature of the system applicable to asylum seekers, and who are being actively sought after by authorities from their home countries,? he added.
Hong Kong?s asylum seeker acceptance rate stands at 0.6 per cent. In the few cases that have been substantiated, applicants were referred to the UN High Commissioner for Refugees for resettlement in a third country.
?It?s up to Canada now to do the right thing,? S?guin said.
The lawyer said they were confident that they had ?very strong cases? as they met every criteria to be accepted as refugees into Canada.
The asylum seekers who housed Snowden include Van?essa Mae Rodel from the Philippines, who has a daughter aged 4, Ajith Pushpakumara, a former soldier from Sri Lanka, and a family of four from the same country ? Supun Thilina Kellapatha, his wife Nadeeka Dilrukshi Nonis and their two children. All three children are stateless.
They have waited a number of years to have their protection claims screened by the Hong Kong government and said previously that they want to leave the city, naming Canada as their preferred destination.
Pushpakumara, 44, who arrived in Hong Kong in 2006, earlier said: ?I would choose Canada ... I heard I could have good protection [there] and hopefully I could work.?
The group of three Canadian lawyers ? S?guin, Tourigny and Michael Simkin ? travelled to Hong Kong and met the refugees in person for the first time on Wednesday after previously communicating through video calls.
In November, the three set up an NGO in Quebec named For the Refugees. The organisation has so far collected CAD$100,000 (HK$577,916) in donations and has held events raising awareness for the asylum seekers.

South Korean court to rule on president?s impeachment
	
?
By Anna Fifield ?
Washington Post, SEOUL, 09.03.2017 ? South Korea?s Constitutional Court will deliver its decision Friday in the sensational impeachment case against President Park Geun-hye, who?s at the center of a bribery scandal that has shocked a country all too familiar with corruption. ?
If the court removes Park from office, she will make history again. Not only will she have been South Korea?s first female president, she will also become South Korea?s first president to be impeached. ?But if the court reinstates her, it will generate a mass outpouring of anger from a public fed up with the corruption between the political and business elite, a system that is seen as holding ordinary people down. ?The court has been hearing evidence for 10 weeks on the case, considering whether to uphold the motion passed by the National Assembly in December ? with an overwhelming majority ? to impeach her. ?Since then, more explosive allegations have emerged, with special prosecutors this week saying they recommend a total of 13 charges against the president, including abuse of power and receiving bribes.

Three Ministers oppose SAITM
	
The authorities running the South Asian Institute of Technology and Management (SAITM) in Malabe behave more or less like underworld figures rather than administrators of an institution, Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka told Parliament yesterday.
Speaking during an adjournment debate on the issue, the minister said the controversy surrounding the recent shooting incident at the institution proved that they associated with the underworld.
He said education cannot be marketed as a commodity and therefore no private institution can run medical or engineering colleges. ?Only organisations that do not have profit motives in mind should be allowed to run an education institute but they should all be controlled by a regulatory body,? he said. The minister however clarified the fact that he was only voicing his own opinion and not that of the government.
However the minister criticised the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) as well stating that it was engaged in a process of limiting the number of persons who get into medical colleges and thereby pass out as doctors.
Minister of Social Service and former Higher Education Minister S B Dissanayake, under whose tenure the SAITM was established, stressed that the institution had been established legally. He said the Health Ministry had given the college its blessings on two occasions.
He was countering the calls made by Chief Opposition Whip Anura Kumara Dissanayake, who called for the immediate closure of SAITM. Mr Dissanayake said SAITM is clearly functioning illegally as it has not got the approval of either the Board of Investment (BOI) or the Ministry of Health to function.
Minister of Sports Dayasiri Jayasekera reminded those present that he had spoken out against the SAITM when he was in the opposition and said that he holds the same stance today as he had then. He said this mistake was done by the last regime.
Minister Susil Premajayantha also expressed the same sentiments. Joint Opposition MP Ramesh Pathirana maintained that the institution was set up illegally. He said the responsibility for clearing up the mess lies with the present government.
Meanwhile Minister of Higher Education Lakshman Kiriella charged that the SAITM issue had been politicised by the opposition to achieve their own selfish purposes. (Yohan Perera)
