AG directs CID to arrest Hirunika
	
Attorney General Yuwanjan Wanasundara Wijethilake yesterday ordered the arrest of Colombo District United National Front MP Hirunika Premachandra over an abduction of a person last month. 
AG Wijethilake who retired yesterday sent out the arrest order as one of his last official orders. Having studied CID reports relating to the abduction of 34-year-old Amila Priyanga Amarasinghe at Dematoagdoa on December 21, the outgoing AG ordered Director Criminal Investigation Department (CID) to make the arrest of female parliamentarian.
MP Premachandra is to be arrested over the abduction and conspiracy to do so in a defender vehicle belonging to her together with eight of her bodyguards. Earlier on two occasions she was questioned over her involvement in the incident.
The AG has earlier asked the media institutions including television channels to hand over to him the visuals relating to the incident including those of a media briefing held by the MP following the alleged abduction.
During the magisterial inquiry the court has also ordered telephone service providing companies to provide details of telephone conversation pertaining to MP Premachandra and other suspects during the abduction.
In his statements the victim had said that the MP was personally involved in the assault but she had dismissed the allegation and said that she only talked to the victim over an alleged illicit relationship he was having with the wife of a member of her staff.
On Wednesday, January 6, eight suspects who were taken into custody over the alleged abduction and assault of a person over a domestic dispute, were released on bail. The suspects were bailed after they were identified at an identification parade before Colombo Magistrate Court.(Susitha R. Fernando)

## Title: Escaped Mexican drug lord 'El Chapo' recaptured

Escaped Mexican drug lord 'El Chapo' recaptured
	
		 		 
		 
			
Infamous Mexican drug kingpin Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman, who humiliated authorities when he tunneled out of a maximum-security prison in July, has been captured, Mexico's president said Friday.
El Chapo was captured again after a fierce gun battle near the coast in his home state of Sinaloa, Mexican officials said. Mission accomplished: We have him, President Enrique Pea Nieto announced.
The arrest ended one of the most extensive manhunts undertaken by the government, involving every law enforcement agency in the country and help from the United States.
But it was the Marines, Mexicos most-trusted military forces, who managed to capture the fugitive in an early morning raid that left five of Mr. Guzmns gunmen dead, the Mexican authorities said. An American official also described the raid as a Mexican op, planned and executed by Mexico.
It is unclear whether the government knew Mr. Guzmn was in Los Mochis, or whether his capture was a fortunate coincidence. Officials said that Mr. Guzmn managed to escape from the home in a stolen vehicle before he was apprehended in a hotel on the outskirts of town.
The capture of the drug lord concludes a deeply embarrassing chapter for the government of Mr. Pea Nieto, which has been waylaid by a series of security and corruption scandals that reached their low point with Mr. Guzmns daring escape.
Now, a looming question is whether the Mexican authorities will try to hold Mr. Guzmn for a third time  he has already escaped from prison twice  or whether they will hand him over to the Americans. Mr. Guzmn, the head of Mexicos most powerful cartel, is facing indictments in at least seven American federal courts on charges that include narcotics trafficking and murder.
With operations that span much of Mexico, his organization has specialized in smuggling tons of drugs into the United States through vast networks of tunnels deep beneath the border. His success has made him among the richest drug dealers in history: Forbes magazine estimated his net worth at close to $1 billion.
Mr. Guzmn stunned the world last summer when he stepped into the shower in his cell, in the most secure wing of the prison, and abruptly vanished in full view of a video camera. Guards later discovered a small hole in the shower floor.

Mexico Prison Break by El Chapo Is a Blow to President Pea NietoJULY 13, 2015
It led to a mile-long tunnel to a construction site. The tunnel was tall enough for Mr. Guzmn to walk through standing upright  his nickname translates to Shorty  and had been dug more than 30 feet underground. It was equipped with lighting, ventilation and a motorcycle on rails. Some engineers estimated that the tunnel took more than a year and at least $1 million to build.
The prison break humiliated the government of Mr. Pea Nieto, which had proclaimed the arrest of Mr. Guzmn and leaders of other drug cartels as crucial achievements in restoring order and sovereignty to a country long beleaguered by the horrific violence associated with organized crime. It was particularly embarrassing because Mr. Guzmn had already escaped from prison in 2001, when his conspirators managed to smuggle him out. By some accounts, he escaped that time by hiding in a laundry bin.
There are still major questions ahead, including the potential extradition of Mr. Guzmn to the United States. Shortly after Mr. Guzmn was captured in 2014, the attorney general of Mexico at the time refused to extradite him to the United States, saying that the criminal would serve his time in Mexico first before he was sent to another country.
Officials and analysts said it was an effort to show sovereignty and put some distance between the Mexican authorities and their American counterparts, who often used a heavy hand to influence policy in Mexico.
But that stance came to haunt the Pea Nieto administration after the kingpin escaped. The United States had issued a formal request for his extradition less than three weeks before Mr. Guzmn broke out.
A few months later, the Mexican government extradited several top drug lords to the United States, suggesting a new spirit of cooperation in the wake of Mr. Guzmns escape. The people extradited included an American citizen, Edgar Valdez Villarreal, a notorious figure known as La Barbie, as well as people charged with participating in the murders of a United States Consulate worker and an American immigration and customs agent.
While the likelihood of Mr. Guzmn escaping from an American maximum security prison is considered low, extradition would still come at a cost to the image of the Mexican state, some analysts say. Extraditing him is a way to say we cannot cope with this with our own institutions, said Pablo A. Piccato, a history professor at Columbia University. While this is something everyone knows, obviously the government has not been able to publicly recognize this or tackle it in the past.
Several high-ranking politicians from Mr. Pea Nietos party were already calling for extradition, including Emilio Gamboa, the head of the governing party in the Senate, who told local news media that he agreed with the idea.
In a statement on Friday, the American attorney general, Loretta E. Lynch, commended the Mexican authorities who have worked tirelessly in recent months to bring Guzmn to justice. But she did not directly answer the extradition question.
The U.S. Department of Justice is proud to maintain a close and effective relationship with our Mexican counterparts, and we look forward to continuing our work together to ensure the safety and security of all our people, she said.

Former Economic Development Minister Basil Rajapaksa said yesterday there was an urgent to form a new political front in the country.
Mr. Rajapaksa, who served as a key minister in former President Mahinda Rajapaksas Cabinet said the main opposition had voted in favour of the 2016 budget though it was against the people's aspirations.
There is no actual opposition in Parliament. So, the need for a new political front is badly felt. Even those who supported the United National Party (UNP) and Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna(JVP) are now disillusioned, he said.(Kelum Bandara)

New Kelani Bridge: construction work to begin soon
	
Construction work of the elevated bridge parallel to the Kelani Bridge is scheduled to commence this year with the Road Development Authority (RDA) ready to call for tenders soon.
Sources said officials were acquiring land on either side of the river for the bridge which is to be wider than the existing one.
RDA Director General M.P.K.L. Gunaratne pointed out that the new bridge would be the first construction for the governments plans to build an elevated highway from Dematagoda which exits at the Colombo Port and Katunayake Expressway.
He mentioned that there were a number of protests against the acquisition of land, but the RDA was moving ahead with the project.
The elevated bridge would relocate 400 families along with a number of high tension power cables in the project area, the Road Development Authority (RDA) mentioned.
The bridge which is to function as the gateway to Colombo, collectively with the elevated highway, will help ease the traffic congestion within Colombo city limits and the Peliyagoda area.
Mr. Gunaratne said the government anticipated that the elevated highways would be a major part of the solution to the ever-increasing traffic congestion in Colombo and suburban areas such as Battaramulla and Rajagiriya.
The RDA stated that the Atomic Energy Agency, National Apprentice and Industrial Training Authority and high tension cables of the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) needed to be relocated in order to facilitate the project, and that measures were being taken to carry out the relocation.(Piyumi Fonseka)
