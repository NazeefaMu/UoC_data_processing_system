DFCC posts healthy balance sheet growth
	
2015 was a year of transformation for DFCC following the amalgamation with DFCC Vardhana Bank and the change in the financial year-end to December 31 from March 31.
The performance reported is for nine months from April 2015 to December 2015 as against that of the previous full year. Net profit after tax as at December 31, 2015 was Rs.1,642 million (group) and Rs.1,068 million (bank) while that for FYE March 2015 was Rs.4,439 million and Rs.3,240 million, respectively.?
However, there were several exceptional items in both periods which distort the comparison. FYE 31 March 2015 included substantial one-off capital gains and impairment reversals, while the period ended December 31, 2015 entailed significant non-recurrent expenses incurred during the amalgamation for items such as systems integration and data migration.?
The change of the financial year meant that the bank incurred an additional taxation charge based on the full year, even though results were for nine months. Also, substantial dividend income, which accrues in the first quarter of the calendar year, could not be included.
Meanwhile, total assets grew by 17 percent to Rs.247,109 million as at December 31, 2015 from Rs.210,610 million as at March 31, 2015. This included a robust credit portfolio growth of 18 percent to Rs.171,111 million from Rs.144,896 million. At the same time credit quality was not compromised. The ratio of impaired loans to total loans for December 31, 2015 was 5.1 percent compared to 6.1 percent for March 31, 2015, indicating a credit quality improvement. ?Close monitoring drove down the bank?s ratio of impaired loans to total loans as well as its regulatory non-performing loan ratio, with the latter improving to 3.7 percent as at December 31, 2015 from 4.3 percent as at March 31, 2015. Its balance sheet strength is demonstrated by a group Tier 1 capital adequacy ratio of 15.4 percent and a total capital adequacy ratio of 15.3 percent making DFCC Bank one of the highest capitalised banks in the industry. CEO Arjun Fernando commented, ?While 2015 was a transformative year for DFCC, the amalgamation with Vardhana has laid the foundation for the bank to take on the competition. We are therefore confident of resuming our normal growth trajectory in 2016 and beyond.?

285 drivers held for noise pollution
	
Two hundred and eighty five drivers have been held by the Environmental Police Unit of the Central Environmental Authority (CEA) during a noise pollution control programme carried out recently, CEA Chairman Lal Dharmasiri said yesterday.
The programme held in collaboration with the Motor Traffic Department aimed at creating awareness on the use of extra vehicle horns.
In total, 338 vehicles have undergone tests during noise pollution control programmes held in Pettah, Galle, Kandy, Ratnapura, Anuradhapura and Ratmalana, he said.
The CEA Chairman stated that the driving licenses of 285 drivers have been seized, and they have been instructed to remove the extra vehicle horns within a given period of time in order to retrieve their licenses.
?It is disturbing and upsetting road users, including pedestrians. Loud horns are a major contributor to noise pollution. The bus drivers are the worst.
According to the law, drivers cannot toot horns with sound levels exceeding 105 decibels within a range of two metres. All the drivers we held exceeded the standard sound levels,? he said. (Piyumi Fonseka)

If emergency ambulance service is launched SL would come under RAW influence: Wimal
	
National Freedom Front (NFF) Leader MP Wimal Weerawansa today warned that spies representing the Indian Intelligence Agency (RAW) would have free reign to come to Sri Lanka if an Indian Emergency Ambulance Service was allowed to come into the country.
?Most of those recruited for the proposed Ambulance Service would be in favour of India. It will be operated countrywide and therefore, spies from RAW would be able to gather details of persons living in areas that they operate and create a database,? he said.
He said India has the worst health service in the world and as such calling for an Ambulance Service to be run by them was absurd. ?There is no quality emergency ambulance service or quality roads in India,? he said.
He said the Health Ministry would have no control over the ambulance service once it was launched as the ownership of the service would be theirs.
MP Weerawansa said it was evident that government planned to sacrifice the Sri Lankan economy to please 'big brother' India and that those who try to object were being labelled traitors. He said all the government needed to do was to give its giant neighbour the slightest opening and it would grab the chance with both hands to the detriment of Sri Lanka. (Chaturanga Pradeep)

Kerry lauds SL?s efforts to address regional issues
	
US State Secretary John Kerry on Thursday said it was noteworthy to mention the efforts made by the Sri Lankan Government to address regional issues and most importantly to make peace in its own country.
While welcoming Foreign Minister Managala Samaraweera to the US to take part in the US-Sri Lanka Partnership Dialogue, which will be led by UN Under Secretary Tom Shannon, Kerry also congratulated Sri Lanka for continuing steps towards reconciliation.
?I?m very happy to welcome my friend Mangala Samaraweera here, the foreign minister of Sri Lanka. I had wonderful occasion to visit with him in Sri Lanka and I want to congratulate the Government of Sri Lanka for their very impressive continuing steps towards reconciliation. We are very much looking forward to defining the roadmap ahead for continued progress,? he said.
Meanwhile, Foreign Minister Samaraweera recalled the visit undertaken by State Secretary Kerry to Sri Lanka, the first visit by a US Secretary of State in 43 years, the cabinet-level visit of Samantha Power last May and many other visits by high-level officials of the State Department.
?This has elevated what has always been a very cordial relationship to what I would call a very special friendship between the US and Sri Lanka. That is why I?m looking forward for the inaugural meeting of the US-Sri Lanka Partnership Dialogue, which I?m sure, will further strengthen and broaden the relationship between our two countries,? he said.

Magistrate orders that Sicille's jewellery be valued
	
Colombo chief magistrate Gihan Pilapitiya ordered the CID yesterday to obtain a valuation certificate from the National Gem and Jewellery Authority concerning the gold jewellery belonging to Sicille Kotelawala (that was kept in a safe deposit box) in order to auction it.
Sicille Kotelawala is on remand on a charge of defrauding a sum of Rs 4.3 million belonging the depositors of the F&G Property Developers.
The magistrate made the order having considered the submissions by the attorneys representing the aggrieved parties that the jewellery be sold at an auction and the funds realised paid to the depositors.
The CID had had opened the safe deposit locker at the Union Place Branch of the Peoples Bank (in Colombo 2) on 27.09.2010 and a report had been submitted to Court.
Sicille Kotelawala was produced in Court by prisons officials yesterday.
The magistrate re-remanded Sicille Kotelawela till March 9.
The CID informed Court that it was not possible to record a statement from the suspect due to her critical health condition and, therefore, it needed more time to record her statement and also get the opinion of the Attorney General regarding the case. (Shehan Chamika Silva)

Malinga hints at retirement post World T20
	
Lasith Malinga dropped a hint that World T20 in India in March-April could be his last as far as international cricket is concerned. The Sri Lanka T20 captain, who recovered from a knee injury to return to action in the Asia Cup, said he has been playing through pain and sounded unsure of the future.
?I?m not happy. (For the) last three months I didn?t bowl a single ball. Just the last two days in the nets. But the result I am very happy. But I think I have to do more for the team. We have to play very tough teams in the future. I have (made a) come back, but I don?t know about the next day. But I will try my best. It was not my 100 per cent. Maybe 60-70 per cent. But I still managed to bowl the yorkers and slower balls. But the team expects more than that from me,? Malinga said after Sri Lanka?s 14-run win over UAE in their Asia Cup opening game on Thursday.
The 32-year-old returned with 4/26 to take the Man of the Match award but in the post-match presser, he spoke about his injury.
?I had a very bad injury in the knee. The same thing happened in 2008. I had to get two years? rest for it to recover. Same injury has happened on the other leg. But this is not the time to rest. We have the World Cup and I am the experienced bowler in the national team in the T20 format. So whatever I can do ? use painkiller or injection or whatever ? this is the end of my career. So if I can do something for the team, I want to do the best I can for my team in these last few years or few months.? Injury had been the reason why Malinga hung up his Test boots in 2010. He hasn?t played ODIs either since November last year. A very popular cricketer, home and abroad, the World T20 is likely to be his swansong.(The Indian Express)

MR rejects Ranjan's accusations over luxury airplane cubicle
	
Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa today rejected allegations made by Minister Ranjan Ramanayake that Mr. Rajapaksa had ordered a luxury cubicle worth four million US Dollars to be fixed onto aircraft for his comfort.
?
The full statement said:
Parliamentarian Ranjan Ramanayake has told a media conference that former President Mahinda Rajapaksa had ordered a luxury cubicle worth four million US Dollars to be fixed onto aircraft used by him and since the agreement that has been signed, President Sirisena was unable to reverse the order.
Mr. Ramanayake further stated that it was because of such abuse of power that former president Rajapaksa had to face various commissions of inquiry today.
During the last presidential election campaign, President Rajapaksa was falsely accused of having ordered a private plane for himself. Now they say fairly truthfully, that this was only a kit to convert a part of an ordinary airliner into a luxury cubicle. These are VIP conversion kits which can be installed after removing several seats in commercial airliners and are supplied free as a complimentary accessory when new commercial passenger planes are ordered. Airbus Industries mentions a value for this conversion kit only to give the customer an idea of the value of the complimentary kit. The customer can?t ask for the money instead of the complimentary accessory.
Though Mr. Ramanayake has said that the President of the USA and the Sultan of Brunei also used similar units on their planes, it is not true. The American President travels in an official plane and the Sultan of Brunei has many private planes. They don?t travel on commercial airlines fitted with conversion kits.
It is not correct to say that the government cannot reverse the order for this VIP kit. Any customer can turn down the offer of a complimentary accessory if he does not need it. It seems to be that the present leaders now wish to avail themselves of the comfort of this VIP kit for their foreign travels and are trying to make excuses for accepting it by saying that the agreement prevented them from turning it down. All those who value yahapalanaya principles should ensure that the government flatly refuses to accept this complimentary VIP conversion kit and even if it is sent to Sri Lanka with the new planes, it should be returned to Airbus Industries forthwith."

Nation Lanka Finance announces rights issue to raise Rs.502mn
	
Nation Lanka Finance (NLF) has announced a rights issue to raise Rs.502 million to support the company?s core capital requirement and ensure its compliance with regulations that have been stipulated by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL).?
The investment to increase core capital will help improve the company?s overall liquidity whilst supporting its continued operational growth and expansion. The proposed rights issue will be held on the basis of 02:01 at Rs.1 per share, with a total of 502,326,522 ordinary shares being offered to the existing shareholders of the company.
The core capital base of the company in the financial quarter ending September 30, 2015 was recorded at Rs.72 million and given that the rights issue is fully subscribed, the capital base by March 31, 2016 is expected to increase to Rs.747 million with the expected operational profits. (The minimal capital requirement set by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka is Rs.400 million).
Commenting on the company?s upcoming rights issue, Nation Lanka Finance CEO Jayantha Perera stated, ?The capital infusion provided by this rights issue will help Nation Lanka Finance to boost its performance in the current financial year and will strengthen the company?s core capital base, whilst ensuring its compliance with the stipulated Tier I capital adequacy ratio set by the CBSL. This issuance will augur well for the company?s continued growth and will enable us to retain our current position of profitability. Our focus on compliance is also part of our long-term strategy to establish Nation Lanka Finance as a reliable, dynamic and leading force in the financial services industry.?
Commenting on how the rights issue would be handled in the event of an under subscription, Perera stated, ?We are confident that this will not be the case. However, in the event that the rights issue is not fully subscribed, the company will take the shortfall into consideration and consolidate on profitability to strengthen the core capital base and gradually improve liquidity. This rights issue was recognized as an important part of our expansion and was unanimously approved at the Extraordinary General Meeting (EGM), which was held on February 10, 2016. As we look ahead to the future, Nation Lanka Finance will continue to establish itself as an organisation whose board of directors and management remain completely committed towards ensuring shareholder wealth maximization.?

## Title: NDB Bank shakes up industry with ?Shake-Banking?

NDB Bank shakes up industry with ?Shake-Banking?
	
?
Sri Lanka?s development-oriented commercial bank, National Development Bank PLC (NDB) recently launched its next generation of digitally-enabled mobile banking platform ? ?Shake-Banking? ? which offers many industry firsts, officials from the bank said.?
?We have invested heavily on our digital journey and this is the first part of that journey where we are rolling out our mobile banking,? said the bank?s Retail Banking Vice President Darshana Ratnayake without disclosing its financial commitment.?
NDB is the latest entrant into the fastest trending mobile banking sphere in Sri Lanka but its attractive features will undoubtedly woo many customers into the bank while the competitors will have to rethink their models to either match or beat the product. ??
The mobile app will also enable the bank to attract the much-needed low-cost funds ? current and savings accounts (CASA) ? into the bank as the features will entice the retail and small and medium enterprise (SME) clients the most.
CASA is one of three key indicators the bank?s Chief Executive Officer Rajendra Theagarajah monitors in his fight against narrowing margins among increasing fee-based incomes-to-net interest income and lowering cost-to-income ratio being the other two. ?Among the unique features is the easiest on boarding to the app without having to register via filling forms and visiting branches. Instead, the customer can use his/her existing user ID and password of the debit card, credit card or the Internet banking to complete the registration.
The app is available on Android, Apple iOS and Windows.
?This is the first mobile banking facility developed by any bank that the customers can get themselves on boarded without filling forms, without going to a branch, without having to go through the hassle of getting your own user ID and password,? Ratnayake told an investor forum held last week.?
Meanwhile, for those who do not have any of the above facilities ? pass book account holders ? too could get themselves on boarded the state-of-the-art mobile app by stepping in to an NDB branch.?
In order to make it easier for a customer to locate a closest branch, the app is connected to Google maps ? the first bank to connect its branches and ATMs to Google maps, he added. ?
Another enticer of the app is that the smartphone shows all the latest offers and discounts offered by the bank?s credit cards for the day whenever the phone is shaken even before the account is logged in.
Further, if the customer shakes his/her phone while logged in, it displays the balances of all your accounts ? which probably the reason to brand the product as ?Shake-Banking?. ?Probably the biggest hassle-free feature of the app is that it could transfer funds between NDB account holders using only the beneficiary?s mobile number, the feature which is called ?Pay-To-Mobile?.
?If an NDB customer wants to send money to another NDB customer, I don?t need to know the beneficiary?s account number. I just need to use the beneficiary?s phone number from my phone number list and I transfer money to that person as his phone number is linked to his account and goes straight to his primary account,? Ratnayake explained. ?Meanwhile, the fund transfers to the third party accounts are also made through a soft token. This also takes away the hassle of having to remember more than one password in making third party transfers.?
?What that means is, one time password is pushed from the centre through our registered phone number (which) you need to use to effect the transfer. That means, you don?t have to carry a token or remember another pin,? he remarked. ?Further the app user can top up his/her phone ? pre-paid or post-paid ?through the app once the number is registered, again through a self-registration process via the app itself, a sensible value addition. ?Furthermore, the NDB mobile app has the ability to settle other banks? credit cards which is available through competitor apps too. ??For me the best feature of this mobile app is the ability to switch on and off you debit or credit cards,? ?This is because even if someone?s debit or credit card is stolen with the pin number, nobody can use the card as you have blocked your card/s via the app,? Ratnayake added.?
NDB has also broken the conventional method of calling the card centre to activate the new card as the activation is made possible via the app.?
Besides the above, the app also enables the user to monitor the online balance of the credit card/s and also make utility bill payments via the mobile app.?

Chairman of the National Trade Union Centre (NTUC) K.D. Lalkantha stated that they would defeat the government?s move to sign the Indo-Sri Lanka Economic and Technology Cooperation Framework Agreement (ECTA) if it is to be finalized despite opposition from various quarters.
Addressing a media briefing in Colombo, Mr. Lalkantha said; ?Mr. Ranil Wickremesinghe said the present regime were going to sign the ETCA at any cost as they had the the numbers in Parliament. Former president Mahinda Rajapaksa?s regime was more powerful than Mr. Wickremesinghe?s. Therefore I suggest that he look at what happened to the previous regime and learn from their mistakes when running the affairs of government.?
Further he pointed out that at present the amount of foreign goods coming into the country has meant that there was very little space for the local manufacturers, adding, the local services sector would also suffer if foreign parties were allowed to enter into the local market. ?Even though the government had assured us that there won?t be any harm done to professionals, it is crystal clear that ECTA will be a threat to the local services sector. If the government signs the ETCA the local services sector would be also controlled by foreigners,? he added. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)

Style your hair ? it?s cheaper than plastic surgery or expensive make-up
	
Coco Chanel once said that a woman who cuts her hair is about to change her life.?I agree, somewhat. I just don?t think the decision to change your life should happen?in one single moment ? perpetually indecisive and constantly changing, I think a girl?should have the flexibility of making a decision like that every day, if she chooses to.?Growing up, I always wanted to look more elfin and angular. My face is naturally?round, so I used to smack my hair on my cheeks and try to hide the extra chubbiness?until I was old enough to do something about it.?
I vowed to get some cheekbone?enhancing surgery. When I did get old enough, I was too broke to afford surgery ? so?I put on lots of blush and sat through around 6 hours of make-up tutorials on?contouring followed by a very expensive trip to the cosmetics store.?Until one day, a friend told me to pull my hair back off my face and clip my hair up?into a high ponytail ? the sort you see on perfectly petite-faced dolls. After much?debate, struggling and an incident involving some pillow throwing and threats to?end our friendship ? I gave in. 
I gave in and did something so counter-intuitive; it?took me a full two hours to even believe my eyes afterwards.?But it worked. Moving my hair away from my rounded face allowed my ears to peek?out and give me some natural depth to an otherwise flat and full surface. Pulling my?hair up instead of down (where I could flick it back over my shoulder and bury my?cheeks in, causing a reflexive hunch that always made me look even more pudgy),?raised my temples ? giving my eyes an upwards slant, which gave the illusion of a?longer face and yes, cheekbones.One hairstyle. One little slick up and elegant ponytail cost me a whole lot less than?three bags of cosmetics or one hefty cosmetic surgery bill.

I?m addicted now to finding what styles?transform my face shape, change up my look ? going from femme fatale to boss lady,?flirty fun date to hippie chic.
?And that?s the lesson here, I think. We stick to what we know because we?re too?afraid to try anything else. We?re so settled and comfortable and scared that we?deny ourselves the chance to enjoy what we have to the fullest. Who knew hair?could be more than a safety blanket to hide half my face in while it hangs limp over?my shoulders? Who knew it was more effective than make-up in enhancing my face?and giving me so much confidence? ?Girls, hair is your secret weapon ? it?s versatile?and can change as and when you do.

Union Bank records impressive growth in 2015
	
Union Bank of Colombo PLC (UBC) and its subsidiaries concluded the year 2015 with a notable business performance; reflected by a 226 percent increase in post-tax profit that signals the strong growth momentum mobilised within the year.?
?
Core banking growth and profitability?
The principal source of income from the bank?s fund-based operations escalated to Rs.2,022 million in 2015. This is an increase of Rs.259 million or 15 percent compared to Rs.1,763 million recorded in the previous year. It is a noteworthy achievement, given the substantial reduction in interest spreads experienced by the bank during the year.
Net interest margins dropped due to decreasing spreads and increased investments made in unit trusts during the year. Return on the unit trust investments are reflected under net trading income of the bank.
The bank?s loans and advances stood at Rs.40,095 million as at 2015 year-end. This is a Rs.14,151 million (55 percent) growth in comparison to the previous year, and is the highest absolute growth achieved by the bank since its inception.
The composition of loans and advances of the bank changed in line with its new strategic positioning, as a fully-fledged commercial bank serving a wider clientele including corporate, SME and retail banking segments. Corporate banking contributed to the highest portion of the growth, given that the bank employed focused efforts to strengthen its corporate loan book in 2015, in an endeavour to grow fee and commission income.
UBC revamped its retail banking proposition in 2015, with a broader product spectrum aided by aggressive network growth; while consciously narrowing the pawning portfolio to reduce the risk appetite. The deposits base of UBC stood at Rs.37,652 million as at year-end. This is a Rs.9,844 million (35 percent) growth in comparison to 2014. The growth in fixed deposits was recorded as Rs.7,719 million.?
The bank focused on an aggressive current and savings accounts (CASA) drive which was supported by several strategic initiatives such as the expansion of the off-site ATM network, introduction of debit cards, setting up a dedicated sales force and rebranding the branch outlook. CASA recorded a growth of 33 percent in comparison to 2014.?
The fee and commission income of the bank was Rs.226 million which translates to an year-on-year growth of 15 percent. This was mainly attributed to the increase in fee and commission income from loans, cards, trade and remittances. The bank made significant efforts to strengthen its fee and commission-based businesses, and plans to leverage the key enablers that were established during 2015. ?

Mr. Wijepala told Daily Mirror that the LCPP would begin functioning from tomorrow and it was expected to reach the usual capacity by Monday and until then the public were requested to use electricity wisely.
?We have a manageable capacity until the LCPP?s power generation resumes operations. Consumers are advised to switch off air conditioners and refrigerators between the peak hours of 6pm and 10pm,? he said. (Piyumi Fonseka)
