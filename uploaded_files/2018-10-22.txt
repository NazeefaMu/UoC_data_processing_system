Arrested Indian, a victim of SL's political insecurity: Brother
	
The family of the Indian arrested in Sri Lanka in connection with the alleged plot to assassinate President Maithripala Sirisena, says he should be released immediately as he is a victim of the political insecurity in Sri Lanka.
?This is a fabricated case. My elder brother is a victim of political insecurity in Sri Lanka,? the 52-year-old brother of the man who was identified as M. Thomas, told Indian Express.
The brother said anyone who interacted with Thomas would know that he is not of sound mind and has a physical disability.
The brother, a retired civil engineer, said he was in touch with Sri Lankan and Indian authorities to find out more about his brother?s present condition.
He said he wasn?t in regular contact with Thomas and that they last spoke a week before his arrest. ?Thomas then said his life was in danger and that he was surrounded by enemies,? he said.
He said that on September 25, Indian officials visited him and told him that Thomas had been arrested in Sri Lanka for overstaying his tourist visa. He said the Indian officials wanted to see Thomas?s Aadhaar card.
The brother said Thomas, who had exhibited ?severe symptoms of mental illness? since an accident in 1997 in which he sustained a head injury, ?needs treatment, not jail?.
He said that Thomas worked as an office assistant-cum-accountant for several years in the Mumbai office of the Airports Authority of India and used to live in Andheri. In 1992, he shifted to an AAI office in Kerala.
For reasons the brother said were unclear to him, the AAI gave his job to Thomas?s wife. The husband and wife have been divorced for several years and have a son.
The brother said he last saw Thomas in 2016, after nearly a decade. In 2007, the brother, who was then working in the Middle East, got him a job there, ?but he quit after a few months?.
After that, he met Thomas only in 2016, when he showed up at his Mumbai house and lived there for a few months. ?He had a property matter in the south.
He owned a seven-room bungalow there and feared that his wife would take the property away. We travelled together to Kerala to clear his property tax,? the brother said.
Thomas, the brother said, disappeared soon after, and the next he heard from him was in the beginning of 2017, when he called to say he was in Sri Lanka.
?He sounded happy. He asked me to come to Colombo,? said his younger brother, adding that he never asked him how he was supporting himself, where he lived or what he did.
In the months that followed, the two kept in touch through ?missed calls?.
?I knew he had no money, so sometimes I would call him back when I got a missed call from him. When I spoke to him last, in the third week of September, he said he had a lot of enemies. I told him to come back, or to report to the police or the Indian embassy there. As usual, our conversation ended abruptly,? the brother said.
The brother said he was in touch with Indian and Sri Lankan officials. ?But I haven?t had a chance to speak to my brother yet. Indian officials were also not allowed to meet him. They asked me to visit Colombo but I am unwell. I request them to take his illness into consideration and drop all false charges against him. If they cannot release him immediately, I hope they will make sure that he gets mental health treatment,? the brother said.
He said he had asked the Sri Lankan authorities to send a photograph of Thomas so that he can be sure that it is his brother they have arrested, as ?his passport was stolen a few years ago, and he got a new one made only two years ago?.

Assassinations, Disappearances, Information Wars Coming chaos in International Politics
	
?
?
fghan administration of President Ashraf Ghani suffered a massive blow when Chief of Police in the volatile Afghan district of Kandahar Abdul Raziz, a fierce opponent and bulwark against the Taliban was assassinated. The attack critically injured the Governor of Kandhar Zalmay Wesa creating a massive power vacuum in an already faltering structure of governance in Afghanistan. 17 years into the war in Afghanistan since 9/11,Taliban roughly controls nearly as much territory as it did before 9/11.
Sri Lanka and regional press was inundated with the narrative of an RAW led assassinated plot of the incumbent President and the global media spotlight honing on the disappearance and potential assassination of a dissident Saudi journalist Jamal Khashogi, a columnist in exile working for the Washington Post owned by tech powerhouse Amazon.com
Sri Lanka-India relations went from normal to an emergency mode within the span of 24 hours with reports that the Sri Lankan President has made remarks of a potential RAW backed plot to assassinate him during a cabinet briefing. While both governments have managed to minimize the fall out the political narratives are hard to control. All these are incidents of a world in flux and an international order being undone and yet to be remade.
Liberal disorder and toxic information?
This article does not focus on the authenticity of the actual events or intend to take a deep dive on dissecting these events separately. Instead it is?an attempt to build a case on the information disorder and emergence of powerful political events and narratives around them. The core argument is located on the correlation between global disorder and disinformation campaigns both undermines democratic societies, democratic values and emboldens authoritarian powers.?
Authoritarian tendencies within democracies and established authoritarian powers have begun alarming campaigns of intimidation. These campaigns include disappearances of political rivals, rights activists, targeting is becoming increasing trans-border in nature and is fully exploiting the decaying institutional structure of the so called liberal world.? Grace Meng, the wife of? Interpol Chief Meng Hongwei who recently resigned under mysterious circumstances while in his home soil in China, claims he is no longer alive. Hongwei served as President of Interpol from 2016 till his detention in China operating from Interpol office in Paris. Reports from China claim that, he is detained under the sweeping anti-corruption drive led by President Xi Jinping.
?
Info-Wars?
The most alarming aspect of this tendency of disappearances, assassinations comes in the faltering of that Post World War II order as a result of indifference towards liberal values by the architects of the global system. Analysts argue that the liberal order was a guise to advance the interest of the American hegemonic project. Thus dictators and illiberal allies were nurtured and today the US is no longer able to control the monsters of its own creation. As a consequence the US is sounding alarm bells of how weaponized narratives are undermining their position in the world backed by academic, policy research and political statements coming from both aisles of its political spectrum.?
?
	Taliban roughly controls nearly as much territory as it did before 9/11
	
	
	Meng Hongwei?s wife claims her husband is no longer alive
	
	
	Prince Salman saw Jamal Khashoogi as a threat to the Kingdom?
	
Last week Harvard University?s key think tank for International politics and security released a report titled, ??Can democracy survive in the information Age??? looks at weaponization of information and the increasing vulnerability of democratic politics and political processes. The report argues, key information technologies have evolved quickly over the past five years and been weaponized against democracies. The trajectory of data-driven technologies, including machine learning and other aspects of artificial intelligence, will increase the scale, complexity and effectiveness of adversary information operations?.?
While Harvard University report looks at players such as Russia and Saudi Arabia, the US Vice President Mike Pence, in a landmark speech that was delivered at the conservative think tank, the Hudson Institute a few weeks back, in which he also made a remark about Sri Lanka being a military outpost for the Chinese PLA Navy, further mentioned that China has initiated an unprecedented effort to influence American public opinion, the 2018 elections, and the environment leading into the 2020 presidential elections?. He claimed that China wanted a different president in 2020.
?
Saudi Arabia and its trans boundary excursions?
Ever since Saudi Arabia?s crown prince Mohammed bin Salman started purging rival royals and engaging in an adversarial relationship with Qatar, his ability to target dissident Saudi nationals and any element of Qatari power is a classic case study to understand the erosion of liberal institutional safeguards in global politics.?
The disappearance of Khashogi while visiting the Saudi consulate in Istanbul needs to be revisited with the focus of why such cases have significant international political implications. The question is how did Khashogi, a longtime close confidante of the Saudi Royal Family before becoming a critique of the regime became a prime target of the crown prince. He was part of the larger media operations of the Al Saud family and he had been involved in intelligence operations on behalf of the house of Saud. He was an avid supporter of the Mujahedeen movement which fought Soviet Union in Afghanistan backed by the CIA and was one of the first people to interview Osama bi Laden during the war against Soviet Union and cut his ties with Bin laden in aftermath of the 9/11 attacks.?
?
?
	US Vice President Mike Pence remarked SL being a military outpost for Chinese PLA Navy
	
	
	Indo-SL relations suffered mild crack after suspected RAW involvment to assassinate SL President?
	
His relations with the house of Saud were soured with Prince Salman who saw him as a threat to the Kingdom because of his relationship and support to the Muslim Brotherhood which Salman despises and perceives to be a front that advances interests of his arch rival Qatar. It was in this context Khashogi flees to the US and begins his stint as a columnist for the Jeff Bezos-owned Washington Post since 2017. Thus the Saudi-Qatari tensions have led Saudi Arabia to pursue multiple forms of aggression against both regime critics and Saudis who are seen as sympathetic to Qatar, thus the inability to contain such acts of aggression is a further hallmark of the decaying liberal order and institutions. The lesser known incidents of Saudi operations in the information sphere should also be highlighted.?
The University of Toronto-based cyber research establishment the Citizenlabwhich was instrumental in uncovering the alleged China-led Ghostnet operation in 2009 that targeted Tibetan nationals including the Dalai Lama online, recently reported on the increasing use of sophisticated spy wear by the Saudi administration. This spy wear has the capability to totally compromise an individual?s internet identity and devices enabling the Saudi regime to track critics of the regime globally, the spy wear known as Pegasus ironically was developed by the Israeli cyber weapons developer NSO Group.
Citizenlab report identifies how Saudi connected operator was able to use Pegasus to infiltrate and takeover the cellular phone of Omar Abdulaziz, a Saudi activist and Canadian permanent resident. Abdulaziz? is an outspoken critic of the current Saudi regime and he runs a political satire on YouTube that has more than million followers and thus has earned the ire of the Saudi regime. The report further reveals this same operator has monitoring targets across Bahrain, Canada, Egypt, France, Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco, Qatar, Turkey and the UK
?
Fallout from toxic information and global disorder?
The most significant socio political revolution of the 21st century is the merger of cyber culture into the larger political eco system creating informational narratives that spread via social media with no or real need for accuracy checks or need for authenticity. Thus political processes that prevented catastrophic failures of governance are indeed undermined, the term global governance is now an outcast in the Trump administration?s lexicon. Countries like Sri Lanka riding in the midst of this turmoil should need a foreign and national security policy that has strategic communication as an integral aspect and pillar if we do not adapt soon to these emerging challenges as the two mini cases discussed in this article are destined to fly blind into the eye of the storm.

BirdSong of Shanmugam
	
?
	"The future star of Sinhala pop music was discovered by him, and not by any of the big names??
	
	
	He migrated to Denmark after the 1983 riots
	
	
	He produced Mohideen Baig hit song Buddhang Saranang Gachchami"
	
?
?
It is hard to imagine singing star and 70s-80s heartthrob Milton Mallawarcchchi was unable to find a buyer for his record containing the hit Ivuru Thala. But musical history has such shocks in store for us, buried in the annals of time.
The name of Subramanium Shanmugam may not sound familiar to most people unless someone from a previous generation remembers the Shans Record label from the 1970s.
The future star of Sinhala pop music was discovered by him, and not by any of the big names of the then-thriving recording industry.
Denmark Shan, as he prefers to be called, arrived in India with his family as a refugee following the July 1983 riots. In 1985, he migrated to Denmark.
Back in Sri Lanka recently, he spoke to the Daily Mirror about his life, its ups and downs, and his life as a producer of records, cassette tapes and films in Sri Lanka and in India.
?Now I think what happened in July 1983 has actually done good to me,? he smiles. ?If that didn?t happen, I wouldn?t be in Denmark now.?
His daughter is an eye surgeon today, the first among Sri Lankan Tamil refugees to graduate as a medical doctor. In the riots, he lost his home and all belongings, but no loved ones. You can see that he isn?t inclined to mope. Overall, life has been good to him and this is reflected in his positive attitude and sunny smile.
Denmark Shan was born in 1942 in Karainagar, Jaffna. His father was an Apothecary and Shan attended the Kopai Christian College.
He discovered a talent for singing early in his life. But conventional wisdom demanded a career other than in the arts. Selected to study Agriculture at the Peradeniya University, he found it rather boring and left without graduating. He wanted to be a composer of music.
He did become one, even though he didn?t play any instruments and didn?t know scales or music theory. But it wasn?t by composing music that he began to earn a living.
He had the luck to be associated with the film industry right from the start. His first job was at a Ceylon Theatres subsidiary called Ceylon Studios. Lester James Pieris? Golu Hadawatha was being filmed there at the time.
Working there, he met the best-known film directors of that time ? Lester, K. A. W. Perera and Amaranath Jayathilake, as well as actors and singers, including H. R. Jothipala.
This was followed by a job at the Imperial Talkies Company, which owned the Imperial Cinema at Panadura. Shan was put in charge of the cinema. During this time, he composed his first successful songs. His first record, a 45 rpm, contained three songs and a baila instrumental. As he could not play instruments, he hired a musician to note down the melody as it came to him.
Sung by H. R. Jothipala, these three songs ? Mal Sara Mal Dunne, Neela Desa Soya, and Amuthuma Reyaki became hits overnight.
This success was followed by more records. The second record contained the song On Chili Chili by Jothipala.
The quantity was small but he was successful with each undertaking, so much so that Gerald Wickremasooriya, king of the Sinhala pop recording business at the time, once joked that the only rival he feared was this little-known composer-entrepreneur from Jaffna.
The three hit songs in that first Shan Label record were written by Karunaratne Abeysekara. When he asked Karu how much he wanted for the lyrics, the most celebrated songwriter of that era modestly asked for ten rupees.
One day, when he was visiting the Sarasavi Studio, Kelaniya, recording engineer Mervyn Rodrigo gave him a 45 rpm record and said it was definitely worth listening to.
Shan recognized at once that this was an unusual voice. Mervyn Rodrigo told him that the relatively unknown new singer was called Milton Mallawarachchi, and he has been trying hard to sell this record of four songs without success.
Incredible as it may sound, one of those four songs was Ivuru Thala, which became one of Milton?s biggest hits.
Shan went immediately to meet Milton Mallawarachchi and said he would buy the four songs.
?
Behind the scene: Shanmugam at shooting; and still from the new production (Above and Below)?
?
?Milton wanted Rs. 3,500 for those four songs and I didn?t argue. There was magic in them,? Shan said with a smile.
Four more Milton Mallawarchchi hits ? Peradila Palagiye Ne, Etha Ran Wiman, Sayuru There and Ma Ha Eda ? followed under the Shan label. These were good years for him. In 1974, he composed the music for the film Kali Yuga Kale.
He had a record outlet at Pettah and produced about 35 records.? When cassette tapes became popular, he became a cassette producer.
He produced the cassette containing Mohideen Baig?s famous song ?Buddhang Saranang Gachchami.?
He then tried his hand at film production and the result was a Tamil film ? Illaya Nila (New Moon) starring Gamini Fonseka and Tamil actors Deepa and Thyagarajan.
?
It was a colour film and was processed in Hong Kong. Celebrated Indian playback singer S. P. Balasubramaniam came to Colombo to record a song for it. The film was destroyed in the 1983 riots and was never screened.
That was a turning point. Going to India as a refugee with his family, he was helped by Balasubramaniam to produce a cassette. The singer didn?t charge a cent for his efforts. But he didn?t feel settled down in India and felt between two worlds when the opportunity to migrate to Denmark came.
Recently back in Sri Lanka for a visit, he was busy visiting old friends. While talking, he pulled out a single EP, his first with the three Jothipala hits. Everything else was destroyed during the riots, and now he?s looking for those other Shan label records, which entertained thousands in this country. Shan is currently involved in a film production in Sri Lanka.

CID arrests SLC Chief Financial Officer
	
Sri Lanka Cricket's (SLC) Chief Financial Officer Wimal Nandika Dissanayake was arrested by the CID today in connection with an alleged financial fraud of USD 187,084, Police Spokesman Ruwan Gunasekera said.
SP Gunasekara said the officer was arrested after SLC CEO Ashley De Silva filed a complaint with the Police over a fraudulent incident of SLC?s Media Rights Sponsorship Funds being transferred to an offshore account.
The investigation into the complaint was then handed over to the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) by IGP Pujith Jayasundara.
Sony Television is the Media Rights Sponsor of the SLC since 2013. Sony had made the payment to the SLC in three stages when there was a cricket tournament. Accordingly, Sony had made a 50 per cent payment before the start of the tournament while another 35 per cent had paid when a team arrives and the remaining 15 per cent at the end of the tournament.
The Spokesman said the Chief Financial Officer was arrested over alleged financial fraud occurred during the South African tour in Sri Lanka in July this year.
He said Sony television had made 85 per cent payment to the SLC. But the suspect financial officer had informed Sony company to deposit the 15 per cent payment (USD 187,084) to a private account in USA. Sony had made the payment accordingly.
Afterwards, the suspect had again asked Sony television company to deposit 50 per cent payment of the Media Rights Sponsorship funds of the ongoing bilateral series between Sri Lanka and England, to the offshore account.
Sony, which had not made the deposit to the offshore account, had informed the SLC.
The suspect was arrested at his residence in Homagama. He is to be produced at the Fort Magistrate's court tomorrow (23)?(Darshana Sanjeewa)

## Title: DEMAND FOR COMMUNAL REPRESENTATION IGNITED COMMUNALISM

DEMAND FOR COMMUNAL REPRESENTATION IGNITED COMMUNALISM
	
ommunal Politics have played havoc in the political platform of Sri Lanka for a number of decades. Although the organized left movement in the country and the wise leaders of many political parties have advocated persistently against communalism and racial hatred, it has not died down significantly. Not only in Sri Lanka, even our closest neighbour, India is also still suffering from the same disease-in some of the states in India it has developed into a cancerous situation.?
In Sri Lanka, although the three main languages have been officially accepted as state languages and provincial councils have become part and parcel of the constitution and further several other measures have been taken by various governments to ameliorate the grievances of the affected people, the cancer of communalism is still surviving here, although on a low? level compared to the past. As a student of politics, I thought I should go into the deep to find out causes of communalism in our motherland.?
In Sri Lankan politics, signs of communalism or the germs of communalism flared up in the 1930s, when the representatives of the British Raj in?then Ceylon introduced and encouraged the ugly method of separating the different communities by nominating representatives to the Legislative Council from each of the major groups-low country Sinhalese, up-country Kandyan Sinhalese, Ceylon Tamils, Muslims, Burghers, and also the local British. Historical records reveal that this process came into being in a coherent way in? 1833 and the term ?communal representation? slowly but steadily incarnated into the political vocabulary. Prof. A.J. Wilson, the author of ?SRI LANKAN TAMIL NATIONALISM? says that ?Communalism became a prerogative word to those members of the political class of all the communities who thought in narrow terms of preserving and protecting their particular interests. The British maintained communal representation as an effective method of discerning the views and needs of the different communities?.?
Dr. I. D.S. Weerawardena, who was a lecturer, in the Department of Economics in the University of Peradeniya also held the same views as that of Prof. Wilson over this issue. In his well written thesis, GOVERNMENT AND POLITICS OF CEYLON (1931-1946) he says that Reforms of 1920 were not satisfactory to the leaders of the nationalist movement. Congress boycotted the scheme because it argued communal representation was being perpetuated. The Governor tried to compromise. In 1921, the Congress gave up the boycott. But, the agitation continued.?
This political scenario gradually changed from 1931. From this period onwards, a middle class growing in strength took the upper hand in spearheading the national movement for political reforms. This constitutional agitation for political reforms was worked through several active groups, but more or less belonging to the same social class. Although they had their own differences, they were unanimously agreed on one thing-They stood unitedly for some form of self government. While agitating for self-government, almost all the bourgeois leaders and vested groups were keen on carving out special positions for themselves. To achieve these aims, racial appeals were thoroughly utilized. However, the toiling masses of the society did not show any clear signs to get themselves organized into a forum for social emancipation. However, with the launching of the Donoughmore Constitution of 1931 and emergence of a left movement in the 1930s, this void was successfully filled.?
The Donoughmore Commissioners recommended the complete abolition of communal representation, and the new State Council was to consist of 65 members elected territorial wise, three ex-officio members, and nominated members up to a maximum of 12, if the Governor considered it necessary to make the body more representative. The suffrage was to be extended to all men over 21 years of age and to all women over 35 years who applied to be registered as electors and had resided in the island for a minimum of five years. Income, property and literary qualifications were to be abolished. All these measures taken together, were revolutionary in character. (People in the UK, received the right of universal suffrage only in 1928 and it was a big achievement for Sri Lanka to get this right, only three years after universal suffrage was introduced to UK.
Although the representatives of the majority community accepted the Donoughmore constitution in principle, the minority communities had become seriously apprehensive, and on June 8, 1935, the Tamils, (both Ceylon and Indian) and the Muslims sent a joint statement to the Secretary of State in which they set out their case in considerable detail. They declared that they had declared their opposition to the Donoughmore scheme from the very beginning and had viewed it with growing alarm since it had been put into operation. According to their version, it was a complete and abrupt departure from the principles which had been followed from 1833 to 1923.?
In this joint statement, they have further said that the majority community had been placed in power as an inevitable result of the abolition of communal representation and? adoption of territorial representation. Regarding this attitude of the minorities, The Report of the Soulbury Commission says ?on this analysis, it was the proposal to abolish communal representation that was at the root of the difficulty, for in the existing Legislative Council the minority communities enjoyed, man for man, a greater voting power than the Sinhalese. The majority community would naturally welcome the removal of this disparity?. (Source: SOULBURY COMMISSION REPORT-REPRINTED 1955 - HER MAJESTY?S STATIONERY OFFICE - LONDON).
These antagonistic grievances of the Tamil educated class were represented in the state council by G.G.Ponnambalam from 1934, the year he entered the state council. In 1944, under his leadership the All-Ceylon Tamil Congress was formed. (Up to this stage, the credit should go to this Tamil leader for carrying on a one-man struggle inside the state council to highlight the grievances of the educated Tamil community) However, he very cunningly postulated the principle of balanced representation commonly referred to as ?50-50? - i.e. that half of the seats in the legislature and the executive should be reserved for the minority communities as a defence mechanism against the possibility of the Sinhalese adopting a dominant strategy.?
However, the leader who fought for ?50-50? in the state council and outside, took a U-turn suddenly by joining the cabinet of ministers in 1948, under the leadership of Prime Minister D.S. Senanayake.?
This ?betrayal? of G. G. Ponnambalam, caused a division in the Tamil Congress and finally led to the formation of ILANKAI THAMIL ARASU KADCHI (ITAK). The official name of this political organization was termed as, The Federal Party of the Tamil Speaking People?. S. J. V.Chelvanayagam was unanimously elected as its leader and this charismatic man monopolized the Tamil political platform from 1956 onwards, through his unique organization, until the party coalesced with all other Tamil Wings in 1976, under a new banner - THE TAMIL UNITED LIBERATION FRONT (TULF).
With the formation of TULF and thereafter the taking over of the militant? Tamil movement by the leadership of the LTTE and the prolonged war it manned for nearly three decades, destroyed the foundations of Sri Lanka in several ways. From 1958 onwards, the events that took place in Sri Lankan society in 1971, 1983, 88-89 and during the days of the prolonged war, thousands and thousands of young blood had gone to the drain. All our governments and political leaders who manipulated communal slogans for their own narrow political ends are responsible for this national tragedy.? Singapore, which does not have any rich, valuable natural resources as Sri Lanka, has risen up to the first world from the third, under the able leadership of former senior leader, Lee Kuan Yew, who rallied round all the ethnic groups under one umbrella for his glorious mission. If we want to march forward as a united nation in the challenging 21st century, we must follow the same footsteps. The TNA which was toeing the line of the LTTE during the dark days of the war has expressed its willingness, now, to reach for an amicable political solution within a United Sri Lanka. This opportunity should not be lost and we should not give in to the hands of people like C.V. Vigneswaran to create further tensions by misusing mad communal slogans.?
Communalists of both groups should be isolated and the country?s future must be handed over to patriotic educated youth.?

Displaying LTTE flags in UK: SL wants stern action
	
The Sri Lankan Government had highlighted the British Government the importance of implementing its Terrorism Laws and taking stern action against the four individuals who were arrested for displaying the LTTE flags.
Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranwaka, who was in the UK, had expressed these views when he met with Mark Field, Minister for Asia and Pacific at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office in London.
The minister was referring to the recent incident where Thames Valley Police arrested four activists of the Transnational Government of Tamil Eelam for exhibiting LTTE flags and other insignia.
He said he hoped that British law enforcement authorities would ensure that UK?s own Terrorism Laws were correctly observed and that stern action would be taken against appropriate individuals, as these acts by extremists go directly against the reconciliation processes being encouraged in Sri Lanka by the British government.
Sri Lanka?s UNHRC Resolution, which was co-sponsored with other nations including UK, was also discussed and Minister Ranawaka had reassured that the Sri Lankan government was maintaining its commitment to ensure that all communities enjoyed lasting peace and reconciliation.
At a separate meeting in the House of Lords, Lord Naseby, President of the All Party Parliamentary Group for Sri Lanka was also briefed by Minister Ranawaka on the preparations being discussed in Cabinet for the next UNHRC Geneva Sessions in March 2019.
Lord Naseby had stressed that Sri Lanka?s Govt should adopt a firm stance and mentioned the importance of repealing the current Prevention of Terrorism Act and introducing fresh Counter Terrorism legislation as soon as possible.
The highlight of Minister Ranawaka?s visit was a London Investment forum that attracted a host of British and international companies and institutions to present the considerable business opportunities in Sri Lanka being offered through the implementation of the various Megapolis projects and especially the current development of Port City Colombo.

He cut the umbilical cord by stealing from his mother
	
A millionaire businessman from Polonnaruwa had told his mother that he wanted to pay her back for having brought him into this world and clothed and fed him as a child. He wanted to know from his mother, who lived a comfortable life in Maturata with her husband from the money she got as a pension due to the disappearance of one her sons during the war, if she would like to come and live with him for some time. She was happy to accept as she loved her son.
He picked his mother up in a swanky car and took her to his home where she spent two months.During this time the woman's son, who she loved and trusted took advantage of his mother and cheated her of Rs. 150,000 that he took on two occasions from her bank account. In spite of the fact that he was an owner of a textile business and a wealthy man, he sent his mother back empty handed in a bus with just the clothes she had on her back. When she got back, she complained to the Grama Niladhari of her area about what her son had done to her, saying she he had taken the money collected by her over a period of time to be used for meritorious deeds. So much for gratitude.(By A.J. Karandagolla)

Herath to retire after first Test against England
	
Veteran left-arm spinner Rangana Herath will call it quits from the longest format of the game after the first Test against England at Galle.
Herath, who has 430 Test scalps to his name, is second on Sri Lanka's list of leading wicket-takers - behind Muttiah Muralitharan, who has 800 wickets. Among currently active bowlers, he has the third best tally - behind James Anderson [564] and Stuart Broad [433] - on the bowlers' list.
The first Test against England at Galle - starting from November 6 - will present an opportunity for him to leave even Broad behind and cap off his Test career in style at Galle.
Herath made his Test debut back in 1999 but was at the peak of his powers only after Sri Lanka's premier spinner Muttiah Muralitharan called time on his career. Of the 92 Tests Herath has played so far, 22 of them came in the period between his debut and July 2010 - the time when Muralitharan retired. Herath picked 71 of his wickets in this phase at an unflattering bowling average of 37.88.
But the numbers improved exponentially once there was a Muralitharan-shaped void in Sri Lanka's Test side. In less than eight years since the retirement, Herath has featured in 70 of the 81 Tests that Sri Lanka have played, and has picked 359 wickets at 25.98.(Cricbuz)

If govt. decisions made without UNP, it is unacceptable: SF
	
Minister Sarath Fonseka said on Sunday that it was unacceptable, if decisions with regard to government matters were taken disregarding the UNP which contributed a lot to form this government.
He said it was the UNP which had the mandate to form a government and added that it played a major role to get the President elected.
Commenting on the President?s decisions to remove the director boards of the BOC, BOI and Peoples bank, he said it was a matter of concern, if the UNP had not involved in the decision making process.
?It was reported that the order to remove the director boards had been made without the knowledge of the subject minister Lakshman Kiriella. This is a UNP led government and if the UNP had not involved in the process, it is a shortcoming,? he said.
Speaking to media at the Ape Gama after an event, he said there would not have been an issue, if the subject minister had been consulted when decisions were made.
?The institutions of which the director boards were removed come under the purview of UNP ministers. Whoever the minister, decisions should be made in consultation with the respective minister according to the provisions of the constitution,? he said. (Ajith Siriwardane)

Indian judgement on LGBT rights: Can SL follow same path?
	
Indian LGBTQ community celebrates Supreme Court verdict in favour of gay sex rights
?
With a revolutionary judgement, the Indian Supreme Court last month abolished laws that criminalized sexual activities between individuals of same-sex. The panel of judges headed by Chief Justice Dipak Misra held that criminalization of same sex relationships by Section 377 of Indian Penal Code was contrary to the Constitution of India, and that it violated fundamental rights of individuals especially the Articles 15 of Constitution which guarantees explanation that no discrimination should be done against any citizen on grounds of religion, race, caste, sex or place of birth. Arguments of public morality and public decency came up as usual, yet the court did not hesitate to strike down this archaic colonial time legal provision which was in force for a period of about 158 years in India. The court also declared that Section 377 of Indian penal code was unconstitutional ?in so far as it criminalizes consensual sexual conduct between adults of the same sex?. This landmark judgment has given a ray of hope for the LGBT community in Sri Lanka as well. However, if we could follow the same legal path is still a question due to legal and social barriers. First obstacle is the cultural attitudes which are heavily influenced by Victorian era norms (which have no relevancy to Sri Lankan traditions). The other barrier is the legal limitations. This article is mostly focussing on the latter.
The Sri Lankan Penal Code contains provisions similar to Indian Penal Code, which criminalizes sexual activities between individuals of same-sex.?The history and origins of Section 365 of Sri Lankan Penal code runs back to 16th Century, when the Buggery Act was imposed in England to prohibit ?unnatural sexual acts against the will of God?. This law further prescribed death penalty on such offenders. Following the Wolfenden report, the UK Parliament finally abolished this law in 1967, while former colonies such as India, Sri Lanka and commonwealth Caribbean continued to keep these legal provisions in their penal law, remnants of outdated British legal codes.?
Legal provisions which are often used against affairs of LGBT community often relates to decency. This implies that majority heterosexual affairs are naturally ?decent? while same-sex relationships are often regarded as ?indecent?.? In a context where the police tend to arrest even heterosexual couples at parks for indecency, it is not a surprise that they have a higher tendency to use indecency argument against LGBT relationships.
Section 365A of our Penal Code, which is also used as a legal tool against same-sex relationships, stipulates that ?any person who, in public or private, commits any act of gross indecency with another person, shall be guilty of an offence?. This section makes it illegal to commit ?act of indecency? even in private. What is considered decent and what is indecent (in private context) appears to be highly subjective. It is a question how a heterosexual activity between two consenting individuals in private sphere becomes decent, while a sexual activity between consenting adults of same-sex in private sphere becomes indecent.?
Wording of Section 365 of the Sri Lankan Penal Code (and that of Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code) contains the ambiguous term ?carnal intercourse against the order of nature? which is the vague benchmark used to differentiate and condemn sexual activities of LGBT community. This term appears to normalize heterosexual behaviour of the majority while affairs and activities of the sexual minorities are automatically treated as ?against the order of nature?. This gives rise to a fundamental question regarding the nature of human sexuality. Is it merely a biological arrangement? Should it necessarily be heterosexual? The same line of thinking entails whether sexual orientation, which is beyond the control of an individual, could be made the basis of a criminal offence. Present understanding of human sexuality is that it is a social construction, though the topic is open to debate. Even if we argue that human sexuality is biologically determined, it is clear that sexual orientation is beyond control of the relevant individual.?
?
"Both Constitutions in Sri Lanka and India impose limitations on rights of citizens on concerns of morality. But Sri Lankan constitution and Indian Constitution have a few key difference as well"
Article 12 of our constitution clearly states that no person should be discriminated on the grounds of sex, and the same Article guarantees equal protection before the law. Could a citizen be discriminated, or treated in a different manner before the law due to sexual orientation? Apparently this is what Section 365 does. However the Fundamental Rights provisions in our constitution are subject to limits imposed by Article 15 of the Constitution which stipulates that equality provisions shall be subject to restrictions in the interest of morality, among other restrictions. This has become fatal to any claim by persons with deviant sex identities, of equality before the law. Hence, there is a conflict between claims of protection from discrimination and morality. This explains us that if same sex relationships are against morality, claims of equality before the law cannot be maintained. Therefore, a judicial battle for the fundamental right of equality before the law and for decriminalizing same-sex relationships is bound to fail within the constitution itself.??
Morality was a major argument put forward against abolition of Section 377 in India.? While a crucial petition claiming to abolish Section 377 being heard before the High Court of Delhi in 2008, Additional Solicitor General P.P. Malhotra commented stating that homosexuality would lead to a big health hazard and degrade moral values of society. This represents the popular Victorian sense of morality which normalizes heterosexual affairs while depicting homosexuality as an evil degeneration.?
Both Constitutions in Sri Lanka and India impose limitations on rights of citizens on concerns of morality. But Sri Lankan constitution and Indian Constitution have a few key difference as well. One is the power of judicial review of laws. Indian Supreme Court has certain powers for judicial review of legislation; hence it has the power to demolish any law or any part thereof which is found to be conflicting with Constitutional provisions. This was the major advantage the LGBT community had, in appeals to review the laws criminalizing same-sex relationships. Article 13 of Indian Constitution states that laws which are inconsistent with the fundamental rights are void. Hence, all which was legally required was to show that penal law in India was violating the constitutional rights of individuals. However, on the other hand, Article 16 of Sri Lankan Constitution expressly states that all existing written law and unwritten laws shall be valid, notwithstanding any inconsistency with the fundamental rights chapter of the Constitution. This constitutional provision presents a legal challenge totally different from the experience of Indian legal activists.?
Sri Lankan Supreme Court has a limited window of judicial review of draft laws only at the Bill stage. Once a law is passed and approved in the Parliament, such law cannot be challenged later for its inconsistency with the Constitution. This creates the second obstacle in any legal battle for abolition of Section 365 of the Penal Code, as it is expected to be in force even if it is found inconsistent with our Constitution. In Sri Lanka, the Supreme Court is not the forum for statutory changes, and it is up to the Parliament to amend the law, through a new legislative process.?
Limitation of rights imposed on grounds of morality, and lack of powers for judicial review of laws in Sri Lanka make it unlikely that a judicial process could be used to abolish Section 356 of Penal Code, as happened in India. Sri Lankan courts are technically incapable of abolishing or changing an existing law which has already been passed by the legislature. Such changes of laws should originate from the Parliament itself. Any proposal for a change of law requires majority vote of members of Parliament, who often succumbs to views of voters who believe in popular conceptions of morality. In short, effective legislative process to amend the law is highly unlikely, while judicial process may face unavoidable constitutional limitations. Does this mean a dead end for LGBT rights?
?
"Article 12 of our constitution clearly states that no person should be discriminated on the grounds of sex, and the same Article guarantees equal protection before the law"
?
The writer has an alternative opinion on this issue. Although it appears that having a judicial relief is almost impossible due to constitutional limitations on courts in demolishing an existing law, our judiciary is entrusted with the role of interpretation of laws, and the Supreme Court holds the exclusive power to interpret the Constitution. The Constitutional limitation imposed by Article 15 on concerns of?morality? has to be interpreted in a progressive way, to avoid influence of popular misbelief on LGBT community. Court may also re-define the meanings of vague terms in legal codes such as ?indecency? ?immorality? and ?intercourse against the order of nature?. Unless the Section 365 is not repealed by a legislative intervention, this interpretative remedy could substantially solve the issues faced by the LGBT community, by getting their affairs not falling within the ambit of Section 365.?
A supportive view could be seen in the 2009Delhi High Court Judgment Naz Foundation v. Govt. of NCT of Delhi, in which case rights of LGBT community were first upheld. In the judgement the Delhi High Court pointed out that ?popular morality or public disapproval of certain acts is not a valid justification for restriction of the fundamental rights ? Popular morality, as distinct from a constitutional morality derived from constitutional values, is based on shifting and subjecting notions of right and wrong.? This argument was developed from the views of none other than Dr. B.R. Ambedkar who headed drafting of Indian Constitution. The same principles could be applied by our Supreme Court in defining ?morality? in line with the principles of equality embedded in the Constitution and especially in the fundamental rights chapter, to uphold rights of LGBT community.

Saudi official provides another version of Khashoggi death
	
?
RIYADH REUTERS Oct 21 -As Saudi Arabia faced intensifying international scepticism over its story about the death of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, a senior government official laid out a new version of the death inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul that in key respects contradicts previous explanations.? ?
?The latest account, provided by a Saudi official who requested anonymity, includes details on how the team of 15 Saudi nationals sent to confront Khashoggi on Oct. 2 had threatened him with being drugged and kidnapped and then killed him in a chokehold when he resisted. A member of the team then dressed in Khashoggi?s clothes to make it appear as if he had left the consulate.? ?
?After denying any involvement in the disappearance of Khashoggi, 59, for two weeks, Saudi Arabia on Saturday morning said he had died in a fistfight at the consulate. An hour later, another Saudi official attributed the death to a chokehold, which the senior official reiterated.? ?
?Turkish officials suspect the body of Khashoggi, a Washington Post columnist and critic of powerful Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, was cut up but the Saudi official said it was rolled up in a rug and given to a ?local cooperator? for disposal. Asked about allegations that Khashoggi had been tortured and beheaded, he said preliminary results of the investigation did not suggest that.??

SL family get residency in New Zealand after eight-year battle
	
A year after they pleaded to avoid deportation to Sri Lanka, a Sri Lankan family living in Queenstown, New Zealand, have been granted residency and are giving back to the community that supported them, New Zealand media reported.
"I am so happy," an emotional Dinesha Wijerathne said, while working in her new chef job at the community project Let's Eat.
"I just want to thank everybody."
Husband Sam Wijerathne, a taxi driver, said they had struggled for eight years to reach a point of certainty for the family.
"We came here for a better life for my kids. It has been a hard life but now the boys are doing their job - their school work and all their teachers are happy with them."
The couple and their three cricket-mad, primary school-aged boys had lived, worked and studied in New Zealand for eight years when their world fell apart last year.
As they went through the residency application process, Dinesha Wijerathne, the primary visa holder, was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis (MS) and was unable to work.
Their working visa applications were declined and the future looked grim.
However, their story touched the hearts of many people.
Queenstown Primary School was amongst the first to rally behind them. Tam Schurmann and the charity Baskets of Blessings realised the family's situation and became involved.
Local MP Hamish Walker stepped in too.
He assisted them to appeal to the Immigration and Protection Tribunal, buying time for the family, before requesting the Immigration Minister to intervene.
Walker, a first term National Party MP, lobbied Associate Minister of Immigration Kris Faafoi.
"Really I must thank him for allowing this family to stay in New Zealand," Walker said.
From the beginning Walker promised the family he would do everything he could to keep them in New Zealand, but knew the odds were against them.
"We didn't have long at the time. They were weeks away from being deported."
The incredible public support was a key factor, Walker believes.
About 450 people marched through Queenstown in a display of community unity, and hundreds of others provided food, petrol vouchers and support.
Schurmann first met the family when Dinesha Wijerathne was nominated for a gift basket through the Queenstown charity Baskets of Blessing.
"When that was delivered we realised there was a far greater need. We put the word out to the greater community - that they were unable to work and couldn't put food on the table.
"We were overwhelmed with unconditional love, from single mums dropping off half of their weekly groceries to residents from all walks of life."
The community fed the family for about eight months, she said.
"Not only has it now come full circle but Dinesha is now supporting a project that's providing for many more."
When Dinesha Wijerathne was given permission to work, MS was making it difficult for her to work fulltime as a chef in a traditional kitchen.
However, she was "snapped up" by the Presbyterian Churches of the Wakatipu as the catering manager for their already successful free Pasta Cafe and similar initiatives, Schurmann said.
The role has broadened with the introduction of the Let's Eat programme, another charity initiated by Schurmann, cooking up 400 frozen meals each week for distribution in the community, using food surpluses provided by supermarkets.
"Dinesha oversees menu design, stock take, takes care of food safety...the most difficult thing is seeing what food she has to work with in the morning and coming up with simple recipes for the volunteers to make."
The family still has a difficult road ahead. Dinesha Wijerathne's health is challenging, they have a $30,000 bill to pay to immigration lawyers and they are living in a one-bedroom room in the former Queenstown Holiday Park, but Walker believes they deserve to stay.
"They have been tax payers in New Zealand for several years and I have no doubt the three boys will go on to became great New Zealanders in whatever field they choose."
At least one, 12-year-old Subath, already knows where that will be. Expect to see him in future as a Black Cap.

SL needs further safeguards against rights violations: HRW
	
Sri Lanka?s draft counterterrorism law significantly improves upon the current, abusive Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA) but needs further safeguards against rights violations, Human Rights Watch said.
It said in a statement Parliament should amend the bill to fully comply with international human rights standards and resist pressure to roll back its reforms.
The Counter Terrorism Act of 2018, drafted to replace the PTA, narrows the definition of terrorism, increases protections against torture and coerced confessions, and reduces pretrial detention. But overbroad provisions could be used to prohibit peaceful protests and ban nongovernmental organizations. Curbs on police powers remain insufficient.
?The Sri Lankan government has finally addressed the torture-tarred Prevention of Terrorism Act, but the proposed law needs stronger human rights protections,? said Letta Tayler, senior terrorism and counterterrorism researcher at Human Rights Watch. ?Parliament should reject attempts to add abusive clauses and pass a bill that advances the rule of law.?
The Cabinet of Ministers submitted the draft law to parliament on October 9, 2018. Media reports suggest that there is pressure within parliament to reduce the bill?s rights protections. Measures reportedly under consideration would include restoring the Prevention of Terrorism Act?s use of confessions to police as evidence in court.
Sri Lanka has agreed to calls by the United Nations Human Rights Council and the European Union to repeal the current law as part of the government?s accountability and reconciliation measures for widespread abuses during the country?s 26-year civil war, which ended in 2009. Government security forces committed multiple serious human rights violations under the PTA, which the government enacted as an emergency measure in 1979 and made permanent in 1982. The government has yet to carry out most reforms pledged to the Human Rights Council in its 2015 resolution.
Parliament should bring the draft law into full compliance with international human rights standards in a transparent and participatory process, Human Rights Watch said. The law should automatically lapse after two years, with renewal to be considered after an assessment of its impact on human rights.
The Attorney General?s Office should review all PTA prosecutions that are tainted by credible evidence of torture or other abuse and provide redress for violations. It should also prosecute and hold to account all law enforcement and other government officials implicated in the abuse of terrorism suspects.
?After years of stalling, Sri Lanka finally appears poised to scrap its discredited Prevention of Terrorism Act,? Tayler said. ?The government should start demonstrating its seriousness about breaking with past abuses by strengthening its new counterterrorism bill.?

The UN's request to repatriate Kalana Amunupura, the Commander of the Sri Lankan contingent in the UN peacekeeping mission in Mali will have serious repercussions on the entire army, the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) said today
SLPP Chairman G.L. Peiris said serious allegations, such as those of shelling UN sites and hospitals in Puthukuduirippu and Puthumathalan and torturing and killing LTTE surrendees have been levelled against him merely on the words of Yasmin Sooka, a panelist in the experts panel appointed by the UN Secretary General to compile a report on Sri Lanka.
He said Ms. Sooka levelled these allegations without any evidence or inquiry.
?It will have serious repercussions not only on the 58th Division but on the entire Sri Lankan Army,? Prof. Peiris said and added that the government had again displayed its inability to handle foreign relations.
?If it were our government, we would have asked for the basis of such allegations,? he said and added that the UNHRC resolution 30/1 of October 1, 2015 committed Sri Lanka to an international tribunal comprising commonwealth and foreign judges and therefore such allegations against the military would be serious.

Undermining the rule  of law - EDITORIAL
	
On October 16, President Sirisena donated a sum of rupees one million to the family of a police sergeant Sanath Gunawardana, who went berserk at the Thebuwana police station, pointed his T-56 assault rifle at OIC of the station and stormed out onto the public road endangering the lives of the public. It took officers of the STF to disarm the enraged police officer. During the ensuing struggle, the sergeant fired his weapon which fortunately did not harm members of the public who were in the vicinity.? He was arrested and interdicted from service and was in the immediate aftermath of the presidential ?gift? reinstated by the IGP.?
On what grounds did the president decide to publicly honour this non-commissioned officer who had publicly broken every rule in the police code of conduct? What prompted the Commander-in-Chief of the three armed forces and the police force to shame officers of a service he was the head by rewarding an act which amounted to worse than insubordination, endangering public life and damaging the moral of this essential service???
What is worse was that the officer concerned has, by his own admission, had run-ins with the law on previous occasions too. He himself had admitted his role on firing on Muslim civillians at Kalutara in 1995, resulting in four civillian deaths.?
According to his account of that incident, the OIC of that station had ordered his officers to open fire on civillians. It was held in a court of law (again his admission) his claim was not accepted. So why did our Head of State decide to reward only this particular sergeant? It would appear the president has forgotten another of his pledges to the public during the presidential election campaign to let the law run its course without interference from politicians.?
It brings to mind the dark days of the President JR Jayawardene?s government when laws were twisted to accommodate his whims and fancies. An era where those who broke the law were openly feted and rewarded, as in the case of the violation of the fundamental rights of Ms. Vivienne Gunawardene by the Kollupitiya police. Ms. Goonerwardene and her husband Leslie who were senior members of the LSSP had complained of wrongful arrest and degrading treatment by the Kollupitiya Police. The court conceded wrongful arrest, but held that the degrading treatment alleged had not been proved.?
Making it clear that the law enforcement officers could act with impunity in matters protecting interests of politicians of the ruling party, JR?s government promptly promoted the guilty officer and paid the fine imposed on him. To add insult to injury, the JR government then organised protests outside the homes of the Judges who heard the case and gave verdicts detrimental to the government in power. JR Jayewardene cynically observed that Sri Lanka was a ?five star democracy? in which people have a right to protest even against Judges of the Supreme Courts. Sri Lanka does not need that type of ?Five Star Democracy?.
Those who voted both the president and the present parliament into power voted for a change from the authoritarianism of the immediate past regime. They voted for a clean administration. They voted against the presidential form of government. People voted against the politicization of the armed services and the police force. They voted for a government which promised to bring down the cost-of-living and an end to authoritarianism.?
Sadly the regime of President Sirisena and his Prime Minister have not been able to deliver on the promises they gave the electorate. The promised clean administration has been castigated into the dustbins of history with the government being embroiled in the massive bond scam. The promised new Constitution is nothing but a distant dream... If at all.?
Despite bringing down the cost-of-living during its initial year in office, today the cost-of-living has rocketed way beyond the means of not only the working class, but the middle class as well. A positive step has been the implementation of the Right-to-Information Act a legacy of the government.?
The President?s recent attempt to sack the Boards of Directors of Bank of Ceylon, People?s Bank, the Board of Investment and claims of Indian involvement in attempts to assassinate him read like a chapter out of ?Alice in Wonderland?

UNP of Dudley, DS no more: President
	
President Maithripala Sirisena today said he, as the common candidate in November 2014, assumed he was allaying with the UNP founded by the late D.S.-Dudley Senanayakes but later on realised that he had not allied with such a UNP.
President Sirisena said this during a ceremony held at the BMICH to commemorate four Senanayakes namely D S, Dudley, R G and FR who had played great roles in securing independence.
?The late D. S. Senanayake, did not engage in corruption, did not waste public funds. He was patriotic and adopted home grown agricultural policies. This is why the UNP became a great party. The UNP was built upon the visions of these great men. I hope the UNP would find greatness again and become the real party which was founded by these leaders,? he said.
He recalled that there were two dansalas in Polonnaruwa for Poson for many years.
?One was named Bandaranaike Dansala and the other Senanayake Dansala. Bandaranaike Dansala was organized by the SLFPers and Senanayake Dansala was organized by the UNPers. However UNPers could not organize it since 2007. Then I decided to rename the Dansala organized by the SLFPers as Bandaranaike and Senanayake Dansala since I thought we should be grateful to these great UNP leaders,? he added.
While stating that his father was among those who were settled by the late D. S Senanayake, the President stated that he was a mixture of Senanayakes and Bandaranaikes.
Joint Opposition MP Vasudeva Nanayakkara said time had come once again to launch a struggle against imperialists just as late F. R Senanayake did as US led imperialism had come up again today with the leadership of Donald Trump. ?USA is trying to rule all countries in the world,? he said.
Former Minister Imitiyaz Bakeer Markar who revived memories on late Prime Minister Dudley Senanayake said the late leader always stressed that the issues faced by the Tamils in the North and the East and issues of estate communities were two things which has to be resolved going beyond party politics. He said the late Mr. Senanayake said this in Parliament when a motion was brought to abolish the Tamil Language Act.
Western Province Governor Hemakumara Nanayakkara who paid tribute to the late R G Senanayake said he was a true Buddhist who always held that true Buddhists should respect all religious and ethnic groups. ? Late R G Senanayake always strived to look after the interests of all people while trying to win real freedom for the country,? he said. (Yohan Perera)

US to leave nuclear treaty with Russia
	
?
President Donald Trump said on Saturday the United States will exit the Cold-War era Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty that eliminated a class of nuclear weapons, in a move that is likely to upset Russia.? ?
?The INF treaty, negotiated by then-President Ronald Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev and ratified by the U.S. Senate in 1988, required elimination of short-range and intermediate-range nuclear and conventional missiles by both countries.? ?
??Russia has not, unfortunately, honored the agreement so we?re going to terminate the agreement and we?re going to pull out,? Trump told reporters after a rally in Nevada.? ?
?Washington believes Moscow is developing and has deployed a ground-launched system in breach of the INF treaty that could allow Moscow to launch a nuclear strike on Europe at short notice. Russia has consistently denied any such violation.? ?
?Trump said the United States will develop the weapons unless Russia and China agree to a halt on development.? ?
?China is not a party to the treaty and has invested heavily in conventional missiles as part of an anti-access/area denial strategy, while the INF has banned U.S possession of ground- launched ballistic missiles or cruise missiles of ranges between 500 and 5,500 km (311 and 3,418 miles).?
?
?Trump?s national security adviser, John Bolton, will visit Moscow next week.?

Welgama?s remarks detrimental to JO: Gammanpila
	
The recent remarks made by UPFA MP Kumara Welgama on his objection to Gotabaya Rajapaksa, were baseless and detrimental to smooth functioning of the Joint Opposition, the Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) leader MP Udaya Gammanpila said today.
MP Welgama recently made remarks that he was firmly against Gotabaya Rajapaksa becoming the Head of State, adding that since he was holding the US citizenship, it was impossible for him to contest the upcoming Presidential Election.
Addressing a news briefing, Gammanpila said MP Welgama had been advised not to make such remarks on numerous occasions, especially at the party leaders meeting, which was held recently.
?We didn?t know he would act in this manner because he worked towards the upliftment of the party. However, if he continued to make such remarks, we have to forget what he had done to the party and take action,? he said. (Sheain Fernandopulle)

Yameen?s defeat in Maldives election upheld by SC
	
?
THE HINDU, 21st OCTOBER, 2018-The Maldives? top court on Sunday ended weeks of uncertainty by rejecting President Abdulla Yameen?s controversial bid to annul last month?s election results, upholding his landslide defeat to an opposition candidate.
The five-judge Supreme Court bench unanimously ruled that Mr. Yameen had failed to prove his claim that the election was rigged and a fresh poll was necessary in the Indian Ocean archipelago.
Under international pressure, Mr. Yameen initially conceded defeat after Ibrahim Mohamed Solih emerged the winner in the September 23 poll.
But the strongman ruler then filed an appeal this month, throwing the island nation into turmoil and attracting warnings from the United States and regional superpower India to respect the outcome.
Opposition activists celebrated outside the Supreme Court in the capital Male after the decision was read out, effectively drawing a line under Mr Yameen?s five years of iron-fisted rule.
Opposition legislator Mariya Didi said Mr. Yameen ? who lobbied the Supreme Court in 2013 to nullify election results in his favour ? should now allow a smooth transition of power.
?We are pleased that the court ruled unanimously to uphold the will of the people,? Didi said on Twitter.?
?The case was based on conjecture and conspiracy theories.?
