World Ovarian Cancer Day - May 8, 2018

Ovarian cancer is the fourth highest cancer present in females in Sri Lanka
Moving away from natural food habits a likely cause

There is no early detection test and symptoms are often confused with other illnesses

On May 8 each year, the world comes together to raise awareness about Ovarian Cancer and to raise voices in solidarity in a global battle against the deadly disease. Spearheaded by the World Ovarian Cancer Coalition, the first World Ovarian Cancer Day was observed in 2013. According to the Ovarian Cancer Coalition, more than 230,000 women around the world are diagnosed each year with Ovarian Cancer. Almost 150,000 women fighting this illness succumb to it while the numbers show no signs of decreasing.
The word cancer is inherently alarming to most of us. But what is even more alarming is when symptoms are often unnoticed or mistaken. According to medical experts ovarian cancer symptoms are frequently and mistakenly attributed to other causes and illnesses.
Globally it is the third most common form of cancer among females. Consultant Gynaecologist and Cancer Surgeon at the National Cancer Institute, Maharagama, Dr. Sarada Kannangara speaking to the Health Capsule said that Ovarian Cancer is the fourth highest cancer present in females in Sri Lanka, next to breast cancer, cervical cancer and thyroid cancer.
Ovarian Cancer is a disease which can be present in older women usually in their fifties, Dr. Kannangara explained. However it does not mean that younger women are not at risk. The recent trend is for the disease to become present in more and more younger women. We have observed that these are caused mainly due to adverse food habits and consumption of food which contain artificial ingredients and chemicals, Dr. Kannangara cautioned. Moving away from the natural food habits could lead to the increase of unhealthy lifestyles resulting in such cancers.
The latest available statistics from 2010 reveal that there are around 800 new cases per annum in Sri Lanka, he said. 
According to Dr. Kannangara, women with a history of ovarian cancer in their families have a risk of developing the disease. If a certain females mother, sister, grandmother or an aunt has or had ovarian cancer such women have a tendency of developing the disease, he said. 

How can Ovarian Cancer be detected
Despite medical marvels of the recent years, global statistics reveal that Ovarian Cancer has one of the lowest survival rates of all female cancers. It also reveals that most women are diagnosed once the cancer has already spread, making treatment complicated. The delays in diagnosing Ovarian Cancer are because there is no early detection test, and symptoms are often confused with symptoms associated with other lesssevere illnesses.
At present there is no way to detect Ovarian Cancer early. However there have been two trials conducted in the United Kingdom. The first is to do regular testing and scans and the second is to do a blood test called the CA125 blood test, he said adding that both methods however have not given solid, positive indications . There is no indication that doing such routine tests can determine the presence of Ovarian Cancers. Nevertheless if there is a suspicion we always follow through to determine the presence of cysts, said the doctor.
Ovarian cysts are fluid-filled sacs or pockets in the ovary. They are common and usually form during ovulation or when the ovary releases an egg each month. These cysts are often harmless and many women with ovarian cysts dont have symptoms. But some ovarian cysts are malignant, or cancerous.  Dr. Kannangara said that the symptoms of ovarian cancer are subtle. There may be changes in the central gastrointestinal system, he said. Symptoms such as bloating, belching, difficulty in eating and even a slight alteration of bowel habits are the most commonly associated symptoms with Ovarian Cancer.
It should be noted that a woman in her fifties will usually have a bit of distension. Abdominal distention is caused by a build-up of fluids or gas in the abdominal section of the body. Although it may be a very good clue to suggest the presence of a malady, it may not necessarily be due to the formation of Ovarian Cancers, he said. 
The presence of Ovarian cysts result in the same symptoms associated with gastrointestinal problems. When there is an ovarian cyst, a woman may usually suffer from slight pain in her right or left lower abdomen. Once again it must be noted, that these are very common symptoms in women of this particular age group, so it is rather difficult to identify the illness, Dr. Kannangara explained. 

Proper diagnosis 
It is advisable to seek medical attention and do a scan if there is persistent pain and symptoms lasting for two or three months. Fortunately quite a number of people often undergo scans which make detection easier if there is a problem. Even if a scan is performed for any other ailment and cysts are discovered in the process, such women should immediately seek treatment, he added. Misdiagnosis is common, with women presenting with symptoms of Ovarian Cancer to initially receive a diagnosis related to other illnesses, according to Dr. Kannangara.
A common mistake is to misidentify general gynaecology with gynaecological-oncology, he warned. Gynecologic oncology is a specialised field of medicine that focuses on cancers of the female reproductive system, including ovarian cancer. It is imperative that a woman if suspected to have such symptoms seeks treatment from the right specialist. Not all ovarian
cysts are cancerous.
These need different treatment compared to cancerous cysts, he said. However the failure to diagnose cancerous cysts properly can result in a woman being subject to unnecessary medical procedures such as the removal of the womb, when the illness needs
attention elsewhere. 
If you have a suspicion of cancer, it is important that you seek medical advice from the correct specialisation. The diagnosis and treatment of ovarian cancer is entirely a clinical decision,
he said.  It is important to be aware of symptoms, risk factors and your family history, according to experts. Statistics reveal that when ovarian cancer is detected at an early stage -- when the cancer remains confined to the ovary -- up to 90% of women are likely to survive for more than five years. A woman who has symptoms suggestive of ovarian cancer should be referred directly to a specialist to obtain an accurate diagnosis.

And the last laugh is with him
	
When icons die, there is hysteria and there is adulation. To the same degree, there is also censure. After Rukmani Devis death, for instance, that wave of hysteria did not preclude critics like Regi Siriwardena on passing judgment. Regi identified, correctly I believe, that Rukmanis overwhelming tragedy was the fact that her legacy was sealed by her reputation as a songstress of musical numbers which were not only third rate, but also second hand. While this would not have been palatable to her fans (and there were many of them, including my grandparents, who wept the day she died), it was the harsh truth. We saw the same kind of praise and censure greeting the deaths of Khemadasa (whose forays into opera were criticised as being elitist) and, closer to the Sinhala Buddhist homeland, Amaradeva (whose forays into the raghadari sampradaya and sarala geeya were assessed rather critically as well by various writers). Now that Lester James Peries has passed away, I thought it was an apt time to understand how icons, particularly from our cultural sphere, can divide opinion and sustain confusions when they pass away.
Lester James Peries

Days after Lesters death, I happened to come across an article written by the inimitable Nalin de Silva, arguing, from what I could make of it, that the man effectively aborted the (at the outset Sinhala Buddhist) project of fusing tradition and modernity together, instead displacing tradition by a modernist cultural renaissance which depended for its enduring popularity the diffusion of certain Western paradigms. This is the kind of argument that was brought against Amaradeva and Sarachchandra, and also by de Silva. What NdeS (as I shall abbreviate him from here on wards) lays down is that the likes of Sarachchandra, Siri Gunasinghe and Lester James Peries brought about a cultural sphere which portrayed a false picture of our culture to our own people. This explains his preference for Piyadasa Sirisena over Martin Wickramasinghe. 
Criticism against Lester James Peries isnt the preserve of the Jathika Chinthanaya (JC) only, in fact no less a figure than Gunadasa Amarasekara in a review written in the eighties praised Lesters adaptation of Kaliyugaya, which to me is one of Wickramasinghes novels which explicitly dwells on the kind of conflict between modernism and tradition that the JC is preoccupied with. Such disparate figures as Regi Siriwardena, Dr W. Dahanayake, H. L. D. Mahindapala, and Jayawilal Wilegoda did lambast him over certain works which were felt to be weakly plotted or structured, even if the criteria of values these writers based their criticisms on themselves didnt hold much water. But NdeS arguments against Lester are more philosophical than critical; they depend on the rhetoric of nationalism, not the rabble-rousing sort, but the virulently indigenous and majoritarian sort.
Praise and censure
The truth is that Lester was perhaps the only director from here who has attracted praise and censure, sometimes by the same writers, from every corner of our critical fraternity: the Marxists, the feminists, and of course, the Sinhala Buddhist intellectuals from the JC. 
Heres an extract from NdeSs piece:

The allegation, of course, is that even though Lester imitated and in some ways mastered the sort of cultural modernity which was dependent on Westernisation, and that through the cinema, he was unable (as were Martin Wickramasinghe and other artistes, thinkers, and scientists) to transcend his own identity and win over the country. In other words, he was a modernist, but without the anchorage to his country that was needed if he was to transcend the limits of his roots and become an artistes of his nation. I leave the contentious debate this necessitates for a later week, since Im quite unaware of the dynamics that go into the making and resolution of such debates, but for the moment I am concerned with NdeSs central claim: that the lack of Sinhala-ness in Lesters movies proves the cultural experiment in 1956 did not bring popular audiences to the purveyors of that experiment. Piyadasa Sirisena, long before Martin Wickramasinghe, could do that. So could Sirisena Wimalaweera, the playwright and the filmmaker. But not Lester and Amaradeva. 
Opinion of Sinhala journalists
The fact is that while NdeS was making this claim from one side of the political spectrum (which applies, by the way, to the cultural, just as it does to the political), from the other side another intellectual was making the opposite claim. Consider the following: 
Many Sinhala journalists have praised and even said that the late Dr Lester James Peries [is] the greatest cinema maker in Sri Lanka, and surely one of the best in the world... I stand to disagree with those claims. Lester was a great cine narrator no doubt. Yet his cinema use was essentially an urban middle class anxiety that soothed the postcolonial Sinhala nationalist insecurity. Like Pundit Amaradeva, Lester never could be considered as a transformative social artist who provided a trajectory for a deconstructive social mobility. But [he] rather reconfirmed the hegemony of the state-centric (in fact Sinhala urban) ideology in almost all his work. My complaint is not because he made something like Rekava but [because] he refused to move from that neo-colonial Sarala Rekava.
The allegation, of course, is that even though Lester imitated and in some ways mastered the sort of cultural modernity which was dependent on Westernisation, and that through the cinema, he was unable to transcend his own identity and win over the country
Heres the deal; when NdeS and the so-called intellectual protectionists of the JC claim that Amaradeva and Lester et al were not Sinhalese and Buddhist enough to transcend their universality, the likes of the writer of this comment, posted on Facebook hours after Lesters death, contend that far from being uprooted from that Sinhalese Buddhist culture, these artists actually strengthened the worldview of that particular milieu, and in doing so strengthened the cultural and political hegemony present therein at the cost of the Other.
Now which side are we to believe The side that says the revolutionists were renegades, or the side that says the renegades were revolutionists Did Lester and Amaradeva go back on their mission to bring Sri Lanka together through the arts, or were they removed from the heartbeat of the people, I for one cant tell, but in the philosophical conundrum this compels, I can sense irony and some humour too. And in the end, I suppose that has a lot to do with how we view things; the problem at the heart of the leading preachers of the JC has been their inability to bridge their praise for cultural relativism over their inability to view the world through the prism of that kind of relativism. They hold certain facts sacred, objective, and when they talk about the world in those terms, they believe that the world cannot be talked about in any other terms. How else would someone like Lester, Amaradeva and Wickramasinghe, who had their faults and flaws, be at the receiving end of their vitriol the moment the critics of the JC allege that these artists perpetuated the political and cultural hegemonies which were propped up and supported by the JC 
Perhaps its time we took a breather and looked back. Somewhere out there, Peries and the revolutionists of 1956 are laughing. At us. And at those who are muddling up their notions of hegemonies and traditions in a bid to lambast those artists.

Ayurvedic tips for a healthy you
	

The human body is a complicated machine. Even a machine has to be maintained to ensure longer existence. Being healthy is the ultimate gift one can enjoy throughout life. There are many tricks and tips to keep your body healthy, says Ayurvedic Doctor D.D.A Hettiarachchi of Ganemulla.

Common illnesses 
Cough, colds, fever, headaches and day to day physical pains are common ailments we have to battle against. Boil 20 grams of dried ginger and 40 grams of coriander together in a bowl after adding eight cups of water. Boil until the water reduces to one cup. Drink half a cup of this miraculous mixture adding some sugar or a few drops of honey. Serious illnesses and many day to day pains can be healed completely by having this herbal drink. This simple medicine is powerful enough to control high fever without any side effects. This medicine is better than common pain killers. Have this medicinal drink regularly. Make it a habit to drink this even when one is in good health. This herbal drink strengthens the immune system as well as offers protection to guard against diseases. 
Phlegm 
This thick substance secreted by the Mucous Membrane of the respiratory passages is inviting diseases. It is always good to keep an eye on the level of phlegm in your body and keep it under control. Do not take medicine just to dry it up. Phlegm needs to be removed from your body from time to time. When you get a cold, let the phlegm to leave your system. Most people dont know that phlegm is a root cause for many diseases. 
Digestion and sleep
Dont sleep after meals. Let your body perform its duty of digestion once you have a meal. Sit for around 20 minutes after a main meal and have walk later. Make sure to have dinner at least two hours before bed time. Under no circumstance should you sleep on your right. Sleep on your left side. 
Healthy Skin
Apply a fine powder made of Sandalwood and Kokumagara and wait for some time before bathing. You can make this fine powder by rubbing a piece of sandalwood and Kokumagara on a stone. Add a few drops of water when making this mixture. A bathing stone or one thats found in streams can be used for this purpose. This natural treatment protects the skin and seals natural oils in it in addition to controlling the process of sweating. This mixture is very effective in controlling the process of sweating. This method used by many generations to keep the skin healthy and glowing is better compared to the use of unknown chemicals applied at salons. 
Drink some clean water as the first thing you do upon waking up. Drink as much as possible. This will cleanse your interior  the hormones, chemicals and toxins that have built up in body during the night. Water helps to flush them away. 
Do not eat so that the food overloads your stomach. Balance the amount of food you take with the volume of water you usually have after a meal. Always keep room for food and water to be mixed in your stomach. Remember that your stomach expands after a meal. 
Avoid junk. Never take much oily, deep fried, highly salted and greasy food nor artificial drinks. Always have natural food. Eat leafy greens, fruits and vegetables, but remember to avoid highly toxic apples, oranges and grapes which are injected with chemicals for a longer shelf-life. 
Drink warm water if you are developing symptoms of a cold. Having warm water aids blood circulation and gives your body the strength to fight against invading germs. Have lukewarm water after a meal because it eases digestion. Do not drink cold water as it shrinks your stomach making digestion difficult. 
Never throw away coconut water. Drink it instead.

Balarishta Yogas causing the death of newborns
	

By A.S. Fernando
There is no greater asset to us than our children. They are our greatest source of joy, comfort and happiness. The love of a parent for his/her offspring is boundless. We work and live for our children and in fact, it is the children who make our life worth living.
As soon as a child is born, the father would rush to an astrologer seeking to know what the future holds in store for it.
The first thing that an astrologer looks for in an Natal Chart of a newborn is the Ayurdaya factor  whether the newborn is destined to live long or is afflicted by a Balarishta or death during childhood. Balarishta in Astrological parlance means planetary combinations causing the death of a child before it is eight years of age.
Celebrated Indian astrologer Varahamihara has discussed in detail in Chapter VI of his great classical work Brihat Jataka the important rules relating to Balarishta.

Let us examine the vital rules referred to in Varahamihiras Brihat Jataka.

A child born during Sandhi in Chandra Hora and when malefics are posited in the Navamsa of any of the signs is subject to Balarishta. Sandhi refers to a period of 48 minutes before sunrise and after sunset. Uncertain is the life span of a child born in Chandra Hora for the simple reason that the Moon by nature is uncertain and unsteady as she is waxing or waning all the time.
	If the birth takes place when all malefics occupying the first half of the Zodiac (10th House to the 4th) and benefics occupy the second half of the Zodiac and if either Cancer or Scorpio is the Ascendant sign or if the Lagna and the 7th House are hemmed in between malefics, the child would die.
	The death of the newborn would occur soon if malefics occupy the Lagna and the 7th and malefics conjoin the Moon which does not receive the aspect of benefics.
	The child would die soon if a weak Moon occupies the 12th when there are no benefics in quadrants and malefics occupy the Lagna and the 8th.
	Moon in the 6th or the 8th aspected by malefics would result in early death. The child also would die when the Lagna lord occupying the 7th is defeated by a malefic in a Graha Yuddha (planetary war).
	The child would die soon if it is born when the Moon is in the Lagna,4th, 7th, 8th or the 10th with malefics and if Moon is hemmed in between malefics in the 4th, 7th, or the 8th. However, if the Moon is in the Lagna while malefics occupy the 7th or the 8th without the aspect of benefics, mother would die with the child.
	A child would die soon if born when the Moon is in the last Navamsa of a sign while there are malefics in the 5th and the 9th without beneficial aspects.
	The newborn would die early if Moon is in the Lagna while there are malefics in the 7th. However, if the Moon conjunct with a malefic in the Lagna is in eclipse and Mars is in the 8th, both mother and child would die soon.
	Child would die soon if Sun or Moon occupies the Lagna with malefics in trines and the 8th without the aspect of or association with benefics.
	Saturn in the 12th, Sun in the 9th, Moon in Lagna and Mars in the 8th without the aspect of Jupiter would result in the death of the child.
	If the Moon sans the beneficial aspects, conjoins a malefic in the 1st, 5th, 7th, 8th, 9th, or the 12th the new born would die early.
	If the Moon in Gochara (in transit) enters the House of the most powerful malefic planet in the horoscope, or Jamma Rashi or Jamma Lagna while being subject to malefic aspects, the newborn would die early.

Curtains for thief Gang
	
Who robbed celebritys home
The police had then examined CCTV footage near the residence of Dr. Peries and identified a suspicious three wheeler
With the arrest of the five suspects over the theft of the Ranamayura lifetime achievement medal of filmmaker the late Dr. Lester James Peries, a more expansive and a rooted organised crime of ransacking funerals of popular personnel was revealed by the Police. 
This suggests that the medal of Dr. Peries that went missing was one of many such stolen valuables from funerals by a gang. The group consists of men aged between 46 to 64 that pick and chose well-attended funerals of popular personalities such as artistes or other public figures and then systematically rob valuable items such as phones. Their victims could be the sympathizing visitors, family members of the deceased or even the deceased itself.

These facts came to light when the Ranamayura medal went missing on May 2 (Wednesday) morning while Dr. Peries funeral service was still in progress. After much publicity was given by the media to this theft, the missing medal was found on an overhead rack of a private bus plying on the Kollupitiya-Kaduwela route on Saturday. 
Police Spokesman SP Ruwan Gunasekara said at a press briefing that the arrested suspect is a member of a group of thieves who had been engaging in thefts at crowded events and VIPs funeral in Colombo and its suburb.

He said five suspects were arrested over the theft of the medal while another suspect who was an owner of a mobile phone shop was arrested on charges of possessing stolen mobile phones. 
The Bambalapitiya police launched the investigation into the incident after a relative of the late filmmaker had complained to the police over the phone stating that the lifetime achievement medal had been stolen. 
The police had then visited the residence of the late Dr. Periess on Wednesday evening. The law enforcement officers had also received a complaint from another relative stating that her apple i-phone worth Rs. 100,000, which was kept on the cabinet, was also stolen along with the medal. 
The police had then visited the residence of the late Dr. Periess on Wednesday evening. The law enforcement officers had also received a complaint from another relative stating that her apple i-phone worth Rs. 100,000, which was kept on the cabinet, was also stolen along with the medal
Video footage 
Police examined the video footage obtained from electronic media institutions and they were able to learn that the mobile phone was being stolen by someone at around 11.00 am on the day of the funeral but could not trace the identity of the suspect because the face was not recorded.

The police had then examined CCTV footage near the residence of Dr. Peries and identified a suspicious three wheeler with three persons aboard who had later attended the funeral. 
When the investigation into the three wheeler was conducted, the Bambalapitiya and Kollupitiya Police stations received an anonymous telephone call on Saturday morning stating that the medal was on the NC- 2752 private bus on the Kaduwela-Kollupitiya route. 
Two police teams were deployed in Kollupitiya and Green Path areas to intercept the bus following the information that was received. The driver and the conductor of the bus had handed over the medal to the police personnel who boarded the bus from Green Path. 
The driver and conductor said in their statements to the police that they were on their way to the police to handover the medal after they found it inside the bus on Saturday evening. 



Anonymous call
They told the police that they had recovered a parcel after a passenger informed them. According to one of the statements, the driver had also received an anonymous call where the caller had requested that the recovered parcel be handed over to the police. 
The Bambalapitiya Police had then commenced an investigation to apprehend the suspects in connection with the theft. They were unable to trace the mobile phone number because all the mobile service providers had closed shop for the long weekend. 
On Saturday evening, the police commenced an investigation to find details of the suspicious three wheeler. They were able to identify that its registered owner was a woman and resided in Kiriwaththuduwa. 
The woman informed the police that her father was using the three wheeler and he was residing at Kothalawala in Kaduwela. The Police then visited her fathers residence and identified him as one of the men who appear on the CCTV footage obtained from one of the houses near Dr. Peries residence. The police arrested the 61-year-old suspect, Percy Chandrasiri Alwis along with the three wheeler. 
Police arrested the owner of the shop on charges of possessing stolen mobile phones. The police recovered eight other similar mobile phones from the shop

The Police arrested another three suspects after questioning the first suspect. The three suspects were arrested near Kaduwela area when they were travelling in a three wheeler from Gampola and heading towards Colombo. 
The three arrested suspects, 64-year-old Nawaratna Banda alias Ralahami, 60-year-old Ananda Rohana and 46-year-old Nawasiyam were identified as residents of Gampola and Navalapitiya. 
The fifth suspect, 47-year-old Suduhakuru Sisira Kumara, was arrested on Sunday near the Sugathadasa Stadium where a UNP May Day rally was in progress. 
Police said that three of the five suspects had travelled in the seized three wheeler while the other two had travelled in a bus to steal the medal and the mobile phone from the filmmaker Dr. Lesters residence. 
Police recovered the apple mobile phone from a mobile phone shop at Nawalapitiya after it had been sold at a price of Rs.4,000. 
Police arrested the owner of the shop on charges of possessing stolen mobile phones. The police recovered eight other similar mobile phones from the shop. 
SP Gunasekara said the gang of thieves had been selling stolen mobile phones to the shop owner. 
The police spokesman said that they would inform the Attorney General about the suspects and request them to be charged in High Court. He said strict legal actions would be taken against the suspects. 
They were produced in Hulftsdorp Magistratess Court for an identification parade and were remanded till May 21.

Dont say hello to  the sun  these days!
	
Our historical records indicate 400C as the highest recorded temperature in Sri Lanka
Last year the maximum and highest recorded temperature was close to 38.60C.
the wind pattern and the ocean currents strive to create an energy balance resulting in the changing weather conditions
rain is often another output of the energy balance created by nature

With the weather becoming uncomfortable and hot during day time and cool during the evening hours, it is challenging to decipher the accuracy of a seemingly unpredictable weather. In a candid interview withDailymirror , Director of Forecasting of the Department of Meteorology, Anusha Warnasuriya explained the intricacies of the weather pattern currently experienced in the country while Consultant Physician at the Colombo South Teaching Hospital and the President of the Sri Lanka Geriatric Association Dr. Dilhar Samaraweera advised citizens on how to be safeguarded against the risk of suffering a heatstroke when the temperature rises. 

Prevalence of hot weather
Stating that the current hot weather prevailing in the country especially during the day time is by no means a heat wave, but a warm weather condition, Warnasuriya clarified that a heat wave is the prevalence of hot weather for two or three consecutive days, where an increase of 50C - 60C above the average temperature is recorded. She further noted that there are varied definitions available to explain a heatwave. At present the temperature is a little bit warmer. This is because normally March, April and May are warm during the year. The main reason for the prevailing warm weather is the absence of significant wind speed over the country. The second reason is the high humidity level in the country. Since this is the inter monsoon period, the weather condition during morning hours tends to be very sunny and the sun rays are received by the earth thereby creating a warm weather condition. These three factors contribute to the warm weather condition currently experienced in the country she said. 
The main reason leading to this discomfort and the feeling of warmth is perspiration. The sweat we perspire has no means of evaporating due to the lack of wind and the saturated humidity in the surrounding environment

It should be noted that this warm condition is by no means the maximum temperature. We have prepared a heat index using the maximum temperature and humidity level. This is sometimes recorded as 500C or 400C, which people tend to falsely take into account as the maximum temperature. However, this is not the maximum ambient temperature, but is only an index. This index is actually indicative of what we feel; in the present case it is a little bit uncomfortable and warm. The main reason leading to this discomfort and the feeling of warmth is perspiration. The sweat we perspire has no means of evaporating due to the lack of wind and the saturated humidity in the surrounding environment, Warnasuriya said. 
Elucidating that Sri Lanka is a small country surrounded by a vast oceanic area, Warnasuriya said that the islanders dont experience very high temperatures. Our historical records indicate 400C as the highest recorded temperature in Sri Lanka, which was a few decades ago. Last year the maximum and highest recorded temperature was close to 38.60C. So far we have recorded a maximum temperature of 360C for this year. The effect of the heat is less in Sri Lanka compared to India. This is because India has a much bigger land mass thus attracting more heat through the rays of the sun. Generally, when there is an upper level of wind or if there is any mechanism to get the wind flow upward, the heat condition might cease. But in India, there is a high pressure cell resulting in trapping this air mass. This is one reason for the very warm condition experienced in India at present. However, this is not the case in Sri Lanka she added. According to Warnasuriya during this time of the year, the seasonal high pressure cell is over India and not over Sri Lanka. Compared to India and Pakistan, Sri Lanka is not much in danger of being exposed to the threat of a heat wave because it is a small landscape surrounded by an ocean with a considerable wind flow. 
The Department of Meteorology with the assistance of the Ministry of Health, issued a recent bulletin on precautionary measures to be taken during the warm weather. Instructions were given to increase the intake of liquids while avoiding exposure to hot sun as much as possible
Nevertheless, the Director warned people to take precautions against the warm temperature experienced in several parts of the country since it may adversely affect the health of people, especially young children, infants and the elderly including individuals who are working outdoors and exposed to the sun for long hours. The Department of Meteorology with the assistance of the Ministry of Health, issued a recent bulletin on precautionary measures to be taken during the warm weather. Instructions were given to increase the intake of liquids while avoiding exposure to hot sun as much as possible. 
If the patient is suffering from heat and exhaustion, immediate measures should be taken to cool himself either by pouring water on the body or if possible, it is much better to immerse himself in water

Unpredictable weather

Explaining the reason behind the unpredictable weather pattern where showers may occur in several places whilst it is bright and sunny in other parts of the land, Director Warnasuriya briefed that this is a result of nature attempting to strike an energy balance in the environment. The energy balance is facilitated by the wind patterns and the ocean currents. Hence, the wind pattern and the ocean currents strive to create an energy balance resulting in the changing weather conditions experienced across the country. If this energy is not balanced, our equatorial ocean temperature would be around 1000C she said. 

This year, the average date for the South - West Monsoon is May 26 in Sri Lanka. There should be at least a pressure gradient of 2.5 across Sri Lanka with rains in Colombo, Galle and Ratnapura for at least three consecutive days, in order to declare it as the commencement of the South - West Monsoon. It is expected that the south -west monsoon would arrive in Kerala in India on June 1. However, it has been reported that they expect the rain a little earlier than on June 1. Therefore, we also expect that the South -West Monsoon might start a little earlier in Sri Lanka (particularly between May 20- 28). The onset of the monsoon is a very critical period for Sri Lanka especially between the last week of May and the first week of June. After the critical period concludes, we can expect rain settling in as a spell of showers in the country Warnasuriya concluded. 


According to Warnasuriya, in April and August the sun will be overhead twice per year. But people are more familiar with relating to this phenomenon during the April season and not during August. This is mainly because we have a very good wind pattern flow during August compared to April. On the other hand, it must be noted that rain is often another output of the energy balance created by nature. These are the reasons why it is sometimes difficult to predict the weather very accurately and this is why we have a weather forecast instead Warnasuriya explained. 
Heatstroke and what you need to know
Speaking to Daily Mirror, Dr. Samaraweera explained that heatstroke is a condition in which the body temperature could rise above 1040F / 400C or higher leading to the loss of function or loss of consciousness eventually. Explaining that a heatstroke is often followed by sever dehydration, Dr. Samaraweera said that the patient would fail to maintain the normal body temperature under such conditions. He further explained that the human body has a mechanism of producing much sweat and evaporating it to maintain the normal body temperature. However, when a person is dehydrated, his or her ability to sweat will entirely stop thus increasing the patients body temperature. This will result in the condition known as Cutaneous Vasodilation where the body will try to maintain the temperature by diverting the blood to the skin. This helps in reducing body heat. The blood vessels will dilate in the skin causing sweat, thereby lowering the body temperature and bringing it to the normal rate. This process will try to maintain a constant blood supply to the skin albeit under such circumstances the blood supply to the brain will be compromised. Hence, when this happens, one may have alteration of the level of consciousness or may experience total loss of consciousness and even result in death. This is heat stroke explained in a nutshell, Dr. Samarwaeera said. 
According to the doctor, symptoms of a heatstroke may include a low rate of sweating accompanied by muscle cramps, weakness of muscles, exhaustion and a very red and bright coloured skin tone. Increased heart rate accompanied with rapid and shallow breathing, feeling faint, vertigo and headache are among the other symptoms of a heatstroke. This will eventually be followed by the loss or alteration of consciousness. 
When a patient experiences any of the symptoms related to a heatstroke, it is vital that the patient should immediately rest and seek a place that offers shade. If the patient is suffering from heat and exhaustion, immediate measures should be taken to cool himself either by pouring water on the body or if possible, it is much better to immerse himself in water, in order to bring down the temperature. Sponging or cold compressing the body using cold water and fanning is also advisable Dr. Samaraweera said. 
Oral Rehydration Solution (ORS) is ideal to be administered to a patient affected by a heatstroke since it also contains salt. Also, king coconut which is the closest replica to saline is a much better natural solution that could be provided to a patient suffering from heat stroke he said. 
Elucidating further on the preventive measures that could be employed against the risk of a heatstroke, Dr. Samaraweera advised not to leave anyone and especially children locked inside a vehicle parked under the sun since the temperature inside a parked vehicle left under hot sun could rise by 200 F or more than 6.70C within ten minutes. He also advised that in average, people need to consume at least eight glasses of water or liquid intake for a day which is the equivalent of approximately two litres. In the case of extreme hot weather conditions, the intake of water or liquids can be increased up to twelve glasses. Advising against the exposure to sunlight between 11.00 a.m. and 3.00 p.m. when the heat would be extreme, Dr. Samaraweera cautioned against engaging in strenuous activities when the temperature is high since it could result in exhaustion. The doctor further advised to wear light and comfort clothing instead of opting for bulky and dark clothes as a preventive measures against heatstroke. Wearing sunscreen and ensuring the facilitation of proper ventilation in buildings for those living indoors were also recommended by Dr. Samaraweera during the hot weather.

Frontiers of Contemporary Management
	
Frontiers of Contemporary Management is a book by Dr.Don Ajith Colonne and focuses on facing managerial challenges in the dynamic global context. This 117 page book revolves around four major themes as condensed in itsfour chapters.
The parameters governing modern business; the significance of knowledge in modern management; existing paradigms in modern management and a summary of the industrial revolution from a strategy perspective. Throughout the book the author draws on his extensive military knowledge as a veteran lecturer for military and business students in several MBA programmes and provides reciprocal learning between aspects of military and business. 
In the first chapter Colonne highlights the four governing criteria of modern business, namely uncertainty, ambiguity, paradox and chaos. While referring to phenomena such as Black Swan Events, he also explains uncertainty through several other aspects such as coin uncertainty and coconut uncertainty. A condition common to the Coin, Dice, Subway, and Racetrack uncertainties is if probabilities of occurrences of all likely outcomes are added, it amounts to 100%. In regard to Coconut Uncertainty, it is a sure 100% in the long run. He evidences these through several real life examples such as the Tsunami and cricket. In the case of ambiguity he feels that it is best for the entire industry to move forward cooperatively in convoy until the situation becomes clear. Paradox is again shown through several global examples from the LGBT community in the USA to cannabis legislation in California. Finally Chaos which can be triggered through the snowball effect the domino effect or the butterfly effect, and may lead to unstable or stable equilibrium, is evidenced primarily through the time of turbulence in Sri Lanka during the 1980s and the LTTE. 
The second chapter deals with the significance of knowledge in modern management. New knowledge management is all about how information is being gathered, organised and shared in an organization. At this point of the book, the author includes small witty paragraphs to give a layman reader an interval in-between understanding these concepts, although his use of practical examples ensures that even the normal reader will grasp the theories he explains. Knowledge is then explained through its three classifications: implicit, explicit and tacit knowledge. He also explains how knowledge deficiencies can be fulfilled only through cognitive development and this is of vital importance since there is now a shift from experience based management to knowledge based management. According to his military experience, this is a trend that is even seen in the Sri Lankan Army. 
The third area of the book deals with paradigms which according to the author needs to accommodate emerging contemporary knowledge, thinking patterns, physical and mental capabilities and technological progress, which are the four core facets of the operational framework of every human being. There is a need for new knowledge to be created in order to understand and explain new phenomena and this is seen through the new Army Capstone Concept, transformed by the US Army. Under thinking patterns, out of the box thinking is vital and it is important for a person to know how to use this concept. Lateral thinking is also another important aspect of thinking patterns. The author divides capabilities into two categories of physical and mental which he explains through the Indian Tarahumaras tribe who are unable to lie, and Freddy Markham who broke the world record for human powered vehicles, implying that a craving desire supplemented by enhanced confidence enables setting new standards. Finally technological progress is supplemented by numerous examples and according to the author future wars are going to be technologically driven such as with the use of photometric uniforms and one of the deadliest weapons in the world Metal Storm. He further explains two important concepts associated with paradigm: paradigm shift and paradigm blindness which are vital in relation to the development ofan industry. 

Throughout the book the author draws on his extensive military knowledge as a veteran lecturer for military and business students in several MBA programmes and provides reciprocal learning between aspects of military and business

The final chapter focuses on creativity and innovation. Creativity can generate either breakthrough creativity or incremental creativity and the author details one of the most significant creative academic conceptualizations of his which was the automation of the selection and ranking process of AFS scholarship applicants. In the second half of the chapter he deals with inventions, which he explains through its product life cycle and innovations which can be product innovations or process innovations and concept innovations. 
The way this book tackles managerial challenges through the abundance of examples and illustrations makes it accessible to anyone interested in understanding contemporary management

GMOA to launch 24-hour strike on May 17
	
The GMOA today said it would launch a countrywide 24-hour work stoppage on May 17 as a protest against the Free Trade Agreement (FTA) signed with Singapore, proposed Economic and Technology Cooperation Agreement (ETCA) with India and several other issues.
GMOA Secretary Haritha Aluthge told a news conference that the work stoppage would begin at 8.00 am at all government hospitals.
The work stoppage is certain. However, the authorities still have time to provide us with a resonable solution. They should not enter into or implement such agreements in an arbitrary manner without setting up a national policy on international trade agreements, he said.
Dr. Aluthge said the FTA recently signed with Singapore was not in line with the World Trade Organisation (WTO) participles and detrimental to the country. He said this FTA would create an open space for foreign countries to invade Sri Lanka's job market.
Dr. Aluthge said the FTA had not included a termination date and exit clause and such an agreement was disadvantageous to the country and that the authorities concerned had signed this FTA without presenting it to Parliament. He said International Trade Minister Malik Samarawickrama should be held responsible for it.
Sri Lanka and India are to hold the next round of official level talks on the proposed ETCA at the end of May. We are against it as well. That is why we have decided to launch this work stoppage on May 17, he said. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)

Husband smacks driver of hearse transporting wifes body
	
An incident where the husband of a dead woman had assaulted the driver of the hearse carrying her body and the driver losing control of the vehicle had resulted in the hearse toppling over on the road in Galenbindunuwewa on Wednesday.
This was reported from Sivalakulam Urakote where a woman had died on Wednesday morning and her husband and relatives had handed over the body for embalming to an undertaker. Once this task was done, the undertakers had arranged to deliver the body to the deceased woman's house. The deceased woman's husband too had accompanied the coffin and was seated by the side of the driver in the hearse.
The husband had been sobbing and wailing during this journey and when it approached the 17th mile post, he started attacking the hearse's driver.
Due to this sudden incident, the driver lost control of the vehicle, which skidded off the road and turned turtle. The impact however did not cause any damage to the coffin or to the corpse within.
The owner of the funeral parlour with no alternative option, had to deliver the coffin to the funeral house in another vehicle.(Pathum Dharshana)

I had to pull out pistol to get things done: Range Bandara
	
Irrigation, Water Management and Disaster Management State Minister Palitha Range Bandara said yesterday that the Anamaduwa Technical College was built using the Rs.38 million allocated for the purpose by the State, after he drew his pistol.
The minister made these remarks addressing a function to mark the launch of the Deduru Oya-Sengal Oya project that was held in the Deduru Oya embankment in Pallegama - Anamaduwa.
The State Minister said a bund needed to be constructed across the Deduru-Oya to enable the water to flow via the Sengal Oya into eight tanks in the Arachchikattuwa area.
The government had allocated Rs.350 million for the project which would see more than 2, 000 acres of land being cultivated. Many projects including the Ussana Irrigation project are being implemented.
Range Bandara said that he was voted in by the common masses and therefore he would never hesitate to do things that would benefit the people of the area.
"When I tried to get an Ocean University built in the Puttalam District, the minister who was in charge of the relevant ministry opposed the decision. When I attempted to start a technical college here the vital documents were hidden. This forced me to draw the pistol from my waist because I knew that only by acting in this manner could I get things done.The Technical College was now about to become a reality," he said.
MP Nalin Bandara, speaking on this occasion, said that the development work undertaken by the present government has not been conveyed to the public.
"The President and the Prime Minister are too good. Therefore, the country needs people who could draw their pistols and get things done," he said. (Jude Samantha)

Lack of Common sense in Colombo politics
	
In one of the media outlets where yellow journalism is the rule and the norm both, a media employee told the nation a few days ago that in Sri Lanka Corruption is the major problem. Not poverty, not riches and not racismhe stressed. 
Corruption does matter when the Telecom Regulatory Commission (TRC) directly under the President is accused of selling frequencies underhand and those at the top are implicated in the largest bond scam in history, defending then CBSL governor, his close ally. 
Yet for any Muslim person to publicly say racism in Sri Lanka is no major problem after Digana and with social media dominated by hardcore Sinhala Buddhist extremism, brings forth the question, what do these opinion makers in Colombo know of Sri Lanka Colombo is the city of all professionals, the educated and the opinion makers in Sri Lanka. 
All big cities, after they evolved with nation States, all along history were social centres that created new knowledge, culture, science and technology and also developed philosophy, political and economic theory and among many other novelties,were initial collectivising centres for radical social movements as well. It is so even today, in most mega cities that had evolved over Centuries in all Continents. There is good reason for that. Cities have economic power that bring together the academia, professionals and technocrats, facilitate research and organised social dialogue. Cities have the capacity to institutionalise social memory that includes documentation and provide easy access and better and faster communication than any village could. In short it is cities and not villages that have social space and social capital for intellectual engagements that can seek common good and a prosperous future. 
Colombo therefore should be that. Colombo should be where social dialogue takes place in seeking a better future. Where new knowledge is created for the future. And Colombo should be where intellectual discourses happen. Sadly, Colombo today, is anything but that. In Colombo, everything is being reduced to loud noises demanding investigations into corruption of the Rajapaksa era from this Yahapalana government that is even more corrupt than the Rajapaksas. All what Colombo pundits are busy talking about is political rivalry within political parties and among political leaders. All mainstream media, web news sites and social media dish out juicy news stories on crossovers, possible break-ups, promotions and demotions in government and in the two ruling partners. Most who think they are defenders of democratic rights want to be in the media making statements on corruption and demanding the peoples mandate of 2015 January be honoured, by this government that from day one was a gang of looters. Some are busy moving pawns on a dirty old chess board to checkmate Rajapaksa who has stepped on the chess board once again. Once again in Colombo, it is debating who the best Sinhala Buddhist candidate could be for the 2020 presidential election. Where are people and their major issues in these hotnews stories within gossip circles in the urban middle class Will any of their appeals and protests make this government of looters change course How much of these Colombo demands on the peoples mandate of 2015 January apply to the larger majority of the rural and the urban poor 
It is common knowledge, the peoples mandate of 2015 January had nothing to do with the 6.2 million people who voted against Rajapaksa. That only allowed a starving opposition to gang up with Rajapaksa rogues to hijack the government, in the most undemocratic manner. It allowed the UNP leadership to smuggle extremely undemocratic pieces of law into the 19 Amendment to stay in power for almost five and a half years (2015 January to August and four and a half years from there). Meanwhile, this good governance fraud allowed some odd characters from nowhere to land in Colombo to pose as die hard anti Rajapaksas and earn through yahapalana projects. Having created comfort zones for themselves these funded Colombo intellectuals would not bother to raise the major issues that within 03 years have left the people on a huge garbage dump called yahapalanaya. 
Over the years, the savagely ugly medical Mafia parading as the GMOA has turned the once broad based health system into a curative health system that demands money atevery level
It was common sense there could be nothing decent and democratic, nothing clean and civilised with a government formed with those who were responsible for all the alleged Rajapaksa corruption and misrule. It was common sense that everyone from the previous regime who joined with the UNP that was starved of power for 20 years, did not label this unholy, unprincipled government as yahapalanaya to serve the people. It is no joke for those who spoke, stood up and voted for the 18th Amendment of Rajapaksa to have voted for the 19th Amendment of Wickremesinghe too that denies the people an election for a period of four and a half years, for change of government. Both the 18 and the 19th Amendments for the two reasons of removing the 02 term limit for presidency and denying elections for four and a half years, should have gone before the people with a Referendum. Yet the Supreme Court did not rule so. 
These political parties do not represent people.They are totally corrupt and they are run by the filthy rich. Even the man on the street knows they dont discuss and they are not capable of discussing any of the major issues that need serious answers. The whole education system is collapsing. Education today from pre-school to university is no learning process. The academia is corrupt and selfish, making universities far worse than Maha Vidyalayas. Education is reduced to heavily competitive exams from Grade V to G.C.E A/L in a wholly uneven field of opportunities and a chaotic teaching profession. Schools are buildings where children are taught to answer question papers and not centres where children are guided to learn. Education today is only about collecting certificates to demand employment. Education has to be redefined.This education system thereafter has to be seriously reformed with long term answers to mould future citizens.That needs a carefully drafted White Paper on Education Reforms for public debate. 
Free health today is a myth, completely dominated by a greedy, selfish and a morally degenerated medical profession. Over the years, the savagely ugly medical Mafia parading as the GMOA has turned the once broad based health system into a curative health system that demands money at every level. In a fast ageing society where gastritis, diabetes, high blood pressure and cholesterol are very common issues, an open-heart surgery even at the Sri Jayawardenepura hospital costs around one million rupees. Health today is not defined and financed in terms of improving and expanding preventive healthcare to reduce patients, but is about paying medical doctors more and more from tax payers money. The health sector has thus been turned into a lucrative trade for big private investment. 
So is commuter transport where thousands of vehicles get jammed daily, even on fly-over bridges built with billions of borrowed money. Individual ownership of two, three and four wheel vehicles as the wallets permit, is the norm in daily travel. It has allowed a fleecing trade of vehicle imports and sales. Added is the massive import bill for fuel. The net result is the time lost on the roads by people who have to travel up and down for work. They dont talk of distance in travelling, but the time taken to travel. All governments beginning with President Jayawardene has only thought of widening roads and building highways that has not in anyway helped daily commuting. The most who get bogged down in city traffic, the urban middle class shows no interest in alternatives and in proposing an efficient, comfortable and an economically viable public commuter service that can include both rail and road. 
Why young women from rural communities want to migrate as housemaids in Mid East countries for 30,000 rupees per month. Will they leave their kith and kin, if their families could earn at least 20,000 rupees regularly in their own villages
There is also no questioning as to why young women from rural Sinhala, Tamil and Muslim communities want to migrate as housemaids to slog in Mid East countries that carry stories about stoning, nailing, sexually and physically abusing, for a paltry sum of about 30,000 rupees per month. Will they leave their kith and kin, if their families could earn at least 20,000 rupees regularly in their own villages There are absolutely no answers for these rural lives in their own rural economies. 
So have all the post war issues, North and East is agitating for 09 long years, demanding answers. For the Colombo anti Rajapaksa pundits, they dont seem to come within the 2015 January mandate to demand answers from this yahapalana government, now far more racist than even Rajapaksa. 
All these major issues have been drowned in useless, meaningless and never productive talk on party rivalries, leadership tussles, next presidential candidate for Sinhala Buddhists.The urban middle class is nevertheless comfortable with all that, as long as they could earn the extra double buck in this rotting system. For them therefore, a collapsing education, an ailing health system, a jam packed road network and a village for an annual retreat are all part of urban living that has money. They therefore dont need any change. All they want is this yahapalanaya in some form, that can give them freedom to enjoy economic space liberally and not common sense to understand that chaos around them would before long, leave them also on a garbage dump that will be far more difficult to clean up than now, unless an alternate development programme is dialogued in society.

Mahnedran's hide and seek game is short lived: Rajitha
	
Cabinet spokesman and Minister. Rajitha Senaratne yesterday said Arjuna Mahendran would be arrested by the Interpol from wherever he was hiding and handed over to the Sri Lankan Police no sooner than later.
Dr. Snaratne added that no one knew his whereabouts but he would not be able to play this hide and seek game for too long.
However, he said he sometimes felt whether only the Yahapalana Government was concerned about judicial independence when the media questions on how former Defence Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa continued to get bail without arrest despite the FCID filing charges against him under the provisions of the Public Property Act.
Addressing the media at the weekly cabinet news briefing, Minister Senaratne said the media must think whether any other average citizen had this luxury.
The question and answer session that ensued at the news briefing is as follows.
Daily Mirror:
The entire country expects quick legal action against the suspects of the Central Bank Bond Scam. Now that the Judicature Amendment Bill that paves the way for setting up of Special Trials at Bar for speedier administration of justice, could we expect the bond scam be referred to one of these special High Courts as the first case for trial
Minister Senaratne:
This has to be decided by the Hon. Chief Justice after high profile cases were referred to him by the AG.
Daily Mirror:
You get a lot of flak from many quarters for not taking action against wrong doers of the previous government. Dont you want to punish them
Minister Senaratne:
It was me and a few other Ministers with a backbone who questioned President Mahinda Rajapaksa face to face on various crimes committed under him.
Daily Mirror:
Where is the delay
Minister Senaratne: You decide yourself as to how and why those who had properties in Gampaha, Matara, Kduwela and many other places worth millions of rupees got off the hook from the law and finally their properties were forfeited.
A lady journalist from a private TV station: When do you arrest the first accused of the bond scam Arjuna Mahendran
Minister Senaratne: Pretty soon.
Journalist: Why this delay to arrest him;
Minister Senaratne: (in a raised tone)
Why do you ask only about the arrest of Arjuna Mahendran. Why do you never ask the delay running to several months to arrest Udayanga Weeratunga who is involved in fraudulent MIG deal and caused losses millions of dollars to the government Why you have never asked about the Jaliya Wickramasuiriya who fled the country and evade arrest for months The losses incurred to the government from the bond scam is only Rs. 10 billion and the government has suspended accounts of Perpetual Treasuries Ltd. worth over Rs. 11 billion, much less than the losses from MIG deal.
Why dont you ever ask about the allegations leveled against nearly 30 Rajapaksa family members and their acolytes You have never asked me about private TV station CSN owned by Yoshitha.
Journalist: What is progress that has been made to arrest Arjuna Mahendran by the government
Minister Senaratne:
The government has done all it could do to arrest him and bring him back. It is up to the Sri Lanka Police, the Interpol and the country where he is in hiding. If and when he was arrested in a foreign country, we must have an Extradition treaty to bring him back to Sri Lanka. If not we have to seek other legal avenues to bring him here. It takes time because Interpol is in France, not in SRI Lanka.
Journalist:
Is there a move to taken over Samurdhi Banks under the Central Bank
Minister Senaratne:
Yes. It is necessary because all commercial banks must come under the scrutiny of the government.
Journalist:
But you can initiate an inquiry under the Money Laundering Act if Samurdhi Banks have committed any financial irregularities.
Minister Senaratne:
If so, all other banls also can be scruitinized under the provisions of the MLA. Thousands of Samurdhi Banks established to assist poor to stand on their own feet cannot be run in the manner that Danduwam Mudalalai or Sakwithi did their transactions. (Sandun A Jayasekera)

New Judicature Act gives fresh hope for justice
	
History tells us that in a democratic society, justice delayed is justice denied. We also know that justice hurried could turn out to be justice miscarried or buried. Therefore, as in so many vital areas, a reasonable solution lies in the middle path.
Parliament on Wednesday passed a bill to set up Special High Courts through which the government says it hopes to expedite cases involving large-scale bribery, corruption, fraud or other political crimes. 
The Judicature (Amendment) Bill was passed with amendments as recommended by the Supreme Court which had ruled that if those amendments were not made the passage of the bill would require a two-thirds majority which the coalition government may not be able to get because of the recent crossovers. After the second reading, the bill received 119 votes in favour and 52 against. That means a majority of 67 votes. The vote was conducted electronically. Thereafter, the third reading or the committee stage debate took place and the Bill was passed without a vote being taken. 
In terms of the Act, permanent High Courts at Bar will be set up to try, hear and determine the trials of the offences specified in the Sixth Schedule of the Act. 
The Act is expected to expedite the judicial process of cases regarding serious frauds, corruption and other high profile crimes. 
The sixth schedule includes dishonest misappropriation of Property, criminal breach of trust by public servants in respect of money, forgery for the purpose of cheating, falsification of accounts, conspiracy and Abeitment to commit the offences of the Penal Code set out in this Schedule, offence of money laundering, conspiracy and abeitment to commit the offences under the prevention of Money Laundering Act, bribery of Judicial Officers and Members of Parliament, acceptance of gratification by Members of Parliament for interviewing public officers.
The schedule also includes bribery of police officers, peace officers and other public officers, bribery for giving assistance or using influence in regard to contracts, bribery for procuring withdrawal of tenders, bribery in respect of government business, bribery in connection with payment of claims, appointments, employments, grants, leases, and other benefits, bribery of public officers by persons having dealings with the government, bribery of a member of local authority, or of a scheduled institution, or of a governing body of a scheduled institution, and bribery of officer or employee of local authority or such institution, to own or to have owned property deemed under this section to be property acquired by bribery or property to which property acquired by bribery has or had been converted, accept of gratification, any act constituting an offence under Foreign Exchange Act or the Banking Act, any act constituting an offence under Registered Stocks and Securities Ordinance, any act constituting an offence under Local Treasury Bills Act, any act constituting an offence under Securities and Exchange Commission of Sri Lanka Act,any act constituting an offence under Regulation of Insurance Industry Act. 
Joint opposition members opposed the Bill on the basis that it was meant to take revenge on the former regimes top politicians and officials. But Justice Minister Thalatha Athukorala and other government front liners pointed out that in terms of the prevailing justice system the completion of trials took up to two decades. They said the coalition government during the campaign for the January 8, 2015 Presidential Election had assured the people that the system would be speeded up to bring to justice the former regimes top politicians and officials who are alleged to have plundered billions of dollars from public funds. Government leaders said that even politicians now in public office and public servants would be brought to trial before the Special High Courts with the three-judge benches being named by the Chief Justice. The cases would be filed by the Criminal Investigations Department (CID), the Financial Crimes Investigations Department (FCID) and the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption (CIABOC). 
Hopefully with the three-judge benches meeting daily, morning and afternoon, for a particular trial, most trials could be concluded in one to three months. 
The peoples hope would be that those who betrayed them and plundered public money would be brought to justice and also that the billions of plundered dollars would be recovered and used for the sustainable and all inclusive development process that would pave the way for a just society.

Preserve your childs smile!
	

The failure to pay adequate attention to the care of a childs primary teeth, more commonly known as milk teeth, is a common occurrence. Most of the time it happens due to the assumption of the parents that since milk teeth remain in the mouth for only a few years of the child s life and are replaced with permanent teeth later, they do not require much care. This is a common misconception since milk teeth play a very important part in the childs development process and therefore demand proper care. We decided to consult Dr. Gamini Wimalasena, Regional Dental Surgeon, Gampaha, to obtain information on the importance of milk teeth, and about the condition called Baby Bottle Tooth Decay which affects milk teeth. 

Importance of milk teeth
Milk teeth plays a big role in the growth and development of a child. Not only do they aid a child in the chewing process, speaking and when smiling, milk teeth act as a pathway for permanent teeth to develop later, explained Dr. Wimalasena. Primary teeth save space in the jaw for the permanent teeth, until they are ready to develop. Therefore, the health of your childs primary teeth would decide how his permanent teeth are going to take shape. 
We have seen children with only the root of the primary teeth remaining due to decaying. Not only are they exposed to an increased risk of developing permanent crooked teeth, they are more likely to experience a loss or decay in their teeth in early life, states Dr. Wimalasena. 

Baby Bottle Tooth Decay
Baby Bottle Tooth Decay, also known as early childhood caries and feeding bottle syndrome, is the decaying of the teeth of a baby since their first appearance in the mouth. This syndrome is present in some kids until around five to six years of age. This is the period when the existed teeth start to be replaced by permanent teeth. The upper front teeth are the most susceptible, but other teeth can also be affected, explained the doctor. 

How it happens
The condition occurs largely due to artificial sugars staying in the surface of the teeth. This environment provides a good medium for certain bacteria to grow on the teeth. These bacteria breaks down sugar into acids which results in damaging and decaying of the structure of the enamel. Since milk teeth have a very thin enamel and a more delicate structure when compared to the permanent teeth, they are more likely to develop caries,Dr. Wimalasena further said. 

Prevention
As the name itself implies, bottle feeding could be a major contributory factor for tooth decay. Therefore its crucial to discourage formula feeding for an infant and opt for exclusive breast feeding for six months.
This process must be followed by breast feeding with complementary food for around two years. The doctor advises the use of a spoon in place of a teat, when giving food.  Establishing the habit of brushing their teeth at least twice daily from a young age would help towards the prevention of caries, not only during early childhood, but later in life as well, stated Dr. Wimalasena.
This should be done under adult supervision, making sure that the child does not swallow the toothpaste while brushing, he continued. 
Taking calcium rich food and brushing the teeth with a fluoride containing toothpaste will also aid in maintaining continuous health of the teeth, added the doctor. 

Treatment
Treatment method will depend upon the severity of the decay, stated Dr. Wimalasena. If the caries are not extensive, the gap can be closed using dental fillers. This will be carried out by a School Dental Therapist or a Dental Surgeon. Counseling of a child exposed to high risk and his or her parents will also be done.  If the tooth has suffered extensive damage, it may need removal. A space maintainer is applied to the gap left after removing the tooth to guide the permanent tooth in the correct pathway, he explained. 

Message to readers
Dr. Wimalasena has several important messages for our readers. Bacteria like lactobacillus and streptococcus, which are the root cause of tooth decay, enter the mouth of a baby through the tiny particles of saliva ejected from the mouths of people who have close contact with him. Therefore, maintaining good oral hygiene in parents as well as other close contacts of the baby like grandparents, is important in maintaining oral hygiene, stated the doctor. In our country the antenatal clinic package for pregnant mothers includes a dental appointment as well. So its important to make use of this visit to ensure the oral hygiene of the mother, even before the baby arrives, he further explained. 
Taking the child for school dental visits at least 6 monthly during early childhood would also help maintain their oral health. 
The importance of the use of a fluoride containing toothpaste cannot be stressed enough, he said while explaining that using fluoridated toothpaste, even in areas where water has a high fluoride content, will have a local effect on the teeth, protecting them. 
Using proper techniques when brushing teeth, ensuring personal hygiene and taking nutritious food which has minimal artificial sugar, will be beneficial in the long run in preserving your childs smile, he concluded.

Presidents blurred mission beyond 2020
	
President Maithripala Sirisena had declared that he would not retire from politics in 2020
He said he had to complete his mission to serve the people and thecountry
He had sought a determination from the Supreme Court this year as to when his term of officewould expire

President Maithripala Sirisena had declared that he would not retire from politics in 2020 as he had to complete his mission to serve the people and the country beyond 2020. He was speaking at the Sri Lanka Freedom Partys May Day rally at Chenkaladi which was held on May 7 as the generally accepted May Day, May 1 fell within theVesak week.
Citing the reason for this statement he said that the media and many others kept asking him whether he would quit politics in 2020. However, we do not remember anybody asking him that question in the recent past. It is he who seems to have wanted to tell the country that he was not going to retire from politics in 2010 as he had vowed during the last Presidential election campaign. 
Also it is because of his earlier assertion that he would become President of the country only once that President Sirisenas May Day declaration gained high significance and almost all Sinhala and English newspapers had it as their lead story on the next day. However, this was not the first time the President gave this message to the country. It must be recalled that he had sought a determination from the Supreme Court in January this year as to when his term of office would expire and this was viewed by many as an indication of his aspiration to stay in power beyond 2020. Again on January 18, while addressing a meeting in Kosgama the President had vowed that he would leave office only after sending the corrupt politicians to hell.
With the SLPP unofficially led by former President sweeping the electorate at the February 10 local government elections, the Presidents fear of facing the wrath of Rajapaksas wouldhave multiplied
One may argue that Presidents declaration that he would not retire in 2020 did not necessarily mean that he would contest the Presidential election in 2020. Yet, when he said that he would not retire because he had to complete his mission to serve the people it clearly meant that he wanted to continue what he does now. There are no alternatives to the presidency for him to complete his mission to serve the people.


When he came forward to challenge his former boss, Mahinda Rajapaksa in 2014 there were no reasons for him to declare that he would become the President only once. Nobody wanted him to do so or nobody asked him whether he would contest the Presidential election for a second time. Therefore, he might have really meant it.
But now, not only after shattering Mahinda Rajapaksas hopes for a lifelong presidency but also after threatening the entire Rajapaksa family with imprisonment, he seems to feel insecure. He as a former member of the Rajapaksa administration knows very well how Rajapaksas punished their adversaries such as former Army Commander Sarath Fonseka and former Chief Justice Shirani Bandaranayake for challenging them. 
Even before Gotabaya Rajapaksa, Namal Rajapaksa, Yoshitha Rajapaksa, Basil Rajapaksa and Shiranthi Rajapaksa were hauled before courts of law, the President had told he would have been six feet under the ground had he been defeated at the last Presidential election. In last November while accusing the UNP at a Cabinet meeting for delaying and stalling legal action against corruption committed by the leaders of the former regime, the President had also expressed his fear of Rajapaksas making a comeback by reportedly saying that in such an eventuality it is not the UNP that is going to face the consequences.
With the government hauling the members of the Rajapaksa family before the courts, the small parties of the UPFA starting the Rise with Mahinda campaign, Rajapaksas successfully bounced back for their survival and security
With the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) unofficially led by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa sweeping the electorate at the February 10 local government elections, President Sirisenas fear of facing the wrath of Rajapaksas would have multiplied. Nonetheless, he is deprived of options other than fighting back politically as the former President did or fleeing the country. He seems to have opted to face the situation politically and hence has declared that he would not retire in 2020.
Former President Rajapaksa also chose to fight back under a similar situation. He and his loyalists were also in a quandary and seemed to have been frightened when Maithripala Sirisena assumed office as the Executive President. They seemed to have feared that the new President would use his executive powers against them as Mahinda Rajapaksa did against his adversaries.
Hence, Basil Rajapaksa left the country and stayed in the US for several months. Mahinda Rajapaksa voluntarily offered to hand over the Chairmanship of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) to President Sirisena. The 142 United Peoples Freedom Alliance (UPFA) MPs who backed Rajapaksa did not dare to challenge President Sirisena when he appointed Ranil Wickremesinghe who commanded the confidence of only 47 MPs in the Parliament to the post of Prime Minister on January 9, 2015. They who voted for the 18th Amendment to the Constitution that removed the two term limit for the President and scrapped the independent commissions supported the 19th Amendment to the Constitution which re-introduced that term limit and the independent commissions.
However, with the government hauling the members of the Rajapaksa family one by one before the courts of law and the small parties of the UPFA starting the Rise with Mahinda campaign Rajapaksas successfully bounced back for their survival and security. Now they have turned the political trend in favour of themselves which was clearly evident at the recent local government elections.
The Presidents desire to complete his mission to serve the people and the country beyond 2020 would literally be an uphill struggle
Nevertheless, there is a major difference between Rajapaksas and Maithripala Sirisena fighting back. The former had the popular support which is the main ingredient of any political struggle to bounce back. Majority of the SLFP and the UPFA was with them in spite of Mahinda Rajapaksa being defeated at the last Presidential election. On the other hand, despite President Sirisena holding the leadership of the SLFP and the UPFA he does not have such a support base. The 1.5 million voters who voted for the SLFP and the UPFA at the local government elections cannot be deemed to be a permanent vote bank, in the light of the turn of political trend after the recent local polls. 
Another handicap with President Sirisena is the hostile attitude held by the government towards him. In spite of certain democratic reforms having been brought in after the regime change in 2015, the President himself accused the UNP of scuttling his anti-corruption drive which he was to use as a cudgel against the leaders of the former regime and he too now seems to toe the same line, for fear of revenge by the same leaders. Neither he nor his government has any plan to economically support the masses and win over their support before 2020. Hence, the Presidents desire to complete his mission to serve the people and the country beyond 2020 would literally be an uphill struggle.

Rupee depreciation led to fuel hike: Ravi
	
Several causes including the depreciation of rupee to satisfy the IMF had resulted in the increase of fuel prices, former minister Ravi Karunanayake said today.
He said the increase of fuel prices in the international market may have also played a role in increased prices.
If we reduced taxes on fuel, there is no need to increase fuel prices. We dont have to execute all IMF proposals. We should only take whats good for us. Though the government was changed the state officials remain the same. Ghosts of the previous government still haunt the Central Bank and parts of the Finance Ministry. We said these things back then as well, he said.
Instead of increasing prices of fuel, taxes on fuel should have been reduced or other alternatives should have been sought, he said.
He said that for the first time in the history fuel price to be revised every two months affecting many sectors including the transport sector in the country.
However, the MP said as we cannot control the world market there should be a solid mechanism such as maintaining fuel stocks which could be used when world market prices go up.
He said introducing price formulas to revise the prices twice a month would not be an efficient method and therefore country need to focus on a lasting method. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

Spotlight on eroding womens status  in an island
	
Its interesting to note however that those who attended mixed schools behave better in society
In the villages, property was given much higher value over women
King Kashyapa of Seegiriya is said to have had 500 wives and is likened as the 5th Century Hugh Hefner
A close look at the Sri Lankan society shows that the average Sri Lankan male is sexually frustrated
Sri Lankan culture is so deep-rooted that it has a special place for women. This is showcased during Sinhala-Buddhist weddings where much of the rituals are centred around the bride. Sri Lankans even had a ceremony called the Isa Diya Mangalyaya during which a brides virginity is subject to a test. This tradition is not practised today, except in villages and by a few aristocratic families. 
But despite all these traditions, which show the lofty status given to women in the Sri Lankan society, the fairer sex are subject to much harassment in the island. 
The recent incident in Mirissa where a Dutch female tourist was harassed by a beach boy put Sri Lanka under the spotlight as a country where white women should be extra careful, if they happen to visit this island. 
A close look at the Sri Lankan society shows that the average Sri Lankan male is sexually frustrated. A German female tourist whom this writer had the opportunity to converse with not very long ago said that she was bugged by males between the ages 18-30 during her stay in Sri Lanka. She said that she was travelling to Kandy by bus and many of these males who approached her were passengers on the bus.
It was writers like Sumithra Rahubadda, Rupa Kodithuwakku, Anula de Silva, Lelishiya Botheju, Irene Siriwardene and Dharma Samaranayake who started highlighting womens issues in their pieces of writing

The Sri Lankan culture doesnt afford much opportunities for boys to mingle with girls. Most schools make recruitments strictly based on gender. Its interesting to note however that those who attended mixed schools behave better in society and know how to respect women. This separation of boys from the girls happens after the latter attains age. This is not the case in other European countries which are rated as triple A Nations; countries which offer a luxury life to its citizens compared to what Sri Lanka offers. 
Playboy mansion 
Tracing the footsteps of our ancestors we can observe that women were used as tools for sex. King Kashyapa of Seegiriya is said to have had 500 wives and is likened as the 5th Century Hugh Hefner. Sigiriya was his playboy mansion.

In the villages, property was given much higher value over women. This is why they had the tradition called Eka gey kema. In this system two brothers share the same wife to avoid the family wealth from being divided. 
There was a recent post on Facebook which underscored the depth of a woman. It said, The well-read woman is a dangerous creature
We have records of women belonging to the Rodiya clan going to sleep with rich planters. Among the Rodiya community, Polyandry was considered honourable. The British made both Polyandry and Polygamy illegal in 1859, but the practice continued nevertheless.

Even the early Sinhala novels and short stories never highlighted womens issues. It was writers like Sumithra Rahubadda, Rupa Kodithuwakku, Anula de Silva, Lelishiya Botheju, Irene Siriwardene and Dharma Samaranayake who started highlighting womens issues in their pieces of writing. The male Sri Lankan writers before them failed to touch on this segment of the society in their work. 
In most African and Asian countries, including Sri Lanka, women take the initiative when one of the partners has to sacrifice the job for the sake of the child. This is probably because a woman also has the inbuilt characteristics of a mother whose role the male might struggle to play. The following poem by Maya Angelm and titled Woman work confirms this. 
Ive got the children to tend
The clothes to mend
The floor to mop
The food to shop
The chicken to fry
The baby to dry

The role of counsellor
The woman as a mother also plays the role of counsellor in the family. This writer recalls a story in the Asian edition of Readers Digest where a daughter was devastated after her boyfriend had dumped her. After seeing the daughter going without food and drink for a lengthy period, the mother one day took her lipstick and scribbled this message on the
mirror of the daughters dressing table: When half gods go, real gods come. The daughter bounced back to her usual cheerful mood the moment she read this. 
There was a recent post on Facebook which underscored the depth of a woman. It said, The well-read woman is a dangerous creature. The following poem by Courtney Kane and titled Depth of a woman gives a hint as to what a woman is capable of. 
There is depth in me that is
Much like the sea
And on the days of my greatest gleam
I am a woman who manages
What some say is the impossible
Its the opinion of many that Sri Lankan males should spend more time on understanding their women. Actor Will Smith washes clothes at home not because he cant afford a servant, but because he loves his wife. If males understand the fact that love and respect are two words that open the door to the heart of a woman this island would be a true paradise. 
The mother is the first female that a boy comes in contact with. He grows up with her till he is ready to enter wedlock. During these early years in life these males must look around at home and observe the fact that everything works like a well-oiled machine. Why Because the mothers have given the place a feminine touch. 
History shows us that women have reached the status of being worshipped, the best examples coming from India. Many hope that the incident in Mirissa would not be repeated and hotel and restaurant owners would do all they can to ensure that female tourists are safe when they visit Sri Lanka. This is an island which doesnt have to be reminded that its history is full of stories where women playing the roles of mothers, teachers and wives have inspired the nation. Women can be venerated as Gods and demi gods are. The following line from the poem penned by poet Aido Kraas in his work titled Hymn to the woman underscores this. You are Gods gift to the world.

Temporary terminal at BIA to ease congestion: Minister
	
A temporary terminal would be built at the Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA) in Katunayake within six months as a solution to the increasing congestion at the airport, Transport and Civil Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala De Silva said today.
He told Parliament that the contract undertaken by the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) to build the second terminal at the BIA had to be cancelled as its estimate was 45 per cent higher than that of the government engineers.
We will call for tenders again for the construction of the second terminal which will take another four to five years to complete. In the meantime, we will construct a temporary terminal by the end of this year," he said.
The minister said passengers at the BIA were increasing annually, with about 10 million passengers having used the airport in 2017 in comparison to 8.5 million in 2015 and 9.4 million in 2016.
He said aircraft movements had also increased by 10.6 per cent.
Mr. De Silva yesterday submitted the Civil Aviation (Amendment) Bill to bring in new laws to prevent agents entering the airport illegally and engaging in illegal activities which inconvenience passengers.
The minister said steps would be taken to upgrade the Ratmalana Domestic Airport to facilitate private jets and flight schools.
"A huge area of the Ratmalana airport is occupied by the air force and after lengthy discussions they have agreed to release 25 acres to the civil aviation authority. We agreed to provide them Rs. 725 million to shift their hangers and other equipment," he said.
The minister said they were studying the possibility of constructing the second runway at the BIA to cater to the increasing demand. (Ajith Siriwardana and Yohan Perera)

Trump-Kim summit set for June
	
US, (Daily Mail), 10 May 2018 -
US President Donald Trump on Thursday revealed his historic summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un will take place in Singapore on June 12.
The location and date of the landmark meeting -- the first ever between a sitting US president and a North Korean leader -- were announced by presidential tweet just hours after North Korea released three American prisoners.
US officials said their freedom removed the last major obstacle, providing Trump with tangible evidence that his twin-track policy of engagement and maximum pressure was working.
We will both try to make it a very special moment for World Peace! Trump wrote.
Technically the United States and North Korea are still at war -- a stop-gap armistice ended the brutal three year war between the two countries in 1953 and around 30,000 US troops remain in neighboring South Korea.

## Title: Trumps Iran deal pullout and  the dangers ahead

Trumps Iran deal pullout and  the dangers ahead
	
The United States President Donald Trumps much-anticipated withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal -- also known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA)  has exposed his insensitivity to world peace and nuclear nonproliferation and contributed to an escalation in the multiple conflicts ripping the Middle East apart. No sooner the US pulled out of the Iran accord than clashes erupted between Israel and Iran.
By undermining the Iran nuclear accord, Trump is obviously sending a wrong signal to North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, whom he will be meeting at the end of this month or early next month for talks aimed at North Koreas nuclear disarmament.
North Korea, which blames the US for torpedoing the six-party agreement, must now be having serious issues about trusting a US administration. Dishonoring treaties is a feature of uncivilized conduct befitting the Nazis. Adolf Hitler signed the Munich agreement in 1938 with the European powers and the MolotovRibbentrop Pact a year later with the Soviet Union, but he observed the treaties in the breach and launched surprise attacks on Soviet positions in Poland and invaded Czechoslovakia, thus starting the Second World War. Ironically, in a statement in support of Trumps decision to pull out of the Iran deal, Saudi Arabias Crown Prince Muhammad bin Salman equated the Iran accord to the 1938 Munich Pact, though it is Trump who has committed a Hitler-like act.
We wonder whether Trump had ever heard the Latin phrase pacta sunt servanda -- meaning that agreements must be kept. To expect that a witless president known for his regular gaffes will observe international law principles may be too much to ask from him.
May be his Tuesdays statement was made by his neocon speechwriters, but if he had been smart enough, he would surely have noted the blunders in it; he would have desisted from praising the tyrannical era that preceded the 1979 Iranian revolution; and he would not have accused Iran of supporting terror groups Al Qaeda and the Taliban. Trump is an embarrassment to Americans because he does not know that the Taliban and al-Qaeda are against Iran. The two Wahhabi groups have killed Iranian diplomats in Afghanistan and are waging a worldwide war against Shiite Muslims. What a shame, a man who does not know such basic facts is heading the so-called greatest nation on earth. Or is he deliberately lying in preparation for a major war against Iran, just as George W Bush did when he deliberately misled the American people into believing that Iraqs Saddam Hussein had links with al-Qaeda, the group which is said to have carried out the 9/11 attacks
We wonder whether Trump had ever heard the Latin phrase pacta sunt servanda -- meaning that agreements must be kept. To expect that a witless president known for his regular gaffes will observe international law principles may be too much to ask from him
By pulling out of the Iran deal despite warnings from the United States closest European allies and the deals co-signatories, Britain, France and Germany, that such action risks plunging the Middle East into further chaos, the Trump administration is only making Israel, Saudi Arabia and sectarian terrorists happy. But the US has indeed violated international law, because the Iran accord carries the United Nations Security Councils endorsement.
Now that the US has withdrawn from the JCPOA, Iran will certainly do what it takes to further its national interest. But Trumps reckless act does spell disaster to the rest of the world. Certainly, it has pushed the world towards war, halted the momentum towards nuclear nonproliferation and brought upon economic hardships on developing countries like Sri Lanka. Often, US sanctions have made poor countries poorer. In the 1990s, the US sanctions dealt a severe blow to Sri Lankas economy because they prevented Sri Lanka from exporting tea and other items to Iraq. Similarly, the US sanctions on Iran prevented Sri Lanka from buying Irans oil at concessionary prices or on a buy-now-and-pay-later basis. In addition, every time, sanctions were in force, oil prices went up. This is no good news for a developing country struggling to cope with a balance of payment crisis. Well, there is no altruism in the US foreign policy. The Trump administration is least concerned about the impact of sanctions on developing nations, which he only recently described as shit hole countries.
In about six months, the US sanctions will come into force, preventing once again countries from buying Irans oil and maintaining trade ties with it. In terms of the US sanctions aimed at crippling Irans economy, companies and banks which transact with Iran will be prevented from doing business with the US and US companies. It is indeed an affront to a countrys sovereignty when its companies or entities are threatened with punishment by another country.
The Trump administration, together with Israel and Saudi Arabia, hopes the re-imposition of tough sanctions will plunge Irans crisis-ridden economy into deeper stagnation, prompting the people to rise against the Government. They hope that with the support of regime haters within Iran, a concerted military action by the US, Israel and Saudi Arabia could lead to the toppling of the government -- a formula that worked in Afghanistan, Iraq and Libya. But Iran wont be an easy target for the US-led regime changers. Iran has gone through nearly four decades of Western sanctions, only to emerge stronger. Thanks to these sanctions, Iran is self-sufficient in agriculture, and has made great strides in industries and weapons technology. Iranians often unite behind the Government in the face of an external threat.

How will Iran respond to the Trump blow Irans Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has warned that Iran would light the agreement on fire if the US withdrew from it, while President Hasan Rouhani said he had given orders to Irans nuclear scientists to be prepared to resume the nuclear programme. Despite such strong rhetoric, Iran has exercised restraint and said it would stick by the agreement in deference to the accords other signatories  Russia, China, France, Britain and Germany.
But the biggest question is the US sanctions. The European powers may find it difficult to help Iran circumvent the US sanctions. This is because no European company would like to be blacklisted by the US for transacting with Iran. Already, Chinas mobile giant Huawei is being probed by the US Justice Department for its alleged dealings with Iran in contravention of the US sanctions law.
If Iran fails to receive the economic benefits for being in the nuclear deal, it may be forced to nullify it and follow the North Korean example. It may resume its nuclear programme, test a nuclear device as soon as it can and then, like Kim Jong-un has done, could negotiate with the US from a position of strength.
Irans resolve to meet fire with fire was seen on Wednesday when it fired rockets at the Israeli occupied Golan Height in response to Israeli missile attacks on Iranian military installations in Syria. The clashes indicate that Israel, may be on behalf of Saudi Arabia, may be going for a full scale war with Iran, with a view to ousting the Bashar al-Assad regime and handing Syria over to pro-West terrorists and raw liver eaters. But it is easier said than done.

UNP to appoint CEO to oversee 'Sirikotha'
	
The United National Party (UNP) is set to appoint a Chief Executive Officer (CEO) to look after the affairs of its headquarters, Sirikotha, party sources said yesterday.
Sources said the main objective behind the creation of this post is to see that Sirikotha is run effectively and efficiently. One of the main functions of the CEO would be to assist the General Secretary of the party in running the headquarters, sources said.
Sources added that the appointment of a CEO was one of the main recommendations made by the Ruwan Wijewardene committee which was formed to look into the reorganization of the UNP.
The post of CEO of the party is expected to be a full-time post, therefore ministers and MPs will be prevented from taking up the position, according to these sources.
Meanwhile, several UNP back-benches are also expected to be given positions within the party. (Yohan Perera)

Wrong for Govt. to increase fuel prices: Bimal
	
JVP MP Bimal Ratnayake said yesterday it was unreasonable for the government to increase fuel prices by citing the fuel price increase in the world market and the depreciation of the rupee, while hiding the excessive taxes imposed on fuel.
He said the government imposed a tax of Rs.45 on petrol and Rs.23 on diesel, according to statistics provided by the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) to the COPE.
"Although the cost of a litre of octane 92 petrol is Rs.72 with all production and other costs, it was sold at Rs.117 including a rupee tax of Rs.45/50. The cost of a litre of octane 95 petrol is Rs.83 and sold at Rs.128," he said and added that a tax of Rs.23/49 was imposed on a litre of auto diesel.
The MP said the government had burdened the people through the Inland Revenue Act introduced recently and added that it could have decreased tax temporarily and provided a concession to the people, without burdening them further.
"The government is not taking any action to cut down on its unnecessary expenses and is maintaining a huge cabinet, violating the Constitution, though the national government was no longer valid," he said. (Ajith Siriwardana and Yohan Perera)
