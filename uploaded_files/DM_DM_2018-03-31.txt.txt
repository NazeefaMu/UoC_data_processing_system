Article on tobacco farming: misleading
	

Response to Daily Mirror Article Manipulative tobacco cultivation no more a profitable livelihood. Tobacco Free Nation: Sri Lankas Dream dated March 26.
The All Island Cigarette Tobacco Barn Owners Association (AICTBOA), would like to respond to the alleged misleading information and allegations contained in the article Manipulative tobacco cultivation no more a profitable livelihood. Tobacco Free Nation: Sri Lankas Dream published on March 26.

In fact, Sri Lanka was one of the first countries in the world to eliminate the use of wood for tobacco curing

We would like to start by saying that this article and the attempt made by Dr. Mahesh Rajasuriya to tarnish the image of tobacco farmers and tobacco farming in Sri Lanka is a good example of people with little or no understanding of the subject voicing opinions, which are not based on facts.
Firstly, we would like to point out that tobacco is a cash crop, which was introduced to farmers by the Sri Lankan Government in the 1950s and fully supported by successive Governments until very recently.
Under the patronage of previous Governments, tobacco cultivation has been an important part of the agrarian communities spanning 70 years and three farmer generations.
Currently, there are more than 20,000 farmers growing cigarette tobacco using less than 0.01% of the countrys arable land.
These farmers depend on tobacco cultivation to earn a living while more than 300,000 livelihoods are dependent on this crop and its value chain.
Tobacco cultivation infuses over Rs. 1.5 billion to the rural economy annually.
In addition to that, it (Tobacco cultivation) compels farmers to use child labour...
As the All Island Cigarette Tobacco Barn Owners Association representing over 20,000 cigarette tobacco farmers in Sri Lanka, we vehemently deny this as false.
We ensure our farmers are educated and aware of Ceylon Tobacco Companys (CTCs) strict policy of not using child labour in tobacco growing.

The attempt made by Dr Mahesh Rajasuriya to tarnish the image of tobacco farmers and tobacco farming in Sri Lanka is a good example of people with little or no understanding of the subject voicing opinions, which are not basedon facts.

In fact, this is a clause included in the contract that is signed between the farmers and the company. We can confidently say that there have been no reported cases of child labour in cigarette tobacco farming in Sri Lanka.
It is sad that Dr. Rajasuriya has made a general statement accusing tobacco farmers in Sri Lanka of using child labour without looking at the reality or speaking to farmers to understand the situation.
Furthermore, tobacco is not a magical crop as it is portrayed in media and promotional campaigns. It is labour-intensive, weather dependent and can be harmed by wild animals, it involves a high initial investment and is not profitable as it is portrayed to be.
As Dr Rajasuriya, points out, tobacco is a labour-intensive crop. Growing tobacco requires between 320 to 340 man-days per hectare. This means tobacco provides direct employment to many people living in rural areas who would otherwise have no way to earn a living. We must also point out that tobacco cultivation generates indirect employment for many people. All in all, we look at the labour intensity that Dr Rajasuriya speaks of as a positive thing.
Moreover, as in the case with all other agricultural crops tobacco is also weather dependent and like paddy, sugar cane and coconut, tobacco is also attacked by wild animals. However, through experience we know that it is a more resilient crop and can survive even in harsh conditions.

Tobacco cultivation generates indirect employment for many people. All in all, we look at the labour intensity that Dr Rajasuriya speaks of as a positive thing.

Tobacco requires only 1/7th of the water required to grow paddy making it an ideal crop for the dry zones in Sri Lanka. This and the fact that tobacco is a guaranteed source of income are reasons why many farmers have continued to grow it despite being harassed by certain government authorities and anti-tobacco NGOs.
In many developing countries wood is used as a fuel to cure tobacco leaves and to construct curing barns
Here is an example of the anti-tobacco lobby using false information to mislead the public about tobacco cultivation. We say with complete confidence that in Sri Lanka cigarette tobacco curing is carried out using paddy husk only. Paddy husk is a waste material that is available in many agricultural areas and our farmers shifted to the use of paddy husk during the 90s.
In fact, Sri Lanka was one of the first countries in the world to eliminate the use of wood for tobacco curing. Furthermore, 100% of the tobacco barns are automated and even the paddy husk is used in a more efficient manner. This technology was developed locally by one of our own farmers. Instead of recognizing these facts and achievements, we find it sad that, anti-tobacco groups keep levelling baseless accusations at us.
It has also been found that tobacco cultivation involves a lot of pesticides, which need to be used in all stages of tobacco growth. Tobacco depletes soil nutrients at a higher rate and requires regular input of chemical fertilizers.
This is yet another statement that is not applicable in the Sri Lankan context. Tobacco farmers adopt integrated pest management systems to control pests. Furthermore, CTC helps farmers by testing the soil and recommending of site-specific fertilizers based on soil mapping.
Recently the University of Peradeniya also conducted a study to test the soil quality in tobacco lands. This study found that tobacco had no adverse impact on soil fertility. This can be further proven by the fact that we use the same lands to cultivate paddy during the Maha season.
Cultivating tobacco affects the quality of life of farmers and their families. It affects their health and well-being. It causes exhaustion and stress, induces wheezing and other respiratory diseases such as the green tobacco sickness.
The green tobacco disease has been identified by CTC as a potential risk to tobacco farmers if it is not managed properly. It is not a secret, and in fact, the company talks about this risk openly and works very closely with our association to educate farmers in Sri Lanka on precautionary measures to follow. We have introduced simple yet effective methods to ensure the farmers are not impacted. We invite anyone interested to visit the tobacco growing areas and speak to tobacco farmers before making claims without any backing.
Furthermore, exhaustion and stress are part and parcel of any farmers life and anyone who understands anything about farming and agriculture will know this. Farmers in Sri Lanka exert a lot of effort not just to grow their crops but also to sell the harvest at the end of the season.
Material on credit and forward buying approaches of the CTC engage the farmers in a viscous cycle of tobacco cultivation, which leads to many negative effects as explained earlier. The main pitfall is farmers being blind-folded to measure economic gain based on the amount of money received at one time rather than the calculation of actual profit when accounted for all the costs including the cost of labour of the farmer and his family members.
Cigarette tobacco farmers are the only farmers in the country who receive support and security through the forward contract system that is followed by CTC. This means that unlike farmers of other crops, we are guaranteed the purchase of the full crop grown at a pre-agreed, competitive price. We find it disturbing that Dr Rajasuriya feels this is pitfall and a vicious cycle. We would like to inquire from him if a sustainable income and a guaranteed sale of crop are signs of being stuck in a vicious cycle.

Don't ban pandals on Vesak, Poson Poya Days: Wimal
	
The National Freedom Front (NFF) today urged the government to withdraw its decision to prohibit pandals on Vesak and Poson Poya Days without underestimating the Buddhists in the country and claimed it was an unwise decision.
The government yesterday decided to prohibit pandals on Vesak and Poson Poya Days to stress the need to focus on the spiritual aspect of religion rather than on mundane activities.
NFF leader and MP Wimal Weerawansa said the erecting of pandals was not inappropriate on Vesak and Poson Poya Days because it was one of the main ways to convey the meaning of religion to people especially for children.
Buddhists usually engage in religious and spiritual activities in the daytime on Vesak and Poson Poya Days and visit Pandals in the night. Nobody has requested to prohibit pandals on these Poya Days though requests have been made to prohibit private tuition classes on Sunday mornings to allow students attend Sunday schools, he said.
Mr. Weerawansa said the government was attempting to undermine Buddhist culture and asked on what basis the government was prohibiting pandals on these Poya Days despite the same government constructing the tallest artificial Christmas tree though it was disapproved by Colombo's Archbishop Malcolm Cardinal Ranjith.

Mrs. Sylvia Weerasinghe Enormous void left by your absence
	
The weight of this sad time we must obey, speak what we feel, not what we ought to say. The oldest hath borne most. We that are here shall never see so much nor live so long.  William Shakespeare.
I am feeling the enormous void left by your absence. I am going to miss you so badly. You were more like a mother than a friend to Hillary and me. We were so blessed to have you in our lives. I will remember all the prayers you have sent up to Heaven for us, those wake up calls to check after a court hearing, because a squatter illegally occupies our home.
We remember all the special and vivid memories, images of our Sunday evenings at Calvary Church, when we looked forward to attending services and meeting you. We can never forget your visiting us in Oman, the happiness of having you in our home, and of those meetings where the expatriate Christian community in that part of the world, were blessed to meet you and hear the Word of God.
During that time our spiritual life too changed, hearing you sending up prayers and praises to Heaven at early dawn. All this is in the prism of our memory. Those were the shiniest images from the stream of time that we have of you, beloved Aunty Sylvia.
Your constant communication, reassuring care and concern has touched the core of many for sure. The walls of our hearts will always hold safe the love and caring you had for Hillary and me.
You always reminded us of faith, that no matter what, even if life turns cold at times that Gods love and tenderness will pull us up through the roughest of waters. Your beloved children and family have inherited the same esteemed love you have for God which accompanied you in every step and in every path of your life.
You lived in the light of your faith and your values. Many will speak of you and share their thoughts of your remarkable and unshakable faith in God.
How can we forget that smile of yours, which always meant so much to those who met you, that smile that will never be frozen, beaming now in the marvellous splendour of Heaven.
We here, on earth, will always love you, and miss you so very much.

The statement said there was no barrier for any citizen to do so as he wishes in view of Vesak. The statement said Subject Minister Gamini Jayawickrama Perera only stressed the point that it would be appropriate for devotees to focus on Pratipatti Pooja instead of Amisa Pooja on Poya Day.

No-faith motion: Wijeyadasa still undecided
	
MP Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe said yesterday he had still not decided on whether to support the no-confidence motion and underscored the fact that the MPs should evaluate the outcome of the no-confidence motion before voting for or against it.
He said MPs should look at who was going to be appointed as the next Prime Minister and how the situation would benefit the people in the event the no-confidence motion was successful.
The country is facing many obstacles today in several sectors including agriculture and economy. The stock market has collapsed, investors are discouraged and we have become a failure in the eyes of the international community. This should be changed. We cant afford to make things worse following the results of the motion, the MP said.
He said if the United National Party (UNP) decided to defeat the no-faith motion, it should plan out the changes it would bring to do things better.
The MP said people were not concerned about the party from which a Premier would be appointed but about how future plans and policies would benefit them.
What people want are policies and implementing them. What matters as of now is about what comes after the no-faith motion. Im still open and will make a decision after evaluating the developments in the coming days, he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

ISLAMABAD AFP March30, 2018- Malala Yousafzais whereabouts in Pakistan were being kept a tightly-guarded secret Friday, one day after her emotional return more than five years after being shot byTaliban gunmen. 
But with intense criticism among the many messages of welcome, her itinerary was being kept under wraps over security fears, with even those meeting her not being told of her presence until the last moment.  Womens rights activist Nighat Dad said that she and a group of other feminists from across Pakistan who were gathered on Thursday were not told they would be meeting Malala until the last moment.  The organiser, Oscar-winning director Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy, only told them Itll be the highlight of your year, Dad said -- adding that she had been right.

Party reforms soon after defeating no-faith motion: UNP
	
The United National Party (UNP) said yesterday it would carry out rigorous party reforms no sooner it defeated the no-confidence motion against UNP Leader and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe in Parliament.
MP Kavinda Jayawardena told a news conference held at Sirikotha that they were confident of defeating the no-confidence motion on April 4 and launch its reforms on April 5.
At the Working Committee meeting held on Thursday, the party decided to support the Premier and defeat the no-confidence motion. We also decided to reform the party. Three committees each headed by Ministers Sajith Premadasa, Ruwan Wijewardene and Deputy Minister J. C. Alawathuwala were appointed to submit proposals for party reforms. Two of the committees had handed over their reports to the party leader, he said.
When asked whether there will be a change in the UNP leadership when the party undergoes reforms, Mr. Jayawardena said the specifics would be decided by the party at its convention.
Meanwhile, he said government members including the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) ministers should resign from the government if they supported the motion which would be defeated.

The first batch of nine restored Romanian compartments will be put on track this morning on a special train from Colombo Fort to Ragama, Railways General Manager Mahanama Abeywickrama said.
The first batch of the completed compartments will be put on track to Ragama today under the patronage of Transport Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva and the Deputy Minister Ashoka Abeysinghe, he said. A total of 200 compartments are being repaired and restored under a joint project between a private company and the Railways Department.
Mr. Abeywickrama said the Romanian coaches were imported between 1990 and 1992 and that most of the coaches were more than 26 years old with many passengers complaining to the Railways Department that they were not suitable for travelling. The important parts of a compartment are the technical parts such as the braking system, which is more important for the safety of the commuters. Only the technical parts of a compartment are handled by the Railways Department technicians, he said. Each compartment is being repaired at a cost of Rs.10 to 15 million."

SL makes its best contributions to intl community- Aryasinha
	
Permanent Representative of Sri Lanka to UN in Geneva, Ambassador Ravinatha Aryasinha has said Sri Lanka makes its best contributions to the international community when it leads from the centre, rather than positioning itself in a manner "either to be taken for granted, or to remain isolated.
The Ambassador who relinquishes his tour of duty as Sri Lanka's Permanent Representative to the UN in Geneva this week, made this observation in his farewell address to the Conference on Disarmament (CD), where last month under Sri Lanka's Presidency, the Conference unanimously adopted Decision CD/2119 setting up 5 subsidiary bodies to commence substantive work. Addressing the High-Level Segment of the CD, UN Secretary-General Antnio Guterres welcoming this Decision stated, I believe you are off to the best start in nearly two decades, and I look forward to building on this new momentum.
Recalling that for long years Sri Lanka had been an active player in the field of disarmament, Ambassador Aryasinha expressed satisfaction that Sri Lanka was once again able to make a meaningful contribution through CD/2119, during its recent Presidency. He said the decision "was a balance between flexibility and safeguards, and it offered a framework for a more focused and continued debate on all core issues on the CD agenda. I believe this has the potential of being an irreversible first step in getting the CD back to work, and in asserting its credibility as the single multilateral forum for negotiating disarmament treaties," Permanent Mission of Sri Lanka to UN in Geneva said quoting Mr. Aryasinha.
Referring to the dynamics that resulted in this CD Decision, he believed that "the cardinal principles upheld in arriving at CD/2119; inclusiveness in consultations, transparency in engagement without a pre-conceived agenda, and allowing adequate time to deal with the genuine security concerns of all Member States, will undoubtedly help as we move through the next steps of operationalizing this decision and bringing the Conference back to negotiations".
Noting that the CD's "rule of consensus has not been the reason for the CDs stalemate, but it is the lack of political will", and that "clearly the issue is not procedural, but political", Ambassador Aryasinha said countries would be better served " if we use the rule of consensus, as a tool for compromise, rather than as a veto".
Emphasizing the significance that following the adoption of CD/2119, delegations who had continued to show scepticism about the CD process in the past, had expressing their willingness to work constructively towards realization of the its goals in order to get the CD back to work, he cautioned that CD members must be conscious that unless this window of opportunity is seized on, the momentum could be lost.
In conclusion, while ccongratulating the current President of the CD Switzerland for confirming the appointment of 5 coordinators on the principle of equitable geographical representation as stipulated in the February decision and a schedule of meetings based on equitable time, Ambassador Aryasinha remarked, "eventuality, whether CD/2119 was a beginning or an aberration remains to be seen. But one thing is certain. The cost of standing in the way of the CD moving forward has become greater.

SL Navy refloats World War II British Ship
	
The wreck of one of the famous ships of Her Majestys Naval Service - SS Sagaing which sank at the Trincomalee harbour during the World War II, is refloated after 75 years stay underwater by a team of divers of Sri Lanka Navy making a landmark turning point in the field of Diving and Salvage, the Navy said.
This 138 m long Passenger cum Cargo Ship launched in 24thDecember 1924 was hit by Japanese carrier air craft bomber attacks whilst at anchorage in Trincomalee harbour on 09th April 1942 and subsequently abandoned due to escalating fire onboard. On 24thAugust 1943, the damaged ship had been sunken to be used as a pier for Naval Ships.
Sri Lanka Navy resorted to refloat the wreck which was fully submerged 35 feet under the sea in order to make sea room for expanding berthing facilities in the harbour. The task of salvaging and removing the ship wreck was assigned to Eastern Naval Command and it was undertaken by the Eastern Command Diving Unit headed by the Command Diving Officer (E), Captain (CDO) Krishantha Athukorala on 11th September 2017.
Then a comprehensive salvage plan made by CDO (E) was launched by a team of divers supervised by CPO (DIV) ALNSS Liyanage through patching up all damages and strengthening up deteriorated ships structural parts by erecting an artificial ship side in to the sunken wreck for dewatering ships internal volume to recover lost buoyancy. After a series of dedicated endeavour made along a period of five months, on 22nd March the wreck started to ascent to the surface proving the professionalism and instinct of SLN Divers.
The operation was assisted by LCdr Sathishka Pathirana and LCdr Shiran Buddhika along with 98 diving sailors permanently deployed to the project. Timely support, by the Operations, Logistics, Engineering, Electrical, Shipwright and Medical Departments and the continuous advices received from Director General Operations were highly affected in this successful endeavour. The entire proceedings of the wreck refloating effort were orchestrated under the able guidance of Commander of the Navy, Vice Admiral Sirimevan Ranasinghe.

TNA captures Jaffna Mayoralty through skilful political manoeuvre
	

Recently concluded elections to local authorities in February saw the municipal elections in Jaffna assuming great political significance.
Sumanthiran suggested that each entity, which came first in a particular local body be allowed to elect the Mayor or Chairperson and form the administration in a spirit of mutual respect
As is usual in contemporary Tamil politics there was a hitch in the form of a nay-sayer.

By
D.B.S. Jeyaraj
Jaffna is the capital city of the predominantly Tamil speaking Northern Province of Sri Lanka. It was at the time of independence from Britain, the second largest city in the Island, next only to Colombo.
Jaffna gradually declined in the post-independence years, dropping to fourth place at the 1981 census. Thereafter with the escalation of the ethnic conflict, Jaffna along with many other places in the Northern and Eastern Provinces got drastically affected by the war.
Disruption of the economy and mass migration saw Jaffna drop to 14th place when an Islandwide census was taken in 2012.
In fact, there are more Sri Lankan Tamils living in Colombo, London and Toronto than in Jaffna now. Nevertheless, Jaffna -known as Yaarlpaanam in Tamil and Yahapanaya in Sinhala- continues to retain its glory as the cultural capital of the Sri Lankan Tamils.
In that context, the recently concluded elections to local authorities in February saw the municipal elections in Jaffna assuming great political significance.
Winning the Jaffna municipal poll and electing its candidate as Mayor became a prestigious political party battle. Seven political parties or groupings were in the race for the Jaffna Municipal stakes comprising 45 seats (27 wards and 18 PR.)
The contenders were the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) contesting under the Ilankai Thamil Arasuk Katchi (ITAK) symbol of the house. The TNA comprises the ITAK, PLOTE and TELO; the Tamil National Peoples Front (TNPF) contesting under the Ahila Ilangai Tamil Congress (AITC) symbol of cycle; the Eelam Peoples Revolutionary Liberation Front (EPRLF) contesting under the Tamil United Liberation Front (TULF) symbol of sun along with the TULF; the Eelam Peoples Democratic Party (EPDP); the United National Party (UNP); the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) and the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna(JVP).
There were 56, 245 registered electors of whom 40,916 voted at the polls. With 586 votes being rejected, 40,330 votes were counted as valid. The ITAK polled the highest 14,424 (35.76%) and were entitled to 16 seats. The AITC coming next polled 12,020 (29.08%) and obtained 13 seats.
The EPDP came third polling 8,671 (21.05%) and getting 10 seats. The UNP garnering 2,423 (6.01%) had three seats. The SLFP with 1,479 (3.67%) got two seats. The TULF got one seat polling 1,071(2.66%). The JVP having only 242 (0.6%) votes did not get any seats.
With the fragmentation of seats among the different political parties, the end result was that of a hung council in Jaffna.

Arnold too modelled himself on Senathirajah, known as Maavai and adopted the ITAK leaders way of public speaking thus earning the sobriquet Sinna Maavai or Little Maavai.

This situation, however, was not in Jaffna alone but also prevalent in a very large number of local authorities all over the Island. This was mainly due to the new voting system, which was reportedly a mixture of the First Past the Post (FPP) winner mode and the Proportionate Representation (PR) method.
As a result in many instances, the situation was one where the party that came first found itself outnumbered by the other parties and being unable to form a viable administration in spite of gaining more votes and winning more directly contested wards.
The overhanging factor was the cause in most cases. The TNA consisting of the ITAK, PLOTE and TELO suffered greatly as a result of this syndrome. The TNA had contested 55 local authorities in the North and East. Of these 48 were Tamil majority local bodies. The TNA came first in 40 of these local authorities. However, the TNA found itself unable to form a viable administration in over 30 of these bodies including the prestigious Jaffna Municipality.

Vaazhu, Vaazhavidu(Live and Let Live)
The TNA leadership after internal discussions devised a Vaazhu, Vaazhavidu (Live and Let Live) policy to resolve this deadlock. It was left to the TNA and ITAK spokesperson Mathiaparanan Abraham Sumanthiran, MP to express this formula publicly.
Pointing out that parties and independent groups other than the TNA had also come first with the most number of seats in some urban councils and Pradeshiya Sabhas and were facing a hung situation,
Sumanthiran suggested that each entity, which came first in a particular local body be allowed to elect the Mayor or Chairperson and form the administration in a spirit of mutual respect and tolerance without hindrance from the other parties.
While acknowledging the fact that this policy, if accepted by all concerned, would help the TNA immensely in being able to form the administration in over 30 bodies including Jaffna, Sumanthiran also pointed out that it would also help the parties in a leading position in other local authorities.
The Jaffna District TNA Parliamentarian said that others like the EPDP and AITC in Jaffna, an independent group in Kilinochchi, the Tamil Makkal Viduthalaip Puligal (TMVP) in Batticaloa would also benefit from such an arrangement.
We will take over in the councils and Sabhas/Sabais where we came first, you all take over in councils and Sabhas/Sabhais where you came first. We will support you without blocking you or trying to undermine you. You support us without trying to obstruct or undercut us. Let us all run efficient local administrations and serve the people who elected us was the message. This was strongly endorsed by ITAK President and veteran Jaffna MP Somasundaram Maavai Senathirajah.
The ideas propounded by the TNA/ITAK resonated well with the people at large. After all the voters who elected their representatives would like to taste the fruits of their franchise rather than languish indefinitely in a state of uncertainty.
But as is usual in contemporary Tamil politics there was a hitch in the form of a nay-sayer. This was none other than the Nawab of Negativity Gajendrakumar Gangaesar Ponnambalam popularly known as Gajen Ponnambalam.
Despite his educational qualifications and political pedigree, the leader of the AITC/TNPF has never been known for pragmatism or flexibility in politics.
Besides his party that had been virtually written off at the 2015 Parliamentary poll had made a commendable comeback by performing well at the 2018 local polls. Gajen Ponnambalam regarded as the Darling of the Tamil Diaspora Hardliners was cock-a-hoop after the local polls.
So, Gajendrakumar Ponnambalam, who had perhaps overestimated his political clout, rejected the olive branch held out by the TNA.
Not only would the AITC/TNPF form the administration in the Point Pedro and Chavakachcheri Urban Councils where his party had come first, but he would also capture power in some local bodies, where the TNA had come first, said Ponnambalam.
Tamil media reports stated that Gajendrakumar Ponnambalam had specifically referred to the Jaffna Municipal Council, the Valvettithurai Urban Council, the Vadamaratchy South -West and Nallur Pradeshiya Sabhas in this respect.
The AITC/TNPF leader seemed very optimistic in his being able to ascend the Jaffna Municipal throne despite the TNA being in the lead there.
It soon became apparent that Gajen Ponnambalam had set his sights on Jaffna and was seemingly sure of gaining control there in spite of his party having only 13 of 45 seats in the council.
On the one hand, there was a personal element in this mindset as Gajens grandfather GG Ponnambalam Snr had been the Jaffna MP from 1947 to 1960 and 1965 to 1970.
The Tamil Congress had been a force to be reckoned with in the politics of Jaffna town for decades. This, however, had changed with the advent of Gajens father GG Ponnambalam Jnr. known generally as Kumar Ponnambalam. When Kumar Ponnambalam contested Jaffna in the 1977 Parliamentary poll as an independent under the tree symbol, he had lost badly to Vettivelu Yogeswaran of the TULF. After Kumar Ponnambalam took over the party, the Tamil Congress had fared poorly in the Jaffna Municipal poll of 1979 too.

Gajendrakumar Ponnambalams Grandiose Expectations
Apart from this Gajen Ponnambalam was confident of winning the Mayoral contest in Jaffna due to another reason too. As he himself boasted to supporters and well-wishers, Gajen expected a large number of municipal councillors from both the TNA and the EPDP to vote against the official TNA Mayoral candidate Emmanuel Arnold.
Ponnambalam was sure that several MMCs from these two parties would vote for the TNPF nominee Visuvalingam Manivannan.
He also demanded that the voting should be by secret ballot to facilitate this potential cross-party voting. In order to understand why Gajendrakumar Ponnamblam had such grandiose expectations, it is importantly necessary to delve briefly into the political environment that prevailed in Jaffna before the local authority poll of February 10, 2018.
When the local authority elections loomed large on the political horizon last year, there were internal convulsions within the Tamil National Alliance, which is the premier political configuration of the Sri Lankan Tamils. One of the TNA constituents the EPRLF charged the ITAK of dominating the TNA and pulled out of the grouping.
The remaining PLOTE and TELO also engaged in some squabbling with the ITAK, which is the largest and key constituent of the TNA.
After some bickering and grandstanding, the ITAK, PLOTE and TELO agreed upon a formula to contest local polls.
There were 48 local authorities with a clear Tamil majority in the North and East. It was decided that the ITAK would be given pride of place in 32 while the TELO and PLOTE would get 12 and 4 respectively.
According to this arrangement, the Mayor/Chairperson positions and 60% of candidates would be given to one party while the Deputy -Mayor/Deputy Chairman Posts and 20 % of candidates would be given to each of the other two parties. TNA candidates were selected and confirmed on these lines.
The Jaffna Municipal Council was the jewel in the crown for the TNA. Candidates were selected on the sharing formula agreed upon. The ITAK picked Emmanuel Arnold as its Mayoral candidate. The TELO selected Thurairasa Eesan as its nominee for Deputy Mayor.
Emmanuel Arnold hailing from Paashaiyoor in Jaffna is an old student of St. Johns College Jaffna. He graduated from the Jaffna University with a BA degree specializing in economics.
Arnold is a devout Catholic and does not belong to the Protestant Christian Arnold families of Jaffna.
Actually, his fathers name is Emmanuel but instead of going by that surname the son prefers being called Emmanuel Arnold. After graduating, Emmanuel Arnold joined Janashakthi Insurance and rose up from the ranks to become Regional Sales Manager for the North.
Arnold was a politically active youth with a social conscience. He had excelled in sports particularly soccer as a student. It is said that he may have played soccer at a national level but for the ethnic conflict, which devoured the youthful days of many Tamils including Arnold.
He was very popular as an undergrad and was president of the Jaffna University Students Union.
Arnold who is a powerful orator organized many student protests and demonstrations at the Jaffna Varsity during his undergraduate days. He was once photographed giving a clenched fist salute at a political event and detained at Boosa as an LTTE suspect. He was cleared of all suspicion after being interrogated intermittently for six months and released with a clean sheet.

Sobriquet Sinna Maavai Or Little Maavai
Arnold, who is married with children, involved himself with the youth wing of the ITAK after the war ended in 2009.
Maavai Senathirajah, who was the General-Secretary of the ITAK, took a liking to the energetic and enterprising young man with a pleasant countenance and an amiable disposition.
Arnold too modelled himself on Senathirajah, known as Maavai and adopted the ITAK leaders way of public speaking thus earning the sobriquet Sinna Maavai or Little Maavai.
Sinna Maavai Arnold was picked as an ITAK candidate by Maavai Senathirajah for the first ever Northern Provincial Council (NPC) elections in 2013. Arnold, polling 26,888 got the sixth highest number of preference votes on the TNA list. The five, who polled higher than Arnold were CV Wigneswaran, Ananthy Sasitharan, Dharmalingam Siddharthan, P. Ariyaratnam and B. Gajatheeban.
After the NPC started functioning Arnold was deputed to assist Provincial Education Minister T. Kurukularajah, who delegated sports and youth affairs to the young man from Paashaiyoor.
Being a keen sportsman himself Arnold took up his unofficial duties diligently and re-vitalised sports and athletics in schools.
He also organized several tournaments for youths in the North in general and Jaffna in particular. Arnold became quite popular among youths and students as a result of this.
Meanwhile, Lawyer M. A. Sumanthiran who was appointed National List MP by the TNA in 2010 was assigned the task of identifying and cultivating a younger set of potential leaders within the NPC by TNA leader Rajavarothayam Sampanthan and deputy leader Maavai Senathirajah.
Sumanthiran picked a few NPC councillors and began working politically with them. Chief among these was a trio, comprising members of the Hindu, Christian and Islamic faiths respectively.
They were Kesavan Sayanthan (Hindu), Emmanuel Arnold (Christian) and Ayub Asmin (Muslim).
Subsequently, Sumanthiran himself contested in Jaffna during the 2015 Parliamentary poll. A vicious campaign financed by LTTE and pro-LTTE elements in the Diaspora was launched against Sumanthiran within and outside TNA folds.
The Sayanthan-Arnold - Asmin trinity was greatly instrumental in leading the election campaign on behalf of Sumanthiran, who won comfortably in 2015 while his open and furtive adversaries lost very badly.

The Sayanthan-Arnold - Asmin trinity was greatly instrumental in leading the election campaign on behalf of Sumanthiran, who won comfortably in 2015...

There was an open revolt in 2017 within TNA councillors in the NPC against Chief Minister Wigneswaran who was accused of political double -games by his detractors who formulated a No-Confidence Motion against the ex-judge.
The ensuing hullabaloo culminated with the exit of Education Minister Kurukularajah. Acting on the outgoing Provincial Ministers recommendation the ITAK nominated Emmanuel Arnold to be Education Minister.
But C.V. Wigneswaran, who had his own agenda appointed Ananthy Sasitharan instead.
It was believed then that Wigneswaran was hostile towards Arnold because the latter had played a key role in the attempt to oust the controversial Chief Minister.

Triple S - Sampanthan, Senathirajah and Sumanthiran
When elections to local authorities became imminent the Triple S of the ITAK, namely Sampanthan, Senathirajah and Sumanthiran, finalised the selection of candidates for the polls.
Emmanuel Arnold though a Provincial Councillor was picked as the Mayoral candidate for Jaffna. Arnold resigned his Northern Provincial Councillor post on December 14th, 2017.
It was obvious that he was doing so because he hoped to become the Jaffna Mayor. This, however, was not to the liking of many within the TNA as well as outside it.
One of the main reasons for this antipathy towards Arnold was the perception among anti- Sumanthiran elements that the prospective Mayoral candidate was a protege of Sumanthiran.
It was felt that Arnold becoming Mayor would strengthen Sumanthiran further politically.
There were other reasons too. One of the positive points of the long Tamil struggle for equality has been its secular nature. This enabled a large number of Christians to find common cause with their Hindu brethren in the quest for Tamil emancipation.
It was this ethos of secular nationalism which made possible a Protestant Christian like Samuel James Veluppillai Chelvananayagam to remain the acknowledged leader of pre-dominantly Hindu Tamils for decades until his death. Even the armed militant organizations were essentially secular in composition and outlook. All this, however, has been slowly changing in recent times after the war ended in 2009.
A process of creeping soft Hindutva is beginning to emerge among Sri Lankan Tamils.
It is suspected that it is being ideologically inspired and financially backed up by elements connected to the Hindu Ultra-right wing Parivar (family) in India.
Fortunately, it is yet to take root in Sri Lanka but covert attempts are going on.
One such manifestation has been the phenomenon of leaflets and posters urging Hindus not to patronise non-Hindu businesses or vote for non-Hindus. Obviously, the targets are Muslim businessmen and Christian politicians.
So, when Arnold was tipped to be the Mayoral candidate such anti-Christian, pro- Hindu sentiments were mella, mella (slowly, slowly) propagated in Jaffna.
One of those in the forefront of the anti-Arnold camp was a prominent member of the Northern Provincial Council.
This self-styled scholar of Saivaite wisdom is like Northern Chief Minister Wigneswaran, a disciple of Swami Premananda. Premananda was convicted of rape and murder by an Indian court in 1997.
This person kept ranting and raving that a Christian from a particular caste could not become the Mayor of Jaffna, which was a Siva Bhoomi (Lord Shivas ground).
If this gentleman seemingly steeped in Saivaite wisdom objected to Arnold on a caste and religious basis another line of the opposition took a different approach.

Ex-Parliamentarian Solomon Cyril for Mayor
A Parliamentarian elected from the Jaffna District proposed the name of ex -Parliamentarian Solomon Cyril as Mayor instead of Emmanuel Arnold.
Both Cyril and Arnold were Catholics and shared a common socio-cultural heritage. But Cyril, who was involved in trade union activity earlier had been made an MP by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) when the LTTE was ruling the roost in the north and exerting great control over the TNA.
So, the argument in favour of Cyril was that he had been a personal favourite of LTTE Supremo Veluppillai Prabhakaran and therefore was more suitable than Arnold to be Mayor.
The Jaffna MP in question was against Arnold because of the latters perceived links to Sumanthiran. Not that he loved Arnold less but he hated Sumanthiran more!
All these happenings resulted in the extra -careful Senathirajah soft-pedalling the issue for a while.
Senathirajah hailing from Chelvanayagams Kankesanthurai constituency is an avowed secularist and federalist.
Although a firebrand in his youthful days septuagenarian Senathirajah has mellowed with age and experience.
So he is quite cautious in politics nowadays. Due to this cautious approach, Senathirajah was delaying the official announcement about Arnold being the Mayoral candidate.
At least three events scheduled to officially announce the candidature of Arnold were postponed. This diminished Arnolds chances of victory and strengthened the hands of his opponents. It was at this point that Sumanthiran who was the accredited TNA spokesperson jumped the long-delayed gun and formally announced Emmanuel Arnold as the Jaffna Mayoral candidate. This caused quite a lot of excitement and further reinforced the belief that Arnold was a protege of Sumanthiran. The announcement, however, removed all doubts and settled the Mayor Matter once and for all.
The election campaign got underway and polls were held on February 10.
The results as stated earlier brought about a hung Municipal Council.
The TNA came first with 16 out of 45 seats but was unable to get Arnold elected as Mayor.
Among many reasons attributed to the TNAs - not up to the mark - performance in the Jaffna municipal poll was the suspicion of sabotage.
One example being the wards from a particular locality assigned for election work to the NPC member, who opposed Arnold on religious grounds.
Out of nine wards assigned to this individual, the TNA lost in six. Was it a mere coincidence or was there more to it than which meets the eye
It was against this backdrop therefore that the TNPF was gloating of certain victory at the Mayoral election and demanding secret voting. It was believed or suspected that the anti-Arnold elements within the TNA would persuade at least ten TNA municipal councillors to vote for the Hindu candidate from the TNPF/AITC as opposed to the TNAs Emmanuel Arnold. Interestingly the third candidate in the fray Mudiappu Remedius from the EPDP was also like Arnold -a Catholic from Paashaiyoor.
Realising that the challenge to Arnold should not be taken lightly, the TNA leadership took two important steps.
The first was to impress upon all elected TNA councillors that party discipline was important and that the official nominee should be supported at all cost. They were warned that any breach of discipline in the form of cross-party voting would be sternly dealt with resulting in loss of council membership.

Maavai Senathirajah Telephoned Douglas Devananda
The second step was to renew TNA efforts to win over the other political parties to practise the policy of letting each party that came first in a council or Pradeshiya Sabha to be the head of each body and form an administration.
So, the Jaffna traders association was asked to talk to the TNPF/Tamil Congress again. The TNA also approached the EPDP. A TELO delegation led by Mannar MP Selvam Adaikkalanathan met EPDP Secretary-General Douglas Devananda in Colombo.
This was followed up by ITAK President Maavai Senathirajah who telephoned Devananda and re-iterated that each party be allowed to form an administration in the local body it had come first in.
TNA spokesperson Sumanthiran MP who had already discussed the issue with the EPDPs designated Mayoral candidate Remedius at an event held to celebrate the 50th anniversary of being called to the bar of veteran lawyer Murugesu Sittampalam (half-brother of TULF leader Murugesu Sivasithamparam) communicated with Remedius again.
While the Tamil Congress/AITC rejected the Live and let live invitation outright the EPDP emitted positive signals while remaining basically non - committal.
D-day was on March 26th, 2018. Forty - four of the forty-five Jaffna Municipal Councillors gathered at the municipal premises. The councillor elected on the TULF ticket had been convicted for an offence under the penal code and was absent.
The Municipal Commissioner M. Patrick Niranjan presided at the election. Visvalingam Manivannan from AITC, Mudiappu Remedius from EPDP and Emmanuel Arnold of the ITAK were the contestants in the fray.
In a symbolic gesture demonstrating that the TNA had closed ranks, it was mayoral aspirant Solomon Cyril who proposed Arnolds name. Likewise, former EPDP Jaffna mayor Yogeswari Patkunarajah proposed Remedius as a candidate.
An ebulliently confident Manivannan asked for secret voting while Arnold wanted open voting. The decision about mode of voting was put to the vote.
The 16 TNA and three UNP councillors wanted open voting while the 13 AITC, 10 EPDP and two SLFP councillors wanted secret voting.
So secret voting was adopted. When the first round of voting was conducted Arnold came first with 18 votes, while Manivannan and Remedius tied with 13 votes each.
Thereafter the names of Remedius and Manivannan were written on pieces of paper and one slip was picked.
Remedius was lucky and Manivannan exited the contest.
Now it was going to be a straight fight between Arnold and Remedius. The EPDP candidate then asked for a recess of 20 minutes which was granted by Commissioner Patrick Niranjan.
Mudiappu Remedius was then seen conversing animatedly with Manivannan and thereafter was seen to be engaged in a prolonged telephone conversation.
When it was time again to resume voting the lawyer Mudiappu Remedius dropped a bombshell. He stated that he was withdrawing from the Mayoral race and went up to Arnold and shook his hands congratulating him.

There were 48 local authorities with a clear Tamil majority in the North and East. It was decided that the ITAK would be given pride of place in 32 while the TELO and PLOTE would get 12 and 4 respectively.

At this juncture the Tamil congresss Visuvalingam Manivannan, also a lawyer requested that he be allowed to contest against Arnold because Remedius had withdrawn.
Patrick Niranjan, however, said that the election rules did not permit it. Manivannan, therefore, recorded his protest at the decision. Emmanuel Arnold was then announced to be the Mayor.
The announcement was received enthusiastically by TNA, UNP and even EPDP members applauding loudly. TNA Parliamentarians Senathirajah and Sumanthiran along with some Provincial Councillors were present and congratulated a jubilant Arnold.
The new Mayor then retired to chambers donned the crimson cloak and presided over the next session, in which Thurairasa Eeasan was elected Deputy -Mayor unopposed.

New Mayor Of Jaffna Emmanuel Arnold
A triumphant Emmanuel Arnold then thanked his fellow municipal councillors for electing him, Mayor.
He invited all councillors from the different parties to cooperate with him in making Jaffna a clean city and a green city. He also promised to safeguard the historical and archaeological heritage in Nallur.
Thereafter his worship the new Mayor of Jaffna paid visits to Hindu, Christian, Buddhist and Islamic religious leaders in Jaffna and received their blessings and wishes.
Thus ended the long saga of Jaffnas Mayoral Election. The TNA has succeeded in capturing the Jaffna mayoralty through deft political manoeuvring and get its nominee Emmanuel Arnold elected as the 24th Mayor of Jaffna. (ENDS)

Turkey rejects France offer for mediation with Kurdish militia
	
ISTANBUL AFP March30, 2018- Turkey on Friday turned down a French offer to mediate with the Syrian Democratic Forces dominated by a Kurdish militia deemed a terrorist outfit by Ankara, a presidential spokesman said.

We reject any efforts to promote dialogue, contact or mediation between Turkey and those terrorist organisations, Ibrahim Kalin wrote on Twitter. 
French President Emmanuel Macron on Thursday said he hoped a dialogue could be established between the two sides with help from Paris and the international community, after he met a delegation of Syrian and Arab fighters. The backbone of the SDF is the Kurdish Peoples Protection Units (YPG) militia which has been driven out of its Afrin stronghold by a Turkish offensive in northern Syria. The YPG is the military wing of the main Syrian Kurdish political movement, the Democratic Union Party (PYD).  The Turkish military began its offensive against the YPG in January.

Worlds biggest desert has expanded by more than 10% over last century
	

(Daily Mail), 29 March 2018 
Global warming is causing the Sahara desert to grow, new research suggests. 
Scientists have found that the worlds largest desert has expanded by more than ten per cent over the last 100 years. 
The study suggests the rest of the worlds deserts could be expanding too as widespread climate change continues to heat up the planet. 
Our results are specific to the Sahara, but they likely have implications for the worlds other deserts, said Sumant Nigam, a professor of atmosphericand oceanic science at the Universityof Maryland.

The researchers analysed seasonal rainfall data throughout Africa from 1920 to 2013. The team found that areas around the Sahara that were once non-desert regions could now be classified as deserts.
