AIA and Wayamba University congratulate Personal Financial Management Diploma graduates
	

AIA Insurance collaborated with the Wayamba University of Sri Lanka in successfully completing the Diploma in Personal Management for Wealth Planners and Wealth Planners Managers.
This was the first time such a programme for insurance agents was carried out in a local university. The 28 certificate recipients were trained under the guidance of an expert panel of lecturers from the Department of Accountancy and the Faculty of Business Studies and Finance of the Wayamba University. The Diploma programme was launched in 2015 with the objective of providing AIAs Wealth Planners with the knowledge and expertise to provide their clients with a superior service. The curriculum covers aspects of financial analysis, management principles, professional and personal development, economics, managing projects and legal aspects of business.
Wayamba University Vice Chancellor Prof. E.M.P Ekanayake stated in this regard: We took special effort to engage the highest quality of trainers and resources in ensuring a successful course that adds value to the Wealth Planners as well as their customers. We are proud of this first batch who took a leap into academics to better their careers and I have no doubt that they will put their learning to good use and shine in their future performance.
AIA Sri Lanka CEO Pankaj Banerjee added: I congratulate the qualified Wealth Planners and Wealth Planners Managers for their successful completion of the Diploma programme. At AIA, we pride ourselves in having the highest calibre of Wealth Planners and this programme is testament to our efforts to constantly raise the bar. We look forward to many more batches of this programme and strongly believe that the synergies between Asias leading insurer and one of Sri Lankas well respected universities can result in revolutionising the insurance industry and creating a new breed of agents.

Amana Takaful fulfills its promises in Galle
	

Amana Takaful Insurance, being the pioneer of the Takaful Insurance way has played a vital and revolutionary role in the Sri Lankan Insurance Industry during its 18 year presence.
Being in the forefront of innovation, Amana Takaful introduced two new insurance schemes namely, TukTuk Full and Smart Rider Cover eight months ago especially targeted to three wheeler and motor cycle insurance holders. Loaded with added benefits, this is another first by Amana Takaful, writing a new chapter in the Sri Lankan insurance industry.
This insurance scheme enables the policy holder to receive Rs.300,000 at the time of accidental death. Any accident repairs that result in an income loss entitles the insurance holder to a claim of up to Rs.1000 per day to a maximum of four days a year and in the case of any accident resulting in hospitalization, that leads to an income loss, this scheme entitles them to receive Rs.750 per day for a maximum of 10 days. Furthermore, in the case of a death of a family member of the primary insurance policy holder, the insurance scheme facilitates them to receive an amount of Rs.25,000, whilst coverage of Rs.100,000 is provided for 38 critical illnesses. Moreover, Rs.300,000 will be released at the time of permanent disability of policy holder.
Amana Takaful Life Galle Branch fulfilled these promises recently, where three of the policy holders qualifying under the scheme were granted these special benefits. It is of more significance that these benefits werent granted merely for unfortunate circumstances arising of vehicle accidents but for the damage and distress caused by natural disasters. Sriyani Pieris (SRC Insurance), Priyadashani Hettige (SRC Insurance) and M.H.N. Kariyawasam were the beneficiaries at this event.
Speaking at the event, Amana Takaful Insurance Chief Executive Officer Fazal Ghaffoor stated that Amana is always prepared and willing to give its customers the best and the most innovative insurance solutions and it has been the driving force behind their success for the last 18 years.
Addressing the gathering, Singer Finance Galle Branch Manager and few of the attendees stated that the introduction of such beneficial and valuable insurance schemes are indeed exemplary and encouraged the other insurance providers in the field to follow suit. He also expressed his gratitude to Amana Takaful Insurance for fulfilling the promises made to the community in a timely manner.
Amongst the August gathering were Amana Takaful Insurance CEO Fazal Ghaffoor, ATL Southern Zone Manager Janaka Wijekumara, Marketing Head Shammi Nishshanka, ATL Galle Manager Suluki Ibrahim and many staff members of the ATL Southern Province branches, representatives from many Finance companies in Galle, customers and many media representatives.

Bad water emerges as soft drink companies suck!
	
Engineers have suggested that villagers close thousands of cracks with mud
	Water covers 71% of the Earths surface. It is vital for all known forms of life
	Water in Udugampola, Minuwangoda, and Mirigama areas has been affected by tube wells
	Other countries in the world dont permit deep drilling activities like in Sri Lanka
	Residents of Kalutara and Galle have encountered a serious issue regarding drinking water
	Ground water aquifers in Heeloya area in Badulla have been damaged

The next world wars will be fought over water, experts have predicted. Many countries in the world are destined to fight over the limited sources available in the future. Since they are living in an island, Sri Lankans might never be in a situation where they will have to fight with other countries over water. But a matter to be concerned of is that Sri Lankans are incapable of managing their water resources wisely. This is because the islanders are selling their water to multinational companies and also engaging in deep drilling activities to obtain ground water, endlessly. Sri Lankas humanrights are violated by exporting water, because this activity deprives citizens of a basic need. 
Pope Francis has warned that we could be moving toward a major world war over water. The Pontiff made these comments when he addressed participants at the concluding session of an international seminar on the human right to water, held at the Vaticans Pontifical Academy of Sciences. 
In 2015, NASAs satellite data revealed that 21 of the worlds 37 large aquifers are severely water-stressed. With growing populations and increased demands from agriculture and industry, researchers indicated that this crisis could worsen. 
Water covers 71% of the Earths surface. It is vital for all known forms of life. On Earth, 96.5% of the planets crust water is found in seas and oceans, 1.7% in groundwater, 1.7% in glaciers and the ice caps of Antarctica and Greenland, a small fraction in other large water bodies, and 0.001% in the air as vapor, clouds (formed of ice and liquid water suspended in air), and precipitation. Only 2.5% of this water is freshwater. 98.8% of that water is in the form of ice (excepting ice in clouds) and groundwater. Less than 0.3% of all freshwater is in rivers, lakes, and the atmosphere, and an even smaller amount of the Earths freshwater (0.003%) is contained within biological bodies and manufactured products. A greater quantity of water is found in the earths interior.
(Wikipedia) 
Leaking Uma Oya 
Ground water aquifers in Heeloya area in Badulla have been damaged and water is leaking in to the Uma Oya tunnel. Four out of seven cracks have paved the way for water to leak in to the tunnel. Three more cracks are expected in the future. Many buildings, located on both sides of the tunnel, are collapsing. This is the pathetic sight within a 15 km area away from the tunnel. 
The destroyed aquifers were naturally created millions of years ago. Therefore they wont replenish in the same speed at which their contents are being sucked by the thirst-driven humans. As a result the chemical content in underground water reaches harmful levels. The ground water level is descending further deeper due to the impact of tube wells.

The ground water aquifers help to steady the earth to some extent. And when it is parched the ground becomes unstable. This is what has happened in Badulla now. Engineers have suggested that villagers close thousands of cracks with mud. But the mud plasters will be washed away with the arrival of the next heavy rains. Meanwhile politicians are planning to distribute water to the villagers using tube wells. 
Politicians are taking water from Badulla to Hambantota. People in Badulla people have protested over losing what they possess while Hambantota residents have protested against not having water. Politicians are playing tricks on civilians. 
Residents of Kalutara and Galle have encountered a serious issue regarding drinking water. This is because rivers in the south are being dug up regularly to obtain sand. This activity has paved the way for salt water to flow into the land which in turn mixes with coastal aquifers. Water projects and water bottling activities are also increasing in the area. There are around 40 tube wells in a place where the ground water is not suitable for consumption. Water is undrinkable in Anuradhapura and Kurunegala. Water in Hambantota contains a high level of calcium carbonate and a high fluoride level. People used natural filtering materials like bricks and limestone in past to make the water fit for consumption. 
Safety of water  
It is said that there are 103 rivers in Sri Lanka. Therefore people have mistaken that this country is gifted with pure water. The tank system, paddy fields and lowlands have been destroyed. The surface water alone cant fulfill the water requirement of the population. Water bodies, forests and paddy fields are necessary to keep the ground water table healthy and replenished. This is what helps recharge the ground water table. 

Deep drilling
Other countries in the world dont permit deep drilling activities like in Sri Lanka. They have identified the importance of water as well as preserving it. 
Recently the Water Resource Board introduced a new law to register water drilling activities. This rule applies to anyone pumping more than 30,000 litres of water. But this law doesnt apply to those pumping water using tube wells. 

Tube wells inthe dry zone 
More than 4980 tube wells have been drilled in Anuradhapura and the dry zone exceeding the limit specified for a square kilometer. Such activities destroyed wells during the regime of the previous president. Sri Lankans assume that they have clean water for sanitation,. Yet the sanitation level in Sri Lanka was clarified during discussions on sustainable development. Estate residents are directing sewage from their toilets into water streams, polluting water in rivers.
Sometimes in urban and areas not falling in to this category the toilet and the well are located close by. This is the set-up in homes where the land is not bigger than 10 perches. This set-up makes living unsafe because contents in the septic tank could leak into the well. Nearly 47% of water available in the country is unsafe due to various leakages. 



Tax, water and controversies

Sajeewa Chamikara -a Naturalist in MONLAR (Movement for National Land and Agricultural Reform) speaks about Water privatization
A number of attempts were made to privatize water in Sri Lanka after taxes were imposed on this commodity. Taxes made water a consumer product. Water is a common resource. If anyone privatized water the public lost the right they had to water. It is easier to prevent an act from being passed rather than defeating the powers which want to maintain water as a commodity with a price. A number of institutions, mostly companies which generate profits through the sale of water, are debating about the quality of the water. These institutions are doing their best to promote public opinion that Drinking bottled water is safe. These institutions took the water act into consideration for their advantage, but their views were defeated. This was due to the presence of several controversies such as taxing the wells and the quality of water. The controversy regarding tax on water was deeper than what it appeared to be. There was a controversy regarding the sale, taxing and destroying the irrigation systems and agriculture in Sri Lanka.


The present situation in Colombo and suburbs 

Hemantha Withanage - Executive Director Centre for Environmental Justice (CEJ), Senior Environmental Scientist
The ground water in Colombo and suburban areas are completely polluted up to Maharagama. Water in some areas smells of kerosene. There is also a presence of heavy metals in the polluted water, Withanage said. 
Water in Rathupaswala is too acidic. Water in Udugampola, Minuwangoda, and Mirigama areas has been affected by tube wells maintained by Indian water bottling companies. These wells suck up ground water and sell it to Indian companies that produce soft drinks. 
Negombo is also in grave danger after the Muthurajawela wetland was turned in to a waste-yard. Garbage enters the water and seeps in to the lagoon. Close to 3000 fishermen make a living off the lagoon. Jagath Senarathna of the University of Peradeniya did a research on the chemical levels in human hair found in the Negombo lagoon. The research revealed that 4.77 micrograms of mercury were found in their hairs. This reading far exceeds the level of mercury supposed to be in human hair. Arsenic and Mercury have both been identified in lagoon water.


Soft drink products
Many foreign investors are interested in investing in Sri Lanka. This is due to globalization. The Coca Cola company banned in India is in the process of relocating here in Horana. This is after this company set its sights on the ground water sources in Sri Lanka. Research done by the CSE on ground water revealed the presence of pesticides in the water released by the company. 
The forceful pumping of water by several Indian companies, to make soft drinks, is recorded in the Udugampola area. The soft drink product, made using ground water in Sri Lanka, was sent to India. Nobody has to pay for ground water in Sri Lanka, hence these companies are by force using our precious water to make profits. This is a violation of a basic human right of Sri Lankans. 
An EIA should be compiled to discourage any company that is pumping huge volumes of water. Ground water sources cant be controlled. This is because ground water is a vast table. The more one obtains ground water, the more ground water comes to fill that space, until the table dries up. Many Indian and local factories located in Ja-Ela are using ground water for their productions. Lack of laws and regulations to control overusing and misusing of water has paved the way for this grave problem in Sri Lanka. 
More than 4000 factories located along the Kelani River bank are releasing waste water into the river. Almost 2000 factories dont possess a license. More than 45% of toilets, located in Kaduwela, dont have toilet pits. As a result a lot of waste has been released into the Kelani River. The PH level of acid in the Kelani Basin reads 2.3. 
Acidic water in Rathupaswala 
It is true that the water in Rathupaswala area is too acidic. People carried water samples to the PHI. That was the only way to determine the acidity in water. The Environmental Authority and the WRB had to check the water in this area and figure out what was wrong with the water. This is the responsibility of the authorities. If there was some other chemical leak in Rathupaswala, the Environmental Authority should have done a research. There could have been a problem in the factory. There is also a possibility that the real reason behind the contamination of water could have been something else. There were no scientific conclusions regarding the water contamination in Rathupaswala. 
Too much acidity is present when heavy metals dissolve in the water. When the PH level reads a figure between 2-3, the water is undrinkable. Water cant be purified once it gets contaminated with heavy metals. 
No scientific background 
No scientific explanations have been produced yet with regard to most of the issues associated with water contamination. Most importantly this is true with environment related issues. Unscientific people are providing scientific explanations and solutions for issues like water contamination. Even if people with a scientific background air their views the public doesnt trust them. This is because they believe that scientists and experts are biased. Other professionals who speak regarding these issues arent very sure about what they are saying. 
Even regarding other environmental issues like the leakage in the Jaffna power plant, water pollution and kidney disease in Rajarata, no one is able to provide a scientific explanation. 
Surface water 
There is no methodology to collect surface water. It is better if one can store water as much as possible. 
Tanks unused and misused 
Some tanks in North Central Province arent being used for irrigation purposes. Certain minor tanks help recharge bigger ones. Kalu Wewa for instance is in a silt blocking stage while the Biso Wewa is to be used instead of Maha Wewas when its water levels decrease. The water discharging from paddy fields goes through the Ketala, Kohila, Nelum and Kumbuk cultivation ( hydro remedial plants). As a result harmful substances are absorbed and the water is purified before it pours in to the next tank (wewa). The tanks in dry zone are a complicated network. The ancestors took good use of these tanks, something that the present people have forgotten. 
Save the environment 
It is said that middle-class people destroy the environment. This happens mostly because they fail to understand the value of a balanced ecosystem. 
Illegal ownership 
Natural resources in our country dont have legal ownership. The river belongs to none, but all. Therefore anyone can do anything with the rivers. Nobody maintains the catchments in the rivers as well. 
Digging of tube wells can be controlled if the authorities charge a fee. In the 90s a tax was to be imposed regarding private wells. Actually this decision was aimed at doing some good, but eventually it turned out to be not so good. Businessmen operating on a large scale should pay tax and not civilians. 
The irrigation projects like Mahaweli are launched to unsure that all the canals are fully concreted. This is done under the pretext that otherwise water will be wasted. If the earth absorbs water through the canals, the ground water table is subject to charged. When water is passed to a tank using a fully concreted canal, it prevents the ground from absorbing water. This in turn makes it easier to fix water metres with regards to agriculture. A natural canal is an ecosystem that has rich volumes of ground water. The safety of croplands depends on the surrounding ground water level. 
Many companies are obtaining water from the ground water table for the use in factories. Some factories sell ground water to other factories. Drilling deep tube wells has had its consequences. This has been the case in the Matara District. Deep wells draw ground water in large quantities. Water has already become a profitable consumer product in the North and East. 
Privatization of water is done very tactfully. The North-Western Local Government has already approved this act. In this area there is a scarcity of water. Bottling water is not the best solution to address the pollution of water. 
There are a number of institutions responsible for the protection of water in Sri Lanka. There are no standards when releasing waste water. Many release water violating the National Environment Act. Some butcheries are functioning close to waterways. The Central Environment Authority (CEA) and Local Government Institutions possess the same power to take action and prevent the privatization of water. The water issue is centered around humans. When it becomes a commodity people are deprived of the right to have it. The Z canal is one such example. Many elephants die falling into it while trying to drink water. 
Water is fast becoming a limited resource in the world. Meanwhile, using of pesticides has become an unstoppable process in Rajarata. It is difficult to change the mindset of the farming generation. Polluted drinking water, pollutants and pesticides could be reasons for kidney disease in Rajarata. 

Wayamba Ela is to be constructed using concrete. If this is done it will deprive the right other animals to consume water. This canal runs through the Kahalla - Pallekale sanctuary. Global institutions like World Bank and Asian Development Bank (ADB) are handling those activities through Government institutions and approve loans. Sri Lanka became the prey of Agro chemicals through the activity of International Monetary Fund (IMF).

Be prepared for dry weather: Experts
	
Sri Lanka should be prepared for dry weather in the coming months, weather experts have warned the government.
Sources from the Prime Ministers office said yesterday that a report submitted by the Sri Lankan weather experts of Department of Meteorology to President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe stated that there could be a drought which might especially affect the North-Central and North-Western provinces at the end of this year and early next year.
The sources said the report was a result of the research carried out by weather experts in Sri Lanka.
Meanwhile, the Australian Weather Bureau had made the same forecast in July this year. According to this forecast El Nino will sink some of the small nations in the coming months. According to the Bureau the Indian Ocean region will experience dry weather as a result of El Nino.
El Nino occurs when winds in the equatorial Pacific slow or reverse direction. That warms water over a vast area,which in turn can up-end weather patterns around the world; it typically reduces rainfall in Australia and across parts of southeast and southern Asia. As probability of a 2017 El Nino rises, analysts have been highlighting the risks for crops," the Australian Weather Bureau said. (Yohan Perera)

'If it's a fault, I will admit, but its not a fault'- MR
	
Former president Mahinda Rajapaksa yesterday said that, if it's a fault, he would admit to the incident of Sil Redi distribution but said it was not a fault.
He expressed these views in response to journalists after visiting former presidents secretary Lalith Weeratunga and former TRC director Anusha Palpita at the Welikada Prison.
I have given eight orders in March, before the presidential election was held, based on requests received by the people. The decision to hand over Sil Redi was only one among these eight decisions and funds to these programmes were allocated right away. This was not made aiming elections as charged by some elements, he said.
He said he never forced his secretary to implement an order and said when a President says something to his secretary, it naturally becomes an order. We dont threaten the secretary with clubs to get work done, he said.
He said even the judges had admitted that the two officers had not received any benefits by implementing the decision.
Meanwhile, he said the health condition of Mr.Weeratunga was not satisfactory and a specialist doctor from the National Hospital had also visited him. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Joe Abeywickrama: The man  who made  us laugh
	
The most difficult person to be is the funny man. By that I dont mean the solitary satirist, the one-man-act savant whom the American cinema took out of the vaudeville houses and popularised: Chaplin, Keaton, Lloyd, the Marx Brothers. I am talking instead about the comedian as we understand him today, the sort who can work with a horde of co-stars and still retain his identity. Part of the reason why Chaplin appears so refreshingly-funny, even today, is his individuality, his belief in standing apart on his own. Not everyone can be a Chaplin, of course, but everyone can easily be or emulate the one-man-savant that he was. Retaining what forms you up as a distinct personality, while keeping your audiences laughing and coming for more, is considerably difficult, not least because we have short attention spans. 

Joe was never solitary, never alone, but at the same time he never made us interested in his own back story
Because its tough being the funny man, its tough getting people to laugh convincingly. If we are extrapolate Lionel Abels thesis, we can say that what is true for his conception of Western tragedy (as thriving on self-consciousness) is true of the general conception of comedy, in both theatre and cinema. The funny man cant betray his ability to make us laugh without betraying himself, which is why comedy in general betrays the falsity of its own medium: through counterfeit, deception, moral ambiguity. Its no cause for wonderment, then, that comedy in Sri Lanka is, if I may be politically-incorrect here, terribly self-defeating: the men and women who try to make us grin immediately yield to their own awareness of how absurd they are. 
Joe Abeywickrama was the culmination of everything Eddie Jayamanne stood for in the theatre (which he never moved out of, as the Minerva Player movies showed). The men and women who made us laugh before him  Pearl Vasudevi, D.R. Nanayakkara, and of course Eddie  out of necessity resorted to exaggeration, the sort that evoked not just laughter but also, to a certain extent, tedium. The result of this was that none of those actors actually broke through their limited canvas, which proved to be their greatest strength and biggest weakness. As the father in Rekava, as the lascivious vidane in Sikuru Tharuwa, as the servant in Ran Salu, to give just three examples, D.R. Nanayakkara could never resist being the funny simpleton. 
The reason for this, obviously, was that these men and women were all from the theatre. So was Joe (his was initiated into the cinema through the studios of Sirisena Wimalaweera, who was no cineaste), but the difference with him was that he didnt enter the movies, he downright conquered them. And the timing couldnt have been more right. Gamini Fonseka had materialised at a time when our heroes and villains were borrowed from Bollywood; he became the first real onscreen hero we could claim. Tony Ranasinghe had materialised at a time when we were getting fed up of those heroes flaunting their masculinity and making escapades from even the most inescapable dilemma; he became our first everyman. Joe, going by that, materialised when we were getting tired of heroes and villains, and ordinary people being stumped by their sense of inadequacy. We wanted to laugh, but in a different way: we wanted someone who could be both a hero and an ordinary man to tickle us into laughter.

So the timing, as I mentioned before, couldnt have been more propitious. Nanayakkara and Jayamanne had taken the theatre with them to the movies. Joe, on the other hand, took what he could from the theatre while shaping himself for the cinema. Thats why theres no blatant attempt at exaggeration (with none of those discernible marks that recall the comedians of the silent era: bulging eyes, dishevelled hair) in his earliest performances, when his roles consisted of keeping his co-star from unhappiness: Gamini Fonseka in Getawarayo, Henry Jayasena in Dahasak Sithuvili. 
Joe was never solitary, never alone, but at the same time he never made us interested in his own back story. Towards the end of Hal Ashbys Being There we see the protagonist (Peter Sellers) literally walking on a lake (is he God Jesus). Throughout the story our attitude towards him is tempered by our consideration of him as an everyday, ordinary man who might have stepped out from anywhere. He keeps his benefactor happy, his daughter consoled but unfulfilled, and their family doctor suspicious. This curious blend of happiness, consolation, and mystery is what makes up Joes most recognisable performances: we dont know where hes from, only that hes there to placate the main character, and with the maincharacter, us. 
Because he had no background, and we didnt know where he came from, we were content in seeing his antics and laughing at them. Towards the end of the sixties we could feel that his stints in comedy had become a prelude to other roles, more varied and diverse. The difference between Saravita and Punchi Baba is subtle, but discernible and rather reflective of this: in the former everyone is trying to get something from him, a bulath vita seller, while in the latter he is not just the centre of drama (as before), but the centre of our attention, and hence the whole plot. 
Just as his early performances in comedy were tempered by the serious, the dramatic, his later performances in drama were tempered by the unserious, the flippant. You can discern this in Welikathara, his second dramatic outing after Thun Man Handiya: in one scene he is a dangerous, Cape Fear-esque antagonist-from-the-past, and in the very next he bottles up all his rage, his motives, with calculated, witty asides (his first encounter with Swineetha Weerasinghes character Geetha, on the beach and around her car, plays around with this dualism). Even in Pathirajas Bambaru Avith, as the villain Anton Aiya, those asides temper his evilness rather incongruously (Dore Dore nemeyi, janele! he shouts at an errant lorry driver). Joe had wanted to be more than a humorist; in becoming a dramatic, unlikeable antagonist, though, he was finding it difficult to escape being that humorist. It just kept coming back. 

Because he had no background, and we didnt know where he came from, we were content in seeing his antics and laughing at them. Towards the end of the sixties we could feel that his stints in comedy had become a prelude to other roles, more varied and diverse
And partly because of this, he never let go of that sense of mystery which had lingered with him before. In Desa Nisa, Lester James Peries attempt at moving Joe into a more serious role, he salvages an otherwise jerkily-edited final sequence with his enigmatic intentions: Does he want his wife cured of her blindness, or does he want her to remain as she is since shes the only woman who will never be repelled by his deformities We arent really sure, particularly when he plays along to the shrewd hermit (Ravindra Randeniya) and gets him what he needs to make her see again. 
When the moment of revelation does come, however, it doesnt quite have the punch that everything leading up to it had us expect: neither the deformed man, Nirudaka, nor his mother (Denawaka Hamine) express anything more than mild distress. But consider Nirudaka: his distraught eyes, his act of walking away after the girl Sundari (Sriyani Amarasena) laughs at his face (again, a mystery: is it because she thinks hes ugly or because she realises why he wanted to keep her from getting cured so badly), and his act of weeping alone in the forest, is tempered by intrigue, and in the end, after husband and wife lovingly reconcile, we are left wondering as to whether he ran away because he was relieved enough to yield to, or depressed enough to cry at, her thoughtlessness. Despite a rather unsatisfactory finale (which expects us to believe that the hermit would let Sundari go without a single scene depicting his change of mind), therefore, all three characters  the man, the wife, the mother  keep us intrigued, the wife because of her laughter and the mother because of her realisation that the whole world considers her son ugly, hideous, unkempt, misshaped. 
Desa Nisa was not a success, and is considered today as one of Lesters lesser films (considered as lesser, that is, without a proper rationale). But it did get Lester to achieve what he wanted, at least partly: opening up Joes range. Desa Nisa was released after Welikathara, but in Welikathara he was more antagonistic than tragic (which is why, in the final sequence, you feel as though some outside force was transforming his encounter with Wickrema Randeniya into an abrupt and clichd shoot-up that ends with him being killed like a dog). Desa Nisa, and before it Thun Man Handiya, was reflective of the confused, well-meaning, but thwarted characters he would play in later years, in Siribo Aiya, Soldadu Unnahe, Baddegama, Palama Yata, Awaragira, Purahanda Kaluwara, Aswesuma (his last great performance). 

He got us to betray our laughter, our facile view of life, without betraying himself. That and that alone explains his range, his wider canvas, his great ability
These were the ultimate tragic figures of our cinema, more tragic than Tonys, whose characters were all thwarted not because of outside forces, but because of personal inadequacies. In becoming the supreme comedian of his time, to be equalled somewhat by Vijaya Nandasiri, Joe had become a supreme tragic figure. By playing around with these two opposites, rather subtly, he gradually became the funny man that wed always wanted, who could keep us transfixed to his face throughout a film. 
If Gamini were our first onscreen hero, then Joe became our first onscreen humorist, with a caveat: he never confused the ability to make us laugh and move us to empathy with the ability to keep us aware that we were seeing him and not his performance. He got us to betray our laughter, our facile view of life, without betraying himself. That and that alone explains his range, his wider canvas, his great ability.

LG elections in January: EC Chief
	
The Local Government elections are likely to be held on or after January 20, 2018, Chairman Elections Commission (EC) Chief Mahinda Deshapriya said today.
"The elections cannot be held in December this year because of the GCE ordinary level examination. The Commissioner of Examination has asked us not to hold elections on the available date of December 9, 2017" the EC Chief said during the signing of an MOU with the Asian Network on Free and Fair Elections last afternoon.
"It is not possible to hold elections on December 30 or 31st because state institutions carry out their audits before the turn of the year no one will be able to take leave. The only other available date would be mid January and we cannot hold the polls on that day as well because of Thai Pongal. Therefore the next available date would be January 20 next year," he said.
The EC said the Municipal Council, Urban Council and Pradeshiya Sasha Ordinances would have to be amended to make provisions for the 40/60 ratio under the proposed mixed system. Therefore Parliament has not put the ball on our court to go ahead with the elections," he said.
Meanwhile, he said the Elections Commission would have to issue notice declaring elections to three provincial councils -- Uva, North Central and Sabaragamuwa on October 2, 2017 if the proposed 20th Amendment is not duly passed by then.
If the election is declared in October it has to be held in December 6 this year. However the views of the examination commissioner will have to be sought as the Ordinary level exam will also be held around that time, the EC said.(Yohan Perera)

Military in North should not be removed: Gammanpila
	
Responding to a statement made by Northern Province Chief Minister C. V. Wigneswaran on Sunday, Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) General Secretary and MP Udaya Gammanpila said the security forces in the North should not be removed following some logical conclusions.
Addressing a news briefing, he stated that it was too early and risky to remove military personnel from the Northern Province as it was just eight years had passed since the war was ended.
I dont fathom on account of which grounds the Chief Minister has made such a formidable statement which might even affect the security of the country, he stressed.
He proceeded to say that as a country which had been embroiled in a civil war, is not ready to confront with another civil war.
"Therefore, we as PHU are opposed to remove defence personnel from the North and request the government to take prompt steps to prevent from removing military personnel from the North," he said.
Meanwhile, he asked why the President and the Prime Minister are silent on the controversial statements made by Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka.
We have a reasonable suspicion that the President and the Prime Minister are deliberately neglecting to come out with any remarks on the statements made by Sarath Fonseka.We urge the President to interfere into this case and take instant actions to arrest and sack him from his ministerial portfolio as soon as possible, Mr. Gammanpila added.

The Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) said today it would accept the maintenance allowance to MPs though on principle it was opposed to the granting of such an allowance.
JVP MP and Propaganda Secretary Vijitha Herath told a media briefing that his party was opposed to the proposed Rs.100,000 office maintenance allowance to parliamentarians but its MPs would accept it so that others would not get the chance to grab these funds.
If our MPs refrain from accepting this allowance, others will rob it, he said and added that they were opposed to it because MPs receive enough facilities.
The government will spend Rs.134 million to pay office maintenance allowance to the MPs.(Yohan Perera)

PM delivers harsh wake-up call to private sector
	
The private sector yesterday received a rather harsh wake-up call from Prime Minster Ranil Wickremesinghe, where he asserted the need for the private sector to pick up pace in supporting the national economy to reach the countrys ambitious economic goals. 
Keeping in mind the expiry date of the unity government, which will reach its full term in three years from now, Wickremesinghe stressed that it is imperative the private sector get its act together within that period.
We have a lot more to do in reaching our economic goals and for that, you (private sector) need to leverage on the opportunities created by the government. Understand that in the next three years, for the country to achieve its growth, we want you all to expand, Wickremesinghe told the private sector leaders last evening as he addressed CIMA Business Leaders Summit 2017 in Colombo.
It was pointed out that the need of the hour in fulfilling the governments aspirations are  the need to unleashing the potential of local entrepreneurs, encouraging private FDI, capitalizing on GSP Plus, maximizing the use of the new ease of doing business law and facilitating investments.
Referring to these measures as the nuts and bolts of the envisaged plans, Wickremesinghe asserted it is time for the private sector to change gear.If we dont do this now, we will be nowhere. Understand the advantages before you and go by the comparative advantages. The future depends on technology and innovation. The world is fast changing and in that where we stand we need to question, he opined.
Wickremesinghe also took a jab at the previous regime by highlighting its failure in bringing sustained stability.
Noting that the country suffered from misappropriation during the previous regime that hampered growth and development, Wickremesinghe sang praises to the current governments initiatives in bringing in the stability factor.
While pointing out that the progress achieved since the inheritance of a struggling economy, Wickremesinghe said: The government can create the environment but it is up to you all to decide how to use it. We must understand that the economy is central to everything we do.It was warned that if the created opportunities were not exploited, soon Bangladesh would surpass Sri Lanka in terms of GDP per capita, as in the case of Pakistan. This is the last chance we have, he stressed.
You need to realize that innovation and technology is imperative and that is what matters. Reiterating the need for greater collaboration between the public and private sectors, he pointed out Sri Lanka is presented with a wonderful opportunity since it has a national governmenthaving the two main political parties on one page.Political and economic stability is important but both alone is insufficient if we dont have enterprises. We are changing the business landscape. All I can tell you is we are doing our best, you do your best and the country will reach its best, said Wickremesinghe concluding his remarks.

UNHR Chief highlights need for universal jurisdiction in SL
	
UN Human Rights High Commissioner Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein said on Monday the absence of credible action in Sri Lanka to ensure accountability for alleged violations of international human rights and humanitarian laws has made the exercise of universal jurisdiction even more necessary.
In his address to the 36th session of the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva on human rights concerns around the world, Prince Zeid urged the Sri Lankan Government to swiftly operationalize the Office of Missing Persons (OMP).
The Government should also move faster on other essential confidence-building measures such as the release of land occupied by the military and resolving long-pending cases registered under the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA). I repeat my request for the PTA to be replaced with a new law in line with international human rights standards, he said.
Prince Zeid said in the North, protests by victims indicate their growing frustration over the slow pace of reforms.
He said he encouraged the Government to act on its commitment in Resolution 30/1 to establish transitional justice mechanisms and to establish a clear timeline and benchmarks for the implementation of these and other commitments.
This should not be viewed by the Government as a box-ticking exercise to placate the Council, but as an essential undertaking to address the rights of all its people, Prince Zeid said.

US legislators oppose 92% cut in aid to SL
	
A US Senate committee has opposed Trump Administrations proposal of a drastic 92 per cent cut in US aid to Sri Lanka, citing the geographical and strategic location of the country, the PTI reported today.
The Senate Appropriations Committee had said in a report that it wont support President Trumps budget request for Sri Lanka, which proposed a 92 per cent reduction in assistance from the prior fiscal year.

The annual State appropriations bill for the fiscal year 2018, beginning October 1, landed on the Senate floor yesterday for consideration.
The bill seeks USD 43 million for Sri Lanka. According to the PTI, this includes USD 35 million as economic support fund, USD 6.8 million for non-proliferation and anti-terrorism and USD 500,000 in foreign military financing and an equal amount for training of military personnel.
The Committee recognises and supports the efforts of the Government of Sri Lanka to advance democracy and the rule of law, and encourages further steps to address the underlying causes of the armed conflict by promoting justice and reconciliation, the Senate Committee said.
The committees report said that Sri Lanka is strategically positioned along key shipping lanes and emerging from decades of conflict. The House Appropriations Committee has also passed its Foreign Appropriations Bill, but defers from that of its Senate bill on Sri Lanka. Last week during a Congressional hearing, lawmakers had expressed concern over massive cut in US aid to Sri Lanka.
In Sri Lanka, US foreign assistance will be cut by 92 per cent, mostly from accounts that have supported programs to promote the rule of law, democratic reforms, post-Civil War reconciliation and related efforts, rued Congressman Ted Yoho, Chairman of House Foreign Affairs Sub Committee on Asia and the Pacific.
These programs are cost-effective ways to contribute to Sri Lankas transformation while pursuing a partnership and strategic lead critical locations. Even at their height in 2016, US assistance commitments to Sri Lanka were about 42.5 million, and thats a bit less than half the cost of a single F-35 fighter jet. That seems like a reasonable investment to gain a friend in one of the worlds most critical sea lanes, Yoho said.
While were forming a large Millennium Challenge Corporation compact in Sri Lanka, the MCC will focus on economic activities. Im concerned that by changing course so drastically, we want to make sure that were not throwing away the investments weve already made in Sri Lanka, leaving a gap in the democracy and governance programs Sri Lanka badly needs, and potentially forcing the closure of our USAID mission, said the US lawmaker.
For the fiscal year 2018, the Trump Administration has requested USD 3.4 million in foreign assistance for Sri Lanka. It focuses on strong support for security cooperation and enhanced strategic trade controls, while contributing to Sri Lankas progress toward becoming a mine-impact-free nation by 2020.
Additionally, the MCC is developing a compact with Sri Lanka after it successfully passed the MCC policy scorecard in 2016. In June, MCC approved an initial USD 7.4 million to study potential projects and conduct due diligence work in the transport and land sectors. MCC is working closely with the Government of Sri Lanka to bring a compact for Board approval in 2018, the PTI reported quoting the US State Department.

What US Navys Fr. Gallagher and Fr. Feagle did for the SL Navy
	
We, Old Joes are well aware that you, Chaplain R.R.W.F. Pereira, have been doing Marine & Navy Missions chaplaincy work in the Port of Colombo for many years. I came to know that you have been in this honorary voluntary ministry for about 40 years, said Chief Engineer Abeyesekera. You are right, Chief, it would be 40 years on March 30, 2016.. The documentary evidence I could produce to substantiate this historical fact is a call card that Warden Mr. Felix Abeykoon gave me when we went to the Port 40 years ago. Though I am not from the Missions to Seamen Club, I accompanied its warden to the Port that day as it was very necessary for him, Fr. Pereira said. 
 Father, could you, please, like to elaborate on some important happening that took place during these 40 years, I asked. I have this young naval officer from the Sri Lanka Navy with me today and I think I have got something very interesting and appropriate to tell you which would very much be of interest to him and the people of Sri Lanka responded Fr Pereira and then went on saying. 
One morning in the mid eighties I went along the Queen Elizabeth Quay from ship to ship on my usual ship visits. The last ship I boarded was the USS naval vessel, Samuel Gompers. I walked up the gangway with my identity card held up in my right hand. I heard an officer say He seems to know how to identify himself. I received the usual salute. After which the duty officer asked me what I needed. I said that Id like to meet the chaplain on board. The chaplain then came and took me to his office. We had a quiet and friendly introductory talk. As far as I could remember he was Chaplain Fr. Bob N Feagle, US Navy. When we finished our talk he said, Thank you for your visit. I then left the vessel. 
When I came to my office that day I heard the office secretary say that there was a lady who was in tears because her son has been bitten by a dog and the Pharmacist at the General Hospital had the anti-rabies serum for dog bites but would not give it to her son unless he was paid Rs.4000 for it. I did not pay much attention to this as I knew that I was not in a position to do anything to get it for her nor to get the Rs.4000 commission needed. 
The next day as I did the previous day I went along the QEQ and finally ended up in the USS Samuel Gompers naval vessel. We, the two chaplains, the one on the vessel and I the honorary voluntary service chaplain for the US Navy by the invitation of the Pearl Harbor Fleet Chaplain in Hawaii, sat down once again to talk matters over. When our conversation came to a finish I just mentioned about the Sri Lankan mother who was desperately looking for the anti-rabies serum for her twelve year old son. 
As I was about to head to the gangway Chap. Bob N Feagle said looking at me Wait a minute Chaplain Pereira. He then went up to his telephone and gave a call to Chaplain Fr. Gallagher who was at that time on USS Super Air Craft Carrier Kitty Hawk which was anchored at Panadura and asked him if the Doctor on that Air Craft Carrier had the specific anti rabies serum needed. The response was positive. Chaplain Gallagher then told Chaplain Feagle that he would have the anti-toxic serum sent to the Sri Lankan Air Force Grounds. That was to the Saracens grounds where we had watched many a match and had seen Old Joe Captain Keerthi R Caldera keeping wickets for the
Sri Lankan Air Force Team. 
We, the two chaplains disembarked,got into a car that was at the QEQ. It sped off to the Air Force Grounds. We got off the vehicle and waited. It did not take ten minutes for me to spot the USS Air Force Helicopter coming our way. It landed with the wind blowing up my hair and cassock. An officer jumped off the Helicopter with the required serum in a polythene bag filled with ice cubes. It was given to Chaplain Feagle who handed it over to me. We then got into the car and came back to the Port where my bicycle had been parked. 
I rode to the church where our secretary a Miss Carmichael worked. I handed over the ice packed bag with the serum to her. She put it into a flask with ice and got it in quick time to the childs mother. 
The child was then given the serum by the doctor at the General Hospital. I then looked at the Naval Officer who was with us and said Well son, you were that boy the dog had bitten and today you are Lieutenant Commander S N Dias of the Sri Lankan Navy, whom Chaplain Fr. Gallagher of Super Air Craft Carrier, USS, Kitty Hawk had saved. I concluded saying to the young Sri Lankan Naval Officer, As we all thank Chap. Fr. Gallagher of the US Navy please remember to Praise and Thank God for making all the connections and timing to fit into place so perfectly well. Gods timings are perfect timings.  
Dear Chief Engineer Sunil Abeyesekera you seem to come in at the correct time to write the right thing worthwhile at my 40th anniversary. If you had not come the People of the US and the people of Sri Lankans would not have known what the US Navy did for the Sri Lankan Navy. Thank you.

Will surround Colombo on 15: GMOA
	
The Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) today warned that it would surround the Colombo City on Friday (15) if the government failed to provide an lasting solution to the SAITM issue.
It said that the Presidential committee appointed to look into the matter headed by Deputy Minister Harsha de Silva was to hand over its report last Monday (11) but had failed to do so leaving them with no option put to launch a trade union action.
GMOA Assistant Secretary Dr. Naveen De Zoysa said the there was no use in appointing Presidential committees as only the Health Ministers views were being sought and would be implemented.
Therefore he warned the government to brace itself for a backlash as the whole of Colombo would be surrounded by members of the GMOA and many anti-SAITM forces on Friday (15), thus causing the authorities much inconvenience if they did not solve the issue before that.
He advised the general public to get ready to be inconvenienced as a result or to avoid entering Colombo during the time the trade union action would take place.
Further, he said the GMOA had given the government a deadline, which was September 21 to come up with a solution to the SAITM issue and warned that an Islandwide trade union action would be launched after the deadline date. After the 21st the government will experience unprecedented trade union action that would be launched by us, he said.(Thilanka Kanakarathna)
