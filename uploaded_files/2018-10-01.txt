A Day at Colombo?s Book ?Carnival?
	
?There is a great deal of difference between an eager man who wants to read a book and the tired man who wants a book to read.?
?- Gilbert K. Chesterton
?
As I leisurely strolled down the pathways leading to the halls marked A to R at the BMICH last Tuesday, at September?s Colombo International Book Fair, without visiting any of the 400 plus BOOK Stalls, I reminisced the Colombo Caf?, the iconic and popular lunch outlet that was located at the GOH end of York Street in 1960s, for it?s famously highlighted Sign, ?This is the Place to Eat & Drink? prominently while the brand name ?Colombo Caf?? in relatively smaller font. Only once I entered the halls that housed book stalls that I realized the significance of the annual mid-September Book Fair.? ?
It is a major event in the literary calendar of Sri Lanka being the largest annual book lovers? dream, organised by the indomitable spirits of Sri Lanka Book Publishers? Association.??
Introduction of Authors??
Presence of eminent authors at the stalls run by leading Publishers is intended to present the best trading background for book industry. Professionals as well as the literary enthusiasts appreciated the novel idea. I saw Ajit Kanagasundram, son of former civil servant K. Kanagasundram, first Chairman of the Gal Oya Board and an intimate of D S Senanayake autographing his work ?Tale of two nations? at the Vijitha Yapa?s Stall. Prof. J B Dissanayake was at Sarasavi, engaged in autographing his books for the readers. The show runs for nine days, usually in late September. Book Fair is carefully crafted with the experiences for all those that participate in the publishing industry. It?s where booksellers, authors, distributors, literary agents, librarians, publishers come together to build relationships.? ?
A wealth of knowledge under one roof??
Drifting in and out of exhaust after rushing through the crowded stalls ? shoving, pushing, and jostling at some of the popular brands was, they say ?like in Piccadilly Circus?. The spacious areas within sections A and B in Sirimavo Bandaranaike Hall was lively with people who were busy searching for a book; others who accompanied book lovers were enjoying themselves by reading a fairy tale to a kid from a nursery book. Quite an impressive presence of children of all age groups signified the keenness for books in spite of their ?addiction? to internet and social media. There were plenty of nice food courts ranging from Game Kade that served Manioc, Kadala and Helapa to Mt. Lavinia run restaurants and several tea kiosks serving hot or cold. People rush in to stalls pick up a book as fast as they could, and often travelled in groups; parents and children including tiny tots or other relatives and friends - stalls were stuffed with books and in some the book sellers made the passages awfully narrow forcing them to stroll in a straight file like military men going to battle. Sweaty buyers in non-air-conditioned stalls competently weave their way by finding little gaps between people and squeezing all the way through.??
Visiting one of my good school buddies some decades ago in O/L days, whose father who had no book education told me ?Son, ensure that your best friend is the book?, I cursed him and stopped visiting my class-mate at his home thereafter, but regretted my attitude years later reading Ernest Hemingway who famously said ?There is no friend as loyal as a book.???
Held for the 20th occasion this year, it was opened under the patronage of the Minister of Education which coincided with a presentation of scholarships to students who displayed their skills in education. Nearly a million book lovers from all parts of the island visit the fair over 10 days every year. More than 400 exhibitors,10% of them from overseas, participated in it, most of the publishers, importers and retailers at Book Fair do offer the books at 20% off their regular selling price, while the bargain section offers more attractive discounts.??
?Daru Diriya? scholarship fund is benefited by the entrance fee of Rs. 20 paid by visitors. Another highlight of the book fair will be the ?Mirror Wall? or ?Ketapath Pawura? which offers visitors an opportunity to write a creative piece of poetry which will be compiled into a volume and published by the Book Publishers. Kids? Corner with a few activities, book launches and literary discussions, cultural events like dramas and musical performances sponsored by the Ministry of Higher Education and Cultural Affairs, have added extra glamour to the Fair.? ?
Writers, publishers meeting point
Once you?ve written your manuscript, naturally, you expect to get it into as many readers as possible, the best way to do that is to negotiate with many potential publishers within a few hours and under the same roof. There are some fundamentals of your book sales approach that can make a big difference regarding how well a new book sells, and this can be discussed at the book stall itself. Search for an old book which is out of print - it can be picked up in one of several second-hand stalls, or a newly published high-quality literature, non-fiction, young adult, and coffee table types, sourced from numerous publishers around the world at discounted prices. I saw Sinhala fiction titles flying off the shelves at a rate along with an unbelievable selection of children?s books including activity books, bedtime stories, educational tools and stationery at reduced rates that are up for grabs. The main aim of the book sale should be to encourage readers of all ages to discover the pleasure of reasonably priced reading.? ?
Cultural events?
Visitors can patronize in assorted cultural activities sponsored by Ministry of Cultural Affairs, apart from buying books - I was enthralled by the performers of Kolam, the traditional folk art, when they staged the ?Police Kolama? [the presenter took precautions, by praising the present police high ups, but that the play was about colonial cops. I, personally, did not see any difference watching the hilarious drama]??
?
The missing bookman: Martin Wickremasinghe?at Caves??
Five decades plus years ago the traditional Book-Man carrying ?hundred books? on his shoulder visited once a week or so every home in the urban areas where English readers lived. You select a few novels [his stock usually consists of 90% fiction] for a nominal weekly rental, say one-fourth of the value or buy it outright. In the city instead of the mobile book shop, you find the street corner old-book vendor who provides the same service from his pavement?s make-shift hut. Martin Wickremesinghe, the acclaimed father of modern Sinhala literature says in his biography how he trained his five children to become ?bookworms? by renting each one a book from the bookman who frequented his house at Mt Lavinia in the 1930s-40s.??
Young Martin with no credentials to boast of book education being a school drop-out was a self-learner who visited the Caves book shop in Fort and spent hours reading sections of texts displayed there for sale. Once the owner, a European, walked up to the young man and said, ?I do not mind you using this place as a reference point, but please do not use your wet finger tip to turn pages.?? ?
The e-book revolution and the truth??
In times of digital content the art of reading is changing, but, does it give less pleasure or is it just the opposite? Is there a difference between a printed book or an audio-book or any other variety of multimedia-appliance generated ?books?? I doubt, there isn?t a difference between a quality paper and e-screen. One can argue, the biggest pleasure comes from what we read, not from on what we read: may be the real difference lies in our attitude to reading.??
?After decades of reading printed books, and years after Amazon initiated the e-book, readers finally stuck to it and downloaded the Kindle app to their I-Phones and commenced buying and reading e-books. They quickly become hooked on the ease way. Pull their i-Phones out of the pocket while driving, buy an e-book with the tap of a finger, and start reading. Is it the beginning of a trend or just a one-time occurrence? True they save money and time - the much cheaper cost compared to the printed book, with the surcharge that the seller whack on your credit card as cost of shipping. Though we enjoy the convenience, versions of books just don?t bring the same visual and perceptible pleasure one gets from reading printed books.? ?
According to Wall Street statistics, sales of print books had gained 6% in America in 2017, while those of e-books sank by 14%. What makes printed versions much more unique than e-books? Physical books encourage sharing - on shelves in shop or private libraries invite likely readers to leaf through and borrow, while, E-books remain in the owner?s reading apparatus.?
Sharing with a friend will never happen, and I wouldn?t be able to underline a passage that I wished to refer back. Print book is ?transparent?; anybody can see what the reader is doing, and it sets a good example for the children.??
Ralph Waldo Emerson once said, ?If we encounter a man of rare intellect, we should ask him what books he reads.???

DIG Nalaka Silva's room sealed
	
The office of the DIG Nalaka Silva, who is in charge of Terrorist Investigation Division (TID) in Colombo, was sealed as a result of the ongoing probe against him, police sources said.
A senior officer at the Police Headquarters said yesterday that two laptop computers had also been taken into custody from his office for the investigations.
The DIG has been sent on compulsory leave after investigating into a complaint that had been made by the Operations Director of Anti-Corruption Movement Namal Kumara.
According to the complaint, DIG had allegedly conspired to assassinate the President Maithripala Sirisena and former Secretary of Defense Gotabhaya Rajapaksa.
The voice recordings and a mobile phone relevant to this conspiracy had been handed over to the CID and the Government Analyst by Namal Kumara for investigations according to a court order.
According to CID sources, a statement is scheduled to be recorded from the DIG Nalaka Silva after summoning him to CID regarding this assassination plot.
The court had already ordered the Department of Government Analyst to present a data investigation report to the court. (Srinath Prasanna Jayasuriya)

Economic crisis -- Mangala mum when warned by experts: GMOA
	
The GMOA said today Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera was silent when economic experts had predicted well in advance about a rupee depreciation and the economic crisis.
Its Secretary Haritha Aluthge said the MPs had requested people to tighten their belts while they continued to enjoy luxury lifestyles.
?Amid an economic crisis, the provincial councils are enacting dramas with unnecessary expenses. The subject minister did not take any preventive measures even when advised by the experts. It is unfair to heap this burden on the people,? he said.
Dr. Aluthge said the duty free vehicle permits for MPs' cost some Rs.7 billion each year.
He said though the Finance Minister had suspended the issuance of duty free permits to MPs, by then most of them had purchased vehicles or sold their permits.
Meanwhile, GMOA Assistant Secretary Samantha Herath said the country?s economic management had broken down.
?On the one hand the Government is calling for the restriction on the import of luxury consumer goods, but on other hand they are importing services, which contribute to more than 56 per cent drain on the country?s economy, through FTA?s with Singapore and Thailand,? he said.
Dr. Herath claimed that when professionals speak of the economy they were criticized.
?Today the citizens are suffering from the consequences of economic mis-mangement and the failure to draft a national policy,? he said. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

There was a counter plot to kill DIG Nalaka De Silva, who was accused of a plot to assassinate President Maithripala Sirisena and Gotabaya Rajapaksa, Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) leader and MP Udaya Gammanpila claimed today.??
Addressing a news briefing, he said the best option available for the conspirators was assassination of DIG De Silva, so that he would then be silent forever with the secrets he possessed.
?We have evidence in the past in relation to cases where prominent people were arrested and remanded irrespective of their offices or social standings when they were accused of such plots.
?When the Government received a false information that Vasudeva Nanayakkara was involved in the insurrection in 1971, he was arrested and remanded despite of being a MP in the then Government,? Gammanpila said.
?Soon after hearing the attempted coup of 1962, the Government arrested every suspect including several DIGs and Army Colonels,? he said.
?An attempt to assassinate the President is not a mere homicide attempt. It is against the State. In such a background, it is questionable as to why the incumbent Government behaves in a strange manner with regard to DIG Silva,? he added. (Sheain Fernandopulle)

It wasn't China who asked for H'tota Port, it was us: Minister Samarasinghe
	
While rejecting claims that either Sri Lanka have sold the Hambantota Port to China Merchant Port or that China coming and taking the Hambantota Port to achieve their geo-political objectives, Minister of Ports and Shipping Mahinda Samarasinghe said that it was not China who asked for the Hambantota Port but Sri Lanka who offered it.
?It was not China who asked for the Hambantota Port, but it was us,? the minister said addressing the 69th Anniversary of the Founding of the People?s Republic of China held at the BMICH last Friday. The event was organized by the Sri Lanka-China Journalist Forum.
Addressing the event further the minister also said, ?Our Prime Minister, who was in China met the Chinese President and Prime Minister there and appealed from Chinese leadership to help us to make the debt obligation that had resulted in this huge amount of money that was lent to us by China to build the two phases of the Hambantota Port.?
He also said that when the Sri Lankan Prime Minister suggested that the loan should be rescheduled or delayed because Sri Lanka were finding it difficult to pay back the loan, the China told Premier ?if you do it for Sri Lanka you have to do it for other countries therefore it is difficult us to consider this moment, but had said that they would find an investor.?
From that investment money, it can be used to repay the debt, that had accumulated and that we were finding difficult to pay back, he said.
?I think this should go on record, because there are some who take rhetorical positions, that we have either sold the Hambantota Port to China Merchant Port or that China coming and taking the Hambantota port to achieve geo-political objectives. This was never at any time ever discussed on the agenda and when the concession agreement was negotiated Chinese side always said, we abide by the constitution of Sri Lanka we respect to your laws of the country, we will operate within the framework of the laws of the country,? Minister Samarasinghe said.
?There were no other objectives other than a purely commercial transaction, which took place. It brought in 1.12 billion USD, the highest foreign direct investment ever to be brought to Sri Lanka,? he said.
?The company who invested this money alone with the Sri Lanka Ports authority looking at going at third phase beginning next year, within the next three years 600 million USD will be invested, for the development of infrastructure etc, so that Hambantota ports could be fully operational and it?s a win win situation,? he added.
Minister Gayantha Karunathilake, Ambassador of China in Sri Lanka Cheng Xueyuan, MP Ven. Rathana Thera, MP Udaya Gammanpila, President of the Sri Lanka-China Journalist Forum (SLCJF) Nalin Aponso and several others participated in the event.

Looking to modernise Mahinda Chinthanaya: Gota
	
Former defence secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa has said that they are continuing to discuss with professionals from all social spheres on how to carry forward the 'Mahinda Chinthanaya' based on current trends and developments.
He told a conference organised by the 'Eliya' Organisation at Kaduwela on Sunday that the views of professionals were important to resolve contentious issues and carry out development projects when a new government assumes office.
Mr. Rajapaksa said this government had misled the people and fed them with lies to win the previous elections but has no plans whatsoever for administering the country.
"It did not have a proper mechanism or a plan to administer the country when they took office. That is why the country is in turmoil today. The former government however, administered the country based on a set of principles under the Mahinda Chinthanaya," he said.
Mr. Rajapaksa said the stakeholders in the government should take the responsibility for the current economic crisis.
?We had plans to develop the ports and airports. This government stopped these projects. With the economic collapse, these projects have slowed down," Mr.Rajapaksa said.
He said all pillars of society including the security, law and order and the economy had collapsed during the 4-year tenure of the new government.
MPs Gamini Lokuge, Susil Premajayantha, Udaya Gammanpila and Wimal Weerawansa were present at the event. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

October 1 - World Habitat Day: Solid Waste Management an integral part of Environmental Conservation
	
The World Habitat Day was declared by the United Nations General Assembly in the year 1985. The day dedicated was Monday October 1 every year. The theme of this year?s World Habitat Day is ?Municipal Solid Waste Management?? ?
UN-Habitat has addressed a many policy issues like waste policy, technology, good and Bad practices, Management, financing and governance focused on the process of sustainability.? ?
Municipal Solid Waste Management? ?
What is solid waste? Solid waste refers to a wide range of garbage created by human and animal activities discarded as unwanted and useless. The main creators of solid waste are residential, industrial and Commercial activists in the given municipal areas.? ?
Warm and humid climate makes solid waste extremely putrid. The waste therefore has to be removed and disposed of quickly, efficiently, and safely before it gives rise to bad odour, infectious disease, and other public health hazards. The Ministry of Local Government should develop a comprehensive and reliable garbage -collection system for all municipal councils and the other local authority areas. A proper methodology has to be adopted to collect and dispose of garbage on daily basis to prevent problems associated with the decomposition of organic wastes.? ?
Hundreds of tons of solid waste is disposed within Municipal areas every day. These wastes come from homes, offices, industries and various other agricultural activities and market places. If this solid waste is not properly collected, it can pollute the surroundings and it can seriously affect the health of human, domestic pets and our environment. The sources of solid waste can be classified as follows.? ?
?
	Residential ? Garbage of the residences can be classified as food waste, plastics, paper, glass, leather, metal, garden waste, cardboard, batteries, old mattresses used oil cans, tyres, electronic items and discarded bulk households? items etc.? ?
	
	
	Commercial ? can be referred to hotels, markets, restaurants, stores and office buildings. Solid waste generated from these places are food waste, paper, cardboard materials, glass, metal and other hazardous waste.? ?
	
	
	Construction and demolition waste - This include new construction sites, demolished sites, building renovation sites, road construction sites. Solid waste produced in these sites are waste building materials, broken concrete, wood, rubber, plastics, glass, wire and dirt.? ?
	
	
	Municipal services - Solid waste generated by municipal services include dirt collected by street cleaning, landscaping, recreational areas, parks and beaches etc.? ?
	
	
	Biomedical Institutions ? Hospital, Medical equipment and chemical manufacturing institutions. Hospitals produce syringes, bandages, used gloves, drugs, plastics, food waste and chemicals. In all these cases proper and scientific disposal has to be done, else they will cause a huge health problem to the neighbours and to the environment.? ?
	
Solid Waste Management can be considered as a multidisciplinary effort associated with the control of its generation, storage, collection, transport/ transfer, processing and disposal of the solid waste materials to safeguard a range of issues like public health, environmental and aesthetic value of the area. In addition, solid waste framework needs to include proper planning administration, financial and legal functions.? ?
The collection and disposal of municipal solid waste has become a widely discussed issue among the public, local politicians, and planners, particularly in the urban areas. Haphazard disposal along the road sides and other public places have led to a number of problems such as, environmental pollution, water contamination, and increase in epidemic diseases.? ?
Dumping of waste materials in this manner make biodegradable materials to rot and decompose under unhygienic and uncontrolled conditions. After a few days of decomposition, the decomposed material emanates foul smell and become a breeding ground for different types of diseases causing insects and other infectious organisms. This spoils the aesthetic value and the land values in the area. Solid waste from industries are a source of toxic metals and hazardous wastes and chemicals that may be injurious to human life and the soil. This may affect or can alter the productivity of the soil in the particular area. Toxic chemical can seep in to the soil and pollute the ground water. Hence it is obvious that the financial viability of waste management systems are more complicated than that of a commercial enterprise.? ?
The administrations of non-hazardous waste in urban areas is a bounden duty and the job of Local Government authorities. The Management and administration of hazardous waste material is the job of the generator subject to local and National Laws and regulations prevailing in such areas.?
?
Rapidly increasing urbanization and economic development is one reason to accumulate heaps of municipal solid waste. Most of the municipal councils still try to meet the challenge of preventing environmental degradation due to unsystematic solid-waste management. Open burning of solid waste, becomes a health hazard that needs to be addressed. Solid-waste management has become an important issue in all the municipal and other local authority areas of Sri Lanka. It needs to be resolved through an integrated community, private and industrial sector, with policy-based approach adapted by the Ministry of Local Government, with regard to all local authorities.? ?
Provisions in the National Environmental Act and their amendments and special regulations made by the minister of Environmental and Natural Resources especially refer to municipal solid waste. Municipal council ordinances and by - laws relating to Solid Waste Management are enacted for the inspection, supervision, segregation, storage, collection, discharge, transportation, processing, treatment and disposal of solid waste generated in private and public places. There are public health inspectors in the divisions to take legal action against illegal dumping and other violations. We do not know to what extent the prosecutions have been carried out against the violators of the Law.? ?
The primary objective of solid waste management should be to minimize and to eliminate the adverse impacts of waste material on human- health and the environment. If this objective is realized it will finally lead to economic development and a better quality of life of those who live in the said local authority areas. It is the responsibility of municipal councils to improve the environment for the good of the community. The improper management of solid waste gives rise to problems of health, sanitation, and environmental degradation.? ?
The following are a few methods of solid waste management.? ?
?
	Sanitary landfill ? This is the most popular solid waste disposal method. Garbage is basically spread out in thin layers compressed and covered with soil.? ?
	
	
	Incineration - This method involves burning of solid waste under high temperature until the wastes are turned in to ashes. The good side of this method is that it reduces the volume of waste drastically.? ?
	
	
	Recycling ? Identification of resources in the process of taking useful but discard items for the purpose of recycling.? ?
	
	
	Composting ? only biodegradable materials are used in composting. Good quality, environment- friendly manure is formed from compost and can be used in agriculture.? ?
	
A proper environmental regulatory framework has to be in place to maintain high standard of hygiene and measures to prevent and control air and water pollution, and to manage hazardous waste and municipal solid waste. Municipal councils need to balance environmental protection and economic development through collaborate relationship between the Central Environment Authority and the key economic development and promotional agencies within the municipal council areas.? ?
A systematized solid waste management is an integral part of environmental conservation that should be observed by the individual members of the community, corporate members and the municipalities. This will keep the environment clean and reduce health and settlement issues.? ?
The Ministry of Local Government has to develop a comprehensive garbage collection system islandwide and train the municipal and local authority officials by providing them with adequate training and infrastructure facilities to fine?tune the present systems adopted by the Municipal Councils.?
Author is the Chairman, Condominium Management Authority.? ?

Ranil saved MR from being branded a criminal: Mangala
	
Former president Mahinda Rajapaksa should light a lamp in honour of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe because it was he who saved MR from being branded as an international criminal, Finance and Mass Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera said.
He said it was the yahapalanaya government which prevented Sri Lanka from becoming a blotch in the world map.
The minister told a meeting of the UNP ?balamandalaya in Matara on Sunday and pointed out that Mr. Rajapaksa and his fellow travellers in the joint opposition had got the opportunity to insult, abuse and attack the government in the global arena because this government had restored democracy in Sri Lanka.
?No one must forget the pathetic situation that prevailed in Sri Lanka before 2015. Sri Lanka was black mark in the world map as a result of the actions of one family and one dictator. There were allegations of violations of International Humanitarian Law (IHL) judicial and media suppression, breakdown in the rule of law and human rights abuses. Sri Lanka was branded a ?pariah state? and the entire global community was against Sri Lanka,? he said. ?By the time, this government took office in January 2015, the UNHRC with the support of member countries had decided to initiate an international probe on Sri Lanka without our consent. One of the main tasks of the new government was to rebuild the confidence and respect on Sri Lanka among the global community.?
The minister said the rule by an oligarchy lost Sri Lanka the GSP+ and fish exports to the UE to Sri Lanka. "
The fuel price formula was introduce by the government to pass the benefit onto the consumer if there was a price drop in fuel in the global market. But unfortunately today we see the opposite of it. Mahinda Rajapaksa has not right to tale about fuel price formula because he did not bring down prices of fuel even after the Supreme Court ruled to that effect," he said. ?We must get ready for an election soon. There will be three in 2019. Those elections are as important as the elections in 2015. All UNPers must work harder and be determined to win all three polls for the UNP." (Sandun A Jayasekera)

## Title: Rupee Haemorrhage
## Section: Opinion
## Date: 1 October 2018 01:07 am
Rupee Haemorrhage
	
he falling Sri Lankan Rupee is now at the centre of discussions about the economy. Is this problem due to the US Dollar strengthening along with increasing interest rates in the United States? Is it a consequence of flawed trade policies that have maintained much higher levels of imports relative to exports? Or is it an outcome of opening our economy to the inflow and flight of finance capital? These debates, politically charged and partisan as they are, provide an important opening to evaluate the economic trajectory of the country.??
The rupee?s depreciation and related balance of payments problems ? characterized by lacking foreign exchange to pay for imports and foreign loans ? should not come as a surprise to anyone. Such crises have taken place repeatedly across the world, even in Sri Lanka, following liberalisation of trade and finance. The global proportions and the international consequences of such crises have been the subject of economic discussions for decades, particularly after the Asian Economic Crisis of 1997 and the Global Economic Crisis of 2008. Furthermore, developments in the international financial and goods markets, including the higher cost of capital with the trend of rising US interest rates and declining possibilities for exports with increasing protectionist moves by the US, have been known for years.? ?
?
Short-term analysis??
Crises bring out some hard truths. Politicians are forced to deal with ground realities, even as their ideologues hide, unwilling to take responsibility?for their policy projections. It is refreshing to hear the Government?s short-term analysis of the depreciation of the rupee: That the post-war boom in Sri Lanka was a consequence of capital flowing to the emerging markets after the 2008 global financial crisis. That the current crisis is a result of capital flying back to the metropolitan centres in the West. That it is a direct consequence of opening our markets to unsustainable imports. That the trade wars and sanctions are creating turmoil in the global goods and capital markets leading to the ?flight to safety? in the form of the strengthening dollar. And that depreciation of currencies is not unique to Sri Lanka but affecting many other countries, including in the region as with India and other parts of the world as with Argentina.? ?
?
Given such erudite analysis, why did we not see these problems coming? What steps did Sri Lankan policymakers take to address this eventuality? Why did they not restrict imports and implement mechanisms to slow capital flight? Instead, our neo-liberal ideologues waxed eloquently about trade liberalization and the value of creating an international financial centre. Discussing reductions to imports was taboo and mentioning import substitution was forbidden. While politicians are finally talking about restricting imports, some of their ideologues have gone silent, and others seem to accept the crisis and consequent suffering of people as inevitable, in their bid to push the economy further down the path of liberalisation.??
Corruption and FDI??
The economic policies since the open economy reforms of 1977 have locked Sri Lanka on the path of liberalization, particularly greater integration with the global capital and goods markets. The idea of a viable industrial policy and of replacing imports with local production have been rejected, as foreign aid for development has pushed for free market policies. Sadly, it was assumed that once the markets were freed, the economy will deliver.? ?
Corruption and insufficient Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) were viewed to be the problems, and, privatization, the solution to both. Ironically, experience from around the world shows that it is the process of privatization, supported by foreign investment that entices high levels of corruption. The recent allegations of the bond scandal with investment of EPF funds and the Rajapaksa regime?s deal with Chinese foreign investment stink of such economic processes that result in rent seeking. As in other parts of the world, FDI has mainly gone into speculative real estate investment in Sri Lanka, making little contribution to export growth, only strengthening the local financial and construction oligarchy, and flying out when prospects turn sour. So again, corruption is not the central problem and FDI will not solve our problems. The main challenge is industrial policy, specifically paucity of state support for production, if not for export, at least for domestic consumption.? ?
Bankrupt economic vision
The bigger issue is bankruptcy of economic vision. The most ridiculous proposal in recent years was to import 65,000 steel prefabricated houses for a whopping US$ 1 billion. Much time was wasted debating this project in parliament and the media, while housing for the war-affected has been delayed for over three years. That the country would even consider importing US$ 1 billion in unsuitable steel houses, which are more than double the cost of brick and mortar houses that have been locally constructed for generations, is reflective of the economic stupidity that is prevalent among sections of policymakers.? ?
The Government is finally waking up to restrict vehicle imports including luxury vehicles, but this is no time for complacency. It should be noted that Sri Lanka fails to produce a substantial portion of food for domestic consumption. With falling investment in agriculture, in 2017, US$ 1,841 million went towards food and beverage imports, and which seafood imports accounted for US$ 214 million in our island nation possessing an abundance of marine resources (Finance Ministry Annual Report 2017).? ?
Until recently, however, discussing food production to substitute for imports was off limits as neo-liberal economists obsessed about exports, rejected the importance of the agricultural sector, and even called for getting people off the land by creating a market for land. We are now paying the price for the wilful ignorance and ideological arrogance of neo-liberal think tanks and policy wonks. If we prescribed their own medicine of efficient and competitive markets regardless of devastating consequences, they should all be fired for failing to understand the workings and dynamics of markets.? ?
Road to hell
When it comes to economic policy direction, the road to hell is not paved with good intentions, but the coercive financial muscle and ideological arm twisting of global hegemons including the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Even as the Sri Lankan Government was talking about restricting imports and measures to address the exchange rate crisis, the IMF delegation, which left a few days ago, repeated its commands of liberalizing trade, a flexible exchange rate and austerity in the form of fiscal consolidation.? ?
It is budget season and the IMF?s message of fiscal cuts is a cynical twist of the facts about the twin deficits. The problem affecting Sri Lanka is its current account deficit, or simply put, our external account; that is, whether we have enough exports and remittances to pay for imports and foreign loans.? The budget deficit is about government finances; that is, whether the government has enough revenues to pay for its expenditure. The IMF and its cheerleaders conveniently overlook the difference between the following: foreign loans by the government that increase the current account deficit; and domestic loans by the government that may increase the budget deficit, but is need to stimulate an economy during times of business downturns and economic crisis. In fact, with the deteriorating economic situation and the rising cost of living, propelled by the falling rupee, the Government must restrict imports and invest more in the local economy towards providing stimulus and relief from the crisis. But the IMF, similar to its devastating policy prescriptions for Greece, is calling for the opposite: to further liberalize trade and restrict local investment by the Government.? ?
The international donor establishment including the IMF, World Bank and Asian Development Bank (ADB), alongside local think tanks supported by neo-liberal donor agencies, have a reason for their twisted logic.?
They could care less about the economic suffering of the people, and, in fact, would use the economically-weak position of the Government to advocate for further shrinking the state by cutting state services, privatization and greater integration with the global markets, all so that the country could be further exploited by global finance capital.??
Alternatives to consider
Neo-liberal globalization since the 1980s was never a natural or inevitable process. Rather it was a conscious ideological project backed with tremendous global political and economic power, whereby institutions like the IMF and World Bank pried open markets in developing economies towards the flow of goods and finance capital. They used the most vulnerable economic and political situations in Third World countries to pressurise and leverage them with their programs of ?structural adjustment?, which were loans and finances in return for neo-liberal economic structural changes. That project is far from over and Sri Lanka?s current vulnerable moment will also be seen as an opportunity to further the agenda of free markets and privatization.? ?
We need to urgently redirect the economy towards strengthening local production, and reverse the direction of trade and financial liberalization. The Government is finally taking measures to restrict imports. The Government also seems to have realised, even at this late stage, that it is the flight of capital to Western financial centres that has hammered the rupee.?
The Government must think of the longer term and dump its trade liberalization agenda. The ADB and the World Bank have provided over US$ 300 million in loans to build the international financial centre, expand the capital markets and integrate Sri Lanka deeper into the global capital markets. Sometimes it is important for a government to say no thanks to the donors, and save everyone the trouble of a deeper economic crisis in the future.??
?There has been some work on restricting speculation and fluctuations in the global currency markets by placing a larger tax on currency transactions, known as the Tobin tax. Similar taxes on capital inflows and flights, a much larger capital gains tax, and greater restrictions on imports through tariffs, are all needed in these times of crises. But first, those who repeat the mantra of free markets should shut up!?

Soft skills matter ? Jim Garrison, Founder & President, Ubiquity University
	
A recent study in the United States shows that 93% of employees consider soft skills as, if not more, important than hard skills. A Human Capital Survey by Deloitte indicates that the top mega trend in the US since 2016 is building highly empowered soft skill teams. In a world of escalating hyper-complexity and competition, soft skills matter. Who you are becomes as important as what you know. Companies that understand this and hire people who work well with others are gaining the competitive edge.?
What are soft skills? They are a bit hard to define but they are generally considered to include creativity, collaboration, leadership, critical thinking, emotional intelligence, cross boundary team building, global thinking, whole system thinking, innovation, entrepreneurship. What makes them challenging to specifically define is that they have more to do with a person?s interior, with how they feel, how they react to circumstances, how they perform in teams, what they value.?
Hard skills are easy. They are basically about what you know. They comprise the world of science, technology, engineering, mathematics, physics, chemistry, etc. They are about building bridges, running airports, developing computer programs, figuring out economic data and trends. Hard skills are used to produce most of the products companies make, market and distribute. They are about the external world.
But the challenge companies face is how to manage people. People are full of emotions, fears, passions, hopes, and are often driven by internal drives they themselves do not fully understand. You may know how to program a computer, but you may not know how to work well in the team building the computer. You may know how to fly an airplane but you may not know how to deal with unruly passengers. You may know the right answer but you may not know how to manage your boss. This is where soft skills come in. They are about people, not facts.?
Bottom line for companies: having a well motivated, flexible and happy work force, interacting creatively, harmoniously and resiliently with each other and the customer increases productivity, market share, and profitability. The companies that can integrate hard skills with soft skills, High Tech with High Touch, will have the winning combination.?
That is why new projects such as the recently announced partnership between ESOFT and Ubiquity University are so timely and so important for Sri Lankan youth. By leveraging ESOFT?s experience in technical skills and combining this with Ubiquity?s expertise in holistic education and soft skills development, this partnership will enable Sri Lankan students to develop critical competencies in leadership, critical thinking, creativity, collaboration, emotional intelligence, cross boundary team building, resilience and global thinking. These competencies will give them the complete package of skills they need to succeed in the competitive, ever-changing job market of the day.

Sri Lanka Launches First Social Impact Funds
	
Two Memoranda of Understanding were signed today in New York, launching Sri Lanka?s first social impact funds aimed at supporting social entrepreneurs access innovative financing, to help achieve the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.
The signings were witnessed by Hon. Tilak Marapana, Minister of Foreign Affairs, Government of Sri Lanka, and Mr. Achim Steiner, UNDP Administrator, at a special side event, atthe 73rd session of the United Nations General Assembly.
The two MoU?s - one for a US$ 5Mn Social Enterprise Fund (SEF) and one for a US$ 20Mn Social Impact Capital Fund (SICF) - were signed by Mr. Chandula Abeywickrema and Mr. Deshan Pushparajah respectively, and by Mr. Haoliang Xu, Assistant Administrator and Director of UNDP?s Regional Bureau for Asia and Pacific.?
The Sustainable Development Goals are aimed at ending poverty, protecting the planet and ensuring peace and prosperity for all, by 2030. Achieving the goals however, will require a massive amount of resources. The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) estimates the sustainable development goals will cost between US$5 - US$7 trillion, with a funding gap of about US$2.5 trillion in developing countries.
Given these global and national pressures on funding, Sri Lanka is keen to explore alternative and innovative means of financing, particularly by leveraging the private sector, to help meet the SDGs. Given that micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) form the backbone of the Sri Lankan economy, and the country?s growing awareness and interest in impact investing and social entrepreneurship, impact funds were identified as a means of mobilizing funding for the SDGs in Sri Lanka.
?In order to address this, the Lanka Impact Investing Network and Tempest P E Partners (a member of the Capital Alliance Group), in collaboration with UNDP, pioneered Sri Lanka?s first social impact funds.
?UNDP is committed to helping countries to achieve the SDGS. These social impact funds will play a key role in that mission, by supporting social entrepreneurship in Sri Lanka,? said Haoliang Xu, UN Assistant Secretary-General, and Director of UNDP's Regional Bureau for Asia and the Pacific. ?Together with the establishment of the funds, UNDP is committed to supporting Sri Lanka further leverage innovating financing models to realize the vision of a sustainable future by 2030.?
The Social Enterprise Fund (SEF) will cater mostly to successfully incubated, commercially viable, micro and small social enterprises with capital requirements of less than USD 100,000. In addition to capital, the fund will also provide targeted technical and capacity development support through mentorship, business support and training. The Social Impact Capital Fund (SICF) will support inclusive and responsible businesses that integrate and promote social impact, as a part of their business models. The SICF?s investments will be larger, in excess of USD 100,000.? UNDP will be responsible for impact measurement and management of the projects for both funds, to ensure they are well aligned with the SDGs and achieve significant social impact.
Speaking about the initiative, the Founder and Chairman of Lanka Impact Investing Network, Mr. ChandulaAbeywickrema said, ?Lanka Impact Investing Network (LIIN) has taken a number of pioneering initiatives to create a social entrepreneurship ecosystem and to build the impact investing landscape in Sri Lanka to drive the culture of entrepreneurship.?
The Chief Executive Officer of Capital Alliance Group, Mr. Ajith Fernando added, ?We are pleased to be partnering with Lanka Impact Investing Network and UNDP in this timely push to develop an impact investment franchise. We are strong believers that given an enabling environment, sustainable & profitable solutions for the social problems of our day can and will come from the private sector.??

?had to keep my fingers crossed whether this, the article can actually bring about a change for better for children.
A report released by UNICEF recently, titled Keeping children safe and empowered online: A study on Sri Lanka?s digital landscape, indicated that 46.3% of some 5,000 children polled had communicated with strangers online, over 15% shared their private information with strangers, while 28% had met them in person, 18.3% of whom had done so without informing family or friends.
The report indicated that around 27.9% of children online had physically met people that they had first met online. Another 25.2% of online-IT users anticipated meeting in person in the future.
This user group was composed of more boys than girls.
Although the study did not probe deeper into the ages of those individuals that the children had met up with, most of those, who reported having met someone indicated that these people fell into the category of someone they had befriended, or someone related to a job offer or social activity, like a club or organization, rather than a person for a prospective romantic relationship of the children, who had physically met online-strangers, 18.3% boys and girls had done so without informing anyone, and another 36.3% had only informed a friend, underscoring the degree of risk these user children were being exposed to.
According to the report, a substantial proportion of children with interest access are engaged in what it calls risky behaviour. Exacerbating this is an alarming lack of awareness with respect to privacy.
Nearly one in four boys and one in three girls were not at all aware of privacy settings for their online accounts. Around, 8% does not know how to change privacy settings.
?
"Though this study did not look into the type of strangers that children interacted with or the nature of their interactions, these types of behaviour can expose children to sexual predators or harmful online communities"
?
However, there was another group of online-users, 32.2% of boys and 33.1% of girls, who were aware of privacy settings, but did not want to set them up. All these children are exposed to potential online threats.
One in ten children (A considerably higher percentage of boys) admitted that they had sent/uploaded content inappropriate for their age, which included photos and videos.
The proportion of such children increased slightly from Grades 6-9 to the advanced level, but the percentage of girls remained low throughout (about 3%).
Forty per cent of the online children polled has admitted to sharing photos including personal photos as well as personal information with strangers, in addition to accepting chat requests from people they but not encounter before.
?Though this study did not look into the type of strangers that children interacted with, or the nature of their interactions, these types of behaviour can expose children to sexual predators or harmful online communities.
?These interactions captured above could have been between children or adults, but this was not verified in this research. Furthermore, children admitted to sharing their own photos with strangers.?
These findings are in line with the harmful and often illegal online activities described in the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) guideline,? said the report.
The study also reveals that some children have a tendency to engage in unethical behaviour online.
?Nearly a quarter of online IT users admitted to inappropriate conduct such as lying, sharing false information, sending messages that could hurt someone else, or admitted to using others passwords to log into their accounts. Such activities constituted unethical and unlawful behaviour.?
Among the 11-18 year age group, 67.6% of the boys polled were online, while only 33.1% of girls had access to the internet. Regional variances, as highlighted in the report, show that 67.8% of respondents from urban areas were online users, compared to 47.1% from rural locations and just 39.3% from plantation areas.
?
"Children are an invaluable asset to a nation, unfortunately, the incidents referred to above demonstrate that we are unable to protect that asset. The beautiful world of the child is enveloped by dark clouds created by strangers"
A majority of children are getting online without adult supervision. According to the study, 53.6% of child internet users were ?self-taught? about the internet, compared to the 16.5% who had been taught by their parents.
With an estimated 6.7 million internet users in Sri Lanka in 2018 representing 32% of the total population, a rise from 4 million in 2015, internet usage is growing across all age groups.
Yet, whilst 28.3% of people in Sri Lanka are Computer Literate, this differs substantially by age, rising to 60.7% of 15-19-year-olds compared to just 19.9% of 40-49-year-olds.
This represents a rise in over-all computer literacy, across all age groups since the report data was collected in 2015.?
Children are an invaluable asset to a nation, unfortunately, the incidents referred to above demonstrate that we are unable to protect that asset. The beautiful world of the child is enveloped by dark clouds created by strangers.

Today is World Children?s Day: Things to ponder
	
?
dvancement in science and technology has made a tremendous impact on human welfare. It has helped develop the world to near perfection, with instant comforts.
Nevertheless, people are not as happy as they should be. Their worries escalate on a daily basis and they end up with a state of depression.
This is the status of most of the Sri Lankans. Depression will be the second leading cause of death in 2020. What can we do for this?
To a greater extent, this is due to globalisation and modernisation, but are these the only causes?
The root of the problem may be the way the children are brought up in life. Petting them too much during their childhood may be a reason for this crisis.
This is one aspect of my article and the other is that the present status of children not speaking in their mother tongue, disrespecting their parents, teachers, elders, religion and culture.
What a pity? What can we do?
Parents play a pivotal role in upbringing their children. They must act as their role models. They should mould their children to be good citizens of our Motherland.
But, the fact is that nowadays both parents are working and the children are at the daycare centres or parents do not have sufficient time to spend with their children.
In some cases, children isolate themselves and engrossed in playing TV games or watching movies.
Here the addiction starts too early in life. As a result, they do not perform well at studies and they leave their schools as failures.
?
"While praying with children do not ask for wealth, power or fame as these stress builders "
This trend continues in their adulthood as well. When they enter into adulthood most of them get addicted to cigarette smoking and alcohol.
Should not we take corrective action now? It is not too late.
The parents should pet their children fully up to first three years. Thereafter they should reduce petting and focus on Children?s education gradually.
Parents should endeavour to make their children obedient to them. They should instil the family values in their children?s mind.
Teachers should treat all students equally including the students at the back benches.
Since this group of students are highly vulnerable to mischievous acts proper coaching and guidance must be given to them in order to make them studious. Teachers too play a pivotal role in the future of these students.
?
Managing time wisely to avoid stress and improve productivity?
This means the time has to be utilized effectively and efficiently. The utilisation of time by individuals could be broadly categorised into time investment (studying, working), time spent (Traveling, talking) and time wastage (Idling, gossiping).
Hence, you must invest more time in good deeds, reduce the unnecessary time spent and avoid wastage of time.
In order to do this, you should have objectives and goals in your life. Your objectives have to be realistic ones which need to be SMART.
They have to be Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Related and Timely. When you have clear objectives for your life you have less time to worry or to be depressed.
If you want to be happier, then you should have a holistic approach to your life.
In order to do this, you should focus on your personal life, family life, work life, social life, community life and spiritual life.
When your children too follow this most of the problems outlined earlier will disappear.?
Particularly, you should strike a balance between your family life and work life.
The above will lead the way to increased productivity. Simultaneously, the national productivity will also increase.
?
"The utilisation of time by individuals could be broadly categorised into time investment (studying, working), time spent (Traveling, talking) and time wastage (Idling, gossiping)"
?
Implicit faith in God?
With regard to children neglecting their religion, you should set an example to them.
You should pray daily with your family at home and at least visit sacred institutions once a week with your family.
When praying please do not ask for wealth, power or fame as these are stress builders even though you acquire those.
Instead pray for serenity, peace and love. When you acquire these you will also get wealth.
Neglect of religion, and Sinhala and Tamil languages in International Schools
Since nowadays you get International Schools everywhere we need to be vigilant on children obtaining lessons in religion as the International Schools do not have religion as a subject.
Further, there are only one or two classes per week allocated for Sinhala or Tamil languages.
Parents cannot do much about it. Hence, the Government should intervene promptly to safeguard our religion, culture, tradition and languages besides our national identity.
Conquering depression?
In life sometimes we get what we want immediately, sometimes there will be a delay in getting what we want, sometimes we may not get what we aimed for and sometimes we gain unexpectedly.
All these are part and parcel of our life. We should accept this wholeheartedly. For example, if you pedal a push bicycle it will move simultaneously. Action and result are seen at the same time. If you throw a rubber ball at the wall it will bounce to your hands within a few seconds. Here, relatively a delay is seen in the result.
But if you plant a seed now and you have waited patiently for years to the fruits. Hence, if we do not get results immediately, there is no need to get panic or stressed out.
Rather you focus only on the action and expect the benefits.
Should it be yours, it will come to you. Otherwise, you need to strive and struggle in fulfilling new expectations. By having this mindset you can easily avoid stress or depression.
Remember we need to have a certain amount of stress to propel in action.
Whilst appreciate the Government?s move to set up more counselling centres in hospitals I humbly request the leaders to consider to include the strategies to Primary Prevention of Depression.
?
"This is the status of most of the Sri Lankans. Depression will be the second leading cause of death in 2020. What can we do for this?"
?
Change with the Change
Finally, we need to change with the change. Do not resist change. Changes could happen in the school, at workplace, society or country at large.
If we want to be in the first place, we must change. The change means growth. The change means prosperity. Teach these lessons in life to your children.
We can best pay our own debt to our motherland by building a better future for generations on the framework our forebears established.
Today, we as Sri Lankans can act as good ancestors by linking our ideal of service with the generations to come. Let us get together and work to build the future with
Vision and action
Let us make our children as tomorrow?s leaders. I take this opportunity to wish all our children a very happy children?s day. May God bless you and your families.

## Title: 15 % train fare hike not on previous fare but on fare per kilometer: Railway dep.

15 % train fare hike not on previous fare but on fare per kilometer: Railway dep.
	
Clearing the confusion prevailing among the train commuters with regard to the train-fare revision from today, Railways Deputy Commercial Superintendent N.J. Indipola said the 15 per cent increase was based on the train fare per kilometre and not on the current fare.
?The previous fare charged per kilometer was Rs.4.20 for the first class, Rs.2.30 for second class and Rs.1.30 for a third class. The 15 per cent increase has been calculated based on this fare for the three classes. If the fare when calculated, for example comes to between Rs.10.50 and Rs.14.50 it will be rounded up to Rs.15,? he said.
He said the fares have been rounded up to avoid the issuance of small change.
When asked if it was unfair for the commuters, he said the same procedure was adopted even when the prices were last reviewed in 2008.
?If the fare includes a figure with cents, it creates issues for both commuters and railway officials,? he said.
When asked about the issuance of the train tickets at the previous prices, Mr. Indipola said they would be issued until the old stocks lasted.
Train commuters complained that their train fares had been increased by more than 15 per cent despite the media reports that the fare would be increased by 15 per cent. (Ajith Siriwardana and Darshana Sanjeewa)
