Uva to ban teachers using mobiles in school
	
	The Uva Chief Minister has made a move to ban the use of mobile phones by teachers during school hours.
	Uva Province Chief Minister Chamara Sampath Dassanayake said yesterday that teachers would be instructed to switch off their mobile phones and place them at the Principal?s office during school hours.
	He said a new circular would be issued and sent to the zonal education offices.
	The new rule would be in effect from January 2016, he said.
	?The use of phones had reduced productivity in the schools apart from other issues like pictures being taken without permission. Therefore we have directed the phones be left at the Principal?s office during the day and if there is an emergency the principal or the school can be contacted,? Dassanayake said.
	Taking it a step further, the Chief Minister said the regulations on mobile phone use would be strictly regulated.
	?Students who do not follow this rule will be dismissed, while teachers will be transferred,? the Chief Minister said.(Darshana Sanjeewa)

	Some people were trying to spread false rumours that the last rites of the Ven. Maduluwawe Sobitha Thera were not being conducted according to the Thera?s last wishes, said the Maha Sanghanayaka of Sri Jayawardenapura, the Ven. Meegahatenne Chandrasiri Thera.
	He told the media today that the Ven Sobitha Thera had not described in writing how he would like his funeral to be conducted, though he had made certain remarks regarding the subject in his sermons from time to time.
	?Some people are trying to sling mud at the government by saying that it is organising a full scale state funeral, whereas the thera?s wish was that he should be buried within 24 hours. If that were the case, the funeral should have been held in Singapore.
	?But since there was no written record of his wishes, we, his colleagues and disciples, had to decide how it should be conducted,? he said.
	Local Government Minister Karunaratne Paranavithana said that, considering the Thera?s significant contribution towards creating a just society, the government had decided to conduct his funeral with full state honours. (Kurulu Koojana Kariyakarawana)
