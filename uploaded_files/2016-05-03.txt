Boat carrying SL asylum seekers arrives in Cocos Islands
	
A boat carrying Sri Lankan asylum seekers has arrived within the Cocos Islands, according to locals, who say the vessel approached on Monday morning in bad weather.
It's the first asylum seeker boat reported to have arrived in Australia in nearly two years.
The thinly populated chain of islands and coral atolls located mid-way between the mainland and Sri Lanka is a territory of Australia.
Local Awie Rasa told Hack he saw the 10-11m wooden boat coming through the passage of the entrance to the main lagoon between the two largest islands about 10:45am.
"It's moving pretty fast, moving 12-15 knots," he told Hack.
"It's heading towards Home Island."
Mr Rasa was taking a ferry from Home Island, which is the most populous, to the capital on West Island.
"When we got to West Island jetty I can see police are preparing for their job. The customs on the jetty are running up and down and getting their tenders into the water."
"I heard it didn't reach Home Island, just anchorage around about 500m away from Home Island.
"That's pretty close."
He said he had worked as a skipper escorting asylum seeker vessels until last year and he believed "the yellow and light blue" boat was Sri Lankan.
"They?ve got the same colour boat - they're all coloured the same."
He believes there were 12 people on board.
Another local man told Hack he saw the boat from shore when it was "well and truly inside the lagoon".
He said the Australian Federal Police then escorted the boat to a mooring and two Border Force launches "appeared at great speed over the horizon".
He said the suspected Sri Lankan asylum seekers were then taken to a Border Force vessel.
"We've had a significant presence [of] Navy and Customs guys for many months. They come, they go, they disappear for a few days and come back," he said.
"As far as vessels reaching the lagoon and getting inside the lagoon ? that's certainly the closest one that's got in for some time."
A Border Force spokesperson said the Department would not comment on operational matters.
The last asylum seeker boat reported to arrive in Australia was a vessel of 157 people intercepted in July 2014 near Christmas Island.
The people from that vessel spent a month on a Customs ship before being transferred to the Curtin Detention Centre and then Nauru in mid-2014.(ABC)

CSN lawyer faults FCID action
	
Attorney Premanath Dolawatta appearing for Carlton Sports Network (CSN), in the money laundering case,said today the Financial Crimes Investigations Division (FCID) was obtaining legal recognition by seeking Court orders on the ongoing investigation.
?According to normal procedure, the FCID summons the suspects if they were required to give a statement on the allegations. But, now the FCID is seeking court orders to direct the suspects to give statements.
The motive is obvious. As we know the matter regarding the legal recognition of the FCID is being argued in the Supreme Court. By getting court orders to summon the suspects, the FCID will be able to use the court orders in future to show that the institute has worked in a legal manner,? he claimed.

Gammanpila is a parasite: Mervyn
	
Former minister Mervyn Silva today lashed out at MP Udaya Gammanpila over his remarks that Mr. Silva was responsible for the downfall of former president Mahinda Rajapaksa and called Mr. Gammanpila a parasite.
Mr. Gammanpila is reported to have told a news conference that the behaviour of the twosome Mr. Silva and former MP Sajin de Vass Gunawardena had led to Mr. Rajapaksa's defeat at last year's presidential election.
?It?s not me who collected money from people and I don?t have corruption charges against me. Their allegation is that I had tied a Samurdhi Officer to a tree. I have already given answers to this allegation. I didn?t do it. Had I done it, it would have been for the people?s protection from dengue and not for my personal gain,? Mr. Silva told a news conference held at his residence.
He said even kings were known to have tied the accused to make a better country. ?In Saudia Arabia, they cut off the hands of those who steal to prevent thievery,? he said.
Mr. Silva said the joint opposition should have hired a street poet instead of Mr. Gammanpila to hold news conferences.
He said Mr. Gammanpila had also accused him of conspiring to defeat Mr. Rajapaksa some two years ago. ?There was no conspiracy but I supported them. I couldn?t pledge support since my son was put in jail by Gotabaya Rajapaksa after concocting a case against him,? he said.

Gayantha condemns JO members? actions
	
The Parliamentary sittings were suspended today due to the unruly behaviour of members of the joint opposition, Mass Media Minister Gayantha Karunathilake said.
?While Field Marshal and Minister Sarath Fonseka was speaking in parliament of Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa?s security, the Joint opposition members could not bear to listen to his comments. That is why they misbehaved,? the minister said.
?Unfortunately UNP MP Sandith Samarasinghe was admitted to the General Hospital after he suffered face and head injuries after he was attacked by members of the joint opposition,? he said.
?This shows their true nature. Even when they were in power they wouldn?t listen to the views of the opposition and misbehaved if they were criticised,? he said.
?We request Speaker Karu Jayasuriya to conduct an investigation as soon as possible and take action against the culprits.
?A committee headed by the deputy Speaker has been appointed in parliament to investigate the incident by observing the Parliament CCTV?s video footage.
?A special report had been requested from the committee by the Speaker.
?We are looking forward to make the parliament environment free of such incidents in the future,? he said. (Chaturanga Pradeep)

His love for the car sours his public relations!
	
?
Some people are so fond of their vehicle, they take meticulous care to prevent even a fender bender happening to it. There is a senior Minister hailing from Wayamba, who is one of such people crazy about the vehicle he uses.
?
Large crowds visit his residence in his home town on the Public Day set apart by him and the purohita invariably keeps a watchful eye on his car parked opposite the residence on such Days, while listening to the problems of the people calling on him. And if he notices anyone leaning against his car, he would immediately get up and call out: ?Malli, please don?t lean against the car!?
Some people openly wonder why the purohita does not garage his vehicle or park it in a safe place, if he is so fond of it!

The white collar bigwig placed a Merc and a van belonging to the establishment at the disposal of the holiday makers to go places in comfort. He also had made it a point to fix new tires to the Merc at a cost of Rs.195, 000 before releasing it for the use of the privileged holiday-makers.?

Media secretary to be removed
	
The government has decided to remove Nimal Bopage from the post of Secretary of the Ministry of Parliamentary reforms and Mass media.
This decision had been arrived at after considering the impact of a statement made by the secretary on the media policy of the government of good governance, and acting in contravention of the efforts of President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe to establish an independent media environment by issuing such statements.
The statement under the title ? Uthum vu Madhya Nidahasa, Awabhavitha Nokaramu? issued by Mr. Bopage drew much attention of the government, prompting the Premier to summon Bopage and severely reprimand him.
Bopage soon after assuming duties had issued this controversial statement which had belittled the Yahapalana government and the senior Cabinet Ministers had expressed their serious concern, and the decision to remove him from the post had been taken thereafter.
The directive removing the secretary is expected to be forwarded to President Maithripala Sirisena within the next few days. (Anjula Maheeka Weerarathne)
