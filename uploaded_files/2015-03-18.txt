Singapore dismisses Lee Kuan Yew death report as hoax
	
A top government spokesman dismissed as a hoax Wednesday a report that Singapore's founding father had died, CNN reported.
Former Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew is alive, said Farah Rahim, senior director for the Singapore Ministry of Communications and Information. The 91-year-old is in critical condition, the government has said.
A message purporting to be from the current Prime Minister circulated online saying that Lee had died.
"We have reported this to the police and they are investigating this hoax. Our website was not hacked, it was a doctored image," the spokesman said.
Meanwhile, The Straits Times reported that the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) was lodging a police report about a fake website bearing the PMO logo and announcing the death of former Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew.
It said screenshots of the website started circulating on Wednesday night, leading some foreign media outlets to carry reports of Mr Lee's death, only to retract them later.
The Straits Times checked with the PMO, which said no new information has been issued since an update on Wednesday afternoon that Mr Lee was critically ill.

UNHRC chief due in June
	
	UN Human Rights Commissioner Prince Zeid bin ?Ra?ad, will visit Sri Lanka in June this year, Foreign Affairs Minister Mangala Samaraweera informed Parliament.
Mr. Samaraweera said this visit was in line with the UNHRC?s new focus on Sri Lanka. He also said Sri Lankan forces were slated to play a greater role in the UN?s peace keeping activities in the future.
Mr. Samaraweera said it was necessary to clear the reputation of the Sri Lankan armed forces and to take action against the few members of the armed forces who had acted in such a manner as to tarnish the good name of the armed forces.
He said it was important to have a domestic mechanism to look into human rights violations as pledged by the present regime prior to the presidential election. He said, ?Failure to carry out a domestic investigation will lead to an international investigation which might in turn lead to foreign intervention.??
?One must not treat the upholding of human rights as a western value. It should be treated as a universal value,? he said.
Criticising the drawbacks of the previous regime, the minister said the former administration had terminated ties with Sri Lanka?s traditional partners. He said the present regime would renew its ties with these partners in its effort to turn Sri Lanka into modern democratic state.(Yohan Perera)

Waiting for the nod from the new Boss for their own Govt
	
	After the April 23 D-day what? This is the main question being asked in political circles and in the corridors of politcal power these days. Both the Greens and the Reds of the new left have taken up the stance that the 100-day mandate given to the new government at the January 8 Presidential poll expires by April 23 and the government has no moral right to continure in office any longer.
However, the Blues now sitting in the opposition are coming up with many reasons to justify that the Maithri regime should continue in office beyond the self-imposed April 23 deadline. They insist on bringing about electoral reforms as a concommitant to pruning powers of the Executive Presidency. They also call for the formation of a national government as a continuance of the present regime. However, there are a few Blue Diyawanna members like ?Fieldvillage? who openly oppose the idea of a national government.
Meanwhile, the Green bigwigs have proposed that the entire Cabinet should resign if the Parliament is not dissolved by April 23. This proposal has been sweet music to certain Blue heavyweights now languishing in the opposition after years of tasting the nectar of power. ?That would be fine. If they resign en bloc, we can form a giovernment of our own to rule for the balance two year term. In such an event it would not be difficult to entice one or two Green members as well if need be,? a Blue front-liner had said. ?
The Blue stalwarts are said to be now quietly setting the stage to get the green light? for the proposal from the new Big Boss.

Charges against Cabraal not probed: Harsha
	
Not a single allegation levelled against former Central Bank Governor Ajith Nivard Cabraal had been investigated so far, Deputy Minister Harsha de Silva said today.
He said however, the incumbent CB Governor?s decision to have taken leave till the investigation into the CB bond issue was completed was a positive aspect of ?Yahapalanaya?
Dr. De Silva said the Governor could not be removed temporarily and thus his decision to go on leave was the next best thing to do.
?The former CB Governor was blamed for several irregularities such as investments made in loss-making institutions by misusing the Employees Provident Fund, but no action was taken against him. Parliament will decide on the fate of the incumbent Governor based on the report of the Committee appointed by the Prime Minister to investigate the CB bond issue,? he told a news conference.

	?This was one of the most inhumane acts carried out by a person holding public office. According to the complaint the offence committed by Mr. Silva was a violation of the Criminal Code and Sri Lanka?s Constitution because it is only a police or a judicial officer who can arrest or detain a citizen of the country,? the complainant told Daily Mirror. ?I was living abroad all these years and prior to my departure I had spearheaded public interest litigation. Upon my arrival I found that there had been no proceedings instituted by the Police or any other state agencies against this act and the person who had carried out, therefore I decided to lodge a criminal complaint against Mervyn Silva,? he said.
	Prof. Gunasekara said if the police did not investigate his complaint he would not hesitate to institute legal proceedings in Court against the notorious minister.( Hafeel Farisz and Darshana Sanjeewa)

Elections after reforms: President
	
President Maithripala Sirisena said today Parliament would be dissolved and a general election held after the proposed constitutional reforms were enacted.
He gave this assurance during a breakfast meeting at the president?s house with newspaper editors and media institution heads when asked whether Parliament would be dissolved on April 23.
The President said the date of elections would be decided no sooner the constitutional reforms were enacted. He said a general election would be definitely held because it was one of the main pledges given to the people during the presidential election campaign.
The President said the constitutional reforms would be finalised in about two weeks and would be presented to Parliament in April. He said the people and civil society groups would be given the opportunity to discuss the proposed reforms.
The President said views were being expressed that he was preventing the executive presidential powers being pruned. He said there was no truth in such views and that he himself had proposed that the term of the presidency be reduced to five years from the present six and the term of the Parliament be reduced to five years as well.
?
The President said excessive powers invested in the President especially through the 18th Amendment would be removed including the Presidential power to dissolve Parliament.
When asked about the electoral reforms he said it would be discussed within the next few weeks and underscored the fact that the new electoral system would be a mixed system and would do away with preferential voting.
However, he added that there were discussions and different opinions being expressed with regard to the number selected on the first-past-the-post system and through the proportional representation system.
The President said views were being expressed whether those selected on the proportional representation system should be at the national level or the district level and different views on the composition of the national list.
The president said he wants to form a national government for at least two years after the general election and therefore the campaigning should be carried out in a way that would lead to such a government.
When asked as to whether he would lead the SLFP campaign as its chairman, President Maitripala Sirisena said he would not participate at primary level campaigning at the election and highlighted the fact that he was also grateful to the UNP voters who voted for him and helped elect him as President.

Gemunu Avatar expected to be back in his element!
	
	Doctor Vermin ? self-styled Avatar of King Dutugemunu strode the political scene like a Colossus when he was once a close confidant and a favourite of the deposed Big Boss. However, the doctor fell from his Master?s grace when the Master himself was about to fall from power. And soon after the Master was deposed, he gathered enough courage to make serious allegations against the members of the former royal family.
Incidentally, Doctor Vermin and his ilk in the previous regime were the butt of acid criticism by most main speakers at the propaganda rallies held in support of the Compassionate One who was in the fray as the common opposition candidate. Therefore, many people thought that Gemunu Avatar was about to end up in the political dust bin. However, according to a latest report, Vermin has bounced back into political centre-stage with the necessary clout to continue with his usual shenanigans. The new Big Boss has nominated him to the powerful Central Committee of the party! There is yet another surprise! The heroin kingpin from Negombo who wrangled with Ranja too has got a similar appointment from the benevolent new Big Boss, they say.
These two appointments have a set a poser in particular to the loyalists of the deposed Big Boss who think there is more to it than meets the eye.

She did not conceal her anger when she was told that the ?motley group? in the opposition was going round the country drumming up support for the deposed Big Boss as the Prime Ministerial candidate.
The dowager also inquired about the perks and privileges already afforded to the deposed Big Boss for his comfort and security and what she learnt made her angrier still. She called a bigwig of the main Secretariat and vented her anger on him.
?Why did you assign such a big security detail to him?? How is that you assigned more people than I was given when I retired?? she had asked.? The highly disconcerted official listened to the harangue, but hazarded no reply, they say.

Port city filing continues to prevent erosion
	
The work on the Port City Project had been suspended but the filling of reclaimed lands is continuing on the request of the Chinese contractor to prevent sea erosion during the monsoon, Ports, Shipping and Aviation Minister Arjuna Ranatunga said today.
He told journalist that a final decision on the project would be taken based on the report of the committee investigating the details of the controversial project.
?There are a few vital issues to be addressed such as the environment impact and the feasibility of the project. Unfortunately the previous government has looked into the impact from this project and we cannot proceed till we address those issues. The contractor -- Chinese Communication Construction Company (CCCC) is aware of our concern and the reason for suspension of the work,? the minister said.
He said the project was launched just on the whims of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa who was reported to have said, ?I want an island here? without checking the Environment Impact Assessment or Feasibility.
?We will revisit the entire project, redraw the plans if necessary and attend to all issues raised by many groups before restarting the construction work on the full agreement of the CCCC,? he said.
Commenting on the Mattala International Airport (MIA) the minister said his ministry would be in trouble if the government failed to find an investor for the MIA because some Rs.250 million is needed monthly for its maintenance. The Ports, shipping and Aviation Ministry expects to offer its facilities for use by a local or foreign investor. However, the airport will not be closed.
?We are considering the possibility of merging the national carrier SriLankan and the loss-making budget airline Mihin Lanka, but a final decision will be taken after the final report of the three-member committee headed by J.C Weliamuna is received on March 31,? the minister said.
Nearly 150 out of the 400 employed at the MIA have been transferred to the Bandaranaike International Airport to cut down on the losses at MIA. (Sandun A Jayasekera)

President allows singing of National Anthem in Tamil- Mano
	
In a major reconciliatory move, President Mathripala Sirisena will be sending a circular to all institutions saying that there is no bar on singing the Lankan national anthem in Tamil.
He will thus be lifting an unofficial ban existing since 2010, when President Mahinda Rajapaksa let it be known that government will frown on singing the anthem in Tamil. Schools and other institutions, which were using the Tamil version of ?Sri Lanka Matha, Apa Sri Lanka? since 1951, stopped doing so.
Sirisena announced his decision to lift the language bar when the leader of the Democratic Peoples? Front (DPF), Mano Ganeshan, raised the issue at the National Executive Council (NEC) meeting on Tuesday. ?
?The President said that he would send a circular saying that there is no ban on singing the national anthem in Tamil. He also said that he would have the matter cleared by the National Security Council,? Ganeshan has told the New Indian Express.
It was in 1951 that newly independent Lanka adopted Shantiniketan-trained Ananda Samarakoon?s? Sinhalese-language song? ?Sri Lanka Matha,? Apa Sri Lanka? as the national anthem. Simultaneously, a Tamil version, ?Sri Lanka Thaaye Nam Sri Lanka?, composed by the Lankan Tamil poet, M.Nallathambi, was also adopted. For decades, both versions were sung, although only the Sinhalese version had constitutional sanction.? ?
But the victory of the Lankan armed forces over the Tamil Tigers in 2009, resulted in Sinhalese-nationalist parties like the National Freedom Front (NFF) and the Jathika Hela Urumaya (JHU) demanding a ban on the Tamil version on the ground that countries sanction use of only one language for singing the national anthem.
On December 12, 2010, Home Minister W.D.John Senewiratne introduced a cabinet paper to officially disallow singing the anthem in Tamil. President Rajapaksa, who headed the cabinet, did not officially commit himself to Senewiratne?s proposal, but word went around that his government did not favor the use of the Tamil version. In the Tamil areas, the Security Forces insisted on the use of the Sinhalese version only. The Tamils? argument that in several countries, including Canada and South Africa, the anthem is sung in different languages fell on deaf ears.

	Setting up of an international Sports Training school somewhere close to his home turf had been a long cherished plan of the former Sports Chief at the Cabinet level. At long last, he found a Chinese investor willing to launch the project and it was about to take off the ground, alas, when the regime fell.
All about this sports school project came to light soon after the Maithri government took office. The former Ministerial Chief noted for his generosity towards those near and dear to him had even appointed a local agent for the project.
The new authorities were wondering whether to go ahead with this ambitious project, when a member of a political family with siblings well known for their prowess in a popular game visited China.
Lo and behold! The sibling had returned home as the new local agent of the stalled Chinese-funded sports training school project.? Hurried plans are now underway to get it off the ground.

In the wake of the ho ha over the issue, a three-member committee was appointed to probe the matter, but the employees of the main Bank quite openly mention the names of the bigwigs behind the shady transaction, they say.
These employees say that a certain heavyweight who would not normally directly involve himself in the auction, presided over it raising the eye brows of all and sundry. And he was the kingpin behind the operation that gave a windfall profit to the son in law?s company.
When the deal unexpectedly blew up in the face, the kingpin had advised the son-in-law to transfer the ownership of the company to his father.
The bank employees who were happy to see the back of the former Chief only a few weeks ago, now regretfully say that the remedy is worse than the disease.
