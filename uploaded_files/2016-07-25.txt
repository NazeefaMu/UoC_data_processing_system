American jailed for killing Sri Lankan wife in Saudi
	
A US resident, convicted of killing his Sri Lankan wife, has been sentenced to five years in jail by a Saudi court, the Arab News reported on Monday.
The accused is said to have hidden the wife?s body for eight months in a tube inside a pipe designed to detect gas in Al-Kharj desert.
Laborers at one of the major oil companies found the decomposed body inside the pipe located in their work area. That area is supervised by a US agent, married to a Sri Lankan woman, who had disappeared.
The workers immediately reported the matter to the supervisor who was supposed to report it to the company?s officials. But he was late in reporting the body for two hours, something that prompted the police to investigate the matter. The body turned out to be his wife?s.
One of the workers said the supervisor asked him to burn or bury the body, but he refused and asked him to inform the police.
Another laborer told investigators that he had been asked to weld the pipe and then throw it in a well.
The convict acknowledged that the body was his wife?s, but denied accusations in the workers? testimonies.
The sons of the woman from a previous marriage rejected the verdict, demanding execution of the murderer.
They said, based on the witnesses? testimony and the evidence, it looks like a deliberate murder.

ComBank ranked  among World?s Top  1000 Banks again
	
Commercial Bank of Ceylon PLC has become the only Sri Lankan bank to be ranked among the Top 1000 Banks of the World for the sixth year running, setting yet another benchmark for consistency.
This prestigious ranking is published annually by ?The Banker? magazine of the UK, and the 2016 list is based on the bank?s key performance indicators for FY 2015.?
The Top 1000 Banks of the World are ranked on the basis of Tier I capital, assets, capital assets ratio, pre-tax profits, return on capital, return on assets, BIS (Basel) Capital ratio, NPL to total loans, loans to assets ratio, risk weighted assets (RWA) to total assets (TA) ratio and cost income ratio.
?In banking, size does matter, but the stringent evaluation for this ranking looks at many other mission-critical key performance indicators as well,? Commercial Bank Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer Jegan Durairatnam said.
?In that context, just being among the Top 1000 is a significant achievement for a Sri Lankan bank, and staying there for six years consecutively is a great demonstration of consistency for which the entire team of Commercial Bank must be given credit.?
He also added that the bank wishes to thank all its stakeholders for their support in achieving this feat. Commercial Bank ended FY 2015, the period assessed for the 2016 ranking, with assets of Rs.880 billion, profit before tax of Rs.17.1 billion, a loan book of Rs.508.1 billion, deposits of Rs.624.1 billion, and Tier I Capital Adequacy Ratio of 11.6 percent.
The Top 1000 World Banks ranking is compiled from a database of over 5,000 of the world?s biggest banks and is acknowledged by the global financial community as the definitive guide to bank rankings and analysis. Begun in 1970, the ranking is widely used all year round by senior bankers, corporate treasurers, corporate financiers, the professional services community and many others in their day-to-day decisions relating to banking.
Commenting on its latest ranking, The Banker magazine said: ?The 2016 Top 1000 results are indicative of the challenging environment banks found themselves operating in during 2015. Even the Chinese banking industry?s meteoric growth shows signs of slowing down for the first time in a decade. For the last few years, China?s banks have dominated the ranking based on Tier 1 capital. This year Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) remains number 1 and China Construction Bank number 2, with 4 out of the top 5 places held by Chinese banks.?
The Banker is published by Financial Times Business, which is the specialist publishing and conferences arm of the FT Group.

## Title: Consensual govt. will run its full term: President

Consensual govt. will run its full term: President
	
President Maithripala Sirisena today said whatever setbacks, whatever road blocks were thrown in its way, the consensual government would run its full term of five years to fulfil its pledges given in August 2015.
Addressing a massive public rally after placing the treasures and relics in the main dam of the ?Kaluganga Reservoir? President Sirisena went on to say that the challenges would not deter the UNP ? SLFP led consensual government from its commitment to make Sri Lanka a fully developed, technology savvy country by 2020.
"It is only one and a half years to the consensual government and 19 months to my presidency. Our detractors are keen to topple the government and desperately trying to grab power. I must tell them that this government will run its full term and fulfil its development programme. We will also complete our mission to restore Sri Lanka?s former glory in the global arena,? President Sirisena stressed.
He said the Moragahakanda Multipurpose Development Project and taking Mahaweli water to Rajarata were in the political domain since the time of the State Council and Communist leader Dr. S.A.Wickramasinghe raised the necessity of the launching of the project in many occasions in the State Council and later in Parliament. But due to the lack of investment, the proposals were in the backburner for several decades.
?As a school boy who ploughed the paddy field with my father in Polonnaruwa, I have witnessed how farmers in Rajarata suffered due to insufficient water for their day to day lives and for cultivation. There were numerous clashes and even murders committed by farmers on fellow farmers and government officials as the distribution of water was a tricky issue. That is why I started my struggle to launch the Moragahakanda Multipurpose Development Project when I was appointed as the deputy minister of Irrigation in 1994? President Sirisena stressed.
He said he visited the entire Rajarata forest range with respected Engineer Dr. A.N.S.Kulasinghe and the eminent professor showed him in detail the locations where water would be collected, released and bunds and reservoirs were to be constructed when the Moragahakanda project was launched.
Despite pledges by two Presidential winners in Chandrika Kumaratunga and Mahinda Rajapaksa in 1994 and 2005 respectively to launch the Moragahakanda development project it was continued to be a broken promise.
?Ultimately on my relentless pestering, President Rajapaksa consented to launch the Moragahakanda Multipurpose Development Project in 2007 without funds when I told him I would find money for the purpose. The stone laying ceremony was held on January 25, 2007 with much pomp and pageantry and I got much publicity. On January 28 I was removed from my portfolio of Mahaweli Development despite my vehement protests and anger and the much vital development project became once again only a day dream. Minister Bail Rajapaksa was adamant that I should not be given the Mahaweli Development portfolio even after President Rajapaksa showed some leniency on my protest. That is why I retained the Ministry of Mahaweli Development in addition to the Ministry of Defence as the Executive President,? President Sirisena added.
He said the Moragahakanda project was the dream of all Rajaparata people as it will resolve all the economic, social and health issues of the people in the North-Central East and North province. It will give the opportunity not cultivate three seasons and provide clean drinking water to one million families and water round the year to one million hectares.
The Moragahakanda reservoir and the entire development project will be the largest in the country and the last under the Mahaweli programme. The reservoir is six times of the water capacity of Parakrama Samudraya.
The Moragahakanda is the dream of the people in Rajarata that kept on bringing a smile to their faces instead of tear and sorrow. In two years we will realize this dream and out motherland is deemed to bless with many a benefit once this project is completed in the spheres of farmers? income, heath, agriculture, food production and social development, he stressed.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe says late President J.R,Jayewardene wanted to complete the Mahaweli development project in 10 years as opposed to protected 30 years and the task was given to late Gamini Dissanayaka.
?However, there were few other projects left behind and Moragahakanda was lone of them. No government was able to start a development programme as there was the 30 year war and now this government has got an opportunity to attend to them and expedite the development in the country.
The consensual government?s development programme covers the entire 9 provinces and a number of highly ambitious projects have been lined up to develop the country in tourism, agriculture, IT, food production and exports, Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said.
He added that it will be treachery and anti-national act if anyone attempts to sabotage this development drive because they have been launched not to fill the pockets of himself or of President Sirisena but pockets of the average citizen.
The welcome address was delivered by Deputy Mahaweli Development Minister Anuradha Jayaratne. (Sandun A Jayasekera reporting from Moragahakanda)

Don?t play with fire: Gammanpila tells PM
	
While criticizing the controversial statement made by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe in Kandy on Saturday, regarding certain media personnel, Opposition MP Udaya Gammanpila today said the Prime Minister should not play with fire.
Speaking at a media briefing, MP Gammanpila said Premier Wickremesinghe would soon learn a lesson from media personnel if he goes ahead with his decision to teach a lesson for certain print media institutions.
?I would like to remind him that the politicians who attempted to teach lessons for journalists had to end up with learning very good lessons for life. So, we are warning the Prime Minister, do not ask for troubles by playing with fire,? he said.
He went on to say that the role of media which is reporting occurrences and events of the country should not be prevented by any means.
Adding to that, he said if the country is already facing a chaotic situation, reporting of day-to-day happenings of the country undoubtedly raises the opposition of the people.
Therefore, the government?s attempt to criticize or remove journalists who report the incidents, which impact the government, is futile.
Instead of that, it is better for the government to detect their weaknesses and take measures to correct them, he said.
?Media do not produce news. What they do is reporting. It is a responsibility of the government to work in a way the people are satisfied and as a result of that the media will have good things to report. The fault is with the government, not with media or the people,? MP Gammanpila said. (Piyumi Fonseka)

If SL loses, they will say it is because of me: Murali
	
Sri Lanka?s record-breaking spinner Muttiah Muralitharan launched a blistering attack Monday on his former bosses after they complained about his behaviour in his new role as a mentor to Australia.
After his former employers said Muralitharan was damaging his legacy, the 44-year-old accused Sri Lanka?s board of setting him up as a fall guy if the hosts lose a series to the visiting Australians.
And Muralitharan, the highest wicket-taker in Test history, then accused the board president of knowing nothing about cricket and angrily denounced any suggestion of being ?a traitor?. ?
?If Sri Lanka loses, they (the board) will say it is because of Murali,? he said in a recorded statement which was sent to AFP. ?
?They have no right to accuse me of being a traitor. Have they done one hundredth of what I have contributed to cricket in Sri Lanka?? This is a political game to cover their shortcomings,? he added. ?I am being used as a pawn to cover their failings.?
His outburst was sparked by a complaint by the board that he had bullied groundsmen into letting the Australians practise on the pitch which hosts the opening match in a three-Test series from Tuesday. ?
Cricket Australia confirmed they received a complaint about the incident at Pallekele Stadium, on the outskirts of Kandy, but said the issue had been resolved ?after discussions between the two management teams?. ?
Muralitharan is a hero in Sri Lanka after taking 800 Test wickets before retiring six years ago. ?
But his decision to impart his local knowledge to the tourists has raised eyebrows, not least because he was once labelled a ?chucker? by Australia?s then-prime minister John Howard.
Sri Lankan skipper Angelo Mathews was more conciliatory, acknowledging his former teammate?s expertise. ?
?The Australians obviously saw value in his knowledge of Sri Lankan conditions,? Mathews told reporters. ?
In his video statement, Muralitharan said he had not received any approach from the Sri Lankan board to help the island?s next generation of spinners and accused it of favouring foreign coaches over locals. ?
?They don?t give an opportunity to talented Sri Lankan coaches and prefer to bring white people from abroad,? he said. ?
?That affects our economy too because we have to pay them dollars that leave the country. That is treachery.?
Sri Lanka has a history of employing foreign coaches and re-hired South Africa?s Graham Ford earlier this year for a second stint.

The national ceremony to enshrine treasures and relics on the main dam of the 'Kalu Ganga Reservoir? of the ?Moragahakanda ? Kalu Ganga Multipurpose Development Project? (MKMDP) was held a short while ago with the participation of President Maithripala Sirisena.

Verizon buys Yahoo for $4.8 billion
	
Verizon Communications is speculated to announce it is buying Yahoo for $4.8 billion before
the start of trading in the USA today (July 25). It is said that the deal is consists of an
excessive price to pay for a company that?s core internet business is considered ?worthless?
by Wall Street.
Under the deal Verizon will get Yahoo?s online assets including search, mail and instant?messaging, along with its ad technology. Various real estate holdings will also be included.?Verizon is building a portfolio of online content and aiming to monetize it via advertising. In?the online advertising business Verizon faces two dominant competitors: Google and?Facebook.
Acquiring Yahoo will bring in hundreds of millions more viewers from sites like News, Sports,
and Finance to complement Verizon?s popular properties like TechCrunch and Huffington
Post, which is acquired in last year?s AOL deal and its own mobile video app, called go90. In
the US, comScore puts Yahoo at No. 3 among digital properties.
Even with AOL and Yahoo assets, Verizon has a long way to go to catch up with the online
advertising leaders such as Google and Facebook. Verizon with AOL currently holds a mere
1.8% of the $69 billion digital ad market in the US. Yahoo has about 3.4%. Google and?Facebook together claim about half of it.
Over the last few years Yahoo has struggled to keep up with the changing internet?advertising landscape, with some analysts arguing that it has failed to remain relevant in?many of its core business.
Remaining relevant is the only way to survival in this technologically advanced &
informationally wealth era.

Video: Murali may suffer for his Aussie alliance: SLC
	
Former cricketer Muttiah Muralitharan?s teaming up with the Australian camp during the Warne-Murali trophy would be disadvantageous to Murali himself in the long run, Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) President Thilanga Sumathipala said yesterday.
?The decision to coach Australia will only be disadvantageous to Murali in the long run and not to Sri Lanka Cricket,? he said.
Responding to a question asked by a journalist in Kandy, he said the SLC had tried hard to protect Muralitharan from sticky situations and that it was hurt by his decision to team up with Australia in the match against Sri Lanka played in his hometown in Kandy.
?There is no barrier in improving his career by a decision like this. But we think it?s not ethical. After all, the series is named the Warne-Murali trophy. However, we are confident of winning the series even if it means having to face 10 Murali-type spinners. Murali is now only a former player,? he said.
Meanwhile, Mr. Sumathipala said they had informed Australia Cricket about an incident where Murali is alleged to have used a local stadium to train Australian cricketers without permission.???
