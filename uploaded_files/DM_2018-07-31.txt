Abduction of 11 youths: Some Defense counsel requested to favour  Navy individuals: CID
	
During the magisterial inquiry relating to the alleged abduction of 11 youths in 2008, Director of the CID Shani Abeysekara today revealed that, several years ago, some of the defence lawyers, who currently represent the suspects, have requested him to favour several Navy individuals, who were at that time not named as suspects into the inquiry.
At the onset of the inquiry, Presidents Counsel Shavendra Fernando and Counsel Asith Siriwardena raised a question over the inclusion of some details relating to them made by the prosecution on February 8, 2018 in the B report.
In February, the prosecution in a further report had included about some alleged involvement of the two defence counsel in the investigations. These details only appeared in the B report as they were not expressed to the Magistrate in open court.
Rejecting those allegations, the Defence counsel were of the view that it was totally false as the Prosecution had attempted to tarnish their reputation using the B report maliciously.
While the Prosecution and the Defense were contesting on this inclusion made by the prosecution into the B report, Director of the CID said what actually was included. He said Counsel Asith Siriwardena, who currently appeared for the second suspect of the inquiry (Sumith Ranasinghe) had visited the CID Director some time back (in 2013) and insisted not to name his client as a suspect into the inquiry.
Additionally, Mr. Shani Abeysekara also revealed that some suspects including D.K.P. Dasanayake had also met two Attorney Generals Department officers with the assistance of Counsel Asith Siriwardena prior to those individuals are named as suspects into the inquiry.
However, Counsel Asith Siriwardena denied all the allegations and maintained that he had not solicited such request from the Director of the CID. And also challenge the CID Director to prove such an alleged involvement of his in assisting those individuals to meet people in the AG Department.
He was of the view that he visited the Director with the second suspect, who was not a suspect then, in the capacity as a lawyer to convey whatever things his client wanted to share with the Director.
The Defence counsel also drew the Court attention on the fact that why these facts suddenly came into light as they happened sometime back.
It was said that both Defence counsel had earlier served for the Attorney Generals Department and now at the private bar.
Explaining about the other inclusion into the B report on Shavendra Fernando PC, CID Director said that he had instructed him and the OIC of the CID who conducted the abduction inquiry to avoid getting down certain people into the investigation when Mr. Fernando was serving as a Deputy Solicitor General of the Attorney Generals Department.
According to the Director, this has happened during the time period where three Habeas corpus cases were being inquired at the Chief Magistrates Court, where Mr. Fernando appeared for the respondents.
Rejecting all the allegations, Shavendra Fernando PC said that he had served for the Attorney Generals Department over thirty years and also served as legal director at the Navy. He said that it was a representation on behalf of the Attorney General in those Habeas corpus cases as the AG was too cited as a respondent in the habeas corpus cases by the petitioners.
After listening to some lengthy submissions of the counsel, the Fort Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne directed the CID to prevent including irrelevant facts in the B report if those facts are outside of the inquiry.
Meanwhile, considering the delay that took prosecution to conclude the investigation, Counsel Achala Seneviratne, who appeared for the aggrieved parties asked the Court and the Prosecution as to why some individuals mentioned continuously in several B reports are not named as suspects into the inquiry.
She was of the view that there was sufficient evidence in some of the statements recorded by the prosecution to ascertain the some individuals have given instructions to the suspects.
When the Magistrate asked to be more certain on such alleged individuals, Counsel Seneviratne said Former Navy Commander Wasantha Karannagoda was one of them and why he was not named yet as a suspect is a serious question.
Replying to that comment, Senior State Counsel Janaka Bandara who appeared for the CID explained the importance of perusing all the materials carefully before taking actions against individuals, he was of the view that the prosecution would need to consider on the weight of the evidence that they have to proceed with the case.
When questioned by the Magistrate, SSC Janaka Bandara said that they will thoroughly look into the materials collected in the whole inquiry within three months and report to court on the process of further legal actions of indictments. (Shehan Chamika Silva)

Arrest warrant on Jaliya Wickremasuriya extended
	
The Colombo Fort Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne today extended the arrest warrant of former Sri Lankan Ambassador to USA, Jaliya Wickremasuriya, with regard to the magisterial inquiry conducted into the alleged misappropriation of USD 132,000 of State funds in the process of purchasing a building for the Sri Lankan embassy in Washington, USA.
Filing a further report, FCID obtained court orders from all Banks and finance institutions in the expectation of getting details relating to the money that the suspect is alleged to have misappropriated.
According to the Defense submission, it was revealed that former ambassadors immunity had been revoked by the State while he was being treated in USA and therefore the USA State Department does not allow him to leave the country as there was another investigation going on against him in USA.
However, the prosecution raised legal question over the two sureties (his wife and sister-in-law) and a land that were attached as bonds when the suspect was released on bail as two sureties has not so far turned up in court on behalf of the suspect.
The Magistrate fixed August 27 to deliver an order with regard to the sureties of the suspect.(Shehan Chamika Silva)

'False' advertisements by FM: JO files SC petition
	
The Joint Opposition today said it has filed a petition in the Supreme Court against the Finance Minister over allegedly misusing public funds to publish newspaper advertisements on fuel prices which contained false facts.
JO MP Bandula Gunawardana said the motive of these advertisements, which were focused on fuel prices and pricing formula, was to sling mud at former President Mahinda Rajapaksa through the State media.
We have nothing against a ministry publishing newspaper advertisements. However, misusing public funds to publish bogus information through the State media to sling mud at individuals cannot be condoned, he told a news briefing.
He said the advertisements by the Finance Ministry have said that the price of a crude oil barrel was 60 USD during the Rajapaksa regime and a litre of petrol was sold at a price of Rs.157.
These facts are false. The price of a crude oil barrel was 104 USD during the said time and a litre of petrol was sold for Rs.150, he said.
Meanwhile, he said they were also mulling legal action over a gazette issued by the Finance Ministry ordering the Customs Department to remove Customs duty of a number of imported items, without the approval of the Cabinet.
He said the gazette has been issued on July 19 in relation with the Free Trade Agreement (FTA) signed with Singapore.
This gazette instructs the Customs to remove taxes on a variety of products and items ranging from animal sperms to hair dryers. Minister Lakshman Kiriella recently asked what knowledge medical doctors have about the FTA. We would like to ask what knowledge Minister Kiriella has about this gazette, Mr. Gunawardana said.

Healing through Reparations:  Canadian Experience
	
A source of great shame for Canadians, residential schools were meant to make indigenous children more British. From 1883 until 1996, the children were taken from their homes and placed in church-run schools far from their communities. The goal of the government-led residential school policy was to destroy the indigenous culture and language. During this time, it is estimated that 150,000 children were placed in residential schools and 6,000 of those children were killed. At the schools, indigenous children faced physical, sexual, emotional, and psychological abuse from the staff.
The Indian Residential Schools Settlement Agreement (IRSSA) between residential school survivors, Ottawa, and the Crown was announced in 2006. IRSSA recognises the need for reconciliation and is made up of five components: the Common Experience Payment (CEP); Independent Assessment Process (IAP); the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC); Commemoration; and Health and Healing Services. IRSSA allocated $1.9 billion USD for CEP to be distributed out to former residents of the schools. Additional funds have been set aside for the IAP, which deals with sexual, physical and psychological abuse claims, as well as for collective reparations, such as commemorative projects and health services.
Supporting the need for a reparations process, the TRC visited hundreds of indigenous communities across Canada from 2008 to 2015 to document the experiences of residential school attendees. They declared that the residential school policy was in fact cultural genocide and the schools had been filled with unimaginable horrors.
It was discovered that the government had been able to fill the schools by threatening the parents with jail time. This left the families with very little choice in the matter. Either the children are left alone while their parents go to jail or they go to the residential schools. In some testimonies, such as Isaac Daniels statement to the TRC, children decided so their parents would not have to.
I heard my dad talking to my mom there, and he was kind of crying, but he was talking in Cree now. He said that, Its either residential school for my boys, or I go to jail. He said that in Cree. So, I overheard him. So I said the next morning, we all got up, and I said, Well, Im going to residential school, cause I didnt want my dad to go to jail.
 TRC, AVS, Isaac Daniels, statement to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada, Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, 22 June 2012, Statement Number: 2011-1779.
The abuse suffered in the residential schools highlighted the need for reparations. Throughout the Truth Commission, survivors spoke of the terror they faced in the schools from staff and their peers.
Every day was, you were in constant fear that, your hope was that it wasnt you today that were going to, that was going to be the target, the victim
 TRC, AVS, Timothy Henderson, Statement to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada, Winnipeg, Manitoba, 28 June 2011, Statement Number: 2011-0291.
Today, the after-effects of the residential schools are apparent. The trauma experienced by older generations and passed down to their children has left a large age gap in life expectancy between indigenous and non-indigenous people, high poverty rates, high suicide rates, and a high percentage of indigenous children in foster care.
Through their work, the TRC made a list of recommendations for the Canadian government called the 94 Calls to Action. The 94 Calls to Action relate to child welfare, education, language and culture, health, and justice. As of March, 2018, the Canadian government and communities have proposed projects for 31 of the Calls to Action, are implementing 18 of them, and have yet to start 35 of the recommendations. So far, Canada has completed 10 of the 94 Calls to Action, such as Calls for more inclusive media and education about the past and why apologies are necessary.

The IRSSA-started reparations process for residential school survivors is widely seen as an ongoing success story, however, Canada has only just begun righting the wrongs of its past against indigenous communities

The IRSSA-started reparations process for residential school survivors is widely seen as an ongoing success story, however, Canada has only just begun righting the wrongs of its past against indigenous communities. Canadians and the international community are calling for more reparations for groups harmed by discriminatory policies throughout Canadas history. Most recently, for the indigenous children who survived the Sixties Scoop adoption programme, which forced thousands of children into child welfare services and global adoption from the 1960s to the 1980s. On 6 October, 2017, the Canadian government agreed to pay out $640 million CAD in legal settlements for those affected by theadoption programme.
Canada is still facing its own challenges in the impartiality of the TRC, providing reparations that are acceptable to all victims, and implementing all of the Calls to Action. Despite this, the reparations process emphasises the needs of victims when deciding what remedies are appropriate. In Sri Lanka, there will be similar challenges in providing reparations appropriate to all victims who were harmed, purposefully or not. However, there is an opportunity for inclusiveness, victim-centrality and healing by addressing all experiences of civil unrest and conflict.

Moratuwa Uni undergrads  invent Thermal Ablation device
	
A team comprising final year students of the Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Moratuwa has developed an Endometrial Ablation device which possesses the proper live visual inspection capability. 
In some instances heavy abnormal bleeding, which takes place during the menstruation cycle of women, will subject to hysterectomy due to failed medical treatment. Hence many Gynecologists decide to remove the uterus. Before this device was invented there was a practice of removing the uterine wall using a heated balloon and this processposed a significant health risk. 
The three final year students, K.P.N. Gunarathne, M.R. Brian and R.L.A. Harshana of Department of Mechanical Engineering have carried out the research. They have been able to design and develop the machine under the guidance and supervision of Dr. Ranjith Amarasinghe, Director at the Centre for Advanced Mechatronics Systems and Coordinator for Mechatronic Systems Engineering Stream and Senior Lecturer of Department of Mechanical Engineering at the University of Moratuwa, Dr. Madhura Jayawardana a Consultant Obstetrician and Gynecologist and Senior Lecturer of Faculty of Medical Science, University of Sri Jayewardenepura and Dr. Nirosh Jayaweera, Senior Lecturer of Department of Mechanical Engineering at the University of Moratuwa. 

The removal of the uterine wall using a heated balloon had been done without the proper inspection of the inner uterus. This method poses a significant risk
	The machine has been successfully tested using a uterus of a pig and we expect to test the machine using a removed human uterus in the future
The ablation device will be inserted through the cervix of the uterus and the correct placement of the device will be verified through the live video feedback which is given through the endoscopic camera. Here the live visuals are transmitted using WIFI connectivity and it can be monitored either using a consultants smartphone or pre-set display unit. After the proper placement of the device inside the uterus, the thermal balloon will be inflated using a liquid solution until it covers a major area of inner layer of the uterus. Then the set values for the ablation process will be selected under the recommendation of a doctor. When the ablation process commences, the preset ablation temperature will be automatically maintained within the uterus for a preset time period. (Ex. 80 degree Celsius) 
Dr. Madhura Jayawardana stated, The removal of the uterine wall using a heated balloon had been done without the proper inspection of the inner uterus. This method poses a significant risk and there were possibilities that the machine reached the intestine after measuring the length between the cervix and the uterus, Dr. Jayawardana said.

Using a camera for feedback
The speciality of the machine invented by the undergrads is that a camera is used to investigate the inner uterus. The camera has the ability to transfer the photos, provide live videos and information on heating and the pressure inside the uterus to a computer or a mobile phone using wireless Wi-Fi technology. Further, it has the capability to automatically control the temperature within the thermal balloon of the ablation system in accordance with the set value. 
The machine is being used for clinical investigations at the first stage and will be used for the surgical purpose during the second stage. The removal of the uterus wall is defined as Thermal Ablation. Presently, there are no machines that can transmit the photos and live videos without a cable. As a solution to this issue, the undergraduates of University of Moratuwa were able to invent this machine at a low cost. 

Though Sri Lanka hasnt focused on encouraging novel ideas and concepts, a country like Japan gives priority to such innovations
	A student from this team has already been selected as a researcher from the Mechatronics Research Unit of University of Miyazaki, Japan and he is able to carry out further research on this area
Lower cost
The existing machine, currently used in hospitals during surgeries, costs LKR 35,000 to 60,000. We strongly believe that we will be able to perform the surgery at a much lower cost in the future. This surgery will not be performed on younger women and is generally performed on women who already have children or on women who are in their middle ages and have no intention of having more children. The machine has been successfully tested using a uterus of a pig and we expect to test the machine using a removed human uterus in the future, said Dr. Jayawardana.
Dr. Ranjith Amarasinghe stated, Though Sri Lanka hasnt focused on encouraging novel ideas and concepts, a country like Japan gives priority to such innovations.
A student from this team has already been selected as a researcher from the Mechatronics Research Unit of University of Miyazaki, Japan and he is able to carry out further research on this area from September onwards in Japan.
He said ,I also would like to express our gratitude to Prof. Kapila Perera, Vice Chancellor, University of Moratuwa, Prof. Nalin Wickramarachchi, Dean, Faculty of Engineering, Prof. Ruwan Gopura, Head, Department of Mechanical Engineering and all others who were involved with this project for their support given to work towards our research goals. 

The ablation device will be inserted through the cervix of the uterus and the correct placement of the device will be verified through the live video feedback which is given through the endoscopic camera

Political agendas behind trade union actions: UNP
	
Trade union action carried out by the sectors including the Government Medical Officers' Association (GMOA) and railway trade unions were politically motivated, Telecommunication, Digital Infrastructure and Foreign Employment Minister Harin Fernando said.
Addressing a news briefing, he said the general public were highly inconvenienced because of the trade union actions which were not carried out with a genuine intention but to fulfill political aspirations.
The GMOA recently decided to resort to trade union actions over the Sri Lanka - Singapore Free Trade Agreement which has nothing to do with doctors. This is utterly irrelevant to their subject. However, at the end of the day, it is the people who have to suffer from these strike actions, he said.
He said the image of the medical service gets tarnished because of some doctors who are acting according to the whims and fancies of politicians.
The recent strike actions carried out by the GMOA and railway unions could have been resolved if they properly dealt with the Government without inconveniencing the general public, the Minister said.
Meanwhile, he said the incumbent Government had done a tremendous service towards the upliftment of the Health sector, irrespective of the accusations of some doctors. (Sheain Fernandopulle)

Realistic Imran openly acknowledges military role in Pakistans governance
	
Waiting for more than two decades in the Opposition to grab power from established political parties like the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) and the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP), Pakistans Prime Minister- to-be Imran Khan has had the time to deeply analyse Pakistani politics and arrive at some home truths.
One of the truths he has learned is that the supremacy and pre-eminence of the armed forces, particularly the army, cannot be, and should not
be, challenged.
Challenging the military will be both futile and dangerous. All said and done, with all the institutional trappings of a modern democracy, Pakistan continues to be under the tutelage of the armed forces, or to be precise, the army, the largest and the most important of the three services.
The army is the final arbiter of the destiny of Pakistan. This is so for historical reasons but also because,these days, practically every national question is subsumed under the rubric of national security. Even established democratic states are becoming de facto national security states.
Speaking about the place of the army in the Pakistani national scheme, Imran told an interviewer: I think a democratic government rules from moral authority. And if you dont have moral authority, then those who have the physical authority assert themselves.
In my opinion, the army is a Pakistani Army and not an enemy army. I will carry the army with me.
Unlike Nawaz Sharif, who had fallen out with the army over the issue of peace with India and lost power twice because of that, Imran has consistently praised the army and acknowledged its stabilizing role in Pakistani politics and governance.

Pakistan has a long history of seeking the help of the army to restore governance made dysfunctional by squabbling politicians. It was political confusion and frequent changes in government which brought the army into the game for the first time in 1958
He blames corrupt and irresponsible civilian leaders and neighbouring India and Afghanistan for the entry of the army into Pakistani politics and governance.
The hostility of India and Afghanistan toward Pakistan forces the military to play an outsize role in the country. I have very clear foreign policy objectives, and where there are security concerns of the army, we will address them. It is our army, Imran said.
On another occasion, Imran declared that nothing can be done in Pakistan by maligning the army and rhetorically declared: Now is the time to decide whether we want to be used by the enemy and turn against the Pakistan army. The country will not survive if the army does not.
Imran was close to the extremist former Inter-Services Intelligence Chief Gen. Hamid Gul who he had hailed as a Mujahid (one who strives for the cause of God).
Nawaz Sharif had dubbed Imran as the ladla or the pet of the army for all his utterances. Sharifs daughter Maryam Nawaz had dubbed him a stooge. But Imran retorted saying that Sharif was brought up on the lap of Gen. Zia-ul-Haq, the military dictator of the 1980s who Islamized Pakistan. Subsequently, Sharif had used army financial backing to rig elections in 1990. In 2012 the Supreme Court had officially ruled that two Army Generals, Mirza Aslam Baig, and Asad Durrani (Head of ISI) along with President Ghulam Ishaq Khan, had provided financial assistance to Sharifs election campaign in 1990.
In 1993 the then army Chief Gen. Abdul Waheed Kakar had persuaded both President Ghulam Ishaq Khan and Prime Minister Sharif to step down. During his second term, which began in 1997, Sharif appointed Gen. Pervez Musharraf as Army Chief in 1998. But Musharraf sacked Sharif in 1999 because of his soft policy towards India. 
According to the Pakistani military historian Dr. Ayesha Siddiqa, in 2007, when President Gen. Musharraf was committing excesses against the Supreme Court Chief Justice Iftikhar Choudhry, the then Army chief, Gen. Ashfaq Kayani put Musharraf under a brief but forced detention to make him relent.
Prior to that Mushrraf had to back out of his bid to strike a deal on Kashmir with India because the armys three star Generals felt that hostility to India is the armys raison detre and, therefore, confrontation should be maintained.
Pakistan has a long history of seeking the help of the army to restore governance made dysfunctional by squabbling politicians. It was political confusion and frequent changes in government which brought the army into the game for the first time in 1958. 
Since then there have been three successful military coups and four periods of military rule. Pakistan was under direct military rule for 17 years (between 1956-62/1969-71/1977 to 1988/1999 to 2002). It was under an elected civilian government but functioning under a military President for 15 years (from 1962 to 1969/1985-1988/2002-2007). Between 1988 and 1999, civilian governments were under the close watch of the army. Pakistan had untrammelled civilian rule only between 1971 and 1977 under Z.A. Bhutto.
Since the earliest days, Pakistani politicians had made it a habit to hobnob with the military and use it to achieve their narrow political ends. The military naturally took advantage of this and dictated terms, which the politicians generally accepted. In case they didnt or they failed to live up to the armys expectations or fell out of line, they would get thrown out, either through a coup or through electoral rigging.
Military in Pakistani Economy
According to Dr. Ayesha Siddiqa, authoress of Military Inc. Inside Pakistans Military Economy (Penguin-Random House 2007 and 2017) the militarys nett worth is more than British Pounds 10 billion (US$ 13.1 billion). She found that in 2007, the army owned 12% per cent of the countrys land, its holdings being mostly fertile soil in the eastern Punjab. Two thirds of that land were in the hands of senior current and former military officials, mostly Brigadiers, Majors-General and Generals. The most senior 100 military officials were estimated to be worth GBP 3.5 billion (US$ 4.5 billion).
Many of the countrys largest corporations are controlled by the military, thanks largely to an opaque network of powerful Foundations originally set up to look after the pension needs of army personnel, Siddiqa says. The largest three  the Fauji, Shaheen and Bahria Foundations, controlled by the army, air force and navy respectively, run more than 100 commercial entities involved in everything from cement to cereal production. Only nine had ever published partial financial accounts. 
The Fauji foundation, the largest, is estimated by Siddiqa to be worth several billion pounds. The Army Welfare Trust runs one of the countrys largest banks, Askari Commercial Bank, along with an airline, a travel agency and even a stud farm. Then there is the National Logistic Cell, Pakistans largest shipper and freight transporter and the countrys largest corporation, which builds roads and bridges and stores grain. 
President Gen. Pervez Musharraf banned the 2007 edition of Siddiqas book. In his blog he published an article refuting her data. Firstly the military running businesses is not peculiar to Pakistan, the article pointed out. 

The army is the final arbiter of the destiny of Pakistan. This is so for historical reasons but also because,these days, practically every national question is subsumed under the rubric of national security
The US and UK have Private Military Enterprises (PME). Prominent US PMEs are: Halliburton, Black Water World Wide, Defence security, Titan Corporation, Kellogg Brown and Roots, Air Scan, Dyn Corps and CACI International. The UK has Black Ops, and Aegis Defence Services, which were beneficiaries of the Iraq war. Worldwide PMEs are worth US$ 100 billion.
Musharrafs blog also pointed out that Pakistans military businesses (MILBUS ) were only a fraction of the enterprises in the country. Out of the 24 cement factories in Pakistan only one was owned by the Fauji Foundation; only one of 10 fertilizer plants belongs to the military; and only 10 of the 924 hospitals were run by a military foundation.
In 2007, the total value of MILBUs in Pakistan was only US$ 1.1 billion, which was only 0.8% of the country US$ 160 billion free market economy, Musharrafs blog said.

He said the present number of traffic offences had been increased with spot fines.

The minimum fine prior to the reversion of traffic fines was Rs.100 while the maximum was Rs.2500. 
According to revision of traffic fines, the minimum fine amounts to Rs.500 and the maximum is Rs. 3000. 
Not contraryto the law
This isnt a decision that was taken all of a sudden. We had several discussions with relevant authorities and came to a conclusion that the fines had to be increased in order to minimise the occurrences of severe accidents, SP Hapugoda said. 
We have observed that drivers dont pay much attention to traffic signs and regulations and consequently, have to undergo severe consequences, even death,SP Hapugoda added. 
He said that they hadnt amended the new fines in contrary to the Motor Traffic Act or any law. 
About 100,000 Police fine books had already been sent for printing. 10,000 books have been delivered to 489 Police Stations in 42 Police Divisions, he added. 
Traffic fines for additional offences had been amended to Rs.1,000 as a minimum fine and a maximum of Rs.3,000. The fine for breaking speed limits has been increased to Rs.3,000 from Rs.1,000. The fine for high speed will have to be paid within 14 days. And after 14 days the offender will have to pay double, SP Hapugoda said. 
He said fines going up to Rs.25,000 for seven traffic offences, such as drunk driving, would be added as spot fines after receiving Cabinet approval.

An attempt to boost Govt. revenue

Meanwhile, Lanka Private Bus Owners Association (LPBOA) President Gemunu Wijeratne told the that by increasing traffic fines regarding 33 offences, the Government was attempting to increase its revenue rather ensuring discipline and safety. 
By increasing traffic fines for 33 offences, the Government cannot reduce road accidents, but would be able to increase Government revenue, Wijeratne said. 
Before implementing new fines and regulations, the road infrastructure facilities such as road capacity and proper bus halts should be developed. 
The Government should pay attention to renovating roads and traffic signs which are in a dilapidated condition. Perhaps, drivers arent aware of some of the traffic offences until they are caught by cops for breaking those rules, he added 
Therefore, he said that there is lot to be done on the part of Government before thinking of increasing its revenue. 
However, he said that the association wouldnt increase bus fares in response to the increase in traffic fines.

Move to minimize road accidents hailed
Speaking to , National Council for Road Safety (NCRF) Chairman Dr. Sisira Kodagoda said the decision taken by the Government was a good one as far as traffic accidents in Sri Lanka are concerned. 
Its only by increasing traffic fines that people become more cautious of their behaviour on the roads. Otherwise, they dont care much about traffic rules, Dr. Kodagoda said. 
Some countries have been able to reduce the number of road accidents by increasing traffic fines. If Sri Lanka is to reduce road accidents, the traffic fines should be increased, Dr. Kodagoda added.

Moreover, he said the council would introduce a system within two months so that offenders can pay traffic fines via cards. 

Spot fines illegalas traffic boardsare illegal
Police traffic expert retired DIG T. Perinpanayagam told the that the majority of those regulations were in contravention of the Provisions of the enabling Laws. 
Some speed limit sign boards installed at different locations on main roads are contrary to the Government gazette Nos.763/36 and 1940/21, Perinpanayagam charged. 
Some installed No-parking sign boards, No-parking and standing sign boards arent keeping with the motor traffic regulations regarding traffic signs, road makings and signals published in the Government gazette No.1940/21 dated 12.11.2015, Perinpanayagam added. 
Panel arrows indicating the starting point, the ending point and the centre panel indicating both ends, are absent and not exhibited in these prevailing parking sign boards, he said. 

Its only by increasing traffic fines that people become more cautious of their behaviour on the roads. Otherwise, they dont care much about traffic rules
-Dr. Sisira KodagodaNCRFChairman


He asked as to how the Ministry of Transport had increased the spot fines for traffic offences when the majority of traffic signal boards were contrary to the law. 
The enforcement of the Law in such an errant manner is a negation of the fundamental rights to the equal protection of the Law guaranteed by Article 12 (1) of the Constitution and directive delivered in SC (FR) application No. 297/2007 dated 03. 12.2007, Perinpanayagam added. 
In conclusion, it should be noted that something might have gone wrong in this regard because this newspaper has heard both positive and negative comments regarding the increase in traffic fines. Hence, the authorities must heed to the feedback about what has gone wrong when implementing these laws.

## Title: Role of Science,  Scientific Literacy in  Democracy and Development

Role of Science,  Scientific Literacy in  Democracy and Development
	
When many developing countries had very low levels of literacy, international institutions like UNESCO articulated the need to improve literacy levels in these countries. In more recent years, most developing countries have achieved high rates of literacy. On the other hand , persisting challenges of social and economic development coupled with rapid scientific and technological advancements in the world, many countries have recognised the need for their general populations to go beyond simple reading and writing ability to embrace a range of other aptitudes in order to be able to function more effectively in a more challenging environment. These include scientific, environmental and computer literacy.
Scientific literacy denotes  peoples knowledge and understanding of scientific concepts and processes necessary for making rational decisions in their daily lives and participation in informed public discourses. In other words, a general familiarity with matters of modern science helps them understand the world around them in a more factual manner. As is well known, the growing environmental challenges demand the general population to be conversant with matters connected with the environment so that they can contribute to addressing emerging issues more effectively. So, is the case with the fast changing communication technologies. A familiarity with digital technology helps people to deal with challenges and opportunities they present. 

The lack of critical thinking and analytical skills is a major hindrance to innovation which is considered as a precondition for finding practical solutions to a myriad of problems that human societies face today
Risks and benefits of modern technology
Evidence of modern scientific advancement is ubiquitous in almost all parts of the world today. Use of technological gadgets is common even in less developed societies as is evident from the widespread use of mobile technologies. While the benefits are often obvious to many people, the fact that there are also risks associated with modern technology is not so obvious and known to many people. These include issues of cyber security, threats to personal well being and safety, increasing sense of social isolation, relational problems, addiction to and dependence on technology, etc. The risks involved can vary across countries depending on diverse factors. New research can shed more light on the above and other issues and educate the public accordingly. 
What is equally important to note is that, in many developing countries including Sri Lanka, the connection of most people to modern science is mostly through their passive relationship to useful products of scientific research such as mobile phones and household gadgets rather than due any internalization of values, methods and ethos of modern science. This is partly due to the kind of general education that they are exposed to and partly due to the dominance of non-scientific discourses in society in the mass media, religious institutions and even politics. In fact, early and sustained exposure to religious rituals undermines critical and analytical skills in children and youth. Surveys have shown consistently that, unlike youth in the developed world, the vast majority of youth in Sri Lanka have a strong religious rather than a scientific orientation, not to mentions the adult population. The lack of critical thinking and analytical skills is a major hindrance to innovation which is considered as a precondition for finding practical solutions to a myriad of problems that human societies face today. As is well known, our education system does not promote innovation but encourages rote learning and is based on memory testing examinations leading to paper qualifications. 
The lack of critical thinking and analytical skills among school leavers and others has wide ranging implications. Firstly, it prevents them from playing a constructive role in society as they by and large become blind followers of populist politicians, religious leaders and demagogues. Secondly, school leavers and even university graduates without such skills look for less demanding and less challenging jobs in the state sector, often making them dependent on political patronage or leave the country for unskilled jobs. And, finally, the lack of highly skilled work. The lack of educational reforms to improve the quality of education to make it more skill-oriented and the persisting neglect of research and development by successive governments over several decades have made the situation worse. Any perceptive observer of Sri Lankas development scene would realize that the country is trapped in a vicious cycle. For example, predominance of low value traditional exports, chronic dependence on high value technology intensive product imports, consequent widening trade gap, increasing export of labour, wage inflation, high cost of production and living, foreign borrowings, accumulating debts, low investment in education and research, low skilled labor force, and so on. Countrys development challenges are hardly discussed in terms of the above vicious cycle and almost all politicians talk about other things and carry on regardless. No leader seems to be prepared to challenge the hegemony of the religious establishment in public affairs and point out the need to restore modern science to its due place in education and public life.
While we continue to innovate in novel religious rituals and persist with archaic ideas due to poor education, we want to export unskilled labour to East Asian countries where the political leaders know that their countries can be competitive in the world not by resorting to and promoting religious rituals but by investing in modern education and research. As is well known, most of these countries have some of the highest rates of public investment in these areas in comparison to the rest of the world. Universities and research institutes in these countries not only train scientific personnel needed by industry but also come up with new products and processes for industrial and other sectors. By contrast, Sri Lankan institutions have lagged far behind and even the long standing research institutes in diverse areas have been neglected over the years. There are many factors that have contributed to this situation.

SL visa scam revealed, but no review of past applications
	
The New Zealand immigration office in Mumbai that handles Sri Lankan applications received a tip off at the start of the year.
Inquiries led officials to conclude a Sri Lankan based company was fraudulently creating documentation to help students meet the criteria of having money in the bank.
Official briefings to Immigration Minister Iain Lees-Galloway show investigations are under way into the potential involvement of education agents in Sri Lanka, the finance company, whose name is redacted in the papers, and students as a result of these revelations.
There were 88 pending applications when the fraud was discovered and after further checks were done 83 were declined. The tip-off was in January.
The National Party wants to know why hundreds of past visas that have been granted to Sri Lankan students won't be reviewed.
The papers said a number of New Zealand educational providers had been affected and they had been told about what had happened and warned about the impact of student numbers in the future.
There was also an allegation "students paid an additional fee to secure the documentation" which was under further investigation.
But the company will still be involved in the student visa application system, though under "intensive scrutiny and increased verification".
From 2015 to 2017 there were about 5000 student visa applications from Sri Lanka of which about 3800 were approved. The documents do not make it clear how long officials think the scam has been going on.
Former Immigration Minister and National Party spokesperson Michael Woodhouse asked Mr Lees-Galloway whether he would look at past years to make sure the visas approved were legitimate.
Mr Lees-Galloway said that after scrutinising, then rejecting, most of the 88 applications the focus would now be on any future signs of fraud.
"To identify applications with similar characteristics already decided by INZ [Immigration New Zealand] would require substantial collation which I do not believe is in the public interest."
According to Mr Woodhouse up to half of Sri Lankan applicants could have used the company "fraudulently", and said that should be enough for officials to find how widespread any fraud was.
They were arriving in New Zealand ripe for exploitation as they had no money to support themselves, he said.
"I'm concerned that they are perpetrators but also potential victims."
It was "extraordinary" that the minister admitted no work had been done to review past applications.
"Of course it's in the public interest to make sure our visa system has integrity." (radionz.co.nz)

Sri Lanka Team selected for HSBC International Junior Golf Championship 2018
	
Vinod Weerasinghe to Lead Sri Lanka Squad
Sri Lanka Golf (SLG), the national body for Golf in Sri Lanka together with HSBC will host for the second year running the international junior golf championship to be played among the countries in the region; Sri Lanka, Pakistan and India. Sri Lanka won the inaugural tournament played last year beating Pakistan in a cliff hanger.
This year Malaysia too have entered a two member team and it is hoped that they would send a full contingent next year to further increase the Asian participation.
This event which was created to offer a platform for our juniors to compete among the best in the Indian sub-continent and Asia, was the brainchild of the SLG Junior Sub Committee and was conceived with the singular aim of raising the standard of the sport in the country. The format structured on a hybrid version of similar international team events played worldwide such as Asia Pacific Golf Team Championship and the Ryder Cup in the USA.
Each of the countries will field a team comprising of 2 boys and 2 girls.
Sri Lanka team was selected by the national golf selectors headed by Captain Navin de Silva. Current Sri Lanka Junior boys champion Vinod Weerasinghe of British School has been picked to lead Sri Lanka, whilst the team also comprises18 year old Armand Flamer Caldera of St Thomas College, Mount Lavinia who is currently ranked No.2 nationally and who has also represented Sri Lanka at the Asian Championship in Sailing.
The two girls represented on the team are 16 year old Taniya Balasuriya of Sri Jayawardenapura Girls School, Kotte and 15 year old Kayla Perera of Ladies College. Both have considerable international exposure having participated in many overseas golf events.
Preceding the International team championship an individual event will be open to current junior golfers in the country on 1st of August, which is also to be played at the Royal Colombo Golf Club.
This will be based on four age groups and categorised as; 15-18+ years (Gold Division), 12-14+ years (Silver Division), 10 -11+ years (Bronze Division) and 9 years and under (Copper Division).
The HSBC Junior International Golf championship is supported by several prestigious event partners.
Cinnamon Life as the hospitality partner and they will host all the international teams whilst MAS Kreeda, the Apparel partner have generously provided sportswear for the grass root programme.
IMORICH from Elephant House has come forward as the indulgence partner.
In addition Olu water will support the event as the official beverage with Callaway Golf, the renowned Golf brand as the equipment sponsor.

## Title: Strikes, protests should not deprive common mans rights

Strikes, protests should not deprive common mans rights
	
Yesterdays Daily Mirror reported that the Joint Opposition is to postpone Janabalaya Colombata (Peoples power to Colombo), the continual mass protest they have organized in September so that it would not coincide with the GCE Advanced Level examination. The story says that the decision had been taken after former President Mahinda Rajapaksa had instructed them to do so. 
Given the frustration felt by the ordinary people who are suffering due to so many protests by trade unions of various sectors and especially by the university students launching on daily basis mainly on busy streets, one cannot but commend the former President for the decision. Opponents of the Joint Opposition might attribute the decision to something else, but what matters to the people is the postponement of the protest which is a great consolation to them. 
Rarely a day passes now without a strike or a protest march hindering the lives of hundreds of thousands of people especially the young school children. People get news alerts sent by various media institutions announcing and warning on the blockades of main roads by various trade unions or students almost every day. And the trade unions and the student unions do not seem to understand the frustration and anger among the victims of these so-called protests. 
It is a well known fact that the majority of these protests, whether they be strikes, picketing or street demonstrations are politically motivated and the reasons given for them are just smokescreens for the real reasons. For instance, the students protest against the South Asian Institute for Technology and Medicine (SAITM) involving hundreds of days for the last three years were backed by the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP), Frontline Socialist Party (FSP) and the Joint Opposition and the former two parties had directly been involved in organizing those protests. 
According to the Marxist theory followed by the JVP and the FSP the strikes and other protests are not meant for the resolving of the attributed problems, rather they are meant to build the party which would ultimately capture power to bring in socialism. And the Joint Opposition or any other party in the Opposition for that matter would support any protest or strike just to embarrass the government or to topple the government. Whatever the motive of the political parties that would hide behind these protests might be, it is the ordinary people who are at the receiving end.
The trade union actions today are not meant for expression of the workers protest or frustration over their grievances that should be addressed by the authorities, but they take to such actions to pressurize or embarrass the authorities by harassing the general public and even putting their lives in danger in order to get their problems addressed. Thus the more the people are harassed or made to suffer or their lives are put in danger the more are the trade union actions deemed to be successful. The success of a trade union action by the doctors are measured by the number of deaths occurred especially due to such actions. A students street demonstration would be deemed successful if it had created chaos through traffic snarls, stranding hundreds of thousands of people including hungry school children. Hence, these so-called struggles are not launched on holidays; they are being launched on week days. 
This is a clear manifestation of the heartlessness and the selfishness of the leaders of the trade unions and students unions as well as the political parties behind those protests. This is more so given the high number of protests and demonstrations launched within a week. 
Apart from the inconvenience caused to the ordinary people there is another important fact to be reckoned with, in respect of these strikes and protests. Last year, the Sunday Times quoting Central Bank reports had reported that the total number of man-days lost to labour strikes reached a 10-year high in 2016, and an overall 104,327 man-days were squandered in 41 strikes in that year, the worst tally since 2007. It is obvious that the man-hours lost by the other institutions and the ordinary people due to these protests are not counted here. 
One cannot deny the rights of workers of any institution, public or private, to demand better working conditions or rectify any injustice meted out to them. But they do not have the right to deprive the others of their rights.

## Title: The rise of Amarapura

The rise of Amarapura
	

This school of thought discounts the Buddhist revival of the 19th century on the basis that it did not do away with the separation between the clergy and the laity
	Secondly, the Amarapura Nikaya was the first sect to emerge from an entrepreneurial class
	Even with the setting up of the Amarapura Nikaya, its primary objective was to reform the order in line with the historical antecedents of Buddhism

Its a mistake to suggest that the British did away with feudal structures in the societies they colonised. Far from it. In societies advancing towards capitalism, as Marx correctly surmised, such archaic structures would give way to an industrial class, which is why and how the Tories yielded to the Whigs. Such a transformation didnt come about in the colonies. The reason is obvious. The British didnt want to be the catalyst for the sort of change that would empower a nationalist bourgeoisie in the countries they had conquered. The one link with the past that those countries had which would hold back such a transformation was those feudal structures. In India, Africa, and of course Sri Lanka, the conqueror resorted to them, and in resorting to them, he found the perfect way of keeping us locked in the past. Those who believe that feudalism is retrogressive would be surprised to learn that the British didnt really combat it. Instead, they encouraged it. That was their game, after all. Divide and rule. 
I was thus a little wrong to suggest in my article on the Amarapura Nikaya (Sketches from the South: A history of schisms) that caste militancy figured in the politics of this country even before the arrival of the British. Prior to the annexation of Kandy, caste structures derived from one source; the whims of the kings. But while its true that these structures existed and had a decisive influence on the lives of the subjects of those kings, its nevertheless a fallacy to suggest that feudalism in Sri Lanka was the foundation of a harmonious utopia (which is what historians opposed to colonialism, particularly the romantic historians, contend). A more balanced and moderate reading of the processes which engulfed this country after the Kandyan annexation, especially in relation to the shifts in the Buddhist order, is called for. Since I stopped or paused in my earlier article at the point of the founding of the Amarapura Nikaya, what is now needed is an exploration into how that Nikaya itself fell victim, at least for a brief period of time, to the same caste politics that had earlier invaded the Siyam Nikaya. 
New sect inaugurated
To recap; in 1799, a contingent of monks from the Salagama caste, financed by a leading Salagama entrepreneur, Dines de Zoysa, and led by Ambagahapitiye Nanavimala, set off to Amarapura in Burma, where the new sect was inaugurated. They returned four years later. However, given that official recognition from the Colonial Office was not forthcoming, another monk, Ven. Kapugama Dhammakhanda Thera, financed by another Salagama entrepreneur, Adrian de Abrew, set off to Amarapura, to return two years later in 1809. By the time official recognition did come, through an Act of Appointment issued in 1825, Ven. Dhammakhanda Thera, nine years earlier, had renounced Buddhism and accepted Christianity. This is where we should resume. 
Historians and sociologists tend to view colonial Sri Lankan society in terms of a series of encounters between Govigama and Karava, or between the landowning aristocracy and the arrack renters. Consequently, the evolution of the Salagama as a distinct caste has been neglected in scholarship, with the result being that even such seminal works as Kumari Jayawardanas Nobodies to Somebodies fails to account for the rise in Salagama consciousness during the Dutch occupation. This is a rather curious omission, and reasons for it are hard to find. Regardless of those reasons though, I believe that such an omission is unpardonable when assessing the divisions of the Buddhist order during the early decades of British rule. Since the Siyam Nikaya were adamant on not opening the Upasampada to members of outside castes, two upasampada ceremonies predating the Amarapura Nikaya were conducted in 1772 at the Thotagamuwa Raja Maha Viharaya in Thelwatte, Galle, and in 1798 at Tangalle. 
What was so significant about the Amarapura Nikaya, then First and foremost, it marked the first time that a rebel sect had been inaugurated with the express consent of the powers at the time. Its reasonable to assume that the British would have had a vested interest in segmenting the Buddhist order, in the hopes of fragmenting a belief that had already taken on a caste-ist character, but it is a mistake to think that such an act of segmentation would not have occurred without British intervention. Even without them, the pressures on the order from caste interests could not be withstood. 
Secondly, the Amarapura Nikaya was the first sect to emerge from an entrepreneurial class. Those who view colonial history in terms of a rift between Govigama and Karava fail to consider or omit altogether the fact that the Salagamas forged ahead as a capitalist class long before the Karavas began to prosper through the arrack rent. What this obviously necessitated was a shift in the way the new Buddhist order, built on the patronage of powerful Salagama headmen and entrepreneurs, especially with regard to its complete autonomy from a monarch, Sri Lankan or British. Given this autonomy, it had virtual carte blanche to move forward with a reformist agenda. In other words, as Prof. Kitsiri Malalgoda has argued in his book Buddhism in Sinhalese Society, It successfully questioned for the first time the right of secular authorities to regulate the affairs of the order. 
Changes in economic landscape
It was as reformist as it was sectarian, and like the Protestant Reformation in Europe, it coincided with changes in the economic landscape; the decline of the traditional elite (soon to morph into a landowning class courtesy of the British), and the rise of a new elite (though the Salagamas had more or less consolidated economic power before British rule). 
Where it differed from the reformist and sectarian movements in Christian Europe, however, was that it wasnt inaugurated with the objective of establishing a religion and priesthood for all, i.e. for the peasantry. It was defined in relation to and against the Establishment, but this didnt mean that it flirted with radicalism the way that, for instance, Thomas Mntzer did when he rebelled against both the Catholic Church and Martin Luther. In fact, as Regi Siriwardena argued in a reply to Kumari Jayawardana, it is difficult to ascertain whether the Buddhist priesthood in Sri Lanka ever produced the equivalent of a Mntzer or for that matter Martin Luther. Even with the setting up of the Amarapura Nikaya, its primary objective was to reform the order in line with the historical antecedents of Buddhism, as reflected (or refracted) through its tenets. Where are the radical Buddhists Siriwardena once asked. It is a question which has invited both censure and praise, and has divided scholars over the decades. 
From one standpoint, it has been argued that Buddhism here was infected with the remnants of feudal society. This school of thought discounts the Buddhist revival of the 19th century on the basis that it did not do away with the separation between the clergy and the laity. Personally, I do not think that the contention that Buddhist radicalism as understood by Western scholars didnt come about totally is reason enough to conclude that the Buddhist order sought to preserve feudal structures at whatever cost. This is where we must credit the Amarapura Nikaya, because for the first time in the history of the Buddhist order, it brought forth (as Professor Malalgoda observes) closer cooperation between the monks and their devotees. This had less to do with an overt objective by those monks to erase caste distinctions than with the fact of their own meagre historical condition; given that it had no royal patronage, the Amarapura Nikaya was compelled to rely on the lay devotee. As an anthropologist once wrote, moreover, this had an impact on the way even the Govigamas saw it: I know many villagers of the Govigama caste who prefer to give alms to monks of the Amarapura or Ramanya Nikaya rather than those of the Siyam Nikaya because they believe that the former are less worldly. Here, then, was a Buddhism that promised people salvation in this present birth, as opposed to the more conservative Buddhism which gained prominence among urban followers in the latter part of the 19th century. 
Salvation, in other words, would come about through this birth and this world, not ones next birth. It encouraged affirmative action and dissension, gave equal weight to prathipaththi (principles) and amisa pooja (making offerings), and encouraged a new spirit and culture of revivalism. Its here that we see the seeds that were later sown by the Anagarika Dharmapala, with a monastic order that, while certainly not radical like its counterparts in the West, sought to combat the other-worldliness the domineering sects had encouraged in their devotees. What this resulted in was a sharp awareness of the need to oppose external forces which had harmed the faith, and the Amarapura Nikaya took this point to heart so much that one Christian missionary contended that it was At present the most prominent in controversy, street preaching, and all that is aggressive. But long before this anti-imperialist streak came about, the Amarapura Nikaya had to wade through decades of infighting; something I intend on exploring in my next piece on the subject.

Uni. protests are politically funded: Wijeyadasa
	
The university protests carried out by the university students were politically funded, Higher Education & Cultural Affairs Minister Dr. Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe said yesterday.
Addressing a news briefing, he said it had become an issue to maintain the discipline at the university education due to the intervention of the political groups whose aspiration was to create political turmoil.
There are groups who fund in millions for these university students to organize their protest march. Majority of the students who are involved in these protest campaigns, are not university students, Minister Rajapakshesaid.
He said much of the protest marches are not carried out with pure intention to meet out justice but to fulfill political aspirations.
Meanwhile, he said the ragging had become a major issue in the universities where a lot of students had been inconvenienced owing to physical and sexual harassment.
We are to carry out stringent actions on ragging in line with the Ragging Act, he said.
He said a phone line 011-2123700is available 24 hours to lodge complaints in relation to ragging incidents. (Sheain Fernandopulle)

Unrealistic to have higher ratio for direct taxation- Bandula
	
SL bound to face the worst debt-crisisin2025
	*The private sector even covers farmers, small and medium entrepreneurs, retailers, wholesale traders, importers and exporters
	They all had a bitter attitude towards the private sector. They vented their anger against the private sector in that manner
	Government has got everything confused. With only a tax revenue of one trillion, the Rajapaksa Government financed the war... against terrorism
	The reports submitted by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe regarding debts are totally false.

Joint Opposition MP Bandula Gunawardane, in an interview with the Daily mirror , speaks on the economic situation of the country and the impact of recenttax reforms.
Excerpts:
QThe Government has introduced a new tax policy. It is to increase the percentage of direct tax revenue for the State coffers. How do you view it
It is an unfair strategy to raise revenue. According to my knowledge, Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera lacks theoretical knowledge on direct and indirect taxation. In the countries such as those in the SAARC region, it is economically unrealistic to maintain direct taxation at 40 per cent and indirect taxation at 60 per cent.
QWhy do you say so
There is a tax base. Direct taxation is done proportionate to peoples income and profit levels, and their properties. We do not have a large social segment here in Sri Lanka with a firm economic footing to pay direct taxes as a large percentage. Sri Lanka made an economic leap after the end of the war in 2009 under the Mahinda Rajapaksa rule and became a lower middle-income country. Until such time, our annual Gross Domestic Production (GDP) remained at less than the US $ 25 billion, be it under a closed economic system or an open economic system. In the post-war era, the GDP rose to US $ 82 billion by 2014 when the Rajapaksa era ended. Only in a higher middle-income country or a developed country, can 40 per cent ratio direct taxation be expected. It is realistically possible in countries such as the United States, the United Kingdom, Malaysia and Switzerland. These countries have their tax bases which are economically well-off. Our tax base is small. If we increase direct taxation, our industrialists and landed proprietors will be liable for taxes more and more. If the Government heaps them with a tax upon taxes, they will get a severe beating in the economic sense.

The private sector is the engine of growth in the economy. When we mention the private sector, a petty-minded JVP member would think of company giants. The private sector even covers farmers, small and medium entrepreneurs, retailers, wholesale traders, importers...
QIn contrast, the increase of indirect taxation will result in the price hike of food commodities and all. Isnt it an advantage to have a higher ratio direct taxation
If we levy Rs. 25 on a kilogramme of sugar, it will be a huge tax burden for someone earning Rs.1,000 per day, for example. Yet, for someone with a daily income of Rs.100, 000, it is not a burden. That is the end result of indirect taxation. There is a heavy tax burden on the lower-income groups and less burden on the high-income groups. If we exempt essential items from taxation altogether, we can avoid such impact. Another measure to mitigate the impact is high taxation on luxury items. Or else, subsidies should be given to low-income groups. In the developing countries, the increase of direct taxation is not economically advisable in the long run.
The private sector is the engine of growth in the economy. When we mention the private sector, a petty-minded JVP member would think of company giants. The private sector even covers farmers, small and medium entrepreneurs, retailers, wholesale traders, importers, exporters and service suppliers.
If you burden the private sector with large taxation, investment will be discouraged. It will reduce employment opportunities eventually. We have to implement the tax policy in a manner that will not discourage investments.
The United National Party (UNP), in a clear departure from their past attitude, launched a scathing attack on the private sector after assuming office in 2015.
The entire country was bustling with economic activities before 2015. Those, engaged in such private sector economic activities, were dubbed fraudsters by then Minister Ravi Karunanayake.
They were accused of having ill-gotten wealth. He imposed the Super Gain Tax with retrospective effect. Investment dropped by Rs. 50 billion as a result during that year. There were a few other similar taxes such as Mansion Tax imposed totally out of venom, targeting theprivate sector.
The directors of leading companies were hauled before the Financial Crimes Investigation Division (FCID).
The Government implemented the 100-Day-Programme. It is a programme worked out by JVP leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake, former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga, the NGO representatives and the UNP. They all had a bitter attitude towards the private sector. They vented their anger against the private sector in that manner.
QTaxation is needed to raise revenue for the Government. Yet, people are also burdened by taxation. What do you propose to reconcile both of them if you are opposed to tax reforms in this manner
The management of expenditures as proportionate to the income level is what matters here in economics. That is the fiscal management that applies even to a family, individual or any company. It is macro-prudential economic management needed in this regard. There are families with a monthly income of Rs.40, 000. Yet, they manage their household incomes well. They sometimes do not borrow even a single cent from anyone.
They are very economical in their expenses. Many such families cannot afford to dine out. They do not consume bottled water. For a middle-income family with a monthly income of Rs.100, 000, it is different. Such a family can afford to do so many things. Yet, even if the family with such a high income is not frugal enough in its expenses, it will be compelled to make borrowings from friends and relatives to make ends meet.
There are persons with their monthly incomes running to the tune of millions of rupees. Yet, they sometimes are addicted to gambling and betting. Then, life will be more difficult for them than for the two income categories I mentioned now. So, what matters is striking a balance between the income and expenses.

If you burden the private sector with large taxation, investment will be discouraged. It will reduce employment opportunities eventually. We have to implement the tax policy in a manner that will not discourage investments
QFor the Government, it is different. It has to spend on essential services somehow or the other. What is your response
This Government has got everything confused. With only a tax revenue of one trillion rupees, the Rajapaksa Government financed the war
against terrorism.
It successfully warded off the impact of the world fuel crisis at that time. Now, there is an increase in tax revenue due to the latest tax reforms. Alongside, the present Government has two advantages. There is no need to finance the war effort. Also, the fuel prices have dropped in the world market. Despite all these advantages, the Government cannot manage the economy today.
During the last three years, the Government was able to save only US $ 5.1 billion from its oil import bills because of low prices in the world market.
QThe Government says it has to spend a lot on debt-servicing. According to the Government, the repayment of some of the loans raised during your tenure has started only now. What do you say about it
It is a fiction. The reports submitted by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe regarding debts are totally false. I never believed that the Prime Minister would tell such lies. The Prime Minister said the State revenue was insufficient to pay loan instalments.
In 2014, the State revenue accounted for Rs.1,195 billion. For debt-servicing, that Government spent Rs.1,076 billion. Under the new Government in 2016, the State revenue rose to Rs.1,454 billion. It costs Rs.1,317 billion only for debt servicing. The trend continued.
The State revenue in 2016 was Rs.1,686 billion. For debt servicing, Rs.1,352 billion was spent on the repayment of loan and loan instalments.
In 2017, the Government gained Rs.1,837 billion. Debt-servicing cost Rs.1,603 billion. It is incorrect to say that income was insufficient to pay taxes. It is clear that the Government imposed unfair tax hikes not to settle loans.
When the Rajapaksa Government assumed office, the total debt component stood at Rs. 2 trillion. When his term ended by 2015, it was Rs.7 trillion. There is an increase of five trillion rupees during the ten-year period.
The debt component is as high as Rs.11 trillion. It has shot up by Rs.4.5 trillion during the last three and half years under the new regime. Otherwise, there is an unrealistic fear whipped up by the Government about a debt burden. Debt burden is cited as the reason for all the economic ills of the country. Yet, it is not the real case.
Actually, Sri Lanka is bound to face the worst debt crisis in 2025 according to economic forecasts. We will be compelled to grapple with it.

QYou have been subjected to humiliation because of your remarks that Rs. 2,500 would suffice for anyone to live for one month. How can you support
your remarks
Actually, I put a Cabinet Paper asking for the increase of allowances being given to students of the National Colleges of Education from Rs.2,500 to 3,000. What I said was that such a student was making a hand-to-mouth living with Rs.2,500 without dying.
Critics interpreted it in different ways. I was politically slandered.
QYou are critical of the Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with Singapore. It has already been signed as a bilateral agreement. How can it be reversed
Professional groups have moved the court in this regard. It was worked out and signed with educating peopleand Parliament.
This has been signed without amendments being incorporated. It was done hastily. There are conditions stipulated by the World Trade Organization (WTO) to be fulfilled in signing a service agreement. There are six aspects. One is the mandate. Others include transparency, human rights, accountability, and interface. In this instance, there are no transparency, accountability and the employment of human resources. The service sector will be opened in this instance. This agreement is proposed to be valid for an indefinite period.



There is a heavy tax burden on the low-income groups and less burden on the high-income groups. If we exempt essential items from taxation altogether, we can avoid such impact

Will surround Presidential Secretariat if Pera. Medical faculty not opened: PUMS
	
The Presidential Secretariat would be surrounded by University students and their parents next week if the authorities fail to reopen the Medical Faculty of Peradeniya University, the Parents' Union of Medical Students (PUMS) said yesterday.
Addressing a press conference, PUMS Spokesman Wasantha Alwis said based on an incident that occurred in the Engineering Faculty, the university was closed for two months and it was an injustice to students of other faculties who were not involved.
Mr. Alwis explained that due to the SAITM controversy and the university non-academic staffs protests students education was disrupted for months and the decision to close the university for two months will further hamper their education.
As such, he said the unhappy parents will stage protests with the support of the university students throughout the week and will surround the Presidential Secretariat next week.
He said that the authorities have enough time until Monday to reopen the university before they engage in the protest. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
