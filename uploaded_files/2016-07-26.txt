A revealing truth why many attend functions
	
?
A Bodhi Pooja pinkama was held recently to invoke blessings on a leading political figure in the country and the organizers were highly disappointed at the poor turnout at the ceremony despite the pre-publicity given to the event.
?
The fact that the ceremony was held without the presence of the head of the institution which took the initiative to organize the event, accounted for the poor turnout, they say.
?If the Lokka was present, at least the employees would have turned up to show their face to him,? an organizer observed.

Asian markets drift as dealers await bank meetings
	
AFP - Asian equity traders moved cautiously yesterday as another record close on Wall Street was offset by wariness ahead of Central Bank meetings in Japan and the United States this week.
The bank policymakers? gatherings are the first since last month?s shock vote in Britain to leave the European Union, which led to promises around the world to provide support to financial markets.
The pledges have fanned a surge across global markets, with the Dow and S&P 500 in New York both enjoying a series of records, while strong US data has also boosted the dollar as talk of another interest rate hike resurfaces.
The Bank of Japan is widely expected to ramp up its stimulus to kickstart the struggling economy, although hoped-for helicopter money -- the direct injection of cash into the economy such as people?s bank accounts -- is not expected to feature. Before that, the Federal Reserve will have its meeting, at which it is tipped to hold rates, but traders will be hoping for some forward guidance on its policy plans. ?Investors are placing a lot of faith in central banks and fiscal authorities to increase stimulus and improve the growth calculus,? Matthew Sherwood, head of investment strategy at Perpetual Ltd. in Sydney, said in an e-mail to clients.
?Equity valuations are stretched but unlike bonds they are not yet at historic extremes and given that it has historically taken three rate hikes to burst equity asset bubbles, share prices should remain elevated for a while yet.?

BIA closed for renovations for 3 months
	
The main runway of the Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA) would be closed for three months from January 5 next year for renovations, Transport Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva said today.
He said it would be closed from 8.30 am to 4.30 pm every day for those three months.
?The BIA will be closed for eight hours a day during which a selected area of the runway would be renovated for four hours and allowed to cool down for another four hours,? the Minister said.
A Netherland advisory team has been selected for the renovation project through a tender procedure.
The Minister told a media briefing that flights could be allowed to land at the BIA for about another one year according to International Air Transport regulation because the runway had not been renovated since 1958.
Work on a new Airport Terminal would also begin at the BIA next year. A concessionary loan agreement for Rs. 56 million was signed on March 24 between Airport and Aviation Services Ltd. and Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) to expand the capacity of the BIA.
The new terminal would be built with a grant of US$ 800 million from the JICA. It has been planned to complete the terminal within two years. The new multi-level terminal with an approximate floor area of 180,000 square metres where arrivals and departures are separated vertically would provide capacity of handling 15 million passengers per year. The project would include 23 aircraft parking stands with additional 96 check-in counters, eight baggage claim belts, seven baggage make-up carousels, 16 contact boarding gates with 28 passenger boarding bridges and six bus gates.

France church attack: Priest killed in hostage-taking
	
A priest has been killed in an attack by two armed men at his church near Rouen in northern France, police and French media have said.
The armed men entered the church in Saint-Etienne-du-Rouvray during Mass, taking the priest and four other people hostage, the interior ministry said.
French TV said shots had been heard after police arrived at the scene. Both hostage-takers are now dead.
The area has been cordoned off and police have told people to stay away.
French interior ministry spokesman, Pierre-Henri Brandet, said one of the hostages had been critically wounded.
He said the hostage-takers had been "neutralised" after coming out of the church. Police were now searching the church for explosives.
'Barbaric'
Mr Brandet said the motive of the attackers was not immediately clear, but the investigation into the incident would be led by anti-terrorism prosecutors.
French Prime Minister Manuel Valls has expressed his horror at the "barbaric attack".
"The whole of France and all Catholics are wounded. We will stand together," he wrote on Twitter.
President Francois Hollande and Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve are on their way to Saint-Etienne-du-Rouvray to be briefed by police.
A woman who works at a local beauty parlour, Eulalie Garcia, said she had known the 92-year-old priest since her childhood.
"My family has lived here for 35 years and we have always known him," she said.
"He was someone who was treasured by the community. He was very discreet and didn't like to draw attention to himself."
There was no immediate word on the identity of the hostage-takers, but France has been on high alert since the Bastille Day attack in Nice earlier this month, when a man ploughed a lorry into celebrating crowds, killing more than 80 people.
The Nice attack was carried out by Tunisian Mohamed Lahouaiej-Bouhlel, who was not a known jihadist but so-called Islamic State said he had acted in response to its calls to target civilians in countries that have been attacking it.
The BBC's Lucy Williamson in Paris says the French government has been under huge pressure to prevent further attacks. (BBC)

Ministry of Defence (MOD) said today that they were in the process of introducing a pension scheme for retired disabled tri-force members and police personnel but said an exact time frame cannot be revealed at this level.
A group of retired disabled military and police personnel launched a protest on Monday (25) urging the President to intervene in the proposed pension scheme.
?Procedure to introduce the pension scheme could take some time. However, we hope to resolve the issue as soon as possible and the President too had directed us to find immediate solution to the issue,? Public relation officer to the Defence Secretary Brigadier Prasanna Chandrasekara said.
He said the MOD in collaboration with the Pension Department, tri-forces and the Finance Ministry had finalised the mechanism to resolve the issue.
He said they have found solutions to 17 out of 20 requests of the protesters and solutions to the remaining three requests which were delayed because it needed intervention of other authorities including the Finance Ministry.
Meanwhile, Brigadier Sanath Perera said retired disabled military and police personnel who have not completed 10 and 12 years service were not entitled to the pension but a special monthly allowance were receiving when they turn 55 years.
He said nearly 4,000 retired disabled military and police personnel who have not completed their service were not receiving the pension after age 55.
Military Spokesmen Brigadier Jayanath Jayaweera, Navy Spokesman Captain Akram Alavi and Air Force Spokesman Group Captain Chandima Alwis participated at the media briefing held at the MOD media centre today.

Murali creating long-term damage for himself among his fans: Thilanga
	
Sri Lanka?s cricket board lodged a complaint Monday with the visiting Australians after their bowling consultant and local legend Muttiah Muralitharan was involved in a bust-up with his former colleagues.
On the eve of the first of three Tests, board president Thilanga Sumathipala accused Muralitharan of insulting Sri Lanka team manager Charith Senanayake in a row over the Australians? use of a practice pitch in Colombo. ?
?Muralitharan?s behaviour is unacceptable and we have brought this to the notice of the Australian team management,? Sumathipala told reporters. ?It should not have happened. We are very disappointed.?
Sumathipala said it was ironic that Muralitharan was coaching a team from Australia given his history. ?
?Professionally it is okay for Murali to coach any foreign team, but the irony is that he is supporting Australia which tried to get him out of cricket,? Sumathipala said. ?
?He is creating long-term damage for himself among his fans.?
During an 18-year Test career, Muralitharan -- who was born with a partially deformed elbow -- was twice cited by Australian umpires for a suspect action but he was cleared both times by the game?s governing body.??? ?
Sumathipala said Muralitharan had bullied groundsmen at the Pallekele Stadium on Saturday into allowing the Australians to practise there when it was theoretically off limits to both teams. ?
?He rode roughshod over the groundsmen and got his (Australian) players to practise in violation of the time stipulations,? Sumathipala said. ?He later confronted our team manager (Senanayake) and abused him.?
Senanayake refused to comment but a source close to the team said the manager and Muralitharan had exchanged words on Saturday at Pallekele stadium, on the outskirts of Kandy, which is hosting the first Test.

No SLFP CC approval to extend UNP-SLFP agreement- JO
	
Neither the Sri Lanka Freedom Party Central Committee (SLFP CC) nor the Executive Committee had approved the extension of the agreement entered into with the United National Party (UNP) for five years, SLFP MPs of the joint opposition (JO) said today.
JO national organizer and SLFP CC member Dullas Alahapperuma said there were five MPs in the joint opposition, who represent the SLFP CC and they had not wetted any proposal to extend the agreement.
?Not even the Parliament Select Committee had been consulted prior to announcing that the two parties will continue to serve a full term of five years despite the signed agreement. This is something the party secretary had said and we expressed our objection to such a notion when we met the President on Monday night. When the agreement was signed a year ago, our consent was sought. The CC was consulted even though we had rejected the agreement,? he told a news conference yesterday.
Mr. Alahapperuma said there were allegations against the JO that its MPs were fulfilling the terms of a contract signed with the UNP and now it?s evident who had undertaken a contract from whom.
Meanwhile, commenting on possible disciplinary action by the SLFP on its MPs in the JO for taking part in the ?Jana Satana Paada Yathra?, Mr. Alahapperuma said they were not violating any party discipline by attending the walk.
?People didn?t elect us to join the UNP and form coalitions. We even informed the President that we will use any opportunity and platform we receive to defeat the UNP,? he said.
Meanwhile, JO leader and MP Dinesh Gunawardena said there were attempts by the UNP-led government to sabotage the ?Paada Yathrawa? but said they would continue with their move despite any sabotage attempts.
The JO said a UNP bigwig with many coordinating secretaries had reserved public grounds in an attempt to sabotage the Paada Yathrawa. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

PM?s remarks on media - Silence by Western Missions a shocker: JO
	
The joint opposition said today it was shocked by the ?deafening? silence of the Western missions over the statements made by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe last week threatening newspaper editors.
Former MP G.L. Peiris accused the government of giving priority to carry out the Western agendas rather than fulfilling the aspirations of the people of Sri Lanka.
?This is why these missions remain silence. However, Western missions along with others readily criticized the previous government,? he said and added that they were appalled by the statements made by the Prime Minister threatening editors and announcing his intention of naming and shaming other media personnel who have incurred his displeasure.
?In the case of one Editor of a leading newspaper, the Prime Minister specifically stated that if the Editor in question does not quit his post, methods would have to be found to get rid of him. The language used in these pronouncements, which received the widest exposure, was undignified and intemperate in the extreme,? Mr. Peiris said.
He said similar threats have been uttered, with remarkable impunity, against the electronic media as well and added that they deeply regretted that a government which was elected on a platform of commitment to democratic values and media freedom is today resorting to intimidation on a scale which has brought about an environment of the most repulsive inhibition which makes it not merely difficult but virtually impossible for conscientious journalists to perform their functions without fear.

The political stalwart of this story was an uncrowned king of yesteryear.

A dog lover, the political bigwig was the owner of two mongrels brought up in air-conditioned comfort. Each of them was worth about Rs.700,000, they say.?

Singapore to shame other errant banks after 1MDB saga
	
AFP - Singapore?s Central Bank chief vowed yesterday to name and shame other banks engaged in money-laundering after a scandal involving Malaysian state fund 1MDB hurt the city-state?s financial reputation.
The money-laundering lapses uncovered during a 15-month investigation into fund flows linked to 1MDB are ?simply unacceptable?, Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) managing director Ravi Menon told a press briefing.?
?There is no doubt that the recent findings have made a dent on our reputation as a clean and trusted financial centre,? he said.?
At the time of the transactions, it was not apparent to financial regulators worldwide that the fund flows were illicit, he said, adding that clues only started to emerge in 2014 -- some four years after the earliest transactions. MAS began investigations in 2015, Menon said, declining to comment further because of continuing probes.
The MAS, which regulates the financial sector and also functions as Singapore?s Central Bank, said it would be stepping up enforcement.?
While previous regulatory dealings with errant financial institutions were kept confidential, Menon said some of them would now be named in public, especially in areas concerning money-laundering and terrorism financing.?
?We are beginning to take a different tack because I think naming and shaming hurts them more than financial penalties,? he said.?
In a joint statement with the police and the Attorney-General?s Chambers last week, the MAS revealed it had seized nearly $180 million in assets through investigations into 1MDB. Half of these were linked to Low Taek Jho, a Malaysian businessman and a close family friend of embattled Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak. It came one day after the US Justice Department moved to seize more than $1 billion in assets allegedly bought with money stolen from 1MDB.
Singapore in May kicked out Switzerland?s BSI Bank over ?gross misconduct? linked to 1MDB.?
Swiss financial regulators later dissolved the bank for similar reasons.
Singapore authorities last week also said investigations found that Singapore-based DBS Bank, Standard Chartered Bank?s Singapore Branch and Swiss-based UBS had exhibited ?undue delay in detecting and reporting suspicious transactions?.?
It also noted lapses by Swiss bank Falcon PBS, saying it was still investigating them.
An ex-BSI banker and another man have been charged in a Singapore court with various offences and several others are being questioned.

SLC doesn?t know Cricket- Arjuna
	
While admitting that he wouldn?t have accepted the consulting role to Cricket Australia former Sri Lankan Cricket Captain Arjuna Ranathunga said that Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) is to blame for eliminating coaching opportunities to locals, compelling them to find employment overseas.
?If I was Murali I wouldn?t have accepted the job. However, this issue has different sides and it must be looked at wholly? he said.
Ranathunga addressing the media at the Grand Oriental Hotel regarding the current situation of Cricket in Sri Lanka,said that the employment by Cricket Australia is clear vindication of Muralitharans innocence.
? It was the Australian Cricket Board which hammered Murali and called him everything that was despicable. The very fact that they have employed him is clear vindication of our position, that we were right all along about his innocence and our fight? he said.
He however asserted that, it was Sri Lanka Cricket to blame for eliminating all former players who were coaches, and retained only those who were servile to the administration.
? Following the recent elections, the administrators have taken off all former world cup winning players from their coaching roles. Chaminda Vaas, Upul Chandana, Eric Upashantha, Ravindra Pushpakumara and even the Chairman of the Selection Committee Sanath Jayasuriya were all removed. They have only kept those who are servile to them? he said.
Taking swipes at his rival the current President of Sri Lanka Cricket Thilanga Sumathipala, Ranathunga said the current administration does not understand the sport.
? These people don?t know anything about Cricket, which is why even people like Mahela who coached England had to do that. He also faced the same issue. Fact is that they are not being given an opportunity here and therefore they have to go overseas to pursue their profession? he said.
He further iterated that the cricket team needs to be mentored and coached by locals.
? We need local coaches and we should make as much use as possible from our former players? he said.
