THE HINDU, 28th MARCH, 2018- The United States continues to move forward on the proposed summit meeting between President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, the White House has said.
White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders on Tuesday told reporters that preparations were on for the summit, which had been accepted by Mr. Trump at the request of Pyongyang.
?We are continuing to move forward. The offer was extended and accepted, and were continuing to move forward in that process. We still don?t have a set time or date on that front,? Ms. Sanders said in response to a question.
State Department Spokesperson Heather Nauert had more or less a similar statement to offer during a news conference.

Reflection for Holy Thursday today Jesus and Foot-Washing A Lesson Taught but Hardly Learnt
	
When Pope Francis washed the feet of prisoners including a Muslim girl on Holy Thursday in the first year of his papacy, quite a few clergymen both here and abroad were shocked by what they thought was a flagrant violation of liturgical norms and a disregard for Jesus? alleged (but not scripturally recorded) intention that only men? be the recipients of this service.Holders of such views and attitudes have failed to grasp the revolutionary message Jesus has communicated to all generations by this gesture --- a gesture that Pope Francis has re-enacted with an equally revolutionary effect. To appreciate this message one must delve into the culture as well as the scriptures of the Jews.? ?
Cultural and Scriptural Background of Foot-washing
In the dry and dusty region of ancient Israel it was customary to wash the feet of guests on entering a house. Both hygiene and hospitality demanded it. Yet an unholy tradition dictated that this service had to be performed only by a female slave; and in the absence of a female slave, a female member of the family had to step in. In fact in his letter to Timothy, St Paul mentions widows who continued to render that same service. No male member nor a fortiori, the male head of the family, would ever compromise his male superiority by indulging in a ?menial service?allegedly suited only for slaves and women! Thus both gender and class discrimination marred this otherwise commendable practice.? ?
But Jesus who hosted his disciples to a meal stunned them by doing what he always did: flouting discriminatory laws at the risk of scandalizing the sanctimonious hypocrites. We hail Pope Francis for doing the same.By washing the feet of prisoners including Muslim women, this Pope, too, countered both gender and class taboos just as Jesus did.St Paul puts it well: In Christ (therefore among Christians) there is no discrimination in terms of gender (?male or female?) class (?free or slave?) and ethnicity (Jew or gentile).? ?
John?s description of the event --- if interpreted according to the cultural mores mentioned above--- suggests that Jesus had assumed the posture of a domestic woman-slave in that he removed the over-garment, took up a towel and knelt down before the guests to wash their feet. Observe that this ?service? (abodah in Hebrew) which Jesus performed? voluntarily out of sheer love was the same?service?(abodah) that women slaves did compulsorily under social pressure. To fathom the spiritual depth of this self-effacingly bold gesture of Jesus we must comprehend the three meanings which the Bible gives to the Hebrew word abodah, which literally means ?service?. For abodah could denote any one of the following types of service: (a) voluntary service rendered out of love to other humans, specially to the needy; (b)slavery or forced labour,i.e., a service unjustly imposed on others by loveless people ; (c) Divine Service. i.e., worship of the one true God. The Bible transmits a very profound teaching on justice and love by the way it employs these three meanings of ?service?(abodah).? ?
In the Book of Exodus, God is shown to be moved by compassion to liberate the Israelites from Egyptian ?slavery? (abodah), and calls them to freedom that they might render unto God the ?service?due to Her, namely, ?worship? (abodah). The implication is that abodah as worship of God is not compatible with abodah as slavery or compulsive labour. It is only abodah as loving service towards needy humans that accord with abodah which is divine worship. Hence any attempt to worship God without engaging oneself in loving service towards other humans ceases to be abodah (worship) and becomes a mere sheret (?ritual?).? ?
No wonder we hear the Prophets such as Amos, Hosea and others castigating those Israelites who indulged in temple worship without caring for the needy or meting out justice to the oppressed.Theirs was a severe warning that true worship of God (abodah) goes hand in hand with service (abodah) to victims of poverty and injustice. This is the biblical background which explains the true meaning of what happened on that Holy Thursday, as we are about to see.? ?
But Jesus who hosted his disciples to a meal stunned them by doing what he always did: flouting discriminatory laws at the risk of scandalizing the sanctimonious hypocrites?
From Ritual (sheret) back to Service (abodah)
Note well that John does not describe the Last Supper (unlike the other evangelists) and, in its stead, he goes out of his way to mention the Foot-Washing,? which certainly took place in the context of the Last Supper. Instead of the words ?Do this in memory of me? referring to the sharing of bread and wine as his body and blood, Jesus is heard saying, ?Do as I have done to you? referring to his washing of their feet. The Christ-event is to be remembered not only by enacting the Last Supper but also by imitating Jesus who humbled himself in the service of his subordinates. . Both the Eucharistic meal and mutual service are inseparable expressions of Love which alone saves.? ?
Then why did John de-emphasize the Communal Meal and accentuated abodah which, according to the Scriptures, is at once worship of God and service to humans? St Paul helps us to find out why. Writing only about twenty years after Christ?s death, Paul expresses his shock on hearing that the Lord?s Supper, as celebrated in the Corinthian church, had ceased to be an authentic worship and had degenerated into a mere rite marred by a scandalous class division between the rich Christians who ate and drank sumptuously and the poor Christians who were starving. A Love Feast without love is a sacrilege! No wonder Paul condemned their Eucharistic worship as a sin, more precisely, ?a sin against the Body of the Lord? ! Like the old Prophets, Paul could not tolerate Christians who would take part in divine worship while being discriminative towards those that are not of their social standing.AEucharistic celebration which ceases to be an authentic abodah (divine worship accompanied by human service) is no more than a meaningless ?ritual? (sheret), nay, a sin!? ?
Now we can imagine the sorry state of this Holy Meal about thirty, forty or more years after Paul?s lament, i.e., when John compiled the Fourth Gospel. Hence it would seem that this evangelist wanted to re-emphasize the service dimension of divine worship and redeem the churches from their ritualism. He seems to insist that mutual service done in a spirit of humility and equality is an essential ingredient of Christian worship and that its absence in Christian communities had deprived their Eucharistic celebration of its basic constituent, namely, service-filled worship or sacrificing one?s life (flesh and blood) for others in accordance with the Master?s command and example. Foot-washing is recorded in order to remind the churches of John?s time that Divine Worship and Human Service are inseparably associated with each other. What God has put together let no one put asunder!? ?
Let me conclude with a caveat. The foot-washing also risks being ritualized into an annual ceremony unless the churches see it as a divine summons to create Christian communities wherein mutual service eliminates every shade of discrimination in terms of gender, class and ethnicity. This is quite clearly suggested by the afore-mentioned socio-cultural context in which Jesus gave us an example of abodah, Loving Service to Humans as a constitutive dimension of Divine worship.]? ?

Rosy Senanayake believes Colombo could be better than Malaysia
	
Colombo?s first female Mayor Rosy Senanayake assumed duties last week and is in the process of ?setting things right? at the Colombo Municipal Council (CMC). During the run-up to the elections, Senanayake presented an elaborate manifesto addressing various issues in and around Colombo. One of her primary focuses includes developing underserved development areas. ?The beauty of Colombo is that it?s a multi-religious, multi-ethnic and multi-cultural city,? she said in an interview with the Daily Mirror.?Excerpts:?
?
We are contracted to provide 700 metric tonnes of mixed garbage for this project by August 2019
	The Govt. has identified Aruwakkalu as a permanent dumping place
	The Govt. is in the process of streamlining the property registration process in the CMC
	We have a waste-to-energy project which the Municipality has signed with a private entity
	Social welfare projects would be concentrated 100% on these underserved development areas
?
?Q? What are the immediate challenges that you have faced and would address in the near future?
We have actually looked at a few (challenges), but garbage remains our number one priority. We had a meeting with the Prime Minister last week because we faced a crisis situation since the authorities at Muthurajawela stopped collecting mixed waste. We then had to negotiate with the Minister and within 48 hours we dumped the collection. I also believe that the residents have a responsibility in segregating the garbage. I have informed the Municipality to educate the residents because they cannot haphazardly dispose of garbage. We have a waste-to-energy project which the Municipality has signed with a private entity which would get off the ground by the end of 2019. A meeting was held and this will continue every month to see how far they have progressed. We are contracted to provide 700 metric tonnes of mixed garbage for this project by August 2019. By then I believe that most of our problems would be solved given that this project takes off.? ?
In the past, the Governments had not realized how waste could be a money-spinner. There are many facets and uses of waste. We also have had discussions to improve the health and sanitation sector next. The dengue mosquito and the epidemic normally happen in a cycle of twice every year. So we are getting ready to minimize the effects of breeding grounds. The Government is in the process of streamlining the property registration process in the CMC. The project spearheaded by the Ministry of Development Strategies and International Trade is aimed at enhancing investment climate and paving the way for taxpayers to receive an efficient service at comparatively less cost. For this there are three stakeholders namely the Registrar General?s Office, the CMC and the Survey Department. We just signed the MoU with them. For the time being it?s a manual process and earlier to register the property in Colombo it took more than 30 days. The MoU will enable us to share information among all stakeholders. We are also preparing for Vesak.
As Sri Lankans we need to celebrate all festivals. The beauty of Colombo is that it?s a multi-religious, multi-ethnic and multi-cultural city and we have always lived in harmony no matter what happens in the rest of the country. Hence, we have co-existed and therefore we need to celebrate each one?s cultural background and customs. There will be open houses and the municipality will encourage co-existence among different cultural communities. We are looking at the housing, underserved settlements and their needs etc.? ?
We have already appointed a committee to empower women and look into their needs and bring in multi-serving and multi-purpose community centres
?Q? The CMC was in the news for several incidents related to bribery and corruption. How would you streamline the activities within?the Council??
Firstly it is about bringing in e-governance and instilling discipline in the Council. I?m also working on a mechanism to bring everyone to work, hence improving the quality of work. I also need to establish a Human Resource Department because roughly about 9000 people work here and there?s also a need to establish a few departments which are not in existence at the moment. Then we also could look at the social welfare and reward people for the work that they do, give them the incentives to come to work and put the place right.?
They need to work with the correct frame of mind. If I am to train them on how to think creative and think global and move from where we are then I would do that as well. I strongly believe that Colombo could be better than Singapore or Malaysia. A little bit of effort and leadership is what is needed along with the right mechanism to take this city to heights beyond expectations.? ?
The beauty of Colombo is that it?s a multi-religious, multi-ethnic and multi-cultural city and we have always lived in harmony no matter what happens in the rest of the country
?Q? A recent report by a Presidential Commission revealed that the Meethotamulla tragedy was the result of the municipality failing to carry out proper garbage disposal methods. What are your comments??
That?s the past and it was beyond my control. I need to study the report and understand the drawbacks. We are looking at the way forward. This is why we had discussions about the waste-to-energy project, consultations with the Megapolis Minister and PM to address the waste issue. In the past, Meethotamulla was a disaster because in order to beautify Colombo, waste was taken and dumped in our neighbour?s garden amidst their protests. These things were done in a haphazard way since the demise of Ranasinghe Premadasa. I don?t think successive Governments had any plans regarding what to do with Colombo?s waste or waste at large around the country.
The present Government has identified Aruwakkalu as a permanent dumping place and they are now doing the groundwork. I?m looking at managing and handling Colombo city?s waste from the time I took over. But I would certainly study the report and see where we went wrong. Each ward member will have an App, so the residents of that ward can keep in touch with the member. Therefore ward members could educate their residents and get? them to be more responsible of keeping the city clean. Now that we have 47 wards in the six districts and having 47 ward members, putting in money to those wards to carryout the necessary infrastructure development I?m sure that we would be able to see a stronger and a better Colombo. This is ?Our Colombo? as written in my slogan and this city is our responsibility. I?m hoping that the residents would support. My appeal to every member of the Municipality is to support us in our work, irrespective of their parties. Let?s start putting the city first.?
In the past, the Governments had not realized how waste could be a money-spinner. There are many facets and uses of waste
?Q? A majority of citizens in Colombo are from underprivileged areas.?
You have said that the development of these areas will be prioritized. What is your plan??
My primary focus even with the 25 multi-purpose community centres is on the underserved areas because 1/3rd of the population lives in those areas. When I spoke about mixed garbage, when people don?t adhere to the norms, they all come from underserved areas. That?s not because they don?t understand or they are not disciplined; it is because they don?t have the provision. A normal house might have space to keep three different bins, but in a watte (A small area where people live), inside a tiny little room with five families I don?t think there?s room to put a bin. Therefore I have been telling the ward members to find a common place in the watte where the municipality can install a garbage disposal system.
We need to look at housing, sanitation and water for them. When I spoke about maternity clinics and dispensaries I was addressing the underserved development areas. When it comes to social welfare projects it would be 100% concentrated on these underserved development areas. I had a discussion with a foreign diplomat to establish three vocational training centres and daycare centres because I want to increase the female participation in the labour force. In order to do that I need to develop the infrastructure including affordable day care centres, safe transportation, flexible hours created and so on. We would also be having a daycare for the Municipality. When we improve the lifestyles of people in these areas then major projects such as sewer lines, waste water, drainage and mass scale housing projects will be in our long term development plans.? ?
Each ward member will have an App. Therefore ward members could educate their residents and get? them to be more responsible of keeping the city clean
?Q? Will future development activities of the city incorporate the ?wathu? system or would they be demolished?? ?
It all depends. We still have to consider the availability of land to see the possibility of building houses for them. We have already appointed a committee to empower women and look into their needs and bring in multi-serving and multi-purpose community centres. Most of my plans will be focused on developing underserved development areas.? ?
?Q? Many people travel to Colombo daily to engage in work. Those such as tourists visit Colombo for leisure. How would you plan to develop facilities in a way that would benefit those visiting the city?? ?
The residents are approximately 550,000 people whereas about 600,000 migrate on a daily basis. This is why we had a discussion with the Architects? Association from the Chairman to the secretary who met with the Engineering Department and our architects to find out how to safeguard the cultural heritage. They want to focus on parks and improving services for the migrant citizens coming in on a daily basis because we have some major schools in the country. These include everything from public toilets, resting places, opening up more areas to have recreation facilities for families around the Beira, the Fort area and so on. We are also considering the buildings that have a heritage value and plan to restore and maintain them and give Colombo a new outlook. They were very enthusiastic and this is the groundwork that we would be doing during next three months. We would be able to see some tangible results hopefully.? ?
Firstly it is about bringing in e-governance and instilling discipline in the Council. I?m also working on a mechanism to bring everyone to work
?Q? Many CMC workers are senior citizens who work day in and day out and receiving minimum wages. Are there plans to increase their salaries and incentives?? ?
That was one of the first questions I asked the department heads when I assumed duties. I want to read those contracts because we outsource many of these work. In those outsourcing contracts there are minimum age and salary scales. I have given all these contracts to my legal team to study them. I have advised the department heads to thoroughly review those contracts and to inform these people to be present at work, to adhere to what is written in the contract or step down. In future when we sign contracts we need to be specific about certain things such as salaries, age etc. This is why I need a HR department established.? ?
?Q? In a previous interview you mentioned about establishing rehabilitation centres for the youth. Along with these centres, how would the drug menace be mitigated in future?? ?
That is something that I have promised and would be doing within the next couple of months. I?m waiting for the Council to be formed in order to bring in resolutions to do many other things that are included in my manifesto. That?s a huge menace and it?s not an issue with just one strata of society, but it exists at every level. Much needs to be invested in terms of technical assistance and finances, but we would eventually make it a reality.? ?
?Q? During the previous Government most of the beautification projects were carried out under the purview of the Urban Development Authority (UDA). Why didn?t the CMC get involved?? ?
Some of the projects such as housing and infrastructure development with sewer waste etc would be done with the line ministries and the Central Government. The funding will also have to come from the Central Government. But the CMC can handle basic beautification projects. For example the Independence Square belongs to the UDA and we need to consider people who just park their vehicles and leave. I have instructed them to have an authorized parking space. When you have restrictions people can walk to their destination. I?ll also have to work with the Health Ministry and several other ministries in certain projects.? ??

Chairman, Vocational Training Authority Sri Lanka, Chandima Weerakkody ? Hon. Minister of Skills Development & Vocational Training, Dato Dr. Emmanuel Benson ? Chairman & CEO of Smart Trends International Lanka and Maheswaren Balakrishnan ? COO of Smart Trends International Lanka
Dato Dr. Emmanuel Benson, the Chairman & CEO of Smart Trends International Lanka said, ?It is a significant and memorable milestone for Smart Trends International Lanka to be given the honour to partner with the Vocational Training Authority of Sri Lanka in this strategic partnership. Our first initiative will be to develop and design a scaffolding training course (Level 1-4) incorporating innovative learning solutions, taking into account current local manpower expertise and needs and aligned to industry requirements.??
This will include a process, whereby Smart Trends International and NCFE will identify and train a master-trainer who will then conduct the train-the-trainers programme in Sri Lanka, with a con-current programme for independent assessors?.
?Furthermore, we are confident that these courses will allow Sri Lankans to up-skill and up-scale their vocational expertise, thereby allowing them to be highly employable not only within Sri Lanka but within the regional and global construction industry, where their expertise will be in much demand in the long run?, added Dr. Benson.
Besides NCFE, specific training programmes will also be endorsed and certified by the Industrial Training Institute of Kuala Lumpur, the oldest vocational training institute in Malaysia, founded in 1964.
Smart Trends International Lanka will build a dedicated custom-built Scaffolding Training facility and simulated training and test area with six purpose-built scaffolds.? Besides the above, training facilities with class room and management offices will also be opened concurrently.??
The Level-1 Scaffolding course will be spread over 10 days and offer insights into scaffolding; from duties and responsibilities to scaffolding materials used and types, practical theory and on-site training to safety issues and a 3-4-part assessment.
?We are confident, that by working in close partnership with the Vocational Training Authority of Sri Lanka, we will be able to offer a globally benchmarked qualification on scaffolding knowledge and practical skills that will prepare Sri Lankans who will be entering the building industry to erect scaffolding safely and according to specifications?, said Dato Dr Benson.
The VTA (Vocational Training Authority of Sri Lanka) was established with the intent of providing skills for employment by the Manpower Division, which is the training arm of the Labour Department that was running Technical and Vocational Education, as well as training programmes in many parts of Sri Lanka. This was converted to the newly constituted Vocational Training Authority making vocational training more accessible to rural youth and depressed segments of the country.
The VTA operates as the largest training center network of Vocational Training with 224 Vocational Training Centers, 22 District Vocational Training Centers and 7 National Vocational Training Institutes, from a mere 31 Vocational Training Centers in 1995. The VTA trains up to 35,000 youth annually in 83 trades in 18 trade sectors.?

Stormy Daniels? lawyer files motion to depose Trump
	
?
A lawyer for adult film star Stormy Daniels has requested in federal court to take a deposition from President Donald Trump in a legal battle over an agreement to keep her quiet about her allegation that they had a sexual relationship.
Her lawyer, Michael Avenatti, also asked to depose Trump?s lawyer Michael Cohen, whom Daniels is suing for defamation, a motion filed in United States District Court in the Central District of California showed on Wednesday.
Avenatti said in the motion that he would need no more than two hours to question each of the men.
Daniels originally sued Trump on March 6, saying he had never put his signature on a $130,000 agreement for her to stay silent in 2016, just before the presidential election, about what she called their ?intimate? relationship.
Trump has denied having an affair with Daniels.
On Monday, after Daniels discussed appeared in a widely-watched TV interview on ?60 Minutes? on CBS, Avenatti filed an amended lawsuit claiming that Cohen had defamed his client by suggesting she was a liar.

## Title: The story of a song, an uncle, and a niece

The story of a song, an uncle, and a niece
	
Ganga Addara, as those who?ve seen the film and the later, rather crassly made television remake would know, popularised Vijaya Kumaratunga through the titular song (performed, though never with the same intensity and sense of conviction, by other young vocalists). But there?s another tune, slotted in at the beginning of the film while the opening credits are rolling on. Sumitra Peries and the film?s producers, the Sumathipala family (Milina Sumathipala), had taken in Maurice Dahanayake?s son, Channa, and one of the Sumathipala daughters, Shalini, to act as the juvenile versions of the two protagonists and lovers in the story, played as adults by Vasanthi Chathurani and Sanath Gunathilake. The opening credits sequence really has no bearing on the larger narrative, but was used as a means of portraying the young innocence of the love that turns our heroine, Nirmala (Vasanthi) insane and in the end forces her to commit suicide.??
This opening tune was, as with Nimal Mendis? other works, written in English, and while it didn?t make sense, it was not intended to be an overtly serious song either. The chorus, Victor and Nirasha remember for me, ran on like this:??
Tralalalala you...??
Tralalalala me....??
Tralalalala sing together...??
Tralalalala we...??
As for the second verse:??
Swim like a fish...??
Fly like a bird...??
Be happy, little boy, little girl...??
No time to feel sad...??
My lass, my lad...??
Love is a wonderful thing....??
(Victor and Nirasha argue over the last line: the latter informs me that it was actually ?Love is a magical word...? In any case, it doesn?t really matter.)??
Nimal Mendis, as I mentioned before, wrote in English. To translate it into Sinhala, he got a Tamil gentleman from Panadura: Augustus Vinayagaratnam, who had already worked with Nimal for ?Ganga Addara? (the titular song) and, earlier, ?Upul Nuwan? (featured in Lester James Peries? Ahasin Polawata, which also featured Vijaya and Vasanthi and which also was produced by the Sumathipalas). In the end, Augustus, rising up to the occasion, met the primary challenge this entailed: keep to the spirit of the original while communicating it to the vernacular audience. If ?Tralalalala You? was meant to be so innocent, so jovial, that it was born (in one sense) to be sung as a carefree interlude, then Augustus delivered on the brief he was given. Nimal, obviously, was happy.??
On March 31, 1978, Nirasha and Victor went off to a studio near the Archbishop?s House in Borella. They had met about twice or thrice, before, at Mendis? residence, an annex off Jawatta Road. At the time Nirasha would have been 12, Victor about 30. ?Mind you, we hadn?t recorded a song like this before. Not even Uncle Victor!? Nirasha remembers, with a gleam in her eye.??
And to top it all, the song they were recording had to be recorded with some schoolchildren from Sangamitta Balika Vidyalaya in Borella. ?They would have all been primary schoolgirls, from Grade Four or Six. I was taken to one studio with Uncle Victor, and I put on an earphone. The other girls didn?t. What they sang, they had to sing with all the gusto they could bring out. It was really and truly a raw, unfiltered, unprofessional, and yes, innocent song. ?Cherubic? in the best sense of that word. In fact I don?t think it was meant to be recorded as a serious tune. None of us had voices which had been polished or refined. Nimal wanted that kind of tune, that kind of recording. But there was a problem. No matter how hard we tried, the girls couldn?t muster up the gusto he needed.???
At the studio there had been Mendis as the composer, Augustus as the lyricist, and Sarath Fernando as the orchestrator. All three of them tried to uplift the girls? spirits, to no avail. ?I remember Uncle Sarath making faces at them, trying to keep them amused. We obviously needed to make them feel the song they sang. So Nimal hit on a solution. He asked me to sing the first line of the first verse, and when it was sung again by the girls, to take a step back from the microphone and sing it with the rest of the girls. That way my voice would blend in with theirs and at the same time I wouldn?t stand out from them. I remember him telling Uncle Victor also to step away from the mike. It was a risk we all had to take. And at the end of the day, it was a risk that paid off. Handsomely.???
If took all of five or six takes for Nimal Mendis to get what he wanted, and the end result was to his liking. It was, as Nirasha so aptly puts it to me, a very unprofessional song, one that ran along and flowed along succinctly to the tenor of a group of children who probably weren?t aware of what they were doing. Incidentally Augustus?s lyrics reflected this, so well that they retain the rawness of Nimal?s composition. As for the song, well, here are some of the lyrics:??
The name of the tune? ?Ran Tikiri Sina.???
The story of ?Ran Tikiri Sina? doesn?t end here though. The afterword it compels can be, in Nirasha?s and Victor?s own words, be summed up as follows: despite the producers and the composer, it was sadly and ultimately hijacked and, if I may use that term, appropriated by more established players who, ironically, missed out on one quality of the tune that the two original vocalists had not: the sense of innocence that no polished voice could convey or do justice to. ?In hindsight I think it was erroneous on the part of these vocalists to choose ?Ran Tikiri Sina.? Not because we sang it originally, but because it wasn?t meant to be sung in a professional, suave way. It needed to retain a welter of joviality. That?s what Nimal Mendis got with the original recording, that?s what was never replicated elsewhere. Moreover, we had a saving grace in the form of the children who performed it with us. We had one reply to give audiences: ?If the recording you hear doesn?t have a children?s ensemble, then it isn?t ours!????
There was another saving grace. Hudson Samarasinghe, then at the Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation (SLBC), got hold of the story behind ?Ran Tikiri Sina?
There was another saving grace. Hudson Samarasinghe, then at the Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation (SLBC), got hold of the story behind ?Ran Tikiri Sina?. He thought for some days, paid a visit to the Sumathipalas, procured an original spool of the tune, returned to the SLBC, and got it recorded there. ?As long as I?m in this division, I won?t let another version of this song be broadcast,? he is reported to have told Victor, who recounts this to me this rather happily. ?Hudson saved us. We would have wasted away, particularly since we gave up our musical careers afterwards, if not for him.? More was to come, happily.??
20 years after Ganga Addara was released, that is in 1999, the Sumathipalas held a felicitation ceremony involving everyone who had been a part of the film, from Sumitra Peries to Tissa Abeysekara (the scriptwriter) to Donald Karunaratne (the cameraman) to of course Nirasha and Victor. When the awards were duly handed over, to the two of them, and the acknowledgement read out in public, the journalists and media men and women present at the occasion were rather astonished. ?For over a decade they had associated ?Ran Tikiri Sina? with another set of vocalists. They were astounded to realise that we were the original performers. Not long afterwards, we got requests for interviews, and we were thenceforth featured in several newspapers which carried such telling headlines as ?Ran Tikiri Sina smiles again.? To top it all, Chandimal Fernando, who too had performed the tune, though not for commercial purposes, called the two of them to sing it with him onstage: ?The first time we sang it onstage, to be honest.???
I met Victor Silva and Nirasha Perera at their residence in Rosmead Place the other day and I was happy, relieved almost, that 40 years have passed. 40 years, that is, since the recording of the song this article is about, specifically 40 years to March 31. A lot has happened. Some of it needn?t be recounted, others have been recounted. By me and by everyone else. In the meantime, all we can say, looking at these two gentle people and perusing the lyrics of the tune they hummed, is what someone once said of music in general: ?It gives a soul to the universe, wings to the mind, flight to the imagination, and life to everything.???
I first heard ?Ran Tikiri Sina? on air from the lips of other established singers. Watching Ganga Addara made me realise that such songs are appropriated by those who piggy bank on the successes they encounter, whether at the hands of critics or of popular audiences. Victor and Nirasha have much to be happy about in that respect, I think. For now and forever. So thank you. For now and forever.

UNP ready for drastic changes in Govt - Rajitha
	
If the SLFP Ministers of the Yahapalana Government propose to the other coalition partner UNP to effect drastic changes in the Government including the replacement of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, before April 4, the UNP was ready to consider them positively, Cabinet Spokesman Dr Rajitha Senaratne said.
In response to a question raised by the Daily Mirror at the weekly cabinet news briefing yesterday on the remarks made by Minister S.B. Dissanayake on Wednesday to the media that the No-Confidence Motion was not against President Maithripala Sirisena or the Government but to remove Prime Minister Wickremesinghe from his post, Minister Senaratne said they must not discuss those issues first with the media but with the UNP.
He added a dialogue between the SLFP and the UNP Ministers was possible before April 4- the day the No-Confidence Motion is taken up for debate in Parliament.
?If we could settle the issue in this way before April 4, I think it is the most appropriate way to resolve this issue, Minister Senaratne stressed.
The dialogue between journalists and Ministers Senaratne and Gayantha Karunatilaka as follows.
Journalist: Your name has been mentioned as the new Prime Minister. Are you ready?
Minister Senaratne: Smiling, no no. There is time for me to take up that position.
Daily Mirror: The main issue is that they all want to remove Mr Wickremesinghe from the Premiership. How are you going to face this?
Minister Senaratne: The UNP Working Committee is to meet tomorrow (29) at 4.00 p.m. at the Temple Trees to determine how to face the No-Confidence Motion.
Daily Mirror: Minister Dissanayake says that the No-Confidence Motion is only against Prime Minister and not against the Government or the President as they could not oppose most of the allegations against Mr Wickremesinghe.
Minister Senaratne: They must not tell these things to media.
Daily Mirror: Are you ready to discuss the contents of the No-Confidence Motion including the removal of the Prime Minister before April 4?
Minister Senaratne: Yes indeed. We are ready and steady in the journey forward of the Yahapalana Government as a coalition.
Daily Mirror: Did the UNP Parliamentary Group make a request yesterday to Mr Wickremesinghe to step down at a Sirikotha meeting?
Minister Senaratne: No.
Daily Mirror: What happened to the proposals made by Minister Champika
Ranawaka?
Minister Senaratne: They are being reviewed.
Daily Mirror: But, we cannot see any progress but only delaying tactics.
Minister Karunatilaka: There will be drastic changes in the party before long based on the proposals made by the three committees appointed by Mr Prime Minister and proposals made by Minister Ranawaka.
Daily Mirror: Including the removal of Prime Minister?
Minister Karunatilaka: Including changes in the party leadership.
Daily Mirror: State Minister Range Bandara says that 23 UNP members were going to vote for the motion and don?t you think the situation for the UNP is precarious?
Minister Karunatilaka: Yes, if 23 UNP members vote in support of the motion. But that is their assessment.
A Journalist: What if the UNP could not defeat the No-Confidence Motion?
Minister Karunatilaka: We will have to form a one-party government and we are ready for that.
Journalist: Most of the allegations in the motion involve Central Bank bond scam.
Minister Senaratne: I opposed it from the very beginning for the appointment of Arjuna Mahendran as the CB Governor.
Journalist: It is the responsibility of Prime Minister Wickremesinghe to bring him back as Mahendran is evading courts and no one knows whereabouts of him.
Minister Senaratne: Please look at those issues rationally. Tell me whether you must take the responsibility if your friend does an illegal thing.
Journalist: But Mr Mahendran was handpicked by Prime Minister and when he left for Singapore during the CoI inquiry proceedings, Mr Wickremesinghe vouched that he would come back. Two suspects wanted in Sri Lanka, Udayanga Weeratunga and Mahendran are evading arrest.
Journalist: When the Mr Mahendran will be arrested and bring back to Sri Lanka?
Minister Senaratne: Don?t treat both on the same line. Even the commission report says that Mahendran was the best CB Governor chosen for the post for the last 10 years. Besides, if there is any financial loss to the Government from the bond scam there is enough money to settle them in the suspended accounts of the Perpetual Treasuries Ltd.
Journalist: Don?t you think Mr Wickremesinghe has a responsibility to bring him back?
Minister Senaratne: Not at all. Prime Minister disowned him after he realized the damage caused to the government from the bond scam. (Sandun A Jayasekera)

Vehicle Importers: Can?t meet Euro IV standards by July 1
	
Ceylon Motor Traders? Association (CMTA) yesterday claimed that they required more time for transition on Government?s decision to change to importing vehicles compatible with the Euro four standards from July 1.
Speaking to the Daily Mirror exclusively CMTA Chairman Reeza Rauf said the Government had decided to ban the import of vehicles, which did not comply with Euro 4 standards with airbags and seat belts and below the emission levels or its equivalent.
?We do not oppose the decision taken by the Government, but before implementing these kinds of policies, the Government should discuss with the stakeholders as we need time to prepare ourselves,? he said.
?As stakeholders, we need at least a period of one year to prepare for the transition. There is no proper regulation to state the compatibility of the Euro standards in the country,? he said.
?We are the people who have direct contacts with vehicle manufacturers and they should have been informed with our immediate transition,? he said.
?Therefore, the Government needs to be specific in what it is going to introduce Euro four vehicles for,? Mr Rauf said.
?We have requested the Finance Ministry to specify the vehicle category which falls under the Euro IV standards.
?No certificate has been issued by the Government to certify the vehicle fuel compatibility for Euro four standards. The Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CEYPETCO) said that it likes to shift to Euro IV standards but no certificate had been issued to show the vehicle manufacturers that we are changing the emission standards,? he said.
?We are importing Euro 2 or Euro 3 compatible vehicles with certain other safety features, that are already incorporated, but there are different types of vehicles, which have and which didn't have the mentioned safety features,? (Chaturanga Samarawickrama)

China says Kim pledges denuclearization during friendly visit
	
?
North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has pledged to denuclearize and meet U.S. officials, China said on Wednesday after an historic meeting with President Xi Jinping, who promised China would uphold friendship with its isolated neighbor.
After two days of speculation, China and North Korea both confirmed that Kim had travelled to Beijing and met Xi during what China called an unofficial visit from Sunday to Wednesday.?
The visit was Kim?s first known trip outside North Korea since he assumed power in 2011 and is believed by analysts to serve as preparation for upcoming summits with South Korea and the United States. North Korea?s KCNA news agency made no mention of Kim?s pledge to denuclearize, or his anticipated meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump that is planned for some time in May.
China has traditionally been secretive North Korea?s closest ally but ties have been frayed by its pursuit of nuclear weapons and China?s backing of tough U.N. sanctions in response.

Does Sri Lanka have courage to nab human traffickers?
	
Startling revelations are now coming to light as to how Sri Lankans too are getting actively involved in human trafficking. But there is a failure on the part of the authorities concerned in taking adequate action against these law breakers which has raised eyebrows in the society.? ?
Although the Criminal Investigations Department (CID), Sri Lanka Foreign Employment Bureau and the Department of Immigration and Emigration are closely keeping a check on suspected traffickers and taking legal action against the criminals, the Consular Affairs Division of Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Colombo and the Maradana Police have come under severe criticism for not taking any action to arrest a trafficker who had recently trafficked two marine engineering students to Malaysia.? ?
CAST opened the first shelter in 2004
	Matul was made to work over?18 hours per day
It has come to light as to how the US Government and non-governmental organizations are working hand in glove towards combating human trafficking
	The Malaysian Police had rescued two Sri Lankan youths recently from forced labour and had arrested the Malaysian agent
	Sri Lankan agency isn?t registered either with the SL Foreign Employment Bureau or with Ceylon Shipping Lines
	Upon seeing an advertisement in a national paper, Madusanka Perera Edirisinghe and Dushan Kavinda De Silva had applied for jobs related to maritime engineering
The officials of the Consular Affairs Division of Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Colombo and the Maradana Police when asked as to why they have so far failed to arrest the criminal and produce the individual in court on charges of trafficking told the DailyMirror that since the two 21-year-old victims have willingly signed the contract with the local agent, action cannot be taken under the laws of trafficking regarding this person.? ?
?They have signed the contract and had gone to Malaysia. This cannot be considered as trafficking,? officials said.? ?
When told that the two boys had been duped by the agent promising a job in a vessel and not to mine sand in a boat- which falls under forced labour- neither the police nor the Consular Affairs Division was ready to accept that forced labour too is part and parcel of human trafficking.? ?
Our Embassy staff have been notified that the two boys can?t be sent as an investigation is now in progress
-Director Consular Affairs Division
This is contrary to how the law enforcement authorities in the United States of America are handling human trafficking issues. During a recent visit to the US, it came to light as to how the US government and non-governmental organizations are working hand in glove towards combating human trafficking. They further stretch their helping hands to rehabilitate the victims through legal, social and advocacy services.? ?
Following ?s expose last week which appeared under the headline ?US Closes in on Sex Slave Operators and Human Traffickers?, it came to light how a Sri Lankan job agent in Darley Road, Colombo is involved in human trafficking, but is operating freely thanks to some officials in Sri Lanka Police and Ministry of Foreign Affairs.? ?
The Malaysian Police had rescued two Sri Lankan youths recently from forced labour and had arrested the Malaysian agent, an Indian Tamil, who was involved in a series of human trafficking cases. Although the Malaysian Police was quick enough to arrest the agent in Malaysia, it is surprising to note how the local agent- Vernon- who sent the two victims for forced labour is still at large despite a compliant being lodged at the Maradana Police, by the victims? parents.? ?
Instead of safeguarding the interests of those who have been trafficked for the purpose of forced labour and slavery-like practices a few officials of these two Government institutions are alleged to have not taken action against the perpetrator during the past several days.? ?
Victims? parents shouted at? ?
Several attempts were made to contact OIC Crimes Maradana, who is alleged to have shouted at the parents when the latter party went to lodge a complaint against the fraudster agent. However these attempts to contact the OIC Crimes were futile. The parents had later got their statement recorded in the police following their inquiries to learn what action the police had taken against Vernon. Although this newspaper requested for a personal contact number to reach the OIC Crimes, officials of the Maradana Police did not provide any contact details of the OIC.? ?
However, the OIC Maradana said that he would look into what has happened and give this paper a feedback. All attempts thereafter to contact the OIC Maradana too failed.? ?
Meanwhile Director Consular Affairs Division of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs told the?Daily Mirror?that unless the complaint lodged against the Malaysian agent is withdrawn, there would be a delay in getting back the two students.? ?
?Our Embassy staff in Malaysia have spoken to the Police. They have been notified that the two boys can?t be sent as an investigation is now in progress. The only way to get the two victims back, is to withdraw the complaint against the Malaysian agent,? the Director said.? ?
When asked as to why the Foreign Ministry can?t have discussions at Government level and get back the victims without making requests to withdraw the complaint, Director Consular Affairs said that there is no other way to get the children back if the complaint isn?t withdrawn.
He further said that it was revealed that the agency in Sri Lankan is not registered either with the Sri Lanka Foreign Employment Bureau or with Ceylon Shipping Lines and the only institution that could take action against the agency is the Foreign Employment Bureau and not the Consular Affairs Division.? ?
Meanwhile, Prashantha, the father of Dushan Kavinda, said that the two boys had received a call from one of the Sri Lankan female employees attached to the Sri Lankan High Commission in Malaysia who has accused the boys of lodging a complaint against the Malaysian agent. ?I know the name of this officer and will reveal the details at a future inquiry.
What made her accuse our children of lodging the complaint without taking action instead to get the boys released? Evan one Ms. Malkanthai from the Consular Affairs Division called me on Monday after the? made inquiries as to why they are slow in taking action to get the children. This person wanted me to ask my son to withdraw the complaint. Why are they so concerned about the complaint? Our foreign mission has to safeguard our interests, but not the Malaysians. We believe this is a racket and even officials in our foreign mission too are involved in this,? Prashantha alleged.? ?
The traffickers took our passports to confine us to the place where we worked

Newspaper advertisement? ?
Upon seeing an advertisement in a national paper, Madusanka Perera Edirisinghe and Dushan Kavinda De Silva, two students studying at the Colombo International Nautical and Engineering Campus (CINEC) and following a Navigation Watch Keeping Simulator Course, had applied for jobs related to maritime engineering with the view of obtaining experience. Both students had to pay Vernon, Rs.325, 000 each as the agent fee. This agent had claimed that he had to send part of the money to the agent in Malaysia.?
Although they have been promised jobs in a large vessel, they have been forced to mine sand in Malaysia.? ?
According to Prashantha, when the two boys arrived in Kuala Lumpur International Airport in Malaysia, the Malaysian agent - Mr. Ravi from India- had met them and forced them to surrender their passports before taking them to Sibu Island on a speed boat.? ?
?At Sibu, our children had been forced to mine sand, an order which they had refused carry out. Later after several days of agitation, they had been able to escape from the traffickers and had lodged a complaint with the police. The police had immediately arrested the Indian national under the Act of Anti-Trafficking in Persons although our own police and the Consular Affairs Division of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs failed to take any action against the local agent,? Prashantha said.? ?
According to Prashantha, when the parents of the victims went to the Maradana police Station soon after they were informed that their children had been trafficked, OIC Crimes had not wanted to record the statement. ?When we told him what had happened to our children, the OIC asked one of his officers in the MO branch to record the statement which was unheeded. The complaint was recorded the following day, but no action has been taken to date,? Prashantha said.? ?
According to him, the two boys are now held by the Malaysian Police for further investigation and the officers there had inquired as to whether the Sri Lankan police had arrested the local agent?? ?
The parents further alleged as to how the Consular Affairs Division of Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not take any action against Vernon, despite a complaint being lodged.? ?
?When Vernon was asked to appear at the Consular Affairs Division, he wasn?t present at the inquiry. They are yet to take action against the agent,? Prashantha said.??
What made her accuse our children of lodging the complaint without taking action instead to get the boys released?

CAST? ?
Although the situation in Sri Lanka remains thus, Coalition to Abolish Slavery and Trafficking (CAST) which is an anti-human trafficking organization based in Los Angeles CA, helps to rehabilitate victims of human trafficking through legal, social and advocacy services.? ?
According to CAST, its officials have spearheaded many development efforts in the anti-trafficking movement. It opened the first shelter for human trafficking victims in 2004 and was instrumental in starting the Los Angeles Slavery and Trafficking Task Force which is now called as Los Angeles Metropolitan Task Force on Human Trafficking.? ?
At CAST, the Daily Mirror met Irma Matul who was a victim of forced labour. After several years in captivity she was able to contact CAST with the help of her neighbour. ?CAST helps out the victims of trafficking to overcome their traumatic past. We were taken for counseling and were provided with housing facilities, leadership training and mentorship. CAST is the leading voice in shaping policy and public awareness to prevent modern slavery and human trafficking. The organization supports and encourages survivors to realize their own leadership qualities and to value their insight not just as survivors, but as experts in the human trafficking field. Their work has not only changed the lives of those impacted by human trafficking, but has come up as an organization to put an end to human trafficking and modern slavery,? she claimed.? ?

?
Matul?s story? ?
Matul further stated as to how she was brought to US at the age of 17 to look after a baby. ?I worked for a family in Indonesia and the employer once asked whether I would like to go to Los Angeles to work as a Nanny and serve a family known to them. I was overjoyed as I was promised a better package and came to US on a labour visa. Upon my arrival at LA, I had to handover my passport to my new employer who I did not know was a trafficker. I was trafficked with a cousin of mine and do not know her whereabouts nor whether she too was subjected to abuse. The trafficker in US is also from Indonesia and her husband is a Chinese and they both have US citizenship,? Matul said.? ?
According to her the salary she was promised as a nanny had not been paid by the trafficker nor had the employer granted her leave even when she was sick.? ?
?Although I was promised a good salary, I was paid a minimal amount. I wasn?t provide with even a mat to sleep on. During the winter season, I slept on the floor in a corner of the hall without a blanket. I was continuously abused physically and verbally. Although I decided to run away on many occasions, I could not do so as I couldn?t speak in English,? she added.? ?
According to her, she was given leftover milk provided for the child. She added as to how she had to work over 18 hours per day without taking a break.? ?
?I had to get up at 6 in the morning and work till past 2 am the following day. During the four hours that I got to seep, I still had to get up if the baby awoke. When I came to the US, I believed that everything was normal. I suffered immensely for three years and never knew that I was in slavery. I was beaten up on many occasions, but the employer never took me to a doctor to put medicine for the bruises. I was told not to talk to any outsider as they were in fear that I would reveal how they were treating me. When I could not bear the pain and the anguish anymore, I took the ladder climbed up the wall and went to the neighbour?s house seeking help. It was they who brought me to CAST. Since there were no proper laws in US in 2000, my trafficker was not prosecuted. Now we educate doctors and nurses on how to identify traffickers. The fear we underwent can?t be described to anyone in words. I don?t want any other human being to undergo the suffering what I personally experienced,? she said.? ?
Matul is now happy with her involvement in the CAST leadership programme which she joined in 2012. She added that there are 200 members with her involved in the leadership programme; people who have been trafficked to the US from 24 different countries.? ?
Meanwhile Avellino Reloj is a Phillipino who too had been trafficked to the US in 2007. In Philippines he had worked as a housekeeper and was in debt back in his home country.??
?As I could not settle the debt in my country, I decided to go overseas for a better salary. It was at that time that I came to know about and agent who was sending people to US for a higher salary. When I met the agent I was offered a janitor?s job and signed a contract. We were promised free food, lodging and medical care,? Reloj said.? ?
I was trafficked with a cousin of mine and don?t know whether she too was subjected to abuse
-Matul
According to Reloj when he came to the USA, he was asked to enter into another employment agreement to which he had felt suspicious. Reljo too had to surrender his passport after arriving USA. ?The traffickers took our passports to confine us to the place where we worked knowing that we cannot run away without any travel document,? Reloj said.? ?
?Instead of getting free food, lodging and medical care as promised, we had to pay for all these and even for the travelling. Instead of a house, we were given a bunker. I had to bear all this as my debt swelled in Philippines by 2009. This was because the salary that was promised was not paid to us. We were promised US $ 1,500 per month, but we were paid only US$ 500. Once I decided to run away from the clutches of the traffickers and went in search of CAST. During the past five years I have been working at Beverley Hills and get remunerated well.? ?

## Title: Empowering Women New building for MLSC vocational training centre in Kahatowita
## Section: News Features

Empowering Women New building for MLSC vocational training centre in Kahatowita
	
In 1970, a watershed movement to help the underprivileged was led by five vibrant young ladies in Galle. Almost 48 years later, these gentlewomen of the Muslim Ladies Study Circle (MLSC) have left a legacy of service.?
Engaged in community service for several decades, the MLSC is responsible for the establishment of a vocational centre at Kahatowita in Attanagalle, serving the community over the past 10 years. The women and children in Kahatowita were duly benefitted under the patronage of the MLSC. As the numbers grew, the need for a more spacious building was communicated to the ladies at the wheel.?
Business tycoon and well-known philanthropist, Alhaj Ellyas Careem responded positively to this need as he believed charity should be done in a constructive manner. When Careem attended an awards ceremony at the MLSC-sponsored vocational training centre in Galle, he came across numerous successful and independent women who had acquired their tertiary skills from the vocational training centre in Galle. Careem was a strong believer that charity should make the recipient self-supportive and not be made dependent through charity. It is with this belief that he extended support towards the establishment of a new and improved vocational training centre in Kahatowita, a densely populated village.?
With a Rs.40 million donation from Careem, a three-storey building was erected for the new vocational training centre. Speaking at the humble opening ceremony, MLSC President Mrs. Ameena Faisz Musthapha said empowering women of the rural hamlets was one of the circle?s key objectives. ?Our vision is to give women skills so they could gain not only economic independence but also the confidence they need to secure their place in society,? she said. ?10 years ago, we commenced our first MLSC vocational training centre in Kahatowita in rented premises. We had no regret in investing our efforts at this centre as we found the teachers and the committee were very diligent?and hardworking.??
?The teachers who conduct these classes have been trained at our headquarters in Colombo. They will be conducting classes in cookery, dressmaking, embroidery, cake icing, machine embroidery, computer studies, English and Thajweed. The MLSC Colombo has come forward to provide this centre with all necessary furniture and equipment for these courses,? a committee member of the MLSC said.?
A close-knit community with a majority of Muslims forms the Kahatowita village. However, it is observed that they live in harmony and help each and every family of the village when in need. Their unity was illustrated when several underprivileged Sinhalese families were granted electricity connections through the efforts of the MLSC and the Kahatowita community.?
In addition to vocational training, the community has also come together to engage in various community outreach programmes such as tutoring students for the scholarship examination and free medical clinics. The new building will be instrumental in reaching out to women in surrounding areas such as Udugoda, Thihariya, Pasyala, Attanagalla, Pugoda, Kal-eliya, Algama and Orchadwatte.?
The Kahatowita vocational training centre educates some 150 ladies at present. The young and the old are enrolled in various programmes ranging from cookery to embroidery and craftwork designed to help them embark on self-employment ventures. The objective is to empower young girls and women to be self-sufficient and also to support their families.?
15-year-old Faliha Falrik, who is enrolled in a computer studies programme, hopes to complete her course while attending school. ?Through the vocational training course, I can support myself when I need to in the future,? she said eagerly.?
Juraisa Jamaldeen, a young lady of 24 years, is a student at the Colombo? University?s School? of Computing. However, she has enrolled for courses in cookery and dressmaking at the Kahatowita training centre. ?I?m excited to start learning new skills. I love to learn and this organisation has provided us with many inspiring examples. This programme motivates women to seek employment and encourages housewives to be economically independent,? said ambitious Juraisa who hopes to be a software engineer and inspire young girls of her community one day.?
Munawar Alhaj Fayaz, a senior Kahatowita committee member said the village had endured numerous difficulties in the past. He noted however, through the amity, dedication and perseverance of the villagers, they have been able to overcome many hardships and become an exemplary village. ?The new vocational training centre premises will empower not only the ladies of our community but our community as a whole,? he opined.?
Vocational training centres sponsored by the MLSC have been established in Colombo, Galle, Panadura and Weligama. These centres have thus far produced approximately 7,500 qualified and capable women. The new vocational training centre building in Kahatowita not only empowers women but also ensures the continuity of education and quality vocational training for many deserving women in society.? ?

Addressing the recent ceremony to bless Ven. Dr. Pelpola Vipassi Thera of the Pelpola Vipassi Foundation, PC Member Jayantha de Silva said everyone in the Sakya Clan was not destined to attain Buddhahood.? ?
One could not go beyond one?s limitations of what could be done in one?s capacity and that everyone should be able to distinguish between right and wrong. He pointed out that many individuals who ventured to undertake tasks beyond their capacity ended up in failure and created serious issues affecting the people
?We have a private life and a social life and matters pertaining to both are equally important. However one must have a thorough understanding of his duties and responsibilities pertaining to one?s private life and social life.
We should know our limitations when undertaking any task.?
Judging from the activities of politicians and social workers we could see that they are not wise enough, or else they could do a better service to their fellow men.?
It is the duty of teachers and parents to lead children along the right path and inculcate proper social values in them, to improve their ability to distinguish between right and wrong.?
However, at present, children have to undertake tasks beyond their capacity under compulsion of their parents who expect their children to be doctors or engineers without assessing their inborn talents or allowing them to pursue their ambitions.?
Many children pushed towards the targets of their parents end up as failures.?
We have a private life and a social life and matters pertaining to both are equally important. However one must have a thorough understanding of his duties and responsibilities pertaining to one?s private life and social life. We should know our limitations when undertaking any task
Great men started their ambitious careers early in life and rendered a yeoman service to mankind through ventures that were within their capacity.
Many others who attempted to bite more than they could chew got into trouble and created problems for the people.?
Politicians who do not have an understanding of their limitations and build castles in the air, often fall to the ground.? ? ?

??Glyphosate linked to kidney disease?? -Prof. Channa Jayasumana
	
Prof. Channa Jayasumana, a leading academic who has done extensive research into the kidney disease in Rajarata, speaks about Glyphosate and its impact on the spread of the disease. Also, he compares the disease pattern in Sri Lanka and India. Excerpts of the interview:?
Describes?how international scientist research corroborates?his finding??
	Throws light on disease pattern in India and?Sri Lanka
?Q? How do you view the move to ban the use of weedicide called ?Glyphosate??
It is an unwise proposal. The ban on Glyphosate should not be lifted due to any reason.??
?Q? How do you support your argument that this particular agro-chemical was responsible for kidney disorders?
I have to emphasise Glyphosate is linked to disease but it is not the sole cause. For the first time in 2013, we produce epidemiological evidences to show glyphosate?
is associated with chronic kidney disease in agricultural communities. Our finding shows farmers who used glyphosate and paraquat (another weedicide which was banned in 2010) are prone to the disease five times more than those who are exposed to it. Then we found groundwater and food items contaminated with Glyphosate?
and residues. Thirdly, we detected glyphosate residues in these patients? biological samples. Very recently, we found specific lesion in biopsy samples of these particular kidney patients.?
Glyphosate has been identified as one of the chemical, which produces such a lesion. In addition a recently published human study from China shows glyphosate causing renal damage. Chinese scientists selected 526 workers who were occupationally exposed to glyphosate from 5 glyphosate-producing factories as cases; and another 442 administrative staffs who were not exposed to glyphosate were selected as controls. The overall rates of abnormal renal function in the case group were 16.2% while it was 4.8% in controls. This is a very strong study to support our argument. In another study done by UK and France scientists, it has been shown that glyphosate based herbicide produces renal lesion in rats, which are similar to the lesions in Sri Lankan kidney patients when exposed through drinking water. So what else you need to say this chemical is linked to disease???
I have to emphasise Glyphosate is linked to disease but it is not the sole cause. In 2013, we produce epidemiological evidences to show glyphosate is associated with chronic kidney disease in agricultural communities
?Q? There is an argument that glyphosate ban is a reason for government?s poor performance in the recent local election. What is your opinion?
It is nonsense and a very poor argument. There are hundreds of reasons for governments? defeat. It is nothing to do with glyphosate. If this is the reason, why was the government defeated in Maharagama (Colombo suburb)? Are voters of Maharagama using Glyphosate???
?Q? You recently had an academic involvement in India. How do you see the disease pattern there?
This is very interesting. For the last 10-15 years, we compared the disease in the Central American region and Sri Lanka. There were some recent reports from India saying that the similar disease is spread across four Indian states - Andra Pradesh, Telungana, Odisha and Gujarat. This was found among sugar-cane and rice farmers and vegetable growers. I visited the affected areas there and had a conference in Chandigarh in Panjab. It was at the 37th annual conference of Indian society of toxicology. I had the opportunity to meet different doctors and investigators working in different fields of medicine, particularly the toxicologists.
They are of the opinion that this disease is basically due to certain toxins. I exchanged ideas with those doctors and investigators. The clinical picture is similar with patients of north central province of Sri Lanka. I did a few field visits. The remarkable thing is that the environment, soil and climate are similar to the disease endemic region in Sri Lanka, similar to which were found in Andra Pradesh, Telangana and Odisha. The unofficial report said the death toll in India is very high. It may be exceeding the death toll in Sri Lanka.? ?
One thing is that. The health system is well developed in Sri Lanka compared to India. Any death due to kidney disease is reported to the health system in our setup. In India, this system does not exist. In the rural areas, this chronic disease is under-reported. I believe the disease might have begun to spread in India in 1990s. Yet, it was not reported till the last couple of years.
?Q? Is it due to high population in India?
One thing is that. The health system is well developed in Sri Lanka compared to India. Any death due to kidney disease is reported to the health system in our setup. In India, this system does not exist. In the rural areas, this chronic disease is under-reported. I believe the disease might have begun to spread in India in 1990s. Yet, it was not reported till the last couple of years.? ?
?Q? How do you speak about the aetiology of this disease?
It is found in the river basins in India, where the rivers are very long. So the washout is also high. So, concentration of toxic agents downstream is very high compared with our rivers. The disease is found downstream in India close to the coastal areas in river basins.? ?
Different studies show that the toxic concentration in muddy soils is very high. People in such areas are heavily affected. Their hypothesis is that this is caused by toxins. They need more research to confirm. Their studies are not on par with our studies. We have studied it for the last two decades. They have just started it. I feel this is the same disease that is found in India.??
The remarkable thing is that the environment, soil and climate are similar to the disease endemic region in Sri Lanka, similar to which were found in Andra Pradesh, Telangana and Odisha. The unofficial report said the death toll in India is very high. It may be exceeding the death toll in Sri Lanka
?Q? What are the kinds of scholarly exchanges you are planning to make?
I was able to interact with those attached to high medical research institutions in Gujarat, Telangana and Andra. They expressed their willingness to collaborate with us and get our expert views. Research-wise, we are well ahead of them.? ?
The former President of the Indian Institute of Pharmacology invited for an official collaboration between Rajarata University and their institution in Hyderabad. We have to establish whether it is the identical disease in India. According to available evidence, it is the same disease. However, we have to establish it in a credible manner. India has some improved laboratory and medical facilities in certain aspects. Collaborative studies will lead to minimize the spread of this disease and fight it in a common field.? ?
?Q? Is there any collaboration for the development of traditional medicine to treat the patients?
?India is a country which is abundant with Ayurvedic and complimentary medicine. They have different methods to treat kidney patients and issues associated with the urinary tracts. I think we can get their expertise in this regard. However this should be done with great care, as there are many pseudo healers.??
At a recent international symposium here, we discussed how Sinhala indigenous physicians and western medical practitioners treat patients suffering from chronic kidney diseases. Research findings show that certain indigenous practices can improve renal functions of these patients. In the western system, we can only control the disease.? ?
In Sri Lanka, we have very good indigenous medicinal practices. India also has a very good Ayurvedic practice. Close cooperation could bring in favourable results. Both could feed with each other in this respect. The western medicine has almost failed in the treatment of this chronic kidney disease
?Q? Have you identified any Sinhala indigenous physicians in Rajararata?
Yes, we presented a paper at a recent international conference on traditional medicine systems. An indigenous physician was there in the same panel. We presented some data. Actually, 56% of the patients who have been treated by this physicians have shown significant improvement in their blood and urine parameters.? ?
In Sri Lanka, we have very good indigenous medicinal practices. India also has a very good Ayurvedic practice. Close cooperation could bring in favourable results. Both could feed with each other in this respect.?
The western medicine has almost failed in the treatment of this chronic kidney disease. Though I am a professor in western medicine, I have to accept the truth.? ?

Hassan Esufally on a mission to be the first Sri Lankan be a part of The 7 Continents Marathon Club
	
Hassan Esufally with Hon. Dayasiri Jayasekera ? Minister of Sports
Hassan Esufally aims to become the first Sri Lankan in history to complete one of the world?s most gruelling marathon feats ? running a full marathon in all seven continents of the world. Achieving this feat will propel him into a unique and exclusive club of the world?s greatest marathon runners ? the 7 Continents Marathon Club?.
Achieving this goal would mean that Esufally needs to compete in and complete some of the most challenging marathons in the world.
"My goal is to become the first Sri Lankan to complete a full marathon in each of the seven continents by running in the world?s hardest and most exclusive marathons,? Esufally says. ?My aim is to bring pride to Sri Lanka, to popularize adventure marathons, and hopefully to inspire others to also attempt these formidable goals. We may be a small island nation, but we have immense potential for sports and adventure and we need to keep pushing ourselves to achieve bigger and greater sporting goals.?
Hassan Esufally is no stranger to difficult challenges, having successfully completed the IRONMAN? 140.6 Asia Pacific Championship in Cairns, Australia in 2016. This event includes a 3.86km swim, a 180km bike ride and a 42.2km full marathon run.

Completing the 2016 IRONMAN?, and running past the finishing line draped in the Sri Lankan flag, inspired Esufally to keep pushing the boundaries and he set his sights on becoming the first Sri Lankan to gain membership of the exclusive the 7 Continents Marathon Club?.
A full marathon is usually 42.2 km (26 miles and 385 yards being the historical measure) but each continent presents its own unique challenges and extreme conditions. Esufally has already completed marathons in the continents of Europe (Stockholm Marathon in June 2017), Asia (Colombo Marathon in October 2017) and Australia (Melbourne Marathon in 2014 and 2016) and this year he plans to complete the daunting task of completing marathons in the other four continents of the world.
In April he will compete in the Boston Marathon in USA, the world?s oldest marathon event and one of the most prestigious races in the world. In June, Esufally will compete on the African continent, running in the Big Five Marathon in South Africa, where he will race on tracks in the African savannah among wild animals and running through the natural habitat of Africa?s ?Big 5? species: Elephant, Rhino, Buffalo, Lion and Leopard.
In August, he will be in South America where he will participate in the INCA Trail Marathon, considered the most challenging and difficult marathon in the world because it takes runners through rocky mountain terrain at altitudes ranging from 8000m above sea level to nearly 14,000m above sea level. The INCA Trail Marathon follows the original pilgrimage trail that leads to Machu Picchu, the religious capital of the Inca Empire.
Hassan Esufally will complete his goal of completing marathons in seven continents of the world when, in December this year, he competes in the fourteenth Antarctic Ice Marathon in Antarctica, which takes place at 80 Degrees South, just a few hundred miles from the South Pole at the foot of the Ellsworth Mountains. This is truly a race for adventure marathoners as it presents formidable weather and running conditions: the underfoot conditions are snow and ice throughout, with an average wind chill temperature of -20?C at an altitude of 700 meters. Runners also face the possibility of having to endure Katabatic winds, strong winds that come down through the polar plateau and can gather speeds of up to 300 kilometers per hour.
The 7 Continents Marathon Club? is an exclusive club of elite marathon runners who have completed some of the most gruelling marathons in the world. At present, there are only 271 members worldwide, 212 male and 59 female members. The Club is exclusive and reserved for athletes who are carefully vetted to prove they have run a marathon within the Antarctic Circle on the Antarctica continent, as well as on the other six continents.

No faith motion will affect PM, not President: SLFP
	
Local Government and Provincial Councils Minister Faizer Musthapha countering the claim of Home Affairs Minister Wajira Abeywardana today said the No Confidence Motion against Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe affected only the PM and not President Maithripala Sirisena.
Addressing the media at the SLFP head office, Minister Musthapha said clauses 48/8 and 44/1 of the Constitution clearly say that if and when a No Confidence Motion against a Prime Minister was passed in Parliament, the PM must step down and the President must appoint as Prime Minister who commands the support of the majority in Parliament.
Responding to a journalist who asked him to comment on Minister Abeywardana?s claim, Minister Musthapha said the Speaker taking over the power in case the No Confidence Motion was passed in Parliament, was his wishful thinking.
Minister Musthapha also said the negative comments on the local government polls held in February under a new electoral system was treacherous?and?malicious because the UNP voted for the new electoral system in Parliament.
Minister Musthapha said the Central Committee of the SLFP would take a decision before April 4 on its stance on the No Confidence Motion and added SLFP members would not take decisions individually but collectively as a party. (Sandun A Jayasekera)
