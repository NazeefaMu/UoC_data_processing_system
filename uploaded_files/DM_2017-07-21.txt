IUSF Convener Lahiru Weerasekara is still behind the bars. The police failed twice to press charges against him. Why dont they release him if he is not guilty, Dr. Aluthge said. (Thilanka kanakarathne)

Be responsible for your decisions
	
- Nelum Senadira, Principal, Musaeus College

The New Ascendant to the Throne of the Musaeus Monarchy talks about her long career in the teaching profession 

With a history of over 125 years that lie behind the gates of Musaeus College-the oldest Buddhist girls school in the country- the halls of the school have been walked on by many a principal that helped bring the school to its standing glory today. The principals of Musaeus College hail a line of strong leadership figures, all of whom were great women that governed the school wisely. Nelum Senadira, the most recent ascendant to the schools top seat as the new principal, prepares to open a new chapter in the history of the school. Possessing a strong willed character, a charismatic personality and a speech that reveals a can-do spirit, Senadira stands worthy of her post and proves that there is no safer pair of hands than hers to be entrusted with the lives of 6500 young girls.Following are excerpts of an interview done with her.

I started the program handling social media safely, where students are made aware of the lurking dangers
	Today many platforms are available for women to be recognized, so more people recognize their skills
	As a school, we provide an extensive variety of sports, clubs and societies for the students
	Of course, my religion, Buddhism, certainly has helped me empathize when with the children
	Parents should co-operate and respect the childs opinion

QAs the principal of Musaeus College, you will be devoting your time to ensure that the students receive an excellent experience in education. How were you influenced in education asa student
I have a family history with Musaeus College. My mother was both a student and a teacher at Musaeus College. Then I followed in her footsteps becoming a student and later on, a teacher at Musaeus. My daughters studied here too. So this became a passion for me. My sister and I studied here at Musaeus College since nursery, completing our primary education here. Then I pursued my higher education from my OLs onwards at Devi Balika. Dr. Wimala De Silva, the founding Principal of Devi Balika, contacted and invited my parents to enroll me and my sister in the school. Those days, Devi Balika was just getting started. I dont regret that too because there I got an opportunity to cut my teeth into leadership skills as I became the schools head girl during my final year. My school days were indeed spent as memorable and happy years of my life. 

The 16 years that I was away from Musaeus College, helped me to gather a lot of experience. Had I only remained at Musaeus, I wouldnt have been able to broaden my horizons. During my time away I visited many countries and was able to have a glimpse of the international education system and standards

QHow did your professional career commence
After ALs I set off to get my academic and professional qualifications after which I returned to school as a teacher. That was way back in 1971. In that role I was then gradually a grade coordinator, a sectional head and then made the grade as vice principal in the late 1990s. Principal at that time was one Mrs. Chitra Abayaratna. After her it was Mrs. Pilapitiya who took on the role of Principal. Later on for personal reasons, I took some time off and stepped away. By that time I had served the school for 16 years. During the time I was away, I worked as the Education USA Advisor for the Fulbright Commission which actually opened up a lot of vistas for me. I worked very closely with secondary school students, university students and even graduates. I developed such close associations with them that I became their Aunty Nelum. I spent 13 years there and it was truly an eye-opener for me. But all good things must come to an end, so it was time for me to retire from that job because the embassy had a retirement age. Then I was asked to take charge of the Gateway Graduate School. I worked there as the head, working closely with all the 4 Gateway International Schools. The 16 years that I was away from Musaeus College, helped me to gather a lot of experience. Had I only remained at Musaeus, I wouldnt have been able to broaden my horizons. During my time away I visited many countries and was able to have a glimpse of the international education system and standards. I met people and developed contacts. I also gained an international perspective. As time passed, the Chairman of Musaeus College contacted and invited me to return to the school as its principal. Finally I took up the offer. I started work, last May.


QAs a school principal, you appear as a role model in the eyes of many. Who did you look up to when you were growing up
Earlier in my life, during my AL years at Devi Balika, Dr. Wimala De Silva became my role model. Being the head girl, I was able to work very closely with her. She was a strict disciplinarian and an absolutely good administrator. Later on, Mrs. Chithra Abayaratna became another great personality that I looked up to. She was the Principal of Musaeus College at the time when I was working there as vice principal. I worked with her as a grade coordinator as well. I admired her a lot. She taught us how to handle work in a very systemic manner. 

I understood that they hadnt even decided about their future plans and goals. They were merely floating about and just jump the hurdles when they get to them. So I also organized a career guidance program for
the students

QYour work experiences have exposed you to the international curriculum too. In comparison, what are your thoughts on the Sri Lankan education system
Over my 30 years of teaching, I have observed that the local education system has gotten complicated with time. I too was a product of the Sri Lankan education system. Our local system has a great deal of breadth and depth which I feel could be made less complicated. In my opinion the Sri Lankan syllabus could be made a little less in content. Local examinations are tough. Today exams have become the driving force in the lives of students in deciding their future and creating an atmosphere of stress and competition. Thats why the tuition trend is predominantly prevalent in the country now. The Sri Lankan system is such that its based on competition. In addition to OLs and ALs, the grade 5 Scholarship has become yet another competitive exam. So the children are geared for competition from a young age. The grade 5 Scholarship started off as one way of getting the really deserving child to a school along with hostel facilities and an opportunity to pursue education. But today competition has become the driving force to succeed at these exams. 

QThe scenario of all work and no play, makes Jack a dull boy is very much prevalent in todays society with exam competition rising sky high. Sports and extra-curricular activities often take a back seat to Academics. How do you plan to ensure a stable equilibrium between the two
It is quite true that nowadays students are more academically inclined due to the extreme exam competition that exists. This leaves no time for students to engage in sports and extra-curricular activities. As a school, we provide an extensive variety of sports, clubs and societies for the students. These facilities are offered free to all students, encouraging them to try out whatever activity they are interested in. This also provides them with an opportunity to try out and explore new experiences and broaden their interests. Students who sit for their OLs attend school right after to commence their ALs which is jumping from one stress to another. This was brought to my attention by a parent. I thought about it and arranged a Skills Acquisition Program for the students who were involved in non-academic activities for 6 days. It was a trial program which included activities such as physical training, counseling seminars, meditation sessions, grooming segments, etiquette programs, arts, crafts, dramas, debates and also included seminars on family planning. The highlight of the program was the segment which dealt with handling social media safely. Speaking to students, I understood that they hadnt even decided about their future plans and goals. They were merely floating about and just jump the hurdles when they get to them. So I also organized a career guidance program for the students. All in all, the trial program was a success and received a lot of positive feedback. I hope to implement such programs in the future too which give students the opportunity to engage in something thats not academic, but helps the students to develop skills which they may require in the future.

Over my 30 years of teaching, I have observed that the local education system has gotten complicated with time. I too was a product of the Sri Lankan education system. Our local system has a great deal of breadth and depth which I feel could be made less complicated

QCompared to the past, the role that women bear at present is much more complicated. They have been given more importance and hold bigger positions than in the by-gone days. What are your thoughts on the roles womenbear today
Yes, more women are exemplified as leadership figures in top most positions and bear a lot of importance in society. But back then, did women have the opportunity to shine out There were many great women who existed in the past who performed their tasks in their own silent ways. Today many platforms are available for women to be recognized with more exposure, media, so more people recognize their skills and are given more importance than back in the day, but I believe that the roles that we bear as women havent changed over the course of time. Women who have found their feet in society are equally dutiful towards their families not having forgotten their obligations to their homes. 

QThe exemplification of women today has added more weight to your responsibility as Principal of a school with over 6500 girls. Do you find it challenging
I dont look at it as a challenge. It has always been my passion to help mold young minds and I look at each one of the students as my own. I am at that age where I am mature enough to have the ability to do that. Of course, my religion, Buddhism, certainly has helped me empathize when with the children, so I am able to reach out to them. In this short time as principal, I know that I have touched a few lives. You really know you have succeeded in doing your job when your past pupils come up to you and say I am this today because of you. Some may say few things, but the message reaches the heart and I feel happy knowing that I am doing my job right. 

My school days were indeed spent as memorable and happy years of my life

QSocial media is becoming a viral trend and is gradually becoming incorporated into young lives. This could lead to interference in academic performances and affect student discipline. How do you plan to approach this issue
I have taken steps towards raising awareness among the students. I started out a program labeled handling social media safely which I previously mentioned, where the students are made aware of the lurking dangers of social media, so they can learn to use social media safely. I am also making arrangements to hold sessions for the teachers, so they are too made aware of this topic and will be able to counsel the children tactfully. We cant condemn social media as this is what surrounds young lives today and we cant stop technology and progression. In fact I feel it is essential to get updated and introduce technology into classrooms and being open minded about new teaching techniques. What we should do is talk about it in a positive and constructive manner all the while making sure that the students are aware of the dangers and how to stay safe when dealing with social media. This is a matter that should be handled sensibly and with sensitivity. 


QOn a final note, what would you choose to offer as a few words of wisdom to the student population of the country
My advice is decide for yourselves and be responsible for your decisions. Having spent over 30 years in the field of teaching, a prominent issue that I have witnessed over the years is that it has become a common situation where children often blame parents for the wrong choices made in their academic future. To avoid such instances it is necessary for the child and parent to communicate openly. The attitude of parents has to change. Parents should co-operate and respect the childs opinion as well. They should provide the support, so that children find the confidence in making their choices. The children have to heed their parents advice too and should research and explore all options and finally choose their path for themselves without forced external influences. Once their decision is made, the child should act responsibly in thepath taken.

Garbage crisis will be resolved soon: PM
	
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said today the government has put in place a well coordinated system to permanently resolve the garbage crisis which has hit Colombo as well as several other cities in the country.
He said this at the opening of the Colombo National Book Fair organized by the Public Library.
Several cities including Kandy are facing a garbage crisis. The intention of the government is to implement a coordinated effort by all local government bodies, provincial councils, government ministers including the Megapolis Minister to resolve resolve this matter permanently, the Premier said.
The main problem is to find land-fill sites. The garbage crisis cannot be solved with a proper disposal method. Colombo was a small town before 1977, the population was low, there was not much of garbage and not many industries. The quantity of garbage has gradually increased. Meetotumulla was originally selected as a dump in the early 1990s. The government in 1994 decided to stop dumping dumping garbage in Meetotumulla after a protest. Accordingly it was decided to use the dump at a site on Bloemendhal Road as a temporary solution but there were legal issues. Courts issued a stay order on dumping garbage at that site. The 2002 UNP government was was working out a permanent solution but could not finalise it because Parliament was dissolved. Later it was decided to use Meetotumulla again as a garbage dump once again.
He said the government had looked at a location in Puttalam to dump garbage and at several other places as a temporary measure.
"Courts issued stay orders against dumping in some places amid protests. CMC Workers were harassed. The permanent solution depends on identifying and resolving the main issue which gave rise to the crisis. The Megapolis Ministry has selected a suitable location to dump garbage at Puttalam. It is not possible just to dump garbage as it has to be managed. It will take two years to manage the disposal. This location could be used for ten years to do so," the Premier said. (Yohan Perera)

Mount of Saturn  what markings say
	
Human Hand - Trailblazer of Human Civilization -Part 18

BY A.S. Fernando.
There are certain markings which add strength to the Mount of Saturn singly or in combination. They are the Triangle, Trident, Circle, Square, or the single vertical line.
The Grille, Cross, Island, or Cross bars indicate defects either in health or in character.
The lines on the Mount of Saturn which are found on palms and what each of them signifies are given below.

One single line: Great luck
	One deep line forming the end of a broken Line of Fate: A life characterized by tranquility and monotony
	Two parallel lines: Success late in life after much effort.
	Number of lines: Many lines on the Mount bring bad luck
	Several lines crossing the Mount and the Line of Heart: A misfortune
What other signs on the Mount of Saturn indicate:
A cross: Childlessness, infertility and impotency
	A star: Paralysis or death sentence for committing murder
	A star with the Line of Fate entering deeply into the Finger of Saturn: Danger of assassination.
	A square: Safe from calamities
	A star within a square: Escape from assassination
	A triangle: A special aptitude for occult sciences
The Grille, Cross, Island, Dot or Cross bars also signify defects either in health or in character.
Displacement of the Mounts
The Mounts are usually formed at the base of Fingers from which they derive the name. But one or two mounts on certain palms are found displaced or inclining towards an adjoining mount.
Locating a displaced mount would pose a problem to a novice to palmistry. Therefore, please note that if an elevation is found between the bases of the first and second fingers, it means the Mount of Jupiter is inclining towards the Mount of Saturn or the latter is leaning towards the Mount of Jupiter. If the Mount of Saturn inclines towards the Mount of Jupiter, the subject is obsessed with a morbid pride.
If the Mount of Saturn leans towards the Mount of Sun, the subject is very ambitious and hard working. He would achieve his goals in life by the dint of perseverance.
If the Mount of Saturn inclines towards the Line of Heart, the subject is very sentimental and love would bring him much sorrow.

RDA bulldozes Colombo Swimming Club pool area
	
The Colombo Swimming Club (CSC) Officials today said that they were taken by surprise when the Road Development Authority (RDA) officials entered their premises with a Court Order and started demolishing the buildings and walls behind the CSC swimming pool, to make way for the Colombo Extension of the Marine Drive without prior notice.
President of the CSC Tony De Livera told the Daily Mirror the RDA officials arrived at the scene with armed Police, shocking club members and started demolishing surrounding the pool area without getting any permission from the CSC authorities.
Without noticing the trustees of the club, the RDA, along with the Police, came to the club and said that they were going to take over the premises of the club on a Court Order, he said.
I cant understand the urgency to destroy a property that has been here since 1936, he said.
There were people in the pool, especially children and women. When the authorities suddenly showed up they rushed away as they got scared of the armed Police, he said.
Mr. De Livera also said the baby pool and the play zone were completely destroyed leaving it open to stagnant water - an ideal place for dengue mosquitoes to breed.
No notice was given, they have timed it perfectly. Crashing in on a Friday afternoon they knew we would be unable to go to Court to get an injunction, he said.
Meanwhile, the members of the club questioned the motive behind the project to start from the CSC leaving out the premises of the American Embassy and other commercial sites.
However, RDA sources said that the Court Order to take over the land was issued on July 7 and it included most of the pool area as well.
Club members expressed concern over the way it was handled and said that they feared the CSCs pride and the existence would be threatened by RDAs move.
The CSC established in 1936 is now seventy five years old. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

Saudi prince who physically abused men and women arrested
	
Saudi Arabia, (Daily Mail,), 20 July 2017 -  A Saudi prince has been arrested on the orders of a furious King Salman after videos appearing to show the young royal abusing men and women emerged. 
The footage went viral and came to the attention of the Saudi King, who issued an immediate warrant for the Prince Saud bin Abdulaziz bin Musaed bin Saud bin Abdulaziz Al Sauds arrest and imprisoned everyone involved in the verbal and physical attacks.  Citizens were left with blood dripping from their mouths and wounds on their faces as the prince appears to wave a gun at the camera and punch a man repeatedly in the head. Prince Saud appears to feature at the beginning and the end of the video, first punching a bloodied man in the head and then sitting in a car waving a gun around.  Other clips show citizens being hit in the head, having rifles pointed at them and one shows a group of women being abused.

Sri Lankan literature featured in City
	
Quarterly Journal of South Asian Literature re-launched

Sri Lankan literature may not be well known around the world compared to its counterpart India. But international editors have now begun to take a keen interest in Sri Lankan writing. The latest effort to give prominence to the budding talent in Sri Lanka came from the re-launch of City, a quarterly journal of South Asian literature. The journal features writings of 26 Sri Lankan writers which includes fiction and poetry. The journal also includes prose and poetry of other South Asian writers. 
Speaking at the launch of the journal at the ICES auditorium, acclaimed writer Ameena Hussein expressed that the stories in the journal offered the reality of life as it is stripping it down from misconceptions. This is a rare opportunity for the diverse voices writing in all three languages to sit side by side representing the country as a holistic voice, rather than the fragments we are used to seeing, she said.
From this selection you will see that Sri Lankan writers write with spirit in whatever language they write in. They are modern and old fashioned, and nostalgic, and angry and rebellious and charming all at the same time, she added. She also found the stories written by other South Asian writers to be spunky and feisty. 
City began as a quarterly journal in 2002. Its Co-Editor, Ajmal Kamal said that it was a journal devoted to civic issues. It is about how city functions and the role played by the city in our lives. The journal presents literature of South Asia in English. 
We are aware of literature of so many parts of the world, but we are not aware of the literature of our neighbours, Kamal remarked. 
There are a number of young people who have a better command of English than their predecessors, who are very keen to present their masterpieces of their languages and literature. We want to invite all of them to join in our effort to create this kind of platform which can lead to a better understanding of what we are as South Asians, he said speaking at the launch.

This is a rare opportunity for the diverse voices writing in all three languages to sit side by side representing the country as a holistic voice, rather than the fragments we are used to seeing

On a critical note of Sri Lankan writing, the publishing industry in the country and the opportunity offered by City Dr. Harshana Rambukwella, a Senior Lecturer at the Postgraduate Institute of English, of the Open University of Sri Lanka, said that while world literature experimented, deconstructed and rebuilt, in Sri Lanka writers wanted to preserve. By doing so we stagnated. Our imaginations were imprisoned by a sense of national and cultural fidelity. We wanted to be filial sons and daughters to the nation and thereby misunderstood and misplaced the role of the liberated writer, he said. 
He further claimed that the publishing industry was in a crisis. Many novels are published every year. At least over a hundred. All the publishers say that its very difficult to push more than a thousand or two thousand books even in Sinhala. The ones that win awards may sell around five thousand or eight thousand copies, he noted pointing out that in the 1950s and 60s the publishing industry flourished with sales hitting 30 000. That was a time when our population was much much smaller. So what has happened he quizzed. One possible explanation is the conservativeness of our
literary discourse. 

Speakers at the event

Against this backdrop Dr.Rambukwella perceives the journal magazine to be arefreshing departure from the conservative cultural discourse. The very title of the magazine challenges us to think about South Asian realities from a new perspective. South Asia, and in particular Sri Lanka was seen as a rural space and this magazine invites us to consider the urban realities of South Asia, he explained. 
He invited readers to delve into the collection to discover the city within us as well as the cities that we inhabit. 
In conversation with the Co-editor of City, Ajmal Kamal
Ajmal Kamal hails from Karachi in Pakistan where he runs a publishing house. He is the editor of a literary magazine in Urdu called Aj which translated to today. It was started as a quarterly magazine in 1989 and its hundredth issue was published last month. The magazine contains translations of literary work ofdifferent languages. 
Through contacts developed by working on Aj, and through his colleagues at the South Asian University where Kamal is currently studying for his doctorate, Kamal has been able to collaborate with other writers in South Asia. This has facilitated the re-launch of City which had come to a halt after four issues were published initially. City is also co-edited by Sophia Naz, a poet who also hails from Pakistan and currently resides in the United States. 
We are more aware of things being written in the West and other places. We dont know what is happening with the languages of our neighbours. Indian literature is better known than that of Sri Lanka, Nepal and Pakistan because of its size and diversity. So we thought that we will start with Sri Lanka. We issued a call for submissions on facebook and through email, and we got a good response, Kamal told Daily Mirror. 
This issue has a special section on Sri Lankan writings, so that people can have an idea of what themes are being written about in Sri Lanka. Similarly in the next issue we will feature writings from Nepal, he added. 
Apart from writings originally in English, the issue also contains translations from Sinhala, Bangla. Urdu, Tamil and Nepali. The Sri Lankan writing presented is authentic, poignant, descriptive and is set in a Sri Lankan setting to capture the Sri Lankan experience.

Top French general quits over row with President Macron
	

(Daily Mail,), 20 July 2017-Frances most senior military officer resigned yesterday following an unprecedented public row with President Emmanuel Macron over 750m-worth of military cuts. 
General Pierre De Villiers, 61, even posted comments on Facebook about it at one stage, prompting 39-year-old Mr Macron to accuse him of washing dirty linen in public. 
In turn, the General said savage reductions in budgets meant he could no longer guarantee the protection of France and French people. 
He handed in his resignation on Wednesday morning.  Mr Macrons biggest political crisis to date highlights the problems he is having as he tries to make 53bn-worth of EU austerity savings while also keeping an election pledge to cut taxes. 
Last week, the President  who is also Commander in Chief of Frances armed forces  said he wanted to cut the 2017 defence budget to help bring his countrys deficit below the EU limit of three per cent of gross domestic product.

REUTERS, 20th JULY, 2017- The Trump administration has decided to halt the CIAs covert program to equip and train certain rebel groups fighting the government of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, two U.S. officials said, a move sought by Assad ally Russia.
The U.S. decision, said one of the officials, is part of an effort by the administration to improve relations with Russia, which along with Iranian-supported groups has largely succeeded in preserving Assads government in the six-year-civil war.

Trump slams AG  warns special prosecutor not  to pry into his family business
	

President Trump took aim at Jeff Sessions, fired FBI director James Comey and Robert Mueller in a no-holds barred interview on Wednesday. 
Speaking to The New York Times, he admonished Sessions, the attorney general, for recusing himself from the Russia investigation and said he never would have given him the position had he known ahead of time.Next in the firing line was ousted FBI director James Comey. 
Trump said he believed Comey, who he fired in May, was leveraging the now infamous dirty dossier of made-up material that was supposed to incriminate the president and his connections to Russia in order to keep his job. 
In his interview on Tuesday, the president did not shy away from discussing the investigations new leader, Robert Mueller. 
While Trump insisted to the Times that he would never instruct the Justice Department to fire Mueller, he did warn that if he turned the investigation towards his familys finances beyond Russia, he would consider it going too far. 
I think thats a violation. Look, this is about Russia, he said. 
He also claimed that Muellers office was rife was conflicts of interest and said confidently: I dont think were under investigation. Im not under investigation. For what I didnt do anything wrong. 
The president also touched on his meeting with Vladimir Putin after the G20 summit, claiming the pair only spoke for 15 minutes and that the conversation was about Russias ban on US citizens adopting children from the country.

Universal medical science: A blessing for curing multiple diseases: Rajitha
	
If we could continue all the medical experiments in all the medical sciences, it would help to fill up all the loopholes by adding them to one, and that could be the result of creating of the Universal Medical Science which would be to cure all the diseases, Health and indigenous Minister Dr. Rajitha Senarathne said.
Addressing an appreciation ceremony at the Sri Lanka Ayurvedic Drugs Corporation for its achievement of gaining profit of Rs.3.5 billion for this year, he said if appropriate medicine experiments would be conducted to Ayurvedic medicine it would help to make Universal Medical Science.
Several steps have been taken to develop Ayurvedic medicine. The Ministry had decided to convert the written language of the palm leaf manuscripts to understandable local languages. Therefore doctors could gain more knowledge by reading those books. Accordingly, about 600 palm leaf manuscripts had been brought to the Ayurvedic Drugs Corporation at Navinna and began translating them, Dr. Senarathne said.
There was no pharmacopoeia in the Ayurvedic medicine but there is a British pharmacopoeia in western medicine. In British pharmacopoeia, it had included all the details about the drugs in Western Medicine, but unfortunately there is no such pharmacopoeia in the Ayurvedic medicine, he said.
Therefore, the Ministry had started to build a pharmacopoeia in the Ayurvedic medicine. Making of the Ayurvedic pharmacopoeia was handed over to several professors. There is no proper Medical Council in the Ayurvedic Medicine and a proposal has been made today to form a new Medical Council. Likewise, the Ministry is to provide equal rights and standards to Ayurvedic Department similar to Health Department.
The Health Ministry has decided to call an International Medicine Conference at the end of November this year. If this conference would be held end of November this year was success, Sri Lanka would become the centre point of the Medical Science of Alternate Medical Colleges in the world.
During the discussion, the topics of Lankan and Indian Ayurvedic medicine, German Homoeopathy, Korean medical technique etc will be discussed, and about 82 countries would be participating the event in order to discuss their own medicinal techniques. (Chaturanga Pradeep)

60, 40 & 30 Years Ago in July: Triumphs and Bungling by JRJ
	
Opposed B-C Pact 57- Green Revolution- 77 - Indo-SL Pact 87

It is a lack of courage on my part, a lack of intelligence on my part, a lack of foresight on my part -J R Jayewardene, Executive President of Socialist Democratic Republic of Sri Lanka 
Sunday Observer of August 16, 1987, reported a distraught Sri Lankan Head of State, who was seated by the side of Indian PM Rajiv Gandhi at the media briefing that followed the signing of Indo-Lanka pact in 1987, making a confession when answering a journalist who queried, why he had not moved earlier on reaching an agreement with Tamil leadership. 
Lessons from the month of July, Mondays DM editorial prompted me to reflect on how JR Jayewardene responded to July. Unfortunately, as the editorial highlights, we have not learnt dangers of fostering and enhancing differences. 

JR-Jayewardene

Green Revolution July 77
In a state sponsored Tighten-your-belts economy in early 1970s, the privileged enjoyed all the luxuries while the poor masses were searching for eatables in the citys garbage bins. The closed economy, marred by scarcities and undemocratic postponement of elections, nationalization of plantations, acquisition of private properties of opponents and corporate buildings during the seven years under the United Front, was led by SLFP. (The huge three storey new wing at Galle Road, Colpetty owned by Shaw Wallace and Hedges, where the writer was employed, was taken over in 1976 for the Plantations Ministry by pinning on the gate a 30-day notice of acquisition How sensible are the men of Good Governance; they even pay Rs 20 to 25 Million as monthly rental for over 16 months for an unoccupied premises) From 1970 to 75, Marxist LSSP and CP leaders dropped their, revolution round the corner slogan and accepted four key cabinet portfolios including Finance.
Sirimavo Bandaranaikes SLFP encouraged hostility and division between racial and religious extremists groups causing national fragmentation, a common feature under Bandaranaike governments prior to Chandrika. The 1970-77 United Front rule dragged the country to devastation without direction or control, a situation similar to the present unity regime. 

SWRD Bandaranaike

JR, let down by his Western friends, especially the US, had little option, but to agree. There was no imminent external help, particularly after the Indian Air Force violated air space and dropped Parippu in Jaffna
The untimely death of loved-by-all Dudley Senanayake occurred during this time, crowning relatively unpopular JR Jayewardene to lead the UNP. The veteran politician had a generation of learned young visionary politicians backed by an abundance of smart men in the public service at his disposal. The conditions that prevailed coupled with the admirable organizational skills of JR helped UNP record a comprehensive electoral victory with five-sixth of the seats under the first-past-the-post at General elections held in July 1977. The results were met with jubilation and hope by the public. 
The governments role in the economy was minimised under a deregulated economy, inviting foreign investments. Gigantic 30-year Mahaweli Diversion Programme was accelerated to six years and it was entrusted to dynamic Gamini Dissanayake. Infrastructure developed and the Free Trade Zones opened, attracting investors and creating jobs for the unemployed youth. The first five years (77-82) saw a speedy economic revival under a stable government led by the political colossus JR. He occupied the Executive Presidency using 5/6 for amending the Constitution. However, as the next national elections approached, fear a psychosis marooned the entire government leadership; popularity of Sirimavo gained momentum in spite of attempted mud-sling campaign. Calling for undated resignation letters; rolling of electoral maps, jailing or withdrawal of civic rights of opposition leaders and, holding referendums in place of general elections, employing thugs and hooligans to thwart demonstrations, depriving Sirimavo of civic rights, splitting the main opposition SLFP and rigging of elections using armed thugs were notable features of the post 1982 Jayewardene rule. 

Indo-SL Pact 87 inviting Indias direct Intervention in our affairs
The Rajiv-Jayewardene Accord or more popularly known, Indo-Sri Lanka Pact was perhaps too pushy in its extent and capacity as it expected to address two controversial issues between India and Sri Lanka; strategic interests and Tamil minority rights. The pact marked the commencement of a process which led to the creation of provincial councils. The pact received secondary importance when leaders who opposed the signing of accord assumed power in both countries around the same time. These unpleasant developments marred the understanding of the positive features of the pact which enabled Tamils to gain some recognition regarding their demands in the Constitution 
Junius Richard Jayewardene was known as an American sympathizer even during his school days; hence, his leftist anti-American contemporaries [Dr Colvin schoolmate and Dr NM at Ceylon University College] nicknamed him Yankee Dickie, [Dickie being short form for Richard].  The pact was agreed upon after India arm-twisted President JR to sign it. The Agreement represented a calculated move rather than a diplomatic initiative. JR, let down by his Western friends, especially the US, had little option, but to agree. There was no imminent external help, particularly after the Indian Air Force violated air space and dropped Parippu in Jaffna. Indian High Commissioner J N Dixit, warned, Act now, indicating their intentions to use force if Sri Lanka ignored Indian concerns. Black July 1983, another bungling by Jayewardene, burdened India with some 120000 refugees who fled to Tamil Nadu.

On that fateful day Jayewardene was addressing a protest meeting in Colombo when hundreds of Mahasangha invaded the PMs residence at Rosemead Place compelling the shaky decision maker to abrogate the pact

Hooligans, assisted by sections of the Army and receiving the blessings of a few chauvinistic ministers, engrossed the nation with flames of inferno. Innocent Tamils living in Colombo and other parts suffered while President JR played Nero for four days fearing a military reprisal. His inaction worsened the situation. The killing of 13 soldiers on July 23 in 1983 by LTTE provided the government goons a reason to get on killing, arson and looting. Forgetting that the majority of Tamils, both in Jaffna and in the upcountry voted for him a year before, Jayewardene made the following statement during an interview with a British journalist, 
I am not worried about the opinion of the Jaffna people nowwe cant think of them. Not about their lives or their opinions of us... The more you put pressure on the North, the happier the Sinhalese people will be hereDaily Telegraph-July 11, 1983-
The interview was republished in the Ceylon Observer- on July 17.It is people, not treaties, which make relations between nations meaningful. Unless India makes a difference in the lives of the people of both countries, its relations with Sri Lanka will not address the broader aspects of strategic security. This is the important takeaway as we look at the Rajiv-Jayewardene Accord. -Col. R. Hariharan : Head of intelligence-- IPKF 1987- 1990

Bandaranaike-Chelvanayakam Pactof July 1957
An accord signed between the Prime Minister, SWRD Bandaranaike and the leader of Federal Party, the main Tamil political entity, SJV Chelvanayakam on July 26, 1957, exactly 60 years ago, is known as B-C Pact. It promoted the establishment of several Regional Councils in the island as a means to giving autonomy to the Tamil people living in the North-East of the country. It was anticipated that it would find solutions to the communal difference present at the time. On the very day, the UNP working committee met and issued a statement condemning the pact as a betrayal of the Sinhalese. Earlier, in 1956 February, at its Annual Sessions at Kelaniya, the UNP adopted an unprincipled Sinhala only official language resolution, which the party used as an election promise in 1956. Jayawardene held discussions with extremists groups and well-known racists who broke off with Bandaranaike, to form a common front. [MSS File 317-JRJ Centre carries a paper with his own handwriting, showing that he was in touch with racist, KMP Rajaratne who vowed to wear slippers made out of the skin of the last Tamil in the island, LH Mettananda and Ven Baddegama Wimalawansa- the monk who led the satyagraha at Rosemead Pl.] 
Jayewardene fashioned policies, planned strategies and tactics to challenge the pact, ignoring disastrous consequences. On August 3, UNP issued a second communiqu also drafted by him, which said, a step towards the achievement of an Independent Tamil State,this pact recognizes the division of the country into two parts, North and East forming one and the rest another
Young Bandaranaike returning from Oxford in 1920s formed a political party and wrote a six piece article to Ceylon Morning Leader in May/June 1926, professing Federalism for Ceylon. He soon realized the political certainties, shed his ideology and religion and formed the Sinhala Maha Sabha. The rest is history. 
The pact was vehemently opposed by sections of the Sinhalese-Buddhist community and the main opposition UNP, which held Protests island wide ending up with a massive walk- Padayatra- from Colombo to Kandy.A reluctant Dudley Senanayake was invited to inaugurate it on the first day, but he didnt actually participate in it. The march came under attack at Imbulgoda on its third day forcing Jayewardene to return home. Bandaranaike was compelled to abrogate the pact nine months later in April 1958. On that fateful day Jayewardene was addressing a protest meeting in Colombo when hundreds of Mahasangha invaded the PMs residence at Rosemead Place compelling the shaky decision maker to abrogate the pact. The tearing up led to anxiety between the two communities, causing a series of eruptions of racial violence in the country which ultimately led to a 30-year Civil War. Bandaranaikes subsequent attempts to enact legislation parallel to the pact was met with strong resistance, which ultimately led to his assassination by an extremist monk a year later in 1959. Of all the destructive forces that campaigned against the Pact, UNPs was the most effective.
It was Tarzie Vittachi, who said, When a government however popular, begins to pander to racial or religious emotionalism merely because it is the loudest of raucous demands made on it, and then meddles in the administration and enforcement of law and order for the benefit of its favourites or to win the plaudits of the crowds, however hysterical it may be, catastrophe is certain  Emergency 58- Deutsch: Pge 7

Sri Lanka President JR Jayawardene (right) and Indian Premier RAjiv Gandhi sign

Jayewardene, in 1940s, placed a proposal in Parliament to declare Sinhala only as the official language. A resolution in 1944 specifying that Sinhalese and Tamil would become the languages of instruction in schools, and in courts was approved, but with little progress in implementation. In 1956, Bandaranaikes pledge to the voter Sinhala Only in 24 hours followed by language-wise standardization by Sirimavo in 1971 and the district quota system in 1972, which had serious impacts on Tamil students contributing to the conflict even though Tamil had been declared an official language in 1987, by the 13th Amendment. The destruction caused by the politics of language remains unsolved.

The first five years (77-82) saw a speedy economic revival under a stable government led by the political colossus JR. He occupied the Executive Presidency using 5/6 for amending the Constitution.

SWRD announced abrogation of the B-C pact at Tintegel Rosmead Place to pacify the Buddhist clergy and other racists on that fateful evening of April 9, while Jayewardene addressed a rally at Abeysinharamaya, Maradana to welcome the abrogation, described SWRD as a man, who was prepared to barter away the rights of the Sinhalese,
Prof. Howard Wriggins and Prof. K M de Silva, JRs Political Biographers say in Vol II Page-50; that he arrived at Breamar Ward Place and made the following endorsement for the day in his diary- 
this is disgraceful conduct on the part of a PM, who has signed an agreement.
A famous quote says, 
Hypocrisy is the mother of all evil and racial prejudice is still her favourite child.
