I was forced into a deal with India, J.R. Jayewardene told U.S. envoy: Report
	
Sri Lanka was forced into making a deal with India as its own armed forces had twice refused to take Jaffna, then President J.R. Jayewardene has been quoted as saying in a declassified document, nearly 30 years after the Indian Peace Keeping Force (IPKF) was deployed in the island nation.
Jayewardene told visiting American diplomat Peter Galbraith that he had twice ordered his troops to take Jaffna  burn the place to the ground  and they had talked him out of it on grounds of unacceptably high casualties.
A little over 1,200 Indian soldiers died in IPKF operations against the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam in northern and eastern Sri Lanka between 1987 and 1990. In May 1991, former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, who had signed the July 1987 peace deal with Jayewardene, was assassinated by the LTTE.
In response to significant promises of devolution of powers to the Tamil minority and recognition of Tamil as an official language, India agreed to provide military assistance  the IPKF  to ensure peace according to the 1987 Gandhi-Jayewardene accord.
He [Mr. Jayewardene] made clear that he shared the GOIS [Government of Indias] implacable hostility toward Prabakaran, calling the LTTE leader a mad fellow,  a declassified CIA document said about the February 1988 conversation.
He stressed, though without obvious bitterness, that none of his outside friends would help him, so he had no choice but to make a deal with India, the CIA document read.
Interestingly, the then President opened up to Mr. Galbraith and said he would hold elections in the Tamil-populated northern and eastern provinces in Sri Lanka. Polls were finally held in November 1988.
Mr. Galbraith also provides an insight into the relations between the IPKF and the Sri Lankan Army (SLA), and the ground situation in the Jaffna peninsula after being flown to the area during his visit.
the IPKF and the Sri Lankan forces are getting on well together, andthe situation in Jaffna, while still far from normal, is gradually improving, the American diplomat said in an assessment.
An SLA officer, Brigadier Jayaratne, is quoted in the memo as saying: The IPKF is doing a jolly good job in Jaffna. He added that the SLA and the Indian troops were getting along famously, like a house on fire.
The document recounted that the Indian officers were warm and responsive in their interaction with the American visitors, which included Mr. Galbraith and the then U.S. Ambassador to Sri Lanka.
It appears that the Americans also played a behind-the-scenes role in ensuring channels of communication between President Jayewardene and Prime Minister Gandhi, a second declassified CIA document said.
In 1986, Jayewardene held a very negative view of India given that New Delhi had been training Tamil insurgents as he conveyed to visiting U.S. Senator Charles H. Percy. I am a very peaceful man. But Indias role in this [ethnic] matter is reprehensible and the Indians have to be held responsible for their actions. Percy, who carried a letter from U.S. President Ronald Reagan to Jayewardene, offered to be of assistance in conveying any message from the Sri Lankan President to Rajiv Gandhi.
Indian intervention
Interestingly, a third CIA intelligence assessment of September 1986 stated that India was rapidly expanding its armed forces to intervene in Sri Lanka.
India, it said, was improving its ability to deploy airborne troops. The paratroopers probably would try to seize an airfield so that reinforcements could be brought in by air. U.S. defence attach sources report the Army and Air Force practised such an operation late last year [1985] at Trivandrum, with the assault force receiving offshore fire support from Navy ships. Trivandrum, the memo argued, resembled Colombo in topography.
In the CIAs assessment, India would intervene in Sri Lanka in two scenarios  one, if the government collapsed and, the other, if Tamil insurgents established a separate State.
In our view, an Indian intervention would most likely come [exactly what happened in 1987], as in 1971 [to deal with Marxist insurgents] following a request from Colombo to help in restoring internal order, the assessment said.
Interestingly, the CIA believed that the poorly trained Sri Lankan Army would offer token resistance and opposition to a prolonged Indian intervention would come from Tamil and, possibly, Sinhala insurgents.
In a prescient observation, the memo concluded: If New Delhi continues to oppose a separate Tamil state, we believe Tamil insurgents would resist the Indians as they now do the Sinhalese.(The Hindu)

Mahendran spent Rs.66mn for his own purposes: VAC
	
Former Central Bank Governor Arjuna Mahendran spent Rs.66mn of Central Bank funds on 163 occasions during a span of 21 months for his own purposes, Voice against Corruption (VAC) Convener Wasantha Samarasinghe alleged today.
He said his allegations were based on an audit report prepared by the CB's Internal Audit Department and that the money allegedly embezzled was second only to the infamous bond issue, in which Mr. Mahendran is also said to be involved.
The audit report gives details of Mr. Mahendrans foreign tours and his credit card bills during his tenure up to August 1, 2016. He has failed to produce valid invoices for the 163 occasions he had either purchased goods for himself or had paid hotel bills. On one occasion he is known to have bought a blazer for Rs.2,000,000, Mr. Samarasinghe said.
The audit report had found more irregularities with regard to Mr. Mahendrans expenditure in one instance he had produced two invoices for staying at two separate hotels on the same day.
Attention had been diverted from Mr. Mahendrans misuse of funds with the bond issue coming to the forefront. He is friend of the Prime Minister and also works under him. Former Police Special Task Force Chief has been imprisoned on charges of misusing Rs.140,000 and if so Mr. Mahendran should also be put behind bars for a longer period, he said.
The parliamentary Committee on Public Enterprises (COPE), in its final report on the CB Bond issue held CB's former Governor Arjuna Mahendran directly responsible for the questionable transaction and urged legal action.
Mr. Samarasinghe said the VAC would complain to the Police Financial Crimes Investigation Division (FCID) as well. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

Ranjan complains to BC against Div. Sec.
	
Deputy Minister Ranjan Ramanayake has complained to the Bribery Commission (BC) against the Divulapitiya Divisional Secretary with whom he was at loggerheads recently.
He told Daily Mirror he had lodged the complaint on Friday. In his complaint he alleged that 61 000 cubes of sand had been removed through sand mining despite the Geological Surveys and Mines Bureau (GSMB) having given permission to remove only 500 cubes of sand.
The Bribery Commission is likely to obtain a court order to examine her phone and her tab records, the deputy minister said.
He said he saw no reason as to why he should apologise to the divisional secretary.
She and others who supported her are the ones who should apologise because it has now been proved that she and the others were involved in a fraud. The removal of GSMB officer is clear evidence that a fraud had taken place during sand mining. (Yohan Perera)

Some newcomers try to create problems - Ravi
	
A few members who joined in the government, after its formation by the President and the Prime Minister on good governance principles, try to create problems for the government while enjoying ministerial portfolios. They should realise that the President and the Prime Minister have engaged in one integrated journey, said Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake today.
He said those who worked full time to prevent the formation of the good governance government later joined the same administration and their current attempt to put the government in trouble is clear evidence of their malice.
The minister paid homage to the Dalada Maligawa and later paid courtesy calls on the Mahanayake Theras of the Malwathu and the Asgiri Chapters and received their blessings. Mr. Karunanayake told the media, outside the temple, that he was taking directives only from the president and the prime minister. He said he was not ready to be dictated to by ministers.
He said the duty of the government was to implement the mandate given by the people and criticism by certain persons who got ministerial positions through bargains was futile.
He said the budget allocations for some of inactive ministries had been cut and the relevant ministers were complaining, but he was not going to answer such calls made due to abdominal pain. He added that the government was making a people friendly journey by cutting taxes and minimising waste and corruption.
He said the country would fall into crisis if the government was going to work according to the statements issued by some provincial governors and chief ministers and that the president and the prime minister were doing enough according to the Constitution and protecting the sovereignty of the country while maintaining harmony among all communities.
The good governance has walked an extra mile to restore not just five-star democracy but seven-star democracy in the island. Neither white-van culture nor abductions are reported today. No incident of assault is reported either. However, the process of bringing the perpetrators to book for the irregularities committed during the previous regime is delayed because i is being done according to the law," he said.
The minister told the two Mahanayakes that the proposals made by them to be considered for Budget 2017 had been included. The Mahanayakes had proposed that a monthly stipend be granted to student monks. He said a mechanism to pay the stipend would be worked out on the advice of the Mahanayakes.
Responding to the minister, the Malwathu Mahanayake said that a country cannot move without revenue. He said that it was the responsibility of the government to maintain reasonable prices of essential commodities despite various public tariffs.
Mr. Karunanayake said the present government had taken measures to bring down the prices of 24 essential items.

## Title: Trump bid to reinstate travel ban fails

Trump bid to reinstate travel ban fails
	
The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit announced early Sunday morning that it has denied the Department of Justice's emergency motion -- filed late Saturday -- to issue an immediate stay on a Washington State judge's temporary restraining order of President Donald Trump's controversial travel ban.
"The court has received appellants' emergency motion (Docket Entry No. 14)," read the order from the appeals court. "Appellants' request for an immediate administrative stay pending full consideration of the emergency motion for a stay pending appeal is denied."
Lawyers from Washington State and Minnesota, who brought the challenge to court in Seattle, have until Sunday at 11:59 p.m. Pacific Time to file a response to the Department of Justice's request. The Justice Department then has until Monday 3 p.m. Pacific Time to file a reply brief.
Lawyers for the Department of Justice argued in the filing that the restraining order is "vastly overboard," and it "second-guesses" the commander in chief.
"The injunction contravenes the constitutional separation of powers; harms the public by thwarting enforcement of an Executive Order issued by the nation's elected representative responsible for immigration matters and foreign affairs; and second-guesses the Presidents national security judgment about the quantum of risk posed by the admission of certain classes of aliens and the best means of minimizing that risk," Department of Justice lawyers wrote in the filing.
Six key arguments in the brief are as follows:
--The actions taken through the executive order were authorized by an act of Congress and also were taken pursuant to the president's exclusive power as commander in chief and over foreign policy.
--Immigration is an issue dedicated to the executive.
--National security issues are the sole province of the president, not the courts.
--The order does not discriminate by religion, just country of origin.
--It excludes foreign states from sending people to the United States for a temporary period.
--All of the countries at issue were deemed sponsors of terror by prior administrations.
The motion cites separate federal court opinion issued Friday in Massachusetts which rejected a request to suspend the executive order.
As ABC News reported earlier Saturday, the Trump administration had filed a formal notice of appeal of the temporary restraining order of the travel ban.
After a federal judge in Seattle issued a nationwide restraining order halting parts of the executive action signed by President Donald Trump that temporarily bars some immigrants and refugees from seven predominantly Muslim countries, the White House promised to appeal the ruling "at the earliest possible time."
The ruling, issued by U.S. District Judge James L. Robart -- a nominee of President George W. Bush who was confirmed 99-0 in June 2004 -- took effect immediately, said Washington State Solicitor General Noah Purcell during a press conference.
Washington State Attorney General Bob Ferguson called the decision "historic" and "important."
"It puts a halt to President Trump's unconstitutional and unlawful executive order," Ferguson said. (ABC)

VK Sasikala to be next Tamil Nadu CM
	
VK Sasikala- the longtime companion of J Jayalalithaa who became the party chief after her death - has been elected the chief of AIADMK's legislature party, clearing the decks for her takeover as the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu, NDTV reported.
O Panneerselvam, the current incumbent of the post who had proposed her name at the party's internal meeting this afternoon, announced his resignation. Ms Sasikala's elevation ends a period of intense speculation and fulfils the vociferous demands of a section of the party who contended that it was unwise to for the party and government to have different power centres in the state.
After the announcement, Ms Sasikala appeared in front of supporters on the balcony where the former Chief Minister often seen, hands folded, in a dark green sari -- a colour greatly favoured by Ms Jayalalithaa. Tamil Nadu's Iron Lady had even worn the colour after the sweeping victory of the AIADMK in the last assembly elections.
In her lifetime, Ms Jayalalithaa occupied both posts and after taking charge of the party, Ms Sasikala had promised to follow in her footsteps. It was expected that she would take over as chief minister by the end of January, but the massive protests over Jallikattu had delayed it, sources had said.
Party leaders have said the pending disproportionate assets case against Ms Sasikala will be no impediment to her takeover as the Chief Minister. Though she has been acquitted in the case along with Jayalalithaa, the verdict on an appeal is pending before the Supreme Court.
The opposition DMK has protested, asking how Ms Sasikala, who has no political or administrative experience, can be picked to lead the government. "She has no experience. Was not even elected, don't know what her policies are. How can she be CM" said a senior leader of the party.
Ms Sasikala, 61, is not an elected member of the assembly and had never held any post in the party. Chinamma (mother's younger sister) as she is fondly called by supporters had taken charge of the party after a lot of coaxing from the partymen. After her acceptance, there have been calls for the 65-year-old Mr Panneerselvam - a Jayalalithaa loyalist who took over the top job after her death -- to step down.
Ms Sasikala's takeover has been preceded by a series of changes both in the government and the party. On Friday, a team of bureaucrats appointed by Ms Jayalalithaa had been shifted. On Friday, Ms Sasikala also added 23 people to the existing 38 office bearers at the headquarters. (NDTV)

Wiggys hybrid court is a dream that will not materialise: Samarasinghe
	
Northern Province Chief Minister C. V Wigneswarans moves to establish a hybrid court in the province is a dream which will never materialize, Skills Development and Vocational Training Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe said.

Speaking at an Independence Day ceremony in Kalutara, the minister went on to say that some politicians had become slaves to foreign powers and organizations and were only working towards obtaining certain privileges.

We will not betray our soldiers and police officers. I saw a news report which said a hybrid court will be established in the Northern Provincial Council. I want to say that this is just a dream of the Chief Minister which will not be accomplished. We have faith that President Maithripala Sirisena would not allow anyone to betray our soldiers, he said.(Darshana Sanjeewa)
