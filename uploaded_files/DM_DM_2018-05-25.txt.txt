A foretaste of what is to come
	

Given several polls round the corner, this senior Green party purohita recently visited his electorate to say howdy to his voters, but he got an unexpected hostile reception from them, they say.

On hearing that the purohita was on his way to the home turf to meet them, a sizable crowd had gathered to meet him.
Highly elated on seeing the large gathering, the purohita all smiles greeted them and told them. I know you all are facing lots of problems like the high living costs these days. But I know you are all with me and I am always with you!
However, it was derisive laughter that greeted his statement.
We know that voting for you is not the answer to our problems, said one man in the gathering.
Your sweet words dont fill our empty stomachs, another man said.
Taken aback by this unexpected reaction, the purohita said: I too am very unhappy that prices of essentials are going up. But I am quite helpless, the senior purohita said. And this reply drew a chorus of angry epithets from the crowd.
Finding that the crowd was getting increasingly restive, the purohita turned back for home without further ado, abandoning the painstakingly planned days programme in the electorate, they say.

Abolishing executive presidency: Prez, PM must state their stance: JVP
	
Chief Opposition Whip and JVP Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake said today President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe reveal their stance on the 20th Amendment on abolishing presidential powers because they had given such a pledge to people.
He said this after handing over the amendment to the Parliament Secretary General last morning.
The President became the common candidate at the 2015 presidential election on the promise of scrapping the executive presidency. Soon after the swearing-in ceremony he said the 2015 presidential election would be the last such election in the country. He also repeated his pledge to scrap the executive presidency at the funeral of the Ven Maduluwawe Sobitha Thera who was a staunch supporter of scrapping the executive presidency. Therefore, he cannot run away from the pledge he made and the mandate he received in 2015, the MP said.
He said the same applied to the Prime Minister as well who had also pledged to scrap it. The UNP has passed two resolutions at two of its party conventions. Therefore he too cannot work against the mandate he had received. The Premier cannot change his stance whenever his fortunes in politics change, the MP said.
He said former President Mahinda Rajapaksa should urge the government to scrap the presidency, as he has made his stance clear. The JVP leader said his party was willing to discuss the scrapping of the presidency with all political parties. However we do not intend to discuss this with those keen on worshiping the executive president, he said. (Yohan Perera and Ajith Siriwardana)

## Title: Ayurvedic method  of curing headaches
## Section: Medicine

Ayurvedic method  of curing headaches
	

Headaches are one of the most common medical complaints. It would be difficult to find someone who has never had a headache. 
Headaches should be taken good care of because it might be the sign of a serious underlying issue. This is of course if headaches are frequent. says Ayurvedic Physician Ranjith Abeywardena, the former Ayurvedic Instructor attached to the Ministry of Tourism and Sri Lanka Tourism Promotion Bureau. 
A headache can occur in any part of the head, in both sides or in just one area or all around the head. Reasons are many for a headache. It usually doesnt represent one disease, but most probably a pre-symptom of another disease, such as catarrh, migraine, high blood pressure, excessive tiredness, anger, depression, as well as side effects of some medicines, weakness of the eye (constant staring at an object like computer screen), weaknesses of nerves, problems in blood vessels in brain, brain tumor, brain cancer or infections in the ear. High levels of phlegm stored and blocking cavities in the cranium is also responsible for headaches. The patient must know the rhythm, time and should pay close attention to constant severe headaches. When the simple home remedies fail to control a headache one must seek medical assistance. 

Home remedies
Medicinal steam to ease the pain. Boil Nika leaves, Paavatta leaves, Beli and Dehi (lime) leaves together. It is fine to use one or two ingredients if it is difficult to find all four ingredients. When the hot steam emanates, keep it on the floor and get ready to steam. Your chest and head should be well exposed to this steam. Therefore, sit close to the steaming pot and breathe well, covering yourself with a blanket. Breathe in with the nose and breathe out through the mouth. Breathe deeply. The medicinal combinations of these leaves and the hot steam reduces the pain and relaxes the head. Stored phlegm in your body is also loosened, helping to clear it out easily. 
Ayurvedic concoctions should be taken for constant headaches, by visiting an Ayurvedic doctor. Some patients do make medicines without consulting a doctor. 
 Boil raw ginger and coriander adding eight cups of water. Boil until the water reduces to one cup. Drink half a cup and keep the other half to be consumed later. These medicines are usually taken in the morning, and night. If the first half cup is consumed in the morning, the other half is to be taken at night. If the first one is taken at night, the rest is taken the next morning. 
	Using raw ginger will loosen phlegm while dry ginger will dry it up. It is not advisable to use dry ginger when suffering from coughs. 
	Take Beli roots, Babila roots and dry ginger in equal amounts {four kalan (a measuring unit of Ayurveda) 20g of each ingredient  total 12 kalan}, boil adding eight cups of water. Wait until it reduces to one cup, and have it as described above. But add some rock salt (Sahinda lunu) into it before drinking. This medicine will quickly cure the severe headache. 
	Boil and drink the five ingredients packet (Pas panguwa) or the ten ingredients (dasa panguwa)available in Ayurvedic Medicinal shops and retail shops. Choose a trustworthy shop and a brand since there are many low quality Pas panguwa packets. 
Commenting on the pain killers used in Ayurveda, the doctor said, Yes there are pain killers in Ayurveda, but due to lack of ingredients available, it is not produced. The permits are required to make those medicines, called Rasa medicines. The making of 90% of these medicines has been stopped. 
We usually do not give priority to pain killers since we treat the root cause of a disease, in Ayurveda. Inhaling medicinal powders and oils are done to relieve headaches with the guidance of an Ayurvedic doctor. Head massages also play an important part in relieving headaches. Pouring oil on the head is yet another method of massage which is known as Shirodhara. The medicines used in Ayurveda are 100% natural and free of side effects. The present society does not pay attention to curing a disease for life and enjoy good health, but opt for quick treatments without considering Ayurveda; largely because of the long process of making Ayurvedic medicine, or high costs. By opting for quick treatment the disease worsens in the long-term, he said. 

Avoid these foods
Frozen food, refrigerated food and drinks
	Processed food (such food produce acids in digestion and disturbs the effects of medicine) 
	If the headache is caused by phlegm, avoid eggs, curd, ice creams and other refrigerated food. 
	Do not bathe daily; twice during the week is sufficient for patients with phlegm. Avoid evening or night showers.
	Do not bathe after a long sleepless night. 
	Drink warm water as much as possible. 
	Massage head with a warm water soaked cloth. 

If someone is experiencing frequent headaches and has high blood pressure in the family, and is also suffering from some serious diseases, pay close attention to such headaches. Many headaches can be a sign of an underlying disease in such cases, the doctor concluded.

Chained toilet mugs to fans: Things Indian Rail passengers steal
	

Hindustan Times, New Delhi, 24 mAY, 2018 - From toilet mugs to ceiling fans, bed linen to blankets, little thats of value escapes the attention of thieves on Indian Railways. Such items, together with showers in washrooms, iron grills of windows, even railway tracks, were among stolen property worth Rs. 2.97 crore recovered by the Railway Protection Force (RPF) in 2017-18.
That was double the value of stolen item recovered by the RPF in the previous year.
We have sometimes noticed passengers stuffing linen in their bag while deboarding the train. Theft of mugs and other iron material is common by drug addicts who later sell them... main concern is theft of track materials, which can lead to accidents, said an officer of the RPF, empowered to deal with theft under the Railways Act. In 2016-17, the RPF arrested 5,458 people in 5,219 cases of theft while recovering property worth Rs. 1.58 crore. The number of cases increased to 5,239 in 2017-18. staff shortage is said to impede the forces ability to conduct anti-theft drives on a regular basis.

Commemoration does not (necessarily) exclude celebration
	

	The more we and our politicians dawdle, the closer we get to the repetition of that same history
	
	
	We cannot just ignore that reality and say, They are commemorating murderers and we are commemorating the murdered!
	
	
	MR forgot one salient detail: that celebration, while permissible, does not entail colourful pageants the likes of which might have been conceived in the mind of Jean-Bdel Bokassa
	
Why is today so special the driver of the van I was in asked me, and I was stumped. A second later I checked myself; Sri Lankans seem to forget so easily that forgetting the commemoration of the (military) end of the civil war seems a trivial omission in comparison -- after all we have representatives of popular culture who dont even know when we got independence. Moreover, we were caught in a deluge, and the entirety of that day, last Friday, we were assailed with one rainstorm after another. It seemed to depress the significance of May the 18th, until I realised that nine years ago, the day that Velupillai Prabhakaran was killed and Sri Lankans went out to the streets in joy was also a day in which the rains fell down
as ferociously.
I remember much less than my parents do about the war. My parents remember much less than their parents do about the prelude to that war. History is cruel, unforgiving. It transforms the unity and the dynamism of one epoch to the shedding of blood of another. It records grievances and never lets them go. The end of the war in military terms, hence, was never going to be the end of the war in total. History is unyielding, compelling us to return to what we forewent on and pleading with us to do something, anything, to address those aforementioned grievances and the ruptures they cause. The more we and our politicians dawdle, the closer we get to the repetition of that same history. I was born to a twilight generation, which saw the conflict in full sway and its cessation also in full sway. I know what it is like to return. I do not want to return.
I remember a rather privileged childhood spent in the outskirts of Colombo and I remember going to school and coming back not knowing the dread my parents felt, or the doubts they entertained about seeing us return at all. Bomb squads, ambulance sirens, road enclosures, and the occasional yell by a random bystander: if this were the culture we of Colombo and its suburbs felt, imagine the fear of those who courted that culture as an everyday reality, in the maayim gammana of the Wanniya beyond Medavachchiya (the same Medavachchiya which, if I remember correctly, a politician from the then opposition cruelly and unnecessarily conflated with Kilinochchi in that supposedly most hallowed of all political grounds, the Parliament). Imagine how afraid they would be if rumours of a return to the pre-2009 situation become a reality. Imagine how frustrated they would be if those fears remain unaddressed.

"Commemoration means committing what one lost to memory, be it the 7,000 people the former government stated we lost at the final stages of the war or the 60,000+ people we all know we lost to the scourges of terrorism during the last 25 years"
Those who dream of fragmenting this already-fragmented nation, particularly those who call for independent homelands based on ethnic and religious backgrounds, and those who deny the right to commemorate, to reflect on, and to remember, with an admixture of joy and sadness, the significance of May the 18th, are those who flirted with the idea of fear in those blighted days. They are the people who sold peace and purchased war. They are the people who have lost their moral right to have a say in anything about the war after its cessation, if at all because they did everything in their power, and the power of whatever Dollars and Euros and Pounds they could get their hands on through their efforts to stall the path towards a definite military end to the conflict. For the truth of the matter is, our leaders (and there were a great many of them since that conflict officially erupted in 1983) had the greatest possible chance to bring together global efforts against terrorism and our need to end such terrorism on our own shores, once the West went through 9/11 and the War Against Terror it necessitated. Instead what did they do They went around the capitals of the world, waltzed with leaders of the global community, and contended that we needed to talk to those terrorists. In the end, the global community didnt talk. We did. They bombed.
Moving on. Commemoration does not unconditionally entail celebration, but it doesnt exclude it either. Commemoration means committing what one lost to memory, be it the 7,000 people the former government stated we lost at the final stages of the war or the 60,000+ people we all know we lost to the scourges of terrorism during the last 25 years. This begs the question, what is the figure we should account for Does it include the 100,000 killed during the JVP insurrection, which in case you forgot was accelerated by the opposition to the dictated-from-above 1987 Peace Accord with India Does it include the loss of human resources and brain drain the conflict compelled The international community will have their say and highlight aparticular statistic.
They will concentrate on what they want to concentrate on. But what of the other figures, ignored by those who have an axe to grind with the fact that we didnt go through their process of approval when expediting the end of the conflict Dont all wars end in bloodshed, and if they do, how was this war any different These are questions we ask, from completely different political camps.
Rajitha Senaratne, a politician I disagree with vehemently on almost every issue conceivable, finally said something I could agree with the other day. They were dear to them just as our people are dear to us was the gist of his argument when justifying his conciliatory attitude to the politicians of the North choosing to commemorate May 18 as a Heroes Day. True. In that sense Mahinda Rajapaksa, Gotabaya Rajapaksa, Sarath Fonseka, Kamal Gunaratne, and the other chief architects of the end of the civil war are as dear to the Sinhala people as the former deceased members of the LTTE are to the people of the North.
We cannot just ignore that reality and say, They are commemorating murderers and we are commemorating the murdered! Such simplistic dichotomies conceal one pertinent truth: those members were forced to believe in a cause higher than themselves.

"It seemed to depress the significance of May the 18th, until I realised that nine years ago, the day that Velupillai Prabhakaran was killed and Sri Lankans went out to the streets in joy was also a day in which the rains fell down as ferociously"
It didnt matter to Prabhakaran whether they believed it willingly or not. Every Sinhala mother, father, and child and Muslim mother, father, and child they killed were killed out of an overwhelming fanaticism.
Mahinda Rajapaksa, who gave leadership to the war, forgot one salient detail: that celebration, while permissible, does not entail colourful pageants the likes of which might have been conceived in the mind of Jean-Bdel Bokassa (go ahead, Google him) decades ago. Such crudeness was of course permissible because a vast majority of the country happened to hail from the demographic who wanted to celebrate.
It was only later, after he and his brothers fell from grace, that they decided to reflect, rather than decorate (May 18 of 2015, if I remember correctly, was commemorated as a quiet, reserved ceremony at the Vihara Maha Devi Park). But it was too little, too late. Such a ceremony was needed earlier. Much, much earlier. And now, with all the racist invectives and outbursts erupting every month or so, we need it more than ever before. Without, however, erasing or banishing the possibility of celebration altogether.
Kamal Gunaratne, remembering his schoolboy days in the first chapter of his Road to Nandikadal (a book we should all read), reflects on a set of verses and lines from a song we dont get to hear that often on radio today: Abeywardena Balasooriyas Awasan Husma. The song, a deshabimana gee, begins with these plaintive lines:
Gunaratne remembers the sense of pride, of sadness, of joy, that it compelled in him. That sense of pride and sadness and joy, for me, comes out from the next set of lines:
In short, what does the king and the emperor, what does the fool, the unpatriotic, the idle, know about the sweat and the toil of winning a hard-won peace It is the question May the 18th compels from us every day. And I think it is also the question which we should all ponder on the moment a debate about whether to commemorate or celebrate that day crops up.
Once we realise we have no real moral right to fight over such debates, once we realise that those who laid down their lives for us did not lay them down so that we could fight over such petty issues, we will understand. And fully.

Drunk businessman who became amorous with air hostess arrested
	
An intoxicated businessman who was in Business Class onboard a Sri Lankan flight returning from Dubai to Colombo had allegedly tried to molest an Air Hostess on the flight. He was taken into custody by the Airport Police, the police headquarters revealed.
The suspect has been identified as 49-year-old businessman who is a resident of
Mount Lavinia.
Police sources revealed that the suspect had initially requested for high priced liquor and an argument had arisen between him and the air hostess from whom he requested the liquor. He had used abusive language on her causing her to ask another air hostess to handle the passenger.
When the 'replacement' air hostess brought him the foreign liquor that he wanted he had attempted to get amorous with her after pulling her by her by the hand.
She had managed to break free from his hold and had then complained to the security officers who had arrested him and handed the drunk businessman over to the Airport Police on arrival. (Indika Ramanayake)

Floods, preserve wetlands, restore wewas - EDITORIAL
	
With about 120,000 people seriously affected by the ongoing floods and landslides, the Disaster Management Centre (DMC) and other State institutions say they are providing the relief measures needed by the victims while full-scale rescue operations are taking place with the assistance of some 600 police personnel and troops. They say more than 5,000 security forces personnel are standing by for action if the situation gets worse.
While relief and rescue operations are commendable, the national government is also implementing long-term measures to curb the drastic effects of both the Southwest and Northeast Monsoons. No doubt environmental pollution and global warming aggravate floods, droughts and similar crises, but the situation is made worse by human misadventures such as the large-scale takeover of wetlands in cities and urban areas.

According to a World Bank (WB) report last month, built on a low-lying river estuary overlooking the sea, Colombo is highly vulnerable to flooding. The flood risk in the Sri Lankan capital is being exacerbated by rapid economic growth and investments from the public and private sectors. This has led to rapid and haphazard land use and reclamation of the citys rare natural urban wetlands which function as flood retention areas.
The WB says that in 2010, two major rainfall events flooded Colombo, demonstrating the realities of high flood risk in the Colombo metropolitan region. The massive flooding shut down Colombo for almost a week, affecting about 50% of the private sector in the city. 
Over the past three decades, Colombo has seen a marked increase in its annual average rainfall. This may indicate that floods of this scale will happen with increasing frequency in the future, as we see what is happening today. If climate change is taken into account, the severity of extreme events is expected to be even higher. Substantial flooding most recently occurred last year.
Proposing a comprehensive urban wetlands management plan, the WB says that to address these challenges, the government carried out a post-disaster needs assessment supported by the Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery (GFDRR). It also set up a state-of-the-art hydraulic model for the Colombo drainage catchment, piloted the Robust Decision Making methodology, and carried out a comprehensive analysis of rainfall and flood patterns for the past 25 years.
The hydraulic model findings have demonstrated the critical role wetlands play in flood regulation within Colombo, providing refuge for 39% of the flood waters during a storm event. The WB report is a staggering reminder that marshlands, wetlands or green areas play a vital role in the life or death battle against global warming though the United States unpredictable and dangerously-inconsistent President Donald Trump continues to maintain his foolhardy concept that global warming is largely a hoax made in China.

"By highlighting the criticality of the role of urban wetlands in reducing flood risk, these initiatives help create the impetus for the governments development of a comprehensive strategy for urban wetlands management"
By highlighting the criticality of the role of urban wetlands in reducing flood risk, these initiatives help create the impetus for the governments development of a comprehensive strategy for urban wetlands management. Leveraging nature-based solutions for flood risk management, this strategy includes protecting and managing the existing retention capacity of the basin that comes from a network of natural and man-made wetlands. As part of the Colombo Megapolis Development Plan, there are preparatory efforts underway to strategically map Colombos urban wetlands as green areas, preserving the wetlands natural character and co-benefits to the city.
The WB says the government is also tapping the recreation potential of the wetlands through the establishment of two urban wetland parks with information centres and nature viewing facilities. A third centre for wetland discovery for children is also being planned. If their recreation potential is maximized, the wetlands could generate about $13 million in revenue for Colombo, a further impetus for their long-term preservation. Formulating legal protection and inter-agency coordination for the urban wetland complex to ensure its preservation could ultimately avoid high flood risk scenarios in which the country could lose 1% of GDP on average every year due to floods, the report adds.
In addition, though the WB may not know much about this, the government needs to expedite measures to restore more than 10,000 wewas which were marvels of our ancient engineering and civilization. This was the concept of King Parakramabahu who said that not a single drop of rain should be allowed to go waste without being used for human development. We hope that by wetland preservation and reservation of wewas, heavy floods in the future could be turned from a disaster to a blessing.

While admitting that he did receive a Rs. 1 million cheque from Walt and Row Associates for election campaign in 2015, former Minister SLFP MP Dayasiri Jayasekara today said he was neither an MP nor a member of the COPE, when he received it for election funding.
He told Parliament that it was a cash cheque and added that he could not remember whether it had been signed by Perpetual Treasuries Ltd. owner Arjun Aloysius.
"It was a cash cheque and was not addressed to me. I can't remember whether it had been signed by Aloysius and who encashed it. Someone must have encashed it and used for my election campaign," he said.
He said it was a normal practice in Sri Lankan politics for businessmen to support election campaign of not only Parliamentarians but also of Provincial Councillors and Pradeshiya Sabha Members.
"As I have said earlier I had close business relationship with Arjun Aloysius. When the said cheque, dated July, 13 in 2015 was given to me, I was campaigning for the General Election after functioning as the Chief Minister in the North Western Province," he said.
The MP said he never acted to protect Arjun Aloysius in the COPE by obtaining money adding that he would never do so in the future.
"There are many persons who had obtained money from Aloysius. If the other 3,000 pages of the Presidential Commission of Inquiry into the bond scam were presented in Parliament, those names would also be revealed," he said.
He said the Government had resorted to a witch-hunt of the SLFP MPs who came out of the Government.
"The Government is slinging mud at us. A case has been filed against former Minister T.B. Ekanayake," he said. (Ajith Siriwardana and Yohan Perera)

Is poor anger control an illness 
	

Anger has become a very common problem in the modern world giving rise to various undesirable consequences. Anger is an emotion. The Oxford Dictionary defines anger as a strong feeling of annoyance. Anger gives rise to psychological and biochemical changes within you. This weeks edition of Health Capsule got Dr. Kosala Amaranayake, MBBS, MD (Psych), who is a Lecturer at the Department of Psychiatry, Faculty of Medicine, University of Peradeniya and Honorary Consultant Psychiatrist at the Teaching Hospital, Peradeniya to speak about anger.  
Anger can be present without a detectable psychiatric illness. However it can be a symptom of a psychiatric illness as well. Anger gives rise to many complications. These complications are physical as well as psychological. Scientists have found that when you are angry there is a set of chemicals produced within the body system that can affect your health badly. Cortisol, adrenalin and noradrenalin are among them. These chemicals give rise to changes in the biochemical functions of the body, eventually giving rise to changes in your body and mind. Hypertension is common among people who get angry easily, which is one of the physical complications of this condition.

The ability to think ahead plus attention and concentration are lost when you are angry. You tend to have tunnel thinking, meaning that you are unable to consider various aspects of a problem when you take a particular decision. As a result you tend to take very poor decisions.

Domestic violence is one of the main problems of poor anger control. Misunderstandings and mistakes are common in married life. However a person who is having poor anger control does not handle his or her problems well. This gives rise to psychological problems in the person who is being abused. Depression is common among them. There are instances when domestic violence gives rise to death of the partner. Other problems related to poor anger control are road rage and road accidents. Many lives could be saved if anger is controlled. 

Psychiatric illnesses
Depression is among the commonest that give rise to poor anger control. Irritability is considered as one of the commonest symptoms of depression. Particularly in children irritability and poor anger control are common symptoms. Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is an unrecognized cause of poor anger control. Patients with OCD are obsessed with symmetry and orderliness and whenever things are not in order they become irritable and angry. Other psychiatric illnesses like anxiety disorders, psychotic disorders and even sexual disorders can give rise to poor anger control. In the latest classifications of psychiatric diseases there is a separate entity called impulse control disorders where poor anger control is a predominant symptom without symptoms of other psychiatric illnesses. Substance use disorders are also common among psychiatric illnesses giving rise to poor anger control. Some drugs in their intoxication (when you consume the drug) gives rise to poor anger control. In some when they are withdrawing (not taking the drug) from the drugs, they experience poor anger control. People who have particular personalities are more vulnerable to poor anger control. They are anti-social personality, borderline personality and anankastic personality(obsessional personality). The personality disorder is also an unrecognized cause of poor anger control. A patient with a borderline personality disorder is impulsive and wants to release his or her emotions in a low level of threshold. Further they release their emotions without the concern of the future consequences. Borderline personality disorders are commoner among females compared to males. 

What you should do
As discussed early, poor anger control can give rise to various undesirable consequences, if unaddressed. It is important to detect and address it early. Hence it is always better to obtain the opinion of a psychiatrist if you have poor anger control. First it is important to exclude any treatable psychiatric illnesses, which gives rise to poor anger control. If any psychiatric illness is identified it should be treated accordingly. Commencement of antidepressants for a depressive disorder, anti psychotic for a psychotic disorder and treating substance dependence are examples of treating a psychiatric illness. Psychotherapies (commonly known as talking therapy) are also being used in treating these psychiatric illnesses. If there is no treatable psychiatric illness identified, anger management strategies will be applicable. 

Vital tips
It is important first to acknowledge that you have a problem with anger control and recognise your anger signs. When you identify that you have a problem with managing anger, maintain a log of situations of poor anger control, which gives an insight into situations, precipitating factors and consequences of your anger. When you are about to show anger you will feel the physical symptoms. When anger is present the heart beats faster and you breathe quickly. You might also notice other signs, such as tension in your shoulders or the clenching of your fists. These are signs of loosing control. If you notice these signs get out of the situation so that you can prevent disastrous consequences. If you take time and calm yourself down it will take away the complications of anger. Counting to 10 gives you time to cool down. This helps you think clearly and overcome the impulse to lash out. Breathing exercises have proved helpful in controlling anger. However it is important that you practice beforehand what you would apply when you are angry. Breath in the maximum you can and breathe out one third of it and keep the rest until you find you are uneasy. Exhale the rest on two occasions. This practice also gives rise to a physical reaction around your lungs as well as giving a psychological rest to your mind. Bringing down your general stress also helps anger control. Looking after yourself, having a timetable for your life and planning ahead will reduce your general stress level. Create time to relax regularly and ensure that you get enough sleep. There is a misconception among the general public that drugs and alcohol can reduce your stress levels. However drugs and alcohol can worsen anger problems. Therefore it is important to refrain from drugs and alcohol especially when you have anger control issues. Also bring down your general stress levels with exercise and relaxation with activities like running, walking, swimming, yoga and meditation. At the same time creative activities like writing, making music, dancing or painting can release tension and reduce feelings of anger. Moreover it is important to have a supporting network, thus discussing your feelings with a friend can be useful and can help you get a different perspective of the situation. Miscommunication contributes to frustrating situations. The better your listening skills, the easier it is to find a resolution that does not involve an angry response. Assertiveness is also important during anger control. When you are assertive you focus on balance and you are honest about what you want and respect the needs of others. 
Anger is common. There are many reasons behind anger and it can give rise to disastrous consequences. It is important to identify your anger, control it and seek help of an expert.

Meeting with Kim Jong-un could still happen: Trump
	
US President Donald Trump has said his summit with North Korea's leader Kim Jong-un could still happen on June 12, despite earlier cancelling the meeting, the BBC today reported.
"We'll see what happens. It could even be the 12th. We're talking to them now. They very much want to do it, we'd like to do it," he told reporters.
On Thursday, he blamed the North's "open hostility" for the cancellation of his talks with Kim Jong-un.
North Korea later said it was willing to talk "at any time in any form".
Vice-Foreign Minister Kim Kye-gwan said Mr Trump's cancellation decision was "extremely regrettable".
The 12 June summit in Singapore would have been the first time a sitting US president had met a North Korean leader.
The details of the now scrapped talks were unclear. But they would have focused on ways of denuclearising the Korean peninsula and reducing tensions.

Parliament set to debate reforms of the House of Lords
	

UK, (Daily Mail), 24 May 2018 - Parliament is to debate sweeping reforms of the House of Lords next month amid rising concern that peers have overstepped the mark in their opposition to Brexit. MPs will hold the debate after a petition calling for the abolition of the Upper Chamber attracted more than 166,000 signatures. 
Calls for reform intensified yesterday after the Daily Mail published polling showing 76 percent of voters believed peers were out of tune with the will of the British people. Five in six voters said they wanted to see the Lords reformed. In response, Downing Street last night warned the Lords it would not accept attempts by peers to thwart Brexit. The Prime Ministers spokesman said that some of the 15 Lords amendments to the EU Withdrawal Bill had been unacceptable. He added: The Government is delivering on the decision made by the country in the referendum to leave the EU and will not accept attempts to stop this. 
Labour leader Corbyn went further, pledging to replace the Lords with an elected second chamber.

## Title: Politicking rain and thunder
## Section: Opinion

Politicking rain and thunder
	
	Floods, landslides should not be publicity stunts for Governments
	
	
	People need to come out of this regular tragedy, without allowing Governments and politicians to play around with human life.
	

Thus far, according to the Meteorology Department, 18 out of the 25 Districts of the country were badly affected by the rains.
The NBRO said nine Districts had extended warnings of landslides and warning on floods in areas downstream Kelani, Kalu, Gin, Nilwala, and Mahaweli Rivers and also Maha and Attanagalu Oya.
People in those areas have been asked to evacuate at the time of writing this brief on Wednesday (23 May) evening.
At least 11 people have lost their lives, while over 105,300 people have been affected in 18 Districts. Perhaps the numbers would increase during the next 24 hours, but the situation may subside by the time this appears on Friday and there will be wrapping up work left for politicians to gain some media coverage.
The easiest and most convenient statement for the Government is to dismiss all such disasters as natural.
President Sirisena was reported as saying, rains were needed as seasonal cultivation was badly affected from long drought in most agricultural areas, but it so happens, heavy rains bring disaster too for people.
Uncontrollable rains across the country lead to landslides and floods is what we are therefore made to believe and continue to believe.
This Government, no different to the past Government sits comfortably on such social perceptions that instantly jerk society to rush with food, clothing and support for evacuation.
As with any issue that demands immediate State intervention, the President made a public announcement, that he had ordered authorities to take immediate steps to provide necessary relief to the flood-affected.

	Can all these disasters that took the life during four years after Meeriyabedda, be simply ruled as natural
	
	
	Should they be allowed to go with an inefficient State administration that cannot deliver emergency relief 
	
	
	Landslides and floods experienced in the past few years were not natural, as they carried with them the ferocity of all the blunders and neglect in governance
	
The Prime Minister too got his Ministers to move quickly on relief work. People are expected to believe they are busy getting everything in order.
Some electronic media crudely exploit this emotional jerk in society to project themselves as saviours of the affected poor at the expense of charitable souls.
There are also CSR projects launched by the Corporate Sector, again at the expense of emotional people. Are these disasters that natural to go with such hyped drama almost every year
With every such disaster, relevant State organisations keep issuing warnings to people. No doubt they are necessary and should come as well disseminated early enough warnings. What nevertheless needs to be asked is how valid are these early warnings issued by the NBRO and the DMC in a context of regular disasters

"This major disaster is due to unplanned exploitation of land and natural resources over many decades under every government that totally neglected environmental factors and safety of life in lieu of economic advantage"

Their relevance and validity were no different from now when the major landslide that washed off 150 houses and left a conflicting number of deaths and missing, on October 29, 2014, in Koslanda, Meeriyabedda.
The NBRO claimed it issued an early warning the previous day, but the DMC had failed to deliver it to authorities in Badulla. The Disaster Management Center (DMC) denied it saying the people had no time to leave.
Responding to that, the then Minister of Disaster Management, who is presently the Minister of Agriculture told media, people were warned to leave the place twice due to landslide risks; once in 2005 and again in 2012. Close to two years after the Meeriyabedda disaster and exactly two years ago in May 2016 cames the Aranayake disaster that accounted for 127 deaths.
Again, there were early warnings, but not for Aranayake in Kegalle District. It was said, Colombo, Gampaha and Puttalam were worst affected from floods, while Ratnapura and Kegalle were affected by landslides.
Thereafter the collapse of the Meethotamulla garbage mountain after heavy rains in April 2017, was followed by heavy floods in Colombo and Gampaha in May 2017.
These areas that went under six feet of water are called low lying and hence accepted as prone to flooding.
Can all these massive disasters that took life in hundreds and left thousands of people destitute during four years after Meeriyabedda, be simply ruled as natural

"These people who were seriously affected were all plantation sector workers and poor rural people, whose economic and social life is tied to areas where they live and have been living for many generations"

Should they be allowed to go with an inefficient State administration that cannot deliver emergency relief that is prompt and quick enough and compensation thereafter for rebuilding the life that gets entrenched in political rhetoric
Should they be left aside after compensation that came belatedly, without due research into possible future disasters and answers to minimise damage to life and property
After the Meeriyabedda and then Aranayake disasters, the FTZ and General Services Employees Union made a public statement that said, there was no rational and no permanent answer in asking the people to evacuate with every landslide warning.
They said these people who were seriously affected were all plantation sector workers and poor rural people, whose economic and social life was tied to areas where they lived and have been living for many generations. Made to carry a heavily burdened life, these people cannot be asked to move out on their own, the FTZ union said.
They have to be supported in housing, their children need schools and health facilities as basic needs, said the FTZ union stressing and emphasising there has to be serious planning by the Government and State agencies to relocate all people who are recognised as living in disaster-prone areas before another landslide leaves people dead and desolate.
Another collective of social interest activists initiated by me as DecentLanka2015 also made a public appeal on 22 May 2016, echoing similar sentiments.
This statement very clearly said landslides and floods experienced in the past few years were not natural, as they carried with them the ferocity of all the blunders and neglect in governance over decades.
This major disaster is due to unplanned exploitation of land and natural resources over many decades under every Government that totally neglected environmental factors and safety of life in lieu of economic advantage, it said in bold letters.
After that very strong and serious statement in May 2016, to have two disasters in April and May 2017, followed by another exactly two years later in this month, proves how insensitive and irresponsible the State and the political establishment are, in planning and implementing solutions to issues that are all about life and death of people.
Thus, it is now important to reproduce relevant parts of that statement.
Once again, no different to all previous Governments, this Government and the authorities want people to be more vigilant over possible disasters, leaving all these tragedies as wholly natural. No responsibility is thus taken for the safe and secure living of people living in threatened areas.
This is not what is expected from a responsible Government. Every single citizen (including those whose lives are devastated) is being taxed direct and indirect for work the Government has to plan and implement for the benefit of the people. The National Building and Research Organisation (NBRO), the Disaster Management Centre (DMC) and other line agencies are paid by peoples tax money for their work. All the monies spent on collecting data and mapping of dangerous zones are meant to be used for the benefit of the people and not for mere early warnings on landslides
We are very firm that the Government should stop playing with innocent lives. ...It is the responsibility of the Government to provide these people with decent locations out of danger and with adequate opportunities for livelihood. Thats what the NBRO maps should be for.
What is more important, are the demands listed in this statement that go parallel to what the FTZ union too wanted the Government to immediately implement, but have not been even looked at. They are:-
1. Immediately appoint a high powered committee of professionals with social acceptance specialised in geology, water management, environment, etc. to study and furnish recommendations for sustainable solutions within 06 months
2. Committee recommendations to be used through a consultative process in drawing up a holistic relocation programme for all people identified as living in danger zones prone to landslides.
3. The Megapolis Programme to be redesigned to include flood prevention plans for Colombo and Gampaha Districts that would serve peoples needs and provides safe alternatives to those living along the Kelani River.
4. Announce details of all local and foreign aid and donations received exclusively for flood and landslide relief work and how much compensation was given out in each Divisional Secretarial area.

"Should they be allowed to go with an inefficient State administration that cannot deliver emergency relief that is prompt and quick enough and compensation thereafter for rebuilding life that gets entrenched in political rhetoric"

This was what went missing after the 2004 December Tsunami, during the first year when Sri Lanka was inundated with foreign donor funds, expertise and volunteers that sucked up all local initiatives.
There were no holistic planning and no detailed accounting of what came and what went where. It has always been the case with every local disaster.
It is time, therefore, to demand serious and holistic planning with public consultations to make Central, Sabaragamuwa and Uva Provinces environmentally safe and human life secure in those provinces, for it is their disasters that get washed downstream regularly and drag the whole country into heavy annual floods and into long periods of drought.
We as people need to come out of this regular tragedy, without allowing Governments and politicians to play around with human life.

Remanding of JO MP unacceptable: Speaker
	
The remanding of joint opposition MP Sarath Nishantha is unacceptable and unreasonable, Speaker Karu Jayasuriya told Parliament today.
He said this when joint opposition MPs raised the matter in the House this morning.
JO parliamentary group leader Dinesh Gunawardene said nothing has been done about this even though his party had raised this matter thrice. We are highlighting this matter pertaining to Mr. Nishantha because it affects all members of Parliament."
The MP was arrested on a complaint made by the government with regard to the construction of a a Daham Pasala building in a temple.
The Speaker said he discussed this matter with the Justice Minister and the Attorney General and assured he would look into it again.
"I contacted Mr. Nishantha and inquired about his health. I informed the Justice Minister and she also said this was unreasonable. This incident has happened about four or five years ago. I do not accept this procedure. It is unreasonable," he said.
Mr. Gunawardene said the remanded MP had not been granted bail yesterday because the judge was absent.
MP Bandula Gunawardene said this government had gone down history for jailing the most number of members of Parliament.
MP Wimal Weerawansa said Mr. Nishantha has been held for violating bail conditions and the Court should finish up the matter in a reasonable manner, without keeping him in remand.

RIGHT OF REPLY: From Dominion Status to Sovereign  Sri Lanka
	
Mr. K.K.S. Pereras article headlined From Dominion Status to Sovereign Sri Lanka published on May 22 appears to contain an inaccurate statement regarding the provision relating to Buddhism in the 1972 Constitution. I refer in particular to the statement: In 1972, PM Sirimavo being mindful of Article 5 of the 1815 Kandyan Convention, had directed Dr. Colvin to provide the foremost place to Buddhism. In all the discussions I had with Mrs. Bandaranaike on matters relating to the proposed Constitution, she made no reference whatsoever to the Kandyan Convention. Nor did she do in the Committee of the Constituent Assembly that considered the issue of Buddhism, which included among its members both Dr. Colvin R. de Silva and Dudley Senanayake. The Kandyan Convention was invoked in that committee by the Mahanayake Theras of the Malwatta and Asgiriya Chapters, the Udarata Vihara Devala Bharakara Sangamaya, the Sasana Sevaka Society Limited, the Sinhala Prajatantravadi Sangamaya, and the Asoka Dharmadutha Sangamaya. Their submissions were rejected by the committee which incidentally was chaired by Mrs. Bandaranaike. 
Although the Common Programme and the United Front manifesto had both declared that, Buddhism, the religion of the majority, will be ensured its rightful place, the early drafts of the Basic Resolutions prepared in 1970 did not contain any reference to Buddhism. The only reference to religion was the fundamental right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion enjoyed by every citizen. In December 1970, the Premier drew the attention of the Constitutional Affairs Minister to the summary of representations received by his ministry from the public which indicated that there appears to be considerable demand in the country for Buddhism as a State religion and for the protection of its institutions and traditional places of worship. She suggested that some provision will have to be made in the new Constitution regarding these matters without, at the same time, derogating from the freedom of worship that should be guaranteed to all other religions. Accordingly, the following Basic Resolution was adopted by the Steering and Subjects Committee of the Constituent Assembly, and was later included in the draft Constitution as a single section Chapter II:

"Although the Common Programme and the United Front manifesto had both declared that, Buddhism, the religion of the majority, will be ensured its rightful place, the early drafts of the Basic Resolutions prepared in 1970 did not contain any reference to Buddhism"
3. In the Republic of Sri Lanka, the religion of the majority of the people, shall be given its rightful place, and accordingly, it shall be the duty of the State to protect and foster Buddhism, while assuring to all religions the rights granted by Basic Resolution
5 (iv).
The Committee of the Constituent Assembly that considered the chapter on Buddhism heard several delegations and considered hundreds of memoranda. While several lay organisations such as the All Ceylon Buddhist Congress, the Sasana Sevaka Society and the Maha Bodhi Society urged that Buddhism be declared the State religion, some of the monks who gave evidence appeared to be more concerned with the establishment of ownership of property required for the performance of rites and rituals. In fact, a senior prelate emphatically opposed the concept of a State religion. The committee rejected the proposal that Buddhism be declared the State religion, but recommended that the word rightful be replaced by foremost, the latter being the English translation of a Sinhala term that a large number of delegations favoured. This recommendation was accepted by the Constituent Assembly.
The Constitution accordingly provided in a one-section chapter that:
6. The Republic of Sri Lanka shall give to Buddhism the foremost place and accordingly it shall be the duty of the State to protect and foster Buddhism while assuring to all religions the rights granted by section 18 (1) (d).
This was an unusual provision in the Constitution of a multi-religious secular State. It was potentially very divisive, and identified those who professed their belief in the great religions such as Hinduism, Christianity and Islam as being the other in the Sri Lankan polity. Despite the declaration in Section 18 (1) (d) that every citizen shall have the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion, including the freedom to manifest his/her religion or belief in worship, observance, practice and teaching, it was inevitable that conflicts would occur as the State, and those claiming authority under the State, proceeded to protect and foster Buddhism and accord to it the foremost place, whatever these terms might mean in respect of what is essentially a philosophy of life.

Legal expert Dr Nihal Jayawickrama was a member of the Committee that drafted the 1972 Constitution of the Republic of Sri Lanka. He was the former Permanent Secretary to the Ministry of Justice (19701977) in the Srimavo Bandaranaike Government during which period the 1972 Constitution was prepared and implemented. At the age of 32 in 1970 he was appointed as the Attorney General. During his tenure as the Permanent Secretary to the Ministry of Justice, there were major developments in the Sri Lankan judiciary and these included the establishment of a new court structure and new civil, criminal and appellate procedures. He was a member of the Judicial Service Advisory Board, the Council of Legal Education, the Asian-African Legal Consultative Committee, New Delhi, and the Permanent Court of Arbitration at The Hague. He was a Representative to the United Nations General Assembly, and served as Adviser to the members of the Opposition on the Select Committee that drafted the1978 Constitution of Sri Lanka.

## Title: Sri Lankas critical care speciality  not evolving
## Section: News Features

Sri Lankas critical care speciality  not evolving
	

Medical specialities evolve for the benefit of patients. It resolves the demand and enhances clinical effectiveness.We are duty bound to support this evolution and create specialist services to serve the need.Quality healthcare is based on this concept and it is patient-centred, not provider centric. Accordingly, doctor training pathways need modification with relevant competencies to produce specialists with matching new skills.Such doctors are traditionally board certified as specialists via an exit examination (MD) to achieve a minimum national standard or benchmark. Today, board certification of critical care specialists in Sri Lanka has no exit examination, but is primarily testimonials based. This needs urgent redress. 
The impetus for the formation of a specialty board for critical care medicine in 2008 under the Board of Study for Multi-Disciplinary Study Courses of the Post Graduate Institute of Medicine (PGIM) was the plight of junior medical officers serving in intensive care units. The aim was to develop critical care medicine training with multi-disciplinary professional input. After much thought and discussion, a diploma critical care medicine curriculum (DCCM) was installed in 2009 based on the CoBaTrICE model (An International Competency Based Training programme in Intensive Care Medicine for Europe and other world regions) as a stepping stone for a higher degree in Critical Care i.e. MD. The DCCM training programme was of high intensity (60 credits) and matched level 10 of Sri Lanka Quality Framework (SLQF). A world renowned critical care specialist was present as an examiner. 
A standard and an alternate pathway for the transition period were proposed in 2011. This alternate pathway allowed anaesthetists practising critical care medicine to continue to do so and enter a trainee tailored training programme until the country produced a sufficient number of MD qualified critical care specialists via the standard pathway. This model was approved by the Senate of the University of Colombo. The purpose was to create an independent standard training programme for Critical Care Medicine and phase out the alternate pathway by 2016. 
In 2011, the College of Anesthesiologists took over the reins of this training programme virtually by force and the Board of Study in Anaesthesiology (BOS-A) saw its responsibilities being sanctioned for 1 year by the PGIM in the first instance. But they continued regardless. Sadly, for the past 8 years, no action has been taken to promote the standard pathway of training. The above diplomats were neither given an opportunity to take up appropriate leadership roles to shape up critical care services in Sri Lanka nor was a window opened for them for further training for MD. As a direct consequence, many of the diplomats migrated and became consultant critical care specialists elsewhere. The exodus was inevitable. The PGIM failed in its duties to the trainees and public alike. 
Scrapping of diploma programme
Instead of promoting this training program, the College of Anaesthetists decided to do away with the diploma programme by demoting its value and removed its foreign examiner. It decided to hold onto the alternate pathway of training as the final destination to critical care specialisation. Repeated requests by the Ministry of Health to install the standard training pathway fell on deaf ears. The Ministry of Health, the biggest employer of doctors in Sri Lanka, desperately wanted the above diplomats with intermediate training in Critical Care to maintain a credible intensive care service in its hospitals.
The lack of recognition of the problem and the inability to rectify the issues raised make the current specialty board in critical care medicine, hosted within the BOS-A, not fit for its purpose. If no action is taken, the DCCM would have no trainee applicants and specialty development of Critical Care Medicine in Sri Lanka will see a natural demise. In order to conceal this diverse interest, dual board certification in critical care medicine was offered to anesthetists. This self-served privilege was proposed, scrutinised and approved by the same board of study (BOS-A) constituted of only anesthetists. No exit examination on critical care medicine was necessary. 
In the PGIM, competence-based training pathways exist similar to DCCM. Ironically, anesthesia is one of them. In its training, the BOS-Ahas hosted a Part 1 A (a clinical practice-based examination) at the end of the 1st year of training followed by a Part 1 B, a theory test and the final Part 2 MD as its exit examination for decades. Thus,BOS-Ais fully aware of the need of basic clinical competence training for the junior members practicing anesthesia, but denies the same for critical care. Modern critical care is not a speciality that can be remotely managed from home or whilst engaged in another job in the operating theatre. The patient outcomes in critical care heavily depends on the presence of highly trained doctors and nurses on-site (24/7) and capable of recognising and rectifying deteriorating trends and mishaps long before irreversible damage is done. 
PGIM and evolving needs
Both critical care medicine and emergency medicine were recommended to be accepted as separate specialities in Sri Lanka by the then Minister of Health, the current President Maithripala Sirisena in 2011 following a review of its timely need. The University of Colombo hosts the only Institute of Post Graduate medical training in this country. Therefore, as a public funded organisation, the PGIM is obliged to shape up its training programs to serve the evolving needs of the Ministry of Health that serves all citizens of Sri Lanka. 
Every clinical specialty encounters disease conditions that would need intensive care. Therefore, every clinician has a right to participate in the care of their patients, in a critically ill state, to resolve therapies of the original illness. A majority of patients needing critical care services have coexisting medical and surgical problems. Thus, multi-disciplinary inputs are essential to direct training until critical care specialists are produced. 
Medicine evolves with time. When Hippocrates initiated medicine as a profession, there were no specialities. Specialities evolved to enhance care for patients and improve outcomes. Thus, the sole purpose of generation of specialities is natural, initially born as a sub-specialty of a parent specialty and then raised to become independent with time with greater experience in its development. For example, there were no paediatricians in 1970s, but they evolved from adult physicians. In 1990s it was clear that paediatricians could not offer the best services for neonates and hence neonatologists emerged. Although paediatricians were nurtured initially by the College of Physicians, they claim no ownership of paediatrics as a sub-specialty. A similar pathway of development will have to be followed for critical care medicine. 
The evolution of critical care medicine in the world began with the concentration of essential equipment and staff in one place of the hospital to serve the most sick patients; a concept first initiated by Florence Nightingale in 1850s. In 1950s with a polio epidemic in Denmark, mechanical ventilation was instituted and quite rightly anesthetists had a major role to play. However, with evolution of medicine it became clear that critical care needs new skills to improve the outcome of patients. 
The historical contribution by the College of Anaesthetists for the development of critical care medicine should be celebrated, as well as their continued involvement to produce trained future specialists in critical care. This is because some transferable skills of anaesthesia are needed for critical care specialist training. Critical Care specialists encompass other skills and competencies including the ability to lead a team of multi-professional doctors for the benefit of critically ill patients. Multi-organ failure resulting from dengue is one such example. Several recent media reports involving VIPs allude to the consequences of lack of team work. 
The very fact that the Sri Lanka College of Anaesthesiologists denial of the need for multi-professional input to critical care medicine development is testimony to its intentions to delay its progress to become an independent specialty in this country, but why It is also unfair that a junior doctor is expected to complete his training in anaesthetics as enforced by the BOS-A to be able to commence training in critical care. This is not dissimilar from demanding compulsory training to be a cricketer before becoming eligible to be a trainee rugby player just because cricketers training pathway had a transferable skill such as running. 
DCCM Examination
It is also surprising that PGIM has allowed board certification of a specialty for such a long time with no exit examination in its training pathway. The only credible critical care specialty-based examination held by the PGIM to date is the DCCM which is more comprehensive and detailed than any contained in anaesthesia prospectuses. In fact, the diploma holders have undergone the exact duration of critical care medicine training to that of post MD anaesthesia trainees who have become eligible for board certification in critical care without a single exit examination in critical care medicine. 
Critical Care Medicine already has established sub-specialities in cardiac, neuro, paediatric, renal and liver care in developed countries, and is usually primary disease oriented, and maintains inputs from primary referring specialists. A critical care specialist predominantly focuses on establishing (resuscitation) and maintaining adequate vital organ function by means of pharmacological, physiological, or artificial manipulation or replacement therapy. The primary aim of such stabilisation and maintenance of vital functions is to borrow time in life for natural healing process to take place assisted by the specific therapies instituted by relevant specialists until sustainable organ function has returned naturally or via artificial support of organs or following transplantation. 
In the UK, for example, intensive care medicine (ICM), now termed critical care medicine, achieved specialty status in 1999. In the early 1990s the foundation of the Faculty of Intensive Care Medicine was by seven parent colleges. This new faculty wasnt a destination, but was a starting point to establish Critical Care Medicine as a separate specialty. In 1992, the Royal Colleges in the UK formed the Joint Advisory Committee for Intensive Therapy and this became the Intercollegiate Board for Training in ICM in 1996. This was very similar to the establishment of a Specialty Board in Critical Care Medicine under the Board of Study for Multi-Disciplinary Study Courses in 2008 in Sri Lanka, but sadly moved away for sole management by BOS-A in 2011. This has effectively denounced the need for development of a multidisciplinary professional identity in critical care training in Sri Lanka. 
In January 2011, the General Medical Council (GMC) required Faculty of ICM-UK to develop a primary specialty training programme for ICM, a fact that the Sri Lankan College of Anaesthesiologists ignore to be in existence. Instead, the Sri Lanka College of Anaesthesiologists renamed themselves to include intensive care in 2014 without committing to the essential pillars needed for critical care medicine development. In contrast to the GMC, the Sri Lanka Medical Council remains silent. 
I hope wisdom will prevail in this ongoing saga. Its our responsibility to ensure that a safe, effective, efficient, well-led service is delivered to the public through the maintenance of the highest standards of training. Specialty formation should be to achieve the above for patients and not to retain territorial boundaries for provider gain. Moving the Speciality Board for Critical Care Medicine to be hosted under the Board of Study for Multi-Disciplinary Study Courses shall mark a new beginning.

The Forest and Lake by Schofieldshire
	
Nuwara Eliya, despite all the changes it has undergone over the years, remains the quintessential hill country retreat that the British envisaged over 150 years ago. While the masses flock to this scenic hideaway during April to seek refuge from the heat, crowding the streets and the few attractions it offers to the brim, Nuwara Eliya is a destination is best enjoyed at leisure, during the rest of the year; even during the rainy seasons.
The town itself is like many others, narrow roads packed with shops selling food, electronics, toys and even branded winter clothing at a steep discount from the high street retail prices.
Move away from the city and that is where its true beauty lies.
Perched on a hilltop off the road to Worlds End, is The Forest and Lake by Schofieldshire, a quaint little cottage style boutique villa that embodies the hill country experience in every sense of the word. The property sits between a stunning vista of a lake and a mountain range to one side and farms and quaint little colorful homes on the other.
The property itself keeps with the black and white exterior of old colonial buildings, with a twist of modernity. The Forest and Lake by Schofieldshire, has an immaculately landscaped garden space with flowering plants in bright hues dotting the garden. You walk inside to a completely different world than what you would expect, with plush carpeting, soft fabric finished Victorian style furniture and a reception featuring repurposed railway sleepers.
The owner of the property had a vision of creating a cozy, well-appointed space with a touch of modernity, that gives you the privacy and luxury of experiencing the beauty and wonder of Nuwara Eliya at your pace which has materialized into this beautiful property which is worth a visit. 
Find your own nook
A well-thought-out feature of the property are the cozy little nooks of seating spread throughout, each offering views of the wonderful vistas that surround you. Pick a place indoors or outdoors or even within some of the rooms itself, this is a fabulous way to curl up with a good book and hot cup of bright Nuwara Eliya tea.
Cozy up in the Coal Room
Arguably the best feature at The Forest and Lake by Schofieldshire, apart from the scenery that is, is the Coal Room. The dark hues of red fabric, repurposed wood, wrought iron and stone blend seamlessly with the floor level seating and the fireplace complete with a weather-beaten buffalo skull and horns hanging over the mantel piece. Pages of an old telephone book have been put to good use as wallpaper, giving this space a nice vintage charm. Wooden and wrought iron wheels are a key design feature that is hard to miss and bring an old western flair along with the skull and horns on the mantel. This room is always warm and cozy, even without the fire place being lit. Square-paned windows offer a glimpse of a lush landscaped garden past the veranda with its recliners and table for two.
Service with a smile
The amiable manager of the property, Tuan Amanulla is also the chef. His culinary versatility is such that he can create a good Sri Lankan rice and curry and a delicious pasta dish without a moments hesitation. The property has an a la carte menu featuring a wide range of dishes to choose from, ask him and he is sure to guide you through the best picks that suit your whim and fancy. If you are the outdoorsy kind and want to enjoy a chilly evening under the stars they also have a BBQ and fire pit set up. The Forest and Lake by Schofieldshire, is more than just luxury comfort. The property is planning to create an organic vegetable garden from where guests can pick their own vegetables and get them prepared by the chef according to their liking.
Rooms with a view
The 6 well-appointed rooms, each named after a tree from the forest nearby, has a personality of their own. These luxury rooms designed for different types of travelers including couples and families have one unmistakably attractive feature; breathtaking views of the forest and lake that surround the property which keep you mesmerized for hours on end. The rooms have all the basic comforts to keep you content, including tea and coffee making facilities, a TV, heater and some even feature a jacuzzi.
5 things to do when you book your stay at The Forest and Lake by Schofieldshire
Take a trip to Ambewela Farm. Even if you dont fancy a visit to the farm to see the pretty cows grazing in the meadow or cute little bunnies in shades of black, white, grey and brown, do it for the breathtaking scenery en-route.
Tip: Check on feeding times if you are visiting the farm. It is not as cute was feeding baby elephants, but its still fun and totally instagram worthy.
Pick strawberries on the way to Ambewela. There are quite a few strawberry farms along the way, including Jagro so dont forget to stop by to pick your self some juicy bright red strawberries to take home with you.
Take a trip to Worlds End. Not for away from the property, this gives you the perfect opportunity to take the journey of a life time.
You can also visit Hakkgala Gardens, Horton Plains and the Seetha Amman Kovil during your visit.
Take a scenic boat ride in the Kande Ella reservoir.
Tips:
Take the train: The journey by train is arguably the best when visiting Nuwara Eliya, booking a first and second-class ticket on short notice is out of the question as seats are booked months in advance.
On the road: If you are driving up to Nuwara Eliya, take your time, stop and enjoy the attractions on the way. Kithulgala is a great stop over. Both Wattawala and Mlesna have great rest houses, each with its own unique offerings.
Take a rain coat or poncho. Its much easier than lugging around an umbrella and can even act as a windbreaker.
The Forest and Lake by Schofieldshire is located at 73/1, Dimuthugama Potato Farm, Meepilimanna, Nuwara Eliya.

Thewarapperuma angered by rehearsal
	
A tense situation prevailed outside the Galewela District Hospital today when Deputy Minister Palitha Thewarapperuma forcibly attended a rehearsal by the hospital authorities to make people aware of dealing with road accidents.
The Galewela Divisional Secretariat, the Disaster Management Centre in Matale and the hospital had organised this rehearsal and they had simulated a road accident where two buses had collided and ten people were injured.
The deputy minister who was on his way to Polonnaruwa had witnessed the incident and had volunteered to take the injured to hospital in his official vehicle.
Only then had he had got to know from the official at the vicinity that it was a rehearsal.
The deputy minister had turned furious and slammed the officials for making fun of such incidents when the country was facing in the throes of major floods.
He had ordered the organisers to hold such rehearsals indoors and vowed to take legal action against them.
This resulted in the hospital authorities deciding to call off the rehearsal. (Mohamed Buharrudeen)

True colours revealed only after retirement
	

A certain high-up retired about one year ago from a service conspicuous by its Dharmachakra emblem is said to be facing charges that he had secured his appointment as well as his promotions to high posts on the strength of fraudulent documents.

This high-up used to throw his weight about and act in a high-handed manner while in service because of his high political connections, they say.
An inquiry is now underway following complaints that the man entered the service and secured his quick promotions by resorting to cheating. It has also come to light that he had produced as his own, his brothers certificates pertaining to educational and other qualifications for securing promotions to high posts.

Trump creates nightmare of a thousand Hiroshimas
	
With the United States scuttling the Iran nuclear deal and casting doubts on a possible dtente with North Korea, the time is ripe once again to turn the worlds attention on nuclear disarmament and give the necessary build-up for the next Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty conference scheduled to be held in 2020.
Though the NPT is regarded as the cornerstone of the global nuclear nonproliferation regime, its ultimate aim is total nuclear disarmament and the promotion of the peaceful use of nuclear energy.
I know not with what weapons World War III will be fought, but World War IV will be fought with sticks and stones, said Albert Einstein, the scientist who was instrumental in the development of atomic bombs, two of which the US dropped on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki during the last stages of World War II.
The presumption in the oft quoted Einstein quote is that World War III would make society collapse into the Stone Age. But this Einstein quote seems out of touch with the gigantic destructive power of modern nuclear weapons. For instance, the Hydrogen bomb which North Korea tested in January 2016 was one thousand times more powerful than the bomb the US dropped on Hiroshima.
According to a LiveScience website report, the bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki exploded with the yield of 15 kilotons and 20 kilotons of TNT, respectively. In contrast, the first test of a thermonuclear weapon, or hydrogen bomb, in the United States in November 1952 yielded an explosion on the order of 10,000 kilotons of TNT. It is simply madness and criminal to keep such weapons, every one of which can destroy one thousand Hiroshimas.
But for world nuclear powers, such concerns hardly matter, for they are more concerned about enhancing their sheer military power that enables them to dominate and plunder the world. When they speak about nuclear disarmament, they will wax eloquent about a nuclear free world and hit out at Iran and North Korea, but when it comes to their own nuclear arsenals, they continue their research to modernize their weapons in a game of one-upmanship with other nuclear powers.
We need total disarmament. Agreements on partial disarmament  the likes of which the US and Russia have entered into in the past  are largely a farce.

"When they speak about nuclear disarmament, they will wax eloquent about a nuclear free world and hit out at Iran and North Korea, but when it comes to their own nuclear arsenals, they continue their research to modernize their weapons in a game of one-upmanship with other nuclear powers"
The five permanent United Nations Security Council members  the US, Russia, Britain, France and China  together with India, Pakistan, Israel and North Korea possess more than 15,000 nuclear weapons. The five permanent members should set an example by denouncing and dismantling their nuclear weapons before they preach disarmament. Strangely or deliberately, Israels nuclear arsenal is left out of the disarmament debate. Israel is believed to possess more than 300 nuclear weapons and has drawn hardly any flak from the US. If Israel, a country that has little respect for international law and human rights, can possess nuclear weapons, what is the big fuss about Iran or North Korea going nuclear The stock answer most Western analysts give is that North Korea and Iran are maverick states which have little respect for international laws and human rights and therefore they cannot be trusted with weapons that can wipe out humanity. This is hypocrisy. Hypocrisy apart, some may argue that partial nuclear disarmament and nonproliferation are certainly better than non-disarmament and proliferation. Therefore, they say enough is enough; no country should hereafter develop nuclear weapons.
But Trumps action only encourages proliferation. By withdrawing from the Iran deal, and placing 12 more new conditions, Trump is now forcing Iran to resume its nuclear programme. Irans spiritual leader Al Khamenei urged European powers to give Iran a guarantee that they would buy Irans oil and continue their trade links with Iran despite US sanctions. He warned, otherwise, Iran would resume its nuclear programme. But many believe that in a bid to protect their companies, the European powers could yield to US pressure, for the European Unions trade volume with the US is 140 times its trade volume with Iran.
Unless the Europeans work out a bypass law similar to the blocking statue the EU nations have adopted to circumvent US sanctions on Cuba, Irans only option is to follow the North Korean example and develop nuclear weapons, a move that will, unfortunately, have a domino effect to prompt Saudi Arabia to start its nuclear weapons programme.
Trump should read what eminent Sri Lankan jurist Chris Weeramanty has said about nuclear weapons. In his dissenting opinion in the famous 1996 ruling on the legality of nuclear weapons, the International Court of Justice judge Weeramantry said:
My considered opinion is that the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons is illegal in any circumstances whatsoever. It violates the fundamental principles of international law, and represents the very negation of the humanitarian concerns which underlie the structure of humanitarian law.

UoC scientists make breakthrough: Present nano technique that kills breast cancer stem cells
	
	Cancer stem cells are found in tumours and possess unique characteristics
	
	
	A significant improvement has been made in research work they conduct to identify novel plant derived natural compounds which can target breast cancerstem cells
	
Researchers at the Institute of Biochemistry, Molecular Biology and Biotechnology (IBMBB) of University of Colombo (UoC) have devised a new technique to target and kill breast cancer stem cells. 
These stem cells are considered to form the root of many cancers, that are hard to treat with available chemo and radio therapy treatment. The researchers developed a nanotechnology assisted targeted delivery system containing a natural compound isolated from an endemic plant from Sri Lanka and a protein which can selectively bind with a protein present in the cell membrane of breast cancer stem cells. 
This research is led by Dr. Sameera R. Samarakoon at the Institute of Biochemistry, Molecular Biology and Biotechnology (IBMBB) and Professor Kamani Tennekon, Professor Neelika Malavige, Professor Nedra Karunarathne, Dr. Meran Keshawa Ediriweera and were helped by Uma Rajagopalan and Amal Hulangamuwa to achieve the desired research goals. 
As we all know cancer is a dreadful disease with limited treatment options. A number of researches are being carried out worldwide to develop a permanent cure for cancer. Unfortunately, a permanent treatment options hasnt been developed yet. Cancer stem cells are found in tumours and possess unique characteristics. They are resistant to chemo and radio therapies and can travel unnoticed by our immune system to form new tumours at any location in the body, which is known as metastasis. 
Research in the field of cancer stem cells is uphill as specifically targeting cancer stem cells has been tough, Dr. Samarakoon said. There are even limited detection methods available to detect these cancer stem cells said Dr. Samarakoon while adding that a significant improvement has been made in research work they conduct to identify novel plant derived natural compounds which can target breast cancer stem cells. He has initiated this work with a grant he received from the National Research Council of Sri Lanka, 2014. The National Science Foundation has provided financial support for the current development work. 
He added that any Sri Lankan who lives abroad can also contribute their research work financially. Depending on the funds we have we are planning to include our new drug candidate in clinical trials,

Venus can make one either a great selfless lover or a cheap philanderer
	
Venus, the planet associated with love and beauty represents worldly happiness and sensual pleasures.
Venus also rules music, literature, good women, luxury, poetry, fine arts and wife or husband.
Venus owns the signs of Libra and Taurus. He is exalted in Pisces ruled by Jupiter and is debilitated in Virgo owned by Mercury. Mars and Saturn are his friends and Moon and Sun are enemies.
Venus rules over the venous system, kidneys, throat, and ovaries.
Ancient Rishis of India have attributed sublime qualities like kindness, compassion and Ahimsa to Venus.

Gets easily corrupted
Venus, the most benefic planet next to Jupiter, despite the sublime qualities he possesses, has no strong will and gets easily corrupted by powerful planets like Saturn and Mars. Venus also loses his good qualities when he is in evil Houses.

Factors that change his natural qualities
Now let us examine the changes Venus undergoes when he is different in signs, Houses and when associated with different planets.
Purity of Venus gets spoilt when he is in the house of Mars or when conjunct with malefics like Mars, Sun, Saturn and Rahu unless the evil effect is nullified by the aspect of Jupiter, a strong Mercury or Moon.

Death-inflicting power
Venus gets death-inflicting powers when he is in the 2nd and 7th Houses. His lordship over the 3rd, 6th or the 11th makes him a malefic.

Venus in signs owned by Mars
Venus in signs owned by Mars at birth will result in the native having intimacies with other women. He would lose his honour, reputation and all worldly possessions in the pursuit of women.

Venus in Libra, Taurus, Gemini, Aquarius and Pisces
Native would be handsome, healthy, intelligent and honourable, and would possess love or aptitude for music and fine arts if Venus at birth is posited in Libra, Taurus, Gemini, Aquarius and Pisces.
Venus confers marital happiness and prosperity on Aries natives if he occupies Taurus, Gemini, Libra or Aquarius.
In Aries and Scorpio, Venus causes marital problems.

Delays marriage
Venus delays marriage when he is in Cancer, Leo, Sagittarius, Capricorn or Scorpio.
Native would become very passionate and lascivious and would even ruin himself by going to extremes to satisfy his sexual desires if Venus occupies Taurus while being aspected by Mars from the Scorpio sign. Similar result would occur if Mars occupies Taurus when Venus is in Scorpio.
Venus in the 5th House of Leo can deny the native marital happiness. Venus in the 6th of Virgo where he is debilitated can give a sickly or impotent partner.
Venus in Sagittarius would give a good partner who is cultured and reasonable. Marriage would not be a success if Venus is posited in Capricorn.
Venus in Aquarius assures a cultured and virtuous partner from an affluent family.
Venus in Pisces where he is exalted holds out a happy married life with a kind, compassionate and considerate partner.
An Aries or Scorpio native with Venus in Gemini would get a partner from among the close relatives. Partner can be a highly qualified academic, but he would not be in good health.
A native with Venus in Cancer would get a partner from overseas who may not be attractive.
Venus in the 10th House of Leo would make finding a suitable partner very difficult.
Venus posited in the 12th of Libra brings about a happy married life with a partner from a distant place. Venus being conjunct with Mars in Libra would not affect the marriage. But Rahu joining the Mars- Venus combination would make the character of thenative suspect.

Waxing eloquent will not help disaster victims
	
Do we have a long-term plan to face the situation with lasting solutions At least do we have proper short-term disaster preparedness
On Tuesday, around noon, on the bank of the Kelani River at Kohilawatte, about a hundred people had thronged to see the rising river.
The river had swollen up to the level of the Colombo Ambatale Road. A thin layer of water was slowly overflowing under their feet towards their houses, on which side the overflowed water had made a small stream.
Having experienced a huge flood two years ago, which had devastated their lives and from which some of them had not recovered yet, fear, frustration and disappointment had drawn on their faces.
Will it be a perilous flood as the one that had inundated the entire lower Kelani valley area in May 2016, leaving tens of thousands of people in the area between Avissawella and Thotalanga destitute for months
While uncertainty was killing, people were translating their hopes and prayers into positive predictions.
There was no reason or knowledge on meteorology and irrigation involved in their predictions, but only their fervent hope and prayer was the only rationale behind their words. They were innocently attempting to deceive each other saying It wont be a flood of the magnitude of the last one.
With one group replacing another, the men, women and children belonging to various communities including Abaya clad Muslim women were visiting the river on foot, cars, bicycles and motorcycles.

"No solution for the problem of landslides and floods is at least thought of, except for the authorities waxing eloquent"

With the river swelling further, the crowds too swelled by the evening. Now, pessimism slowly creeping into their predictions replacing their fragile optimism, while some were still firm that it would not be a major flood.
Among the pessimists were the sadists and supporters of the Opposition political parties, who were ludicrously seen praying for the river water to gush through their own houses, so that they can humiliate their neighbours who are still supporting the ruling parties.
Inside the villages of Kohilawatte, Brandiyawatte, Wennawatte and Sedawatte, people in single-storey houses were carrying their valuables to the two storeyed and three storeyed houses belonging to their relatives and friends.
Those who had no such relatives sat devastated in their houses. By the experience, they had two years ago they knew that everything that can be termed as their wealth would be gone in case of a major flood.
Those living in storeyed houses have started to empty the ground floor while travelling to the river bank now and then to gauge as to how much their preparedness corresponded with the water level in the river.

Some residents started to leave the area to safer areas, leaving their abode and the valuables to the mercy of those deities they believed in.
This was the modal of the agony people were undergoing with the announcement by the Meteorological Department on a possible flood.
One has to imagine the real situation in areas on the banks of the Kelani Ganga, Kalu Ganga, Nilwala Ganga and other rivers that had already been marooned in flood waters. 
The anguish in landslide-prone areas is worse, as nature would not provide such a grace period for them to move away from the danger. They would have to pay the price for their indifference, delay or helplessness with their lives.
This has been the norm of the people living in river valleys and steep slopes. Pathetically and ridiculously only thing the Sri Lankan Governments do and apparently know in such situations is to tell the people to evacuate the hazardous areas and toss off a small number of relief items to the victims after the disaster struck them.
In the meantime, the Opposition parties would look for holes in those relief activities, not out of the love for the people but to take political mileage out of the real and perceived indifference, shortcomings, blunders and lethargy in the government machinery in rescue and relief measures.
This time also the Joint Opposition demanded a Parliamentary debate on floods, interestingly while the water level was still rising in several rivers.
Going by the previous experience, people know that the Government would let them down in case of disasters.

"Sadists and supporters of the Opposition political parties, who were ludicrously seen praying for the river water to gush through their own houses, so that they could humiliate their neighbours who were still supporting the ruling parties "


During the major flood in 2016 in the Kelani Valley ordinary people, as well as religious and voluntary organisations, were far ahead of the Government in rescuing and providing relief to the victims.
Fishermen from faraway places such as Beruwala and Wattala had sent in their boats to rescue the marooned people in Kotikawatte, Kohilawatte and Sedawatte and to provide food for the marooned people before the government authorities did so. And the navy continued the effort thereafter for about a week.
The disaster warnings by the authorities in most of the times did not make sense for the victims or the would-be-victims. Rainfall in millimetres or the water level in rivers in feet does not inform a particular family whether it is really in danger.
There must be a specifically localized warning mechanism.
In last two years, while showing on TV the shiploads and planeloads of relief items being unloaded the authorities provided only a pack of essential food items worth Rs. 1,500 (valued by them) for each affected family for the whole first two months after the tragedy, while getting the victims to fill so many forms with promises to pay compensation for their losses and damages.
It was after two months and after a poster campaign by the JVP demanding the payment that had been promised to cover their immediate needs a sum of Rs. 10,000 was provided to each family.
After distributing several forms over a period of 18 months, on the eve of the last years Local Government Elections Government authorities paid compensation to the victims ranging from Rs. 25,000 to Rs.200,000, on a criterion well-known to them.

"On the eve of the last years Local Government, Elections Government authorities paid compensation to the victims ranging from Rs. 25,000 to Rs.200,000, on a criterion well-known o them"

High-level meetings were held during the 2016 disasters where politicians and officials waxed eloquent on short-term and long-term plans for the prevention of floods, especially in the Colombo District and mitigating landslide damages.
They talked about removing unauthorized structures that hampered the waterways and their maintenance, clearing of all canals in the downstream of Kelani Ganga, stopping forthwith the unauthorized filling of wetlands in Colombo and the suburbs.
Interestingly, they exposed their credence this time by again calling for the removal of unauthorized structures in the same areas.
The Daily Mirror had editorially discussed this issue last year and following is a very pertinent paragraph of it.
Are the same people in the Kelani Valley to carry their belongings to safer places with the onset of next years South Western Monsoon as well This applies to the people living on the banks of other rivers flowing through the wet zone, as well. Are people in many landslide prone hills to run away with their children and feeble old parents to a school or temple building every time authorities alert them of landslides
With environmentalists and the scientists predicting that the severity of precipitation and the drought would mount with the climate change affecting every country in the world, (They say dry get drier, wet gets wetter (DGDWGW) ) we would also have to expect more and more floods, landslides and droughts in Sri Lanka as well.
Do we have a long-term plan to face the situation with lasting solutions At least do we have proper short-term disaster preparedness
No solution for the problem of landslides and floods is at least thought of, except for the authorities waxing eloquent.

What you should know about your period
	

Do you hate those few days when you are on your period Does it hurt so badly that your concentration is slightly impaired As much as these are mutual feelings among girls and women experiencing menstruation across the world, there is absolutely nothing you could do about this process.
Hormones are special chemical messengers in the body that are created by the endocrine glands. These messengers control most major bodily functions from simple basic needs such as hunger to complex systems such as reproduction to controlling emotions and your mood. In the case of menstruation, it is once again a hormonal change where Oestrogen- the female sex hormone causes puberty, prepares the body and uterus for pregnancy and regulates the menstrual cycle. In view of the World Menstrual Hygiene Management Day- which falls on May 28- the Mirror Health Capsule sheds light on the importance of the menstrual process to a girls health, why one should maintain her personal hygiene during their period and treating irregularities. 

Cultural beliefs
According to Dr. Sanath Lanerolle, Consultant Obstetrician and Gynaecologist at the Castle Street Hospital, this is a transition period where the girl becomes an adult. Therefore there are many changes happening to her physical health and mentality as well. There are many cultural beliefs related to menstruation. According to Sri Lankan culture we celebrate with a function the onset of menstruation which is called Menarche. Some cultures have a belief that during menstruation the girl is not clean; hence they are not allowed to enter temples and religious places. Generally a young girl gets the knowledge and education from her elder relations and it could be the mother, sister or grandmother. Therefore there is no formal education on this matter. Reproductive health is included only in certain syllabi and it is doubtful whether these subjects are taught in depth in the national curriculum as well. Even in general health education these topics are not taught in depth,said Dr. Lanerolle.
But when you consider the physiology of menstruation there is no truth in these beliefs, Dr. Lanerolle added. It is the normal blood that passes with the shedding off of the inner lining of the womb (Endometrium) which gets Hypertrophied (enlarged) so that the fertilized eggs could come and deposit on it. This is known as implantation. When this process doesnt take place it is called an Aborted Cycle and when theres no pregnancy it causes the shedding off of the endometrium. This is happening due to hormonal changes regulated by the hypothalamus-pituitary-ovarian axis.

Personal hygiene
Speaking about the importance of maintaining personal hygiene, Dr. Lanerolle said that in the physiological perspective there is no truth about the girl or woman not being clean during their period. But the blood that passes is good culture media and if you do not maintain personal hygiene, many bacteria and viruses can get nutrition from it and multiply. They can live there if youre unclean and you will end up with many problems, also known as Endometritis - the inflammation of the inner lining of the womb. As a result there could be many outcomes due to this uncleanliness. It could in turn lead to the formation of abscesses in the pelvis leading up to permanent sterilization. Sanitary napkins need to be changed regularly for a day in order to avoid infections. There are two kinds of sanitary towels - the normal napkin and tampons. Tampons are inserted into the vagina and those wearing sanitary napkins should have a good practice of changing it frequently. But the danger of tampons is that the user might forget to remove it. Therefore if it exists in the vagina, it will lead up to severe infections causing death, also known as Toxic Shock Syndrome. Therefore those using tampons have to be extra cautious about removing them at the correct time. 
In Sri Lanka there are certain cases of these kinds of infections. Generally during your period you should have a bath and stay clean. Also one should allow the flow to happen without blocking it. In addition to that, proper practices and disposal of sanitary napkins too should be encouraged, Dr. Lanerolle said.

Precautions
During your period your mothers would have probably given you a special diet. This may include cooling foods such as cucumber, king coconut and the like. Dr. Lanerolle too agrees that there are certain foods which are allergic to women during this period. Those allergies are known by those people only. Generally foods containing histamines including tuna fish and prawns could cause increased blood loss.
In addition to that, girls or women also worry about doing heavy work during their period. They may refrain from going to the gym and taking a good rest instead. According to Dr. Lanerolle, if youre having a lighter period, doing light exercises and general work is alright. But certain women have a severe pain and a heavy flow. They need to rest. If theres a pain it should be investigated rather than taking panadol and other painkillers haphazardly in order to ensure that there are no underlying diseases. There are diseases such as endometriosis, pelvic inflammatory diseases, certain tumours such as fibroids and ovarian cysts among others. Taking panadol is not the treatment for these diseases and it is important to treat the disease as and when its identified. But having excluded these diseases sometimes people take painkillers and that is not a big issue,said the doctor.
This is a hormone-regulated cycle and if it doesnt happen it will lead to a lot of diseases because the inner lining of the womb will become thicker, which could even cause endometrial cancers. In certain parts of Sri Lanka people still use other materials for their sanitary napkins as they cannot afford to buy branded items. According to Dr. Lanerolle using these materials is alright as long as the user is conscious about the cleanliness and hygiene. Back in the day when sanitary napkins were not available our parents used to wear a cloth. They used clean and dry towels. The absorbing power is different because the modern napkin absorbs the blood and keeps it dry as well. But in the case of normal clothes, they will absorb the blood but it will be wet, he added.

Irregularities and complications
Irregular blood flow could happen due to the hypothalamus-pituitary-ovarian axis, Dr. Lanerolle further said. They are hormonal causes, but if youre having fibroid in the womb there will be an irregular flow. In the case of endometriosis also it is the same. Some women using contraceptive methods may also experience irregular blood flow. If there is an excessive blood flow you are losing the amount of blood in the system. Usually it is 80ml of blood per cycle that is lost but if you are losing more than that people will experience symptoms of anaemia from lethargy to mood changes,said Dr. Lanerolle.
Speaking about treatments, he further said that treatments for these irregularities depend on the cause. If there is a fibroid it has to be removed. In the case of a hormone irregularity, the hormonal cycle needs to be regulated by regulating external hormones. If it is caused by pelvic inflammatory disease then antibiotics need to be given to cure it, he said.
In his concluding remarks, Dr. Lanerolle said that menstruation is a physiological event and it shouldnt hamper education or the number of working hours. Generally it is found that during this period your power of concentration is a little bit impaired. However, there is medication in the event of heavy blood flow or frequent periods thereby reducing most symptoms by regulating the menstrual cycle. During this period you need to have a high protein diet because you are losing blood. Some people say not to eat meat and other food but scientifically theres no truth in it. During the period one should know what is normal to have and not. It is also important to maintain the personal hygiene and have a good nutrition as well, he concluded.

Young ones request carried more weight
	

This senior politico is known to all in political circles as a very close buddy of a high political authority. However, he is said to be giving the high authority a wide berth these days.

The politico had made an earnest appeal to the high political authority to grant a service extension to a star badge wearing high up while another young one had asked the latter to send the man home without extending his service. The high political authority had readily complied with the young ones request, who, incidentally, is also close to him.
Feeling slighted that his request was ignored and long-faced ever since the incident, the senior politico is said to be avoiding any face-to-face meeting with the high political authority these days.
