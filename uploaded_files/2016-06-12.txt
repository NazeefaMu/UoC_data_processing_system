Action against jumbo will affect Peraheras: Bellanvila Wimalarathana Thera
	
The steps taken by the Wildlife Conservation Department and the environmental authorities regarding the owners of elephants were questionable, Chancellor of the Sri Jayawardenepura University and Chief Incumbent of the Bellanwila Rajamaha Vihara Ven. Bellanvila Wimalarathana Thera said.
He told the media during a meeting to organize the Esala festival that the temples were facing hardship for want of elephants for processions and other religious ceremonies.
Ven .Thera said the environmentalists in the country were at the beck and call of the Western elements and had little knowledge on Sri Lankan culture.
The elephants formed a part of the fourfold army of the ancient kings, but the environmentalists or animal lovers did not point an accusing finger at it. It is sad that the authorities have disputed the possession of elephants creating a serious crisis and the worst affected by it are the religious ceremonies at temples,? Ven. Wimlarathana Thera said.
Ven. Thera stressed the need to formulate a national policy on possessing elephants and tuskers or else it would result in serious consequences affecting the Sri Lankan culture. (H.M.Dharmapala and Kusal Chamath)

Never, another war in SL- Maj.Gen Senanayake
	
The Commander of the Security Forces in Jaffna, Major General Mahesh Senanayake asserted on Saturday that there would never be another war in Sri Lanka.
Briefing the media on the present situation in the North he opined that the presence of the army in the North had helped the citizens greatly and their services are greatly acclaimed.
He said that despite this consensus building up the TNA politicians are clamouring for the removal of the army from the North claiming that the war had ended seven years ago. The Chief Minister of Northern Province C.V. Wigneswaran had been quoted as having said in Vavuniya and some other places in the North that the Army in the North should be replaced by the police in providing security to the people in the North, he added.
Army had been having a very close rapport with the people at all religious functions and in disaster in the North. The war which dragged on for a number of years had apparently distanced the Army from interacting with the people, but now it is time for the people to realise who the Army and other security sections really are. They can now present their problems to the nearest Army camp and obtain redress and also submit to them any appeals for assistance, he stated.(Romesh Madushanka)
