ATM card cloning gang with SL, Mumbai links nabbed
	
The Chittoor police in India on Saturday nabbed a five-member gang hailing from Tamil Nadu involved in ATM-cloning offences while they were about to strike at an ATM centre at Palamaner and seized Rs. 10 lakh, electronic gadgets used for cloning ATM cards, capturing details of PIN numbers and swiping machines.
Addressing a press conference at Palamaner town, SP S.V. Rajasekhar Babu and DSP K. Chowdeswari said after 70-days of gruelling investigation in Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Maharashtra, the five-member gang was apprehended.
The officials said it was the first cyber crime to be registered and busted in the State.
On August 24, a farmer of Palamaner was stunned to observe that <U+20B9>1.58 lakh had been withdrawn from his account through ATM, despite the fact that the card was very much in his pocket. Within a few weeks, 22 customers of various banks became victims in the district.
Ms. Chowdeswari, considered an expert in dealing with cyber crimes, was entrusted with the assignment to track down the offenders.
At Palamaner, Panjani and Renigunta in Chittoor district, the special teams detected the clandestine use of mobile numbers meant for setting up of wi-fi connected CC cameras to obtain the PIN numbers at the ATMs.
The gang had obtained the cloning technology from one Alfred Bala Kumar of Sri Lanka and Umesh of Mumbai, paying them hefty commissions for each successful crime.
The officials said the modus operandi of the gang was to select isolated ATM centres and fix skimmers (mouths) at the swiping ends which would collect the ATM card details. They arranged the wi-fi enabled CC cameras to capture the PIN numbers. In a couple of hours, the cloned cards would be ready. To evade being captured and in view of the ceiling on withdrawal, the gang would finish their work before and after midnight.
The special party on Friday night detected the mobile signals of the suspected gang in and around Palamaner. After alerting the checkposts and using the relevant technology, Ms. Chowdeswari and her team zeroed in on the gang at an ATM centre early Saturday, while they were busy attempting withdrawals with cloned cards. The gang members were identified as Niranjan (37); S. Mohiddin (25), MSK. Rakshit (28), A. Suresh (26) of Chennai city and B. Tamilasaran (25) of Krishnagiri in Tamil Nadu. Two other accused from Sri Lanka and Mumbai are at large, and a special team has been formed to track them. It is suspected that half- a-dozen gangs might be on the prowl in various parts of the State.
During interrogation, it was found that the gang had recently tried in vain to collect details of cards at an ATM centre in Mangalagiri of Guntur district .(The Hindu)

LG Polls in first week of Feb. 2018, says Ranil
	
The Local Government Polls will be held in the first week of February next year, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said today. However he said the ultimate decision on this would be decided by the Election Commission.
The Prime Minister gave this assurance at a public meeting in Bingiriya last evening. "The next local government election will be actually a trial to test the effectiveness of the new mixed electoral system introduced recently and if it is a success it will be used for the Parliamentary polls as well" he said.
" The mixed electoral system was first proposed by the select committee appointed by the UNP in 2003.This committee was chaired by MP Dinesh Gunawardene. However we were not in favour of everything proposed by that committee. Therefore discussions took place and finally all the parties agreed on one system and it was unanimously passed in Parliament," he added.
The Prime Minister recalled that a new electoral system was introduced in order to address some of the deficiencies of the PR system as candidates of the same party used to attack each other to get more preferential votes," he said.
Mr Wickremesinghe took the opportunity to thank all those who filed legal action against the delimitation commission for agreeing to withdraw their petitions. " I got the Minister of Local Government Faiszer Musthapha to discuss matters with them and come to an amicable agreement," he added while stating that the courts did not heed the request made by the Attorney General to expedite the hearing of the case prior to the petitions being withdrawn.
He said the mixed system will bring back the ward system which existed before where 40 per cent of the candidates would be elected according to the votes which political parties receive.
Mr Wickremesinghe explained that his party had decided to form a government with the SLFP as the UNP was a forward thinking party with a vision for the country. " It is obvious that our two parties face issues as we are two separate political parties. However we are going forward together " he said.
UNP Deputy General Secretary and Minister of Education Akila Viraj Kariyawasam invited all SLFPers to join the UNP. " I would like to invite SLFP members to join us and help to develop the nation at this time," he said. (Yohan Perera in Bingiriya)

## Title: SL family in Canada hopes for last-minute reprieve from deportation

SL family in Canada hopes for last-minute reprieve from deportation
	
After spending five years in Montreal fighting for asylum, a Sri Lankan family is launching a final plea to stay in Canada.
Robert Lawrence and his family have had their refugee claim refused by the Canadian government and will be deported on Sunday night.
His family hasn't even started packing up their two-bedroom apartment in Parc-Extension.
"I feel very sad, and you know, I don't know what to do," said Lawrence.
Lawrence, who is Tamil, worked for the United Nations in Sri Lanka's Eastern province during the time of a brutal civil war that ended up with the defeat of the separatist Tamil Tigers by the Sri Lankan majority Sinhalese government.
With the hopes of protecting his family, Lawrence made the decision to leave their home and fly to the U.S. They crossed into Canada in 2012.
After moving to Montreal, Lawrence's wife, three daughters, son and daughter-in-law have since integrated into their community.
They have carved out new lives in Quebec, where everyone works or attends school. Lawrence even volunteers at his church in Outremont.
"After five years it's very hard to go back and re-establish everything in our country," he said. "Other than that I don't know what's going to happen to us."
Their children have also flourished. They speak both English and  with a lot of time and effort  have learned to speak, write, read and live in French.
All three daughters have their sights set on post-secondary education.
For 21-year-old Leony Pavinthra Lawrence, the impending deportation means she will not be able to pursue her studies at College Ahuntsic. She hopes to become an oncologist.
"I'm not asking for anything else, I am just asking for studies, so they could have let me study, but they didn't," she said.
"I can't do anything, it's not in my hands, so I just have to be disappointed  that's all I can do."
Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada said it cannot comment on specific cases, but that "people being removed from Canada are not sent to a country where they would be in danger or at risk of persecution."
But the family is worried what deportation will hold for them since they were targeted for Lawrence's reporting to the UN on what was unfolding during the civil war.
"We are taking a risk and the government is making us take that risk," said son Leon Lawrence.
Politicians, lawyers and the school board of the daughters are now calling on Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale to issue a reprieve.
"This family has surmounted all of these difficulties and have shown their capacity to integrate in our society," said Qubec Solidaire MNA Amir Khadir.
"We have every reason to welcome this family in Montreal, in Quebec."
NDP MP Alexandre Boulerice also said that he was counting on Goodale to intervene in a situation that "makes no sense."
"We don't want to lose them," he said.(CBC News)

SL players struggle due to Delhi pollution; wear face masks
	
Delhi pollution has become a menace for the residents of Delhi in recent months. And on Sunday, it came to affect the Sri Lankan players during the Test against India at Feroz Shah Kotla stadium.
Coming back from lunch, several Sri Lankan cricketers including captain Dinesh Chandimal, Suranga Lakmal and Lakash Sadakanan were seen spotting gas masks on the field. The sight of seeing cricketers with the masks bothered the commentators Sanjay Manjrekar and Russel Arnold who said it will get difficult to play with the masks. They further said that seamers will particularly face difficulty while bowling.
Manjrekar further said that Indian players, who came on the field to give water to the players, were also seen with the masks before. Sri Lankan pacer Lahiru Gamage and Suranga Lakmal felt particularly bothered by the pollution and starting panting while bowling. A break was called on by the umpires to discuss the playing conditions at Kotla after Gamage started coughing while bowling.
Both the captains discussed with umpires whether the game should be continued as Chandimal stressed his players were not comfortable on the field. The third umpire and match referee were also appraised of the situation and medical teams were brought on the field to take a look at whether the players can continue to play.
After plenty of discussions, which lasted for about 15 minutes, Sri Lankan fielders went back to their fielding positions, still wearing masks and the game was resumed again. It is the first time ever in the history of international cricket that a Test match was held up due to pollution concerns.(The Indian Express)
