19A still inoperative,will take a few more days-Minister
	
Justice Minister Dr. Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe said yesterday it would take a few days for the 19th Amendment to the Constitution to come into force though it was initially set to be operative from April 30 onwards.
The Minister said there were a lot of amendments proposed during the Committee Stage of the debate, and they should all be incorporated into the Bill. After that, he said it had to be perused both by the Attorney General and the Legal Draftsman.
?Then only, the Speaker can sign it into an Act. Once the Speaker certifies, it will come into force. Otherwise, it was set to be operative from April 30. But, we have to wait for the Speaker?s Certification,? he said. ?
The Minister said the entire process would take at least three or four days.
The 19th Amendment, once coming into force, will restrict the presidential term to five years. It will provide for the setting up of the Constitutional Council. The Cabinet size will also be reduced to 30. However, a few clauses related to the Judicial Service Commission will come into force only after the next general election.
?During the committee stage, around 60 clauses were amended,? he said. (KB)

CAA directs private hospitals to issue detailed bills
	
The Consumer Affairs Authority has directed that all private hospitals should issue a comprehensive bill mentioning the price, details of medicinal drugs and equipment used for patients, a CAA official said today.
The move has been taken following a string of complaints received by the CAA from Doctors and as well as patients, CAA Chairman Rumi Marzook said.
?Some private hospitals, doctors, channeling centres and outpatient departments (OPDs) are issuing bills in which they have included very expensive price details of medicinal drugs. They are the same medicinal drugs given at various prices in the market. It is a burden on the patients,? Marzook said.
Meanwhile, the CAA Chairman requested the hospital authorities to take action to ensure the safety, efficiency and good quality medicinal drugs given to patients according to the National Medicine Regulatory Authority Bill which was passed in parliament recently.
