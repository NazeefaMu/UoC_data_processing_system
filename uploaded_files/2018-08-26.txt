Don?t panic over Seema Malakaya rumours: Megapolis Ministry
	
Responding to rumours of development around Japan-Sri Lanka Friendship Road in Sri Jayewardenepura, Kotte, the Megapolis Ministry today said that there would be no such land-filling in the Kimbulawala Lake.
Megapolis Additional Secretary Madhawa Waidyaratne told the Daily Mirror that only a temporary Access Road was being constructed towards the recently built Seema Malaka in Diyawanna Oya to ease off carrying building materials to the construction site.
He said the Access Road would be removed within a period of one month after the concrete structure was built.
The public-funded structure, a gift to the Amarapura Maha Sangha Sabha, was originally planned to be constructed as a floating structure.
?A construction flaw identified in one of the four water-filled barges caused the entire structure to sink midway of the construction process, therefore it was later decided to fit bars underwater as a support structure,? he said.
Mr Waidyaratne said that due to technical difficulties, the private entity that launched the project had requested the Sri Lanka Land Reclamation and Development Corporation (SLLRDC) for support.
He said the Ministry, considering the project as a pioneer spiritual development need, had agreed to support the company to carry out the project.
Mr Waidyaratne said SLLRDC had identified the need for a temporary access road to transport the machinery and materials to the site and had begun its work.
However, he assured that there would be no landfilling or handing over lands to any individual or company via the process.
He also explained that there was no impact to area?s water volume or no flood threat to the area because of the work.
?The Ministry request residents around the area not to panic over rumours about any threat,? her said.
The Daily Mirror in a news article dated May 26 titled Section of Seema Malakaya on Diyawanna has sunk, reported that the floating structure built by a private construction company on the Diyawanna Oya for use as a Seema Malakaya by the Amarapura Maha Sangha Sabha had partially sunk because of a construction issue.

SLC rejects ticket 'rip off' claim
	
Sri Lanka Cricket authorities Sunday rejected claims of discrimination against England fans in the pricing of tickets for an upcoming tour, saying both foreign and local supporters would be charged the same.
England will play five one-day internationals, a one-off Twenty20 match and three Tests between October 10 and November 27 at four venues - Colombo, Dambulla, Galle and Pallekele.
British media reports have alleged a "rip off", with England fans charged ?50 while locals paid only ?1.50 (307 rupees).
Sri Lanka Cricket administrative chief Aruna de Silva said the English media had compared the price of tickets in the most expensive enclosure to those in the cheapest open stands.
"Whether it is an English fan or a local they pay the same rate. There is no discrimination whatsoever. If England fans want to, they are welcome to buy the cheapest tickets," de Silva told AFP.
He said grandstand tickets were available through a hospitality company which had bought the rights for Test matches.
The company was bundling food and drinks with tickets to the air-conditioned enclosure and charging a premium on the standard rates, but that applied equally to both foreigners and locals, de Silva said.
In Colombo, the grandstand is priced at 5,000 rupees ($31 or ?24) while the cheapest ticket would cost 300 rupees ($1.87, ?1.47), de Silva said. For Test matches, the fifth day's play is free.
England fans known as the Barmy Army have asked Sri Lankan cricket authorities to reduce prices for them. But de Silva said they could not cut prices for foreigners when locals were being charged the full ticket price.

US Senator John McCain dies aged 81
	
US Senator John McCain, the Vietnam war hero turned senator and presidential candidate, has died aged 81.
Mr McCain died on Saturday surrounded by his family, according to a short statement released by his office.
He was diagnosed with an aggressive brain tumour in July 2017 and had been undergoing medical treatment.
His family announced Mr McCain, who left Washington in December, had decided to stop treatment on Friday.
Mr McCain's daughter Meghan said the task of her lifetime would now be "to live up to his example, his expectations, and his love".
"The days and years to come will not be the same without my dad - but they will be good days, filled with life and love, because of the example he lived for us," she wrote in a statement shared on Twitter.
The six-term senator and 2008 Republican presidential nominee was diagnosed after doctors discovered his tumour during surgery to remove a blood clot from above his left eye last July.
The son and grandson of Navy admirals, Mr McCain was a fighter pilot during the Vietnam War. When his plane was shot down, he spent more than five years as a prisoner of war.
While in the custody of his captors, he suffered torture that left him with lasting disabilities.(BBC)

Will show a change under different Govt, says Arjuna
	
People who did not have any knowledge about cricket had destroyed the Sri Lankan national team, former Sri Lankan Cricket Captain, Petroleum Resources Development Minister Arjuna Ranatunga said.
Ranatunga was the captain of Sri Lankan cricket team that won the 1996 ICC World Cup.
?I will remain silent, as Sports Minister Faiszer Musthapha knows the subject well. But I will break the silence and make the team better perform under a different political leadership in future,? he said.
He said so attending the publishing of book 'Sellam da Sellam' authored by Thameera Manju at the BMICH.
The writer Thameera Manju is a Journalist and the current Media Secretary to the Minister.
Minister Ranatunga hinted that the Sports Minister Musthapha knew the game and its rules better than him.
?Faiszer knows the cricket and the rules better. Therefore, I will leave the business to him and stay silent. But I will take up the game under a different Government,? he said.
Minister Ranatunga, saying that he would never accept the portfolio of Sports Minister, however, said that he would accept Sri Lanka Cricket only under a different political leadership and that within six months he would show a difference.
?I am not in a position to accept that responsibility now as I hold another responsibility,? he said.
?I?m not greedy. No one can challenge that I cannot oversee cricket and no one has the right than I do.
?Today players are not allowed to be a member of the cricket administration. Several individuals have destroyed the cricket in Sri Lanka. It was a shame to say that Sports Ministers have also support that,? he said.
Minister Ranatunga added that the public would provide the correct answers to all of them during future elections. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
