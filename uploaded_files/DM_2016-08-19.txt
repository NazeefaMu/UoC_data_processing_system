Deputy Government Whip and United National Party (UNP) MP Ashu Marasinghe said yesterday he had written to Speaker Karu Jayasuriya requesting him to launch an inquiry into statements made by some joint opposition MPs that they had urged him to refrain from certifying the Office on Missing Persons (OMP) Bill.
In a news article published in Daily Mirror dated on August 18, the JO MPs had urged the Speaker not to endorse the OMP Bill.
Referring to the article, Mr. Marasinghe said certifying a Bill passed in the House was a legislative duty cast on the Speaker according to Article 79 of the Constitution.
If anyone opposes this or implores on you to refrain from doing so are in other words pressuring you to deviate from the salutary provisions of the Constitution. Any person who does this will be guilty of a breach of privilege of Parliament, he said in the letter to the Speaker.
He requested the Speaker to inquire into the matter and take necessary action if the JO had done so.

Provision reversal ups BoC June net by 36% amid narrowing margins
	
State-owned banking giant, Bank of Ceylon (BoC) saw its June quarter net profits growing by 36 percent to Rs.4.9 billion from a year ago amid compressing margins, slower growth in loans and narrowed fee-based incomes, the interim results filed with the Colombo bourse showed.
The net interest income was almost flat as the cost of the deposits rose faster than the interest income from its loan book amid rising interest rates, but the growth in the bottom-line was supported by the absence of provisions against the possible bad loans.
The total operating income before such provisions was up by a paltry 3.0 percent year-on-year (yoy) to Rs. 17.1 billion as the net fee and commission income too dived 13 percent to Rs.1.26 billion from a year ago. 
Provisions for possible loans had a reversal of Rs.181 million in the June quarter against the massive Rs.3.4 billion provisioning during the same quarter last year, which largely helped to cushion the bottom-line.
The banking group saw its interest expenses rising by 25 percent to Rs.20.6 billion from a year ago, more than doubling the increase in interest income of Rs.33.5 billion, up by 14 percent yoy. This dented the net interest margin to 3.18 percent from 3.30 percent in December 2015.
The bank on a standalone basis expanded its loan book by Rs.48.7 billion or 5.6 percent during the first six months of the year.
The businesses pursued a wait-and-see approach for investments during the period and therefore applyied for less bank credit for investments. Further, the lending to some of the key public enterprises also remained low as their financial positions improved, specially of the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation and Ceylon Electricity Board.
Some of the key public enterprises did repay part of their borrowings too, the Central Bank said last month.
However, personal loans grew by a massive Rs.33.7 billion, while the housing loans had Rs.2.7 billion new loans.
Foreign currency loans contracted by Rs.27 billion during the six months, comprising repayments made by the borrowers. 
The Central Bank, concerned about the continued growth in private credit, raised its key policy rates by 50 basis points in July to further curb the credit flows into private persons in a move to keep the demand-driven inflation under check.
BoC has a total loan book of Rs. 919.4 billion.
Meanwhile, the deposits grew by Rs.36.6 billion or 3.4 percent, but the low-cost funds as measured by the current and savings account (CASA) ratio fell to 44.9 percent from 46.5 percent due to depositors moving towards high-yielding fixed deposits.
The bank as of June 30, 2016, had a total deposit portfolio of Rs.1.12 trillion, rgw highest attained by any bank in Sri Lanka.
The total asset base of the bank grew by a little under 1 percent to Rs.1.58 trillion.
Asset quality further improved as the gross non-performing loan ratio dropped to 3.18 percent from 3.30 percent in December 2015.
The prudential indicators, the banks Tier I and Tier II capital adequacy ratio, stood at 8.26 percent and 11.88 percent respectively. The regulatory minimums are 5 percent and 10 percent each. 
The government is the lone shareholder of the bank. 
For the six months ended on June 30, 2016, the bank made a net profit of Rs. 10.8 billion, up 65 percent from a year ago. The total provisions for the period was down to Rs.405.5 million from a massive Rs.7.6 billion during the same period last year.

SLS certification mandatory for helmets from Sept. 1
	
The manufacturing, importation, distribution, storage and sale of helmets without an SLS certification issued by the Sri Lanka Standards Institution (SLSI) would be banned with effect from September 1, the Consumer Affairs Authority (CAA) said yesterday.
The CAA said it had published a gazette in this regard in 2015.
The Authority directed all manufacturers, importers, distributors and traders not to manufacture or offer protective helmets for sale unless such helmets bore the SLS certification.
The Sri Lanka Standards Institution issues the SLS 517 certification mark for protective helmets for vehicle users.
Helmets that are presently sold in the market are classified into two categories-Type A, intended for competitive events and for use by wearers who demand an especially high degree of protection and Type B, intended for the ordinary motor cycle riders on public roads.
The CAA warned that strict action would be taken against those who would violate the new regulations that come into effect on Sept. 1. (Darshana Sanjeewa)

The truth will be sought; not retribution: PM
	
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said yesterday that the truth would be sought but that it would not result in retribution, as the past would be put aside.
He said so at the launch of the law students' journal, Manuwara at the Law College last evening.
The Office of Missing Persons (OMP) will lead to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. The truth may be ugly. But we can live with that. Truth should not lead to retribution. We should put the past behind us. We have a future ahead. There may be different ideas from time to time and different concepts. How do we do it like any other country Our systems have to be strong enough. India went through this once in the 1970s under Ms Gandhi. Their system was strong enough and recovered. Our system can also recover and is recovering, he said, outlining what would be done after the OMP takes up cases of missing persons.
He said prosecution, if necessary, would be according to the existing laws in Sri Lanka
If there is to be prosecution we can do it under our law. We had a system which was trusted. We had cases. The rapes in Jaffna, Kokodichcholai and a few other places. No one complained. Some were acquitted, some were convicted. There were no complaints about the trials. Our systems were not functioning. But now that they are functioning we should not be afraid. Lets try and strengthen them. Lets take steps to rectify situations. I am not saying you should conduct a witch-hunt where some young army officers may be tried, he said.
He said there may be a few cases of human right violations. There may be a few cases against some who are dead. There cant be many. A large number of people were killed. So we are opening this missing persons office. It is for the future also. It will deal with cases of students who have gone missing and journalists like Ekneligoda. Just find out the information about them and put it on record. We would all like to know how many are missing. You might say some one is missing but you may suddenly find out that the man is living well in Denmark, he said.
You have a war, a conflict. When you try to bring it under control there are violations of human rights. There is no country in which this has not happened. We are open about it. We discuss it. You cant hide it. We tried to hide it. We said we cant have cases. But we had a case and threw a man in jail. We had a case, we tried one man -- Army Commander Fonseka. We threw him in jail in white flag case. How can you say you cant have a trial after this We appointed the Paranagama Commission and some say, "Dont publish the report". We cant go on for ever and ever with this issue, he said.
"In the end there should be reconciliation. Deaths have occurred, killings have taken place. There are no leaders on one side. All are dead now, except for one man who was brought back and kept somewhere in Kilinochchi. Lets go for reconciliation. he said. (Yohan Perera)

5 Things You Should Know About Bitcoin
	
Okay, what is Bitcoin in the first place Well, its a digital currency which is obtained and held
electronically, it's tied to no banks, and, perhaps the most appealing aspect of Bitcoin, noone controls it. Encryption techniques are used to regulate the generation of units ofcurrency and verify the transfer of funds. To the amazement, according to USA survey, only24% of people know what Bitcoin is.
Creator of the Bitcoin
Bitcoin is a digital currency that was created in 2008 by Satoshi Nakamoto. But one of thestrangest things about the currency is creator, Nakamoto. Despite the code name, his or heridentity remains completely unknown.
Creator wallet
It is estimated that the creator of Bitcoin, hold large amount of Bitcoins, which are worth of 480 million US dollars.
Earliest Transaction
In 2010, two pizzas were bought using 10,000 Bitcoins. But, the value of Bitcoins are in therise since then. As for today the two pizzas were worth over 4 million US dollars.
Mining Computers
Computer power of the computer that runs and mines Bitcoins grew tremendously high. Itssaid that the computer power enhanced 30,000% in 2013. Its power is very high comparedto the modern supercomputers. 256 times more powerful than the worlds top 500supercomputers combined.
Finite Supply
Since, Bitcoins are mined by computers solving algorithms, as there is a finite supply of it,
the last will be mined in 2140 when there will be 21 million Bitcoins circulation.As of the time of this writing, according to CoinBase, a Bitcoin is worth of 576.87 US dollars

Usain Bolt wins gold in 200m final
	
The Jamaican won gold in the mens 200m final, beating his rivals with a time of 19.78 seconds.
Its his third Olympic gold medal in the event, further reinforcing his status as one of the greatest athletes weve ever seen.
Its also his second gold of the Rio Games to go with his victory in the 100m earlier in the week.
Canadas Andre de Grasse was second, Frances Christophe Lemaitre won bronze.
Despite his incredible feat, Bolt looked less than impressed after he crossed the line well ahead of his rivals.
That was probably because he wasnt able to break his own world record of 19.19 seconds  a mark he was hoping to reset here in Brazil.
His anger at not being able to achieve that goal was laid squarely at the feet of his rivals, according to ESPNs Anthony Becht.
Hes the ultimate showman whos never been shy of speaking his mind. Bolt had a crack at de Grasse for pushing him too hard in the 200m semi-final, and now hes taken aim at his fellow runners again.
Ironically, by his logic, the very reason he was upset with de Grasse on Thursday (AEST) was the very thing he desperately craved in the final.
Speaking to Channel 7s Pat Welsh after the race, Bolt admitted his race was tinged with sadness, knowing it was the last time hed ever run the event at an Olympics, but was still proud of what hed accomplished.
I have proven to the world over and over again that I am the greatest. That is all I can do, he said.
I really wanted to race faster, but I came out here to win and thats the first thing. Im happy about that.
Just coming back form injury and staying focused, I think thats been the hardest part and Ive got it done so Im proud of that.
I keep telling these young ones, Ill never let you guys beat me, its never going to happen.
Im getting older, Im slowing down, thats why I need to get out of the sport.
The 29-year-old is hoping to pull off the triple triple. He won individual gold in the 100m and 200m in Beijing and London, and was a member of Jamaicas victorious 4x100m relay team at both those Olympics, giving him six golds from two Games.
Gold in the 200m in Rio has kept that dream alive, and with the relay to come on the weekend, we could be bowing down to him yet again before the Games are over. (news.com.au)

Wanted SL terror suspect living as Canadian citizen
	
An internationally wanted Sri Lankan accused of terrorist activities is living just outside the Greater Toronto Area (GTA) as a Canadian citizen, CTV Toronto reported on Thursday.
It said the case raises questions about the weight of Interpol notices as well as how the Canadian government deals with people they believe belong to terror groups.
The CTV Toronto had received a tip that a man named in an Interpol red notice may be living in the GTA.
The red notice was issued in 2010 for the then-43-year-old Sri Lankan named Ravishankar Kanagarajah. The notice currently on Interpol's website lists the wanted party as Kanagaraja Ravishankar. His charges are listed as "Terrorism" and he is wanted by authorities in Sri Lanka.
According to media Ravishankar was convicted and sentenced in absentia to 30 years imprisonment for transporting guns and explosives from North Korea to Sri Lanka for the LTTE in 2014. The LTTE has been considered a terrorist entity by the Canadian government since 2006.
A man living under the slightly different name of Ravisangar Kanagarajah is listed as the director of Siya Shipping Company Ltd.
According to several people found at the Brampton address listed for the company, Kanagarajah used to live at there, but recently moved to the Cambridge area.
A woman who identified herself as Kanagarajah's sister-in-law confirmed Monday Kanagarajah currently lives in her Kitchener home, along with his brother-in-law, having recently separated from his wife in Brampton. Several attempts to reach Kanagarajah, however, were unsuccessful. According to his brother-in-law and sister-in-law, he was driving a transport truck and unreachable when CTV Toronto showed up at his Kitchener home twice this week.
CTV Toronto was ultimately put in touch with his attorney, human rights lawyer Paul Copeland.
Copeland, as well as family members, confirmed Kanagarajah is the man listed in the Interpol red notice and is currently a Canadian citizen. It is unknown under what circumstances Kanagarajah was granted citizenship.
"He's a Canadian citizen, he's here lawfully, I've never heard an allegation that he used a different name," Copeland said.
According to Copeland, the Canadian government attempted to revoke Kanagarajah's passport in recent years, in part due to the Interpol red notice, but ultimately halted the process because Kanagarajah's passport had expired.
Copeland argued that Kanagarajah does not amount to a terrorist, nor should he be considered a threat to the Canadian public.
"I think the civil war in Sri Lanka did not fit within the definition of terrorism, generally speaking," Copeland said. "I would not regard him (Kanagarajah) as a terrorist."
Meanwhile, the Citizenship and Immigration Canada refused to comment on any aspect of Kanagarajah's case citing Privacy Laws. Terrorism-related convictions are grounds for citizenship revocation in Canada.
