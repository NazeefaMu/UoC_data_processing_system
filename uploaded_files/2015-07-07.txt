DEW?s claim: Ranil says breach of Privilege
	
	Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe today said former Chairman of the Committee on Public Enterprises (COPE) D. E. W. Gunasekera and reports in the media regarding the recent inquiry into the Bond scam had violated the Parliamentary Privileges Act
	In a letter addressed to Secretary General of Parliament Dammika Dasanayake, the Prime Minister said both Gunasekera and certain media institutions should be penalised under Section 22, Sub Section 5 for coming up with false information with regard to the report on the alleged scam.
	Mr. Wickremesinghe argued that the report, which was put out by Gunasekera recently was not the COPE Report.
	He said the document, which was given to media by the former COPE Chief was not a official report as it had not been approved by a majority of COPE members.
	Meanwhile, the Prime Minister said the license of Perpetual Treasuries as a primary dealer would be cancelled if the need arises.
	Also he revealed that he had to pull the Central Bank Governor up to ensure that bonds would be auctioned in order to maintain transparency.
	Mr. Wickremesinghe came up with this information, when he was briefed by the former COPE Members Sujeewa Senasinghe, Eran Wickramaratne and Rosy Senanayake on what took place during the COPE hearing.
	Mr. Senasinghe informed Mr. Wickremesinghe that the Central Bank Governor Arjuna Mahendran had told COPE that the Prime Minister had advised him to go for an auction.
	Also the former MPs said it was revealed at COPE hearing that someone from the Debt Department of Central Bank had informed one of the Primary dealers to make a bid as the interest rates were profitable for the dealers. (Yohan Perera and Sanath Desmond)

ComBank invites remittance recipients to double their money
	
		 		 
		 
			
Sri Lankans receiving remittances from overseas over the next two months can double their money, when they collect remittances from the Commercial Bank of Ceylon, the country?s largest private bank.
?The Bank has announced that it will pay out a million rupees in its ?Double the Value You Receive? promotion, to users of Commercial Bank ?e-Exchange? ? the Bank?s sophisticated real-time on-line money transfer service, as well as to those who use MoneyGram, Ria or Express Money remittance services.?
Recipients of remittances up to 31st August 2015 will go into a computer-conducted draw to select winners of this promotion, the Bank said. The maximum prize money to a single beneficiary will be Rs 50,000, and winners whose remittance values are Rs 50,000 or below, will double their money.
The Commercial Bank of Ceylon is one of the most active players in Sri Lanka in the field of remittances, offering customers a range of options. Remitters can send money even without having an account in the Bank. Commercial Bank has its own Business Promotion Officers (BPOs) in key markets around the world where significant numbers of Sri Lankans are employed.
?The Bank?s own e-Exchange platform is a highly secure, low cost money transfer facility which is available to remitters via a network of agents in over 50 countries. Recipients of remittances can collect proceeds from any of the Bank?s 243 branches in Sri Lanka, more than 60 of which are open even on bank holidays, and access their funds through its network of 613 ?ATMs, which is the largest cash-dispensing system owned by a single bank in the country. The Bank has also provided a facility to track the status of the e Exchange remittance online and the recipient receives a SMS alert once the remittance is received by the system.
MoneyGram is a global funds transfer service that operates an international network of approximately 256,000 agent locations, enabling people to conveniently and reliably send cash to recipients in approximately 192 countries and territories. Commercial Bank is one of the preferred MoneyGram agent networks in Sri Lanka for collection of remittances.
Ria Financial Services, the third largest money transfer company in the world, offers 140,000 agent locations via its global network in 136 countries on six continents.
Express Money has established one of the largest remittance networks in the industry, with 170,000 agent locations in 150 countries.
??As a result of our partnership with all of these international funds transfer companies, we have covered virtually every location on the planet from which someone may wish to send funds to Sri Lanka,? said Pradeep Banduwansa, Chief Manager e Banking. ?This vast global network, combined with our countrywide presence and reputation makes Commercial Bank one of the most widely used banks in Sri Lanka for collection of remittances.?

WhatsApp reunion for SL refugee siblings after 36 yrs
	
	Separated by the unrest in Sri Lanka more than three decades ago, a 72-year-old refugee reunited with his 76-year-old sister on Friday in the city, thanks to social networking mobile application WhatsApp.
	Samuel, 72, and his elder sister Gnanapoo, 76, were residents of Kandy, before the ethnic war broke out in Sri Lanka. Gnanapoo migrated to Thoothukudi after her marriage way back in 1979. Samuel was married to Salomi, 65, and the couple was living in Kandy till all hell broke loose in 1982 with the war between LTTE and the Lankan government intensified.
	The couple migrated to Tamil Nadu seeking refuge in Rameswaram in the same year with their new-born son Jesudoss. Since then, Samuel lost contact with his sister Gnanapoo. He was eking out a living by working in a church in Rameswaram.
	However, Samuel kept searching for his sister all these years and visited Thoothukudi often but in vain. Jesudoss, son of Samuel who is now 36-years-old, said he frequently visited Thoothukudi and Tirunelveli along with his father in search of his aunty.
	"My aunty was married to Rasayya, a merchant from Thoothukudi, after falling in love during his frequent visit to Kandy. Though we were living in the same state for over three decades, we could not meet each other with any means of communication," he said.
	During a recent visit to Sri Lanka, Samuel showed the photograph of his sister to Salomi's relatives who gave mobile numbers of some people in Thoothukudi.
	"We shared the photograph of our aunty along with a message to the mobile numbers through Whatsapp. Fortunately, the message reached my aunt's family who immediately called us," Jesudoss said.
	"We had a grand reunion of our families on Friday in Trichy where my father met his elder sister after a gap of 36 years," Jesudoss said. (Times of India)

	The appearance of cracks on some of the frescoes, signals an imminent danger to this world heritage site. In certain frescoes the original paint appears to be peeling off. This is more evident in a fresco which was not subject to the waste oil attack some time back. The Mirror wall is constantly subject to droppings of the swallows who nest inside the caves of the rock fortress.
	Making matters worse the large number of visitors who flock to this site walk on the ancient brick walls flouting the many prohibition notices put up within the site for preservation of this site.
	The use of powerful flash lights from the highly sophisticated cameras by both local and foreign visitors at the gallery of the frescoes continues regardless despite the inconvenience to those who visit the site to view the frescoes admiring its beauty and texture. Attempts by the security guards of the Archaeology Department has become futile.
	Incidents of misbehaviour by people under the influence of liquor had also being a major concern for the security personnel.
	It appears that the security provided at this site is inadequate leaving much to be desired. The authorities seems to be only concerned with the issue of admission tickets and checking them and not delegating responsibility in maintaining this historical site .
	Attempts to contact the Archaeology Director General Dr. Senarath Dissanayake and the Sigiriya Project Manager had been unsuccessful.
	Central Cultural Fund Director General Prof. Prishantha Gunawardane said he was aware this matter. He said he would take steps to evolve a programme to conserve the heritage site. (K.K. Ariyadasa)Pix by K.K. Ariyadasa

UNP exposes MR?s Rs. 9.4 m unpaid 5-star breakfast bill
	
	The United National Party (UNP) yesterday revealed that former President Mahinda Rajapaksa?s family had ordered breakfast worth Rs. 9.4 million from the Hilton and not paid the bill.
	Former UNP MP Nalin Bandara addressing the ?expose? media briefing at Sirikotha claimed that former Secretary to the President Lalith Weeratunga had signed this order instead of ex-President Rajapaksa.
	?Former President Rajapaksa and his family have spent Rs. 9,481,502 for a breakfast and they did not pay it back.
	This bill was dated 1 November 2013. We are wondering about the way they spent public funds for their family needs,? Bandara charged.
	Bandara further said that the Government had not taken a final decision on whether to pay this bill.
	?The Government did not come to a conclusion about paying this bill. However we exposed this bill to create awareness among the public of how Rajapaksa and his family misused public funds for their entertainment needs. We will reveal more secret information about the past regime, most of them about fraud and crimes,? he asserted.
	Bandara also said that anyone could take legal action against the UNP if they could prove these allegations were wrong.
	?We have written evidences about some major frauds that happened under the past Government. We will expose them one by one. Former President Rajapaksa or anyone can take legal action against the UNP if these are incorrect. They can call us to a debate too. We challenge them to do so,? Bandara said.

Video: Dhanuna to contest with SF
	
Dhanuna Thilakaratne, who was mired in controversy during the last Presidential Election, would contest at the upcoming General Elections from the Democratic Party led by Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka.
Speaking to the Daily Mirror Thilakarathne said that he had decided to contest the elections in order to strengthen the Democratic Party as it lacked a second tier.
?I will contest from Colombo East in order to strengthen the Democratic Party led by Field Marshall Sarath Fonseka and intend winning the seat,? he said.
He said that he intended on increasing the present vote base of the party.
?The party received close to 98,000 votes during the previous election and I intend improving this further.?
Thilakarathne earlier was married to the eldest daughter of Fonseka with whom he separated recently.He was also accused and indicted in many cases under the previous regime and was in hiding until his re- emergence in December last year.
In an interview with the Daily Mirror Thilakarathne said he was a part of a witch hunt of the previous regime and was compelled to evade arrest.
When questioned about nominations being granted to former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, Thilakarathne remained philosophical.
?I oppose nominations being given to him. But if nominations are given to him they should stop slandering him and accusing him. You can?t accuse him and grant nominations both at the same time,? he said. (Sanath Desmond)
