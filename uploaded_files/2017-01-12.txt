Buddha?s historic visit to Sri Lanka
	
?Vadinu Mena Nidukaanani !:We are on the Brink of Annihilation, a fourth visit is Paramount.
When the Duruthu full moon spreads its radiant light over the island of Sri Lanka, we celebrate Buddha?s momentous first visit to the island twenty five centuries ago. Today, this beautiful land is free of Yakkas and Nagas but faces an imminent threat from one evil tribe known as Politikkas. ??
?
The first Full Moon Poya Day of the year, in the month of Duruthu is the beginning of adhering to the teachings of Buddhism in the island. Nine months after his Enlightenment [528 B.C.] Buddha visited Mahiyangana in the Uva Province for a noble purpose: To restore peace by dispelling war and violence. ??
??Our thrice-blessed nation does not possess a genuine politician anymore; sadly we have come to a state where when we are casting our votes we have to see who has least robbed and done more....at times I wonder the British should?ve continued their rule over here? ? courtesy-Comments by Daily Mirror readers

?On this visit the Yakka Clan, the whole island assembled in the Mahanaga Garden. The purpose of this historic visit was to bring about unity among the two main tribes who were in constant confrontation because of the interminable quarrel for power. Some believe that Sumana Saman implored Buddha to end this strife and restore peace and it was for this purpose that the Buddha arrived at the Mahanaga Grove. The Buddha not only won the Yakkas/Raksas to the Dhamma but also succeeded in getting the Naga clan King Maniakkhika, who visited the Buddha in Mahiyangana to convert to Buddhism. A Dagoba with a few strands of hair [Kesa Dhathu] of the Buddha enshrined in it was put up at the instance of a Prince named Mahasumana of Deva Clan. This Stupa, after the passing away of the Buddha was transformed to be the Mahiyangana Chaitiya. Following Buddha?s deathin 543BC, the collar bone relic or Greeva Dhathu which was recovered from the funeral pyre was brought to Sri Lanka by Arahant Sarabha Thera. This too was enshrined in the newly enlarged Mahiyangana Raja Maha Vihara. ?
?This monument enters the annals of this country?s history as the first Dagoba built in Sri Lanka. The Blessed One sermonized the message of peaceful coexistence to those who gathered to listen to him. They say Sumana attained Sovan at the end of the discourse [the first of the four stages that lead to Nibbana]. ??

Merit Transfer- Mahayana or a Theravada Concept? ??
??Acts of merit? bring Joy and contentment to the doer in this world and in the next. ??
? As a stream must flow and reach and fill the far-away main, ?
?what is given here will reach and consecrate the spirits. ?
?Water poured on mountain top would soon tumble down and fill the plain ?
?like what is given here will get to and bless the feelings there.? ?
?
?--Nidhikanda Sutta ??
?Some Western scholars of Buddhism, believed that the transfer of merit was a Mahayana concept developed at a late period and that it was rather discordant with Buddhist perceptions of karma theory. Heinz Bechert, believes the doctrine in its developed form to an era between the 6th and 7th centuries. However, Anthony Barber differs in his views, says, ?merit transfer was an integral part of Buddhism practised from Buddhas times in India. Buddhism teaches that the accumulated merit can be transferred, can be shared with others; it is reversible and the persons who receive can be either living or dead.? ?
The mode of transfer is quite simple; the doer has merely to wish that the merit he/she has gained accumulate to somebody in particular, or to ?all beings?, a wish purely mental or expressed by words. All actions, according to the Buddha, what really matters is thought. Transference is mainly an act of the mind. Tirokuddha Sutta ? Khuddakapatha says, there is no use in weeping, lamenting, feeling sorry and bewailing; such approaches are of no consequence to the departed ones. Some simply waste on meaningless rituals and performances in remembrance of departed ones. They do not realize that it is not possible to help the dead simply by constructing graveyards, tombs, Monuments and other paraphernalia; instead doing some meritorious acts like building orphanages , schools, temples, libraries, hospitals, or distributing religious books and other numerous related charitable deeds. ?
?
Milindapanha?
?In the Milindapanha the King Milinda conveys the idea that if the recipient is not mindful of a gift of merit being presented, the giver gets no advantage thereby. Naagasena quotes a few examples to prove that is wrong. The disagreement is that the act of transfer is an act of selflessness and the feedback of the action on oneself has a cleansing effect, as well as on the individual to whom the act is aimed at. Naagasena tells Milinda, ?If a person transfer merit, that merit develops and grows more and more, during the act of transferring it, and the merit of that performance he is able to distribute to whomsoever he will.? ?
?In the Theravada tradition rebirth is an immediate happening after a person?s death, so transfer of merit as performed, cannot rationally be of any advantage to the deceased person. He would have to shoulder the weight for the kamma that is owing to him. The transfer of merit for a deceased will though benefit the giver as it should make a sense of loving kindness in that person. ?
?
Merit Transfer with Carcasses of innocent Animals brutally Slaughtered ?
?Whatever the arguments may say, in transferring merit to dead, the most popularly practised ritual is by inviting Maha Sangha to the residence of the deceased on the seventh day and on completion of the third month followed by on a yearly basis on the death anniversary, along with a large gathering of relatives, friends and neighbours. A large majority use huge quantities of carcasses of innocent animals brutally slaughtered for food in preparation of dishes for the Bikkhus and lay devotees to satisfy their palatal greed. ??
How do they know, or what makes them sure that the carcass of the seer fish that they bought encouraging the slaughterer to kill more next day and make those sumptuous deep fried slices does not belong to their loved one who died a few years ago and reborn an aquatic animal? They now enjoy the flesh along with the high priest of the very temple the deceased was a Dhayake and a host of friends and relatives joining them.?
Let me conclude with an anecdote, which goes as, the fisher folk in the village invited the Village Headman and his wife for a meal at his residence. Presenting two dishes of fish of two different varieties to the virtuous man and mentioning the name of the variety, he said, ?Sir, this one I caught especially for you?, and vice versa. The Headman, avaricious though realize the folly. If he eats, it becomes obvious that it is not ?thricotica parisudda? and as such the noble man he, would be committing a sin. Witty man rejoined, ?I say, you serve this to my wife, and let me have the one which you killed especially for her.? ??
Are there loop-holes in the Dhamma as discovered and preached by the Blessed one? ?May all beings be happy!

CBK'S 2000 Constitution: UNP rejected as it created 'Union of regions': Rajitha
	
Responding to former President Chandrika?s Kumaratinga?s claim today that the UNP did not support her constitutional reform programme in 2000, cabinet spokesman, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said the UNP rejected it because the draft constitution in 2000 had proposed to create a ?Union of Regions? which is extreme power devolution going even beyond the federal system.
Addressing the weekly cabinet news briefing yesterday, Minister Senaratne said another atrocious proposal was inserting a clause surreptitiously by the then Constitutional Affairs Minister Prof. G.L. Peiris to extend the term of office President Kumaratunga by another two years.
?The UNP or the SLFP have not agreed ever for a federal system of governance and change their stance on the unitary character of the state. But both parties led by President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe are agreeable for power devolution as a final solution to the north-east issue based on these principles.
Both parties have never disagreed not to devolve power to provinces while honouring of the guiding principles of the 1970 and 1978 Constitutions,? Minister Senaratne stressed.
Responding to a journalist, Minister Senaratne reiterated that two main parties of the unity government, the UNP and the SLFP were also for the abolition of the Executive Presidency as pledged by both during the Presidential and Parliamentary elections in January 2015 and August 2015 respectively.
Both parties cannot depart from this pledge and President Sirisena is determined to do that. He wanted to prune all executive powers from the 19th Amendment but the Supreme Court ruled otherwise, Minister Senaratne added.
Minister Senaratne also said the SLFP Central Committee (CC) has not decided to continue with the Executive Presidency but discussed the matter. However, President Sirisena is not interested in not to abolish the executive powers of the President. (Sandun A Jaysekera)

Country did not suffer without GSP+: MR
	
Saying that it was good to regain the GSP+ facility, former president Mahinda Rajapaksa said yesterday that the country had not been adversely affected by losing the facility.
?It is good to regain the GSP+ facility. It is good if they think the country will benefit from it. We did not suffer any loss even without it,? he said.
Mr. Rajapaksa told the media, after he visited former minister Wimal Weerawansa in Welikada prison, that he had met the Chinese Ambassador yesterday and discussed the government?s move to hand over land in Hambantota to a Chinese company.
?I met the Chinese Ambassador and had cordial discussion about the taking over of ancestral lands belonging to the people of Hambantota. He listened attentively and we hope it will be successful,? he said.
?This protest is not against China; it is against the government taking over land occupied by the people. I requested the Chinese government to invest in Sri Lanka and send Chinese tourists here when I visited China,? he said. (Ajith Siriwardana)

Misuse of state vehicles: Marasinghe must be arrested first: NFF
	
United National Party (UNP) MP Ashu Marasinghe, a former chairman of the State Engineering Corporation, should have been arrested first if the alleged misuse of 40 state vehicles by opposition MP Wimal Weerawansa is true, National Freedom Front (NFF) said today.
NFF media spokesman Mohammed Muzammil said the FCID had arrested Mr. Weerawansa without any written evidence other than a complaint by Mr. Marasinghe.
?We condemn Mr. Weerawansa's arrest. The UNP is attempting to highlight the fact that several of his relatives were also engaged in this vehicle scam causing a Rs.90 million loss to the state. But they have not revealed the actual facts on the case,? he said.
He said the ?Jana Sevana? housing project was carried out in seven stages and with the support of several close political allies and family members, journalists and the clergy.
?A majority were our relatives who did their best to make the project a success without any benefits for themselves. They have been provided vehicle facilities to complete the project,? Mr. Muzammil said.
He said Mr. Weerawansa had been remanded with the help of the FCID to serve political agendas.(Kalathma Jayawardhane)

My life in relation to the concept of death, dying and suffering
	
?
?
When I came home from the hospital after I was born, she was there to greet me into my new home. She was my elder sister and best friend. She would refuse letting anyone come near my cot and start talking. After many years while I was still a child, I still remember that fateful day. I was watching a cartoon in the hall. I suddenly noticed my father kneeling on the ground holding her in his arms. I knew something was wrong. I ran to my father and was just in time to see her breathing her last. I had never cried like I did on that day to feel that she was no more was hard to comprehend. My best friend had gone. ?
Her name was Puggy and she was my grandparents? pet dachshund. Puggy?s was the first death I ever witnessed in my life. I still remember when I was crying, how my mother comforted me. She was crying too, however, she said just one sentence and that calmed me. She said ?Nami, we?ll get you another pup?. That was all she said. Maybe it was the comforting tone of her voice, I immediately accepted the fact that Puggy had died. I cried a couple of times after that but all in all I had accepted that Puggy had moved on. ?
The next death I witnessed was that of my Nanny?s. She passed away about two weeks before I met my then future husband. Unfortunately she didn?t live to see my husband. She was always saying how much she wanted to see what my future husband looked like. She was my Millie Acchie. ??
Millie Acchie died of cancer in the bladder. She would pass blood with her urine and was most often in utter pain. It was very hard for me to see her suffering. However, the worst was over soon and she passed on. The moment she died, I was at my own home giving a cello lesson when the power went out. So I, together with my little pupil went to the back verandah to get on with the lesson. We were about to start the lesson when I saw the most breathtaking of sights. Sunlight was streaming from a point above me up in the sky, filling the back garden with light. I don?t have the words to describe it. The sunlight filled the verandah with light. I like to think it was Millie Acchi?s way of saying her final goodbye to me. I believe she must have been born as a deva, if not a very good human birth. ??
The next person who died in my life was my grandfather. He lived a good long life and somehow, I was able to accept his death, unlike my father?s. When my father died, I never imagined the extent to which I was bound to grieve. I suffered like never before after his death. I would choke with sadness whenever I remembered him and would find it so hard to bear that I had even been off food. ??
Death is such a mysterious thing. People you see everyday walking talking eating sleeping, suddenly no more in your life. When we love a person, although he or she has passed on, the love one bore for that person never really dies. It always remains. But one has to invariably suffer the consequence of grief. And that is something extremely hard to endure. ?
While I write this, I am seated at a restaurant overlooking the beautiful blue sea in Negombo. I can?t help remembering all those who died in the tsunami and what a tragedy that was! ?
My own parents happened to have been at the beach that fateful morning, and I dread to think the worst that could have happened in my life that day. My life would have taken a tragic turn if I had lost both of them. They had seen that the shoreline had receded into the sea in an unnatural way however, and had not thought anything much beyond that. They left the beach just in time before the first giant waves hit. ??
After my A/Levels, I did social work at the cancer hospital in Maharagama for a year. My grandmother and some friends would go every Wednesday morning in a van to the hospital and distribute rations like tea, milk powder and sugar to the poor patients. And also piping hot tea to drink, hand carried in kettles. I used to go with them and help them in this task. I also would, from time to time, visit the hospice and spend some time with the terminal patients there. Doing this job for that one year really made me happy. I did what I could in my own way. ?
Death is such a tangible reality. There isn?t a single person in this world who has not known a person who has died in their own family or social network. And so many people all over the world grieve after the loss of loved ones. After my father died, I questioned so many things in my life and in the lives of others. I got to know the true meaning of grief after my father passed away. There were deaths in the family before that like I mentioned. My grandfather for example whom I was very close to. However, I accepted my grandfather?s death and moved on. When my father passed away, I suffered tremendously, I never knew how bad it would get. ??
Death is one form of suffering. Both for the one who dies and for the ones left behind to grieve. However, there are so many other types of suffering. I?d see so much suffering around me and it would be unbearable. I would be moved to tears by empathy. In fact, after my father?s death, I am now able to feel for others in a way I never did before. I am able to empathise with all those who have lost a loved one, or loved ones. ?
In the context of other forms of suffering, if my own son is hungry for a meal while we are travelling somewhere, I would cry together with him. I could feel his hunger, I could feel his pain. When I commute on the roads, I would often see beggars begging and I would be so moved, I wouldn?t go past them without giving them something. A few rupees or even a meal at times. But I see so many people, passing people in need without offering them as little as a glance, and I would wonder why couldn?t people help the needy. Those who could make a difference and contribute. Why do they pass by people in need. Cripples really move me. I find it hard to even look at a cripple and at times would end up tearing when I saw one. ?
Life is short. We are here for a little while. What is the use of our lives if we haven?t helped others. At the end of my life, I would have these questions. How well did I live? How well did I love? How well did I give. ??
I have always considered myself to be a loving person. However, after my father?s death, love took on a new meaning. Earlier, I would simply love others. However, now, I feel so much more for people. I am apprehensive that every single person I know and associate, is going to die one day. My loved ones, as well as my own self; this is a very humbling thought. ?
I now sense suffering in such a strong way more than I ever did. The pain of others is my own pain. Their sorrows are my sorrows. Their hurt is my hurt. I would do anything to help anyone who is suffering in any way.

## Title: Official recognition of Buddhism in non-Buddhist countries

Official recognition of Buddhism in non-Buddhist countries
	
?
?
This is an edited version of an address delivered by Senaka Weeraratna, Hony. Secretary of the German Dharmaduta Society, on September 28, 2016 in support of his resolution entitled ?Recognition of Buddhism as an official religion in non ? Buddhist countries? at the First Plenary Session of the 28th General Conference of the World Fellowship of Buddhists (WFB) held in Seoul, South Korea from September 26 to 30, 2016. ?
The WFB being the leading international Buddhist Organisation, was founded by a great visionary, Dr. G.P. Malalasekera, in 1950 in Colombo to unite all Buddhists despite glaring ideological differences among the various traditions, under the umbrella of ?Fellowship?. ?
There were 129 Buddhist delegates from 27 countries representing Asia, Europe and North America (including Hawaii) at this historic meeting which saw the founding of the WFB. It is now generally accepted that this meeting marked the first event in Buddhist history when Buddhists (laity and Sangha) of nearly all sects in the globe were duly represented. ??
Among the notable figures present on this occasion was Dr. B.R. Ambedkar, the then Minister of Law and Chairman of the Drafting Committee of India?s Constitution (also known as the father of India?s Constitution and regarded by some as the ?Modern Manu?. More importantly he was greatly instrumental in the revival of Buddhism in India in the modern era being the leader of India?s Dalits (so-called untouchables) who converted to Buddhism. ?
?
Ambedkar?s advice to WFB
In the Book ?Ambedkar and Buddhism? by Sangarakshita (1986), an interesting account is given of his stance at the inaugural meeting of the WFB which took place at the Dalada Maligawa (Temple of the Tooth) in Kandy on May 25, 1950. Sangarakshita says as follows:
?
? On 25 May, (1950) he ( Dr. B.R. Ambedkar) arrived in Colombo by air with his wife and Rajbhoj and the same day attended the inaugural meeting of the World Fellowship of Buddhists at the Temple of the Tooth in Kandy. Since he was not attending the meeting as a Delegate (for that would have implied that he considered himself a Buddhist), he declined to speak at the official session and, instead, addressed the delegates after they had adopted the resolution inaugurating the fellowship. There were people in India, he told them, who thought that the time had come when the effort might be made to revive Buddhism, and one of the objects of his visit was to observe Buddhist ceremonies and rituals, which the people of India had no means of witnessing.
??
Having thus explained the purpose of his visit, Ambedkar turned to the conference itself. He was not fully satisfied, he said, with the resolution that had been passed calling for a World Fellowship of Buddhists. What was wanted was a declaration on the part of all the Buddhist countries that they were determined not merely to have a Fellowship but that they would propagate the religion and make sacrifices for it. Whether the delegates realized it or not, what Ambedkar was really saying was that the Buddhist countries of Asia should be less inward-looking and more outward-looking. He himself was, as usual, sufficiently outward-looking. ??
After the conclusion of the inaugural WFB conference, Dr. Ambedkar not only saw as much as he could of the ceremonies and rituals of Buddhism in Sri Lanka,but found time to address the Young Men?s Buddhist Association, Colombo, on ?The Rise and Fall of Buddhism in India?. Buddhism had not totally disappeared from India, he asserted. Though its material form had disappeared, as a spiritual force it still existed in India and commanded respect, he said. Suitable evidence of acknowledgement of major Buddhist influence in Indian History, is the inclusion of the Asoka Chakra being a depiction of the Buddhist Dharmachakra which appears at the centre of the Flag of India. It also appears on a number of Edicts of Asoka most prominent among which is the Lion Capital of Ashoka. ??
Dr. Ambedkar?s advice to the WFB was that it must not confine itself to mere ?fellowship? but instead WFB must be forthright and determined to make sacrifices in fostering (and protecting Buddhism), and have an impact on the unfolding major events in the world. ??
?
Protection of Buddha Gaya
Today, there are threats even to the sanctity of the Maha Bodhi Temple at Buddha Gaya. It is subject to constant disturbance from sound amplifiers i.e. loudspeakers, installed at a nearby Mosque situated only 60 metres away from the Maha Bodhi Temple. The tranquillity and serenity that one associates with the most sacred place on earth for Buddhists i.e. place of enlightenment of the Buddha, is not possible due to management of the Temple not being under the control of Buddhists. It is tantamount to humiliation of Buddhists to be forced to listen as a captive audience to shrieking sounds in a foreign language amplified many times over in the most sacred site for Buddhists. The Govt. of India which has taken special steps to attract tourists from all over the world to visit important Buddhist sites in India must address this issue on an urgent and serious footing without any further delay. WFB must add its voice and urge the Govt. of India to act effectively to put a stop to highly amplified sounds of another Religion that disturbs the tranquillity and calm of the main Maha Bodhi Temple at Buddha Gaya. ?
Official recognition of Buddhism in non-Buddhist majority countries
The resolution before this House is a call to the WFB to lobby the international community to extend official recognition to Buddhism in countries outside Asia. ??
It is estimated that there are now altogether between 1 and 4 million Buddhists in Europe, the majority being in Germany, Italy, France and the United Kingdom. Despite a commitment to ?multi-culturalism? and ?religious pluralism? in Europe, the official recognition of Buddhism is confined only to two States i.e. Russia and Austria. ? ?
In most Islamic countries in West Asia, the existence of Buddhism as a religion is denied because it does not subscribe to the belief in a creator God. This translates itself into denial of any form of freedom of worship, including access to places of worship for Buddhists in the Middle East despite over one million expatriate Buddhists working and living in these countries. In some Islamic countries, including Maldives, Buddhists are not allowed to enter these countries with books on Buddhism or any artefact that resembles affinity or respect for Buddhism, such as Buddhist statues. In some airports they are pulled out from the possession of the foreign visitor by customs officials and dashed to the ground. This is a clear violation of a fundamental human rights. The right to choose one?s religion and practise it. Many international bodies, including the UNHRC, are complicit tacitly in such human rights violations through conduct of omission and deafening silence. ??
However, in contrast to the practice of countries in the Middle East, several Islamic majority countries in South East Asia i.e. Indonesia and Malaysia, and South Asia, such as Bangladesh have given official recognition to Buddhism and declared Vesak as a public holiday. ??
Pakistan officially recognizes Buddhism and held the first ever Vesak Festival organized by the Government of Pakistan at Taxila commencing in year 2016. ??
In Europe, so far only Russia and Austria, have granted official recognition to Buddhism, despite Buddhism being one of the oldest religions and accepted as a global religion by the UN which has allocated a special day in its annual calendar for celebration of Vesak (Buddha?s birth anniversary). ??
The non-recognition of Buddhism as an official religion in Europe has led to discriminatory treatment such as categorizing Buddhists as being members of ?sects? and ?cults? among other things. The absence of State recognition to Buddhism in almost all European countries functions as an impediment to the proper practice and development of Buddhism in Europe. ?
There are no public holidays for Buddhism or any other non-Christian religion in the public holiday calendar of European nations with Christian heritage. This is in stark contrast to the conduct of traditional Buddhist countries e.g. Sri Lanka, which has granted public holidays on days of religious significance to adherents of both Abrahamic and Eastern Dharmic religions. ?
Even UK denies official recognition to Buddhism. It does not allow the construction of new Buddhist Temples. But allows Buddhists to occupy existing buildings and use them for their religious functions. This is also true of several other West European countries. ?
?
What does official State recognition of Buddhism mean?
Official recognition would allow Buddhists certain rights such as access to the media, financial support, legal standing, and recognition equal to those of Christian Churches, and right to teach in a school. It would allow them the legal right to form voluntary societies as exclusive Buddhist societies with membership restricted only to Buddhists. ?
However, despite restrictive laws, there is growing public acceptance and accommodation of Buddhism in several European countries including UK, France and Germany. ?
?
No mechanism to protect and save Buddhist communities
If we look at the world today we see powerful and influential organizations like the ?Organisation for Islamic Cooperation? and ?World Council of Christian Churches? who would stand by and publicly support the cause of their co-religionists unequivocally. Leading Buddhist organizations must do likewise. We must evolve mechanisms to help protect and save Buddhist communities and Buddhist Nations in danger. The protection and preservation of Buddhism must be placed high on the WFB Agenda. This is because it is Buddhism more than any other religion that has lost more ground and space to other religions during the last 1000 years. ??
The WFB must take leadership in association with the Governments of Buddhism-friendly countries and other Buddhist organizations and Buddhist communities, in lobbying for greater official recognition of Buddhism by nations outside Asia. Buddhists in these countries are entitled to equal rights similar to those enjoyed by the followers of the Abrahamic faiths. ??

Racial abuse causes Lankan teen's life in Netherlands
	
The Netherlands Police have arranged extra protection for the Grotius College and its school grounds in Heerlen after a Sri Lankan-born student committed suicide because of alleged attempts of bullying and harassment, NL Times reported on Thursday.
The College's director, teachers and students had received threats in response to the suicide of the 15-year-old Sri Lankan student Tharukshan Selvam on Sunday, AD reports.
a
According to NL Times, Tharukshan died during the early hours of Sunday morning.
His family published his suicide note, in which he described how he was being bullied at school. He was also being harassed by anonymous social media accounts, believed to be the work of his class mates.
The Sri Lankan' teen's story provoked numerous threats and death treats addressed to the director of Grotius College, several teachers and students.
The condolence register the school opened on Wednesday was flooded with responses from across the country. "You should be deeply ashamed, students and school", "Bullies of Tharukshan: you should be deeply ashamed", "How could this happen?" and "This could have been avoided", were just some of the responses.
Frank Schings, director of school organization LVO Parkstad, under which Grotius College falls, announced that the circumstances of the boy's suicide will be investigated.
Later on Wednesday the school leaders announced in a press conference that they have asked the Inspectorates for both Education and Youth Care to investigate what happened, according to NU.nl. Heerlen Mayor Ralf Krewinkel will also investigate.
The Mayor's investigation will also look into the role of youth care and other health institutions in what happened to Tharukshan.
It is known that both school and municipality had contact with the Selvam family. According to Schings at the press conference, a municipal expertise center first spoke to Tharukshan on December 5th due to the bullying. After that the 15-year-old boy spoke to aid workers on December 28th.
Minister Jet Bussemaker of Education responded to Tharukshan's suicide on television program Jinek on Wednesday evening. She called the death of the Sri Lankan boy "heartbreaking" and called on everyone not to turn a blind eye to bullying. "Do not look away from abuses. If you notice something in your surroundings, report it, discuss it", she said. "And if you can't do so yourself, make sure that experts are involved."
Education State Secretary Sander Dekker also responded to the boy's death. "Heartbreaking. There is no other word for the suicide of 15-year-old Tharukshan from Heerlen." he wrote on his Facebook page.
According to Dekker, Tharukshan's death is reminiscent of the deaths of 20-year-old Tim Ribberink and 15-year-old Fleur Bloemen, who both committed suicide in 2012 after continuing bullying. "It shows again that the consequences of bullying can be enormous. We must always remain vigilant that it does not rear its ugly head. And we must continue to emphasize that bullying is unacceptable."
Tharukshan's family describes him as a cheerful boy who always put on a brave face for the outside world, his brother in law Mayruam Sellathurai said to De Limburger, speaking on behalf of the family. At home Tharukshan liked to listen to music, talk with his family members and play some cards. The night of his death they also played cards before going to bed. "I noticed nothing wrong with him. In fact, he was cheerful", Sellathurai said. A few hours later, Tharukshan's family found him dead in his bedroom.
The Sri Lankan family arrived in the Netherlands about six years ago. They fled Sri Lanka because of the conflict at the time, but also because the children had a better future in the Netherlands, Sellathurai said. Tharukshan went to primary school in Heerlen and quickly adjusted to life in his new home. He got good grades and made friends.
Neighborhood friend Santana, 13, confirmed this picture to the newspaper. "He came to us in group 4. He was a very nice guy, very friendly, always smiling, polite. He always got good marks, was motivated to work. Often made fun jokes, he was definitely not a quiet guy. He was friends with almost everyone because he was so nice. You just accepted him. At primary school he was not bullied. What happened now, we never expected. I saw him regularly. I ran into him, or we planned something. Also saw him often with my girlfriend. We never noticed that something was not right. He smiled through everything. We are really very shocked."
Tharukshan's family was flooded with reactions over the past days. "We are trying to get his grandmother from Sri Lanka here for a dignified farewell. He never went back to Sri Lanka. He would have gone for the first time this year, go back and visit his family in his native country during his vacation. A trip he will now never make. That hurts. His grandmother has to instead make the trip, with the memories of her grandson. She is devastated. We are too. This should never have happened." Sellathurai said to the newspaper.

Regaining GSP+ a victory for all: PM
	
"Regaining the GSP Plus facility is a victory for all Sri Lankans," said Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe yesterday.
?This is not a victory of the government alone, but a victory for all the people of Sri Lanka," he said, in a statement hours after the European Union announced last afternoon that it had decided to grant the GSP plus facility again to Sri Lanka.
He said we regained this as a result of the government's commitment to preserving human rights and democracy in the country.
He said this would help Sri Lanka gain access to many new markets across Europe and to create a large number of employment opportunities.
He thanked all those who had helped to regain the facility. (Yohan Perera)

## Title: UN resolution on SL remains largely unimplemented: HRW

UN resolution on SL remains largely unimplemented: HRW
	
SL promised to have a special court integrating foreign judges
	Senior govt. members issue contradictory statements
	There are some progress on cases 
	Govt. engages with int?l community unlike previous hostile govt.
	Media, CSOs enjoy freedom from harassment
Though the Sri Lankan Government was able to report progress on certain aspects and sought technical expertise from the UN and other countries, the UN Human Rights Council resolution adopted in October 2015 on the country remained largely unimplemented, the Human Rights Watch (HRW) on Thursday said.
The international nongovernmental human rights organization included these remarks in its 27th World Report, a review of human rights around the globe, which was launched by the organisation?s Executive Director Kenneth Roth in Washington DC, US on Thursday.
From the report, the HRW said Sri Lanka pledged to undertake many human rights reforms, including resolving the many transitional justice demands arising out of the civil war.
?From the UN resolution, Sri Lanka promised to establish four transitional justice mechanisms, including a special court integrating international judges, prosecutors, lawyers and investigators with an independent investigative and prosecuting body. The resolution also called for an office on missing and disappeared persons, a truth-telling mechanism, and a mechanism designed to guarantee non-recurrence and reparations,? it said.
The UN Commissioner for Human Rights, Zeid Ra?ad al-Hussein, who visited the country, called for speedier implementation of the resolution, for greater efforts at confidence-building with the minority populations and the need for international participation in transitional justice mechanisms.
The report said the senior government members continued to issue contradictory statements on the need to have international participation in the four transitional justice mechanisms, with the President and Prime Minister both claiming these would be wholly domestic processes, contrary to the Human Rights Council resolution.
However, the report said the new Sri Lankan government continued to engage with the international community unlike the previous ?hostile? government, with key actors such as the US and European Union voicing cautious optimism regarding the government?s efforts to implement the 2015 Human Rights Council resolution.
Meanwhile, it said the Sri Lankan Government had not only failed to abolish the draconian Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA), it?s unwillingness to consult adequately before enacting legislation to establish the Office of Missing Persons (OMP) has damaged public trust during the transitional justice process.
Referring to alleged incidents of torture in police custody, the watchdog said Sri Lankan police are not held accountable for routine torture and ill-treatment of individuals taken into custody.
?Sometimes torture is carried out to extract confessions, but it is also used for personal vendettas or to extort funds. Police often used methods designed to leave no visible marks, suggesting a level of institutionalization,? it said adding Sri Lanka appeared before the UN?s Commission Against Torture in November and denied allegations of torture and abuse.
The report highlighted that more than 1 million Sri Lankans are employed overseas, mostly in the Middle East, and many remained at risk of abuse at every stage of the migration cycle.
It further said state and non-state discrimination and abuses against the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex (LGBTI) population also continued in Sri Lanka.
?Sections 365 and 365A of the Sri Lankan Penal Code prohibit ?carnal knowledge against the order of nature? and ?gross indecency,? commonly understood in Sri Lanka to criminalize all same-sex relations between consenting adults,? the report said.
Allegations of sexual and other violence committed against women during the civil war are expected to be addressed through the transitional justice mechanisms, although there are concerns that many women will be reluctant to come forward due to the lack of an independent victim and witness protection program, the HRW said.
?Although the government, elected in January 2015, did not deliver all reformist promises made during the election campaign, media and civil society organizations (CSO) in the country largely enjoyed continued freedom from surveillance, harassment, and attacks. A long-promised Right to Information bill was enacted in June 2016. There was some progress on emblematic cases linked to the civil war, such as the murder of a prominent newspaper editor, the enforced disappearance of a political cartoonist, and the killing of five youths by state security forces in the eastern district of Trincomalee,? the report said commenting on Sri Lanka.

We have clear consensus on domestic mechanism: Mangala
	
Even though there were divergent views within the government regarding the participation of foreign judges in the proposed judicial mechanism, there was a clear consensus across the board on the need of an independent and credible domestic mechanism as promised by the manifesto of President Maithripala Sirisena, Foreign Minister Mangala Samaraweera said.
Speaking on the Sri Lanka's reconciliation process at Chatham House, he said as a democratic and sovereign government, Sri Lanka would work out the architecture of such a mechanism in consultation with all the stake holders.
?Although the violence ended in May 2009, the healing of wounds of over two decades of conflict, achieving reconciliation and national integration, catching up on economic progress and development that eluded us due to conflict, and ensuring non-recurrence, remain challenging tasks for our Nation.? Similarly, the tasks of improving governance, institutions, rule of law, and putting in place necessary measures to strengthen, promote and protect individual rights; while ensuring the dignity of all and building a truly national identity while preserving our pluralistic society ? remain work in progress,? he said.
He said Sri Lanka was committed to the implementation of the resolution which was co-sponsored by Sri Lanka in 2015 so that as a country Sri Lanka could deal with the past honestly and truthfully, accept that past, put it behind us, and then move forward to build our Sri Lankan nation anew.
?The content of the Resolution is based on commitments that we ourselves as a Government, made to our people, and proposals that we presented to the Council based on the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission Report, the Paranagama Commission Report and advice of our experts,? he said.
Mr. Sasaraweera said that? Missing Persons was a phenomenon that had plagued Sri Lanka for long years and that apart from steps being taken to set up the permanent Office on Missing Persons, Sri Lanka had? also become parties to the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance.

Woman dies after drinking concoction made by exorcist

The exorcist had given the woman some sort of liquid to drink saying it was from the gods while chanting. Thereafter, she had fallen ill according to preliminary investigations conducted by the police.
The exorcist had been taken into custody by the Dummalasuriya Police and was due to be produced in court. (Dinesh Upendra)
