4000 Indian fishermen go to sea after ban ends; SL Navy vessels on IMBL
	
	About 4000 Indian fishermen on Saturday set out to sea at the end of a 48-day ban, imposed to enable fish breeding, even as Sri Lankan Navy deployed its vessels along the International Maritime Boundary Line (IMBL) to prevent them from crossing over into their waters.
	Speaking to PTI, Assistant Director of Fisheries (Ramanthapuram district) Gobinath said officials have warned the fishermen against crossing the IMBL. Severe action would be taken against those who had left town without obtaining the required permission, he said.
	Gopinath said the Lankan Navy has deployed some ships and more than 10 naval boats along IMBL to prevent the fishermen from crossing over into their territorial waters. The Indian Coast Guard had also deployed sufficient force in the area to advice fishermen not to cross the IMBL. So far all of them have been fishing in Indian waters, he said.
	Meanwhile, Military spokesperson Brigadier Jayanath Jayaweera speaking to Daily Mirror said that sufficient Navy personnel had been deployed along the IMBL and the number of personnel will be increased when the most number of Indian fishermen tend to cross the IMBL. If they crossed into tour territorial waters, they would be arrested, he said.(DS)

Fleeing casualties succumbs to wounds in trishaw mishap
	
One person was found dead with two others passed out with serious injuries in a badly damaged trishaw on the Elakanda Road in Wattala this afternoon when the daring trio proceeded without stopping after the accident.
The residents in Elakanda found a heavily damaged trishaw parked in the middle of the road and found the casualties with serious wounds.
The driver and another were in an unconscious state with blood stains all over whilst another at the back was found dead. They were rushed to the Ragama Hospital.
Wattala Police arrived at the scene and learnt that the trio were returning from Preethipura Beach and had crashed into two other vehicles whilst turning to Elakanda Road from Palliyawatta Junction.
The trishaw had toppled on the road but the daring travellers disregarding their serious wounds had straightened the vehicle back on its wheels and fled the scene.
They couldnt precede much with the critical status and the vehicle gradually slowed down on the road. The police said the group had traversed at an excessive speed.
The police however said the entire incident was suspicious as the victims bore severe gashes on the head compared to the wounds received by the other two from the accident. (Sanath Desmond and Kurulu Kujana Kariyakarawana)

MR rejects Ranils claims
	
While rejecting allegations that his government had misappropriated some Rs. 28b at the Highway ministry, former President Mahinda Rajapaksa today charged that the current government is engaging in a smear campaign against him and an attempt to belittle the solid achievements of his government in infrastructure development.Issuing a statement the former President said;
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe alleged yesterday, that I had in my capacity as the Minister of Highways taken a loan of Rs. 55 billion from the National Savings Bank for 28 road projects but that Rs. 28 billion of this money had been used for other purposes such as helicopter rides and providing free meals to people. This is a part of the ongoing smear campaign against me and an attempt to belittle the solid achievements of my government in infrastructure development. The Road Development Authority did indeed obtain a long term credit facility of Rs. 55 billion from the NSB for 28 road projects.
The Rs. 28 billion referred to by the Prime Minister is not a part of the Rs. 55 billion long term loan. It is a separate short-term loan that was negotiated between the Road Development Authority and the NSB to meet payments relating to various ongoing projects. The Treasury has in fact issued letters of comfort to the NSB asking them to release this short-term loan to the RDA to be settled later through the 2015 budget. All road projects are evaluated by RDA engineers and tender boards and payments are certified based on the work done. The Parliamentary Committee on Public Enterprises (COPE) can verify the work carried out by the RDA on the basis of the NSB credit facilities.
The Rs. 28 billion short-term loan from the NSB was utilised for most part to meet the local component requirements in projects funded by foreign donors like JICA and the ADB. Some of it was used for the maintenance and repair of existing roads. In any event all the money was spent on Road Development. As for the other Rs. 55 billion taken from the NSB, some of the projects coming under that long-term loan are still ongoing and the entire amount has not yet been utilised. I wish to state that provision was made in my last budget for the repayment of the entire short-term loan of Rs. 28 billion to the NSB and it was approved by parliament. The reason why the present government is concocting various stories about this Rs. 28 billion is obviously because they have mis-spent the money allocated in my budget and are now unable to make the scheduled payment to the NSB.

No burning problem in SLFP- Chandrika
	
There was no big problem in the SLFP as some had purported could split the party, former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga said.
Addressing the SLFP members at a meeting in Kandy on Saturday the former President said that some are trying to split the SLFP again as it was done in 1980 and again in 2001 when some helped Ranil Wickremesinghe to topple my government, we should not be discouraged.
Mrs. Kumaratunga said the former president (Mahinda Rajapaksa) should have stayed at home after his defeat. He cant stay without power because he knows what he has done in the past, I have stayed at home for nine years without losing the election, she said.
The SLPFs policy of robbing during the past ten years had ensured the people to reject the SLFP candidate on January 08. I must say I was never defeated in a single election, she said.

SL sided with UN on all same-sex couples issue: NFF
	
			The National Freedom Front (NFF) today charged that the government has violated Sri Lankan law and Foreign Policy by voting against a proposal to stop the United Nations extending staff benefits to all same-sex couples at the UN General Assembly budget committee in March.
			Addressing a media briefing NFF Media Spokesman Mohammed Muzammil accused the government of leading the country towards a cultural destruction while the country that is already experiencing political and economic instability due to the government's course of action.
			The proposal presented by the Russian government failed at the UN budget committee to stop the UN extending staff benefits to all same-sex couples after the committee voted 80 to 43 against the proposal and 37 nations abstaining.
			Mr. Muzammil said among India, Saudi Arabia, China, Iran, Egypt, Pakistan and Syria which voted in favour of Russia's proposal, Sri Lanka was the only South Asian country that opposed the proposal.
			As a country deeply rooted in Buddhist philosophy and its teachings, Sri Lanka is enriched with various cultures which have been protected for centuries. Even in the Sri Lankan Penal Code, homosexuality is a non-bailable offence and encouraging it is also an offence. But, the government has accepted homosexuality publicly. It is clear that the government has violated the country's law and trivialised our foreign policy internationally, he charged.
			The NFF Spokesman asked as to who took the decision to back homosexuality which has become a much-talked about topic in the world recently.
			However, this action indicates the government's attempts to deviate from longlasting policies of the country, he said.
			
		
			Russias proposal called for the withdrawal of the administrative ruling of UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon in July 2014 to recognise all same-sex marriages of its staff, allowing them to receive UN benefits. (Piyumi Fonseka)
