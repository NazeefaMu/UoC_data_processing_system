Activists warn : Activists warn HR on the brink of collapse
	

The crisis is caused by those who have now lost their offices
	There has been some progress in the struggle for justice initiated by this country
	Democracy has been manipulated so hideously for the benefit of politicians

In the wake of the controversial appointment of Mahinda Rajapaksa as the Prime Minister of Sri Lanka, the glimmer of hope for post-war reconciliation promised by the Sirisena-Wickremasinghe Government has waned. The Daily Mirror spoke to activists and critics who admitted there were delays in the transitional justice programme. However, they pointed out that the recent appointment may also mean that the entire process may come to a halt. They raised concerns about the implications of the undemocratic and unconstitutional appointment of a Prime Minister single-handedly by the executive president. They further raised questions about how the crisis would affect the judiciary, law enforcement and institutions such as the independent commissions and the Constitutional Council.

RECONCILAITION MUST CONTINUE
Executive Director of the National Peace Council of Sri Lanka, Dr. Jehan Perera stressed on the importance of the continuation of the reconciliation process initiated by the Sirisena-Wickramasinghe Government. I know it (the reconciliation process) is an imperfect one and a slow one. But it is still better than any reconciliation process we have ever had in our country. I dont want to see the country return to those who governed the country before 2015 when we all lived in fear, he said.

We have always transferred power from one government to another in a peaceful and democratic manner almost always through elections and transparently
Dr. Jehan Perera



We have always transferred power from one government to another in a peaceful and democratic manner almost always through elections and transparently. Here the appointment happened in the dead of the night- in the darkness- without the people knowing, even without the Government leaders knowing. This is a very dangerous precedent for the future, he added The people in this country fear the future, he said.
REVERSAL IN TERMS OF THE HUMAN RIGHTS SITUATION IF RAJAPASKSA SUCCEEDS
Executive Director of the Center for Policy Alternatives, Dr. Paikiasothy Saravanamuttu, said that if Mahinda Rajapaksa proceeded the way he did prior to 2015, it would mean the country turning its back on the Human Rights Council, on the 30/1 resolution and entering into an antagonistic relationship with the UN. On the other hand if they were to be more cooperative we could see whether there is a possibility of another resolution to watch these other institutions while they are being set up. But I think this is highly unlikely. So we may well face a reversal in terms of the human rights situation if Rajapasksa succeeds, he said.

Dr. Paikiasothy Saravanamuttu



The OMP has been set up and it continues with its work. The legislation for the office on reparation was passed. As far as the commission of justice and peace is concerned I understand that the Ranil Wickremesinghe cabinet approved the idea of going ahead with it. But the accountability mechanism will not happen because of the controversial issue regarding judges, he added.
LOOK FOR ALTERNATIVES
Dr. Harini Amarasuriya, a member of the Public Representation Committee (PRC) and a senior lecturer at the Open University said that people should look for alternative means to ensure that the reconciliation process moves forward. We know that these two parties are not going to do it. Its very clear that that interests them in the least. Its time we turn our backs on these two parties and look for alternatives or build up alternatives that can help us, she said.
EMBLEMATIC CASES WILL COME TO A STANDSTILL
Activist Shreen Abdul Saroor said that a culture of buying parliamentarians affects not just parliamentary democracy, but also justice and the due process.
She pointed out that there were a few emblematic cases such as the disappearance of Pradeep Ekneligoda, the students who were abducted by the Navy and were being investigated, but could come to a standstill if the former regime returns to power.
There has been some progress in the struggle for justice initiated by this country. This will end, she said.
She further highlighted that previously in rape cases for instance, which are taken up in the North, magistrates would be influenced by politicians. However, during the last three years magistrates and District Court Judges worked without political interference and intimidation, she said.
The space that was created for the average citizen to have access to the judiciary would roll back immediately. People were so scared to trust the police before. It was the military that was in charge of law and order. That is what we see immediately after Mahinda Rajapaksa was appointed, she added.
She further quizzed: What is going to happen to the Constitutional Council These are structures that did at least a bit of checks and balances. The Prime Minister sits in the Constitutional Council and we dont know who the Prime Minister is now. Who will nominate the members to the independent commission
If the paramilitary groups which were part of the culture previously gets activated, how would any commissioner function independently
Politicians are selling our votes at a time when the people in the country are paralyzed by the way the executive presidents power has been used to appoint Mahinda Rajapaksa as the Prime Minister and prorogue Parliament. The speaker is unable to exercise his power though 118 parliamentarians have given their mandate. What is democracy in this country she quizzed.
A TRAVESTY OF DEMOCRACY
When asked about the current political crisis and its implications on Sri Lankas Human Rights record Feminists Researcher Chulani Kodikara questioned how Mahason Balakaya Leader Amith Weerasinghe was released on bail and highlighted the forcible take over of state media institutions and magistrate court judges being transferred,
Why has this happened at this time Does this have to do with some of the human rights cases The justice process has been very slow in moving, but it has been moving in some cases such as the Ekneligoda Case, and the assassination of the Sunday Leader Editor, she said.
What is the great hurry There was an election in 2015. Why not wait for the next elections and see what the people have to say We have ceded our sovereign power to our elected members. If our Prime Minister (I am even willing to concede here) and President dont want Parliament to meet what does that mean Whose interests will this prorogation serve she quizzed.
Referring to Members of Parliament crossing over for money she said it was a travesty of democracy. Whose money is this I am aghast and so upset. I casted my vote not for the people to cross over for millions of money. In my opinion this is a fundamental human rights violation, she said.
ITS BAD NEWS FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
Political Scientist Prof. Jayadeva Uyangoda said that Sri Lanka had entered a phase of democratic setbacks. The democratization process is being reversed. It will be very difficult to restore public confidence in politicians, democratic processes and institutions, he said.

Its a pity that no one is challenging this before the Supreme Court. This shows that people also dont have trust in the Supreme Court
Jayadeva Uyangoda


When we have a change in Government outside the framework of the Constitution, its bad news for human rights, he said.
He went onto add that the violation of the Constitution by the President is being politically justified, not legally. That is where the danger lies. The Constitution is interpreted in the way they want. There is an arbitrary interpretation of the Constitution outside the normal principles found in constitutional interpretation, he said.
Its a pity that no one is challenging this before the Supreme Court. This shows that people also dont have trust in the Supreme Court, he added.

MR REIGME CURTAILED FREEDON OF EXPRESSION
Prof. Chandragupta Thenuwara, the former President of the Federation University Teachers Associations (FUTA) said: We care about who our Prime Minister is because we have memories of what the Mahinda Rajapaksa regime did to us by manipulating and abducting people, harassing and killing journalists and curtailing freedom of expression. Mahinda Rajapaksa must retire from politics. We thought we have a President who protects peoples human rights. But he has shown that he is only protecting his ego.
NO POLITICAL OR CONSTITUTIONAL CRISIS
Famous Artist and Attorney-at-Law Douglas Siriwardane said that since violence did not ensue the appointment of Mahinda Rajapaksa as the Prime Minister it meant that the people had awaited such a change.
No one has gone to court regarding this. Ranil Wickremesinghes allies have not sought the assistance of the judiciary, instead they have made this out to be a political dispute, he said.

Killing one or two, who have been informants, can be justified based on the greater good for the country- to end the war and bring peace. This is not a crime
Douglas Siriwardane


When the appointment made by the executive president has been gazetted and a letter of removal has been sent to the former Prime Minister, then there is only one Prime Minister. The Prime Minister is the one who is sworn before the President. There is no political or constitutional crisis that has arisen by the appointment. The crisis is caused by those who have now lost their offices, he said.

He further said that under the coalition Government there was corruption as opposed to their slogan of fighting corruption and being anti-corrupt. The Bond scam ripped off the country. The price of oil and interest rates increased. Taxes were imposed on imports, foreign income and savings. There was no action to equalise the burden on the people and provide them with relief, he said. Asked about human rights abuses that the purported Prime Minister (Mahinda Rajapaksa) has been accused of, he said that even enemies have the fundamental right to life. However, he said: Killing one or two, who have been informants, can be justified based on the greater good for the country- to end the war and bring peace. This is not a crime. These vans also abducted goons attached to the underworld, he said.

Last Sunday, a protest was held by the Peoples Movement for Justice and Democracy at the Liberty Roundabout where protesters from around the country condemned the illegal and arbitrary appointment of Mahinda Rajapaksa as the Prime Minister and demanded for democracy, justice, and equality.


We have not seen justice
-Mohamed
Since the end of the war we have been fighting and advocating for transitional justice, but until now we have not seen justice not learned of any truth. So we have no hope on those wielding power. I dont believe they will ensure our transitional justice, said Buhari Mohamed, a youth from Batticaloa.

White vanswill come
-Sister Nicholas
During the past few years the President agreed to a resolution. But nothing in that resolution has been implemented fully. We fear that the white vans will come again and that there would be disappearances. People would be arrested arbitrary, said Sister Nicholas from Vavuniya.

We want justice
-Bogahawatte
We are here for democracy. The court cases that were filed would be lost. We want justice delivered and there should be peace in the country, said L. Bogahawatte from Matara.

Parliament should be reconvene
- Kumudini
Given that Parliamentary supremacy should reign supreme, we see that MPs are being bought and sold. Its like an auction and MPs are shamelessly switching sides. Our democracy is being pulled into an abyss. Parliament should be reconvened. This crisis should be resolved, said Kumudini Samuel.

Im here to express my anger
- Tania
Democracy has been manipulated so hideously for the benefit of politicians. Im here to express my anger at the manner in which my vote is being sold and for the rights of the childrens future, said Tania Bartlett, a teacher.

Democracy is now a politrick

- Sister Angela
The President has broken the promises he made. We saw leadership qualities in him and he promised to serve the society. But he has broken all those promises. Democracy is now a politrick, said Sister Angela Fernando from Dehiwala.

## Title: Can President Dissolve Parliament  
## Section: Opinion
## Date: 6 November 2018 12:04 am
Can President Dissolve Parliament  
	

One of the objectives of the 19th Amendment to the Constitution was to restrict powers of the President to dissolve parliament within four and-a-half years. Was that objective successfully achieved My reading of the constitution is the opposite. 
Firstly, the reader is advised to be cautious not to treat my contention as final. This is only an academic exercise to explore the true intention of the legislature on a plain reading of the relevant Articles (Sections) of the Constitution. 
Prior to the 19A Article 70 (1) directly dealt with the Presidents powers to dissolve the Parliament; i.e. The President may, from time to time, by Proclamation summon, prorogue and dissolve Parliament:There were several provisos to the above article with restrictions. 
The 19A deleted the words time to time and included a proviso preventing the president from dissolving parliament until a lapse of four and-a-half years from the first meeting; 
70(1) The President may by Proclamation, summon, prorogue and dissolve Parliament: 
Provided that the President shall not dissolve Parliament until the expiration of a period of not less than four years and six months from the date appointed for its first meeting, unless Parliament requests the President to do so by a resolution passed by not less than two-thirds of the whole number of Members (including those not present), voting in its favour 
Very strangely, sub-article 70(5) recognizes two modes of dissolution; they are as follows:- 
5 (a) A Proclamation dissolving Parliament shall fix a date or dates for the election of Members of Parliament, and shall summon the new Parliament to meet on a date not later than three months after the date of such Proclamation. 

The 19A deleted the words time to time and included a proviso preventing the president from dissolving parliament until a lapse of four and-a-half years from the first meeting
(b) Upon the dissolution of Parliament by virtue of the provisions of Paragraph (2) of Article 62,The President shall forthwith by Proclamation fix a date or dates for the election of Members of Parliament, and shall summon the new Parliament to meet on a date not later than three months after the date of such Parliament 
Sub-Article 75(5) (a) refers to the mode of dissolution provided in Article 70(1) and Sub-Article 75(5)(b) recognizes the mode in Article 62(2). 
Then the next question is whether the Article 62(2) refers to a separate mode of dissolution. Here again we see a discrepancy between the Sinhala and English texts in the construction of this Article. 
The English text reads as follows; 
Unless Parliament is sooner dissolved, every Parliament shall continue for five years from the date appointed for its first meeting and no longer, and the expiry of the said period of five years shall operate as a dissolution of Parliament
On the face of it the term dissolution refers to an automatic incident of dissolution by operation of law on expiration of a term of five years. 
However, the Sinhala text categorically specifies a stand alone mode of dissolution within a period of five years. This difference is resulted by drafting this Article in three separate sentences. The translation is produced (to the nearest meaning) as follows; 
Every Parliament shall continue for five years from the date appointed for its first meeting and no longer. However, Parliament can be dissolved before expiration of the (said) (stated) period. However on the expiry of the said period of five years Parliament to be considered as dissolved.
It is to be noted that when there is an inconsistency between the texts the Sinhala Text prevails (Sec 48 of the 19th Amendment).
The Literal meaning given in the Sinhala text of Article 70(5)(2) is When Parliament was dissolved by virtue of Article 62 sub Article (2).... As aforesaid the Sinhala text of 62(2) provides for a (second) mode of dissolution. Both these Articles (in the Sinhala text) are constructed to mean an act of dissolution caused upon the Parliament; but no automatic dissolution by operation of law. 
However, Article 62(2) does not refer to a person having the authority to do the act of dissolution (Actor). Then there should be a reference somewhere else in the Constitution to a person with powers to execute the act of dissolution. 
The answer is in Article 33(2)(c) of the Constitution. The 19A introduced the following sub-article (c) to Article 33(2) which deals with specific powers of the President. The new sub-article is read as follows; 
 33(2) In addition to the powers, duties and functions expressly conferred or imposed on or assigned to the President by the Constitution or other written law, the President shall have the power- (c) to summon, prorogue and dissolve Parliament
The question is whether the powers specified in Article 33(2) are stand-alone or subject to Article 70 which restricts dissolution within four and-a-half years. 
To answer we have to look into other powers given to the President by Article 33(2). They include (i) to make the State of Government Polity at the commencement of the parliamentary session (ii) to preside at ceremonial sittings of Parliament (iii) to appoint Ambassadors and High Commissioners (iv) Appoint Presidents Counsel (v) to Keep the public Seal of the Republic and engage in relevant functions stated therein (vi) to declare war and peace (vii) to do other things not inconsistent with the constitution and law. 
All these are specific powers conferred on the President in addition to the powers and duties and functions expressly conferred or imposed on or assigned by the Constitutionor any other law. The words in addition make this sub-article standalone conferring additional (specific) powers apart from those entrusted on the president by the other Articles. In the circumstances the powers given to the President to dissolve by Article 33(2)(C) are in addition to powers given by Article 70(1).
Therefore on a plain reading of Article 33(2)(c) with 62(2) and 70(1) it is clear that the constitution has opened two independent avenues for the President to dissolve the parliament. 
On the other hand, it is also reasonable to argue that the President has powers to act on Article 33(2)(c) alone without having recourse to Article 62(2), as Article 33(2)(c) is authoritatively independent. 
The next issue is whether the President has a choice between the two Articles to act upon. 
Only few, among several, specifically refer to Article 70. One of them is Article 48(2); i.e:- 
If Parliament rejects the Statement of Government Policy or the Appropriation Bill or passes a vote of no-confidence in the Government, the Cabinet of Ministers shall stand dissolved, and the President shall, unless he has in the exercise of his powers under Article 70, dissolved Parliament, appoint a Prime Minister, Ministers of the Cabinet of Ministers, Ministers who are not members of the Cabinet of Ministers and Deputy Ministers in terms of Articles 42, 43, 44 and 45.
The above Article compels the President to appoint a new Prime Minister upon occurrence of the three incidents (e.g. defeat of appropriation bill; i.e. budget) refers to therein; if such had happened within four and-a-half years from the first meeting of the parliament. In Sri Lanka sovereignty is in the People. Sovereignty includes powers of government (Art.3). The executive power of the people shall be exercised by the President elected by the people (Art.4(b). The President is the head of the State, head of the Executive and of the Government (Art 30(1). The Cabinet of Ministers charged with the direction and control of the Government (Art.42(1). The President shall appoint as Prime Minister the Member of Parliament, who, in the Presidents opinion, is most likely to command the confidence of Parliament (Article 42(4). 

In Sri Lanka sovereignty is in the People. Sovereignty includes powers of government (Art.3). The executive power of the people shall be exercised by the President elected by the people (Art.4(b)
If the President cannot form an opinion as to the person commanding the confidence of Parliament to appoint as the next Prime Minister or if due to defeat of budget or for any other reason the President (being the head of the Government) finds the stability of the Government cannot be sustained or would collapse (which endangers the governance of the country), there should be an alternative mechanism provided in the constitution to uphold the sovereignty of the people and ensure national security. In such situations it would be dangerous and disastrous to run the country with an unstable government until lapse of four and-a-half years to dissolve the Parliament. The solution to this dilemma is provided in Article 33(2)(C) (read with / without Article 62(2). That is the second mode available in the constitution for the president to dissolve the parliament without waiting for four and-a-half years. 
Dissolution ends the life of the existing parliament. According to A.V. Dicey (a British Whig jurist / constitutional theorist) Crown has the right of dissolution in extreme circumstances. He wrote A dissolution is in its essence an appeal from the legal to the political sovereign. A dissolution is allowable, or necessary, whenever the wishes of the legislature are, or may fairly be presumed to be, different from the wishes of the nation According to him the objective of dissolution is to Ascertain that will of parliament coincides with the will of the nation.
Referendum
To ascertain the will of the nation and to obtain the sanction directly from the people to dissolve the parliament the President has another option. That is to hold a referendum under Article 86 of the Constitution. Under that The President may, subject to the provisions of Article 85, submit to the People by Referendum any matter which in the opinion of the President is of national importance.Referendum is a manner in which the People exercise their Sovereignty (Article 4(a) and (e). 
If the President (head of the Government) finds the Government is in a crisis situation, which prevents him from carrying out his executive functions (as the head of the executive) through the machinery of Government, the constitution authorizes the President to submit that matter to the people as of national importance. Finally the people will have to resolve the confusion created by the politicians.

Deepawali festival  : Celebrating good winning against evil
	

Hindus celebrate Deepawali (Also known as Diwali) as the day Lord Krishna finally subdued the demon Narakasura. Though this is the belief of Sri Lankan Tamils regarding Diwali, people of Southern India use the occasion to commemorate the conquering of Asura Naraka, a powerful king of Assam. This king is said to have imprisoned thousands of inhabitants and it was Lord Krishna, a deity worshiped in Hinduism, who was finally able to subdue Asura Naraka and free the prisoners. 
There is also a North Indian belief that Deewali is celebrated to honour Lord Sri Rama Chandra, the Seventh Avatar Incarnation of God Vishnu. It is believed that on this day Rama returned to his people after 14 years in exile. It is also said that he won a battle against the demons and King Ravana. People lit lamps in their houses to celebrate his victory over evil (light over darkness). 
The goddess of happiness and good fortune, Lakshmi, also features in the celebrations. It is believed that she roams the earth on this day and enters the house that is pure, clean, and bright. 

Indians regardless of faith or whether they are Hindus, Janis, Buddhists, and Sikhs also celebrate Diwali. In all interpretations, one common thread rings true; the festival marks the victory of goodover evil
The festival gets its name from the row of clay lamps (Deepangal in avali). Deepa avali meaning rows of lighted lamps, It is also known as the festival of lights where clay lamps are lit in the night to signify the victory of good over evil. The light outside their homes symbolises the inner light that protects the individual from spiritual darkness. 
Indians regardless of faith or whether they are Hindus, Janis, Buddhists, and Sikhs also celebrate Diwali. In all interpretations, one common thread rings true; the festival marks the victory of good over evil. 
The goddess of wealth and prosperity is Lakshmi. Some believe the day of celebration coincides with her birthday and that is the day that she married
Lord Vishnu. 
Legend has it that demon Naraka Asura just prior to death realised the bad things he had done and in turn made a request to celebrate his demise to mark happiness. 
In Jainism the occasion marks the nirvana or spiritual awakening of Lord Mahavira (on October 15, 527 B.C). Sikhs use it to celebrate a renowned teacher (Guru Hargobind Ji, the Sixth Sikh Guru) who was freed from imprisonment. 
In Sikhism it marks the day that Guru Hargobind Ji, the Sixth Sikh Guru was freed from imprisonment. 

There is also a North Indian belief that Deewali is celebrated to honour Lord Sri Rama Chandra, the Seventh Avatar Incarnation of God Vishnu. It is believed that on this day Rama returned to his people after 14 years in exile
Goddess Lakshmi
Diwali falls either in October or November, but the exact dates change annually based on the Hindu Lunar Calendar, 
When the holiday is celebrated, residents leave their windows and doors open to allow Goddess Lakshmi to find her way into their homes, 
Every home is lit with clay lamps and the brightness leaves no room for darkness to enter. Doorsteps are decorated with lamps. 
People wear new clothes to thank Goddess Lakshmi for ensuring prosperity and bringing good fortune. And when late evening dawns, firecrackers are set off. Throughout the festival, traditional sweets and savory items are consumed. 
The Five Days of Diwali are celebrated in some parts of India. 
On the first day of Diwali, people consider it auspicious to spring-clean their homes and shops. 
On the second day, people decorate their homes with clay lamps and draw patterns called rangoli on the floor using coloured powders or sand. 
The third day is dedicated for the main day of the festival. Families gather together for Lakshmi Pooja, during which prayers are offered to Goddess Lakshmi. This session is followed by mouth-watering feasts and firework festivities. 
The fourth day is considered as the first day of the New Year where friends and relatives visit with gifts and best wishes, for the season. 

The goddess of wealth and prosperity is Lakshmi. Some believe the day of celebration coincides with her birthday and that is the day that she married Lord Vishnu. Legend has it that demon Naraka Asura just prior to death realised the bad things he had done and in turn made a request to celebrate his demise to mark happiness
On the final and fifth day of Diwali, brothers visit their married sisters who welcome them with love and treat them to a lavish meal. 
Diwali celebrations may vary in different communities, but its significance and spiritual meaning is generally the awareness of the inner light. 
The Diwali festival symbolises the victory of righteousness and marks the victory of good over evil.

Environment; Silent victim of Sri Lankan war
	

Today is the United Nations International Day for Preventing the Exploitation of the Environment in War and Armed Conflict. In a statement to mark the event the UN says though the world has counted its war casualties in terms of dead and wounded soldiers and civilians, destroyed cities and livelihoods, the environment has often remained the unpublicized victim of war.

Water wells have been polluted, crops torched, forests cut down, soils poisoned and animals killed to gain military advantage. Furthermore, the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) has found that over the past 60 years, at least 40% of all internal conflicts have been linked to the exploitation of natural resources, whether high-value resources such as timber, diamonds, gold and oil, or scarce resources such as fertile land and water. Conflicts involving natural resources have also been found to be twice as likely to relapse. 
The UN says it attaches great importance to ensuring that action on the environment is part of conflict prevention, peacekeeping and peace building strategies - because there can be no durable peace if the natural resources that sustain livelihoods and ecosystems are destroyed. 
On May 27, 2016, the United Nations Environment Assembly adopted a resolution, which recognized the role of healthy ecosystems and sustainably managed resources in reducing the risk of armed conflict, and reaffirmed its strong commitment to the full implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals listed in General Assembly resolution 70/1, entitled Transforming our world: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. 
In Sri Lanka, again embroiled in political turmoil as it struggles to recover from the multi-faceted devastation of the 26-year civil war, an action group has examined the environmental impacts of the use of explosive weaponry in all its aspects. 
The group Action on Armed Violence (AOAV) says it seeks to reduce the impact of armed violence through monitoring and research of the causes and consequences of weapon-based violence. It has a specific focus on the impact of explosive weapons with wide area effects in populated areas and has been running a global monitor of explosive violence since October 2010.
According to the group landmines were used by both the LTTE and the government forces throughout the conflict in the North. This left the land highly contaminated by explosive weaponry  not only landmines but also other explosive remnants of war including civilian areas such as schools and villages, as well as large swathes of agricultural and open land. This contamination has prolonged displacement, caused both physical and psychological damage as well having had an impact on education and agriculture. In 2014, UNICEF reported there had been more than 22,000 casualties from mines and explosive remnants of war in Sri Lanka, including at least 1,603 civilians. While these numbers have significantly reduced since the end of the war, there continue to be casualties from these explosives each year. 
The group also says that during the war, many crops were destroyed by bombing and the effects of war. For example, according to the Coconut Conservation Society, at least 50,000 coconut trees were impacted by the war. While more than 2.5 million palmyrah palm trees were cut down to make bunkers for protection from the bombardment and for firewood. Palmyrah are the only tall trees that tend to grow in the north and east. The palmyrah tree not only provides fruit that is a staple food in the diet of the population in the impacted areas, it also protects other plants, people, infrastructure and wildlife from strong winds, as well as contributing to drought resistance by helping to retain water in the soil. Losing so many trees clearly, then, had impact. 
According to the group, it has been said in the past that Sri Lanka appears to consider the natural environment more than some of its neighbours. However, the war is thought to have been a distraction from their environmental commitments for many years, while the post-war development drive has caused harmful effects to the environment and the people that survive from it in the impacted provinces and beyond. 
The environment has been considered the silent victim of war, and it is clear that this remains the case in Sri Lanka.

Khashoggis sons  demand return of his body
	

Journalist Jamal Khashoggis sons issued an emotional appeal to have their fathers body returned home during a sit-down with CNN. 
Salah and Abdullah Khashoggi said theyve been through weeks of agony following his disappearance and the confirmation on
his death. 
I really hope that whatever happened wasnt painful for him, or it was quick. Or he had a peaceful death, Abdullah Khashoggi, 33, said during his interview alongside his brother Salah, 35 in Washington on Sunday. 
His sons say without their fathers body, grieving and closure is not possible. 
Salah, Khashoggis eldest son says, despite the misinformation he has received about his fathers untimely death, he believes Saudi King Salman bin Abdulaziz when he says those responsible will be found out. 
The King has stressed that everybody involved will be brought to justice. And I have faith in that. This will happen. Otherwise Saudi wouldnt have started an internal investigation..., Salah told CNN Turkeys President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has claimed that the order to kill journalist Jamal Khashoggis came from the highest levels of the Saudi government.

On Friday, it was claimed that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman called Khashoggi a dangerous Islamist to Trump officials shortly after he vanished. Salman also told Jared Kushner and National Security Adviser John Bolton that Khashoggi was a member of the Muslim Brotherhood during a phone call a few days after the journalist went missing. 
Khashoggis family have previously and repeatedly denied that the reporter was a member of the Brotherhood, calling suggestions that he was dangerous ridiculous.UK, (Daily Mail), 5 November 2018

## Title: Kicking aside the Mandate

Kicking aside the Mandate
	
The composition cannot change and must remain constant for the entire duration of that Parliament

When Members elected to Parliament from one party crossover to another, for whatsoever reason, it is a violation of the mandate received at the hands of the voters, which they are honour and duty bound to protect.
As for honour, there is none and for all their rhetoric of laying down their lives for the people, there is no sense of duty.
Members are elected on a party ticket, and not in their individual capacity. A mere look at a ballot paper amply demonstrates this fact.
See a specimen ballot paper above.
Thus, you see that there are two parts. The first and the one on top is your vote. You just vote for a party or group. If you choose not to mark a preference for any candidate or candidates  up to 3  from that party that you voted for, your vote is still a valid vote.
On the other hand, if you did not vote for a party or group, i.e. not marking your vote in the top section, but only marked a preference for 1, 2 or 3 from the box at the bottom, yours is NOT a valid vote and will be rejected.

At the close of the poll, the party or group vote is counted and the number of seats determined, first on a district basis and then totalled up to get the final composition of the Parliament.
At the last General Election the party positions were as follows;
UNP .. 106
UPFA .. 95
TNA  16
JVP  06
SLMC ..... 01
EPDP 01
This was how the country voted. This was the final composition of Parliament.
This composition cannot change and must remain constant for the entire duration of that Parliament. If it does not, it is a distortion of the mandate of the people.
Individual members do not count. If one ceases to be a member of the party, he must necessarily lose his seat to the next in line on the preference vote list.
Let us see the constitutional aspect of this.
Article 99(13) as amended by the 14th Amendment states Where a member of Parliament ceases, by resignation, expulsion or otherwise, to be a member of a recognised political party or independent group on whose nomination paper his name appeared at the time of his becoming a member of Parliament, his seat shall become vacant upon the expiration of a period of one month from the date of his ceasing to be such a member
There, however, is a proviso  where a member expelled challenges the validity of his expulsion in the Supreme Court, his seat will fall vacant only upon the Supreme Court holding that his expulsion is valid.
The first test case was the expulsion of Gamini Dissanayake, Lalith Athlathmudali et al on the Impeachment Motion they brought against the then President Ranasinghe Premadasa  Gamini Dissanayake vs. M.C.M. Kaleel and others.
The dissidents argued that: (a) They were not given a hearing according to the principles of natural justice and (b) that they are entitled to act according to their judgment and conscience.
The apex court held, inter alia, that;
1. The Constitution confers primacy to the political party as against the individual
2. The exercise of Fundamental Rights of speech and expression was subordinate to the requirements of party discipline,
3. The joining of a political party means acceptance of reciprocal obligations Limiting their freedom of speech, and
4. Dissenting opinions should be the subject of internal discussion before being articulated outside.
The next case of MP, Thilak Karunaratne, expelled from the SLFP for publishing a newspaper article, was decided in his favour by a majority decision.
The Supreme Court held that he had taken every possible step within the party to air his grievance before going public. The dissenting Judge held that the Court was not empowered to go into the merits of the expulsion.
In the case where Sarath Amunugama et al, having endorsed the Presidential candidature of Ranil Wickremesinghe at the party convention on Sunday, went to Temple Trees on the following Monday and pledged support to the opponent and thereafter worked toward her victory.
The Court held that there was a procedural improprietyin the expulsion process.
The party leadership could very well have re-commenced disciplinary action, adhering to the rules of natural justice, but for unknown reasons, it failed to do so, and are now reaping the bitter fruits of that neglect.
The last case of relevance is that of Basheer Segu Dawood, member of the SLMC, who formed an alliance with another party and faced the polls as the NUA. He was nominated on the National list. The NUA expelled him. The Court held that he was not a member of the NUA but of the SLMC, hence he could not have been expelled by NUA!!
One can see the drift. In all instances, the members affected were in Government when disciplinary action was taken and when the cases went before the court. Somewhere down the line, we seemed to have missed the wood for the trees.
A Parliamentary Select Committee on Electoral Reform has recommended a system where the majority of members are directly elected by, and responsible to, a specific electorate, which will not prevent crossovers, but will, at least ensure that the member he be personally answerable to his voters for the decision he made.
A further and more radical step would be to prohibit an MP who crosses over from the Opposition to the Government from accepting Ministerial office during the remainder of the term of the Parliament.  Constitutional Issues in Sri Lanka  Ruana Rajapakse (2008)
This committee obviously had not considered the lure of filthy lucre, which even then was not something new.
Thus you will see that- let alone one member defying the party whip-if a whole bunch of them desert the party which elected them, (as is happening today), it is a gross distortion and a violation of the mandate of the people.
Today, its as bad as it can get, or are we in for more and as the Americans would say, You aint seen nothing yet. Hail, our honourable political prostitutes!!

LGBTQI+ community condemns Prez's remarks on butterfly life
	
Members of the Sri Lankan LGBTQI+ community today categorically condemned President Maithripala Sirisenas statement made at Governments rally in Colombo saying he was promoting homophobia and public incitement of homophobic hatred.
They said in a statement that the President had made a series of homophobic comments at a public rally held on Monday and that those comments were met with laughter and applause by those gathered on stage besides Sirisena, including Mahinda Rajapaksa who was appointed as Prime Minister by Sirisena.
The President, who was in a Unity Government with the United National Front (UNF) led by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, categorically stated that Mr Wickremesinghe rejected national values and had entered a butterfly life [samanala jeevithaya in Sinhala], which implies a queer lifestyle.
Sirisena then commented that key decisions of government were made not by the President nor by party seniors but by Mr Wickremesinghe and his butterfly caucus [samanala rela in Sinhala].
These comments were met with laughter and applause by those gathered on stage, he said.
The President said the homophobia openly promoted by the elected head of state makes it clear that the President had absolutely no notion or commitment whatsoever for the fundamental rights and human dignity of all Sri Lankans.
It is particularly disappointing coming from a President elected on the votes of many members of the Sri Lankan LGBTQI+ community who saw his candidacy as a respite from the rampant homophobia of the preceding Rajapaksa presidency, the statement said.
It said President Sirisenas statement was a clear case of misinformation and was misleading his own party and supporters.
We condemn his use of homophobia to amuse his political gallery. By trivialising homophobia in this fashion, President Sirisena should be held responsible for any homophobic incidents that Sri Lankan citizens may experience in the coming days, the statement issued with signatories of 210 members of the LGBTQI+ community said.

In the wake of travel advisories issued by some countries because of the current political unrest in the country, Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa has instructed newly-appointed Tourism Minister Vasantha Senanayake to visit London to mitigate the damage, an official said yesterday.
Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) let by the Prime Minister, briefed the media yesterday that several countries had upgraded their travel advisories following claims by the UNP leaders and Speaker Karu Jayasuriya of blood baths.
SLPP Chairman G.L. Peiris said the Speaker had acted entirely contrary to the laws and conventions by entertaining envoys and MPs in Parliament despite prorogation.
He said some countries issued travel advisories following talks of bloodshed.
This has happened at a time when the well-known magazine Lonely Planet identified Sri Lanka as the number one destination for tourists. It is a hit on the economy. This is the tourist season. Hotels have been booked. Talks of bloodbath are entirely reckless and treacherous, Prof. Peiris said.
He said the Prime Minister asked Minister Senanayake to travel to London along with hotel industry representatives to talk to the stakeholders.
Referring to UNP MP Navin Dissanayake saying the Constitution would be amended to make it compulsory for the President to consult the Speaker for the prorogation of Parliament, he asked why the UNP did not do it during the past three years and added that it was nothing but opportunism.
People will express their feelings. We are telling our people not to be provoked. Talks of bloodshed were made to destabilise the country, whose image we want to protect, Prof. Peiris said. (Kelum Bandara)

In their first ever major public rally after the new government was formed, Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa yesterday said no one could separate his alliance with President Maithripala Sirisena.
Mr. Rajapaksa said they have come to an agreement not to allow any tattle-tale to separate them. No one can set us against each other now, he told the Rata Surakina Jana Mahimaya rally.
He said he is committed to work with the President to establish democracy in the country, to salvage it from the alienation and to develop it including the North and East.
He also invited political parties which represent minority groups to join the new government to uplift the peoples livelihood irrespective of ethnic or other differences.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister said the decision taken by the President to appoint him as the Prime Minister was a serious one. Parting ways temporarily is not a strange phenomena in politics. We have joined today for the sake of the country, to prevent further alienation of it so that we can create a better country for future generations of Sri Lanka, he said.
He said he was able to reduce taxes and also fuel prices in a day after assuming duties as the Finance Minister. If I could have done it, that means they (previous government) could have also done it. However, they were focused on their well being instead of the people, Mr. Rajapaksa said.

There were about 3,000 quack dentists operating in the country other than registered dentists, Former President General Dental Practitioners Association, Dr Hilary Cooray said.
He was addressing the media after an award ceremony for Dental Awards - 2018 organised for the first time to honour and recognise those in the dental profession in the country.
The ceremony was held at the Nelum Pokuna Mahinda Rajapaksa Theatre yesterday.
There are more than 3,000 dentists who were registered with the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) but about 2,500 dentists are active, he said.
Those bogus dentists were not real doctors but they were the people who assisted for dental doctors. Real doctors are the people who were registered with the SLMC with a displayed registered number.
Even the registered number was printed on their prescriptions to state that they are qualified doctors, Dr Cooray said.
He said the quack dentists could also display a number to claim that they were also registered with the SLMC.
The best way to check was to check their names through the SLMC. There was no other way to identify them.
It is very hard to capture those bogus dentists and to take legal actions against them.
Patients have to come to Police stations to make complaints and go to courts against them.
Several patients come to us with severe consequences after being treated by these quacks,
Patients complain that they cannot go to courts and waste their time and money. Our association advises people to be aware of these quacks, he said. (Chaturanga Samarawickrama)

President Maithripala Sirisena yesterday said UNP Leader Ranil Wickremesinghe and his associates tried to drive a wedge between him and India.
Addressing the people gathered at the Jana Mahimaya rally at Battaramulla, the President said Mr. Wickremesinghes team spread misinformation to distance him and India.
India is our close ally with whom we have strong relationships which dated back to thousands of years. Ranil Wickremesinghe's team spread bogus reports and misinformation. Soon after my assassination plot was revealed, misinterpreted facts were secretly given to the media by Ranil Wickremesinghe and the team. We received Buddhism from India and we have years long of economic and cultural relations. We are close friendly countries. I will make sure our relations with India will soar, he said.
Meanwhile, he said the housing project in the North kept delaying for three and half years because Mr. Wickremesinghe as the Prime Minister, Ravi Karunanayake as the Finance Minister and D.M. Swaminathan as the Resettlement Minister fought over each other to win the project.
This project should have benefited 50,000 innocent families but not a single house was made. Other projects were initiated but this one kept delaying because the three ministers tried to win over the project, he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

## Date: 6 November 2018 12:10 am
Sangeetha Weeraratne or simply Sangeetha
	
Saptha Kanya


Saptha Kanya is one of those rare popular works of art which actually stood for something: in its case, the eighties. Like the music of Clarence Wijewardena and the voice of Rookantha Gunathilaka and the dubbed cartoons of Titus Thotawatte and the television serials of Somaweera Senanayake, it was a definitive symbol of the most turbulent decade to hit this country. It was hard not to love, to be honest. 
Saptha Kanya enraptured me the first time I saw it as a teenager for roughly the same reason why it continues to enrapture teenagers today; it tells a story and isnt ashamed of narrating it the way we want. A surprise hit when it was released, it proved that the director, H. D. Premaratne, was a force to be reckoned with and that art and commerce, far from being polar opposites, could cohabit. 
You can remember Saptha Kanya for many reasons. I remember it for two. Kamal Addaraarachchi and Sangeetha Weeraratne. I have already written on Kamal. This piece, for no reason whatsoever,is for Sangeetha. 

I cant think of another actress, before her time, who embodied the essence of her characters and made it look like it was the easiest thing in the world
Different roles
I cant explain why, or for that matter how, but as an actress Sangeetha never sticks to one mould. Unlike most actresses from her generation, she does not conform to one set of characterisations. I am not sure whether she picks her performances like some of her more studious contemporaries. I wouldnt be surprised if she doesnt. She can be a free soul in one film, a fun loving girl in another, a tempestuous, wronged lover in another, a rural innocent in yet another. The closest to a summing up of these, the way I see it, is this; she likes to taste freedom and she likes to flirt, but if necessity compels it, she can, and she does, rebel. Thankfully, the fact that it is difficult to categorise her roles has the effect of making us remember all her performances; its the thin line that divides a typecast performer from a more versatile player. 
Call me deluded, but when I see Sangeetha act, I dont see her oozing out what shes got to bring about a great or even good performance; she doesnt struggle or knit her eyebrows to do what the script demands her to do. Part of the reason for that is her easygoing personality, and her casual, almost dismissive voice: she doesnt muster every ounce shes got for her role, but gets into it in the easiest, most effective way possible. In the history of our cinema I cant think of another actress, before her time, who embodied the essence of her characters and made it look like it was the easiest thing in the world. Theres next to no effort, in other words, and even if there is, she doesnt make it obvious. That is, I believe, her signature. 
Yashoda Wimaladharma, as I wrote last week, had to graduate from the stage to the screen. Owing to her family, in particular her father, Sangeetha didnt have to make such a trek. Surprisingly for her, however, she was never really interested that much in the movies. I liked maths and dancing more, she remembered for me when we met somewhere in January 2015; these she took to when she shifted from her first school, St Johns College Panadura, to her second, Methodist College Colombo. 
Influence of Kamal
But then, her interests changed when her father, Timothy Weeraratne, entered the second phase of his career in the early eighties, and became a filmmaker. Still, she wasnt exactly moved by the idea of cinema as an art: I had a flair for accounts, so I became more fascinated with the business aspect to the movie-making process. With his connections in the industry, Timothy introduced young Sangeetha to Roy de Silva, who promptly cast her in Its a Matter of Time. She was 16. Perhaps it was more than just an irony of fate that even in her first outing, she would be paired with that most frequent collaborator and co-star of hers, Kamal Addaraarachchi, an advantage for her since I picked up a great many things about acting from him,she says. 
Its a Matter of Time, however, was a romantic comedy that, like most of Roys other romances and comedies, could have come from any director; for her to mature, she had to be taken aboard a more serious production. 
This was Nomiyena Minisun, directed by Gamini Fonseka. What was eye opening about the production was the man behind it. Fonseka had a knack for identifying the subtle nuances of his actors. This may or may not have come from his long career as our foremost and most sought after actor. In any case, he made you know wanted the best out of you. The challenge for her in Nomiyena Minisun was to play out a pregnant woman who learns that her boyfriend has died on the battlefield. How on earth could I portray a pregnant woman when I was barely 17 That she managed to pull it off on the first take, to her astonishment, didnt console her: Continuity was my biggest issue. A few weeks later, when I had to repeat my performance, I realised it was not going to be easy. To put it simply, I couldnt make myself cry. 

Maruthaya

Gamini
Fonseka being Fonseka, the solution presented itself to him in the most primitive way conceivable. Imagine me trying to emote, and imagine him coming to me, cool as a cucumber, and without even warning me, bursting a can of glycerine on my eyes. That was what he did. I didnt know how to react to it, except, of course, by crying. Which is, after all, what the director had wanted all along. 
From that point on, as that clich puts it, there was no turning back. From H. D. Premaratne to Vasantha Obeyesekere, from Sumitra Peries to Benet Ratnayake, from Udayakantha Warnasuriya to Sunil Ariyaratne, she has encountered and been tutored under those who took a serious attitude towards the movies. At the same time, she has occasionally dallied with commercial outings: Kolompoor (Dinesh Priyasad), Johnson and Gonson (Roy de Silva), Sathutai Kirula Ape (Sunil Soma Peiris), and the most atrociously enjoyable of them all, Rae Daniel Dawal Migel (Roy de Silva, again). For some reason, though I cant put a finger on it, I see the same character emerging from her in these populist forays, hedonistic and fun-loving, self-indulgent, almost always bohemian: a world from herserious performances.

Sangeetha is at her best when she reveals her character in glimpses, and not in gushes. I am thinking here of Saptha Kanya, Duwata Mawaka Misa, Dorakada Marawa, and Salelu Varama, as opposed to, say, Maruthaya, Sewwandi and Kinihiriya Mal. Its a subtle difference you see between these, yes, but its a
difference nevertheless. 

I cant explain why, or for that matter how, but as an actress Sangeetha never sticks to one mould. Unlike most actresses from her generation, she does not conform to one set of characterisations
As the years move on, she becomes more and more assertive from the start of the movies shes in, thereby keeping us from expecting anything new. It was difficult, for instance, to imagine Deepthi in Saptha Kanya to be anyone other than the pickpocket she is till the end, just as it was difficult to imagine Subashini in Dorakada Marawa to be anyone other than the tormented, victimised spurned lover she was until her death. But the same cannot strictly be said of her character in, say, Kinihiriya Mal, where her rebelliousness comes out (in gushes) even before she turns to prostitution. 
That sort of openness is what pits her against the more controlled Yashoda Wimaladharma in Guerrilla Marketing, particularly when her character learns that Yashodhas character was in love with her husband (Kamal). Its a clash between two schools of acting, not just actors, and while I wont say which one triumphs over the other, I will say that throughout this phase of her career, Sangeetha refuses to let her characters cower before the brunt of the world so much that she ends up revealing her entire self to us, warts and all.

Sivasakthi Ananthan not bound by TNA stance: EPRLF
	
Eelam Peoples Revolutionary Liberation Front (EPRLF) MP Sivasakthi Ananthan is not bound by the stand taken by the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) on the current political crisis though it was an ally of it, a party official said today.
The TNA has taken up the position that the sacking of UNP leader Ranil Wickremesinghe from the office of Prime Minister was unconstitutional and would support a no-confidence motion to unseat new Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa. It commands the support of 16 MPs.
Meanwhile one of them has defected from the TNA and taken oaths as a minister of the new government.
EPRLF also has one MP elected on the TNA ticket. Party leader Suresh Premachandran told Daily Mirror that Mr. Anandan was not be bound by the TNAs position. He said the EPRLF kept on observing the developments before taking any decision.
We are watching how things unfold, he said.(Kelum Bandara)

SL's Political crisis - Lord Naseby unhappy over Sir Hugo Swires statement
	
Commenting on the political situation in Sri Lanka, British Parliamentarian Lord Naseby has said he was unhappy that former British junior minister put down a question suggesting what happened in Sri Lanka was unconstitutional.
That is not the law, I believe, of the UK Parliamentarian. You have your own Constitution. I have been very careful in my fifty years of service. I have never been supporting any one party nor doing any business. I would suggest my colleague that they should do exactly the same, he said.
Former Foreign Secretary Sir Hugo Swire in the House of Commons earlier drawing attention to the political crisis in Sri Lanka asked the Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt to point out to the Sri Lankan President that the international community recognizes Ranil Wickremesinghe as the legitimate Prime Minister of Sri Lanka and only a vote in parliament can change his status.

Speaker has taken a stand: Now the intl community should follow suit
	
After a long and rather undue wait, Speaker Karu Jayasuriya yesterday announced that the arbitrary sacking of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and appointment of Mahinda Rajapaksa in his place as unconstitutional. Noting that it is the view of the majority that the recent changes effected by the president are unconstitutional and carried out in violation of parliamentary traditions, the Speaker informed the president that I would have to continue with the previous statuses in Parliament until a clear majority was shown in Parliament as a majority of the MPs had requested him to accept the previous composition.
However, the Speaker is also helpless before a vast apparatus of partisan acolytes in the bureaucracy and law enforcement services. Even after he announced his decision, Dinesh Gunawardene, who was named the Leader of the House by his party, forced open the doors of his new office and assumed duties in a position that he was never officially appointed. For the moment, Constitution in Sri Lanka stands suspended, and grossly abused. Independent institutions are subjugated. The state has been captured through political thuggery and abuse of power.
Maithripala Sirisena and Mahinda Rajapaksa have pulled off a sinister gimmick that their kind in Venezuela,Nocalas Maduro and Nicaragua,Daniel Ortega resorted in recent times, with the dual use of misappropriated powers in their offices and thuggery. This high-handedness is unlikely to be subdued. Instead, they will spike it up, with the hope that the UNP, especially its leader Ranil Wickremesinghe, whose resolve for a full blown showdown is in doubt, would give up.
The Speakers notice nonetheless provides constitutional grounds for the continuation of Ranil Wickremesinghe and his cabinet. If the UNP leadership really wants to make use of this opening, it should now be prepared to play the hardball politics. Its ministers should go and reclaim their ministries. If the UNP wants to fight this out that requires some real guts, which could probably transform the party itself. 
That would cause chaos, and inevitable violence. That is after all a necessary cost the parties that strive to restore democracy should be prepared to pay. Democracy in this part of the world has not been given in a platter; it has always been won through tremendous sacrifice, though these very nations have subsequently failed to sustain their democratic achievements.
Now Sri Lanka has two parallel governments. One which does not command the support of the majority of the House and is appointed by a self-serving presidency. The other was unconstitutionally sacked by the same president, who has no constitutional prerogative to sack a sitting prime minister. Nor has that government been challenged by a no- confidence motion, or ceased to function by any other means as stipulated by the Constitution.
The President has plunged the nation into its worst ever crisis in recent times. His arbitrary sacking of the government came days after the Lonely Planet declared the country as the best travel destination for the year 2019. Since then a host of European countries and America have issued travel advisories on Sri Lanka. A mega development grant of US$ 460 million by the United States Millennium Challenge Cooperation is now hanging in the balance. The grant, first of its kind to Sri Lanka was to be spent on upgrading road transportation and bus services in Colombo over the next five years. The US bilateral co-operation has hinted that current political development has stymied the process. 
Meanwhile, Japan International Corporation Agency (JICA) has suspended US$ 1.5 billion loan for the Colombo light railway project. If things come to crunch, Japan, the largest and most generous donor of all, would be the first to toe the Western line of approach towards Sri Lanka. To make matters worse, the European Union has warned that the country would lose GSP Plus trade concessions which have been a boon for the countrys garment industry.
All this is due to one mans greed for a second term in the office. Yet the President insists on proceeding with his ploy, dragging the entire country down with him. Courtesy of his selfish manoeuvering, Sri Lanka is now going through a phase of extreme manipulation and mechanization of the countrys democratic structure. Legitimacy of the elected office and public trust therein are seriously undermined.
Arbitrary prorogation of parliament is used as a breathing space to lure the opposition parliamentarians on the back of pecuniary inducements, allegedly as large as Rs.500 million. One by one MPs are fished out from the UNP and minority parties. This is not statesmanship, this is disgusting low life politics that the Third World is known for. People are forced to witness as their MPs sell their vote to the highest bidder. Both Sirisena and MR have taken an entire nation for suckers.
Manipulation is not limited to politics. Colombo Stock Exchange has been showing trading behaviour that cannot be rationally explained. Over Rs. 4 billion of foreign investment left the market just in a week since the appointment of MR, compared to Rs. 6 billion total foreign outflow during the first nine months. Despite the net selling by foreign investors during the past two weeks, market has gained a few notches aided by local buying. Though it sounds impressive the explanation lies in the reputation for wash-trading of the large politically connected local investors, whose illegal market practices have been kept under tab by the SEC in recent times. Now that the institutional integrity is undermined, usual culprits have resorted to the old means to give a feigned impression of investor confidence in the new government. It would not be long before these wash-traded stocks get dumped in the market, fleecing small investors who were gullibly bought into this ruse.
Sri Lankan economy had been going through a phase of painful economic restructuring. MR is now undoing that whole legacy for cheap political gain. Rupee depreciated by Rs.4 to the US$ within four days, and since then, the further slide is averted by selling foreign reserves. That is not economics, that is selling the future of this nation and its children.
It would not be long before, that the country lurches back to international isolation. Already, rhetoric is getting loud and ominous. Gotabhaya Rajapaksa, the Presidents adversary until two weeks back, and now probably the advisor, says that we dont have to reconvene Parliament just because foreign envoys tell us to do so. The usual conspiracy theories of foreign interference are making a comeback. Non existing threat of federalism is being dug out to use as a bogyman. Sri Lanka is being scarified on the altar to advance the political ambitions of a petty-minded few.
International community has a role to play. The announcement by the Speaker provides constitutional grounds for the civilized nations to recognize the previous status quo of Parliament. They should make their position loud and clear. Waiting on the sideline would see this country descended into one mans absolutism. Such a state is more likely to shun the civilized world, and bed with like-minded partners. That would mean, by waiting, the world community would also lose Sri Lanka.

Speaker's statement shows new Govt. is illegal: UNP
	
The United National Party (UNP) said yesterday, the statement made by Speaker Karu Jayasuriya that he would only recognise the status quo that prevailed in Parliament before the appointment of the new prime minister was an indication that the new government was illegal.
UNP Spokesman Harin Fernando told a media briefing that the Speaker had made it clear through his statement that the appointment of Mr. Rajapaksa was unlawful.
We are confident that those who crossed over to the other side would return to us as they would realize that they have accepted ministerial portfolios in an illegal government, he said.
MP Ajith P Perera said the Speaker had actually accepted that UNP Leader Ranil Wickremesinghe is the Prime Minister of this country till a new Member of Parliament manages to muster the support of a majority of parliamentarians.
As such the appointment of Mr. Rajapaksa and that of ministers and the others are null and void, he said.
Mr. Perera said the Speaker should convene Parliament at least on November 7 because he could do it based on the interpretation given by former Speaker Joseph Michael Perera in 2003 that the Prorogation of the House is done by the President not through his executive powers but as a matter of administration of the House. He said the Speaker could convene the House as he holds the administrative powers of Parliament. (Yohan Perera)

Sri Lanka: A Moment of Reckoning
	

The greatest upheaval ever known since this country regained political independence occurred just a few days ago. The event of appointment of a new prime minister and members of a new cabinet sent shock waves among all concerned citizens of this country and rightly so. The whole episode in this political scene has become a bone of contention with some defending the actions to be in accordance with the Constitution, hence legal while some others argue these decisions as blatantly unconstitutional and illegal. As a result, it follows that democracy is at stake and is being put to severe test and in the brink of danger. The international community watching this incredible scene is putting Sri Lankan political authorities under pressure to keep acting in respect of the Constitution of the country and thus preserve democracy honouring peoples verdicts.
It is very sad, discouraging and enerving that over a long period of time, things have taken such a turn in the inner sanctum of those in the seats of the highest power that led to this shocking impasse. Had those in the Good Governance Coalition given serious thought to the contradictions they were experiencing and the difficulties encountered in running the countrys democratic administration, this tragedy would not have happened. With this catastrophe, the entire country has come to a halt lacking sufficient time even to put things right which involves solving immediately the political and the economic crisis, lowering the standard of living and reviewing the taxes. These factors are radically needed to have a country at peace and contented. The fact, that the situation had deteriorated to such an extent as to put these things in jeopardy in national life, leaves all of us in a state of dismay and bewilderment.

Our good name was scarred in the international scene and the war-crimes charge was hailed at us, an issue over which we are still battling for clearingour name
The Good Governance government should have known better how to conduct its affairs in patience and wisdom realizing that parties in the coalition are multiple and that there needs to be cooperation and collaboration in all fronts to keep their governance stable. Coalitions always run the risk of breakdowns unless the parties involved are ready to keep steady despite difficulties and differences they might eventually encounter in running a government together. This is evident given the fact that parties in coalition are always from different political persuasions and they need to some extent compromise and find a common course of action in the interest of the common good of the people whom they are striving to serve thus creating an even field. Politics is no game for politicians only to play as they want with scant attention to the sorry plight of the people. They are elected representatives to care for their interests. Sovereignty rests in the people: the country belongs to the people. Politicians represent the hopes, aspirations and dreams of the people. It is them that they represent in the august chambers of democracy: the parliament and the cabinet on the national level. One must argue convincingly about their commitment to work for the common good of the citizens, irrespective of all differences.
Sri Lanka has seen diverse vicissitudes of politics of all colours for the last seven decades of her national life. It has taken stock of the turnings and twisting of political leadership that often times left the people in utter confusion and anger on the one hand, and on the other, insincerity, lack of authenticity, bribery, lying, cheating and corruption kept deranging the nations march towards prosperity and progress. Those who wielded power at the expense of the peoples vote must render an account for this national disaster. Many lament the shocking speed at which Sri Lanka had deteriorated in the last few decades in comparison with other Asian countries that have prospered in leaps and bounds. Once in the dust of ashes, they have now risen to be economic giants in the continent. Their forward-march will indeed impact the international scene in the decades to come.
We have had serious problems during this post-independence period. The most crucial were the ethnic tensions that caused conflagration in violence many a time. These were black events. One remembers the ethnic riots of the late fifties that eventually led, little by little to an armed conflict that struck this poor country which could not afford dumping its little resources on heavy arms. We are not a country trained for war or a war-type culture or ethic. Our religions abhor violence and destruction of life and property. It is the dhamma-deepa of non-violence and metta, this august historical seat of Theravada Buddhism that we are so proud of. How come, it has turned to be a land of cheating, lying, fraud, violence and confrontation many a time How come our politicians have grown to be a breed of irresponsible leaders who dare squander the assets of this beautiful country graced with so much of natural resources and an impeccable culture of our noble people How come that politics in this country had gone in the wrong direction of party-politics that confuses our people even today. When they read our newspapers, the common man in the village and in the fields will go into tantrums of confusion not knowing what is happening to their dear motherland! May be those in the cities and those in high ranks of the social class will conveniently overlook this plethora of media reports and just turn a blind eye to the events that have overtaken us.

Many lament the shocking speed at which Sri Lanka had deteriorated in the last few decades in comparison with other Asian countries that have prospered in leaps and bounds
This country has had serious set-backs from the time of the short-lived SWRD epoch that despite its seductive socialism was rocked by a number of hartals and strikes destabilizing the normal functioning of a peoples government. Then came a period of lull but yet with unstable governments. Finally came the poor era of the 1970s to be quickly overturned by one of open economy, free-trade zones and accelerated hydro schemes. While there were no multiple mega-projects, the Premadasa-era brought economic projects and awakening to the villages to be matched with a fitting educational programme to the rural youth. In the meanwhile the ethnic conflict raised its head once again and devoured this country for three-decades. It was a time of utter disaster and catastrophe to the island nation. It brewed through a terribly misguided ethnic and language policy.
Our good name was scarred in the international scene and the war-crimes charge was hailed at us, an issue over which we are still battling for clearing our name. With people unsteady with their choice at the ballot, two major parties decided to form a national government in order to wrest the country of the economic crisis, political instability and work hard to regain the lost name in the international scene. This succeeded to some extent. But much of the bribery and corruption within the country could not be tackled and ideological differences within the leaders of the national government became so intense that radical changes were carried out in the seats of power. With this situation oppressing us, we are at present in a state of bewilderment as to where truth and justice are resting.
Both sides of the divide argue equally strongly in favour of their opinions: some for constitutionality/legality of the changes made by the Head of State and the others condemning the outrageous nature, as they say, of the changes that are clearly un-constitutional. In any case, democracy is in a lamentable crisis in the country at the moment. Many politicians and legal experts propound three alternatives to get over the impasse that inundates the country today: either take the matter to the courts and argue for the illegality of the political decisions taken or consult the parliament in an early and emergency session or consult the people for a new choice of theirs in a referendum or a parliamentary election. All these three it is argued are legitimate. The fact of the matter is that the crisis being acute, a delay in its solution is going to cost the nation great harm and continue to tarnish our international image because the international community tends to see in Sri Lanka the emergence of a political dictatorship that flouts the will of the people and the right they have to a government that governs in fairness and justice. The sudden change in the office of the Prime Minister remains the bone of contention.
What do the people expect in this situation of uncertainty and national disaster At all costs a chaotic situation has to be avoided. The normal affairs of the government in maintaining peace and order in public life have to be secured. The political leaders at the helm must act with restraint and with immense wisdom and foresight so that the country does not plunge into a worse state of disaster. As soon as possible, the confusion had to be taken head-on and with great humility on the part of everyone. This is not the time to fish in troubled waters. Many pundits will come out with a plethora of opinions presuming to solve the riddle. At this moment, common sense and love for the country must take primacy among all: politicians and the masses at large. Both these sectors are responsible to bring back peace, order, harmony and prosperity to the motherland. 

What do the people expect in this situation of uncertainty and national disaster At all costs a chaotic situation has to be avoided. The normal affairs of the govt in maintaining peace and order in public life have to be secured
All right-thinking citizens must become aware and understand the serious nature of the crisis that has overtaken us. While the political leaders have to cease playing games, the civil organizations and the religious leadership of the country must intervene to indicate the proper path to tackle the crisis. What is at stake is not in the choice of a leader who can stem the tide and free the country from it political exile , but the right choice of the people who need to act in a mature way to opt for a salutary change that will augur well for themselves and their future posterity. Nothing can be achieved with political instability and an ailing economy. A sound economy cannot be built with a status-quo experiencing constant political instability. One depends on the other. This is the twin-challenge that politicians and people at large face today.
The choice is ours to patiently and wisely tackle this phenomenon. Together we will go to a strong future full of promise or together we will crumble as a country. The hour is come for a serious reckoning. Beyond all petty vested interests and greed for power, this is the moment to act with a sense of responsibility inspired by a true patriotic love and concern for the good of the motherland. If all act tactfully and prudently, the immense constitutional crisis can be transformed into a moment of opportunity.

They want to have the cake and eat it also!
	
Certain Diyawanna politicos have become veritable magnets attracting peacock-note bundles these days.

Most of them seem inclined to decide on the direction of their political journey depending on the source from which they get the heavier bundle.
Some of the politicos, who have attracted bundles from both directions are said to be either marking time or are caught in a state of indecision.
Though these people welcome the immediate fortune, they do not want to risk their political future, a political observer said.

United National Party (UNP) Leader Ranil Wickremesinghe failed to serve the Tamil people though the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) stood by him for more than three years, Deputy Minister of Regional Development (Eastern) S. Viyalendiran said today.
Addressing a media briefing held at the Prime Ministers Office, he said the North and East should be developed first and then they can focus on finding solutions to the national question.
The Eastern Province was ignored during the Ranil Wickremesinghe-led government. The Northern and Western Provinces have development ministries but the Eastern Province does not. Therefore, I requested the President to appoint me as the Development Minister for the Eastern region, Viyalendiran said.
He said though there was a project to build 50,000 housing units in the North, not a single unit was built during the previous governments tenure and said he joined the government on a request made by President Maithripala Sirisena.
This does not mean I support Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa, he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

US to exempt China, India, Japan from Iran oil sanctions: Pompeo
	
WASHINGTON AFP Nov5, 2018-The United States will exempt China, India and Japan from oil sanctions on Iran, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Monday, while vowing to be relentless in pressuring Tehran.
Hours after sweeping sanctions were reimposed following the US withdrawal from a denuclearization deal, Pompeo said eight countries would be at least temporarily exempt from the ban on buying Iranian oil due to special circumstances or so as not to disrupt energy markets.
The countries with the waivers will be China, India, Italy, Greece, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Turkey, Pompeo said.
Our objective is to starve the Iranian regime of the funds it uses to fund violent activity throughout the Middle East and around the world. Our ultimate goal is to encourage them to abandon their revolutionary course, Pompeo told reporters.
A notable omission was Iraq. Had Iraq been granted a waiver, Iran might have been able to skirt sanctions by mixing its crude with its neighbours output, analysts say.
President Donald Trump withdrew in May from the deal that his predecessor Barack Obama had reached with Iran, calling it a failure because it addressed only the clerical regimes nuclear programme.
Pompeo reiterated demands for Iran to make a 180-degree turn from its regional policies rooted in the 1979 Islamic revolution, such as support for the Lebanese militia Hezbollah.
We hope a new agreement with Iran is possible, but until Iran makes changes in the 12 ways I listed in May, we will be relentless in exerting pressure on the regime, Pompeo said.
Pompeo said the eight countries exempted have already demonstrated reduction of Iranian crude over the past six months and, indeed, two of those eight have already completely ended imports of Iranian crude and will not resume as long as the sanctions remain in place. We continue negotiations to get all of the nations to zero, he said.
Pompeo also said without specifying that the United States would exempt three non-proliferation projects underway in Iran from the sanctions.

## Title: Where is the SLFP of Bandaranaikes  
## Section: News Features

Where is the SLFP of Bandaranaikes  
	

All who led the party since Sirimavo are indebted to answer


By Bandaranaikes, I mean, SWRD and Madam Sirimavo  and not their off-spring who interfered with the smooth operation of Party machinery and initiated its descending path making the task easier for the successive leaders to cause imminent destruction; and going by the LG election results, even cause a natural death at the next General Election.
Bandaranaikes wanted a practical third route along which social justice, democracy, and development could be achieved. They respected democracy to the letter except in one instant when Sirimavo violated all norms in extending the term by two years in 1975. Bandaranaikes did not bring disrepute to the party by entertaining through back-door losers rejected by people not only to sit in Parliament but offering Cabinet Ministerial positions.
When SWRD felt things in the grand old party was not in his favour he was bold enough to stand up and quit the party and create a condition that cemented a two-party system, a necessary ingredient for a proper functioning of parliamentary democracy.
As Daily Mirror reported on the 22nd instant, during a ceremony held at the BMICH to commemorate four Senanayakes namely DS, Dudley, RG and FR who had played great roles in securing independence, President Maithipala Sirisena observed, The late D. S. Senanayake, did not engage in corruption, did not waste public funds. He was patriotic and adopted home-grown agricultural policies. This is why the UNP became a great party. The UNP was built upon the visions of these great men. I hope the UNP would find greatness again and become the real party which was founded by these leaders.
However, the current political turmoil has changed the scenario; the SLFP is in alliance with De facto SLPP leader Rajapaksa who assumed as PM. The massive show of strength around the banks of Diyawanna on Monday with Maroons overwhelmingly disappointing the Blues speaks a lot on the future of the 68-year-old party.
The Attanagalla stronghold of Bandaranaikes, which they won by majorities of over 30,000 and 45,000 was lost to a three-month-old party at February 10 Local Government election under the leadership of current President and, the SLFP organizer for the electorate, and former President Chandrika Kumaratunga. The segments of the privileged and the increasing middle class aspiring to political control were without the resources of realising their aspirations. Bandaranaike was motivated in to back their cause and his project turned out to be an instant hit. Within a few years, he travelled a long distance on a wave of popularity to control an alliance of forces on the same line of thinking and ideas. Positioned in a left-of-the-centre point on the political variety, the SLFP represented more on the aspirations of those who comprised the support base of the Marxists and the result was a rise in of progressive actions such as nationalization which carried the party close to the rural population and the urban middle class. They constituted what Bandaranaike termed the Pancha Maha Balavegaya [Bikkhus, Ayurveda physicians, teachers, peasants and labourers], which carried him to power in 1956. This political mutually beneficial association between the SLFP and Marxists remained intact for long periods.

Bandaranaikes wanted a practical third route along which social justice, democracy, and development could be achieved. They respected democracy to the letter except in one instant when Sirimavo violated all norms in extending the term by two years in 1975. Bandaranaikes did not bring disrepute to the party by entertaining through back-door losers
Sirimavo Bandaranaike, affectionately known by people as something, was the most charismatic and female leader in Sri Lankan politics; the male being Rajapaksa. She succeeded her husband SWRD and came to power in an era where women were not prominent in world politics. She holds the honour of the worlds first female Prime Minister. Her era in office led to the best times of Sri Lankas foreign relations. She did not accuse intelligence agencies of foreign nations of conspiring to assassinate of our leaders or plotting to change regimes.
The two senior Bandaranaikes have left indelible recollections of Sri Lanka in the world map with their middle-path foreign policy. Sirimavo actively involved herself in the non-aligned summit and also mediated the peace talks at India-China border conflict in 1962; made it an easy task for both China and India to the negotiable table due to cordial affiliation she maintained with these two nations and the regard she had from leaders of both countries.
The Sri Lanka Freedom Party that was formed a few months before [September 1951] scored an island-wide percentage of 15.5 votes at the 1952 May Parliamentary election. Even when it suffered its worst loss in the history in 1977, the percentage never dropped below 30 percent. However, after celebrating the 66th year in existence and ruling the country for thirty-five years the party ended with a dismal 13 percent, [both SLFP and UPFA added together].
Presidential election held on January 8, 2015, the Common Opposition candidate Sirisena who defected his party to contest against his partys nominee scored largely assisted by the 37 percent UNP plus 5 percent JVP votes. He also received 8-10 percent floating votes. While Sirisena scored heavily in North-East and upcountry constituents, which traditionally are UNP or Minority Party votes but certainly not of SLFP. Leaving out those mentioned Maithris SLFP could muster only a pathetic less than 2 percent of the total. The analysis of results reveals the outcome of both the elections held in 2015 January and August: it proves that meagre percentage of 10-12 percent SLFP vote that he was able to muster in Polonnaruwa Districts [20,000 approx.] along with some support from [about 3000 votes] he gathered from his birthplace in Gampaha electorates Yagoda. The situation has changed drastically over the past 10 months in favour of SLPP. Surely, with three years of being President and with his consolidation of power as party leader, but as per the grass-root level SLFPer, there is a significant shift in current position. The large majority of the genuine SLFP supporters of Bandaranaike fame are excitedly waiting for an occasion to teach a lesson to those who sold the party to the traditional opposition. All the SLFP top-rankers that supported Sirisena at January 8, for personal reasons lost at the August election; why did he bring back them to parliament though legitimately permitted, but in an unconvinced manner Havent some of them back-stabbed him Such deeds and his virtual failure to execute unwaveringly have badly watered down his influence as a leader. Clearly, the President has exposed himself as someone motivated by political convenience.
If a political party does not have its foundation in the determination to advance a cause that is right and that is moral, then it is not a political party; it is merely a conspiracy to seize power.Dwight D Eisenhower, March 6, 1956
Where is the Sri Lanka Freedom Party of Bandaranaikes
Who can retrieve, restore and reinstate the Sri Lanka Freedom Party back to its glory SLFP with make-shift arrangements, temporary appointment of scores of men as vice presidents or assistant secretaries for short periods and is undecided on the consummation of marriage with the United National Party which is equally inundated with its own share of tribulations, is heading for a natural death.
Fallen ill following an assault it received from its own General Secretary in Nov 2014, and repeatedly thrashed by the same man on the first round held on Jan 8, 2015, who ironically became the new boss and clamped down a near-fatal blow on it by declaring just before the second round in August same year, that an off-spring of it will not be sworn in as number two even if it succeeds; and the dethroned boss adding insult to injury by proposing to a new bloom, has destroyed, disintegrated and devastated the 68 years young Party. Continuing treatment may result in prolonging the process of dying. Sri Lanka history, however, is not littered with deceased political parties. The seriously ill patients loved ones are thinking of life support systems, especially the Group-15  but the patient does not seem to wake up enough to breathe on his own.
Sympathisers, if there are any, they can rescue the dying patient who now take shallow breaths with periods of no breathing for a few seconds to a minute, experiencing rapid shallow panting which are common end-of-life signs and symptoms by rushing it to a sanatorium for emergency resuscitation by the dethroned old boss who is heading the Pohottuwa.
