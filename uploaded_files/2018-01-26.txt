Backing independent groups won?t help political parties: EC
	
Though some political parties which got their nomination lists rejected backed Independent groups, members of the elected Independent group could not be replaced by members of any other political party, the Election Commission (EC) said yesterday.
The commission made this statement in the wake of Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) which got its nomination list rejected for Maharagama Urban Council announcing that it backed an independent group for the UC.
Additional Elections Commissioner, Saman Sri Ratnayake explained that no candidate could resign from contesting until the election is held.
?If a candidate resigned after being elected to a Local Government (LG) body, he or she would only be replaced by the next in line of the respective party as published in the party?s nomination list. No member from other political parties would be appointed to the vacant post,? he told the Daily Mirror. (Darshana Sanjewa)

Be long-sighted and clear-headed at LG poll: Mangala
	
Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera yesterday said he believed that it is important to be long-sighted and clear-headed about the monumental choice facing all Sri Lankans at the upcoming Local Government (LG) election.
Issuing a statement ahead of the LG election, Minister Samaraweera reiterated that it was an election that would decide if democratic institutions and traditions, painstakingly rebuilt since January 2015 would be torn down and laid to waste again.
?It is an election that will determine if Sri Lankans will live free or under the yoke of fear, impunity and grotesque abuse of power by a single family and its henchmen. As memory fades and we are embroiled in the politics of the present, it is easy to forget that once, not so many years ago, a government shot and killed its citizens for the crime of demanding clean water,? he said.
He said the local government election on February 10 was much more than a regional contest to capture political power in urban and municipal precincts.
?It is an old regime?s first real attempt to recapture power and restore an old, corrupt and dictatorial order. Disillusioned by the road ahead, which seems fraught with difficulty and the potential for, lost opportunity, this constituency may waver. But I believe it is important to try and build on what has already been achieved and keep the window open for peace and change. I believe it is important to have a long memory,? he said.
Minister Samaraweera said we need to ask ourselves, where all the white vans have gone and where have the grease yakas gone?
?We must question why the Government?s political critics and dissidents are not being thrown in jail. Why journalists are not being abducted or killed. Remember the night races ? the gift of an indulgent father who wielded all the power of his presidential office to ensure his Sons could have a good time? Remember the time when young men paid with their lives for the crime of being a rugby rival? Remember how it was impossible to speak openly about the excesses of the ruling family?,? he said.

Beating the illusions associated with knowledge
	
?
Peptic ulcers are wounds in the surface lining of your stomach, causing severe burning sensation. In addition, they may cause bleeding by eroding into blood vessels and is known to cause fatal massive hemorrhages in some patients. Until very recently, doctors thought that the sole cause for peptic ulcers was mental stress. So the treatment of choice for patients diagnosed with peptic ulcer disease at that time was antidepressants, and ultimately, surgery to remove the diseased stomach. So when Dr?s Barry Marshall and Robin Warren made a claim that these ulcers were not, in fact, caused by stress, but by a bacterium, instead of it being openly received, they were looked down with skeptism, and at times, were ridiculed openly.? ?
?Stomach ulcers made by bacteria?? queried critics. ?Everybody knows that the environment in the stomach is so acidic that a bacterium cannot survive within!? But the two doctors were not to be discouraged. They stood by their theory and went on to prove it to the world, leaving us with another inspiring story of fighting for what you believe in, even when the whole world stands on the other side, ready to laugh at you at the slightest mistake. This is the story of the Dr.S Marshall and Warren, and the small bacterium, Helicobacter pylori, the discovery of which revolutionized the fate of medicine.? ?
?
The Beginning
30-year-old Dr. Marshall was doing his clinical rotation in Royal Perth hospital in Australia, when he stumbled onto the path of Dr. Robin Warren, who was a pathologist. He had recently studied several tissue samples taken from the stomach lining of patients who were having peptic ulcer disease, and unbelievably, had observed a new type of bacterium on many of the samples.? ?
?This picked Marshall?s interest because among the patients that Warren treated he found the new bacterium. The patient was experiencing unbelievable stomach pains which did not respond to treatment. They ultimately had to refer her to a psychiatric. She was given antidepressants because they suspected the usual culprit ?stress? caused her stomach pains. So began their partnership, with years of laboring over the mysterious organism and if it had any relationship with peptic ulcers, ahead of them.? ?
?
Roadblocks
By 1982, the two doctors had spent hundreds of hours in a lab, looking under a microscope or in a clinic, examining patients with stomach ulcers, that they were certain that they had found the link between the bacterium and peptic ulcers. They decided that it was time to share their findings with the rest of the medical community; especially because with their new finding, instead of letting the patient experience the risk of surgery, they could cure the disease simply by eradicating the organisms through a course of oral antibiotics.? ?
But the majority of the medical community, including the seasoned gastroenterologists, flatly refused to deviate from what they?ve believed throughout their carriers, that peptic ulcers are induced by too much stress, sometimes going as far as to ridicule the two doctors.? ?
?In addition, according to Dr. Marshall, due to the commonness of the peptic ulcer disease at the time, there were many companies in the medical field which earned millions because of the disease. They sold equipment that were used to perform surgery, and drugs which were mostly ineffective, to the patients. These companies lobbied against the doctors, safeguarding their profits being their singular priority.? ?
?
Challenge accepted
The only way forward seemed to be by proving to the world once and for all that H. pylori indeed cause peptic ulcer, through infecting a healthy subject with it. Numerous previous attempts to infect animal models with the pathogen had failed, and it was unethical to use a human subject to intentionally cause him harm by infecting him with bacteria. So Dr. Marshall did the unthinkable, and made himself the test subject of his experiment. He underwent an endoscopy to prove that he was uninfected, and afterwards, drank a broth containing H. pylori, taken out from another patient?s stomach and cultured in the lab.? ?
The results appeared sooner than he imagined. He had bloating and abdominal pain by the fifth day and had severe vomiting in another two. The symptoms worsened in the coming days. He suffered through the pain for fourteen days, without taking medication, only to take another biopsy, which to his utmost pleasure, was positive for the bacteria.? ?
?
Nobel Prize
Now that they had absolute proof, they again published their findings, which changed the lives of so many people. Today, the accepted treatment for peptic ulcer disease is antibiotics, coupled with a drug which reduces stomach acidity.? ?
The two doctors won the Nobel prize for medicine in 2005, and in his speech on receiving the prize, Dr. Marshall quoted Daniel Boorstin?s saying ?The greatest obstacle to knowledge is not ignorance; it is the illusion of knowledge?. He explained that the reason so many specialists in the field were bind to the true cause of peptic ulcer, was because they believed they already knew the cause, and refused to think beyond what they were taught.? ?
In addition to their contribution to medicine, Dr?s Warren and Marshall are another example of people who achieved greatness by going against the view of the majority, determinedly following what they believed was right, until the very end.? ?
?
?
About H. pylori
Helicobacter pylori is a small ?S? shaped bacterium which lives in the extremely acidic stomach mucosa. They have an enzyme which produces ammonia, neutralizing the acid layer around them. This also damages the upper lining of the stomach, which is resistant to acid, allowing the stomach acid to leak in and cause peptic ulcers. In addition to being the major cause of peptic ulcers, H. pylori also cause duodenal ulcers and are known to cause cancers in the stomach in the long term.

Beijing, (Hindustan Times), 25 Jan 2018 -? The Chinese military on Thursday criticised the Indian Army chief?s remarks referring to Doklam as disputed territory and warned India to learn ?lessons? from last year?s standoff near the Sikkim border so that similar incidents do not occur in future.??
In its first response to Gen Bipin Rawat?s remarks on the standoff, the People?s Liberation Army contended Doklam or Donglang is part of China. The PLA also said Rawat?s comments showed Indian troops had illegally crossed into Donglang.??
The 73-day standoff had pitted border troops from the two countries against each other from June to August-end. It ended when both sides agreed to pull back their forces from the area that is under Chinese control but claimed by Bhutan.??
?I have noticed many of the Indian journalists? remarks (on Rawat?s comments). Donglang is part of China and the remarks of the Indian side also shows the illegal border crossing of the Indian troops is clear in fact and nature,?

Don?t create political turmoil ? PM
	
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe yesterday requested people in the country not to invite political turmoil by handing over the responsibility of running the local authorities to another party which does not administer the Central Government.
Mr. Wickremesinghe made this remark at the UNP election rally in Badulla last evening. ?It is the UNP-led government which is running the show today and it would be possible to develop the village only if we are given the task of running local bodies. Therefore, it is better to give us the chance of administering the local bodies if you want your villages developed," the Prime Minister warned.
?If another party is given the opportunity of running local bodies that party could sabotage the development which the central government intends to implement. Just imagine what would happen to the country if such a situation arises, he queried.
The Prime Minister then went on to say that the central government intends to relocate the Badulla Prison and construct a tourism zone there thereby creating many employment opportunities for those in the area.
"However, the central government will not be able to relocate the prison if the Municipal Council of Badulla goes to another party as the party administering the council will not allow the central government to carry out its plan," he warned.
Minister Harin Fernando will be given a greater responsibility in the future including full powers to handle the development of Badulla, he explained.
He revealed that the development activities that will be carried out in Hambantota will be extended to the Uva Province as well. "We will develop Hambantota and Uva together," he said. (Yohan Perera in Badulla)

Donate blood! and save your fellow Citizens
	
?
Age ? 18 to 60? ?
Weight - not less than 55 Kg, The donor?
should be healthy? ?
Duration ? once in four months? ?
For regular donors, they have the approval to donate blood until they turn 60
?
The National?Blood Transfusion Service (NBTS)?recently announced?that the Blood Bank is facing a critical shortage of blood due to a lack of donors between January and April. Given this emergency situation, Health Capsule decided to inform the public as to how they can help save lives by donating blood.?
NBTS Deputy Director Dr. Deepa Saranajeewa said that the Special Government Campaign conducted by NBTS comes under the Ministry of Health. It is the sole supplier of blood and blood products to all government hospitals and the majority of private sector hospitals. There are around 100 hospital based blood banks operating all over the country. Depending on their geographic location they are divided into 19 clusters. One major blood bank within the cluster has been identified as the Cluster Centre.
National Blood Center (NBC) is the operational headquarters. Within NBC there are several departments and units; each playing its own distinctive role to assure the timely supply of quality assured blood and blood products and transfusion and offering transplant related services to the entire country.
Diseases, operations, and accidents require volumes of blood and other blood products. During an emergency for blood or other blood products, the blood bank is responsible to ensure that demand is supplied.?
?
Stocks decline?
NBTS collects approximately 400 to 450 thousand units of blood from voluntary blood donors all over the island. Usually every hospital blood bank and the National Blood Centre in Narahenpita encounters a drop in the supply of blood between January and April each year. Likewise this year the issue cropped prematurely, resulting in the blood stocks starting to decline from the beginning of this month.
?If Dengue pops up again, or if there is a need for a massive transfusion we will be facing an urgent requirement of blood and other components. Therefore every blood bank should maintain the minimum level of stocks in all blood groups. That?s why the doctors, public health inspectors and nurses in all blood banks are struggling to find donors between January and April each year. The blood bank staff in every blood bank throughout the country is ready to support any group, any organization willing to donate blood,? Dr. Saranajeewa explained.?
Any person who falls between the ages 18 to 60 years and possessing a body weight not less than 55Kg can be a voluntary blood donor. Also he shouldn?t have suffered an infection recently or received treatment for a chronic disease. Any person who had travelled abroad three months before the time of the donation will not be recommended to be a donor. Every donor can donate blood every four months. ?The most wanted blood types are A-, B-, O- and AB-. Negative blood type donors are less compared to the positive types we are getting regularly. Usually, we are supplying 300 - 350 red blood cell packets and 175-200 platelet packets per day to all hospitals in Colombo. To cater to this requirement, we need to collect blood daily from the donors,? she said.?
?
Organize a campaign
Be it race, religion or any personal cause, anyone can organize a blood donation campaign or donate their valuable blood to save lives, in their hometown or even in NBTS premises. The authorities at NBTS look forward to provide their services for such a cause. Before deciding the day for the donation campaign, the organizer will have to meet the medical officer in charge in their local blood bank and check the availability of a date since donor camps are organized months before an event. There?s a huge demand for blood donation camps to be organized during weekends and public holidays.
Therefore, checking the available date three months prior to a campaign is advised. Elaborating on the shortage of blood, Dr. Saranajeewa said, ?During the last two weeks and the end of December we had a low number of blood donors which resulted in a lesser amount of blood being collected. Some campaigns were cancelled due to the rules related to elections banning the gathering of people?. The Blood Bank requests the general public to donate blood as much as possible, immediately.
A voluntary donor can donate blood at the National Blood Centre in Narahenpita during any of the 365 days of the year between 8am to 6pm. However at other hospital based blood banks, donors are allowed to make their donations between 8am to 4pm. The campaign premises should be well-known to the public and the place should be peaceful and have a clean atmosphere, parking facilities and washrooms. NBTS provides the necessary equipment for blood transfusions. All the organizers will be called for a meeting prior to the event by the respective blood banks to make them aware of how to organize a blood donation camp. The NBTS doesn?t approve blood from donors who are not volunteers.? A successful blood donation campaign is a collective effort of several groups. Friends, sports clubs, volunteer organizations, Government, and non ? government organizations can organize donor campaigns. A weekday blood donation campaign should attract the participation of at least 100 people while a weekend campaign should attract around 200 donors. National Blood Centre and Cluster Centre blood banks have the capacity to conduct mass blood mobiles with the valuable participation of 1000 to 3000 donors.
The NBTS maintains a donor registry which is used to call donors when blood is needed during an emergency. Anyone willing to donate blood can enter his or her name in the register at the NBTS.?
A voluntary blood donation is a valuable and precious gift a person could give willingly and help save millions of lives.

Fasting ok, but not skipping meals
	
?
How many times have you heard that ?breakfast? is the most important meal of the day? And how many times have you skipped breakfast after making an excuse of being late to work, school etc ? If you think you can make up for skipping a meal by eating more on the next one, think again.? Health Capsule got in touch with Dr. Damayanthi Perera, a nutrition specialist, in order to gain some insight on the subject. Here?s what she had to say,? ?
QIs skipping breakfast or dinner bad for your health?
It is well-known that skipping breakfast is not good because there is a long time gap between dinner and breakfast. It may lead to poor school performance in children and poor work performance in adults. This is why some Companies provide free breakfast to workers. Scientific studies show that this has a positive effect on the productivity of workers. Skipping dinner may lead to heart burn or gastritis in the long run. Instead of skipping dinner it is better to have a light meal.? ?
?
QWhat happens to your body when you skip?a meal?
If a person has little or no body fat (i.e. very skinny people) and glycogen stores (A small amount of glucose stored in the liver that could be used by the body, especially the brain, when the blood sugar level falls),? the body may not have adequate energy to function properly.? Such people may experience headaches, feel lethargic, drowsy, dizzy etc. You may have seen children fainting during school assemblies in the morning. However, today we are living in an era where people have energy in abundance, are overweight or are obese and it is less common to see such a scenario.? ?
?
QCan skipping meals help you lose weight?
Skipping meals is not a good way to lose weight. To lose weight one must follow a calorie reduced, balanced meal plan.? ?

If a person is on Insulin or Sulfonylurea drugs, it is not good to delay or skip meals because it can lead to hypo glycaemia or low blood sugar, which may create negative health effects. Sometimes, hypo glycaemia can be fatal.? ?
?
QWhy should you not skip meals?
In addition to the above reasons, when you skip a meal you are more likely to overeat at the next meal or indulge in unhealthy snacks.? ?
?
Q? What are the benefits of intermittent fasting?
Intermittent Fasting is an umbrella term for various diets that cycle between a period of fasting and non-fasting during a defined period.? Intermittent fasting has been proved to have a lot of health benefits,? ?Speaking further on Intermittent Fasting, the doctor said, ?I would also like to mention a few things about the other side of the equation; fasting.? There is a difference between skipping meals and fasting. As mentioned earlier,?
since we are living in an era of food and energy in abundance, ?planned? intermittent fasting can be very beneficial and healthy. Although intermittent fasting is now promoted as a Western Concept. Fasting is nothing new to Hindu, Buddhist and Islam followers. Christians also fast during certain religious festivals such as Lent.? ??As per the Buddhist ?Vinaya? (Code of Conduct for Monks) Buddhist monks and nuns are expected to refrain from partaking any meals after the mid-day meal. Lay Buddhists practice semi fasting during Sil (religious observances) on Full Moon (Poya) Days, meditation and retreats. The Middle Path refers to avoiding extremes. The Middle Path, preached by Gautama Buddha is now accepted as a highly scientific concept. Fasting is a practice that has been embedded in some religious and cultural practices. It is evident that our ancients were aware of the health benefits of fasting.? ?
?In India fasting is a common practice among Hindus, during religious festivals and also other times. Some Hindu women fast once a week. These fasts are ?planned? fasts and the person may fast the whole day, avoiding cooked meals, consuming only one meal or consuming some fruits and water. The energy deficit aids fat burning and weight management. These fasts will also help the organs such as the liver and the kidneys to have a rest or have a lighter work load. Due to the presence of anti-oxidants, vitamins, minerals and other beneficial phyto-chemicals (plant chemicals), fruit fasts help to detoxify and rejuvenate the body,? Dr. Perera said.?

Gentlest human being and a loving father
	
The versatile Film, Music, Journalistic and sports personality Premnath Moraes would have celebrated his 95th Birth Anniversary on January 31. We re-produce an article carried in the 150th Year Commemorative Publication of St. Benedict?s College.Singer, Songwriter, Lyricist. Actor, Film Director, Scriptwriter, Producer. Weightlifter, Wrestler, Footballer, Cricketer, Athlete, Gymnast Journalist, Sports Editor, Creative Head and Copywriter. Commentator and Silver tongued Orator.
Believe me, the list goes on.? ?
Renaissance Man?? Bohemian Artist? Yes to both, but to me, most importantly, the gentlest human being one could hope to meet and the most loving father my sister Rehani or I could ever have hoped to have .? ?
Premnath Joseph Moraes ? born Joseph Peter Moraes Fernando on January 31, 1923, was of solid middle class stock, who carried his simple and devout catholic faith right through life.? ?
In many ways he epitomized the essence of the very best of the Benedictine trademark ,with traits and talents that wove a rich tapestry of Arts, Sports, Humanity, Simplicity and a Christianity that was lived rather than preached.? ?
Abundantly blessed with talent and versatility, he was however trusting to a foolish degree and unfailingly gullible so as to be a target for exploiters and worse,resulting in the vicissitudes of economic circumstances. So it was not his largesse that beget the incredible goodwill he has left as his legacy to his Family, but rather a tribute from people of all walks of life to Premnath the man!.? ?
Talking of all walks of life, my Father trod many paths; a short outline of which I hope will make good reading.? ?
Joining the Police force soon after school, he was seconded to the CID and later advised to leave by a senior Police Officer after having spoken openly at the funeral of a colleague who had been gunned down when leading an unarmed raid on a den of vice.? ?
Thereafter he sought and secured a position as a Reporter with the Times of Ceylon after an interview with its Editor, Frank Moraes (father of the poet Dom), who reminded him that ?the coincidence of our surnames will remain just that!? .? ?
?Leaving the Times of Ceylon building , Premnath was almost knocked down by a vehicle driven by his friend Sangare Sellamuttu (later Mayor of Colombo ) with whom he then got chatting and informed him of the job he had just landed . ?What nonsense? said Sellamuttu , ?with your looks you should be in Films, let me introduce you to Sir Chittampalm Gardiner? ? good looks he had, no doubt about it, but rather than me being accused of understandably favourable bias let me quote the words used by the late, great Gamini Fonseka in a long, eloquent and emotional appreciation,? ?
?On those extra broad shoulders? ?
rested that handsome head? ?
of a barrel chested man? ?
with a wasp like waist? ?
His features stirred envy? ?
In the hearts of ?stars? of his day.?? ?
Young Premnath (a name he then?
assumed ) was signed on as an actor and thus started a romance with the film industry which lasted over 50 years ( from 1947 to 1998 , from starring in ?Kadawanu Poronduwa? (also known as Broken Promise) the 2nd Sinhala film to be produced, to Demodara Palama, circa 1997. Warada Kageda and Kapati Arakshakaya in the late forties were followed by several others .? ?
This was followed by a stint in Shanthiniketan the Centre of Arts north of Calcutta , the stay which was undertaken for purely aesthetic reasons, gave my father the most pleasant memories among which was seeing and hearing Maestro Ravi Shankar perform for over a hundred cumulative hours.? ?
The long visitation was in the company of his close friend Shanthi Kumar Seneviratne (Star and Director of Ashokamala ? the first Sinhala film).? ?
From Shanthenikitan, Premnath moved to Bombay where he was in the famed Raj Kapoor/Nargis circle , and was close friends of Dilip Kumar (Mohamed Yusuf Khan), and closer still to one of the most beautiful Hindi actresses of the time, whose gift to him ? a Gold , Universal Gen?ve watch , I wear to this day.? ?
Back to Ceylon , and the man took up to singing, was contracted to the HMV label (His Masters Voice) , recorded Solo, and with Latha (Walpola) and Chitra (Somapala), of the many recordings perhaps the most famed are ?Sri Lanka Rani Meniye? ( the de facto Catholic anthem of Sri Lanka) and ?Lak Deepe? .? ?
Here, permit me to express a son?s view albeit emotionally flavoured ; I truly believe that no one could sing Olu Pipila or Kokilayange KoKila Nade, better. Incidentally the great Sunil Shantha who immortalised these songs was also a Benedictine.? ?
?The Sri Lankan Nightingale Rukmani Devi once told me that she and her husband Eddie Jayamanne (both of whom were very close to him) used to badger my father to sing the 1939 classic ?Over the Rainbow? at every possible opportunity, and redoubtable fellow Benedictine Ben Navaratne (argued to be the best wicket- keeper Sri Lanka or Ceylon ever produced) used to always ask my father to promise to sing ?O Danny Boy? over his grave - very poignantly Ben Navaratne and Premnath Moraes are buried within yards of each other at the Jawatte Cemetery.? ?
On to 1953. Production Assistant (Titles were not grandiose in those days) and 2nd unit Director for Elephant Walk, Directed by William De Telle, the son-in-law of the legendary Cecil B De Mille (of Ten?
Commandments Fame) .? ?
Starring Vivien Leigh, Peter Finch and Dana Andrews - all Oscar Winners ?(Peter Finch and Dana Andrews later, Vivien had already won hers for Streetcar named Desire). Living at the Galle Face Hotel for a full nine months, interspersed with long stays at up country locations, my father enjoyed close interaction with the best acting talent the world had to offer, with the huge bonus of frequent visits from Laurence Olivier, probably the most acclaimed Thespian and Actor who was obliged to check on his wife Vivien, who succumbed to a nervous breakdown within the shooting.?
What is remarkable (given that this was 1953) is that Vivian?s condition was recognized , possible inability to proceed was anticipated, and EVERY scene was shot twice, one with Vivien Leigh, one without. So upon Vivien being unable to proceed with the film, the images of Elizabeth Taylor were superimposed ? without her ever having visited Ceylon. Not bad for 1953!? ?
Two short stints as 2nd unit Director for United Artists ?Captain?s Table? and ?Purple Plains? which starred Gregory Peck, on to India where he was Production Manager at Gemini Studios in Madras,where most of the Sinhala Films at the time were edited, dubbed and produced. Coincidentally his uncanny look alike the Tamil film star Gemini Ganeshan got his eponymous name through association with this studio.? ?
Wide varied and versatile though my father?s exposure to the celluloid world, in my opinion his single most significant to the Sinhala Cinema was his unremitting efforts to get Gamini Fonseka into it, culminating in a successful introduction to Lester James Peiris who brought Gamini into Rekawa in a non-starring role ? the rest ? to use a clich? ? is history!. Gamini never lost an opportunity to credit my father (whom he referred to as his ?guru?) with his entry to films, and Lester has also endorsed the fact over the years.? ?
?Ironically, given his long involvement with Sinhala Cinema, Premnath won the most kudos , and International and local acclaim for Directing the Tamil Film ?Vaadai Kaatru? in the seventies, shot on the arid dunes of Pesalai. As recently as the 26th of September 2015, that redoubtable and insightful journalist , DBS Jeyaraj referred to Vaadai Kaatru as ?probably the best Tamil Film? ever made in Sri Lanka .? ?
Now onto that integral part of Premnath?s being that merited his inclusion in this journal, Premnath Moraes the Benedictine.? ?
Spanning his entire school career (with a colourful rainbow of classmates who included Fr. Paul Caspersz, Dr. Reinzie De Silva and Ossie Corea), except for the last two years, (when St. Benedict?s moved to Veyangoda on account of WW 2 and my father?s family to their ancestral home in Negombo from where he attended Maris Stella).? ?
?He was very active in both sports and the arts, representing St. Benedict?s at Cricket and Soccer (his favourite sport, under Stanny Xavier) and as a Public Schools Athlete and was ?Baseman? in the walking Pyramid of the gymnastic Troupe commanded by the formidable George Atkinson, also in the same troupe was Malcolm Fernando, father of Nalake.? ?
To digress for a moment from St. Benedict?s, to maintain the thread of Sports, Premnath ? (at this point still known as JP Fernando or Joseph), captained football and played cricket for Maris Stella where he was appointed Head Prefect, and won the singular honour of National Colours while still a schoolboy, representing Ceylon against the Allies in weightlifting. Later on he was in training for the ?Mr Ceylon? contest when a fire broke out in the Regal Cinema complex where he had an apartment, the injuries he sustained in helping put out the fire also put paid to his chances of competing and some scars remained through life.? ?
Back to St. Benedict?s - Involved in Film and Music and living in Kotahena down Mayfield Road (next to Dudley Thambinayagam?s family), there came to be formed at my father?s home, a Sports Club circa 1948 ? euphemistically referred to as the MCC (Marylebone or Mayfield) as the case may be, detractors at the time claimed the CC stood for Cowshed Club, as the bowler on this rude pitch actually had to start his run up from within the shelter of the domestic milk provider .? ?
The Club became a nucleus for Benedictine social activity and my father was fond of recalling an instance where the entire Benedictine Football Team, returning from an ?away? victory was carried shoulder high from the Kotahena roundabout to his home, where a feast centered around green and white string hoppers laid out by my grandmother awaited them.? ?
My Father was the first General Secretary of the Old Bens Sports Club and served under the Presidencies of Col. Sydney Jayawardena, Dougie Livera and Granville Perera before taking over himself and being succeeded as Secretary by his friend and classmate?J.E. Benedict.? ?
Premnath worked tirelessly to support and build the fledgling club, and is credited with the initiation of the still vibrant Quadrangular Cricket Tournament. His roles were many, best exemplified by the manner by which different people recall his role as the annual College Sports Meets, many (as I do) remember him as the announcer, still others as the ?pistol toting? starter, whilst that great benefactor of the school Ratna Mallawaractchi , recalls him as the anchor man in the old boys vs staff?
tug-of-war , again typifying his versatility .? ?
Journalism next and the ?nume de plume? SEAROM (MORAES in reverse), is still remembered. His turn of phrase was fluent, lyrical and polished, and the rapier wit and thrust invariably found its mark in his- relished by many, dreaded by some column- ?petals and pellets?. Impartial though he was for the most part, he just couldn?t contain his support for the old school and the rampaging Old Bens Basketball and Hockey and Soccer Teams gave him plenty of grist for his mill.? ?
As a Sports administrator in Basketball and Hockey one of his proudest moments was when he was ?Chef De Mission accompanying the National Hockey Team to Delhi ? with no less than 6 Bens in it.? ?
What about Premnath the man? Impish in humour, gullible, ever willing to help, and never holding a grudge or remembering an injustice.? ?
I once came across a saying, ?There is nothing as strong as gentleness, and nothing as gentle as real strength?, this soft spoken, gentle man, at the height of the ?58 riots dressed up as a thug in a sarong and banian, trust a pistol into his belt and single handedly rescued an Indian film crew from a mob which had surrounded them in Kelaniya (a story told by others not him). He also ? himself a Tamil (though supra fluent in Sinhala) and 60 years old at the time guided a van-load of his office workers among them several Tamils, safe to their houses all the way to Panadura and back on that fateful Black Friday in ?83 ? and never spoke a word about what he had seen or experienced that dastardly day. This was my gentle father.? ?
I am a rare animal ? a 4th generation Benedictine, yet in College and all College related Fora I have no individual identity, I am still simply referred to as ?Premnath?s son? and for that I am ever so proud.? ?
Pradeep Moraes.? ?

Later 69 applicants with the requisite qualifications were interviewed and the most qualified seven were selected for appointment.?
Meanwhile, the purohita in charge of the Ministry sent for his secretary and gave him a list of seven names. ?These seven chaps are from my electorate. Appoint them to the seven vacant posts in the Ministry. Issue the appointment letters after the upcoming polls!? the purohita told him.??
The secretary nonplussed by this unexpected order said: ?But, Sir, this is quite irregular. These people didn?t even come for the interview!?

## Title: Handling the Thalassemia threat
## Section: Medicine

Handling the Thalassemia threat
	
?
There is a plethora of diseases that frustrates the balance of healthy living in the world today. Some may be curable whilst cures for others remain unknown. However the kinds of disorders that we have no control over makes the scenario quite unfortunate. Hereditary diseases come under this category.? ?
There are various hereditary conditions prevalent in Sri Lanka. Yet Thalassemia is considered the most common hereditary disease in the island. Dr. Lalindra Gooneratne, Senior Lecturer and Head of the Department of Pathology and Honorary Consultant Haematologist at the Faculty of Medicine of the University of Colombo, provided insight on Thalassemia, explicating it?s cause, symptoms, diagnosis and treatment.? ?
?
Dwelling Deeper? ?
?It has been said that approximately 60 new patients who suffer from major Thalassemia are born every year in the country and roughly 2000-3000 patients receive treatment for this condition at any given time. More cases are reported from districts like Kurunegala and Anuradhapura. However Dr. Gooneratne stated that there could be a drop in figures due to awareness being raised and the various treatment options available.?
?
?Thalassemia is a hereditary disease. A mutation in the genes lie responsible for causing Thalassemia,? said Dr. Gooneratne. He explained that when a child is born with just one mutated Thalassemia gene, the child becomes a carrier of the disease. However being a carrier does not mean that the child will suffer from Thalassemia. Though the child will carry the gene for the disease, he or she will be able to live a completely normal and healthy life, free of symptoms. ?If? the mutated Thalassemia gene is passed down from both maternal and paternal sides, the child will most likely become a Thalassemia patient,? he underscored.? ?
Haemoglobin is a pigment that is present in red blood cells. It gives the red blood cells their colour. More importantly it is responsible in the transportation of oxygen throughout the body. Dr. Gooneratne elucidated that Thalassemia is a blood disorder where an abnormal and reduced production of haemoglobin takes place, which consequently leads to anaemia.? ?
Haemoglobin consists of 2 components. ?Haem? which means iron and ?globin? a protein. The faulty gene responsible for causing Thalassemia affects the globin protein production. Accordingly Thalassemia is categorized into 2. ?There are 2 types of globin proteins, alpha proteins and beta proteins. A fault in the gene responsible in producing the alpha protein will result in the reduction of alpha globin production. This leads to alpha Thalassemia whereas a mutation in the beta protein producing gene will cause a reduction in beta proteins. This leads to beta Thalassemia,? explicated Dr. Gooneratne. According to the haematologist, the type of Thalassemia which is predominant in Sri Lanka is beta Thalassemia.? ?
?
Diagnosis
? Since Thalassemia is congenital, symptoms appear 3-6 months after birth. ?Infants will become pale, lethargic and inactive. The stomach will appear swollen. Such symptoms are warning signs to the parents to immediately seek medical attention,? he affirmed.? ?
Upon consultation , a blood test will be called for. Dr. Gooneratne stated that the haemoglobin level will be checked through the test along with the changes of a few other components before the condition is affirmed. HPLC which stands for High Performance Liquid Chromatography is available as the standard test for the diagnosis of thalassemia.? ?
?
Lifelong Treatment? ??
According to the Haematologist, when speaking on general terms, Thalassemia is a condition which requires lifelong treatment. However at present there appears to be a cure through bone marrow transplantation though this is a possibility only open to a minority of the patients. ?Treatment calls for the necessity of the patient to receive blood transfusions on a monthly basis. This is the main and most common treatment received by Thalassemia patients,? said Dr. Gooneratne.? ?
?
Consequential complications
However regular blood transfusions give rise to another complication. ?Due to the transfusion of blood and thereby haemoglobin to the patient, this ultimately leads to an increase in the iron deposit in the body. This is adverse to the health. Iron will get deposited in organs like the liver. The activity of the organs decrease and it could lead to fatality. If the excess iron is not removed, it could cause organ damage. Liver failure, heart failure and even diseases like diabetes are some of the consequences. Growth and development of the child would also be affected,? he accentuated. The doctor stressed that blood transfusions should be accompanied by parallel medication in order to remove the extra iron from the body.? ?
Although transfusions lead to such complications, it should be noted that they are a necessary part of the treatment. Dr. Gooneratne warned that if blood transfusions are not done, organs like the liver and spleen of the patient would swell. Dire consequences will follow. Therefore visits to the hospital for blood transfusions is important and must be accompanied by the removal of excess iron to avoid an iron build up in the body.? ?
?
Where there?s life, there?s hope? ?
Today Thalassemia patients in Sri Lanka can be assured that there is hope for life. ?Bone marrow transplantation is now an option. However it is more important to focus on reducing the occurrence of Thalassemia patients in future. Prevention is better than suffering through treatment later,? he mentioned. However as Thalassemia is a hereditary disorder, one might say it is up to fate and your genes to determine whether you contract the disease or not. There is a way through which the occurrence of Thalassemia in the country can be minimized. ?Carriers are people who are not in danger of the disease, but carry the faulty gene nevertheless. When 2 carriers marry and have children, there is a 25% probability that the child may fall victim to Thalassemia. Therefore before marriage it is advised to check for the presence of the faulty gene responsible in causing Thalassemia. It is just a matter of getting a blood test to determine the presence of the mutated gene,? Dr. Gooneratne said. This could help in the taking of better decisions and avoid an increase in Thalassemia patients. Increase in Thalassemia is a burden to the country as well as the patient and the family. It is costly for the country to provide the blood and necessary equipment for treatment with regard to the ascending numbers of patients. Meanwhile the patient suffers physically as well as emotionally throughout the disease. Therefore small steps taken to reduce such instances in future go a long way in creating a healthier nation.? ?

This politico, a quiet type, had been a longstanding loyalist of Number Two. However, his loyalty did not pay dividends when assigning portfolios; of course, he got a portfolio, but not the one he aspired to.?
?
The politico has his own way of registering his displeasure. His boss recently paid his first ever visit to his home turf since yahapalanaya taking office. His colleagues who attended this event brought large crowds of supporters with them. But this politico turned up at the event with a few supporters and made it a point to keep a low profile at the event, they say.?

As Karunawathie does not possess any Karunawa, Maithri also does not show any Maithri, said former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, speaking at a propaganda meeting held on Thursday in Dambulla.
He said though the President bears the name Maithri, he is not acting in accordance with his name but keeps expressing hate. He cautioned President Maithripala Sirisena not to be so aggressive when addressing political meetings in anger because it might make him sick. This meeting was held at the Dambulla Gam Udawa Sports Grounds in the presence of former minister Janaka Bandara Tennekoon and former minister Pramitha Bandara Tennekoon. Large crowds were present at this propaganda meeting.
The former president charged that Maithripala betrayed the policies of the SLFP and attempted to take credit for the Moragahakanda Scheme where 75% of the work had been completed under his government.
"Seeing the large crowds, our leaders would start blaming me but I am ever grateful to the President and the Prime Minister for promoting me and giving all this publicity," he said. (K. K. Ariyadasa)

Miraculous effects discovered by ancient seers
	
In the previous articles under the above subject, we discussed the different gems and precious stones recommended by ancient Indian Rishis for wearing on the body to ward off malefic influences caused by the nine planets to attract or enhance beneficial effects produced by them.?
Here we propose to discuss the favourable effects that can be derived from the use of different gems and precious stones irrespective of their virtues in relation to different planets.
?
Ruby?
Ruby is the gem recommended for wearing by ancient seers to ward off the bed effects caused by the afflicted Sun.? Ancient seers have recommended wearing Ruby to increase political prestige and power, enjoy good health and obtain relief from liver diseases.
There are three kinds of Ruby: Sugandhika, Kuruvenda and Padmaraga. The classical works on Ayurveda have recommended wearing Ruby to restore peace of mind, enhance the brain power and to regulate the circulation of blood in the body.? Ruby also serves as an antidote against blood poisoning, insect bites etc. It helps normalize the pulse rate.? If worn on a finger, Ruby prevents contracting cholera and if held in the mouth destroys the offensive breath.?
?
Pearl?
Pearl or Mukta is the gem of Moon. It is also recommended for deriving favourable effects from Jupiter. Pearl is the gem recommended for gaining affluence, peace of mind and popularity.?
In Ayurveda pearl is described as being cold and sweet (madhura). It is prescribed to cure eye troubles and also to use as an antidote for poison.??
Pearl brings fame, success and beauty.? It is said in ancient books that pearls grow in clouds, elephant tusks, fishes, snakes, and in oysters. Pearl should be purified before use.?
?
Coral?
Coral is the gem of Mars.?
Coral is prescribed for gaining money, relief from stomach disease, destruction of enemies, freedom from debt. Coral is formed in various colours, from white to crimson. In Ayurveda it is described as being sweetly sour (amla-madhura).? Coral gives strength and beauty.? It is specially prescribed for children to keep them in good health. It prevents children from crying in sleep and stops bleeding from nose.? White coral is prescribed for relief from menstrual pain and irregularities.? Dark and red coral is recommended for wearing to ward off evil effects caused by Mars.?
?
Emerald
Emerald is the precious stone for Mercury. It is recommended mainly for strengthening nervous system, recovery from schizophrenia and for gaining wealth, knowledge and benefits from trade and commerce.?
The colour of Emerald varies from pale Green to deep Green.?
Emerald being the gem of Mercury, it increases the stature of mathematicians. Writers, lawyers, orators, and businessmen. The deep Green Emerald is said to inhibit the sexual desire. Emerald makes one mentally and physically active. It helps cure ailments in the stomach and the brain. It also relives the pain caused by the sting of bees, wasps, hornets etc. Emerald both prevents and cure cholera. It is worn on the neck of children to ward off diseases.?

On (un)shielding movies and their critics
	
Adareyi Mang, which premiered last Friday at the Regal, is Prageeth Ratnayake?s first film. I first saw Prageeth as an actor, many, many years ago, and I should be forgiven for thinking that when he briefly left the screen for the stage, he left the industry for good. The movie (a love story) begins with a tribute to his acting guru, the incomparable yet tragically underutilised Dr Salamon Fonseka (?who taught me acting, directing and life,? the titles inform us), and while its plot isn?t something the art house director could have conjured up if Fonseka was his guru, it is entertaining, seems to be technically proficient and thankfully doesn?t bother to excessively focus on and praise its own workings (more on this in my review next week). This isn?t about Adareyi Mang only, though nor is it about Prageeth and Salamon Fonseka.??
To be sure, the film wasn?t profound in any conceivable sense. But I am tired of the notion that the movies, in this country, need to be profound. If we are put off by avant-garde directors, it?s not because we are less intelligent than them, but because we aren?t supposed to be intelligent in such a facile sense when we flock to the theatres. If the people want something and if that something isn?t predicated on serious themes, there?s no harm in delivering what they want. I think the critics are misconceived; consequently it?s not that we don?t want serious themes onscreen, it?s that we go to the halls less to intellectualise than to be entertained, and more to have something happen to us than think about what is happening to us. The rift shouldn?t be between art and entertainment; it should be between good and bad, with respect to whether a film entertains its audience even if they disagree with the ideology articulated in it.??
I?d rather have a good/bad binary playing out in our cinema this way as opposed to the art/entertainment dichotomy we?ve grown so used to. And why? Simply because the cinema, no matter how far the avant-gardists want it to go, hasn?t left behind its instinctive character. Movies play on our instincts, and once you let go of that and operate on the assumption that they no longer need to be felt, you let go of the only real principle that keeps the industry going.
That industry, here, is one year older than our independence; this year marks 70 years of the latter, 71 years of the former. Perhaps now?s the time to seriously look back and reflect on our history in the medium, and how critics have, whatever the epoch they were and are in, been shielded from all these fundamental truisms when it comes to their assessments of the medium.??
From 1947 to 1956, the conventional critical discourse in the film industry was that we should get out of the formulaic narrative; the narrative which copied and pandered to the Hindi and Tamil popular cinema. In those early days, as the authors of Profiling Sri Lankan Cinema aptly noted, popular audiences came largely from an consumerist and urbanised lifestyle, particularly the Sinhala-speaking bourgeoisie, and they thrived on the urban rich/village poor binaries that our first few directors churned out. These binaries, while derivative from the Indian melodrama, were also rooted in the Western cinema, which means that the leading critics at the time were against imitativeness on both counts; the leading voice at this juncture, of course, being Jayawilal Wilegoda. Wilegoda?s polemics against the Indian cinema proved to be successful when Lester James Peries made Rekava in 1956, but Lester was for him a Westernised filmmaker; he instead found the kind of movies he wanted in Sirisena Wimalaweera.??
But his nationalist voice largely disappeared from the popular press when Lester was at his peak, to be replaced by the politically committed, symbol hunting critic who wanted to go beyond Lester, shirking not just the Indian melodrama, but also the foundations of tradition that the man depicted and affirmed in film after film. Their hero was Dharmasena Pathiraja; at the premiere of his Ahas Gawwa, these critics distributed copies of a leaflet titled Appochchige Cinemawa, which reflected the young French critic?s distrust of the old masters of the medium in his country.
The French had a term for these masters and their movies: le cinema de papa. For their Sri Lankan counterparts, therefore, Lester was the papa who needed to be defied. In this era of political uncertainty, being a nationalist critical voice no longer made sense.??
From the first wave unleashed by Lester to the second wave unleashed by Pathiraja, we come to the third, unleashed by Prasanna Vithanage and Asoka Handagama, and the fourth, which we are still seeing through the likes of Vimukthi Jayasundera and Sanjeewa Pushpakumara. Around them there were and are other filmmakers, but they pander to popular audiences, which these artists don?t. It?s interesting to note here that none of those who unleashed these waves in our film industry retained popular support; what they unleashed did not and could not, receive the public in a spirit of camaraderie because what their films stood for was not what popular audiences clamoured after and for that matter idealised.
The critics who were with them were, inadvertently, pitted against such audiences, because of which the cinema dissolved into the art/entertainment binary we are witnessing today. The foundation of the industry appears to be nowhere today, a worrisome prospect because when an industry operates without a proper head or base, it tends to go confusingly haywire.?
To me, hence, the solution is as simple as it is obvious. In Sri Lanka, those who are considered as veterans to be reckoned within the field of criticism tend to privilege art house over popular entertainment. When there?s really nothing much to offer by way of such entertainment, and when all you have as entertainment is a self-referential figure (Ranjan Ramanayake, Vijaya Nandasiri, Bandu Samarasinghe, and Tennyson Cooray) performing the same antics and getting into the same mishaps, you can?t blame critics for ignoring their work. But to me, the worth of a film like Adareyi Mang lies in the fact that to ignore the likes of it altogether would be to shield audiences against what those aforementioned critics consider as bad and unwatchable.
What happens in the end, because of this, is that audiences are mollycoddled by the writers, and form assumptions of good and bad art based on the criterion of values the writers arbitrarily come up with. How?s the industry going to progress with that?? We need audiences to go watch Prageeth?s film, just as need them to go watch a film by Pushpakumara that happens to have won every conceivable award from European film festivals. So what?s the solution? Un-shielding the audiences, of course. How do you un-shield the audiences? By un-shielding the critics. And with them, the directors.?

Port City: President to declare reclaimed land as Lankan territory: Champika
	
President Maithripala Sirisena will declare the 269 hectares of reclaimed land at Port City as a territory of Sri Lanka in March after the necessary legal framework is passed in Parliament, Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka said yesterday.
Minister Ranawaka added that after declaring Port City a landmass constitutionally and legally belonging to Sri Lanka, it will be handed over to the National Housing Development Authority (NHDA) and in turn the NHDA will lease a part of the Port City to develop it as a Financial City to China Harbour Engineering Company Ltd. (CHECL) on a 99 year lease.
Addressing a news briefing at his office, Minister Ranawaka said the CHECL will launch a project in June to construct three high rises that contain 60 floors each at a cost of US$ 1 billion (Rs. 150 billion).
The special legal and administrative package that would govern financial, administrative, tax, rents and lease arrangements is being drafted by the Attorney General?s Department with the help of the Prime Minister?s office and the draft legislation will be presented to Parliament in April. As such, the Port City will not come under the purview of the Colombo Municipal Council, he said.
?Another US$ 800 is to be invested by CHECL to develop infrastructure at the Port City that will include a huge theme park for public use, an underground tunnel from Galle Face to Kollupitiya bordering the sea along the Marine Drive to ease traffic congestion on Galle Road, a light rail system from the Port City up to Katunayake are a part of the infrastructure development programme", Minister Ranawaka said.
He said organic soil made out of solid waste of Colombo will be used for land filling at the Port City and added Environment Impact Assessments (EIA) Feasibility Studies and tests for gavel, soil and pebble have also been done to ensure the strength of the ground and structures of Port City.
?The previous government had not done a single feasibility study or EIA relating to this major development project and therefore we had to start the project from a scratch,? Minister Ranawaka said. (Sandun A Jayasekera)

Prebiotics and probiotics, the dynamic duo
	
Turn on the television or radio at any time of the day and you will get to hear hundred and one advertisements relating to prebiotics and probiotics promising to make our lives healthier. How true is all this promotional information? Do they really have a scientific base?? ?
?
?Health Capsule today thought of doing a brainstorming session on Prebiotics and Probiotics and share with you latest information.? We are doing so because the next time you get to hear of a product connected to this health condition you would know to make a wise choice.? ?
?
?
Prebiotics-the facilitator
According to the Journal of Nutrition (March 2007), a prebiotic is defined as a ?selectively fermented ingredient, which allows specific changes in both the composition and activity in the gastrointestinal micro flora (human-friendly bacteria) that confers benefits upon host well-being and health?.
In simpler terms these substances stimulate the growth and activity of GOOD microorganisms in your gut, which are responsible in maintain a healthy digestive system.? ?
?
So, are there GOOD bacteria too? Yes, of course! They act as a protective barrier for the gut wall and carry out several other human-friendly functions, but won?t do any harm to you.? ?
?
The commonest dietary example is, non-digestible, fibrous compounds which pass through the esophagus, creating a nutrition-rich, warm and oxygen free environment for the healthy bacteria in the gut including bifido bacteria and lactobacilli. This thereby increases the resistance to other harmful organisms which attempt to invade the colon.? ?
?
Moreover, several research studies have demonstrated a remarkable beneficial effect of prebiotics on absorption of calcium and other minerals, maintenance of a strong immune system, reduction in bowel acidity and reduction of the risk of pathological conditions like hypertension, inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn?s disease and ulcerative colitis) and colorectal carcinoma.? ?
?
The commonest prebiotics, which occur naturally include,? ?
?Inulin? ?
	?Fructooligosaccharides? ?
	?Galactooligosaccharides? ?
	?Lactulose? ?
	?Lafinose? ?
?
Inulin is a soluble dietary fibre, which is known to be contained in over 36,000 different plants, but as the food industry and agriculture developed, the availability of these natural plants has become limited. Five-eighth servings of fruits and vegetables per day is the ideal amount of prebiotics required for an average individual.? ?
?
Leave aside all these ?tongue break-ably? complicated names,? look at the Pre-biotic rich food which you get to see every day like bananas, onions, garlic, leeks, asparagus, artichokes, soybeans and whole-wheat food and they top the list.? ?
?
However, in the modern world where the need for functional food has arisen, prebiotics are also added to everyday choices of food like cereals, biscuits, yoghurt, table spreads and bread which is what you get to hear and see on TV commercials on an hourly basis.? ?
?
Adding some plus points to this, even though the afore mentioned food items like asparagus, garlic, leeks, banana, wild yam and onions are known to be rich in prebiotics and prebiotic fibres, a person may need to consume a large quantity of these to fulfill the requirements of the body, in order to maintain a healthy gut flora and that is why people tend to choose prebiotic or symbiotic supplements (a combination of probiotic and prebiotic supplement) like Pre-biotin, which contains inulin and oligo-fructose, to ensure the required intake of these compounds.? ?
?
?
Probiotics-the good bacteria in our gut?
Probiotics are GOOD bacteria or live bacterial cultures which are similar to those, present naturally in your gut, carrying out favourable functions in order to maintain a healthy digestive system. These active cultures help in altering the population of human-friendly microbes in the gut flora and re-balance them in order to maintain the top-tier functional efficiency.?
?
They also help in boosting your immunity and help in reducing the susceptibility or even reducing the symptoms associated with diseases associated with the gut including Irritable Bowel Syndrome and lactose intolerance etc. They are also proven to be beneficial in reducing symptoms of allergies associated with specific exposures.? ?
?
The most popular Probiotics, we get to hear in our day to day lives include, yoghurt, pickles, Miso etc. You can also increase the naturally existing probiotics in your gut by feeding them properly. In fact, the intake of other essential nutrients, high fibre containing food, green leaves and vegetables will definitely facilitate the growth these gut-friendly probiotics in your gut.? ?
?
However, if all these activities aimed at reaching a sufficient amount of good bacteria fail, you can think of getting supplements which are available. They are user-friendly.? ?
?
Additionally, it is highly important to know that some of the activities you engage in can immensely contribute in destroying the population of this friendly gut flora in the body.?
?
They include:? ?
?The reckless prescription of antibiotics? ?
	?Sugar and sweetened food? ?
	?Tap water with chlorine and high concentrations  ? ? ? of minerals? ?
	?GMO foods (artificial flavours)? ?
	?Emotional stress? ?
	?Some chemicals you get exposed to? ?
	?Certain medications? ?
?
Bottom line
Prebiotics are like the breakfast, lunch and dinner for probiotics. If you feed your gut flora well, they will definitely do a great job in keeping your body healthy.? ?
?
You can find certain food containing both Prebiotics and Probiotics, which we call SYNBIOTICS. In fact, a dessert of yoghurt with chopped Banana would do miracles if you stick to a similar combo along with your daily meals.? ?
?
On a concluding note, Prebiotics and Probiotics which have numerous medically proven benefits, are a must in a healthy diet, where the requirement can either be fulfilled with diet or supplements-which is your choice to go with.? ?

Shooting incident in Kataragama: Villagers look for clues as police allegedly breach law
	
It is disheartening when the police who are supposed to ensure law and order in Sri Lankan society are consistently being levelled with accusations of violating such laws themselves. The shocking story in Kataragama, where Pathiranalage Niroshan died in a police shooting on January 20, made headlines. The deceased was a 25-year-old father of one. It added to the history of the Sri Lanka Police which is plagued with alleged misconducts and law-breaking incidents.? ?
According to recent reports, the Sri Lanka Police is to offer a house to the widow of Niroshan as ?compensation?. The question in the minds of many is whether it will cover up the shooting incident? First of all, did Niroshan have a criminal history behind him to justify the shooting? Was he trying to flee the area at the time of shooting? When probing the facts that this writer has gathered regarding the incident the answer is no. Is this incident the final result of an old argument or a fight the PC had with Niroshan or the pillion rider, the latter having a narrow escape? The answer again is no, according to Niroshan?s close family members and pillion rider Nuwan. The person who survived in the shooting incident, Nuwan, is in hospital. Is this an instance where the police officer missed his target? If an attempt made by a law enforcement officer to injure a ?suspect? results in the person shot at dying, it questions the policeman?s accuracy in shooting with with a weapon.??
?
A mother laments?
Sixty-three-year-old mother of Niroshan, S.A.Gunawathi, said the entire village of Nagahaweediya was shocked by hearing of the death of her son, whom she described as a person who was too helpful and kind to everyone.? ?
??Now they are going to give my daughter-in- law a house. My son had a dream of building a cement house for his family to live in. Giving them a house is good. But, she is helpless now. I am sure that all these politicians and bigwigs will not come once the funeral concludes. My daughter-in-law and our innocent kid need financial support. They were already struggling to meet their daily needs. However, any of these things will not be given back to me by my son. I hope the culprit will be given a heavier sentence because my beloved son died because of him. I asked the DIG to show the culprit to me. He somehow ignored my request.?? ?
?There was a dog that ate dozens of slippers belonged to my son and our family members. My son didn?t even hit the dog. He was too kind. When he went to the road, all the beggars knew him and greeted him because when he had money, he gave them. Beggars now tell me that my son used to buy them something to eat each time he met them. All of them cried,? recalled Niroshan?s mother.? ?
Widow demands death sentence for PC
?
Becoming a young widow can have a severe negative effect on a woman?s life. Twenty-two-year-old R.M.Chathurika got married to Niroshan in 2011. They had their first baby three and half years ago. Following the unfortunate death of Niroshan, Chathurika is in agony. She was even hospitalized after complaining of breathing difficulties. Her family members told the?Daily Mirror,? that she has hardly eaten anything after the death of her husband. Widowhood has created problems for Chathurika economically, socially and psychologically. She needs strength and courage to survive this difficult period.? ?
?Now, this home will never be filled with joy. It will never be the same. Niroshan left everything to me. He had no more time to spend with us,? she said.? ?
The 22-year-old lady lamented that the heartless shooting of her husband had snatched away her joy and also shattered the plans she had with her late husband.? ?
?He was shot at twice for what? Why did he deserve to die? He didn?t,? she complained.? ?
While narrating her ordeal to the Daily Mirror, the grieving widow said that her husband?s death had brought sorrow and pain to her and her family.? ?
?I feel the pain. I never thought our marriage would be this short. He was dreaming of building a house for us to live in. Everyone knows that he doesn?t harm anyone. No one can give my husband?s life back. Why did they kill him? I am pleading with the Government to ensure that the officer who killed my husband is prosecuted and handed a death sentence because my husband was neither a criminal nor a thug. The police officer who shot at my husband must not be allowed to go scot free. He has made me a widow when I am supposed to be enjoying my life with my husband and my son,? she said.? ?
Chathurika cried out to he President, Prime Minister and Minister of Law and Order, begging that the ?erring? officer who snatched away the life of her husband be given the maximum punishment and that any attempt to sweep the shooting under the carpet would mean denying her justice.? ?
??I also urge for an independent investigation to be conducted in a professional manner,? she added.? ?
?Taking away the innocent life of my husband deserves no light punishment, but the death sentence. I hope that the Police Constable gets a sentence that is worthy of his terrible act, which has cost my husband?s life. I don?t understand the law. I want the heaviest sentence for him which will make things even,? she continued.? ?
Between teardrops Chathurika, said, ?My son is just three-and- a-half years old now. He doesn?t even sleep at night without him. It is so hard to control him without Niroshan. He thinks his father is sick and sleeping. I don?t know how to respond to his queries hereafter. At the time my husband was shot at, he was bringing dinner for me. He had also planned to buy me a bicycle. He had wanted to surprise me with that gift. It was only after he had died that his friends told me about it. This is just too devastating for us and we want justice,? she demanded.? ?
?No one can rely on the police to protect them. They are too faraway to save lives. The police aren?t going to offer us salvation,? she remarked.??
?
Pillion rider recalls shooting incident?
?
Nuwan Buddhika is the only eyewitness to the shooting incident. He was the pillion rider. Nuwan and Niroshan were best buddies and their friendship began during childhood. Nuwan, who had a narrow escape in the shooting incident, was also injured when the motorcycle fell on one of his legs. He is currently being treated at Kataragama Divisional Hospital. He spoke to the?Daily Mirror,?on several matters relating to the shooting incident.
Incident?
?It was around 10 and 10.30 pm on Saturday (January 20) night. We were on our way back home from a party. While we were reaching Wedihiti Kanda Junction, we saw a torchlight being directed from the side of the road towards us. My friend Niroshan pulled over the motorcycle a few meters away from where torch light was directed. Then, I started getting down from the motorbike. I heard two gunshots. The first shot missed its target. But, the second hit the rear of my friend?s head. We both fell on the road. A man at the fruit shop on the opposite side of the road came and assisted in taking Niroshan to hospital. He had already succumbed to his injuries when he was brought to hospital,? reminisced Nuwan.? ?
Shooting for no obvious reason? ?
?Niroshan was hanging on my shirtsleeve and trying to say something. The police constable and the civil defence officer approached us and slapped me when I asked why they opened fire at us without any reason. The police constable used his leg to take off Niroshan?s helmet. They shot at us as if we were wanted criminals who were fleeing from police. We were wearing helmets. Niroshan had his driving license. There was no obvious reason for them to stop us and shoot us in that inhumane manner. How can they shoot a rider in the head, for not stopping the bike right at the exact place the rider was asked to stop? What should we expect from the police now? Instead of ensuring our safety, they do the opposite. The two officers were not even on the road. I observed that the light from the torch was coming from inside a bush. How can we possibly stop our motorcycle at that time without clearly identifying who was behind the bush? ? Nuwan queried.? ?
Dramatic escape? ?
?He was my best friend. He was killed right in front of my eyes. No one will understand how devastating and hard it is to see ones childhood best friend exhale his last breath in front of his best buddy. I would have been killed if I didn?t get down from the bike. It was so dramatic how I was not hit by a bullet. I had a narrow escape from death. Niroshan had a lot of dreams to fulfill. His kid started nursery just a week ago. He was planning to buy a bike for his wife to take the kid to the nursery. He talked with me about the gift when we were having lunch that day. Now, his small family is left desperate and helpless,? Niroshan?s best friend added.? ?
People outraged? ?
?We never had any kind of arguments or fights either with the PC or the Civil Defense Officer. Niroshan and I met them randomly. There was no reason for this incident to be a revenge attack. Especially my friend Niroshan didn?t even harm an animal. This entire village knows how kind he was. We are both members of the cleaning staff attached to the Divisional Secretariat?s Office. Niroshan was known as someone who didn?t even use abusive words. He had won many hearts in Kataragama. That is why the entire village initiated a string of protests on hearing the shooting,? added Nuwan.? ?
Misreporting by media? ?
?We observed that the media had reported that Niroshan was aged 44. He was born in 1993 and was 25 at the time of death. Media reports also said that the police had opened fire at a speeding motorcycle. What actually happened there was completely different. He pulled over the bike and one of his legs was already off the pedal when I was getting down. The bias manner in which much of the media reported the shooting is very unfair and unethical. Media personnel should visit Kataragama, listen to us and update themselves on the real story without writing about it from air conditioned offices in Colombo,? said Nuwan.
?
?
?Under The Penal Code it?s a murder?
Former Human Rights Commissioner Prathiba Mahanamahewa said? that according to the provisions made by the Penal Code, the shooting? amounts to a murder.? ?
?The Police cannot shoot and kill a motorcyclist even if he failed to stop at a police barrier after being given instructions to? apprehend. Therefore it?s a blunt violation of fundamental rights and? criminal law. Police must make a reasonable effort to stop and arrest? him for a charge or reasonable suspicion against him. This must be done? by using the necessary force by following the motorcyclist using their? powerful motor bicycles or by obtaining the registered number of the? motorcycle from the RMV and file criminal action.? ?
?This incident violates the Supreme Law of the country and? other criminal Laws. This shooting incident violates Article 11 of the? 1978 Constitution relating to freedom from inhuman torture and degrading? punishment. This is the utmost important fundamental right to life that? even the 1978 constitution of Sri Lanka doesn?t guarantee. The Supreme? Court had delivered a judgment where the person died under police? custody as a result of arbitrary arrest and torture in the police? station in the case of Sriyani De Silva Vs OIC Payagala 2003. This? incident also violates the Criminal Procedure Code as the method of? arrest exceeds the necessary power specified for such a task. Under The? Penal Code it?s a murder. The Police have been trained with scientific? methods which must be used when arresting a person according to the? criminal procedure. First, words must be used by the Police to get him? to surrender. In the event these words are ignored and the person tries? to escape the police can use a similar power to get the person to? surrender. If the suspect is escaping from police custody and is firing? back at the police officers using a weapon then the police can shoot at? the suspect below the knee to make him surrender.???
?
"After the shooting incident, while he was a live, the police? had failed to take him to the nearest hospital for treatment. This is a? violation of a person?s right to health"
?After the shooting incident, while he was a live, the police? had failed to take him to the nearest hospital for treatment. This is a? violation of a person?s right to health. The person who accompanied the? deceased had given evidence that his friend was alive for some time? before dying. During this situation there is also the failure to carry? out a duty by the police officer as a Government servant in Sri Lanka.? In the case of dispersing some unruly demonstrators the police must use? tear gas first and then baton charge them followed by the use of a water cannon. Therefore police cannot fire live bullets if the suspect is? unarmed. If the suspect is firing back at the police then the latter? must take action in self-defense. Finally this could also be the? violation of the police ordinance if a senior officer had given? instructions to carry out this order which becomes illegal.?? ?
?
Protesting villagers beaten-up? ?
?A group of police constables dragged me out of the bus and started beating me???
?
P.K. Seelawathi is a co-worker of Niroshan at the Kataragama Divisional Secretariat?s Office. Niroshan is also a distant relative of Seelawathi. She was among the arrested villagers who took part in the protest. Seelwathi, who is currently being treated at Kataragama Divisional Hospital, told the?Daily Mirror,? that she along with many other women who participated in the protest were severely beaten- up by the police.? ?
?It was only after reporting to work at the Divisional Secretariat?s office on 21st morning that I came to know that Niroshan was shot dead by the police. I was shocked by the news. Later on, all the villagers got together around 9 am and walked towards the Kataragama Police Station. We were demanding from the Police to show us the two murderers. Our people were so outraged that they were screaming in front of the police station against the ridiculous and illegal act carried out by the police. By afternoon, the riot police started firing tear gas at us. Some youth threw stones at the police station and damaged some property. That is when the riot police and other police officers started attacking us and arresting almost all of us.? ?
?I couldn?t run that far to escape the police. What I did was hide inside a bus, parked in the neighbourhood. A police constable reached me and repeatedly hit me on my head with a baton. A few minutes later, a group of police constables noticed me and dragged me out of the bus. Then they started beating me up. My entire body is now swollen and aching. Later, we were taken to the police station. During the protest, we were asking the police what right they had to kill people. On the other hand, how could the male police officers harass and beat us in this manner? There had been no problems between the Kataragama police and the villagers earlier. The protests erupted only because every one of us loved this son who maintained a good character. He didn?t deserve to die,? said Seelavathi.? ?
?
?The kid?s future shouldn?t be destroyed ?
?
Kandasami Dammika is also being treated at the same hospital for body aches after being in the thick of things during the unrest.? ?
?We took into the streets because they killed one of our sons. However, the police officers attacked us without mercy. Niroshan is not a relative of mine. Let?s assume that the protesters did a wrong thing by trying to take the law into their hands. Even for that offence, the Sri Lankan law has made provisions only for arrests to be made. The law doesn?t allow protesters to be attacked. I think the shooting incident and the manner in which the police behaved during the protest are black marks in the history of Sri Lanka Police. Last but not least, we demand justice for the killing. The desperate wife of Niroshan needs help now. The kid?s future should not be destroyed as a result of the incident,? said Dhammika.? ?
?
?
?
?The police didn?t bother to listen to me?? ?
Another person who the?Daily Mirror,? interviewed was Chamith Attanayake who said that he was on his way to the filling station and had no involvement in the protest. While he was watching proceedings from outside, he was beaten up by the police assuming he too was a protester. He is also undergoing treatment at the hospital.? ?
?I am not a close friend of Niroshan. I didn?t participate in the protest. I was on my way to the filling station to buy oil for my grass-cutting machine. That was when I noticed that a protest was in process. I was watching the proceedings. A group of youths ran towards me. The Police was chasing them. I also had to run with them because I saw a dozen of police officers coming towards where I was. I thought they would assume that I too as a protester and beat me up. Eventually I was caught by five police officers. I tried to tell them that I was not involved. I asked them to take me to the police station without beating me up. I also asked them to check the CCTV videos or whatever the videos they had, in order to clarify whether I was involved in the protest. But the police didn?t bother to listen to me,? said Attanayake.

SL Army urges not to tarnish its image
	
Disgruntled elements were attempting to spread fabricated stories about the Sri Lanka Army with malicious intent, Sri Lanka Army Headquarters said in a media release today.
?It has been observed that certain elements with malicious and hidden agendas are currently engaged in criticizing the Si Lanka Army with the motive of demoralizing and misleading soldiers and tarnishing its image,? it
?In the recent past, some disgruntled elements have been attempting to spread or publish unfounded and fabricated stories in media with regard to incidents like foreign allowances, rations, payments for disabled War Heroes of the Sri Lanka Army," the media release said
?It is also regretful to note that some politically-manipulated elements with vested
Interests are found to be behind the regularly organized street protests by disabled War Heroes or members of their families, although their issues have been resolved to a large extent with 100% increase in their pension and disabled payments,? it stated.
It further said the Sri Lanka Army had fully committed to the national security and nation- building roles as the most sought after service provider with strict focus on concerns of reconciliation and development.
The SLA appealed to all segments of society to keep the Army off from their machinations and all acts of intentional vilification and public ridicule for the greater benefit of the country. (Sheain Fernandopulle)

SL tell 15,447 Lankan illegals in Kuwait to use amnesty period
	
While stating that the government of Kuwait has declared an amnesty period for illegal expatriates in Kuwait, the Embassy of Sri Lanka in Kuwait said about 15,447 Sri Lankans were illegally living in Kuwait.
The Embassy said in a statement that the Ministry of Interior of Kuwait has declared an amnesty period from January 29 to February 22 for expatriates who do not possess residency permits or those with expired residency permits, to rectify their status or leave the country.
It said the amnesty would allow illegal residents to leave the country during the amnesty period through any port without paying penalties; or to legalize their status and continue residing in Kuwait after paying all fines and obtaining a valid visa without being referred to the investigation department.
?Those who leave the country during this amnesty will be allowed to enter Kuwait again if they meet the regular conditions of entry and if they were not banned from entry for another reason. However, residency violators who are banned from travelling or subjected to court cases should visit the Residency Affairs Department to discuss the possibility of getting a valid visa during the amnesty period, the decree stated,? it said.
It said if an illegal resident was caught during the amnesty period, such a person would be deported immediately. It also said residency violators who do not leave the country during the amnesty period would have to face legal penalties, denial of valid visa, deportation and denial of re-entry into Kuwait.
?This is a rare opportunity for about 15,447 Sri Lankans who live illegally in Kuwait to resolve their residency issues or leave the country without being blacklisted,? it said.
It said further inquiries could be made in this regard from the Embassy via its hotline: 00 965 65000118. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)

Tamil Nadu govt. urges Modi to oppose Lankan bill for fishermen
	
Tamil Nadu chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami on Thursday urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to direct the External Affairs Ministry and the Indian Mission in Sri Lanka to register a strong protest against the island nation's new legislation aimed at imposing huge penalties on the Indian fishermen entering its water.
DMK and Tamil Nadu Congress Committee also sought the Centre's intervention to protect Indian fishermen from Tamil Nadu and Puducherry.
In a letter to Modi, Palaniswami said that a new bill named the Foreign Fishing Vessels Bill has been introduced in the Lankan Parliament on Wednesday with provisions to incarcerate "our fishermen for longer periods of time and impose huge penalties, which run up to few crores of Indian rupees."
The new bill enables the Lankan government to slap hefty fines ranging from Sri Lankan rupee 50 lakh to 17.5 crore (ranging from Rs 20 lakh-Rs 7 crore) on Tamil Nadu fishermen, depending on the size of the fishing boats.
Pointing out that the move has created widespread resentment and panic, he said that the livelihood of fishermen from Tamil Nadu who fish in the waters of Palk Bay would then be left at the mercy of the Lankan government.
"It is an extremely unfortunate development, at the time when the ministers of India and Sri Lanka met twice and the Joint Working Group on Fisheries met thrice, to work out a permanent solution to resolve this long pending sensitive livelihood issue," Palaniswami wrote. (DNA)

Unseen aspects of  sexual disorders
	
?
? Jeewani starts her life with Sasanka harbouring millions of hopes to spend a happy life together. Despite many proposals Jeewani choses Sasanka because of his simplicity and kindness. However their marriage starts to show cracks due to frictions between them. Jeewani holds a higher executive post in a renowned company. Sasanka starts suspecting Jeewani of having relationships with other men.
?
He then starts consuming alcohol which further aggravates the problem. When the attractive Jeewani goes out well-dressed, Sasanka is very unhappy. One day Jeewani returns home late after a meeting. Sasanka keeps questioning Jeewani about her other relationships. This leads to an argument and finally Sasanka lands a blow and Jeewani?s head bangs on a wall. The report by Forensic psychiatrists reveals that Sasanka has been suffering from Erectile Dysfunction and this led him to experience delusions of infidelity (suspecting the fidelity of spouse beyond reasons).?? ?
?
Human Sexuality? ?
Human sexuality is a common topic being discussed in the society at present. Human sexuality denotes sexual feelings and related expressions regarding human relationships. The real sexual intercourse between man and woman is only one part of human sexuality. From a biological point of view this leads to the conception of a baby and allows the genes to be progressed over generations. In the Sri Lankan cultural setup marriage fulfills some important aspects related to human sexuality. At the same time sexuality and sexual intercourse increases the bond between husband and wife. Sexual intercourse is one mode where a couple can express love, care and strengthen bond. It is evident that relaxing hormones are being secreted after climax in sexual inter-course, like ? Endorphins? and ? Enkephalins? hence sex acts as a mode which relieves anxiety. However to fulfill all these one has to have a healthy sex life.? ?
?
Common sexual disorders? ?
When considering sexual disorders common among males, erectile dysfunction is the commonest . Here the male is unable to maintains his erection until sexual intercourse is satisfactory; till both male and female reach climax. In premature ejaculation, the male reaches climax and ejaculates early without the female reaching climax. Lack or loss of sexual desire is also a disorder present in males.? ?
When it comes to the sexual disorders of females vaginismus, dyspareunia and loss of sexual desire is common. In vaginismus the smooth muscles around vagina go into spasm (contracted)so there is a difficulty inserting the penis through vagina. In dyspareunia there is pain during sexual intercourse. At the same time lack of sexual desire is also common in females.? ?
There is an entity called ?Nymphomani? in which females have excessive sexual desire and ?Satyriasis? where males have high sexual desire.? ?
?
What are the reasons behind sexual disorders?? ?
?There are physical and psychological causes leading to sexual disorders. There is a misconception among the general public that most of the causes of sexual disorders are physical. However most of the causes are psychological than physical.? ?
Smoking, excessive alcohol use, other drug use, physical illnesses like diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol and other disorders related to nervous system may contribute to the physical causes of sexual disorders. At the same time certain medication used to treat illnesses can cause sexual dysfunction.? ?
Stress is a major factor leading to sexual dysfunction. The stress arising from marital conflicts are leading causes. However work stress, stress arising through matters related to children may also lead to sexual dysfunction. When it comes to the psychiatric causes of sexual dysfunction, depression, anxiety disorders, alcohol dependency are the main. At the same time psychotic disorders and other mood disorders can also lead to sexual dysfunction. However without any physical or psychological cause one can experience sexual dysfunction.? ?
Are sexual preference deviations, homosexuality and gender identity issues, psychiatric illnesses ?? ?
Heterosexual sexual contacts are said to be ? Normal? mode of sexual contact. Here the predominant way of arousal and gratifying sexual need is male having a sexual contact with a female or vice versa. ?Homosexuality? is not considered as a psychiatric illness. In sexual preference deviation disorders the predominant mode of sexual arousal is other than a heterosexual partner. In ?pedophilia? the predominant mode of sexual arousal and gratification is children which can cause detrimental effects to the affected child, family as well as the society. In ?voyeurism? the main mode of arousal is seeing other people having sex, in ?sadism? the partner inflicts pain on the other to get aroused. In ?exhibitionism? people tend to show their genitalia to others, especially publicly. In ?fetichism? the person concerned needs an object related to the opposite partner to get sexual arousal. The commonly used items are under garments.?
Because of social stigma these people tend to wander around during night to collect undergarments which leads to massively detrimental psychosocial issues.These are considered as psychiatry disorders which need treatment.? ?
In ?transsexualism? a person tends to think and play the role meant for the opposite sex. For an example a biological male who likes to live as a female and a biological female who likes to live as a male are considered as being transexuals. This is categorised in classification systems of the psychiatric disorders. However the positive point here is that the person who is having transsexualism can utilise health services and resources when they are identified as transsexuals.? ?
?
Good sexual health??
Even though there are no sexual disorders, there are factors that lead to good sexual health. A balanced diet, good physical health, maintaining a healthy weight according to your height, exercises, refraining from consuming excessive alcohol and avoiding smoking are recommended. At the same time better communication with the partner and freedom during sexual contact are also important factors. One very common reason for non satisfactory sexual encounters is the lack of awareness regarding the sexual organs and the process. Therefore it is very important to be educated on the sexual organs and the process.? ?
?
Can they be treated?
It is apparent from the research studies that most patients with sexual disorders come for treatment very late. This is due to the misconception about sexual disorders and the related stigma associated with this condition. More than that the lack of awareness regarding sexuality, sexual intercourse and sexual disorders are the main reasons.?
Therefore there is a tendency for people to seek alternative treatments as well as obtain medication without the proper recommendation of a qualified doctor. What should be stressed here is ?taking over the counter medications? can even lead to death. There are pharmacological treatments (using medications) as well as psychological treatments (psychotherapy) for sexual disorders. However it is utmost important that one should get proper advise from a qualified psychiatrist before starting treatment. This can prevent many detrimental effects and help get over illnesses without complications.? ?
?
A message for you!? ?
Sexuality and good sexual health are important factors for every human. Sexual disorders are common. However it is very rarely that these patients? receive the attention of doctors. Sexual disorders can pop up in the society in many forms. Be careful when taking treatment because in the absence of proper advise, from a qualified psychiatrist, the patient can be led to death.? ?
Talk about your sexual problems openly. Seek treatment early. There may be many Jeewanis and Sasankas in society. If you are aware of the these illnesses and come for treatment, how many valuable lives would you save?? ?
Note : Please note that all the names are hypothetical?
