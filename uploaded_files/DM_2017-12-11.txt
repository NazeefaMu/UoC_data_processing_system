Asked about possible unity between the two factions, Mr. Rajapaksa who spearheads Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) said there should be an opposition to the government. He said there were people disappointed with the government over the bond scam, the rising cost of living and the curtailment of subsidies and over nationalist sentiments.
We should have a political force to accept them. What will happen to these people if we align with a government group he asked.(Kelum Bandara)

Elvis latest Christmas CD out
	
Elvis and Prescilla Presley

The Elvis Presley Fan Club of Sri Lanka has sent us news of Elvis latest Christmas CD, with orchestration by the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, the third such philharmonic-backed album.
Club President Jayaratne Perera has included a quote by Prescilla Presley, taken from the accompanying booklet. She says:
It was snowing in Bad Nauheim, Germany, this particular night I was with Elvis. We were sitting in the sitting room at the house he rented while serving in the US army stationed in Germany. He got up from his chair, took my hand and led me to the window. He said in a sentimental tone, Look at all that snow, it reminds me of Christmas at Graceland. Of all the holidays, its my favourite time of the year. We would have family members, friends to celebrate. The tree would be in the living room loaded with gifts. I have a Santa and Reindeer decoration scene out in front so everyone that drove by Graceland could see it from the highway. For next year, I want to have more colourful lights out front to make it even more festive. I want you to come visit me at Graceland sometime and see for yourself how beautiful it is.
Standing next to him at that moment I could have never guessed that these words would come true years later. But there I was, experiencing every word he described of what Christmas was like.

Foreign experts to fight bribes, corruption
	
The Government was mulling obtaining the assistance of external experts to carry out investigations on corruption, Minister of Law and Order Sagala Ratnayake said over the weekend.
He said that the assistance of external experts might be needed to carry out investigations on corruption.
There are areas where our investigators lack expertise, and they have to seek the assistance of outside parties  sometimes foreign experts, the Minister said.
Minister was speaking at the Anti Corruption Day celebrations on Saturday.
There are challenges that we need to overcome. I am aware that the patience of the public  especially the ones who have voted for the Government against bribery and corruption  is wearing thin. They want to see the culprits convicted and they, understandably, demand justice without delay. Our law enforcement bodies are working day in and day out, despite many a challenge, to achieve these results and fulfil the expectations of those who voted for a change on January 08, 2015," he said
It is important to understand that some of the major financial crimes under probe were meticulously planned and carefully executed. It requires a lot of time and hard work to trace evidence analyse them and bring the perpetrators to book, he added.
There are areas where our investigators lack expertise, and they have to seek the assistance of outside parties  sometimes foreign experts. Also, there are areas where the investigators are hampered by lack of resources and human capital. We, as a Government, continuously work with the law enforcement parties to address these issues and find sustainable solutions. Amid all these issues, the Police have produced satisfactory results," the Minister stated.
The Police Financial Crimes Investigation Division has so far received 370 cases of which 73 have been forwarded to other bodies for investigations. The FCID has so far concluded 93 investigations and sent to the Attorney Generals Departments advice for legal action. The Criminal Investigations Department has conducted 38 investigations  24 on cases involving people and 14 on cases involving properties  of which 17 cases have been referred to the Attorney Generals Department for legal advice, the Minister said.
"We are aware that the Attorney Generals Department too is facing issues on the human capital front. This is not a blame game and we all have to understand the challenges each party faces, and help find permanent solutions. The Government has also taken measures to recruit more state counsels to the Attorney Generals Department to expedite legal action, he added.
To further facilitate this process, the United National Partys Working Committee has already passed three separate resolutions for the expedition of action regarding cases involving bribery, corruption and financial crimes.
The party has also resolved that measures should be taken for the appointment of Trial at Bars at High Courts to hear such cases and the appointment of a special prosecution authority under the Attorney General. In addition, the party has resolved that legal provisions should be made available enabling anyone to appeal to the Supreme Court directly against the rulings by the High Court," he said.
"Currently, such appeals are made to the Court of Appeal. When these new mechanisms are in place, we believe, prosecutions with regard to cases of bribery and corruption will move fast. Our governments commitment to this cause was clearly shown when Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe made a voluntary statement to the Presidential Commission of Inquiry into the Treasury Bonds issue.
It was the first time a Prime Minister of Sri Lanka offered to engage with an ongoing investigation. We have seen many instances where political power was used to clamp down investigators and block proceedings, he also said. (Yohan Perera)

Husband hospitalized when the wife tried to show off her skills
	
A person was hospitalized for allergy caused by the application of some hair-dye by his wife when she tried to show off her skills as a beauty culturerist.
She was a mother of two children. She had been interested in beauty culture. That is the reason why she followed a beauty culture course. With the passage of time, she learnt how to blacken the white hair as well with the understanding that it would be beneficial to her and her husband in future.
On a Sunday, when she and her husband were watching television, she suggested her husband to bring some hair dye, to be applied on his hair. He hurried in his a motor cycle and brought a hair dye packet . Then, his wife applied it on his hair. However, when his wife began to start the hair care, she began to scream at the top of her voice when her husbands neck and ear area began to irritate with a burning sensation.
Their neighbor who rushed to the scene advised her to send her husband to the hospital. The doctors, who diagnosed the disease, came to the conclusion that the dye used for hair had become allergic. (Viyaluwa correspondent)

Speaker Karu Jayasuriya said today he had informed MP Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe that he did not agree with the matters raised by the MP on the constitutionality of the Constitutional Assembly.
The MP who was removed from his portfolio a couple of months ago, had written to the Speaker requesting him to abolish the Constitutional Assembly and take steps to rectify the error he claims to have been made by Parliament to postpone the provincial council elections regardless of the Supreme Court ruling.
In his letter, Mr. Rajapakshe said the decision to appoint a constitutional assembly on March 9, 2016 was unlawful on the basis that the people had not given a mandate to set up a constitutional assembly because no party had secured a majority at the 2015 general elections.
The traditional concept adopted by the whole world is that pledges given by a political party at an election does not hold true when that party has not secured a majority in the legislature," he said in the letter.
The Speaker said he conveyed his stance to Mr. Rajapakshe.
House Leader Lakshman Kiriella said Mr.Rajapakshe should have made a statement in the House without sending letters to the Speaker. One should not write love letters to the Speaker," he said in lighter vein. (Yohan Perera and Ajith Siriwardana)

Shashi Kapoor and Johnny Hallyday:  Two megastars in different worlds
	
Johnny Hallyday

Shashi Kapoor, one of Bollywoods best-loved stars and easily the one best known internationally from that era, has died at age 79. He died in Mumbai on Monday after a prolonged
kidney ailment.
Kapoor stood out from a formidable galaxy of big-name stars in the 70s and 80s  his brothers Raj and Shammi, Dilip Kumar, Rajendra Kumar, Rajesh Khanna, Amitabh Bhachchan and Vinod Khanna  with his sophisticated, suave manner and charm. He was blessed enough to hail from the celebrated Indian film-making dynasty of Prithviraj Kapoor.
But he was never content to pose on this golden pedestal and worked hard. His first leading role was in the award-winning 1961 film Dharmputra, directed by Yash Chopra, which dealt with the painful theme of partition.
This was followed by a number of hits in the 1970s, including Kabhi Kabhie (1976) and Thrishna (1979). In both, his co-star was Bollywood giant Amitabh Bhachchan.
He married his English actress-wife Jennifer Kapoor (nee Kendal) in 1958. His fluent English made him a good choice for the English-language films of Merchant Ivory set in India. He and his wife starred in Bombay Talkie (1970) and the 1982 Merchant Ivory classic Heat and Dust, based on Ruth Prawyer Jhabwalas novel about a romance between an Indian prince and an Englishwoman. In 1972, he was chosen by Conrad Rooks for the film version of Herman Hesses novel Siddhartha, in which Kapoor gives a nuanced performance as an intellectually troubled young man in search of wisdom and the meaning of life.
After Jennifer died in the mid-1980s from cancer, Kapoor acted much less but appeared in such films as In Custody by Ismail Merchant in 1993, and he acted with Claire Bloom in the 1987 film Sammy and Rosie Get Laid. In all, Sashi Kapoor acted in more than 100 films.

"This was followed by a number of hits in the 1970s, including Kabhi Kabhie (1976) and Thrishna (1979). In both, his co-star was Bollywood giant Amitabh Bhachchan"
Johnny Hallyday
Johnny Hallyday, Frances biggest rock star for more than 50 years, has died at age 74.
Born Jean-Philippe Smet in Paris, Hallyday was raised by an aunt after his Belgian parents separated. He borrowed the name Hallyday from his nieces American husband Lee Halliday, misspelling it in the process.
He was better known outside France for his movie performances, including Westerns. As a singer, he was little known internationally but was sensationally successful in France, with more than 1000 songs, and selling more than 110 million records. His last free concert in 2009 was attended by almost one million fans.
Despite his success, Hallyday said his tragedy was to be born in France. The sentimental French chanson and American-inspired rock are worlds apart. As he put it: French lyrics are too unwieldy for rock. Our words are too long. You just cant sing rock and roll in French Im only an interpreter. Ive only ever written a few songs in my life, and I needed a lot of cocaine to do that. But I can put across to an audience some of my feelings. I cannot live any other way.
Shashi Kapoor

He was being honest. More than a fourth of his recordings were French adaptations of English-language songs, and he faithfully copied almost every major rock star from the 1960s on, from Elvis Presley to the Rolling Stones, Jimi Hendrix to Bon Jovi and Prince. But his French fans loved it. His records went gold 40 times and platinum 22 times in France. Though he was politically conservative (a friend of presidents Jacques Chirac and Nicolas Sarkoszy), he cut across social and political barriers easily, appealing equally to farmers, workers and left-wing intellectuals, who called him the French Mayakovsky.

"Hallyday lived a rock celebritys life to the hilt, marrying four times. His first wife was pop singer Sylvie Vartan, his last Laeticia Boudou, a model"
Hallyday lived a rock celebritys life to the hilt, marrying four times. His first wife was pop singer Sylvie Vartan, his last Laeticia Boudou, a model. In between, he had a son with actress Nathalie Baye and was featured in more Paris Match covers than any other Frenchman. A keen motorcyclist, he loved riding Harley Davidsons through American deserts and highways.
His breakthrough role in films came in 1985 when Goddard cast him in his classic The Detective and he won an award in 2003 for his role in Patrice Lecontes  LHomme du Train. In 1963, he acted in the Western From Where Do you Come, Johnny with Sylvie Vartan. His temperament and physique made him a natural for action films. In the 1988 film Triangle of Fire, he acts as a
French mercenary.

She is the JO's only female MP, who spoke at the very first JO rally held at Nugegoda soon after the 2015 election. She is a great asset to the JO. Journalists ask why she left. Actually, she was compelled to leave, PHU leader MP Udaya Gammanpila told a news conference.
He said she had attended the Ampara nomination committee meeting on more than six days but some leaders failed to attend these committee meetings though repeatedly requested.
The last meeting was held on Saturday where she told party leaders that she cant go to the village without solving these issues. However, Im not saying Ms. Wijewickramas demands are reasonable and should be granted. She should have been given an opportunity to talk about these demands, but didnt get the opportunity, Mr. Gammanpila said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

## Title: True role of an investment advisor
## Section: Financial News
## Date: 11 December 2017 10:30 am
True role of an investment advisor
	
Many investment advisors are eager to give you advice when investing in thestock market.
The article will identify how you could choose one that best suits your needs. This article will hopefully help investors distinguish between frivolous claims and claims with merit. Investment advisors dont have a crystal ball and they are not guarantors of investments. But they do have duties and responsibilities. Investors, from their part, should know what those obligations are before they invest.
Fair dealing
An investment advisor (hereinafter referred to as advisor) has a fundamental responsibility for fair dealing. The securities industry requires an investment advisor to treat his customer in a fair and honest manner. He shall observe high standards of commercial honor, just and equitable principles of trade. It is the standard on which investors are supposed to depend.
Duty of loyalty
An advisor makes his money through commission. Thus an inherent conflict can exist between the advisors interests and those of the customers. But the advisor must always place the interests of the customer first. The duty to the customer must be paramount. For instance, trading frequently can become an issue. The advisor should only recommend trades when they meet the needs of the consumer, not merely to generate commission. Excessive trading by an advisor for the sake of increasing commission is known as churning and itis illegal.
Disclosure
An advisor also has a duty to disclose all material information related to an investment recommendation Also, an advisor has an obligation to disclose the various risks on an investment recommendation. Advisors must be truthful in all communications with investors. Essentially, their communications should provide a sound basis for evaluating any recommended securities. Exaggerated, false or misleading statements are flatly prohibited.
Trading authorizations
Advisors may not perform activities in a customers account unless the customer has approved and authorized the trade in advance by signing a Discretionary Account. Even in such situations advisors are expected to act with caution.
Suitable recommendations
Investment recommendations should be consistent with the customers financial status, investment objectives, level of understanding and risk tolerance. Under the suitability rule and the know your customer rule, an advisor must reasonably believe that the recommendation is appropriate for that particular customer based upon his specific financial situation, understanding and needs. The advisor should create an up-to-date customer profile that matches the customer with the appropriate investment.
An advanced advisor will focus on the following when rendering recommendations to his clients.

Asset allocation
The phrase asset allocation means how the overall portfolio is distributed among asset classes such as stocks, bonds, and money market instruments. In Sri Lanka, investment advisors deal with equity and corporate debentures while fund managers handle other forms of asset classes. Asset allocation sounds simple  until you realize that this one decision can account for 91.5% of your investment returns over time.
To select the proper asset allocation, the advisor should look at the clients investment time horizon and goals. As time goes by the advisor is expected to adjust asset allocation as the clients needs and themarkets change.

Return & risk analysis
The least understood part of investing is often the relationship between risk and return  and how to position a portfolio on that spectrum. An investment advisor should help clients determine their risk tolerance and assist them in selecting the stocks that suit their needs. Understanding investment risk is the first step in beginning to manage it wisely!
Special situations
Of course, some investments are riskier than others and may therefore require additional duties of the advisor. For example, trading with money borrowed from the stock brokering firm( trading on margin) is a carefully regulated activity.
Stay in contact with clients
The clients situation may change. Things change and with it the risk level of the client changes. If a client just had a child the situation needs to be reassessed, the client now has more obligations and expenses and the risk level may have to be reduced. Therefore the advisor has a fiduciary duty to stay in touch with his client to ensure that investments are still suitable. If an advisor has not at least contacted his clients by phone in the last 3 or 4 months it is best to talk
to them.

Investors place their total faith in their investment advisor. Usually their (investors) financial affairs are in good hands and there is nothing to worry about. However smart investors will be mindful when interacting with their investment advisors


Role of the stock brokering firm
Many customers follow the advice of their advisor based upon the reputation of the stock brokering firm. Both the stock brokering firm and advisor should act in good faith with customers. Customers automatically trust and rely upon the stock broker firm to operate under the high standards imposed upon the
securities profession.
Soft skills
Advisors also need certain soft skills and personal characteristics to succeed in this occupation. Here are the most important ones:
Active listening: He must be able to listen and understand the clients financial goals.
Critical thinking: To figure out how to help the client meet his goals, he needs to evaluate all the
available data.
Reading/ Comprehension: It is necessary to understand documents that describe various
financial instruments.
Verbal communication: Must be able to clearly explain the financial services provided to
potential clients.
Service orientation: A desire to help people plan for the future
is important.

Ven. Ajahn Sumedho Dhamma sermon on December 12 in Kaduwela
	
Having followed some of his sermons on Lord Buddhas teachings on YouTube I believe, it would be of help to all to comprehend the complexities of Dhamma
December 12 at 6.30 p.m. at the Bodhignana Meditation Monastery in Kaduwela

Ajahn Sumedho will be visiting Sri Lanka and shall deliver a Dhamma sermon on the December 12 at 6.30 p.m. at the Bodhignana Meditation Monastery in Kaduwela.
The writer was most interested in knowing about this erudite monk, who is well versed in the dhamma and a great exponent of intuitive meditation.
Having followed some of his sermons on Lord Buddhas teachings on YouTube I believe, would be of help to all to comprehend the complexities of Dhamma.
Ven. Ajahn Sumedho very succinctly interprets Vipassana as waking to reality rather than trying to achieve refined Consciousness through concentrating on external mind-objects or imagery.
His explanation that reality is formless being in the present here and now will enable to identify intangible thoughts such as happiness, anger, anxiety, jealousy, fear, sorrow brought by sensory perceptions when irritated or impinged upon results in suffering as you do not live in the present it goes unnoticed.

As you cannot escape the reality to accept it, ut to examine the origin of such thoughts resulting from grasping and clinging gives much needed impetus to a beginner to understand the dhamma.

Withdraw gazette declared railways as essential service: JO
	
Joint opposition MP Dinesh Gunawardane today urged the government to withdraw the gazette notification issued by President Maithripala Sirisena declaring the railways as an essential service claiming it would aggravate the issue.
The MP said the attempt to suppress trade union action would only rebound on the government as a reflection on its failure to resolve this contentious issue rather than a victory.
He said if the rights of trade unions were suppressed and if any trade union was forcibly dissolved, other trade unions too may join in the struggle to ensure their rights. (Ajith Siriwardana and Yohan Perera)
