A costly pastime
	
?
Kolonnawa was the area that was most affected when the Kelani River in its lower reaches overflowed this time round.?
?
A study has revealed that one of the main factors that led to thousands of houses going under water within a matter of few hours was the construction of numerous structures on land-fills on the river bank. The authorities who were taking a count of such illegal structures had come upon a large fish tank built by obstructing a major canal meant to drain out flood waters into the Kelani River.?
Upon this discovery, people in the area had made inquiries to find out as to who was so powerful as to obstruct an important waterway by building a fish tank across it. It had transpired later that a leading businessman had built the tank at the cost of several millions of rupees for his pastime of fish watching.?
It had also come to light that this mighty businessman was the one who had been hand-picked for the job of putting up cutouts and political bill boards across the country during the previous regime.

Car wars: Yes we want'em
	
Three Ministers today justified the Government's move to seek Parliament approval to purchase luxury vehicles to various State and Cabinet Ministers and said Ministers need super luxury vehicles to travel to their electorate, various functions and ceremonies round the country.
Joint Cabinet Spokesmen Ministers Dr. Rajitha Senaratne and Gayantha Karunatileka and Deputy Minister Karunaratne Paranawithana answering a barrage of questions from journalists, who repeatedly asked Ministers the merit of allocating Government MPs to import SUVs such Land Cruisers, Outlanders, Hummers and super luxury cars like Mercedes Benz, BMW, Volvo, Jaguar and Audi, that cost between Rs. 50 million to Rs. 90 million each, they said the Government members needed those vehicles to attend to their work and travel thousands of kilometers round the country.
Media personnel questioned as to why the Government allocated this kind of money to import new vehicles for Government Ministers, while asking the public to tighten their belts to face an economic down-turn and to pay back a huge amount of foreign loans, obtained by the Rajapaksa regime.
The journalists collectively asked whether this was not a case of ?Making Hay While the Sun Shines? and charged that the Government has increased the tax on vehicles to increase the vehicle prices, while putting another burden on the already suffering people through VAT increase.
?Though the Government promised relief to purchase a family car to a middle class family, it is now beyond the reach of them and only a super rich can afford to buy a new or reconditioned vehicle,? the journalists lamented.
Trying to explain the Government?s position, Minister Senaratne said Ministers and Deputy Ministers needed super luxury vehicles to travel to their electorate, various functions and ceremonies round the country.
?Do not forget that politicians in other countries draw five to ten times of salaries drawn by Sri Lanka politicians. Politicians use low engine capacity vehicles in countries like Singapore and Maldives because they need not travel much far. In Sri Lanka we have to travel hundreds of kilometers and we need a comfortable vehicle for that,? he stressed.
Minister Karunaratne said some Ministries had not purchased vehicles for 20 years and politicians would have to repay the loan granted to them to purchase vehicles under a Value Depreciation Formula (VDF) and after five years they could own the vehicle.
The Government on Tuesday sought Parliamentary approval for a supplementary estimate to cover Rs. 1.1 billion for the purchase of vehicles to various Cabinet and State Ministers. (Sandun A Jayasekera)

Indian joint venture for Trinco oil tanks
	
The Government, at yesterdays Cabinet meeting, had decided to handle the operation of the Trincomalee Upper Tank Farm as a joint venture between Lanka Indian Oil Company (LIOC) and the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) in pursuance of an announcement made during Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's to Sri Lanka in 2015.
The joint venture will help develop 30 tanks of the Upper Tank Farm.
Initially, the then UNP Government signed an agreement to hand over the Trincomalee Oil Tank Farm to LIOC for 35 years. However, the Prime Minister, in his note to the Cabinet, has reportedly, said that no such agreement had materialised up to now. However, the LIOC had used 14 tanks of the Lower Tank Farm since then.
The Upper Tank Farm consists of 84 tanks. In the note submitted to the Cabinet, it was observed that these tanks remain abandoned as of now. When Mr. Modi visited Sri Lanka, an announcement was made to form a Joint Task Force.
Against this backdrop, the Cabinet approved a paper on May 24, 2015. It was presented by Subject Minister Chandima Weerakkody. In this document he had sought to hand over the title and ownership of 16 tanks to the CPC. Yet, the government of India was not in favour of this Cabinet decision.
The latest Cabinet decision taken yesterday rescinds previous decisions with the proposal for a Joint Venture between the CPC and the LIOC to operate 30 tanks. (Kelum Bandara)

JO slams Govt. over vehicle allocation
	
The Joint Opposition today slammed the Government for seeking to spend Rs. 1.1 billion to purchase vehicles to 30 Cabinet and State Ministers.
Addressing a news conference, former Minister G.L. Peiris said the Government had mixed up its priorities by placing the privileges of the Ministers first instead of looking after the common man.
?The Government should have spent the funds to uplift the livelihood of recent flood victims and the displaced residents of Kosgama. Members of the Government are making the hay, while the sun shines. Some Ministers already have more than one vehicle,? he said.
While reiterating that the Government was not a national government but a United National Party (UNP) Government, he requested the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) Ministers and MPs of the Government to vote for the No-Confidence motion against Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake
He said if the SLFP decided to vote against the motion, it would indicate that they were backing Government policies, which had resulted in an economic crisis in the country.
?People are suffering from high cost of living due to heavy taxation. These are the results of UNP?s financial principles. Therefore, we request the SLFP to vote in support of the no-confidence motion against Minister Karunanayake. If they vote against it, they will be no longer able to say that they are against Government policies, which are suppressing the common man,? he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Kingpin of Illegal kidney racket arrested
	
The alleged kingpin of the kidney racket busted at Delhi?s Apollo Hospital was arrested from Kolkata on Tuesday.
A woman from Siliguri in West Bengal and a married couple from UP were also nabbed on Tuesday, taking the total number of arrests in the case to nine.
The mastermind, T Rajkumar Rao, 39, was held in a joint operation of Kolkata Police and Delhi Police and is likely to be brought to the Capital by Wednesday night or Thursday morning.
Rao was under the radar of Delhi Police and a team was camping in Kolkata for the last two-three days. Rao was reportedly arrested from a party that he had organised.
He was introduced to the organ racket by a woman named Shama and her aide Deepaankar in Kolkata eight to nine years ago. Police are also looking for them.
Rao?s name surfaced in the latest racket during the interrogation of his three accomplices ? Aseem Sikdar, Devashish Moulik and Satya Prakash.
The others arrested on Tuesday are Umesh Shrivastava and his wife Neelu, natives of Kanpur in Uttar Pradesh, and Momita Mauli from Siliguri.
All three of them are donors whose kidneys were illegally donated to different recipients allegedly at the hospital by five members of the racket who were arrested on Friday, said police.

Momita is the wife of one of the middlemen already arrested, Devashish Mauli. Police officers said they were verifying the names and backgrounds of the arrested people as they suspect the donors used fake names.
A quarrel between Momita and Devashish over payment of money promised to her against the kidney she had donated on her husband?s direction came to the notice of Sarita Vihar police and helped them bust the racket.
Momita?s kidney was donated to a patient from Jammu and Kashmir less than a fortnight before the racket was busted, said police. Momita had called the 100 number after the tiff with her husband.
Investigators are looking for two more donors and raids are being conducted in Kanpur, Kolkata, Nagpur, Jalandhar, Coimbatore and other cities to nab them.
Police sources said the racket is spread across many cities. ?We are looking for the five recipients who got kidneys of the five donors,? said a senior police officer. (Hindustan Times)

Lenovo is set to reveal next-gen VR/AR hardware: here's what we know so far
	
Lenovo looks like it's set to debut new virtual reality hardware in a year already full of VR surprises, and it's doing it with the help of a chipmaker named Movidius.
A few days in advance of Lenovo's Tech World event June 9 in San Francisco, chipmaker Movidius has announced via press release that its hardware will be inside a series of AR (augmented reality) and VR (virtual reality) products made by Lenovo. The first product in this partnership will debut in the second half of 2016. According to Movidius, this is a dedicated mobile VR device that's not a phone at all.
I've tried to reach out to Lenovo but haven't received further details, yet. But I was able to speak to Movidius. The chip being used from Movidius -- the Myriad 2 -- is optimized for computer vision. The DJI Phantom 4 drone uses it. It's the sort of processor that could be used for positional tracking in a mobile headset.
Imagine a mobile VR device that could track where you're moving and know where you're walking, letting you walk in VR all the time without using the kind of external sensors or light-emitting boxes the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive use. This type of positional tracking isn't available yet on Samsung Gear VR and doesn't seem to be part of Google's first-wave plans for its Daydream, but Microsoft's HoloLens and the Meta 2 mixed-reality headsets can position-track. In theory, this could be what Lenovo is working on with Movidius for both virtual reality and augmented reality, where the real world mixes with the virtual.
This device isn't the Google Tango-powered phone that Lenovo has also been working on. That phone uses a Google-developed depth-sensing camera array to map out 3D space and measure distances between objects to create on-phone augmented reality. It's not even clear what software platform it might run.
Movidius CEO, Remi El-Ouazzane, says "Our technology was built to maximize machine vision performance in a sub-1 Watt power budget. In selecting Myriad 2 for their VR products, Lenovo is building devices designed from the ground-up for VR. We're very much looking forward to these no-compromise devices that will push VR adoption into the mainstream."
Movidius' press release also includes a quote from Lenovo's Shanghai Research & Technology group Manager, Li Xiang. "Lenovo has a long tradition of bringing innovative products to the market. Myriad 2 is unique in its ability to deliver the kind of vision compute performance we need for our next generation VR products. We can build the products we want, without compromising on cost, size, performance or battery life."
Lenovo Tech World will be the debut of the first piece of VR hardware that's part of this multi-device partnership, but other products are planned. Maybe they're headsets, maybe they're cameras. Maybe they're something else. Lenovo Tech World is known to debut weird and wild tech concepts; last year, Lenovo teased dual-display smartwatches and smart shoes with screens. We'll follow up with more details as soon as we know them.

Litro Gas open tender raises eyebrows
	
Best practices of government tender procedures have come into question over the recent open tender by state-owned Litro Gas for the supply of 250,000 metric tonnes of LP gas, Daily Mirror learns.
According to informed sources, the flouting of the tender procedures was largely aimed at favouring one of the bidders, a company of Singaporean origin, which had allegedly not fulfilled the tender requirements within the stipulated time frame.
For this Litro Gas tender scheduled to close at 3.00 p.m. on May 27, 2016, each selected bidder was asked to submit a bid bond of US$1 million along with the tender documents.
The submission of the bid bond amounting to US$1 million by 3.00 p.m. was specifically mentioned in the Litro Gas tender advertisement which appeared in a weekend English newspaper on April 24, 2016.
However, on the day of the opening of the bond, a Litro Gas tender board official had verbally announced that bid bonds amounting to US$1 million could be submitted till 4.30 p.m. leading to the assumption that it was the cut off time for the submission of bid bonds.
However, sources said despite the extended deadline, the Singaporean company in question, along with two other bidders, appeared not to have submitted bid bonds even by 4.30 p.m. on May 27, and the Litro Gas official had reportedly taken a personal interest in the said company submitting a bid bond along with the tender documents.
Interestingly, it was revealed that only this particular official had access to inspect the bid bonds submitted by the bidders despite there being several officials from Litro Gas and a representative from the Public Enterprise Development Ministry on the tender board.
According to general rules pertaining to tenders, if a bidder fails to provide all the required documents and financial commitments within the stipulated time period of the tender, their bid is deemed disqualified.
Sources said in case the Singaporean company had submitted a bid bond after the stipulated time it should therefore be disqualified.
They said the tender worthiness of such a bid bond, if there was any could be determined by checking the issue date and time of the bid bond with the issuer bank.
Meanwhile, in spite of the said tender being an open tender, Litro Gas tender board has declined to declare the price quotations of the each tenderer at the opening of the tenders.
Litro Gas tender board had reportedly told the tenderers that it was not company policy to declare prices and the bidders would be notified of the prices only once the tender was awarded, a promise made during a tender in 2015 too, but never honoured.
Thus, the move denied the opportunity for participating bidders to be aware of the lowest offer and thereby keeping provisions to introduce amended prices to tender documents.
The tender participants pointed out that even at the opening of the Defence Ministry tenders, which are obviously more sensitive in nature than LP gas, the prices are declared at the opening of the tenders.
However, despite the total suppression of information from their side, Litro Gas had reportedly insisted on each bidding party to disclose who their foreign principal was.
Meanwhile, the bidders charged that any proof of submission of bid bonds was not physically shown to bidders, who were entitled to know who had bid and who were the bidders going into the next round of evaluation.
A representative of one of the tender participants expressed his apprehension over the developments and said a Cabinet appointed tender board should evaluate the tenders to ensure transparency, given their scale and importance.
Attempts to reach Litro Gas Chairman Shalila Munasinghe or CEO Muditha Pieris to obtain a comment regarding the matter were not successful.

No civilians affected by chemicals during war: PM
	
There had been no reports to suggest that chemical emission from the weapons used during the war time, had got into the bodies of civilians, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe informed Parliament today.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe who was responding to a question raised by TNA MP Sivashakthi Anandan said there had been no evidence to suggest, such a phenomenon had taken place.
"It is common knowledge that civilians had suffered, especially during the final stages of the war, as a result of artillery fire and other weapons used by both sides, but there is no evidence to suggest that chemical emissions from any weapons entering into human bodies,? the Prime Minister said.
However, he said the Government would provide medical assistance if there were any civilians, who were contaminated with chemicals that came out of weapons.
?We will send such civilians abroad for treatment, if such persons are found,? he added.
The Prime Minister requested the MP to provide information on such persons.(Yohan Perera)

NZ?s McCullum apologizes to Murali and Sanga
	
Former New Zealand captain Brendon McCullumon Monday apologized to former Sri Lanka?s bowling star MuttiahMuralitharan for running him out during a match in 2006 in Christchurch, NewZealand.
Delivering the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) Spirit of Cricket lecture at Lord's in London McCullum saidnow he views things very differently and would hope that he is a very different person.
?I became incredibly competitive; winning was everything and I didn't really care what it took to win,? he said.
?I now look back on that part of my game with regret. There are many things I would change if I could. I guess growing up in a cricketing sense is no different to growing up in life, except that it's a much more public rite of passage where everything you do is scrutinised,?
?There's no escaping some of the things I've done. It's on video - posterity in the worst possible way,?
?You probably want an example and fair enough too. Much as it pains me to talk about it publicly, I'll tell you how I ran out Muttiah Muralitharan,?
?We were playing Sri Lanka at Lancaster Park in Christchurch in late 2006. Kumar Sangakkara scored a magnificent 100 in the second innings. When Kumar reached his 100, Sri Lanka were nine down - the ball was still in the air being returned to me as wicketkeeper when Murali left his ground to congratulate Kumar. When the ball arrived in my gloves, I removed the bails and appealed. Murali was given out and we went on to win the match,?
?Not surprisingly, the incident created controversy and bad feelings. The Sri Lankans were stunned. Their captain MahelaJayawardene said at the time: ?Legally it was run out, the ball was alive, but we play in an age where we talk about the spirit of the game. Hopefully it won't happen again. It's not the way to play cricket,?
?If I could turn back time, I would. We were within the laws of the game but not the spirit and there is a very important difference which is glaringly obvious to me years later, and it's that aspect that I want to focus on a little more this evening,"
?Because nearly ten years after running out Murali, I view things very differently and I would hope that I am a very different person. Kumar Sangakkara is here tonight. Sanga, I admire you enormously. I regard you as a friend. And I take this opportunity to apologise to you and Murali for my actions on that day," he added.

The Government should intervene to protect the lives of Basnayaka Nilames as they faced death threats trying to protect the temporalities of the Devalas, the Basnayake Nilames said today.
President of their association Mahanuwara Sri Kataragama Devala Basnayaka Nilame Gemunu Bandara Walisundara said hundreds of acres of lands, belonging to the Devalas, had been encroached forcibly by politicians, their accomplices and underworld gangs.
?We, as Basnayaka Nilames, maintain the Devalas and conduct Pujas with the income of the temporalities of the Devalas. We do not receive any funds from the Government. Today we have no income to do them, as the properties have been seized illegally. When we go to collect rents, they threaten us with death. How can we protect these Devalas without this rent monies?,? Walisundara asked.
He said the Police had not provided any security to them and added that the Police took months to investigate, whenever they lodged a complaint.
?It is the responsibility of the Government to ensure our security. But we have no security. The Government provides security to unwanted people, but pays no attention to us who face death threats,? he said.
Mr. Walisundara alleged that certain groups were attempting to discredit the position of the Basnayaka Nilames. (Nadeeka Daya Bandara)

What he is to lose is as precious as what he is to gain
	
?
This politico having too many irons in the fire lost at the last general polls, but was fortunate enough to get a seat in the council through the gratis list. Later he was elevated to a high post carrying deputy status.?
?
He is now wearing another hat -- as the chair of a body looking after a popular game.?
Recently he had received an invitation from two Green stalwarts to re-join their ranks saying that it would be a cake walk to Diyawanna if he entered the fray next time from their party. He also had been given the assurance that he would be raised to the top table status as an immediate reward.?
However, the politico has found it difficult to make up his mind as the elevation to the top table would mean losing him his lordship over the popular game.

Woes of a top bureaucrat
	
?
A head of an institution responsible for raking in much revenue for the exchequer recently met a second rung political authority of the Ministry that directly supervises his institution at the Ministry premises itself. ?Being old friends, they had a heart-to-heart after small talk. ?The white collar bigwig who was in a highly depressed state of mind, decided to pour out his troubles to the political authority. ??Sir, you know that I functioned as the head of a number of departments,? he began. ?Yes, I know what is your present problem?? the political authority queried.
?
?It?s not a case of having one single problem,? replied the white collar one. ?I am confronted with an array of problems? What I am going to confide in you is something I haven?t even told my wife? If I am to carry out instructions coming from this Ministry any further, I may end up in Welikada sooner or later!?
The white collar one continued: ?I get no order in writing. Some woman of dubious status would call me and ask me to do this and that and she would warn me that I may have to do my accounting to those above if I fail to comply. Believe me, Sir. All the orders I get through this woman are highly irregular??
The political authority who was playing only a second fiddle knowing ?that he was utterly helpless in the matter expressed his sympathies to the white collar friend.
