Asylum seeker on Nauru jailed after attemping suicide
	
Refugee advocates are concerned for a Sri Lankan asylum seeker on Nauru who has been jailed after he attempted to commit suicide at the detention centre there.
The Tamil Refugee Council, based in Australia, says the 30-year-old man climbed up a tree and remained there for nine hours on Sunday, threatening to jump.
Its spokesperson, Aran Mylvaganam, says the man's refugee application was rejected recently, after being in detention for two and a half years.
Mr Mylvaganam says detention centre workers told the man he and his family would receive help if he came down, but when he did, the police arrested him.
"The police came and arrested him and according to the information we are getting from the refugees inside the centre he is in jail but we don't know the reasons why the police have arrested him. It may be illegal for someone to attempt suicide in Nauru, that may be the case." (Radio New Zealand)

Bandula raps withdrawal tax
	
	UPFA MP Bandula Gunawardane today criticised the budget proposal to impose charges on cash withdrawals by bank customers. The government through the 2016 budget has proposed to impose charges on cash withdrawals which exceed Rs. 1 million.
	Accordingly, a 2 percent of a charge would be acquired by the government when a customer withdraws cash between Rs. 1 million to 10 million.
	Those who are withdrawing cash amounts exceeding Rs. 10 million would be liable for a 3 percent of a charge from their funds.
	Discouraging cash transportation in line with security considerations was the reason for the proposal, Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake said in his budget speech.
	MP Gunawardane said the proposal was absurd as it was discouraging people to save in banks.
	People cant withdraw their own money without giving a ransom to the government. If someone withdraws Rs. 1 million, they wont be able to get the total amount. They will have to pay Rs. 20,000 to the government. When withdrawing more than Rs. 1 million, a person will have to give Rs. 200,000, he said.
	He said this proposal was one of the many budget proposals which had deceived the people. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Bar surprised over HC Judges charge
	
The Bar Association of Sri Lanka (BASL) the pioneering body comprising all lawyers in the country expressed its surprise over the incident where the Galle High Court Judge had filed a case against former Solicitor General and Presidents Counsel Rienzie Arsecularatne after his phone started ringing inside the court house.
Bar head, Geoffrey Alegaratnam PC told the Daily Mirror, that it was unusual and surprising the way how the senior criminal lawyer had been charged. It is a very surprising order on the part of the High Court judge. We are considering this incident in details and contemplating on the incident, Mr Alegaratnam the head of the unofficial bar said.
We have a certain courtesy between the bar and the judicial officers. This is not a deliberate act on the part of Mr. Arsacularatne and he had not done it intentionally to insult court, the head of the Bar stated. He said it was a mistake and had happened accidentally.
The principles of justice should be looked at in a humane manner,
However Mr. Alegaratnam said it had happened as a result of a judicial order and the Bar was considering about the incident in detail.
Meanwhile senior criminal lawyer Mr. Arsecularatne said he did not plead guilty to the charge and he had informed the BASL, the recognized professional body for lawyers about the incident.
I did not do it deliberately and as soon as I realized that it was my phone I switched it off, Mr. Arsecularatne said. He said that similar incidents take place accidentally even in the Supreme Court where the chief Justice presides over and also in the Appeal Court but Justices would treat such incident in a humane manner.

Bribery case: Counsel wants Npita Police OIC arrested
	
Bribery Commission officials today told the Magistrate they were awaiting the Commission's advice on arresting the Narahenpita Police OIC when the Crimes OIC's lawyer told Court that the OIC should also be arrested.
Narahenpita Police Crimes Branch OIC Don Tissa Siri Suagathapala was earlier arrested by Bribery officers on charges of having accepted a bribe of Rs.2.5 million from a suspect, to avoid taking legal action against him in a forgery case, was re-remanded by Colombo Additional Magistrate Nirosha Fernando.
Counsel Gunaratne Wanninayake who appeared for OIC Sugathapala said his client was not involved in this incident and was only following the Narahenpita Police OIC's instruction to collect the money from the suspect, Shantha Loku Bandara.
Counsel said the Narahenpita Police OICs name was mentioned in the first complaint made to the Bribery Commission with regard to the soliciting of a bribe of Rs.8 million from Mr. Bandara.
According to the complaint the Police OIC had instructed the Crimes Branch OIC to collect the first installment of Rs.2.5 million by contacting the suspect and as such the Bribery Commission should arrest the Narahenpita OIC as well.
The Bribery Commission officers said they were continuing with the investigations and awaiting the BC advice on arresting the OIC. The case was postponed for December 7. (Shehan Chamika Silva)

President tells developed nations to be thoughtful
	
	While claiming that as a developing country and a tropical island nation, Sri Lanka is highly exposed to the impact of climate change, President Maithripala Sirisena emphasized the need to have deep cuts in global greenhouse gas emissions by developed countries considering the historical responsibility.
	He said everyone needed to embrace the principle of common but different responsibilities and respective capabilities in order to keep the temperature increase below two degrees Celsius in this century.
	Addressing the United Nations Conference on Climate Change  2015, in Paris, France yesterday he further said "even though our per capita emission was low and insignificant in the global sense, we had contributed and will contribute to global mitigation efforts".
	On the domestic front, I am glad to declare that Sri Lanka has launched several Climate Smart Initiatives, the President added.
	The President also said that changes in temperature, rainfall variation and sea level rise would directly impact almost all sectors of our economy, including agriculture, fisheries, livestock, water, biodiversity, health, human settlements, tourism and transport.
	Occurrences of natural disasters due to extreme weather conditions such as droughts, floods and landslides frequently deprive lives and livelihoods of the people in Sri Lanka. We consider that the transfer of technology to developing countries will ensure that people will be able to address the need of adaptation and nationally suitable mitigation actions.
	Even though our per capita emission is low and Insignificant in the global sense, we have contributed and will contribute to global mitigation efforts. On the domestic front, I am glad to declare that Sri Lanka has launched several Climate Smart Initiatives.
	As a Buddhist I strongly believe that Gautama Buddha was the greatest environmentalist who was born to this world. Lord Buddha was the first visionary to speak about the concept of sustainable development, the President said.

PHU condemns SIU probe on alleged fraud
	
The Pivithuru Hela Urumaya today condemned the manner in which the Police Special Investigation Unit (SIU) was investigating the fraud alleged to have been committed by PHU General Secretary Udaya Gammanpila.
It said two SIU officers had been sent to Australia, the country of residence of businessman Brian Chaddick, to carry out their investigations into the fraud. Mr. Chaddick had earlier alleged that he had been deprived of assets and interest worth Rs.110 million because of a fraud committed by Mr. Gammanpila.
When officials of the Presidential Commission of Inquiry to Investigate and Inquire into Serious Acts of Fraud, Corruption and Abuse of Power, State Resources, and Privileges (PRECIFAC) visited ex-president Mahinda Rajapaksa's residence in Mirihana to record a statement on a matter concerning the ITN TV station, the so-called Yahapalanaya governments supporters were disappointed and condemned the move.
How can the government then justify the decision to send SIU officers to another country to obtain a statement with regard to an investigation into a matter linked to Mr. Gammanpila These all are well planned moves to take revenge on him. I am certain that these actions are being carried out under the guidance of a particular Cabinet Minister who is imagining he can destroy Mr. Gammanpilas political career, PHU Media Secretary Thushara Dissanayake said.

Special Excise Unit robs Rs.2.5mn from suspect
	
	Controversy surrounds a shocking incident relating to the Colombo Excise Department where members of its special branch had allegedly assaulted and threatened a businessman in Mannar at gunpoint and robbed his cash amounting to Rs.2.5 million, informed sources disclosed.
	Six members attached to the special unit, which is known as the Special Branch or the Intelligence Unit that directly operates under the purview of the Departments Deputy Commissioner Crimes, had arrested a businessman in Mannar on November 21 during a special raid.
	The Excise team in civvies led by the Officer-in-Charge of the special unit armed with pistols had obstructed the businessmans car at an undisclosed location on the Mannar  Anuradhapura main Road.
	The businessman identified as Dushmantha and his driver Pradeep were taken into custody for the alleged possession and transportation of Kerala Ganja
	(a strong variety of Cannabis usually smuggled from South India).
	The sleuths however could not find any narcotics in the traders possession but only found a bundle of currency notes amounting to Rs.2.5 million in the car.
	When the sleuths had failed to find any narcotics in the vehicle, they had taken the duo to a remote area and brutally assaulted them and threatened with death at gunpoint before relieving them of their money, sources said.
	The sleuths were however careful not to disclose their identity as to which law enforcement agency they belonged to.
	The businessman who was in a serious condition had got himself admitted to the Dambulla Hospital and had reportedly made a full statement to the Hospital Police Post that an armed gang had robbed his money after assaulting them.
	The Excise unit retrieving back to Colombo had rushed to the Dambulla Hospital after hearing that the businessmans condition was serious than they thought.
	The sleuths had returned half of the robbed money to the owner immediately and tried to cool him off by promising the rest soon and forced him to discharge from the hospital.
	According to sources, the unit is currently engaged with two infamous characters in Gampaha called Osmond and Denim Shantha to compromise a settlement with the agitated businessman without going for legal action.
	The incident had also been brought to the attention of Excise Commissioner General L K G Gunawardena but the outcome was not immediately known. Attempts to get a comment from the Excise Commissioner were not successful. (Kevin Kariyawasam)

Will not compromise national security: President
	
President Maithripala Sirisena assured that he would not take any decision under any circumstances that would compromise the national security when he met the Sri Lankan community in France today.
President Sirisena said he was able to restore the prestige and dignity of Sri Lanka in the global arena after a period of negative and hostile attitude towards Sri Lanka by the international community.
The extremely positive approach by the international community was clearly manifested during his cordial and friendly discussions with a number of world leaders during the just concluded CHOGM in Malta, he said.
British Prime Minister David Cameron, Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, were among the world leaders who met President Sirisena during the CHOGM.
President Sirisena expressed his gratitude to expatriate Sri Lankans living in France for their contribution to nation building and said he expected to meet all expatriate Sri Lankans living abroad in future.
He said he loved Sri Lanka as much as or even more than any other Sri Lankan and vowed that he would never compromise national security under any circumstances. He said this at a meeting with the members of the Sri Lankan community in France at the Embassy of Sri Lanka in Paris on November 29.
The representatives of the Sri Lankan community asked about allegations that some actions of the government could adversely affect the national security and the President replied that he was totally committed to the safety, security and integrity of Sri Lanka and he would never allow anybody to take any action that could be affect the national sovereignty or security.
He pointed out that his government was installed only 10 months ago and detailed out the major achievements such as adoption of 19th Amendment to the Constitution, establishment of the Constitution Council, appointment of various Commissions including Judiciary Commission, Elections Commission, Police Commission and Public Service Commission.
He urged the diaspora representatives to extend all possible help to Sri Lanka for the development activities of the government. (Sandun A Jayasekera)
