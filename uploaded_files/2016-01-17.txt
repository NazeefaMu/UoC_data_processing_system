NFF to contest LG polls from a new front
	
The National Freedom Front (NFF) headed by MP Wimal Weerawansa will be contesting the upcoming local government elections from a newly formed political front.
Speaking at a media briefing, its leader Wimal Weerawansa said winning the LG polls would be their first step towards their goal of ?toppling the government.?
He said the country was moving towards anarchy due to the manner in which the government was behaving.
?We can observe that the Maithri-Ranil coalition is dragging our country along an uncertain track where peace and its unitary status are not protected. This was made clear by the speech delivered by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe during the Thai-Pongal National Ceremony held in Jaffna, in the presence of former president Chandrika Kumaratunga. He had said that he would work to abolish the Prevention of Terrorism Act in the coming months. This can be a huge threat to national security,? he said.
Mr. Weerawansa alleged that the prime minister?s move to abolish the PTA (Prevention of Terrorism Act) was a result of a promise made by the government to the Human Rights Commissioner in Geneva, adding that the country had become a puppet of what he called ?international influences'.
Meanwhile, he stressed that before bringing in an Act of Parliament to control of the activities of Buddhist monks, the government should seek the approval of the Tri Nikayas? Sanga Nayaka Theros. (Piyumi Fonseka)

Rajitha ready to meet GMOA in Court
	
Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne today said he was ready to face the Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) in Court if they decided to sue him over the Malabe Private Medical University.
The GMOA on Friday said that it would take legal action against Minister Senaratne and Ministry Secretary Anura Jayawickrama for permitting the Private Medical University students to perform clinical training at government hospitals.
Minister Senaratne said the decision to allow the university's students to train at State hospitals was taken following Court order and that it was not a decision of him or ministry's secretary.
"We carried out a order given by the Court and there's nothing the GMOA or others can do about it. They attempted to involve in the case as a third party but it was rejected by the Court. If they want to take the matter into Court, let them do it. I'm ready to face them," he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Sri Lanka cannot be divided: PM
	
In a special statement on the process of drafting a new Constitution, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said today the country could not be divided and that no one had the slightest intention of diluting the unitary nature of the country through the new Constitution.
He said the new Constitution was being drafted within the parameters of the Sixth Amendment to the 1983 Constitution which prohibits the setting up of a separate state within the territory of Sri Lanka.
?Some say the foremost place given to Buddhism and the unitary nature of the country are being diluted through the new constitution. No one wants to divide the country. Most of us including me are Buddhists, I am Sinhalese and I need to unite the whole country. The draft will be passed with a two-thirds majority in Parliament. For those who speak of Buddhism losing its foremost place in the Constitution, I will make a special statement in Parliament. I ask the small parties not to politicize this issue,? the Prime Minister said. ?The new constitution will be based on the aspirations of the people.?
He said the names of those in the committee to collect the views and proposals of the people via social media had been submitted by him to Cabinet on December 19, 2015.
The Prime Minister said the 24-member committee would also travel across the country to collect the views and proposals of the people.
?I am not keen to draft the new constitution inside a single chamber. I want the people to present their views to draft a Constitution which is suitable for the 21st century. The purpose of using the social media is to obtain the views of the youth who will be the future leaders of this country. This is the first time that the social media is being harnessed in drafting a new Constitution,? he said.
After the draft Constitution is passed with a two-thirds majority, it will be submitted to the Cabinet and then placed before the people at a referendum, he added. (Piyumi Fonseka)
