ACT FASTER: GMOA SHOULD NOT BE PERMITTED TO OVERSTEP ITS BOUNDARIES
	
Picture shows dejected patients are made to further suffering at hospitals due to GMOAs trade union action
It is my strong belief that my motherland is a paradise lost owing to poor statecraft. Erasmus, a Theologian, (c. 1466  1536) had endorsed that people should at all costs avoid belligerent nationalism, denounce war as the greatest of evils and distrusted kings. Erasmus had been concerned that for the liberties of the people, he had favoured a government in which people would be in control. 
English humanist Thomas More had produced the most outstanding work of political thought - UTOPIA, a Greek word meaning nowhere, in Latin in 1516. He had also outlined that a Nation could be improved, liberated and strengthened if we respect and observe the ideals of humanism, concerns for education and devotion to public welfare. More had emphasised on the need to have sympathy with the plight of the poor and had argued that the governments should provide employment/work so that no man would be driven to theft by the pressure of want etc. They had argued citizens should not be made destitute  lacking means of subsistence, lacking food, clothing and shelter. 
Both had emphasized good rulers should obey the law and that God punishes the tyrant, the ruler who is cruel and oppressive. They had also believed that bad rulers were sent by God to punish the peoples sins. They had however contended that kings owed their position to recognition by the people, and that they must be punished if they abuse their power, even though they were considered as gods lieutenants. It had also been believed that the kings were the lowest of the three levels in human society, the other two being the people and the priesthood, both of whom kings are instituted to serve. Accordingly, they had opined that the people should rebel against the king, their servant, if they act irresponsibly in immoral manner and had propounded the doctrine of government by the consent of the people. They had also endorsed that a government could be overthrown if it did not serve the ends for which it had been instituted and particularly if it hindered the people in the attainment of their salvation. It was therefore considered lawful to resist a tyrannical ruler who was oppressing or destroying a State. 


Politicians in Sri Lanka have been greedy for power, prestige and money. Doesnt that mean that they had only focussed on external gratifications instead of inner satisfaction to serve the people. Nevertheless, former President Mahinda Rajapaksa was an exceptional leader who provided good leadership to win the war with the LTTE. MR unlike his predecessors used the JRs hybrid  the Executive Presidency and a devalued Parliament to his advantage for the first time, which JR himself had pathetically failed. However, why did he fail to understand the need to give leadership to a devastated country from peak to peak, after the war was over. How did he lose the grounding Did he also reject the honest critic who spoke the truth Furthermore, was he surrounded by sycophants who lied creating stories he liked to hear. Did they use power, charisma and communication skills to make the countrymen believe distortions, causing the government to lose touch with the reality by making serious omissions. Why is it that our political leaders fail to realise that they are ultimately responsible for the distressful lives and misfortunes of the people at present 
Being a Buddhist, let me add Gauthama Buddha was a social reformer. Emperor Dharmasoka had based himself on the teachings of the Buddha to run a government loved and respected by the people. However, Sri Lankan politicos are disparagingly no better than despotic rulers that had emerged in the African continent because they had failed to run statecraft through avoidance of conflict, war and violence rationally. 


Why do the masses come to the main roads in Sri Lanka in processions for demonstrations and block and cause massive disruptions to people on the roads to find solutions to various demands etc How does the Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) successfully paralyse and resort to so called trade union action in government hospitals without attending to the patients The government also seem to be incapable of handling the GMOA. How do they disregard blatantly their duties in the name of trade union rights and cause endless sufferings to the hapless public GMOA members also fleece patients mercilessly while doing private practice without any regard to humankind having been beneficiaries of free education. Shouldnt they ensure greater discipline and be of selfless service to people without destroying their reputation like politicians They should not forget that they have skeletons in their cupboards too. 


"An attempt to establish a similar private medical college in Ragama was prevented due to weighty opposition previously too"

Governments must not fail therefore to assert the position that Sri Lankan citizens must also have their private medical college as in the case of Nepalese and Bangladeshis and the like for the benefit of future generations. An attempt to establish a similar private medical college in Ragama was prevented due to weighty opposition previously too. The President must therefore stand up on behalf of the government and emphasise that it is the government that decides policy and not the GMOA or the student bodies of various universities. 
President should use his communication skills to emphasise that the establishment of a private medical college is essential as in the case of all other fields such as law, engineering, marine sciences etc. We must not forget how Chinese leadership  Deng Xiaoping made an announcement before they had to deal with the issue with firmness in Tiananmen Square. Our rulers should remember statecraft is difficult and the people expect a better deal from the present government. 
The Buddha could be considered the foremost enlightened classical philosopher, who revolutionised and introduced changes including radical egalitarianism and accepted gender equality  women too as spiritual equals etc. in the world. Buddhist teachings and social, political philosophy could therefore be considered as the most suitable form of governance in Sri Lanka, which had proved to be immensely successful during the times of ancient kings too. These policies and principles could be utilized by the present rulers to establish a well-managed democratic welfare state, with a deep sense of social responsibility with compassion, consideration, love, equality, with the hope that they would attend to statecraft to ensure law and order, and social harmony. 


Gauthama Buddha had emphasized that the ruler was a democratic conception of state and law based on the principle of equality chosen by the people, a great elect, (Maha Sammatha), who is empowered to rule based on the principle that they exercise authority only by the social contract as a compassionate ruler, which had been set out in the Sihanada Sutta  Dhasa Raja Dharma. 
Furthermore, having been able to contain the LTTE in 2009, if we do not successfully contain other political manipulations and numerous other issues, distortions etc. including unjust GMOA trade union action, irresponsible and misguided youth activities in a futuristic, fair-minded, open transparent manner, for the benefit of the countrymen, the delivery of aspirations of countrymen would be a distant dream. The government must be careful and should not permit GMOA to overstep their legitimate boundaries for any reason. GMOA too should support patriotically to create a more democratic society in which everybody gets equality, justice, fair-play without being abused so that future Sri Lankans could feel proud as a nation.

Parliamentary Committee on Public Enterprises (COPE) Chairman Sunil Handunnetti said yesterday he had not still decided whether to appear before the Presidential Commission of Inquiry (PCoI) to testify on the Central Bank bond issue.
He said it was not yet clear as to how the PCoI would conduct the investigations on this matter.
It is yet to verify whether its investigations will be based on the COPE report or whether it intends making COPE members respondents. Therefore the time is still not ripe to decide on appearing before the Commission, Mr. Handunnetti said.
However, he said he would do so if he and the other members were summoned by the PCoI.
COPE Member Harsha De Silva of the UNP said the members who represented his party at COPE will appear before the Commission if summoned.
COPE member Mahindananada Aluthgamage of the joint opposition said the Commission should summon COPE's present and former members including former Chairman D E W Gunasekera to testify on this matter.
A broad investigation is the need of the hour if the Commission is to mete out justice to the people of this country. I will appear before it if I summoned, he said.(Yohan Perera)

Gazette notification of electoral wards out by Feb 9
	
The gazette notification announcing electoral wards is to be released on February 8 or 9, clearing the way for conducting the local authorities election, officials said yesterday.
Local Government and Provincial Councils ministry secretary Kamal Pathmasiri has given this assurance to the chairman of the Election Commission. He has also assured him that the translation errors in the report submitted by the Delimitation Review Committee would be corrected today.
Mr. Deshapriya told Daily Mirror that he received an assurance that the gazette notification announcing the number of members to be elected under the new electoral system would be released during the following week.
Under the new system, which is a mix of the Proportional Representation System and the First Past the Post System, the number of members to be elected will increase.
We have identified around 50 shortcomings in the new election law. They seem minor in nature. Yet they have to be rectified. There are some discrepancies between the Sinhala version and the English. For example, there is an error in the translation of the term Polling District in Sinhala. According to the law, whenever there is a discrepancy, the Sinhala text prevails. So it has to be looked into, he said.
He said he requested the Legal Draftsmans Department to look into the matter.(Kelum Bandara)

Mahendran abused CB funds: JO
	
While referring to a review report of internal audit department, the Joint Opposition yesterday reiterated that former Central Bank Governor Arjuna Mahendran had misused Rs. 66 mn of Central Bank funds on 163 acts during a span of 17 months for his personal purpose.
Joint Opposition member MP Bandula Gunawardane told a media briefing that Mr. Mahendran had engaged in these financial impropriations with regard to the foreign travel and other expenses between February 1, 2015 and June 30, 2016.
Mr. Mahendran has violated the Schedule III of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) Travelling Allowance Rules as he had approved some officials including a Secretary to the Governor to travel in Business Class on their travel abroad, he said.
He said as per the rules the officials, except the Governor, Deputy Governors, Assistant Governors and the Heads and Additional Heads of Departments were selected by the Monetary Board to travel on duty abroad to be provided with the passage facility in Economy Class.
He said according to the report, Mr. Mahendran has made multiple hotel accommodations during same period during his visit to India for conference between India and IMF.
He said that Mahendran stayed in the following : ITC Maurya in Gurgaon, Imperial Hotel in New Delhi and Taj Palace F01 in New Delhi on March 10  13, 2016. However, the conference was held in Taj Palace, New Delhi.
It was observed that there were hotel reservations for extra guests for which audit evidences are not able to ensure whether they were official guests. There were also frequent cancellations of foreign travel by him, he said.
He said the report denoted that the monthly average expenses incurred through credit card by Mr. Mahendran was exceeding Rs. 2.1 million even though the monthly average official expenses incurred by him were Rs. 1.5 million.
Meanwhile, he requested the authorities to provide the Joint Opposition with an opportunity to reveal those facts to the Special Presidential Commission which has been appointed by President Maithripala Sirisena. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)

Cabinet approval had been granted to go ahead with the concept. The appointments would be made in near future, he said.
He said that these non-resident ambassadors would travel to assigned countries occasionally on their own expense.
Addressing the re-launching ceremony of the Consular Affairs Division at the Ceylinco Building in Colombo 1, the Minister said they were ready to shut down Missions which were inefficient.
In addition we will not be hesitant to open up new Sri Lankan missions in countries, where there is a need. This is why we recently opened an embassy in Ethiopia, where the African Union has its headquarters. Ethiopia has the potential to transform as the political capital of the Continent. We will also open a Consulate General in Cyprus, where there are many Sri Lankans. We have also received requests to establish a Consulate General in Madagascar, he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

## Title: Plastics detrimental to health and environment

Plastics detrimental to health and environment
	
From the chair we sit on, to the comb we use, to high tech machines, plastic has become indispensable as it is cheap and lightweight. It is popularly used in packaging and piping and is a material we encounter in various forms in our day-to-day life. However, the effects of plastic on the environment and on ones health outweigh its uses, as the consequences of its usage are drastic and irreversible. Plastic is non-biodegradable. It can persist without decomposing for a long time, polluting the environment. Daily Mirror spoke to a few experts on the magnitude of the problem at hand, who uncovered the hidden peril behind the use of plastics.
Speaking about the misuse of plastic, Dr. M.A.B. Prashantha, a senior lecturer at the Department of Chemistry of the University of Sri Jayawardenepura said cultural practices were mainly responsible for the misuse and the consequent damage. We are highly dependent and addicted to consumerism. So our social dynamics have changed from simplicity to a more complex context. Therefore we tend to buy more than our needs while consumerists produce different products to cater to this need. Thus there is an inflow of plastics in various shapes, he said. 
Often, we see people buying oil in shopping bags. Chemicals can leach into the oil. Garden hoses should not be used to provide water for drinking. Toxic chemicals are used to make this rubber. We dont know how much of them leach into the water. But we often see, especially at funerals, how drinking water is provided through the hose, he added. 
There is no practice among our people to carry a bag to purchase goods, he said. When we buy something from the market, it is also given in a polythene bag. We use plastic shopping bags unnecessarily, he added. 
PVC
Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) is one of the most used plastics in the world, though the use of PVC is phasing out in certain countries. PVC is a lethal plastic because it is fairly unstable. Manufacturers use additives to improve the stability of PVC. The additives can leach into the water and the soil. Ultimately, additives used can pollute the groundwater. It can enter the human body through food chains, said Dr. Prashantha. 
He said PVC plastic could affect the endocrine system (hormone system). Additives can accumulate in our fatty tissues and the additives can mimic the effect of hormones. This affects our endocrine system and central nervous system. Research shows that hormonal change can cause infertility, he added. 

Dr. Waruna Gunathilake
We have to be careful about plastic contact with food items. Food can be contaminated because of the leaching effect. Food grade plastic is relatively safe, but in our country, we are not assured as to whether the plastic used is food grade or not


Plastic bottles
Research has also established links between endocrine disrupting chemicals and diseases such as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, cancers, neurological effects and obesity. Bisphenol A (BPA), an endocrine disrupting chemical, leaches from polycarbonates (PC) such as plastic baby bottles at high temperatures and when reusing. Plastic bottles containing BPA (bisphenol A) are not used in the United Kingdom. In certain countries it is mandatory to include whether the plastic includes BPA or if it is BPA free, said Dr. Waruna Gunathilaka, the Head of the Toxicology Department of the National Poison Centre. 
PET bottles
PET (polyethylene terephthalate) bottles contain phthalates, which is a known cause for various cancers including prostate cancers. If the surface is indented, crushed or faded, one must refrain from buying them. It is not advisable to buy water bottles exposed to direct sunlight as certain chemicals can leach into the water due to the heat. This is why we need to recycle water bottles and not reuse them, said Dr. Ruwan Wijeyamuni, the Colombo Chief Medical Officer. 
Polystyrene
Similarly, we have problems with polystyrene (Styrofoam lunch boxes). It is bad when hot oily food is directly served onto the polystyrene, because the styrene can leak into the food, said Dr. Wijeyamuni. He added that this could cause allergic reactions and skin problems in the short term, while in the long run various alimentary tract problems and indigestion could be caused while it could trigger the growth of cancer cells. 
When you look at the death pattern of Sri Lanka about two decades ago, the main cause of hospitalized death was infectious and parasitic diseases. Now we have started to mimic the death pattern of the developed world where heart attacks, strokes and cancers dominate, he said, implying that plastics had a role to play in this. 
Commenting on polystyrenes, Dr. Gunathilake said there was no culture of using a lunch sheet over Styrofoam to serve food in the developed world. They usually use cardboard because it is safer, he said. 

Dr.M.A.B.Prashantha,a senior lecturer at the Department of Chemistry of the University of Sri Jayawardenepura
We are highly dependent and addicted to consumerism. So our social dynamics have changed from simplicity to a more complex context. Therefore we tend to buy more than our needs while consumerists produce different products to cater to this need. Thus there is an inflow of plastics in various shapes

Food grade plastic
We have to be careful about plastic contact with food items. Food can be contaminated because of the leaching effect. Food grade plastic is relatively safe, but in our country, we are not assured as to whether the plastic used is food grade or not, said Dr. Gunathilake. 
Citing an example of day-to-day misuse of plastic, he explained how kirihodi is often given in a red sili sili bag when buying string hoppers. Red and green are also chemicals. So with the heat of the gravy, chemicals can seep out of the polythene, he said. 
He noted how in other countries the quality of plastic products were regularly checked. The International symbol for food grade plastic is a wine glass and fork. The plastic should be able to maintain its composition and not affect the quality of the content it is used to protect, for instance, medicines. 
Straws are also plastic. But we dont know if they are food grade. We dont know what chemicals they use. We dont know the ingredients of lunch sheets either, he said. 
Recycling
Plastics should be recycled. However Dr. Gunathilake pointed out that certain provincial councils did not collect plastic waste which compelled people to burn them in their garden. Plastic should not be burned as it causes air pollution and pollutes groundwater. It emits dioxin and furan which are very toxic and act as a Persistent Organic polluter (POP), he said. Dioxin is carcinogenic and can cause throat, nasal cavity and lung cancers. 
Plastic is fat soluble, can enter food and can persist for a long time- for about 25 to 30 years. There should be a recycling procedure in this country, he added. 
When asked about the negative effects of plastic recycling, as chemicals could be emitted when melting them for the purpose of recycling he said, In the developed world plastic is incinerated in a controlled temperature plant where the damage can be minimized. 
Adding that there was neither a proper plastic reuse plan nor proper recycling taking place, Dr. Wijeyamuni quizzed as to whether people handed over used plastic bottles to recycling centres. PET bottles are recycled to a certain extent but how many of us are really returning PET bottles to these centres and how many centres do we have 
Shedding further light on this, Dr. Prashantha said that even if plastic was recycled at the end, it was dumped into the environment. When you recycle plastic over and over again, the grade decreases and its properties weaken. Ultimately it becomes waste, he said. 
Plastic is incinerated to produce energy. But when you burn plastic it emits carbon dioxide which contributes to global warming, he added. 

Dr.Ruwan Wijeyamuni,the Colombo Chief Medical Officer
PET (polyethylene terephthalate) bottles contain phthalates, which is a known cause for various cancers including prostate cancers. If the surface is indented, crushed or faded, one must refrain from buying them. It is not advisable to buy water bottles exposed to direct sunlight as certain chemicals can leach into the water due to the heat. This is why we need to recycle water bottles and not reuse them
Solutions
The use of plastic should be minimized. Ceramic-ware, glassware and stainless-steel ware could be used instead of plastic for storing and carrying goods. 
Dr. Gunathilake said that the developed world, especially the European Union, was attempting to minimize the usage of plastic through legislature. They are discouraging the use of plastic, whereas we are trying to popularize it. In the United Kingdom, 5 pence is charged for every plastic carrier bag, though it was free initially. After this legislation, the use of plastic bags has dropped, he said. 
Laws and regulations
When asked about the laws and regulations with regards to the use of plastic, Ajith Wijesundara, the Director of Waste Management at the Central Environment Authority (CEA) said there were Local Authority Acts and ordinances stating that they should manage plastic waste. In addition, there are provisions in the National Environment Act to not pollute the environment. Then there is a regulation banning the use, manufacture and sale of plastic and polythene below 20 microns. There are provisions in the Food Act of the Health Ministry regarding the ingredients of the polythene for medicines and food, he said. He added that though plastic should be disposed into landfills there were not many landfills in Sri Lanka.

UK, (Daily Mail, London), 4 February 2017- Tearing through the skies above the South Coast, two Spitfires evoke powerful memories of Britains wartime resilience. 
But this stirring image holds a further poignancy in the cockpit of the lead aircraft sits Mary Ellis, celebrating her 100th birthday by recreating her time as one of the Ata-girls, the select gang of female pilots who flew Britains fighters during the war. 
Wizard, this is wizard! yelled the delighted centenarian through her intercom. 
Mary was handed the controls of the 275mph twin-seater as it swooped over West Sussex. After about 15 minutes, she turned for home, and told her co-pilot Matt Jones: Goodwood on the nose, you have control. Then she settled back to enjoy the ride back to base.
