20A at this point may cause major problems: Wijeyadasa
	
Higher Education and Cultural Affairs Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe today said the presenting of the 20th Amendment to the Constitution on abolishing the executive presidency at a time such as this could pose a major problem.
After a visit to the Colombo Arts Gallery, he told the media that if the executive presidency was abolished at a time when even the local government bodies were unstable, the country would end up in anarchy.
There is a major issue with the 20A. This is not a personal or a party political issue, but an issue which effects the country. The executive presidency the Proportional Representation (PR) system were introduced together. There would not be major repercussions if the executive presidency was abolished while the PR system remained unchanged. However, the electoral system has been changed today resulting in hung local government bodies. The provincial council electoral system had also been amended, he said.
The minister said when all three levels of governance in the country including the Parliamentary system was changed resulting in hung governing bodies, the country would become a Somalia in the absence of an executive presidency.
Before making amendments, the repercussions should be properly evaluated, he said.(Lahiru Pothmulla)

Arisimalai encroachment: WHO IS TO BE BLAMED
	
Need of a national plan to protect the archaeological sites
Preserving sites of archaeological importance is vested upon relevant authorities. During the war, many of these sites were destroyed where ruins too came under the shower of mortar shells.
The East coast of Sri Lanka boasts of various such sites that date back to the ancient eras. Arisimalai is a small coastal village about 50 km north of Trincomalee in Pulmoddai. It is believed that two merchants Thapassu and Balluka, who had in their possession a lock of hair from the Buddha, was said to have landed at Arisimalai Beach, where they travelled up to Tiriyaya to deposit it in a shrine.
Due to this reason, there had been a large number of archaeological artefacts in this region and in the early 1980s, the Arisimalai Raja Maha Viharaya lying close to this beach has been granted a 500-acre block of surrounding land by the late Cyril Mathew, the then Minister of Industry. During excavations, ruins dating back to the Anuradhapura Era were found in and around the Arisimalai Temple, which was later identified and preserved under Gazette no. 1823/73. However, with illegal encroachment practices, the temple claims to be losing land at a rapid pace. During a recent visit to Trincomalee, the Daily Mirror visited the temple site in an attempt to shed light on this matter.


NATIONAL PLAN NEEDED TO PROTECT ARCHAEOLOGICAL SITES: NAYAKA THERA
Speaking to the Daily Mirror, the Chief Incumbent of the Arisimalai Rajamaha Viharaya Panamure Thilakawansa Nayaka Thera said that towards the end of the war, people have started to draft forged documents as means of encroaching land. Therefore people mislead the authorities and most of them are not even found in the records. Unfortunately, none of the officials is even bothered to take action against these individuals as well.
Using these documents, these individuals destroyed temples, while another person has arranged a deed including the Arisimalai mountain range and the Buddhist temples around it. Now they have even filed a case against me. Most of the lands are registered at the Archeology and Forest Conservation Department. Some people even protested against the construction of the Forest Department Office as well.
We spoke to the authorities to find a solution to this rapid encroachment of land. It is sad to say that these forest officials dont even have boots to wear when they go on patrols. But the blame game continues. When I go to the Police they asked me to go to the Forest Office and vice versa. Around the Nagalai Monastery even when the Forest Department have demarcated the boundaries these groups are continuing to cut trees. These people have even gone to the extent of showing documents which dont even belong to that particular piece of land. As a multi-religious and a multiethnic country, it is our duty to protect it. We meditate in monasteries and if they keep destroying these forests we will not have a place to meditate, Ven. Thera said. The historical monuments and other places of archaeological value need to be protected. Since we didnt see that necessary action is being taken by the authorities we educate monks in selected monasteries about preserving what is remaining, for future generations.
The residents in the surroundings dont bother about offering Buddha pooja, daane or gilan pasa.Except for some residents who come all the way from Padavi Sripura, we dont have many devotees here. We need a national plan to protect these archaeological sites and I cannot do that alone.


NO STAFF TO DEPLOY: ARCHEOLOGY DEPT.
Speaking to the Daily Mirror, W.H.A. Sumanadasa, Site Manager at the Archaeology Department Office in Kuchchaveli said that treasure hunters have started to rob statues of Gods and other items of historical value on the one end. Deforestation practices have reduced for some time but many of them have destroyed forest reserves with archaeological value. We too dont have the staff to deploy and guard these lands. Kovils have been built on various lands with archaeological value and people have started to visit them regularly. The 11 Divisional Secretariats for Trincomalee and there is a site manager for each Archeology Department Office. People dont like to work in these areas due to distance and lack of access to facilities.

The residents in the surroundings dont bother about offering Buddha pooja, daane or gilan pasa.Except for some residents who come all the way from Padavi Sripura, we dont have many devotees here.


ARISIMALAI TEMPLE HAS BEEN GIVEN 25 ACRES: DISTRICT SECRETARY
In his comments, Kuchchaveli District Secretary Pushpakumara Nissanka said that the Arisimalai Temple has been requesting 500 more acres to be given to the temple premises. But we have decided to give 25 acres under the Religious Lands Act, while 500 acres of forest reserve around the temple will be declared as an Archeological Forest Reserve. The Kuchchaveli District has a bigger population of the Muslim community. Some of them have settled down and have started to make a living. We are trying to settle things down and make sure that the people live in peace and harmony, he said.

Canned fish in a soup!
	
Health officials state that fish packed in tins and carrying a parasitic infection poses no threat to health even if consumed
The Ministry of Health recently sent a communique to senior state health officials concerning a batch of canned fish deemed unsuitable for public consumption, ensuing the lab tests conducted by the Imported Food Inspection Unit of the Food Administration Unit of the Ministry of Health. According to the communique, a meeting was held by the Food Advisory Committee of Sri Lanka on May 10, where it was agreed upon to remain vigilant as to whether such canned fish deemed unsuitable for consumption was available in the market and if so, measures would be taken to remove them from shelves immediately. The communique also included an annex with the list of canned fish along with their brand names, the batch numbers, dates of manufacture and expiry specified. Moreover, the learns through health officials, that the canned fish deemed unsuitable for public consumption doesnt pose any health risk even if consumed. However, measures have been taken to reexport the consignment to the country of origin since it doesnt meet the SLSI standards in addition to being identified as repugnant due to the parasitic substance found in them, the learns. 
Currently there are 60 consignments and 184 containers of canned fish
	the importing of canned fish from the country of origin has temporarily been curtailed
	every supermarket and grocery will be checked for unsuitable fish
No health risk posed through dead parasites
Commenting on the special communique sent to senior health officials at regional level, Secretary to the Food Advisory Committee and Director of the Food Control Administration Unit attached to the Ministry of Health, Dr. Sapumal Dhanapala explained that there are certain parameters the Sri Lanka Standards Institute (SLSI) considers to see whether a product meets the standard. He said that there was a sudden rise in March with regard to the number of imported canned fish that doesnt meet the SLSI standard mark. 
We had a meeting in April to discuss this matter and identified that the unusual rise in the poor quality of canned fish-which didnt meet the SLSI standard- was due to a dead parasite found in the fish. We had the meeting with the SLSI and the Food Control Administration Unit to see how we could streamline this issue. Based on this we started double checking the parameters even in our food labs from April on wards. Currently we have sixty consignments and 184 containers, which dont meet the standards. All these will be reexported to the country of origin for not meeting the SLSI standard. 
When we raised this issue at the Food Advisory Committee, because we know the batch number, manufacturer, the brand and related information, the Committee wanted us to circulate this information to the food inspectors at the district level and officials at the MOH level, to identify and ascertain whether any of the batches of canned fish could have leaked into the market through informal channels. We can only check on these imported canned fish at the border level and reexport on the border itself; these are the ones that genuinely come through the border system. But we arent hundred percent sure whether there could be any canned fish smuggled into the market through informal channels Dr. Dhanapala added. 
Stating that this is why a communique was sent, asking food inspectors to be vigilant of the batches, he further explained that it isnt particularly the brands that they are looking out for, but the particular batch number. We have given the batch numbers in all the consignments and where the batch number isnt available, we have listed out the date of manufacture and date of expiry since some companies dont mention the batch number on their products. From what I have heard through the SLSI, the importing of canned fish from the country of origin has temporarily been curtailed. 
There is no issue with food safety because if it was such an issue, then we will have to issue a red alert on the media and make sure that the public is made aware of it. But in the case of the dead parasite found in these canned fish, even if you eat it there is no health risk. However, since its repulsive to see dead parasites in food, we decided to reexport them he said. 
Consignment in question not released 
When inquired about the concerns of the consumer with regard to these canned fish, Consumer Affairs Authority Chairman Hasitha Tillekeratne said that there is no reason for the public to harbour fears since the consignment in question hasnt been released yet. He further noted that this issue doesnt come within the purview of the CAA. The consignment hasnt been cleared yet. This is an issue to be dealt with under the Food Act, which is controlled by the Public Health Inspectors. These Public Health Inspectors are attached to the Customs Department at the points of clearance. They have stopped the consignment, which hasnt been released to the country, he said.


Measures taken to implement communique
Speaking to , Chief Medical Officer of Health at the Colombo Municipal Council Dr. Ruwan Wijayamuni informed that the CMC has taken measures to implement the communique issued by the Health Ministry. I have asked my food inspectors, medical officers of health and the Public Health Inspectors, who are the authorized officers under the Food Act, to implement the communique issued by the Health Ministry to the latter. However, we couldnt find any unsuitable canned fish in the market. The manufacturers and importers have been informed about these canned fish and they have already cleared them from their shelves. Therefore, we havent found anything so far, but we are nevertheless on the lookout, said Dr. Wijayamuni. 
When inquired about the parasites found in the canned fish, Dr. Wijayamuni said that according to reports, worms have been found in the fish.
Stating that he has still not seen the parasites nor received a sample for testing, Dr. Wijayamuni added that the samples may have been taken and directly sent to the Government Analyst for testing. If we find any cans with the same batch number, we will confiscate and send them to our Analysts laboratory for testing. Then we can find out what type of worm has contaminated the fish; whether it is the worm usually found in the gut of the fish or if worms were produced because of spoiled fish. Since we havent got any samples, we cannot exactly say where the problem lies. We are waiting to receive a sample from those batches for testing. In any food product, the batch number should be there and we look for these batch numbers and the particular brands in this case. We are checking every supermarket and grocery in the locality to ensure that the canned fish unsuitable for consumption have been removed from their stores Dr. Wijayamuni added. 
As a consumer tip, its better to bear in mind to look for the label displaying the ingredients
Pros and cons of consuming canned fish
Speaking to the , Consultant Physician and Former Head of the Toxicology and National Poisons Information Centre at the National Hospital of Colombo, Dr. Waruna Gunathilake explained the positive and negative effects of consuming canned fish. According to Dr. Gunathilake one of the side effects of consuming canned fish is the high salt content in the food and its ingredients, which may also include certain additives such as various types of sauces. In the long run, the consumption of a high content of salt could result in causing high blood pressure in an individual. The fish cans may also be lined with BPA (Bisphenol A). The BPA chemical ingredient isnt good for the health because it has long term carcinogenic effects. Canned fish could also contain a high content of mercury, especially in large fish such as tuna. Since the fish is large, there is a high risk of the accumulation of heavy metals including mercury / methyl mercury. These are the untoward health effects of consuming canned fish in the long term Dr. Gunathilake said. 
As a consumer tip, its better to bear in mind to look for the label displaying the ingredients, since there could be certain industrial oils contained in canned fish. Secondly, it would be better to opt for smaller fish than larger fish due to the heavy metal concerns. On a positive note, canned fish is a good source of protein and especially Omega 3 and calcium. Canning is one good method of preservation since it helps increase the shelf life of foods. Canned fish can be considered as an emergency high protein diet, but its important to sensibly select them while ensuring the quality of the fish product, Dr. Gunathilake concluded.

Kim Jong Un arrives in Singapore for historic summit with Trump
	

North Korean leader Kim Jong Un landed in Singapore on Sunday ahead of his historic summit with US President Donald Trump, local media reported. 
Kim landed at Singapore Changi Airport at 2.38 pm (0638 GMT) on an Air China flight and was to be taken to the St Regis hotel, where his delegation is expected to stay, Channel NewsAsia reported. 
There was no footage of the leaders arrival. 
Trump was due to arrive several hours later from Quebec, where he attended the G7 summit with other world leaders. 
The Trump-Kim summit, which will be held at the Capella Hotel on Tuesday morning, will mark the first time a North Korean leader has met with a sitting US president. 
The talks will focus on reaching an agreement on the denuclearisation of North Korea in exchange for the easing of economic and diplomatic sanctions. 
As he departed on Saturday, Trump said he was on a mission of peace but also warned that the face-to-face talks were a one-time shot. I feel confident Kim Jong Un wants to do something great for his people, Trump said, adding that he wont have this opportunity again. 
He also insisted he would know within the first minute whether North Korea was serious about peace, using my touch, my feel to figure out the situation. 
There had been weeks of speculation about whether the meeting between the two leaders would actually happen, after Trump pulled out of the scheduled talks on May 24, citing Pyongyangs open hostility and tremendous anger.

## Title: LIBERAL REFORM PROGRAMME OF 2015: WHERE ARE WE TODAY 
## Section: Opinion
## Date: 11 June 2018 08:45 am
LIBERAL REFORM PROGRAMME OF 2015: WHERE ARE WE TODAY 
	
All the signs are that the 2015 liberal political program that was spearheaded by a broad coalition of social and political forces cutting across various divisions in society is disintegrating fast and the aspirations of a large majority of people in the country will remain unfulfilled or worse. The newly elected government could not get its act together and embark upon a clear and co-ordinated programme of economic, political and social renewal due to both economic challenges arising from accumulated debts and political disunity within. Misdirected populist measures like salary hikes for government servants, sudden removal of chemical fertilizer subsidy without giving the farmers a viable alternative, wasting money on useless projects under the guidance of close political associates rather than genuine experts, continued foreign borrowings for unnecessary projects like expressways, etc made the economic situation worse.

The Govt could not get its act together and embark upon a clear and coordinated programme of economic, political and social renewal due to both economic challenges arising from accumulated debts and political disunity within

Another major reason for the emergence of the volatile political situation is the regrouping of interest groups and ideological forces opposed to political and social reforms both within and outside the government. As for interest groups opposed to reforms, it is necessary to recognize the fact that the elaborate patronclient political system that existed prior to 2015 created a massive political constituency cutting across different strata and segments of society that remained loyal to the regime either due to ideological inclinations or naked self interest or both.
With such an elaborate political network, the then leaders did not feel the need to introduce progressive reforms in any sector. To give a few examples: state institutions were not revamped to serve the public or address issues that came under their purview but were politicized to accommodate political supporters and diverse interest groups. This was done even within the university system to a considerable extent.
Public resources were used to build up the patron client network rather than to cater to the needs of the people on an equitable basis. Even law enforcement agencies were micromanaged to serve sectarian interests rather than to enforce the law and deliver justice to citizens on the basis of the equality principle.
Corruption on unprecedented scale was allowed to spread across society at all levels so that some people in the political network could amass wealth. The resulting sense of injustice, immorality and insecurity felt by an increasing proportion of the population belonging to all communities prepared the ground for the emergence of the broad coalition against the previous regime mentioned above. The need of the hour was to adopt a new approach to governance based on widely accepted principles of good governance and modern social values of equality of opportunity, justice and tolerance of diversity.
Yet, the developments over the last three years have demonstrated clearly that the new regime has largely failed to live up to public expectations and frustrated many people who were committed to the liberal democratic project.
Even though the persisting issues such as growing income inequality, rural urban disparities, tensions among ethnic groups and rapid increase in private consumption, often at the expense of public c o n s u m p t i o n necessitated the new regime to go beyond liberalism and embrace social democratic policies, the balance sheet over the last three years shows that adequate measures were not taken to drive the country forward in the above direction.

Human Resources Development has received scant attention from the relevant Ministries and institutions. This is in spite of the fact that there is an HRD Council in the country maintained at public expense

While one of the biggest issues during the last regime was the blatant politicization of almost all public institutions, under the new regime also, many top appointments to important institutions were made on the basis of political and personal loyalties. A reliable and credible system to identify, scrutinize and appoint competent persons to head important state institutions should have been put in place at the beginning but instead both leaders of the government by and large followed the long established, discredited system of appointing friends, relations and political supporters. As a result, some institutions have already been ruined. As is well known, many diplomatic postings and appointments to important State enterprises were done in this manner.
Many other examples can be given to illustrate the main point mentioned above, namely, the new government perpetuated many poor governance practices that the people rejected at the last presidential election. But the point has been clearly made.
As is well known, minority communities contributed a great deal to the electoral triumph of the present regime in 2015. Yet, the leaders of the government failed to reassure and protect them when ultra nationalists in the south threatened Muslim communities in several parts of the country with violence. Members of the Muslim community felt that the State failed to take firm and quick measures to prevent or contain anti-Muslim attacks and swiftly enforce the law against the perpetrators.
The biggest blow to the credibility of the present government was the much talked about Central Bank bond scam. This needs no discussion here except to say that it provided a convenient cover for the members of the previous government to hide behind and take public attention away from many corruption allegations against several leading opposition personalities.
Reeling under heavy fiscal pressure arising out of accumulated domestic and foreign debts, largely inherited from the previous regime, government has not been able to make significant social investments in critically important sectors such as education, health, public transport and science and technology, all of which are very important not only to provide sustainable relief to low income groups, improve the life chances of restless youth, facilitate the transition from labour intensive to technology intensive development and create a conducive environment for private investment. Yet, the fallout from the bond scam, persisting political instability and uncertainty and the growing disunity among the members of the regime prevented any major inflow of foreign investment.
Meanwhile, increasing economic and social pressure encouraged large numbers of skilled and unskilled workers to look for work outside the country, making the already serious labour market situation worse. As is well known, the country had a distinct advantage with respect to availability and affordability of labour in the late 1970s making the country attractive to foreign investors but this situation changed rapidly over the last few decades making labour a real issue for local enterprises as well as foreign investors.
Yet, Human Resources development has received scant attention from the relevant Ministries and institutions. This is in spite of the fact that there is a Human Resource Development Council in the country maintained at public expense.
The lack of adequate investments in the education sector over the years resulted in a gradual decline in the quality of both general and higher education and the products of public education system became increasingly unemployable in a competitive private sector environment. The issue remained largely concealed due to both overseas migration of labour and the mass absorption of most of the educated unemployed into the state sector.
Yet, the persisting unrest among unemployed graduates has shown clearly that the failure of successive governments to address the problems in the public education system has not only hampered economic and social development but also led to unrest among youth, at times resulting in violent anti-State youth uprisings in the country. What is also noteworthy is that the declining quality of public education has also adversely affected the quality of teachers, politicians, professionals and public servants with serious implications. There is more than enough evidence to support the last assertion. It is against the above background that the successive governments have failed to bring about the necessary institutional and policy improvements to address the growing problems in the country. For instance, governments in recent years have done almost nothing to revamp the agricultural and industrial sectors when the open economic policies exposed them to international competition. Similarly, when the products of the public education system could not fit into the private sector due to lack of skills, little was done to equip them with the skills in demand.
Moreover, expanding private transport, private education, and private health services attracted more and more consumers, but nothing much was done to maintain publicly provided services to reduce economic pressure on households, forcing the latter to earn more money in whatever way possible. This has significantly contributed to the spread of petty and not so petty corruption in the country.

The successive governments have failed to bring about the necessary institutional and policy improvements to address the growing problems in the country

So far in the present article, I have made an effort to provide the background to the social and political issues that have emerged in the country over the last several decades, in particular, over the last few years. The only way to resolve these issues is to strengthen the institutional fabric of the State, adopt evidence based, rational policies in diverse sectors and develop and implement diverse interventions. This is exactly what was expected from the regime that came into power in 2015. But, today, we have a full blown economic, social and political crisis in the country, largely due to the inability of the regime to take the measures mentioned above on a priority basis in a coordinated . The reasons for this situation are many but the resulting public disillusionment and frustrations can only lead to a much worse situation in the country in the near future because people can hardly think of a better political alternative.
This is the dilemma that the citizens in this country are faced with today. So, it is absolutely necessary to mobilize the institutional and other resources at our disposal to come up with an urgent plan of action to deal with the situation. While the state institutions need to be activated to carry out their statutory mandates effectively, those institutions that deal with pressing problems of the ordinary people need to be prioritized. The other priorities of the country are well known and there is no need to repeat here

Medical specialists to refrain from private practice over unfair taxation
	
Medical specialists have threatened to abstain from private practice from June 18 if the authorities failed to restructure the tax policy on medical specialists, Association of Medical Specialists (AMS) said.
AMS President Dr. Sunil Wijayasinghe told Daily Mirror that according to the new tax policy of the government, tax amount imposed on medical specialists has increased from 12% to 24% from April 1 2018.
"If the doctor's fee is 1000 rupees, government gets VAT (Value Added Tax) Rs 150, income tax Rs 240 and Total tax of Rs. 390. So, patient pays a fee of Rs.1650 out of which minimum of Rs 390 are government taxes (23%). The amount of tax earned through hospital fee will be additional. Eventually your medical specialist gets only Rs. 760 from what you spend (44% of what you pay). Government saves money from state health and earn money from private sector," Dr. Wijayasinghe claimed.
He said the AMS and all others involved in this 'Medical Specialists Collective' would explore all the possible avenues to settle this dispute through negotiations.
"AMS has already had several rounds of discussions with relevant authorities on this matter. A crucial meeting will be held this evening with the Finance Minister. We will resort to action only if negotiations fail," Dr. Wijayasinghe said.
"This is only applicable for medical specialists. However, those working in the government hospitals will do their hospital duties as usual providing service at government institutions," Dr. Wijayasinghe added. He advised the general public to seek treatment from the government hospitals from June 18. (Sheain Fernandopulle)

Narendra Modi, Pakistan President shake hands at SCO Summit
	

QINGDAO (CHINA), (The Hindu), 10 June 2018 - Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday shook hands with Pakistans President Mamnoon Hussain and had a brief chat with him at the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit here. The two leaders, attended the 18th SCO Summit, shook hands after signing of agreements between the members states of the eight nation bloc.
Relations between India and Pakistan strained after an attack on an army camp in Uri by Pakistan-based terror organisations in 2016. The ties took a severe hit post-sentencing of Indian national Kulbhushan Jadhav by a military court in April last year.
India had also boycotted the 19th SAARC Summit after the Uri attack. The summit scheduled to be held in Islamabad in 2016 was postponed.Mr. Modi held nearly half a dozen bilateral meetings with leaders of other SCO countries. However, there was no bilateral meeting between Mr. Modi and Mr. Hussain.

Pradeep Edward and SLIM ready to empower marketing in Sri Lanka
	
The Sri Lanka Institute of Marketing appointed Pradeep Edward as the 40th President at this years Annual General Meeting. Pradeep is a dynamic personality with immense experience in the fields of Sales and Marketing.
He joined SLIM in 2000 where he completed most of his marketing related studies. He was appointed the Charter President of the SLIM MBA Alumni and the Director of SLIM CPM Society. In 2013 he was elected to the Ex-Co of SLIM and moved up the ranks as Assistant Secretary, Secretary, Vice President and President.
According to Pradeep, he did not stumble upon marketing as it was a conscious choice to join the dynamic field. His career began in sales, which made him aware of the value that marketing could bring into his profession. I liked the side of sales and marketing which enabled me to meet new people every day and gave many networking opportunities, he said.
It is with this step forward that he continued to add on to his professional qualifications as he realized that other areas such as finance and HR were equally important in building a business. I am a firm non-believer in having role models. My personal view is that there are leaders whom one can look up to and be inspired by, but one should not try to imitate them. It is important to understand your inner strength and develop yourself.
Pradeep Edward is the current CEO of Lanka Hospitals Diagnostics (Pvt.) Ltd. With over 2 decades of experience, out of which 15 years have been in the Managerial capacity and 8 in the level of General Manager/COO and CEO, his experience and knowledge makes him fit to lead the National Body for Marketing. He has served as a Judge and Technical Advisor at both local and international programmes such as the National Exporters Awards and Asia Marketing Excellence Awards and is a member of the National Branding Committee, appointed by the Department of National Planning of the Ministry of National Policies and Economic Affairs in coordination with the Export Development Board. The committee aims to developa strategic global campaign for Sri Lankan Exports.
In addition Pradeep is a Certified Marketer and Chartered Marketer of CIM  UK, and a Fellow member of the Institute of Management Specialists  UK. He has also served as President of the Pharma Promoters Association of Sri Lanka and Hon. Secretary of the Sri Lanka Chamber of the Pharmaceutical Industry. He holds an MBA from the Buckinghamshire New University, Postgraduate Diplomas in Marketing and Business Management as well as a Diploma in Finance.
Expressing his views about marketing in Sri Lanka, Pradeep stated, similar to many other areas, Sri Lanka has alot of talent in the field of marketing as well, but we fail to achieve the mark at the final outcome. I have been involved in several judging panels of several awards and seen the magnitude of thinking that is behind the campaigns which come from our very own region. According to him, a major drawback in the industry is that we tend to focus only in our area of expertise and as a result do not have a cohesive approach.
The country lacks international exposure and the President of SLIM is proud to declare that SLIM is in the forefront in bridging this gap. We initiated this by bringing down Philip Kotler. Last year we had Ron Kaufman conducting a Knowledge Forum and CEO Forum on Services Marketing. This year everything is ready for the forums with none other than John Mattone, coach of Steve Jobs, said Pradeep.
At events such as SLIM Brand Excellence, excellent products are showcased but are not marketed well enough to be brought from the village to the city, let alone to be marketed internationally. This is one of the reasons behind SLIM introducing Gamata Marketing, where the village based manufacturers are educated about the importance of marketing.
Under his leadership SLIM is also working on a few new projects to address the need of the hour in the marketing industry. We are currently planning an awardsprogramme for young entrepreneurs and start-ups, which is definitely the future of marketing. The idea behind it is similar to what we had when we launched the Digital Marketing programme at SLIM. Taking cue from the success of this course, we will launch the Digital Marketing Awards this year which is today only a category in Brand Excellence. SLIM has continued to be proactive in identifying and catering to the needs of the time in the marketing industry.
Sri Lanka as a country has a lot of potential and assets which other countries do not. In his opinion, it is important to understand the strengths we have and take every opportunity to brand and market the island. There is no worth in trying to imitate or follow what other countries do. It has not worked for us at all, he stated. We should also decide on what areas that we are to develop and do it gradually. What we are doing currently is that we try to develop all industries at once, which is not practical, he added further.
According to Pradeep, the issue we face in building the national economy is that we attempt to cover all industries at one go. He sees Tourism as an industry which we should focus on developing first. A majority of Sri Lankans can communicate in English and we are innately hospitable people. This is a key asset we have which most others do not. We should also get our segmentation right and aim for high-end tourists to improve the sector. This coupled with effective marketing can develop the industry tremendously.
The year under Pradeep Edwards leadership will be gearing up for a special year towards SLIM celebrating its 50th anniversary. The year is themed as The Year of Gratitude. Following the tradition of felicitating past presidents, he looks forward to including the backbone of the Institute; members, affiliated institutes and the SLIM staff. The laying of the foundation for the new SLIM building too is part of the plan for the year as well as setting up the SLIM archives to document and record the work and achievements.
The most important aim for Pradeep under his reign is to establish the womens association. Unfortunately SLIM has not produced a female president for the past 47 years. We have quite a number of active female members who have contributed to the growth of SLIM, and this year I have 3 ladies in my committee including the Hon. Secretary. We will be focusing on this area as we have some amazing women leading the marketing industry at present, he concluded. As for my Marketing Mantra there are 7Ps in marketing , but I strongly believe in only 1P and that is People, if we have the correct people and work with them all others will fall in line.

Taliban agrees to unprecedented Eid ceasefire with Afghan forces
	

KABUL AFP June9, 2018-The Taliban announced its first ceasefire in Afghanistan since the 2001 US invasion on Saturday, with a three-day halt in hostilities against the countrys security forces that was greeted with relief by war-weary Afghans. 
But the group warned the suspension of fighting for the first three days of Eid, the holiday that caps off Ramadan, did not extend to foreign occupiers, who would continue to be targeted by the militants. 
The unexpected move came two days after the Afghan governments own surprise announcement of a week-long halt to operations against the Taliban. 
It is the first time in nearly 17 years of conflict that the militants have declared a ceasefire, albeit a limited one. 
All the mujahideen are directed to stop offensive operations against Afghan forces for the first three days of Eid-al-Fitr, the Taliban said in a WhatsApp message to journalists. 
But it added that if the mujahideen are attacked we will strongly defend (ourselves).

The most brutal sport on earth
	
With the FIFA World Cup fast approaching it feels like everybody is indulging in the beautiful game, even if that does involve strapping tattooed men of Florence in this fiercely violent 'alternative' to football, Calcio Storico.
The sport, played out annually in the Italian city's Santa Croce square, takes the 'beautiful' out of the game and smashes just about everything in between the popular phrase.
This is an all-out slug-fest that sees opponents challenged to knock seven bells out of one another, as well as score some points, with nothing more than glory on offer as the prize.
The annual tournament is made up of four teams comprising neighbourhoods Santa Croce (blue), Santa Maria Novella (red), Santo Spirito (white), and San Giovanni (green).
Matches between two sides of 27 players take place over a gruelling break-free 50 minutes and no substitutions are allowed even if there are injuries  and there are plenty of those.
It was too brutal for some, most famously King Henry III of France who watched the 1573 Calcio Storico only to remark 'too small to be a war and too cruel to be a game'.
The game is played on sand in an area roughly the size of a modern day football pitch and combines elements of rugby and wrestling.
Teams scrap to keep possession of the ball and kick it over the fence at the opponent's end of the field.
Surprisingly there is a version of some adapted rules to help keep injuries to a minimum, including no one player being able to fight a single opponent at once, but judging by these photos that doesn't seem to be the case.
A lot of fighting techniques are allowed, including martial arts.
There is a referee with six linesmen who attempt to keep the peace.
But at any one time they have dozens of fights to deal with and players have been known to get knocked out before they can be reached.
The exact history of the Calcio is unknown, although a sport similar to the one played each June in Florence was popular with soldiers of the Roman Army before the city of Florence was even founded in 59AD.
While it was likely played in Florence throughout the 15th Century, the first recorded game took place in 1530 as Florentines played a match in Piazza Santa Croce despite the city being under siege by French troops.
Calcio is seriously dangerous although no deaths have been recorded in modern times. The match was banned for a year in 2007 however after a brawl involving 50 players were taken to court.
After that, new rules banned convicted criminals from taking part, reported. (Daily Mail)

Unilever Sri Lanka Marks 15 Years of Empowering Rural Women Entrepreneurs
	
Lauding the entrepreneurial spirit of the members of its unique Saubhagya Channel, Unilever Sri Lanka recognized the top 100 performers of Project Saubhagyaat its annual Diriya Pranama Awards held at the Galle Face Hotel, recently.
Ms. Champa Upasena, Director - Womens Bureau of Sri Lanka was the Chief Guest of the evening while Mrs.I. D. K.Sanjeewani Deputy Director (Social Development) - Samurdi Development Department joined in as a special guest.
Currently in its 15th year, Project Saubhagya is Unilever Sri Lankas key initiative under its Unilever Sustainable Living Plan pillar of providing opportunities for women and has emerged as a symbol of womens empowerment in the countrys rural areas. This unique initiative partners with rural women and gives them the opportunity to become direct-to-home ambassadors of Unilever brands thereby empowering them to become entrepreneurs in their own right. The guaranteed regular and sustainable income they earn through this goes a long way in helping the women improve their standard of living.
As a testament to the success of the programme and the capabilities of rural women, this years top entrepreneur for the third consecutive year was Mrs. R. N. Ranjani of the Monaragala district.17 entrepreneurs were recognised for long service, having been with the programme from its very inception.
At Unilever Sri Lanka, we firmly believe that the empowerment of women is central to driving and sustaining economic development at a national level. In line with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal of creating gender equality, Project Saubhagya is a key element of our efforts towards providing greater opportunities for women and empowering them financially. Helping improve their livelihoods, it also allows us to build stronger distribution networks and create a more sustainable business, said Unilever Sri Lankas Customer Development Director, Aruna Mawilmada. Lauding these ladies for their outstanding achievements, we look forward to working with more likeminded women across the island to grow our network of women entrepreneurs to 14,000, representing the 14,000 Grama Niladari divisions of Sri Lanka.
Project Saubhagya stems from a deep understanding of the difficulties faced by women in developing marketsand the integral part they play within Unilevers own distribution network. Initiated in 2003 with 5 brave women entrepreneurswho took the first step towards economic inclusion, the programme now engages over 5,000Saubhagyaentrepreneurs today.Unilever also equips them with basic knowledge on sales and accounts as well as health and hygiene to further support them in their journey towards greater economic inclusion.
Going beyond supporting women through such endeavors, Unilever Sri Lanka assists them with the education of their children through the Saubhagya Scholarships Programme. Scholarships were awarded to 26 students who excelled in the Grade 5 Scholarship exams, 9 students who scored 9 As in their Ordinary Levels (O/L) exams, 11 who secured entry into universities and 5 national level sports and aesthetics performers at the event.Unilever Sri Lanka also finances community development projects in their villages.

UNP IS AT IT AGAIN: CHANGING PARTY STRUCTURES, RULES AFTER ELECTORAL DEFEAT
	
By Devi Samarasinghe
Every election they lose the second tier leadership, have a morning after the night before reaction and run to the media to make excuses and rationalise the reason for the loss. And always it is the leadership. Ranil must go. A new leader will be the magic panacea. There is no other reason they can find or will find for if they were to dig deeper the finger would invariably be pointing inwards. These statements are not made after consulting voters or the party rank and file for that would take a reasonable time. They are made to turn away the focus from the organisers who have failed to win their electorates. And if enough organizers start pointing fingers at the leader then they delude themselves and the public that the problem is the leader and not any failure on their part to nurture their electorates.
The first question to ask these reformists is Did they not know that the defeat was coming. Prior to February 10, most organisers were confident of victory. Take the example of Ajith P. Perera who gave an interview of how they would sweep the polls. How is it that they had no idea whatsoever of the mood of the electorate that rejected them in this manner. Is it not a clear indication of how out of touch they were with the voters. If on the other hand they knew what the outcome would be why did they not take remedial action specially by alerting the party hierarchy. When their expectations based on their misreading the electorate are not fulfilled they find an easy scapegoat in the leader and start the blame game. The truth is that they were caught napping completely out of touch with the voters. Most were elevated to the rank of minister and were busy enjoying the perks. The new cars the trips abroad and of course the side deals.
They have been too busy with all the extra to focus on the electorates. Let each MP inform the party of the list of development activities done in his/her respective electorate as well as the level of their out reach. How many UNP societies have been established and what have their programmes been. Most organizers have not even checked The electoral registers in their electorates. The Rajapaksas are masters of out reach and their wives had extensive societies that went deep into villages. What becomes more important changing who signs the cheques in Sri Kotha or reaching the grassroots
We have to now ask how many of those now formulating winning strategies actually won their electorates For one must get guidance on winning from a winner. Can an organizer who failed to win the electorate for the party start pontificating on how to win the country for the partyThis itself demonstrates how out of touch with reality and the road to success they are. Should they not analyse what went wrong in the electorates. For example it is accepted that the failure to get flood relief to the affected caused a drop in the votes. Why did the organizers not act fast and hard to get the voters this relief. Why were no steps taken to name and shame MR-appointees who were blocking these. Shaming the leader is no problem for many in the party but shaming miscreants on public issues seems to take a backseat.
Many reformists will claim that they are accepted by a sizable number of voters and this itself is one of the main problems of the party. All candidates campaign across a district for preference votes and invariably neglect the electorate. They lose the electorate but enter parliament thanks to the preferential system. Their thinking and actions are geared to building an image across the district which employs different strategies and they are dumbfounded when they lose in a first past the post system. What is required of every organiser is that he/ she nurses electorates on a first past the post basis to ensure that the party wins across the board.
In this respect it would also be beneficial if the reforms were to include a provision that an organiser who lost the electorate three times gives up his seat even if he gets in on the preferential system. It would be futile to state that a leader must resign if the party loses if a similar provision does not apply to party organisers who are the party leaders for the electorate.
A fact that the reformists have to face is that there are many accusations of corruption against the UNPers in the past three years. Whilst there is frustration that those guilty of corruption in the past regime have not been punished voters have also watched the assets of many MPs rise and know that they are not cleaner than the last lot. Brothers who suddenly own fuel sheds, in-laws who emerge in BMWs, daughters who buy apartments, surround the MPs apart from their security and we realise that there is no real change. Unuth ekai munuth ekai [no difference between the predecessor and the successor] as the JVP says the reforms have to take measures to stop this rot.
Today we have a situation where a party leader who has won the district he represents and has a record for the highest number of preference votes in Sri Lanka being asked to leave by a set of MPs who have lost their electorates.That these include upstarts like Hirunika Premachandra who joined the party very recently and turncoats like Vasantha Senanayake make it imperative that the reforms include disciplinary action against MPs who break ranks.
The need for democracy in the party is another reason given for the reforms. Has there been a more feudalistic party than the SLFP under Bandaranaikes and Rajapaksas Who would dare demand reforms and leader ship changes from Mahinda The SLFP has marched to success under a tough leader and the rot had set in once the tough leader had gone. The reforms are based on the premise that the leader is responsible for the defeat and concentrate on changing the structure to broad-base decision making but do not appear to target the elections to come. For the UNP must win presidential and general elections to govern effectively. Even If the Presidential is won it is unlikely that the UNP would form a government as without the minority votes they would not be able to get a majority and many reformists who threw the leader out would find themselves at home too realizing too late that their electorates do matter as much as their preferential votes. It is highly unlikely that even a new leader will get a outright majority in parliament and would he then have the experience and strategic capabilities of Ranil Wickremesinghe to maneoeuvre the party through to carry out a programme for the country. Have the reforms even looked that far or are they merely to give vent to the frustration of losing 
Any reforms made any action taken must target victory in a coherent and credible manner. The reformists must have the courage to look inwards and rectify themselves to market themselves to the electorate. They must reform themselves as well for without this action on their part the reforms would be as effective as changing the paint of the Siri Kotha walls to win an election.

US - N.KOREA SUMMIT AND THE US PIVOT TO ASIA
	
News that US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un will hold a summit meeting at a venue in Singapore on June 12 this year were confirmed by the White House spokesperson. The on-again-off again summit was given a new lease of life after Trump hosted Kims representative who brought with him a personal letter from Kim to the US leader.
According to the White House spokesperson, US personnel are already in Singapore finalising arrangements. They will remain in place the statement added until the summit. The spurt of activity surrounding the summit, signals a shift of US interest from West Asia to East Asia a continuation of Obamas Pivot to Asia. The Middle East riven with conflict is important to the US and its western allies because of its vast reserves of oil and natural gas... These supplies though dwindling are still important and the west needs the conflict to control the resources of the region. Thanks to Israeli involvement in the conflict, the flames of disquiet in the ME may never be doused.
Should we, as Asians, not be concerned regarding the shift of US interests from West Asia (Middle East) to East Asia. The US Pivot to Asia did not start all of a sudden. As far back as in 2006 according to Livescience,US researchers flew airborne missions to conduct magnetic, gravity and hyper spectral surveys over Afghanistan after it captured power from the Taliban and learned from maps and studies of Soviet era geological maps and reports up to 50 years old or more that hinted at a geological gold mine in that country. The missions corroborated the findings of the Soviet reports. At that time the US was also sowing seeds of dissension in West Asia and gradually bringing about regime change in countries whose policies did not align with western interests.
Today China is posing a challenge to US hegemony world-wide, both economically and militarily and the US has begun championing the freedom of the oceans in the South China Sea on behalf of states like Japan -which it (US) nuclear bombed and fire-bombed at the end of World War II. Vietnam, whose citizens it subjected to chemical gas and napalm attacks, and the Philippines on whom the US kept in place dictator Ferdinand Marcos despite continued human rights abuse, until his violent overthrow.
Asia is rich in mineral resources.
According to Encyclopaedia BritannicaAsia has enormous reserves of coal amounting to nearly three-fifths of the worlds total resources. Britannica also points out that two-thirds of the worlds known crude oil and natural gas are also found in Asia, with many of the island chains bordering eastern Asia having geological formations favouring petroleum accumulation and oil fields both on land and off-shorein the Indonesian islands of Sumatra, Java, Borneo, China and in Brunei. The area of the South China Sea is said to contain large petroleum deposits, but disputes among the surrounding countries about sovereignty over the Spratley Islands has inhibited development. Significant deposits of natural gas were discovered in Bangladesh during the 1990s.
Reserves of uranium ore are found in Asias ancient crystalline rocks. China and India have their own deposits.
Many regions of Asia have deposits of iron ore. The Philippines exports ore. Malaysia produces a considerable volume. Thailand, Myanmar, and Pakistan have fair amounts of relatively low-grade ores. Vietnam has good ores in substantial volume. Indonesia and India both have large deposits of good iron ores.
China has huge quantities of varying grades of ores and ranks among the worlds major producers of iron ore.
According to LiveScience Despite being one of the poorest nations in the world, Afghanistan may be sitting on one of the richest troves of minerals in the world, valued at nearly $1 trillion, according to US Scientists.
Afghanistan may hold 60 million tons of copper, 2.2 billion tons of iron ore, 1.4 million tons of rare earth elements such as lanthanum, cerium and neodymium, and lodes of aluminum, gold, silver, zinc, mercury and lithium. For instance, the Khanneshin carbonatite deposit in Afghanistans Helmand province is valued at $89 billion, full as it is with rare earth elements.
The US Pivot to Asia bodes ill for the Asian region. Unless countries in the region amicably settle their differences here there is a real danger Asia too, like the Middle East will soon go up inflames.

We couldve done certain things differently: Gota
	
While reiterating that local and foreign elements attempted to drive a wedge between the Rajapaksa government and the Muslims, former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa said that he agrees that they could have done certain things differently without leaving room for opportunists.
He expressed these views during an Iftar Ceremony organized by the National Muslim Collective, which was held at the Galle Face Hotel in Colombo on Friday.
Mr. Rajapaksa said these efforts, to create a wedge between the Muslim Community and the Rajapaksa government, were done in an organized manner.
The lies that were spread within the community and actions that were instigated to cause unfortunate incidents led to a perception that the Muslim community has a cause to be wary of the Rajapaksa administration. This is very far from the truth. However, those Muslim leaders who work closely with me and the former government, know very well that we took great care to uphold the security and dignity of the Muslim people under very sensitive circumstances, he said.
He said the false impression created by the lies and orchestrated incidents was so strong, that they were unable to convince many in the Muslim community about the sincerity of their actions.
This was a trust deficit that contributed to the unfortunate defeat of President Mahinda Rajapaksa in 2015 and halted the rapid progress Sri Lanka was making. However, that is the past. Soon, we may have another opportunity to continue that journey of progress. We have engaged in continuous dialogue with religious leaders and the elders of the Muslim community and will continue to discuss the issues that trouble you, the fears that you have and the measures that can be taken to resolve them, Mr. Rajapaksa said.
He said the intention of the Rajapaksa Government was always to create a nation where Sinhalese, Muslims, Tamils and people from every community in this country can get on with their lives, knowing that they are safe. If we can all come together once again, I am sure we will be able to achieve this. That will be to the lasting benefit of all Sri Lankans living in this country today and for all our future generations. It is something I hope, we can all work towards, he told the Iftar gathering.(Lahiru Pothmulla)

## Title: WHAT INFLAMED BIGOTRY  A RESPONSE

WHAT INFLAMED BIGOTRY  A RESPONSE
	
I refer to the above titled article in the dailymirror of June 1 by Uditha Devapriya (UD) and respond to some of the views expressed therein. The main thrust of this article is that, racial/religious bigotry is the result of the mundane economic reason than the racial/religious feelings of a community. This is an over-simplification of a deepseated emotional element, which is the fundamental reason for arousing religious/racial bigotry. The economic element is a peripheral, marginal and an enhancing contributory factor only, if at all, and not the core reason. This emphasis on the economic reason for the racial riots, in my view, is wittingly or unwittingly, to exonerate the Sinhala community of any trace of racism.


ECONOMIC REASONS ADDUCED
The economic reasons given are, specifically related to the recent violence unleashed on the Muslim community by the Sinhala mobs and extremists elements, in Aluthgama and Kandy regions. UD states that racism begins with the economic as opposed to the religious or communal. However, he cites the recent violence against the Muslims, which is localised, sporadic and limited, and leaves aside the generalised, organised, premeditated, and large scale communal riots against the Tamil community, in 1958 and 1983. Accordingly, the economic issues he refers to are:
(a) Multiplication of Muslim population
(b) Halal Certification
(c) Economic hardships
Other than (c ) above, (a) & (b) are social and communal related, and has nothing to do with economics. UD argues that economic adversity of rising cost of living, taxes, economic hardships, give rise to social tensions, disunity, and disharmony with other communities and breeds hatred. Economic issues and hardships do not affect only one community, but common to all communities. If so, how could it be the reason for hatred and disharmony between different communities. This is a question of haves and the havenots, irrespective of communities. This economic disparity does not correspond exactly to a communal divide. Even within each community, there exist a disparity between the haves and have- nots. Does this manifest in hatred, violence and riots within communities No. Therefore, the truth is that, it is not economic but emotional disapproval and antipathy that inflames bigotry, based on religion and race. No amount of economic rationalization can deny the racial and religious element that incites bigotry and violence.


COMMUNAL RIOTS AGAINST TAMIL MINORITY
UD, either by intent or inadvertence, does not mention the communal riots against the Tamil minorities. This is understandable, because he will not find the said economic reason, which inflamed bigotry for communal riots by the majority Sinhala community against the Tamils. What inflamed riots against the Tamils was, pure and simple, bigotry of race and religion and not economics, in 1958 and 1983. Communal riots of 1958 and 1983, were not riots between two communities, Sinhala and Tamil, where there is mutual attack and violence between two communities. It was onesided, the Sinhalese rioting and attacking the Tamils, who were the passive, helpless victims.


WHAT INFLAMED RACIAL/RELIGIOUS BIGOTRY
Two factors inflamed racial/ religious bigotry of the Sinhala Buddhists:
(a) The remote, Historical factor, and
(b) The post independence, Political factor.


HISTORICAL FACTOR
From 2nd century B.C. two Chola invaders from South India, invaded and ruled Sri Lanka for 22 years, followed by Ellalan [Esala] for another 44 years. Dutugemunu defeated the latter and wrested rule. This symbolised the beginning of Sinhala nationalism. A lurking distrust and enmity against the Tamils continued to linger and haunt the Sinhalese even to the present day, creating a religious/ racial hatred amongst the Sinhala majority community.


POLITICAL FACTOR
With the gain of Independence from the last colonial rulers, the British in 1948, Political power passed into the hands of the majority Sinhalese, marginalising the substantive Tamil minority. Sinhala nationalism was on the ascendancy, leading to discrimination and antipathy against The Tamils.


BIGOTRY OF RELIGION AND RACE
UD asks, what inflames Bigotry, rather than asking who inflames bigotry of race and religion, which is most crucial. In my view, it is inflamed by following segments of the Sinhalese, such as:
(a) Although, a Majority of the Sinhalese masses are not given to racism, but being ignorant and uninformed, they become a prey to the machinations of:
(b) The, Political class and the Buddhist Clergy, who inflames (a) above, by conditioning and indoctrinating by racist/religious rhetoric, particularly the Politicians ,who rouse racial/religious sentiments of the masses, which is the easy road to gain political power. Rival Sinhala Political Parties compete against each other to be more nationalistic than the other.
(c) The educated Sinhala urban middle class, non-secular Business class and the Intellectuals and professional class, who propagate racist/religious sentiments for racial and political hegemony.
(d) The liberal and secular-minded educated and informed Sinhala people, who are mindful of the extremism of the Sinhala/ Buddhists elements, are a voiceless, powerless and a helpless class.
(e) The Constitution of the Country itself inflames racial and religious bigotry, by legitimizing it, by entrenching a clause for foremost place for Buddhism.
In short, this racial/religious bigotry of the Sinhala Buddhist majority is nourished by a false notion of the ancient history of Lanka and a false notion of superiority of race and religion (similar to Hitlers Harren Volk doctrine) and a false presumption that Tamils are outsiders and aliens who were brought into Lanka by the later colonial rulers to serve on their plantations in the 18th and 19th century A.D. The Sinhalese feign ignorance of the truth that, Tamils and other Dravidians existed from pre-Vijayan and pre-Buddhistic times, millennia before the evolution of a Sinhala identity.

Wrongdoers using Maithri Gunaratne as cats paw: JVP
	
The Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) said today some people hell-bent on protecting their sons-in-law, who obtained financial inducements from Perpetual Treasures Ltd., were employing individuals like Maithri Gunaratne as a cat's paw to sling mud at the JVPers.
JVP MP Vijitha Herath said this in the wake of Mr. Gunaratne accusing JVP MP Nalinda Jayatissa of having received money from PTL owner Arjun Aloysius.
Mr. Herath told a news conference that Mr. Gunaratne was carrying out a mud-slinging campaign against Mr. Jayatissa, who spoke out against fraud and corruption in and out the COPE.
The thieves are making false allegations against MPs who are fighting against fraud and corruption in a move to cover up their theft. It is reported that sons-in law of some people had obtained money from PTL owner Aloysius and to suppress these allegations, some people were spreading baseless rumours against Mr. Jayatissa, he said.
Mr. Herath challenged Mr. Gunaratne to prove the allegations against Mr. Jayatissa and added that they would not allow anyone to protect sons-in-law and suppress allegations against them.
He said the names of those who were alleged to have obtained money from Aloysius should have been revealed earlier and added that it was prevented as the full report of the Presidential Commission on bond scam was not presented in parliament.
Mr. Herath said the rest of the bond commission report should be presented in parliament as the Attorney General had also ruled that there was no legal barrier to doing so.
People have a right to know who obtained money from Aloysius, he said and added that another Presidential Commission should be appointed as promised by the President to investigate PTL activities of the PTL which were not investigated by the PCoI.
The President has not presented the three special acts to recover the public money looted by the PTL as promised. He also promised to review the progress of the investigations each month. But nothing has been done in this regard, he said. (Ajith Siriwardana)
