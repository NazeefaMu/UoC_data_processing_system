EC under pressure by JO to hold LG polls: JHU
	
Members of the joint opposition are pressuring and threatening Elections Commissioner Mahinda Deshapriya to hold the local government elections, Jathika Hela Urumaya (JHU) National Organizer Nishantha Sri Warnasinghe said today.
He said such pressure on the EC could lead to an election without implementing the proposed electoral reforms but instead under the much criticized previous preferential voting system.
Mr. Warnasinghe told a media briefing that according to informed sources, the LG polls were going to be held under the preferential voting system as a result of pressure by the joint opposition despite the fact that delimitation activities were yet to be completed.
He warned that it would be a violation of the peoples mandate if the elections are again held under previous system which was rejected by the people who voted in favour of the current government introducing electoral reforms.
Mr. Warnasinghe urged the government to refrain from holding the LG polls without completing the delimitation process and implementing ward-based electoral system.
Commenting on the new political party, Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna, he said the helpless former MP G.L. Peiris was sacrificed by appointing him Chairman of the party with its flower-bud symbol.
Wasnt there any one better than G.L. Peiris Why couldnt Basil Rajapaksa, Kumara Welgama or Prasanna Ranatunga take the leadership of their party The lack of confidence and policies of those party members is clear from not being able to elect a leader to head the party, Mr. Warnasinghe said.

Federal experts in sub-committee: Threat to SL's unitary nature
	
PHU General Secretary and MP Udaya Gammanpila yesterday claimed there would be a risk to the unitary nature of Sri Lanka because of the intervention of federal experts in the proposed new constitution based on the resolution approved in Parliament on March 9.
Mr. Gammanpila said the proposals in sub-committee report on the Central Government and Provincial Councils had proved that there was a conspiracy to include federalism in the proposed new constitution.
The government has repeatedly stressed that it would not compromise on the unitary nature of Sri Lanka. But the situation has changed with there being none to speak up on the unitary state in the sub-committee though there are several federal experts in it, he said.
The MP said this would lead to the setting up of a Constitutional Assembly based on racism.
He said according to the sub-committee reports the police powers were to be devolved to the provincial councils.
The central government should retain police powers, the MP said and warned that if there were to be a war in Sri Lanka in the future, it would be between the Army and and the Police in Northern Province.
He said the sub-committee report proposes to hand over ownership of the lands in the Northern Province to Chief Minister C.V. Wigneswaran who is currently on a mission to expel Sinhalese from the Northern Province.
Giving powers to the provincial councils will mean supporting Mr. Wigneswaran. It is evident from his actions that he is racially motivated, the MP said.
Meanwhile, he invited patriots to refrain from voting for the proposed new constitution in a referendum. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)

## Title: Fisher leaders disappointed over outcome of talks with SL

Fisher leaders disappointed over outcome of talks with SL
	
A cross-section of fisher leaders has expressed disappointment over the outcome of the recent high-level meeting between External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj and Sri Lankan Foreign Minister Mangala Samaraweera in Delhi to find a solution to the long-standing livelihood issue of Tamil Nadu fishermen.
We are not at all satisfied with the decision to set up a Joint Working Group (JWG), joint patrolling and hotline between the Coast Guards of the two countries to address the issue as none of the measure would help to find a solution to the issue, a leader who was part of the delegation that held talks with their Sri Lankan counterparts, ahead of the high-level meeting, said.
The leaders had high hopes that the two governments would work out a solution and allow Tamil Nadu fishermen to fish in the Lankan waters in the Palk Bay for specific period till they switched over to deep-sea fishing or phased out bottom trawling; but, they were disappointed.
The whole exercise turned out to be futile and it was totally disappointing, U. Arulanandham, president of the Alliance for the Release of Innocent Fishermen (ARIF), told The Hindu . It was shocking that Ms. Swaraj could not prevail upon the Sri Lankan government to secure the release of 115 boats detained in the island nation for more than one-and-a-half years, he said.
Most of the boats were badly damaged and the fishermen would receive only some wooden planks and scraps when the Sri Lankan authorities returned the boats, he rued. The Tamil fishermen from northern Sri Lanka, who were crying foul about destruction of marine resources, should understand the steps taken by the State government to protect the marine resources, he said.
Mr. P. Sesu Raja said it was unfortunate that the Indian government, which wrested an assurance from the Sri Lankan government that the fishermen would not be attacked, failed to secure an assurance that they would not be arrested till alternative arrangements were made.
It was also distressing to note that Ms. Swaraj could not secure the release of the mechanised and country boats held in Sri Lanka, he said.
Mr. M. Ilango, leader of the National Fishworkers Forum (NFF), said the decision to set up a JWG was only an eyewash. If Ms. Swaraj and Mr. Samaraweera could not decide on securing the release of the boats, it will be foolish to hope the JWG will secure the release, he said.
The decision to set up joint patrolling and establish hotline between the two coast guards was aimed at chasing away the Tamil Nadu fishermen, he said. No doubt Ms. Swaraj, recovering from an illness, took sincere efforts to find a solution, but the exercise went in favour of the Sri Lankan fishermen, he alleged.
Both India and Sri Lanka failed to note it was the livelihood issue of Tamil Nadu fishermen and it has to be approached with a humanitarian touch, he told The Hindu .

Senkadagala Finance Rs.3bn debenture oversubscribed
	
The fortnightly period from October 25 to November 7, 2016 witnessed a mass of debenture issues, where six debt issuances (four from banks) aspiring to raise a total value of approximately Rs.36 billion, were vying each other for subscriptions.
Amidst the cluster of debenture issues, Senkadagala Finance PLCs Rs.3 billion, rated, senior, unsecured, listed, redeemable debenture issue was successfully oversubscribed within the initial few hours of opening the issue, receiving approximately Rs.4 billion worth of applications. Hence, the subscription list was closed at 4:30 p.m. on the same day of opening.
The company issued 20,000,000 senior, unsecured, listed, redeemable, rated debentures of Rs.100.00 each to raise Rs.2 billion (Rs.2,000,000,000), with an option to issue a further 10,000,000 of the said debentures to raise up to Rs.1 billion (Rs.1,000,000,000) in the event of an oversubscription of the initial tranche. The issue was rated BBB+(lka) by Fitch Ratings Lanka Limited.
Notably, the attractive coupon rates offered makes way for a lucrative investment, especially in the light of the existing tax exemptions present for listed debentures. The issue comprised of three variants of two-year, three-year and four-year debentures, offering the investors an ideal opportunity to fix their returns at 12.50 percent p.a. semi-annually (AER - 12.89 percent), 13.25 percent p.a. semi-annually (AER - 13.69 percent) and 13.75 percent p.a. (AER  14.22 percent), respectively. Floating rate options were also offered at 1.50 percent and 1.75 percent premium over the six months gross treasury bill rate for the three-year and four-year
tenures, respectively.

They offer both fund-based services such as leasing, hire purchase financing, pawning and pledge loans as well as fee-based services including insurance brokering an IT-related consultancy.
The debenture issue follows on the wake of a very successful quarter for Senkadagala Finance PLC, with net profits seen soaring by 69 percent toRs.236 million and net interest income by 28 percent to Rs.1.1 billion, as at September 30, 2016 in comparison to the corresponding quarter of last year. The 9 percent improvement in the deposit base to Rs.6.85 billion also bears testimony to the solid growth achieved by the company, continuously for the past few years.
The debenture issue was jointly managed by Areva Investments (Pvt.) Ltd and Capital Alliance Partners Ltd and the proceeds raised from the issue will be utilized to expand the lending activities of the company.

Small car prices come down in SL ahead of budget
	
Car dealers were aggressively advertising discounted prices on small cars amid expectations that Thursday's budget could see another revision of tariffs that will favour smaller vehicles.
Associated Motorways, the agents for the popular Suzuki brand was offering discounts of up to 200,000 rupees and urged buyers to "beat the change, own it today."
Micro cars were also advertising a 100,000 rupee reduction on their small car Panda.
Usually, car dealers urge prospective buyers to beat the budget through which duties are increased, but this time they are careful not to suggest a duty increase.
The move after Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake announced he wanted to make ownership more affordable and tax usage.
However, on bigger cars with an engine capacity of 1,000 cubic centimetres, the duty calculations are likely to be revised with a possible increase in retail prices.
Taxes on three models - Toyota Premio, Toyota Allion and Honda Vezel - were increased between 220,000 to 384,000 rupees from the start of this month because of an increase in the retail price of the manufacturer. (economynext)

Some LLRC proposals can be implemented: PM
	
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe yesterday said that some recommendations of the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission (LLRC) that could be implemented would be put into practice in the coming years.
The Prime Minister made these remarks at last evening's commemoration lecture on one time Attorney General C R De Silva who chaired the LLRC.
Mr Wickremesinghe was referring to late Mr De Silva who was his classmate with his pet name Bulla.
Late Mr De Silva chaired the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission (LLRC). Its recommendations were controversial; I agreed with some and disagreed with others. I asked Bulla you could have hit harder but why you didnt do it. He said he would have put something more but chances of being accepted was far less. I wrote a document but could not persuade. There are some things in the LLRC to be rounded up and finished up in the coming years, the Prime Minister said.
He paid a glowing tribute to late Mr. De Silva by recalling that late attorney general was a man who stood for the rule of law.
Bulla believed that the judiciary should be above controversy. If the judiciary is controversial, the rule of law would suffer. You have to uphold the rule of law. To that all of us are committed whatever differences we have. I am happy as Bulla was one of those who contributed to keep the rule of law alive, he said.
"Last Friday I read a judgment which gave a lot of hope to the rule of law. That was by the high court of UK. That was a judgment on the secretary of state on the exit from Europe. The Attorney General contended that UK could have exited from Europe by informing European Union under article 50 of European treaty. Article 50 said, once you trigger the exit, you give notice but if you are not successful you are out in two years time. The other side contended that once you trigger there is no going back. The Parliament has passed a law, the European community law. There was a referendum to join the EU, the law was passed and the treaty was applicable in UK. There were a fair number of new rights and benefits to the citizens of UK. The Parliament said they cant now exit and take away the rights. The queen or the executive cannot override what was done by Parliament. This was interesting judgment as there was a notion that the executive is higher than Parliament. The UK court's action to uphold the rule of law is applicable to all. Bulla also stood for the rule of law in the same way, he further said. (Yohan Perera)

It is a general opinion in the country that politicians holding high office are a tribe seeking a life of luxury at public expense.
Some such political high-ups not content with ordinary luxuries are out to enjoy super-luxuries. Here is a case in point: A certain Minister has acquired a multi-purpose super-luxury chair at the cost of Rs.5 lakhs. This expensive chair is said to be equipped with a number of utility features which an ordinary swivel chair does not have.
Even the authorities in the highest echelons in the country are not provided with super-luxury chairs like this to perch their posteriors on, they say.

Wooing at public expense
	
Despite being past the mandatory retirement age of 60, this fair one attached to a certain regulatory commission still looks attractive enough to draw a second look from any grown-up normal male, they say. What makes this story is that a powerful secretary to a very high political authority going beyond bestowing a second look on this voluptuous lady has gone out of his way to authorize a service extension to her and an acting pay package as a bonus in addition to the normal salary.
By the way, this lady had doubled as the private secretary to both the ex-officio chairman and the director general of the regulatory commission during the previous regime thanks to the patronage of a powerful secretary at that time.
The new Director General of the regulatory commission had reportedly walked out of the board meeting held last week to protest against granting a service extension to the comely one when a lady appointed as his private secretary had already assumed duties.
However, the Director Generals newly appointed private secretary has now been shifted to the institutions reserve pool, they say.
