Lanka Hospitals denies H1N1 rumours
	
Lanka Hospital authorities today categorically rejected rumours circulating on social media websites that Maldivian patients diagnosed with swine flu had been admitted to the hospital and that several of them had died.
Group Chief Executive Officer Dr. Prasad Medawatte said only 12 Maldivian were currently undergoing treatment -- 10 were surgical operations and two were for general medical care but there were none admitted with symptoms of swine flu.
He said the rumours were baseless, malicious and defamatory aimed at tarnishing the image of the hospital.
Dr. Medawatte said Lanka Hospitals was continuing to serve its patients without any disruption.

MS Dhoni rescued safely from hotel fire in Dwarka, Delhi
	
Former India cricket captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni was this morning safely rescued from a fire in a hotel in Delhi's Dwarka neighbourhood.
No casualties were reported in the fire, Delhi Fire Services said. They added that they got a call around 6:30am alerting them there was a fire inside the WelcomHotel, which is located in Sector 10, Dwarka. As many as 30 fire tenders were sent to the spot and the fire was brought under control at 7:50am.
Dhoni was in the Capital with his Jharkhand team to play in the Vijay Hazare Trophy semi-final. The team's kit has apparently been reduced to ashes and consequentially the match has been postponed for tomorrow.
The Dhoni-led Jharkhand team entered the semifinals of the Vijay Hazare Trophy after outplaying Vidarbha by six wickets at the Palam Ground here on Wednesday, PTI reported.
Besides being Jharkhand's unofficial mentor in the Ranji Trophy, Dhoni has been an active member of the Vijay Hazare squad, captaining the side in all the six matches so far. His participation in the tournament has been attracting sizeable crowds wherever Jharkhand, PTI reported.
These matches were being seen as Dhoni's last competitive games in the 50-over format ahead of the Champions Trophy in June, a tournament seen as an important one for the former India captain, who now plays only as a wicket-keeper batsman in the national side.

I learnt today that there are three Ministers from this electorate looking after the fisheries sector. One is Mr. Amaraweera, and other State Minister Dilip Wedarachchi. The third one is provincial fisheries minister H.W. Gunaseana. All are from the same electorate. So, I thought of making some changes in the Cabinet portfolio, he said. (Sanath Gamage)

Senate intelligence panel rejects Trump wiretap claim
	
There are "no indications" that Trump Tower was under surveillance by the US government before or after the election, a Senate committee has said, the BBC News reported today.
The statement from Republican Senator Richard Burr, Senate Intelligence Committee chairman, dismissed US President Donald Trumps claim that his phones were tapped.
President Trump had accused his predecessor Barack Obama of wiretapping Trump Tower during the presidential race. However, White House Spokesman Sean Spicer said President Trump maintains his claims. "He stands by it," Mr. Spicer said at a daily news briefing on Thursday.
The press secretary refused to accept the Senate Intelligence Committee report, saying "they're not findings".
Mr. Spicer quoted at length from an unproven Fox News report suggesting former president Obama had dodged US restrictions by asking Britain's GCHQ electronic surveillance agency to monitor President Trump, an allegation already dismissed as "utterly ridiculous" by the Cheltenham-based complex.
Mr. Burr joins a cadre of Republican lawmakers who have rejected the allegation. "Based on the information available to us, we see no indications that Trump Tower was the subject of surveillance by any element of the United States government either before or after Election Day 2016" Mr. Burr said in a joint statement with Senator Mark Warner, the committee's vice-chairman.
Earlier on Thursday, House Speaker Paul Ryan also said "no such wiretap existed".
Republican chairman of the House intelligence committee Devin Nunes said on Wednesday he doesn't believe "there was an actual tap of Trump Tower".
But that has not deterred President Trump, who on Wednesday told Fox News a "wiretap covers a lot of different things". He also hinted that more details about the alleged surveillance could be revealed in the coming weeks.
"Wiretap covers a lot of different things. I think you're going to find some very interesting items coming to the forefront over the next two weeks," he said in an interview broadcast on Wednesday night.

Ukranian Captain's FR petition: SC grants leave to proceed
	
The Supreme Court Bench comprising Justices Eva Wanasundera and Nalin Perera today granted leave to proceed with the fundamental rights petition filed by MV Avant Garde's Ukrainian Captain challenging his arrest and detention.
Court fixed April 4 to consider interim relief and fix the date of the hearing.
Petitioner 49-year-old Gennadiy Gavrylov said he was arrested in October 2015 outside Sri Lankan territorial waters and was being detained at the Galle remand prison.
He said he had no political affiliations to any group or political party in Sri Lanka and that by some misfortune had been embroiled in a political tug-o-war prevailing in the country.
The petitioner cited the CID OIC, CID Director, CID DIG and Rakna Arakshaka Lanka Limited (RALL), a government-owned business undertaking affiliated to the Defence Ministry, Avant Garde Maritime Services (AGMS), Sri Lanka Shipping Company Limited, Lanka Maritime Services Limited, the Defence Secretary and the Attorney General as respondents.
He said the MV Avant Garde was chartered by Avant Garde Maritime Services belonging to Sri Lanka Shipping Company and was seized while in international waters in the wake of the change of government in Sri Lanka.
The petitioner said some of the respondents subjected him to cruel, inhumane and degrading treatment through falsely accusing him of entering Sri Lankan territorial waters in the vessel which he took over as captain on July 24, 2015. (S.S. Selvanayagam)

At a media briefing soon after the release came to be confirmed, Dr. de Silva thanked diplomats of various countries, especially the US, naval officers and institutions which supported the Sri Lankan government during time of need.
He said the American Embassy had helped the SL Government get in touch with Puntland President'sChief of Staff Abdinasir Sofe, who in turn had ordered the countrys navy to stop shooting at the ship and move aside to allow discussions between the pirates and the owners of the vessel.
This is a semi-autonomous region that we have no diplomatic ties with. We were grateful to have come in contact with the President, who had authority over the navy which was shooting in the general direction of the vessel, Dr. de Silva said.
He said the Puntland Navy was not firing at the ship but at the logistical boats in the vicinity. We are not sure what prompted them to do so, but we are grateful for the results of the discussions we had with the President's Chief of Staff, Abdinasir Sofe, Dr. de Silva said.
The ship and its crew were now safely on its way to Bossoa, the commercial capital of Puntland, where the crew would be treated for injuries and sent on their way.
When questioned about when the crew would arrive in the country, he said he was unsure of the crews future plans. We have done everything necessary as a government. It is the decision of the crew and the owners of the vessel as to what they will do now. We will of course intervene if the crew has issues applying for visas to return home, Dr. de Silva said and added that he was kept appraised of the situation on the Whatsapp messenger service. Messages exchanged with the President of Puntland prior to the news briefing ensured the safety and release of the crew.
General Operations Director Dharmendra Weetawa, who was also present at the briefing said, the situation led the Navy to appoint a permanent representative at the Combined Naval Forces Headquarters.
It was they who provided surveillance during the situation and provided updates every three hours, of the situation on-board the vessel. We have officers stationed there for various reasons, but we have decided to appoint a representative for Sri Lanka as we have the need for it now, he said.
Naval relations in the area was not fully developed in the area, but the Navy had received necessary backing in the time of need. Rear Admiral Wettawa said the owners of the vessel had not taken the necessary precautions when sailing in such dangerous seas.

Kurunegala District UNP MP Thushara Indunil lamented that the confrontational politics within the coalition government was causing him frustration.
He made these observations at a Kurunegala District convention of the March 12th Movement. He said that there were doubts being created among the people about the activities of the government and that people were asking whether the government was nabbing the rogues or whether the rogues were nabbing the government.
He said that he was the only MP who attended the convention. He said he felt frustrated as he had striven so hard towards the victory of President Maithripala Sirisena, but been overlooked when ministerial portfolios were being handed out. He said three persons from Kurunegala who had worked against Mr. Sirisena at the presidential election were now ministers.
He said that he was surprised that the university students had not protested against SAITM during the time of the previous administration. He said that when he asked the students about this they had said it was because they were afraid of Gotabaya Rajapaksa.
He said politicians had become so corrupt that people had begun to realise their mistake in voting for them. He added that the coalition government was unable to go forward as there were conflicting views and agreement was not possible. (Pushpakumar Jayarathne)
