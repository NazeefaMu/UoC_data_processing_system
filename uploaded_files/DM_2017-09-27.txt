Archaeology has enhanced the value of Sri Lankas tourism
	
World Tourism day is celebrated on September 27 every year. In 1979 United Nations World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) in its third session (Terremolinos, Spain, September 1979) decided to establish World Tourism Day. This is a very important milestone in the tourism sector. 

The main objective of this day is to make people aware of the tourism industry and observe its impact on every field in the society such as culture, economy and religion. And this is a very good opportunity to reveal how tourism caters and serves people in the world for their well being. 
Last year alone,1.235 mn travellers crossed international borders
	Tourism generates close to12% of world GDP

The Secretory General of the World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) Taleb Rifari in his official message states, Tourism is today the 3rd largest export industry in the world after chemicals and fuels. It brings hope, prosperity and understanding to so many lives and livelihoods all over the world. 

Last year alone, 1.235 million travellers crossed international borders, which is significant given that this was achieved in one single year. By 2030 this figure is expected to reach 1.8 billion. 

The question posed, as we celebrate World Tourism Day 2017, is how we can enable this powerful global transformative force-these 1.8 billion opportunities- make this world a better place and to advance sustainable development in all its five (5) pillars.

1.Economic: Yielding inclusive growth 
2. Social: Bringing decent jobs and empowering communities 
3. Environmental: Preserving and enriching the environmental and climate change 
4.Cultural: Celebrating and preserving diversity, identify and tangible and intangible culture 
5. Peace: As an essential perquisite for development and progress.  

The UN General Assembly declared 2017 as the International Year of Tourism for Development. 

This is a unique opportunity for all of us to come together to promote travel as a contributor to tourism. This should be done as a grand 21st Century human activity, to build a better future for people, the planet, peace and prosperity.  

According to the World Tourism Organization (UNWTO), tourist is defined as the temporary, short term movement of people to destinations outside the places where they normally live and work, and their activities during the stay at these destinations. It is also defined as the sum of the phenomena and relationship arising from the travel and stay of non residents, in so far as they dont lead to permanent residence and arent connected with any earning activity  (Hunziker and KrapF; 1941) 

When considering archeology there are many definitions. According to Glyn Daniel, Archeology is a subject where revealing mans history depends on the material evidence (Artifacts, monuments). Moreover, at present, most of the eminent archeologists agreed that archeology is a science which studies ancestors behavior, there material culture and their environment. 

According to the World Tourism Organization (UNWTO), tourist is defined as the temporary, short term movement of people to destinations outside the places where they normally live and work, and their activities during the stay at these destinations.

It is a well-known fact that for a long period of time Sri Lanka has been a place of attraction for tourists from all parts of the world. Especially it is very popular for the Ptolemis map of Sri Lanka and the visiting of Arabic trading community. Sri Lanka was named as serandib. And there is also Fahiens visit (5th century AD) to Sri Lanka giving some of the examples for Sri Lanka being on the map of tourism for a many centuries. 

There are literary and clear archeological evidences to prove that trading was in operation in ancient Sri Lanka. 

One of the ancient chronicles of India  Divyavadanaya  (5-6 century BC) mentioned about trade activities in ancient Sri Lanka. A Brahmi inscription, found at Duwegala in Polonnaruwa, has a picture of a sailing ship. Another Brahmi inscription at Bowattegala reveals the offering of a cave for the use of the Sanga (priests) by members of one of the foreign (Kaboja) trading companies. A trilingual inscription found in Galle (Chinese, Persian and Tamil (15th century AD) one C.W.Codrington has written that Roman coins were found along the coastal boarder of the southern province around Balapitiya. The records of H.C.P. Bell revealed that a fair number of Roman coins was found from the river bed of the Madu ganga. Quite a large number of Roman coins was found recently at Baragama in Hambantota District. Again there were many Chinese pottery found in various ancient ports and inland parts of Sri Lanka. According to the above examples it is very clear that people of various countries were aware of Sri Lankas trading activities. 
The historical identity of a country is enhanced by its archeological heritage. One must consider not only the above mentioned artifacts, but also the monuments as well. There are already two thousand five hundred monuments in Sri Lanka. There are some monuments found from archeological explorations done by the Department of Archeology in the Northern and Eastern Provinces after the thirty-year civil war. 

Because of the rich archeological sites and monuments UNESCO listed Eight world heritage sites in Sri Lanka. Six out of the eight are in Anuradhapura, Polonnaruwa, Sigiriya, Dambulla, Kandy and Galle Fort. The other two are Sinharaja and Horton Plains given their significant environmental values. 

Tourism is arguably the largest industry in the world generating 250 million jobs and contributing close to 12% of world GDP. Within this tourism sector, Cultural Tourism is one of the fastest expanding segments. 

Furthermore, it has become clear over the last few years that it is the developing world which takes an increasingly large portion of this expansion. Increasingly developing countries will feel the impact of tourism. As practiced by various countries in the world archaeological heritage could be launched as one of the main assets of Sri Lanka as well. 

In this process the Department of Archeology, Central Cultural Fund, National Museum and allied other institutions, Ministry of Tourism and relevant other institutions and experts of the industry have to play a vital role. A combined operation should be introduced and promoted in collaboration with these authorities.

Biding time to stage a bigger show!
	
The Amendment allegedly designed as a ruse to postpone the provincial polls raised much sound and fury and finally ended as a damp squib.
According to informed sources the names of four prominent figures on the government side had been mentioned in the lobby talk as among those who had vowed to vote against the Amendment if it were presented in the council. Three of this foursome made a major contribution towards the effort to usher in the yahapalanaya government. One of them is a minority community leader representing a distant part in the country. The other two hailing from the Colombo district are conspicuous by their nationalist fervor. The fourth one is from the Gampaha district. Meanwhile, three others had pledged their support to the rebellious foursome.
Although the circumstances intervened to preempt their big move, the foursome had decided to take yahapalanaya by surprise in a bigger way in the immediate future, sources say.

CCTV cameras to install in selected prisons
	
The Ministry of Prisons is to commence installing CCTV camera surveillance systems in selected prisons next week to ramp up security, a top ministry official said today.
Full HD (high-definition) cameras will be installed at prisons in Welikada, Angunakolapelessa, Pallekele, Mahara and Negombo.
The project will be initially implemented at the recently constructed Super Prison in Angunakolapelessa, and is scheduled to be completed within an year.
Most jails already have cameras set up at the entrance and we are looking at including the inside of the prison as well. The move is a part of a long-pending plan to minimize malpractice inside, the official said.
According to prison authorities cell phone jammers were also set up in a few prisons but the project had not received the expected outcome.
Meanwhile, the ministry official said that some inmates from the Welikada prison will be transferred to Angunakolapelessa once it is open due to overcrowding. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

First mosque tour in Kandy a success
	
The First Ever Open Mosque Day in Kandy took place on September 20 at the historic Meera Makam Mosque. The event, organised by the Centre for Islamic Studies (CIS) in association with the trustees of Meera Makam Mosque was an immense success with over 300 persons of other faiths participating. 
Asiff Hussein, Vice President, Outreach, CIS said that the Open Mosque event- the first of its kind in Kandy- had attracted clergy of different faiths, Government officials, police officers, teachers and students. Besides a tour of the historic Meera Makam Mosque and Islamic prayer demonstrations, visitors were taken around a walk-through of posters clearing misconceptions of Islam and presented with beautiful Arabic calligraphy of their names, traditional Muslim foods and gift packs containing literature and perfume. A special henna corner for the ladies was also a major draw. 
We plan to have similar events in other mosques all over the country in the near future spearheaded by our outreach team mainly drawn from our Youth Wing said Hussein. We have had such events at Akbar Mosque on Kew Road in Colombo, which were also very popular. A noteworthy feature of the Kandy program was the active participation of Mosque Tour Guides from among the learned scholars of the All Ceylon Jamiyyathul Ulama, the countrys apex Islamic body. This shows the wide acceptance of the concept of mosque tours as a means of building bridges with other communities he added.

Fmr Thai PM found guilty, sentenced to prison
	
Thailand's Supreme Court has sentenced former prime minister Yingluck Shinawatra to five years' jail after finding her guilty of negligence over a rice subsidy scheme her government set up to help farmers.
Nine judges were still delivering the verdict on Wednesday when news of the sentence leaked to Thai media.
The sentence will anger millions of supporters in Yingluck's "Red-Shirt" movement ahead of elections promised next year by the military that staged a coup to topple her democratically elected government after months of political unrest in 2014.
Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, a former army general who led the coup, said on Tuesday he knew where Yingluck was hiding but refused to divulge where until after Wednesday's hearing.
"I have my own spies. I have information but I can't say it out aloud," he said, adding she had not sought asylum in another country.
Yingluck dramatically fled the country a month ago. Three senior policemen have been investigated but not charged for allegedly helpingher escape to the Cambodian border in a car with counterfeit plates.
Yingluck, who was previously active on social media, has made no public comment since leaving Thailand.
Thailand's Supreme Court has sentenced former prime minister Yingluck Shinawatra to five years' jail after finding her guilty of negligence over a rice subsidy scheme her government set up to help farmers.
Mr Prayuth urged Thais to remain calm over the case which appears to have finally crushed the Shinawatra family whose movement won the last five general elections, making it the most dominant force in Thai politics for more than a decade.
"No-one should be alarmed," Mr Prayuth said.
Under the rice scheme Yingluck's government bought rice from farmers at above-market prices in an attempt to manipulate the global grain market.
The program collapsed as neighbouring countries increased production and stockpiles of rice rotted in Thai warehouses.
The military government said losses amounted to $US8 billion ($10 billion).
Only about 75 of Yingluck's supporters turned up at the court on Wednesday compared to thousands who risked arrest to show their support at earlier court hearings.
Yingluck and Thaksin claim they are victims of a witch-hunt by Bangkok's military, royalists, middle class and elite establishment.
Thaksin, a billionaire businessman who enemies accuse of being corrupt, has compared the Thai military government to tyrants.
Yingluck's trial was seen as a showcase for Thailand's national divide, which looks increasingly irreconcilable.
Prosecutors alleged Yingluck's government ignored numerous written warnings from the auditor-general and the country's anti-corruption commission about the rice program's risks and irregularities.
But no corruption allegations were levelled against her in the case.
Yingluck earlier told the court she did not terminate the program because it was never intended to generate revenue but to raise the incomes of farmers, and she forwarded the warnings to relevant government agencies.
A subsequent investigation found no irregularities, she said.
Even before the trial, authorities hit Yingluck with a $US1 billion fine over the program and seized her 16 bank accounts.
Other former governments have implemented similar popular rice subsidy schemes but none collapsed at a cost of billions of dollars.
A former commerce minister in Yingluck's government was jailed for 42 years in August for falsifying government-to-government rice deals in connection with the scheme.(BBC)

Follow advice of Maha Nayakas: Amarapura Maha Nayaka
	
Rulers of the nation should follow the advice of the Maha Nayaka Theras and the Maha Sanga as a whole when running the country, Most Venerable Mahanayaka Thera of Amarapura Nakaya Kotugoda Dhammawasa Thera said today.
Ven. Mahanayaka Thera came up with this remark during his anusasana at a Sangika Dhana held at the Temple Trees for thousand monks in order to invoke blessings on the country last afternoon.
The country should be run with the advice of the Maha Sanga including the most Venerable Maha Nayaka Theras. The advice which the Mahanayaka Theras and the Buddhist clergy provide are based on the Dhamma preached by Buddha. Even the late leaders such as D. S. Senanayake ran the country following the advice of the Maha Sangha.
Most Ven. Dhammawasa Thera said rulers of a country have to follow five principles according to the teachings of the Buddha. President, Prime Minister and other ministers should provide clean water, sanitary facilities, fulfil housing needs of the people and preserve the environment as preached by the Buddha. We request that rulers of this country should follow these principles, he added.
The Mahanayake of Kotte, Sri Kalyani Samagri Dharma Maha Sangha Sabha of Siyam Maha Nikaya, Most Venerable Ittapane Dhammalankara Thera said only the Maha Nayaka Theras have the right to advice monks on participating in Dhannas and other functions. Certain MPs have advised the monks not to participate in this Dhanna and religious programmes today. However, it should be noted that laymen do not have the right to advise the monks, he said.
Anu Nayaka of the Malwathu Chapter Venerable Niyangoda Wijithasiri Thera said he himself and other monks decided to participate in the Dhana and the other religious programmes at Temple Trees following the advice of Maha Nayaka Theras. (Yohan Perera)

Mangala condemns attack on Rohingyas
	
Finance and Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera today condemned the attack against the Rohingya refugees by a group of protesters in Mt. Lavinia on Tuesday.
In a video statement, the minister said he condemned the attack in the strongest possible terms.
I condemn in the strongest possible terms the attack against the Rohingya refugees who were under the care of the UNHRC in Mt. Lavinia by a group of 'thugs in robes'. In fact, I condemn these actions not only as the Minister in charge of Media but also condemn as a Buddhist, a Buddhist who is very proud the fact that Buddhism is a religion of non-violence and compassion, he said.
He said the group of refugees, 30 of them from Myanmar, were rescued at sea by the Sri Lankan Navy in April this year and they were under the care of the UNHRC waiting to be resettled elsewhere in the US or Canada.
In fact this is not the first time Sri Lanka has given temporarily shelter to such refugees. Way back in March 2008, the Navy rescued survivors of a boat after they were found adrift in the high seas. They were kept here until 2012 the year they were resettled in the US, he said.
The minister said in a separate incident in 2013, the navy rescued two boat loads of Rohingya survivors from a shipwreck in the Eastern coast of Sri Lanka.
Thirty two of these refugees were kept under the care of the UNHRC until they were settled in the US and Canada, he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Maximum price for tea, lunch packet, hoppers
	
All Island Restaurant Owners Association (AIROA) today requested the Consumer Affairs Authority (CAA) to declare the maximum retail prices of a cup of tea, a packet of lunch, a hopper and a cup of milk tea.
Speaking to the Daily Mirror AIROA, earlier known as Canteen Owners Association National Organiser of Associations Chairman Asela Sampath said the decision was taken following a meeting held yesterday.
The maximum retail price was increased in the wake of the price of a domestic LP gas cylinder going up by Rs.110 and increase of essential food items.
Most of the restaurant owners use LP gas and therefore it is very essential to increase the price of food items, he said.
Accordingly, the price of a cup of tea would be increased to Rs.20 while the price of a cup of Milk Tea will be increased to Rs 40.
The price of a packet of lunch (fish) would be increased to Rs. 130 and the price of a hopper will be increased to Rs. 15.
The price of lunch packets should be increased and lunch packets should be gazetted as an essential food item.
Lunch packets should be named an essential food item by the Consumer Affairs Authority (CAA) and should have a controlled price. That control price should be revised according to the price of related items, Mr. Sampath said.
He said a lunch packet should have a minimum standard and it should include three vegetables, a piece of fish and greens.
The government should be held responsible for the inconvenience of the public. (Chaturanga Pradeep)

Nekata set, but players not ready for action!
	
A purohita at state level from among the dissidents had spent the last several weeks going from one astrologer to another in a bid to fix a one hundred percent perfect nekata  auspicious time  to stage their crossover to the opposition.
This purohita, a diehard loyalist of the former strongman had later informed the dissident group of the nekata fixed for a day in the third week of the current month.
Later armed with the nekata and a sensational statement to be made prior to staging the collective crossover, he had met the group leaders and much to his surprise and disappointment they had told him to be patient for a while.
Given the indecision and foot-dragging on the part of the leaders of the dissident group, some observers say that the state purohita has already become a maverick and if he decides to stick to the nekata he got painstakingly ordained, his crossover would be a one-man show in the council.
However, the state purohita is reportedly telling all and sundry making inquiries from him, that at least two or three would join him in crossing the floor with him come the big day given the potency of the nekata.

Pindapatha stopped, money to be used for welfare work
	
The joint opposition sponsored Pindapatha programme was suspended after former presidential secretary Lalith Weeratunga and Anusha Palpita the former director general of the Telecommunications Regulatory Commission (TRC) had refused to accept money collected in this manner, Ven. Medagoda Abhyatissa Thera said today.
Several monks went on Pindapata in Colombo and Kiribathgoda for the purpose of collecting money to pay the fines imposed on the two convicts found guilty of misappropriating Rs.600 million belonging to the TRC and using it to distribute 'sil redi' in support of former president Mahinda Rajapaksa.
The Thera said Mr. Weeratunga and Mr. Palpita had requested that the monies collected so far be used for some welfare work.
So we decided to use whatever was collected to build a house for a war hero who will be selected during the next few weeks. We will not waste even a cent because the monies were offered by our devotees, he said.
When asked about the exact amount collected during the two days, JO MPs Sisira Jayakody, Bandula Gunawardane and Gamini Lokuge said the Thera was handling the monies as the Treasurer and that only he knew about the amount collected.
Meanwhile, the Thera said the monies collected was yet to be counted.
Earlier, the JO claimed that close to Rs.1 million had been collected during the Pindapata held in Colombo with the participation of more than 300 Buddhist monks.(Piyumi Fonseka)

Pothas 'sick and tired' of transition talk
	
Ahead of the Test series against Pakistan, Sri Lanka interim coach Nic Pothas has said that he and his team are "sick and tired" of talking about them being in transition.
Sri Lanka will be hoping to turn their fortunes around when they start a two-match Test series against Pakistan in Abu Dhabi on Thursday.
Pothas, who is standing in as Sri Lanka coach since Graham Ford quit the job in June, oversaw an ODI series loss against Zimbabwe at home and then lost every single game against India also on home soil, which included three Tests, five ODIs and a T20I.
Part of the problems that face Sri Lanka cricket is that they have not yet replaced the runs and experience of legends such as Kumar Sangakkara and Mahela Jayawardene.
However, the last of those retirements came more than two years ago and Pothas has urged the players to move on with their performances on the field.
Pothas said: "We are probably in an era where we are sick and tired of talking about transition. Sick and tired of about talking about it as a 'learning period'.
"It is time to go out and perform, and that is the challenge. You are going to meet a world-class team. We have to move forward."
Pothas will hoping for a resurgence from his team against Pakistan with the second Test of the series to be played in Dubai from October 6 while the teams will also contest five ODIs and three T20Is.

Rohingyas should be expelled: SNF
	
An organization named Sinhalese National Force (SNF) today claimed that the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) was intervening into matters related to the states sovereignty by allowing the accommodation of Rohingya refugees in Sri Lanka.
Holding a demonstration in Colombo against the accommodation of Rohingya refugees, the SNF urged the United Nations (UN) to take immediate actions to expel the Rohingya refugees of Myanmar from the country.
There is a threat from these Rohingya Muslim refugees to our countrys sovereignty. That shows that the UNHRC is more powerful than the law in our country.
Meanwhile, SNF General Secretary Arambepola Rathana Thera handed over a Sandeshaya to a UN official saying the detained Rohingya refugees should be expelled from the country.
The Government and the Defense Ministry were in two sides and as a result the Rohingya refugees are staying in the country. The issue of Rohingya Muslims is a related to Myanmar and they were expelled from Myanmar because of an internal problem there.
Myanmar Muslim militants had reportedly attacked eighteen Police stations, an Army camp in their country. They have allegedly killed civilians and Buddhist monks in Myanmar. They had run away because of fear to facing the political and civil issues in Myanmar. They are actually a kind of terrorists, the Thera said.
According to the law of the country, we are not bound to provide shelter for refugees. For letting them to stay, the country risks deadly terrorists sneaking in.
Six children of those refugees are attending schools in our country but they have been in our country for two months. They have come to Sri Lanka violating the immigration and emigration laws. Even they did not have a citizenship in Myanmar.
If those Rohingya Muslims used to spread terrorism in the country or if someone in our country gets killed by them, how do we take legal actions against them
They do not have a valid identity. It was reported that one baby was born at the Castle Street Hospital for Women in Colombo. There is an issue of providing a birth certificate to that new born child.
Our country is not a slave island for refugees. We pay taxes to the Government. The Government is bound to provide us protection. Instead of justifying the protection of the country, the Government and the Police is proving shelter for terrorists, while putting the national security in danger, Rathana Thera said.
The Government lied to people and mislead them on Rohingya Muslims refugee issue. The responsibility of those Muslim refugees had been taken by the UNHRC.
The UNHRC is interfering in the countrys sovereignty. There is a threat from these Rohingya Muslims refugee to our countrys sovereignty. That shows that the UNHRC is more power full than the law in our country.
Therefore we have gathered in front of the UN office in Colombo and informed them the real situation that our country is facing, he said. (Chaturanga Pradeep)

Seeking divine power at his unhappy hour
	
A purohita at the centre of the raging controversy over the upcoming petty polls is in a melancholy mood these says, they say.
The reason for this mood is the impression he has got that he is being cold-shouldered by Number One. Those close to the purohita say that the Big Boss would not even care to answer his phone calls.
This purohita who is used to hob-nob with high and mighty is said to be highly cut up over the apparent change of attitude on the part of the Big Boss with whom he got quite pally on the eve of the last
big poll.
Some say the Big Boss has kept the purohita at arms length ever since learning about a questionable business venture the purohita is said to be involved in. Stories about similar involvements of this purohita had gone viral even in the days of the previous regime, they say.
He had even sought without success a meeting with the Big Boss to discuss the upcoming petty polls.
The purohita is planning these days to visit a shrine in the mid-east to seek divine intervention for a quick solution to his problem, they say.

Steals the show with his new hairstyle
	
There is a senior purohita in yahapalanaya hailing from an area of Wellassa fame. The electorate he nursed for decades rejected him at the last general polls. However, he could muster enough manape to make it to Diyawanna.
This fast aging purohita with a penchant to look young created a mild stir in the council the other day when he appeared sporting a new hair style which, of course, made him look years younger!
The first one in the council to compliment the new look- purohita was the irresistible red party leader Anu. O! a fine hairdo! he exclaimed. The purohitas JO colleagues were the next to express their pleasant surprise. Fine! Lovely! Maru! Shok! were the complimentary epithets they used. 
Meanwhile, some members who appeared to have had given sober thought to the purohitas new hairstyle said that the purohita was only wearing a wig on advice given by a lovely one from the medical profession. Several others claimed that the new hairstyle has something to do with his recent visit to Tirupati Kovil in South India.

Visiting Geneva for 3rd time in eight months
	
A high level secretarial one appointed only eight months ago is said to be packing his bags to leave for Geneva for the third time in a row.
What is worse is that this secretarial one had ignored his political boss order to send the white collar one conversant with the subject to the Geneva conference this time round.
By the way, the purohita in charge of the Ministry had decided to resign himself to the antics of his secretarial one as he (the latter) is an appointee of an authority at the highest level, they say.
