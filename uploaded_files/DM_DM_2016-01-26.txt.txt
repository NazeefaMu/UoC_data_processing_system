A new political party in the making
	
A small group of political big guns had recently held a secret conference at the residential premises of a certain Devalaya.
A former political leader, his sibling and two Diyawanna members from the Colombo district had attended this conference.
At this conference, the sibling of the former political leader had briefed the others on the steps being taken on forming a new political party.
It had also transpired during the discussion that several Green party stalwarts and a group of Red party organisers led by that partys former leader were expected to join the new political party.

A party leader in a blind alley
	
The recent resignation of the sibling of the Tree party leader from his Diyawanna seat had come as a bolt from the blue for many in political circles. This sibling, of course, had made his way to Diyawanna thanks to the national list quota reserved for the Tree party.
In fact, it was the partys chief secretarial one of Ali fame who had been eyeing this slot on the national list. However, there had been formidable objections from powerful sections in the party to nominating the secretarial one for this slot and the party leader finally nominated his sibling as a half way-house choice, they say.
The tug-o-war had had not ended following the nomination of the sibling. For party stalwarts from the East, the power base of the party, had continued insisting either the legal one of Kariya fame or the secretarial one of Ali fame from the East be sent to Diyawanna.
So the Tree party leader in a bid to put off those breathing down his neck had asked his sibling to step down, they say.
Meanwhile, there is talk that another national list member of the party is about to resign. However, no matter who is appointed to fill the existing vacancy or the vacancy likely to fall vacant, the issue will continue to plague the Tree party leader, they say.

While stressing that it is a timely need to have the Bhikku Kathikawath Bill, Asgiriya Chapter Mahanayake Ven. Galagama Sri Aththadassi Thera said there was a misconception in the society about the bill due to some of its contents.
We feel the problematic situation has arisen because some of the content that should be included in each Kathikawatha of the chapters, had been included in this bill, the Mahanayake Thera said in a statement.
The Thera also said bill is the result of the request by the Maha Sangha led by the Mahanayakes of the three-chapters from the government.
There is a problematic situation in society because of the way the media reported it. This is not an act of the government to impose rules and regulations on the Bhikkus, but a bill to register in each chapter, the statement said.
However, the statement said the Karaka Sabha of the Asgiriya Chapter would further study the bill and submit their views to the government.

Circuit bungalow turns a haunt for honeymooning VIPs
	
There is a certain yahapalanaya purohita who frequents a circuit bungalow in the South run by an important state establishment.
However, this worthy does not visit the circuit bungalow all alone. Some fair and lovely socialite or other would invariably be his companion whenever he comes here. Quite recently the purohita had berated the bungalow manager for not furnishing the rooms at the bungalow with drapery to ensure adequate privacy.
A few days ago, the purohita arrived at the bungalow along with a famous film actress no longer in the firmament. By the way, she is now doing well as a businessperson, they say. Another day he had come with a lady from a well-known political family in tow. On yet another occasion his companion had been a comely lady holding a high position in an institution under his Ministry. This bungalow is fast becoming a haunt for honeymooning VIPs, they say. By the way, a bungalow employee had recently got the chop for not being discreet about the goings-on in this place.

Nasheed seeks SL, Indian influence to return
	
Former President of the Maldives Mohamed Nasheed, who is in the UK for medical care, had said the date of his return was uncertain and that he might seek to exert influence from Sri Lanka or India to return, the Sydney Morning Herald reported.
Holding a meeting with his lawyer Amal Clooney and British Prime Minister David Cameron on Monday to call for sanctions against the Maldivian government, Mr. Nasheed said the date of my return is in a "fluid situation" and I might seek to exert influence from India or Sri Lanka or could return to jail. However, I will definitely go to the Maldives. But the only question is how and when.
Nasheed, the Maldives' first democratically elected president, was jailed for 13 years on terrorism charges last March after a rapid trial that drew international condemnation. He was granted permission to leave the Indian Ocean island for 30 days to travel to London for treatment for his back.
In his first comments since being released, he indicated he would not return before that deadline and called on the international community to impose sanctions against those responsible for human rights abuses in the Maldives.
"Sanctions imposed can easily be rolled back. But unless they are imposed, President [Abdullah] Yameen will have no incentive to take further action," Nasheed said.
Nasheed, who in 2009 held a cabinet meeting underwater to highlight the threat of climate change to the low-lying Indian Ocean island, was ousted in disputed circumstances in 2012 for ordering the arrest of a judge. The United Nations, the United States and human rights groups have said Yameen's government failed to follow due process and that the case was politically motivated.
Nasheed's lawyer Amal Clooney said only the threat of action led to the former president's release, while Ben Emmerson, another member of Nasheed's legal team, said the Maldives had now become a "hotbed of fundamentalism and terrorism".
He said it was estimated that more than 200 people from the Maldives had joined the militant group Islamic State, the highest number per capita of any state in the world.
"It is only a question of time before the Maldives witnesses an incident comparable to the tragedy that occurred on the beaches of Tunisia last year," he said, referring to an attack on a beach hotel last July claimed by IS, in which 38 tourists, mainly British, were killed.
The Maldives Foreign Minister Dunya Maumoon said Nasheed had exploited his release and had been "disingenuous at best, and misleading at worst" about his medical condition.
"It is now clear his primary goal was to court publicity in the United Kingdom. This is not medical leave, but media leave," she said in a statement.
Nasheed said his medical condition was serious and he had suffered from a chronic back problem since being tortured in his 20s.

This is something hardly known to our people; there is a spa for the exclusive use of Diyawanna members where Ayurvedic massage services are provided. This spa which has been in existence for some time has become popular among the Diyawanna members only quite recently, they say.
A group of opposition members had occasion to discuss this Members Only spa when they met in the House lobby on the final day of the sittings last week.
Do you know who regularly visits this health parlor seeking massage services one member asked his colleagues.
No. We dont know. If you know, tell us, another member told him.
The member who launched the subject replied: According to a survey done by us, it is the Cabinet one  from the South who frequents this Ayurvedic health parlour. That handsome Deputy  from Colombo also often visits this place The Cabinet one from the South is, of course, trying his best to look young and dashing again! He had had a date with his masseur practically every evening when the House was sitting for about one month at a stretch  

Is there anything wrong with that another member asked.
There is nothing wrong with that, replied the member who revealed the results of the survey.

A former purohita with very high academic and professional qualifications was summoned the other day by a Police unit investigating corruptions of the bigwigs of the previous regime.
The purohita along with a Presidents Counsel appeared before the inquiring officer at the appointed time.
The young officer following the usual procedure asked the former purohita his name, occupation and his educational and professional qualifications. The former purohita gave all details in English. However, the young inquiring officer just looked on with a blank expression without putting his pen to the paper before him.
The former purohita addressed the young officer: I gave answers to all your questions. Why dont you take them down
Sir, the degrees you mentioned are quite strange to me. I am not proficient in English either. Can you please speak in Sinhala the young officer asked.
So the former purohita answered in Sinhala the questions put to him by the inquiring officer. Quizzing over, the officer handed the statement to the former purohita asking him to sign as having read over and found it correct.
The former purohita, one proficient both in English and Sinhala, told the inquiring officer: I cannot sign this statement, because there are numerous spelling and other grammatical errors making what I have said into misconstructions. Do you know that even an error relating to an ispilla, papilla, kombuwa or a dot can lead to a wrong legal interpretation
If that is the case, can you please, Sir, re-write the statement dropping all mistakes, the officer implored.
So the former purohita agreed to re-write the statement and it took several hours for him to finish the job. By that time pangs of hunger had begun assailing them all.

During the deliberations, the director pointed out that the development activity underway in the country was not getting sufficient publicity.
One of the participants who took exception to the directors remark said: You were saying the same thing in the days of the previous regime. You are parroting it under this regime too. Why on earth are you playing the same tune over and over again An altercation between the director and his challenger had ensued.

The new Big Boss had issued precise instructions that the celebrations to mark his first year in office should be simple and the expenses involved should be restricted to the minimum possible.
The organizers of the event first submitted to the new Big Boss an estimate for Rs.6 million for constructing the stage and other works involved and he had immediately pointed out that the estimate was too high.
The celebrations were held and every one said that the event was a big hit.
A few days later, a white collar bigwig of a key office had received a bill for all expenses incurred in connection with the ceremony. And he was stunned to find that the bill was for a whopping Rs.12 million. The official had immediately stopped payment and reported the matter to the Big Boss and the latter too had expressed his amazement.
An inquiry into the high costs incurred in connection with the celebrations was soon launched, they say.
It had transpired later that the contractor had billed even for services rendered by the armed force personnel.

Everyone is equal before the law and we will not allow Somaramas and Buddarakithas to emerge again," he said.

The Prime Minister said Sri Lanka should follow countries such as Singapore which had a considerable say in global affairs.
Sri Lanka too is becoming an important country in the World and that's why the Foreign Ministry played a role in bringing about stability in the Maldives," he said adding that the recent overseas visits of President Maithripala Sirisena were ample proof of this situation. (Yohan Perera)

Lankan health officials involved in Kidney racket: Report
	
Suresh Prajapathi, who was arrested by the Indian police after busting a kidney transplantation racket recently, has told his interrogators that gaps in the legal provisions helped him exploit the kidney donors and recipients, the Hindu reported.
Hailing from Ahmedabad, the racket mastermind made use of doctors in Ahmedabad and Sri Lanka to operate the racket by offering money to them.
As per the law in Sri Lanka, the kidney recipient must convince a three-member ethical committee of the hospital, where the surgery was to be performed, that the donor came forward voluntarily to give the organ. The committee comprises a member from that countrys Health Ministry and two doctors from local government hospital there.
Investigations by Nalgonda police indicated that the racketeers were paying 500 US dollars (nearly Rs. 33,000 in Indian currency) bribe to the ethical committee for giving permission to each kidney transplantation surgery. This comes to less than one per cent of the money being paid by the kidney recipient to Suresh, the investigators told The Hindu .
Many people were going to Sri Lanka for kidney transplantations since the law was not as strong as in India. Out of Rs. 30 lakh being paid to the conspirator by the recipient of kidney, nearly Rs. 15 lakh is given to the hospital management. While Rs. 5 lakh goes to the donor, an equal sum is taken by the conspirator. Travel expenses of the donors and bribe amounts to the ethical committee are borne out of the remaining sum.
A five to ten member team, sent by Suresh Prajapathi to Sri Lanka, roams around the offices and hospital to find the slots for kidney surgeries in the four hospitals involved in the racket. The team will provide accommodation to donor and recipient and will make travel arrangements.
Enactment of stringent law was the only solution to stop illegal kidney transplantations in Sri Lanka, the investigators felt.

The livewire behind the regrouping of these local politicos is a family member who is widely looked on as the main cause for the former strongmans downfall.  The key figures of the joint opposition who had been faithful companions of the former strongman on his political journey so far, are said to be highly upset over the family members comeback to the scene to direct the former strongmans political destiny.
The joint opposition bigwigs say that they stood by the former strongman at his darkest hour and now this family member who is not popular among his own kith and kin has come back to sideline them and send their political plans haywire.
They also have warned that the simmering anger among the Blue party men at the family members self-appointed role as the new party organizer will soon reach boiling point and therefore, the former strongman should lose no time in showing him the door.
