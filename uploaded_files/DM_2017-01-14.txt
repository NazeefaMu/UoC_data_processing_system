Beggars will ride on Ravi's resident visas: Wijeyadasa
	
Justice Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe yesterday criticized Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayakes statement that temporary resident visas would be issued to foreigners who invest a minimum of US$300,000 in Sri Lanka.
He said such a move would only make way for beggars to enter Sri Lanka and added that the statement was issued by the finance minister without consulting the Cabinet.
The finance minister has no right to take arbitrary decisions. Not even the President knows about this. We would have opposed such a proposal if it was submitted to the Cabinet, the justice minister said.
He said US$300,000 was equivalent to Rs.45 million which is the amount spent to buy a luxury vehicle or just two perches of land in Colombo. Providing privileges to foreigners who invest US$300,000 is absurd. We could encourage local investors, who are capable of investing Rs.45 million, instead. We have plenty of such investors in the country, the justice minister said.
He expressed concern that terrorists and drug peddlers could also make their way into the country, if temporary resident visas were granted to foreigners who invest a minimum of US$300,000 in Sri Lanka. This is a matter of serious concern, the justice minister said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Buddhist Monks  Protected  St. Joseph Vazs Historical Couch
	

The historical Couch-Palanquin believed to have been used by the late Rev. Fr. Joseph Vaz who was elevated to sainthood by Pope Francis during his visit to Sri Lanka in 2015 was displayed at St. Francis Xaviers Church in Gurugalla, Avissawella recently, where a large number of devotees from many parts of the island visited and venerated it.
He was born on April 21, 1651 in Benaulim, India and was ordained an Oratorian priest later. 
Fr. Joseph Vaz visited the island during the Dutch period when the Catholics of Sri Lanka were being subjected to persecution by the Dutch authorities. History records that these Catholics who lived mostly in the coastal areas fled to safety during these attacks. The Dutch were imposing Calvinism as the official religion after taking over from the Portuguese. He travelled throughout the island bringing the Eucharist and the sacraments to clandestine groups of Catholics. Later in his mission, he found shelter in the Kingdom of Kandy where he was able to work freely. By the time of his death, Vaz had managed to rebuild the Catholic Church in the island. 
He arrived in the island disguised as a beggar and mixed with the suffering and attended to their religious needs. Volumes were written on the mission of Fr. Joseph Vaz and he is hailed as champion of protecting the Catholic denomination, its rites and teachings. In his pursuit to protect the Catholics and their ardent faith in the face of severe oppression and harassment by the Dutch, Fr. Joseph Vaz moved from village to village, caring for devotees and nursing the sick. Folklore reveals that he had lived in Ruwanwella, Kegalle and Karawanella disguised as a beggar.  
Although born in India, Fr. Vaz is known as the Apostle of Ceylon. On 21, January 1995, he was beatified by Pope John Paul II in Colombo. He was canonized on January 14, 2015 by Pope Francis in an open-air mass ceremony at the Galle Face Green in Colombo. 
During the exposition of this historical Couch, the Parish Priest of St. Francis Xavier, Awissawella, Rev. Fr. Gratian Hapuarachchi said the couch was kept for several days in the church and that several Holy Masses and other rituals were held with the participation of a large number of devotees. These services were held under the patronage of the Bishop of Ratnapura, Rev. Dr. Cletus Chandrasiri. This couch, dating back to more than 400 years has now become an historical artefact. This exposition was made possible with the intervention of the Gurugalla Apelapitiya Sri Sudharmarama Viharadhipathi Ven. Dammarathana Thera and Maniyangama Raja Maha Viharadhipathi Ven. Abanwala Hemalankara Nayaka Thera. The couch was returned to the Raja Maha Viharaya where it has been kept for many years.
This priceless artifact which has a religious importance for Christians was preserved by the Ven. Monks at Maniyamgama Rajamahaviharaya and Rev. Fr. Hapuarachchi was grateful to the Buddhist monks for making it available for exhibition at the church. The Couch was preserved and protected because of the Ven. Monks and this is what we called religious harmony and coexistence, Fr. Hapuarachchi said. This is a valuable treasure belonged to the temple and after the exhibition and religious veneration we returned it to Rajamahaviharaya, he said.

The distribution of water in areas of Kurunegala has already been curtailed.
Meanwhile the WSDB has taken measures to supply water by bowsers in areas where water resources have been badly affected due to the drought. (Jayantha Samarakone)

Expansion of IT, a threat to employment: Minister Akila
	
The expansion of Information Technology (IT) has become a threat to a many employment opportunities today, Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam said.
Attending a ceremony to launch Cloud Smart Classroom programme at Sri Jayewardenepura Kotte Boys School, Pita Kotte, yesterday, he said that the growth in the fields of Information Technology (IT), Artificial Intelligence (AI) had made an impact on many professions.
In the near future, IT will rule the world. I believe excellence in IT education would solve the matters which we are facing today. If students have E-learning practice, they need not worry about their future. Traditional schooling methods no longer solve the issue of unemployment. 'Smart Cloud Classroom' would make you capable of almost anything, he said.
He said the world doesnt count on individuals' knowledge anymore because Google and other information resources are available now. We will guide you to find answers using IT. There is no need of storing study notes inside your head hereafter, the minister said.
Speaking at the event, Executive Director of Kojen, Dr. Harsha Subasinghe said that world renowned companies like Tesla automobile and Google are using Artificial Intelligence at the moment, in their products and services, which have led them to minimize their human efficiency.
Autonomous car (self-driving car/robotic car) was no longer a concept. Tesla has already built it. What would befall the future of the drivers and chauffeurs, hereafter, he questioned.
The 'Smart Cloud Classroom' was designed to create enriching learning experiences using information technology as an exception for books and other traditional learning methods. The practice is currently being used in countries like Korea, United States and the U.K.. The programme was launched as a Private-Public Partnership (PPP) with the support of the Kojen International Private Institution and the Central Bearing Company headed by Sudath Tennakoon, under the instructions of the Education Ministry.
The 'Smart Cloud Classroom' equipped with Tabs, furniture and other educational software, was handed over to the grade 3 students of Sri Jayewardenepura Kotte Boys School, Pitakotte.
Deputy Foreign Minister Dr. Harsha de Silva, School Principal Major D. A. D. Wanaguru, the Education Ministry Secretary Sunil Hettiarachchi, school teachers and students, participated at the event. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

Govt. to introduce economic agenda: PM
	
The Government will soon introduce its economic agenda for the next few years, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said yesterday.
He said this at a ceremony organized by the Ministry of Public Administration to distribute appointment letters to state sector management assistants at Temple Trees. The Prime Minister said the main objective of this economic agenda would be to convert Sri Lanka into a high income earning country by 2031.
He said the economic agenda would bring about reorganisation, and will be introduced with the consent of President Maithripala Sirisena. The Prime Minister said in 30 years from now none of the government offices would have any files because all data would be available either on the mobile phone or on a small machine such as a tab.
He said the cash board system which is now implemented in Andhra Pradesh India would be available in Sri Lanka as well, and enable anyone to view the income and expenditure of every government office through a mobile or a similar electronic device.
We will have to decide what the governments role would be and the functions to be performed by the government in partnership with the private sector. No development could be achieved if the government controls everything, he said.
The Prime Minister referred to the need for change in the rural economy. Many of the state workers are not from the town but from rural areas. We have to develop and modernize the agriculture sector. Government does not have sufficient funds to do it, and neither does the private sector. Therefore we need foreign investments," he said.
The Prime Minister said even China allowed foreign investors initially when its economy was opened up. China initially opened up its economy for foreign investors. Then the local entrepreneurs started emerging during the second decade. During the third decade the local entrepreneurs dominated the economic scene," he said adding that Sri Lanka should also implement the same system.
One cannot develop this country with outdated ideas, the Premier said.
The Prime Minister said the government would prepare a policy to take the country forward and would not change with a change of regime. National policies of countries do not change with the change of regimes. The policies in Britain did not change when Prime Minister David Cameron took over from Gordon Brown or when Theresa May took over from Cameron, and US polices will also not change when Trump takes over from Obama, he said.
Public Administration Minister Ranjith Madduma Bandara said salaries of public servants would be increased by two-fold in 2020, and also that the government would introduce a contributory pension scheme shortly. Sri Lanka will convert its pension scheme to a contributory scheme like in India, Japan and several other countries, he said. (Yohan Perera)

Mangala meets Commonwealth Secretary-General
	
Minister of Foreign Affairs Mangala Samaraweera has expressed hope that the Commonwealth will continue to fight for the values that have strengthened Sri Lanka in recent times, such as human rights, rule of law and democracy. 
He met with the Secretary-General, Patricia Scotland, at Marlborough House yesterday.
In Sri Lanka, the government is currently reviewing a newly-formulated Constitution to replace the existing 1978 statute. Last year, Commonwealth human rights experts supported the country to draft a fundamental rights chapter for the new Constitution. This draft proposal is soon to be debated in the Sri Lankan Parliament.
Secretary-General Scotland said the Commonwealth was delighted to give technical assistance to the constitutional realignment to Sri Lanka, particularly to make sure minorities feel represented.
During the meeting, Mr Samaraweera also discussed plans to establish a Truth and Reconciliation Commission to look into the accountability and reparations of events that took place during the countrys civil war. Although different from a commission with a similar mandate in South Africa, the minister recognised the potential benefits of learning from other countries experiences.
Secretary-General Scotland agreed that, it is more economical to work together, to share best practices and pool knowledge. If one of our members spends a dollar, I dont want any other country to have to spend the same dollar. Collaboration in our Commonwealth family is cheaper and more productive, she said.
The Secretary-General also provided more details on plans to open a Commonwealth Office of Civil and Criminal Justice Reform, which will provide all 52 member countries with legal support services and a platform to share ideas and experiences.
She said, we have so much in common, so much that binds us together. We have people from nearly all regions of world. We have a third of the worlds population. Together we are so much stronger. We have the opportunity to lead the world on tackling climate change, and on achieving the SDGs.
The discussions that followed centred on the establishment of the Commonwealth Institute for Digital Health in the countrys capital of Colombo. This project aims to move forward the commitments of Colombo Declaration, launched in October last year, to improve health across the Commonwealth.
Secretary-General Scotland also invited the Government of Sri Lanka to take part in upcoming Commonwealth initiatives, including activities in the month of March to end violence against women, and a Commonwealth cricket club to teach young people about health, teamwork and even maths.

Thai Pongal celebrated as the foretoken of Good Luck and Prosperity
	


Thai Pongal is a thanksgiving ceremony celebrated by farmers in particular to thank the nature spirit, the sun and farm animals for bringing prosperity in agriculture with plentiful harvests. They venerate and thank the sun god and offer the first part of the produce in the form of cooked rice.

The feast of the month of Thai celebrated by rice producers and eaters 
The recipients of this thanksgiving are farm animals, including the cow, ox and the buffalo. Meanwhile, rice eaters are obliged to thank farmers in addition to the sun god and farm animals for producing their staple food crop. The feast of the month of Thai is therefore an occasion celebrated not only by Tamils the world over but is probably the most popular Hindu festival celebrated to announce the approach of a plentiful harvest. 

Epoch of Thai Pongal 
Thai is the first month of the Tamil calendar. Since Thai is an occasion to celebrate plentiful harvests, the festive season falls during the period when the sun enters the zodiac sign of Capricorn (Makara). 
Thus the Rice Harvest coincides with this and Thai Pongal is celebrated after the solstice and on the first day of the Tamil calendar i.e. the first day of the month of Thai. 

Krishna lifting the Govinda Mountain on his little finger 
According to legends, this was the occasion during which Krishna lifted the Govinda Mountain on his little finger to save the people from being washed away by rains and floods.

Meaning of Thai Pongal 
As mentioned earlier, Thai is the first month on the Tamil calendar. Pongal is the act of boiling to overflow. In other words, Thai Pongal is the preparation and enjoyment of the first rice meal of the year. On the one hand, this is a celebration of the achievements of the previous year along with wishes of prosperity for the New Year. 

Pongal O Pongal, we are getting exactly what we expected 
The rituals of this family festival begin with the boiling of a pot of rice at sunrise at the front doorstep of the house. Each family member gathers around the pot of rice. They wish one another with the cry Pongal O Pongal, we are getting exactly what we expected, it is boiling, it is boiling.

The dish called Pongal 
The rice is cooked and prepared as a dish called Pongal, made of Dhal and sugar. There is also a Pongal variety called Ven Pongal. Ven means white. Another variety called Chakkarai Pongal is prepared with Dhal and jaggery. Chakkarai means sweet. Together with Ven Pongal, Vadai, Idly and spicy condiments are consumed. 

Purpose of the Festival 
The main purpose of the ceremony is to encourage social cohesiveness, the building of unity and harmony among people and most importantly, to recognize the services rendered by the farmer. Pongal is the name of the four-day thanksgiving festival. 

Legends connected with Thai Pongal 
Thai Pongal has many legends. The most popular is the story of Lord Krishna lifting the Govinda Mountain to save his people. 
An interesting story related to Thai Pongal says God had instructed his ox Nandi to request his devotees to have an oil bath daily and to consume food twice a week. However, Nandi mixed it up and requested the people to eat daily and bathe twice a week. Lord Shiva was annoyed and said Now the people need to eat more, you stay on earth and help them to plough the land more. 

Thai Pongal  a four day festival 
Thai Pongal is a three to four day festival. A number of elements contribute to make the crops abundant. The sun provides energy, in the process of food production. The rain provides water. Farm animals help in tilling and preparing the land for agriculture and the farmer makes use of all these to make the harvest plentiful. 

Bhogi Pongal 
The first day of the festival which falls on the last day of the Tamil month Margshi is called Bhogi. Bhogi is dedicated to Indra (Bhogi), the god of clouds and rain. 

Bhogi Pongal- a day for the family 
On this day people clean their houses from top to bottom and collect unwanted goods. In the evening, people light bonfires and burn whatever should be disposed of. Homes are washed, decorated, doorways are painted with vermilion and Sandalwood paste with colourful garlands of leaves and flowers decorating the exteriors. Bhogi, the rain god is worshipped. 
In India where the majority of the population are farmers, this celebration is the withdrawal of the South east monsoons and the reaping of a bountiful harvest. 
Pongal pooja is generally offered in an open courtyard. It is cleaned and smeared with cow dung a day before the festival. 

Suriya Pongal 
The second day is Suriya Pongal, during which offerings are made to the sun god and the rain god.
In fact, this is the festival proper where certain customs are followed in anticipation of a new life for everyone blessed with plentiful harvests. The ritual festivities begin early in the morning. Every family member gets up early in time to participate in the festival. They bathe and dress well and gather at the front steps of the house or in the front garden (mutt ram). 

Preparation of the first Pongal meal 
A senior member of the family, the mother, grandmother or father conducts the cooking. The other members assist him or her. When the water is boiled sufficiently, the rice is put into the pot. Those who can afford it prepare special dishes. In addition to cows milk or coconut milk, Dhal, jaggery or chakkarai, kalkandu, roasted green gram (payuru), raisins, cashew nuts and cardamom pods are added to the dish. 
When the meal is ready, family members lay plantain leaves on the floor at the doorstep and place the pudding on the leaves. Before taking the meal, they say a prayer. 

Kolams (Rangoli) 
Kolams are designs created in the front yards of houses using rice flour paste. Presumably, the idea is to provide food for ants and other insects. At the centre is a lump of cow dung, holding a five petal pumpkin flower as a symbol of fertility. These decorations are made as a form of purification.

Maattu Pongal 
The third day is the Pongal for farm animals. Farmers are well aware of the fact that prosperity in the field of agriculture depends largely on the assistance provided by farm animals including the cow, the ox and the buffalo who help the farmer till the land. 
These animals also provide fertilizer for the farmland. Hence the farm animal is an assistant, a friend and close associate of the farmer. On the Maattu Pongal day, domestic cattle are bathed, anointed and fed to their hearts content. They are adorned with garlands of freshly picked flowers around their necks. In South India there was a custom to hang bags of valuable objects around the horns of buffaloes and challenge young men to remove them. Young men wrest with the buffaloes often with success.

Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith, and Fr. Edmond Tillakaratne and Rev. Fr. Anthony Fernandopulle, Secretary of the National St. Joseph Vaz Secretariat at the media briefing to announce the year of St Joseph Vaz
Pix by Pradeep Pathirana 


The Catholic church has declared 2017 The year of St Joseph Vaz and hopes to discover further details about Sri Lankas great apostles life as well as the places he visited. There will also be a special focus on poverty alleviation and the spreading of harmony among different religions and racial groups- virtues St Joseph Vaz brought to Sri Lanka. 
The Archbishop of Colombo, Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith told a media conference We know that he came to Sri Lanka in 1687 and died in January 1711. However, our intention is to reveal more information about his courageous work towards Sri Lankas Catholics and the world.
The Cardinal added that St Joseph Vazs burial place was yet to be discovered. 
It was revealed that the saint had gifted a cross to a family at Sillale in Jaffna and that the familys descendants still had this cross. Another such cross has been found at the Mahagalgamuwa Church in Kurunegala. 
The St Joseph Vaz year will be inaugurated today at a special service to be held at 6 p.m. at St. Lucias Cathedral in Kotahena and will be presided over by the Cardinal. St Joseph Vazs cloak will be taken to St Anthonys Church, Kochikade for public veneration this morning. From there, it will be taken to St Lucias cathedral at 4.30 p.m. today. Tomorrow (15), every parish will conduct special observances to mark the year of St Joseph Vaz. Catholic schools will mark the event on January 16. 
In Jaffna, the celebrations will be held on Monday at the Kondadi Shrine of St. Joseph Vaz. The ceremony will be presided over by the Bishop of Jaffna Rt. Rev. Dr. Justin Bernard Gnanapragasam. 
The ceremony in Mannar will be held at the Church of St. Joseph Vaz at Madhukarai on January 16. 
In Chilaw, the ceremony will be held at the St. Joseph Vaz Shrine, Wattakkalliya on January 22. It will be presided over by Chilaws Bishop Rt. Rev. Dr. Valence Mendis.

Pilgrimages will also be arranged to Goa, the birthplace of St Joseph Vaz. 
Another highlight will be a new vision by the church to promote reconciliation. St. Joseph Vaz set a tremendous example for reconciliation by learning both Tamil and Sinhala, the local languages in Sri Lanka. He not only spoke both languages but lived peacefully with people belonging to both ethnic groups, Cardinal Ranjith said. 
Following in the footsteps of St Joseph Vaz, we should live peacefully with people belonging to other ethnic groups. We hope that those who belong to other religious and ethnic groups will also cooperate with us in bringing about reconciliation, he added.
