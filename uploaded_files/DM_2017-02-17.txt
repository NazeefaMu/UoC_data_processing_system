Air pollution may have caused  3 million premature births  worldwide since 2010
	

Air pollution could be to blame for millions of premature births occurring globally each year, scientists claim. 
Microscopic pollutants given off in diesel emissions and agricultural fires can become lodged in the lungs of expectant mothers. 
This then gets passed down to the developing child and leaves them at risk of being born early, experts warn. A report now suggests this could be the cause of more than 3.4million premature births across the world since 2010. 
Researchers for the Stockholm Environment Institute focused on fine particulate matter - small than 2.5 micrometres in diameter. 
They found that this form of pollution was most dangerous in sub-Saharan Africa, north Africa and south-east Asia. 
These three regions of the world make up for 60 per cent of all of the premature births worldwide, they said. 
SOUTH ASIA had the most air-pollution related preterm births at up to 1.6million incidences, the report showed.Although China has a relatively low rate of premature births, the report revealed that up to 521,000 cases could be linked to air pollution. 
Yet, a lack of research in these areas prompted separate researchers to describe this figure as conservative, The Guardian reports. 
Dr Paul Jarris, chief medical officer at the March of Dimes, a US-based organisation focused on maternal and baby health said: Preterm birth and associated conditions are one of the biggest killers of children in the US and worldwide. 
Yet, theres a lot of things we dont know about what causes preterm birth, so every bit of information we can get is helpful.We have known for a long time that air pollution contributes to asthma and heart disease in adults. 
What I think people fail to recognise is that so many of these risk factors impact babies before they are even born. 
He added: This is one more reason why we need to be good stewards of the environment. 
The most vulnerable among us  unborn children  are affected, and really in a way that impacts families lives for generations. 
Nearly 15million babies worldwide are born each year before reaching 37 weeks gestation, figures suggest. 
Around one in 13 babies in the UK and one in 10 in the US are born prematurely. 
And according to the World Health Organisation, it is the leading cause of death in infants under the age of five. 
Premature babies are at an increased risk of health problems, particularly related to breathing, feeding and infections. 
In the long term, premature babies can suffer disabilities and impaired hearing and sight. 


POLLUTION RAISES RISK OF DEMENTIA 
Air pollution raises the risk of dementia by 92 per cent, researchers at the University of South California found. 
Toxic fumes from cars and power plants causes brains to swell, leading to dementia. 
This may cause a fifth of global cases. 
Women with the dementia gene or living in heavily polluted areas are most at risk.

Colombo bound Malaysia airline flight forced to turn back
	
Malaysia Airlines flight MH179 to Colombo had been forced to turn back to Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA) today due to technical issues, New Straits Times said today.
Malaysia Airlines in a statement said the aircraft, which departed at 10.10 pm yesterday, had to turn back when its auxiliary power unit (APU) was unable to start.
The APU which provides backup power is required to be switched on when an aircraft crosses over water. The aircraft had landed at the KLIA at 1.50 am today.
Due to closure of Bandaranaike International Airport for scheduled maintenance at the runway, an immediate retiming was not possible. Hence, passengers were accommodated at nearby hotels. The flight will now operate as MH179D to depart from Kuala Lumpur at 3.30pm and is expected to arrive in Colombo at 4.35pm (local time) today, the statement said.
The return leg MH178D has been retimed to depart Colombo at 5.10pm (local time) on the same day and will arrive at KLIA at 11:20pm, it said.
Malaysia Airlines said safety has always been the main priority. It apologised to the affected passengers for the disruption.

## Title: Gini Pupuru It is not one more writing!

Gini Pupuru It is not one more writing!
	
The novel, Gini Pupuru (The Sparks) by Sarath Samarasekera is a story which can be read and finished in one breath continuously. It is a quite readable story that tempts one to read it over and over again as it is of a wonderful and unusual taste which makes the book un-put-down-able.
 
The author showed his language competence and creativity by publishing his first literary work, the translation of If You Could See What I Hear an autobiographical novel by Tom Sullivan, as Mata Esena De Obata Dekiya heki Nam in 1999 and his first collection of Short stories as Hithay Ida (Scope in the Mind) in 2004. After 12 years, he publishes his first novel as Gini Pupuru (The Sparks).  The author attempts to present the tragic situation people had to experience in the latter part of the 60s and the early part of the 70s, because of the blunders of the then political leadership, committed through un-farsightedness. The author shows the sympathetic plight a youth falls into, after he was frustrated by falling between two stools, when he is deprived of his higher education and the expected government job because of granting the government jobs on political affiliations disrespecting educational qualifications and the merit.

The protagonist of the story Nandana, is a youth of a poverty-stricken family living in a village, yet he manages to further his higher education under duress and compelling of his mother, with the great expectation of becoming a doctor. Having understood the economic hardships that Nandanas family is undergoing, his paternal uncle who is an ardent supporter of the ruling party, offers him the possibility of obtaining a teaching post. Due to the expectation of the occupation, Nandana gives up his education since the prevalent circumstances made him stay at the uncles farming abode marking time for interviews and etc. Unfortunately, there was a political upheaval and the leftist fraction was chased away from the ruling alliance and Nanndanas name was included in the list of the leftist Parliamentarian who is the friend of the uncle. The leftist Parliamentarian becomes a powerless puppet and the party organizer of the ruling party becomes the omnipotent political authority of the area and he replaces the old list with his new list. Nandana having been disappointed and fallen between two stools becomes one more farming labourer among the work force of the uncle. At the end the depressed Nandana, decides to avenge himself on the powerful party organizer who had caused injustice to him. 
The author has been able to hold the reader spellbound from the very beginning to the end, presenting the reader with a smoothly flowing story.  The vigour of this novel is greatly due to the style of the language of the author. He shows a wonderful aptitude in the apt usage of the jargon of agricultural folklore and the remote peasantry life. In this way he commands the comprehensive trust of the reader. 
Because of the ability of language usage of the author, he has been able to portray a fantastic cognitive image that a by-stander at a river at a moonlit night can witness.  The metaphors and images used by the author is innovative. The effectiveness of their usage makes a great impact on the readers mind. The authors attempt has been to foreground the detriments caused to the society because of the nature of the rotten politics. The characters he uses for that purpose are strongly built by the author. 
The story begins with the portrayal of the realistic role of the teacher and the plight of school education under prevalent social system of that time. A live scene is created by the author in which a tutor/teacher who chase after money and the poverty stricken students who cannot find means to meet the day to day essential expenses. Having passed the decade of 70s, today we witness the rapid development of this concept. 
Characterization is a significant feature of the modern fictions. Some present day critics express their views about complex and comprehensive character building. Just because of the live nature of the characters in Gini Pupuru, it is apt to say the author has taken a keen interest in the characterization. In order to build the live characters of Nandana, Podi Ralahamy and Kira, their mindsets, traits and personal identities along with their speech styles and idiomatic expressions and so on are well utilized by the author. Thereby the author has been able to protect the identities of the character and the reader will feel that these characters are hanging around with the reader. 
Re-creating of the experience, imaginative strength, usage of the language and broad vision of life are the salient features of an artistic invention. The author of Gini Pupuru has been able to present this novel in such a way that the whole narration gets grafted with the readers soul. The novel Gini pupuru which approaches from pleasure to wisdom consists of deep social and political entities.

## Title: J.H. Karunarathna, Justice of Peace  A Silent Buddhist Leader
## Section: News Features
## Date: 17 February 2017 12:14 am
J.H. Karunarathna, Justice of Peace  A Silent Buddhist Leader
	
A well-known figure in Buddhist circles, J.H. Karunarathna, passed away peacefully on February 10, 2017 at his residence at 33, Abeysinharama Road, Colombo 10. At the time of death he was 94 years old. Born in 1923 to a much respected Buddhist family in Welpalla in Pitigal Koralaya, Katugampola Hatpattuva in the Kurunegala District, he had his education at the Welpalla Buddhist Boys School and Welpalla Dhamma School and showed his distinction in passing all the examinations at that level. Fortune brought him to Colombo and due to circumstances he got interested in the motor car spare parts business. He started as an assistant in a motor spare parts enterprise run by a relative of his in a small room at the Bauddha Mandiraya, Fort. Later he established his own business in Panchikawatta and Slave Island under the name Karunarathna Motor Stores in premises owned by him. 
My first acquaintance with late Mr. Karunarathna was in 1960 when the Sasana Sevaka Society of Maharagama, under the patronage of Most Venerable Madihe Paasiha Mahanayaka Thera and Ven. Ampitiye Sri Rahula Maha Thera, elected me as one of the Joint Secretaries, the other being Mr. Karunarathna. I continued with him as Joint Secretary until 1964 and later became a Vice President, its President from 1985 -1992, and still later as President Emeritus until 2015. Mr. Karunarathna continued to be one of its Joint Secretaries and has the longest innings in the post of Secretary until he voluntarily retired from that position in 1994. 
The position of Secretary is one that he cherished very much. He had a perfect hand and all admired his lucid style of writing. I cannot remember any occasion when his record of minutes of a meeting was challenged. He knew what to record and what not to record. It was not the Hansard style where every word was recorded verbatim (allowing for expunging), nor brief like the recording of a Cabinet decision. It was midway between the two and what was recorded could stand on its own feet without references. They formed a valid basis for me to write the history of the Sasana Sevaka Society when it celebrated its golden jubilee in 2007. This speaks much for Mr. Karunarathnas calibre. 
He was a life member of almost all the leading Buddhist organisations in the country and held the position of Secretary of some of them, the most notable were Pettah Buddhist Society started in 1949 (40 years its secretary), Sri Lanka Temperance Society started in 1912 (25 years), Panchikawatta Maranadhara Society (22 Years), Fort Sri Bodhiraja Society (15 years), Buddhist Theosophical Society (nearly 10 years). 
A peep into his life will indicate what a disciplined person he was. In 1993, when he completed 50 years of service to the Buddha Sasana and the community he published in book-form excerpts from the personal diaries he had maintained. The title of his publication was J.H.Karunarathna biography, namely, My Services  J.H. Karunarathna Caritapadanaya nohoth Mage Sevaya. In the introduction he has mentioned that from the age of 12 he got used to writing down important events relating to his life and of general significance in exercise books and from 1940 onwards he switched on to printed diaries to keep records. That was the training ground for that rare skill he possessed of recording events truthfully and precisely. 
An activity that was very close to his heart was organising regular sermons at the Bauddha Mandiraya, Fort under the auspices of the Pettah Buddhist Society. With what glee he had mentioned that during 1949 and 1993 he was responsible for organising personally 385 Bana sermons. After he purchased his car, he himself drove the invited monks from their temples to Fort and back. He relished this activity because he was able thereby to come into close contact with some of the most erudite monks who were excellent expositors of the Dhamma. That was the immediate reward he expected. 
Most Venerable Palene Vajiraana Mahanayaka Thera was one of his closest spiritual mentors. He has mentioned in his biographical sketch that he associated with over 200 monks. Special reference has been made to Most Venerable Kalukondayawe Paasekara Maha Thera, Ven. Pandita Hammalava Saddhatissa Maha Thera, Ven. Madihe Paasiha Mahanayaka Thera, Ven. Narada Maha Thera and Piyadassi Maha Thera. Among lay leaders he had the fortune to associate were Professor G.P. Malalasekera, P.P. Wickramaarachchi, Dr. A.P.de Zoysa and journalist, Piyasena Nissanka. 
There is much more that could be written. But the appreciation above will give a snapshot view of the true qualities of real Buddhist leadership. The Buddha Sasana has survived so far because of such noble people who have served with silence and without praise. Let me end with his words: Rather than wasting my time I have utilised the greater part of it in service to my country, my people, and society, and especially in serving Buddhist organisations. When I think of this I am overjoyed that my life is well spent. How many of us could utter such wonderful words being true to one-self. 
May J.H. Karunarathna attain the supreme bliss of Nibbana and may his Sansaric life be happy and peaceful.

Moscow releases video of its latest fighter jet
	

The Russian Ministry of Defence has released a video of its latest fighter jet in an effort to drive foreign export sales. 
The Kremlin wants foreign governments to buy its latest Sukhoi-35s jet instead of a western aircraft. 
As part of the sales drive, the Russian Air Force released footage of a test pilot taking its Sukhoi Su-35s for a spin. The super sonic jet is being sold as a multi-purpose single-seat fighter with both speed and agility. 
Unlike the F-22 and F-35, the Su-35s is not a stealth fighter and relies far more on dog fighting skills like older aircraft such as the F-16. 
Several cameras have been fitted to the aircraft in the video as it performs a range of high-energy manoeuvres.According to Jane Defence Weekly, China has already purchased 24 SU-35s worth an estimated $2 billion. 

The aircraft has a maximum speed of Mach 2.25 at 36,000 feet and carry 8,000kg in weapons with a range of around 1,000. 
Russia claims the aircraft is better than the wests fourth generation aircraft, such as the US F-16 and French Rafaele and even the RAFs Typhoon interceptor. 
The Su-35s is fitted with a 30mm cannon for air-to-air dog fighting as well as the capability of carrying rockets, missiles and bombs.

No shortage of rice in local market: Bathiudeen
	
Minister of Industry and Commerce Rishad Bathiudeen yesterday said that there was no shortage of rice in the market as imported rice volumes had begun to flow into domestic retail and wholesale channels.
Minister Bathiudeen accompanied by officials of the Consumer Affairs Authority (CAA) on Wednesday (15) made a surprise visit to a privately owned rice warehouse at the Fifth Cross Street in Colombo to see if claims of a rice scarcity were true.
After completing the inspection the minister told the media that imported rice was being distributed and rice shortages are now ending. He therefore assured the public that there was no rice shortage in the country at the moment.
I visited many shops and rice wholesalers in and around Colombo and they were all selling rice at the stipulated Maximum Retail Prices (MRPs). Certain outlets were even selling rice at below the market prices," he said.
A shop in Colombo 5 was selling Ponni Samba at Rs. 64 a kilo when the MRP for it is Rs. 80. Consumers have been requested to call our hotline 1977 to complain about any instances when rice is sold at prices that are above the MRP, he said.
About 250 officers belonging to the CAA were engaged in checking rice prices across the island today. I request the public to stop spreading false rumours about imported rice being sold above the MRP. The rice that I am talking about here is not the domestically milled rice but imported rice on which we reduced the import tax to a mere Rs 5,he pointed out. (Chaturanga Pradeep)

## Title: Papaya  leaf  extract as a Dengue cure

Papaya  leaf  extract as a Dengue cure
	
Sri Lanka is no exception where, dengue infection is a priority for the national health services for prevention and reducing mortality. In desperation, many people have resorted to use papaya leaf extract covertly
What is this hullabaloo, to say it in colloquial terms about eating leaves. Did Dr. Rohan Wijekoon say the leaves should be eaten raw - No. He wanted the tender leaves cooked or in a form that is eatable. There is nothing wrong, because according to my grandmother, during the 1800s severe drought, the yams of water lillies were boiled and then tied around the waste and then when they were hungry, these boiled yams were eaten 
Over the years leaves have been part and parcel of the life of rural Sri Lanka. There were Home gardens in practical every home in rural areas and they partook the leafy vegetables from these gardens. Even manioc leaves are dried for a day and then cooked for a meal. They have been used as medicinal herbs as well. So we now come to Papaya tested out now as a remedy for Dengue. 
There is now an on-going investigation on leaf extract from fresh Papaya for hematological parameters and toxicological changes for treating Dengue. 

This question was touched at a  Workshop on Dengue  organized by the Faculty of Medicine, Peradeniya. This was in collaboration with  Centre of Research in Tropical Medicine . 
For two hours experts in the area of Dengue spoke at the Senate Room of the University of Peradeniya. Their opinion was that Dengue would have in most people, but it is the serious ones that has come out into the open.The speakers were Dr. R.M. Abeyratne, Professor Ms.F. Noordeen, Dr. Udaya Ralapanawa, Professor Ananda Jayasinghe and Dr. R.M. Mudiyanse. 

In 2016, there had been 54,945 cases reported while only 75 have died. It was pointed out that most would be having the disease and would have overcome even without their knowledge. Professor Ms.F. Nordeen spoke on the research conducted and that this has been conducted on Dengue at the Faculty of Medicine in the University. 
The research on Papaya extract was carried out by a team, Sinhalagoda Lekamlege, Chandi Asoka, Dharmaratne, Susiji Wickramasinghe, Roshia Waduge, Jayanthi Rajapakse, and Senanayake Kularatne.

The study was to evaluate the effect of hematological, biochemical and toxicology changes in mice after the administration of papaya leaf extract, as one of medicinal plants which has been used worldwide as a remedy food, cosmetic and widely cultivated around the world. 
People in rural areas have used papaya leaf, as an alternative to treat dengue and dengue haemorrhagic fever. They believe this plants leaves can increase the platelet level of dengue patients shortly after receiving juice boiled or raw of the leaves, says the researchers. 
The researchers in their comments say that it is an interesting study of the effect of papaya leaf extracts. The finding are also impressive, they add, would be useful for continuous study related to papaya leaf, which could be an alternative to treat dengue and malaria fever instead of prescription drugs. 
The Papaya plant is laltiferous as it contains specialized cells known as lactifers that occur in most tissues and secrete latex. Lactifiers secrete latex and are dispersed throughout most plant tissues. The Papaya-latex is well known for being a rich source of the four cysteine endopeptidases namely papain, chymopapain, glycyl endopeptidase and caricain. Leaves contain an alkaloid called carpaine and a glucoside named carposide. Different parts of the papaya plants including fruit, dried fruit, leaves, dried leaves, stems, seeds and roots have long been used as ingredients in alternative medicine. For instance, the seeds are used for expelling worms and roots and seeds are used as an abortifacient agent. The leaves (especially fallen ones) are used variously for the treatment of fevers, pyrexia, diabetes, gonorrhea, syphilis, inflammation and as a dressing for septic wounds. 
Untested herbal medicines could be potentially injurious to human health. Many plants used in traditional and folk medicines are potentially toxic, mutagenic, and carcinogenic. Toxicological studies of extracts from different parts of papaya plants such as seeds, fruit, roots and leaves have been carried out using several animal models. Acute and chronic toxicities of unripe fruit of the C.papaya have been documented. Some of the traditional claims of efficacy that have been investigated scientifically using animal models and their efficacy have been proven. Recent studies showed that C.papaya leaf extract has potential anti- sickling (inhibition of sickle cell formation) properties. Indran et al. have shown that there is a protective effect against gastric ulcers in rats. Moreover, C.papaya flowers are known to have antibacterial activities[15]. The contraceptive efficacy of the seeds of C.papaya has been earlier demonstrated in rats, mice and rabbits. Oral administration of C.papaya seed extract could induce reversible male infertility and could be used for pharmaceutical development of a male contraceptive. 
Today, the researchers say, many tropical and subtropical countries are engulfed by dengue infection which is caused by viruses belonging to the Flaviviridae family. There is no specific therapy for dengue even though the infection has a significant mortality. Sri Lanka is no exception where, dengue infection is a priority for the national health services for prevention and reducing mortality. In desperation, many people have resorted to use papaya leaf extract covertly. This is applicable even to hospitalized dengue patients. However, recommending C. papaya leaf extract for dengue infection is unethical until it is proven by scientific research. Therefore, in the present study, we have investigated the effects of oral intake of pure extract of C. papaya leaves on haematological/biochemical parameters and toxicological changes in the murine model. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Experimental animals Male white mice (average body weight 32-33 g) 6 weeks old, obtained from the Medical Research Institute, Sri Lanka were used as the model for haematological and toxicological investigation.
Animals were kept in the animal house of the Faculty of Medicine, University of Peradeniya. Three experimental trials were conducted during May 2011 to May 2012 using three sets of mice. Mice were divided into two groups, control and test, in all three trials. For the first and second trials, we used 48 mice (for each trial 12 mice/ control and 12 mice/test) and for the third trial, 36 mice were used (18 control and 18 test). All mice were given a standard commercial diet with free access to water. All mice in both test and control groups were numbered by ear tattooing. The first trial was a pilot study to plan a proper study where the following variables were considered-dose of C. papaya leaf extract, timing of blood sampling and histopathological changes in liver. The second trial refined the methodology and the third provided the results presented here. Ethical clearance was obtained from the Ethical Review Committee of the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine and Animal Science, University of Peradeniya, Sri Lanka. 
The research is ongoing at the Faculty of Medicine and Veterinary Science of the University of Peradeniya on Dengue.

President reveals why he removed Mohan Peiris
	
President Maithripala Sirisena revealed, yesterday, that the first action he took using his executive powers was to remove former chief justice Mohan Peiris, when he came and begged him not to remove him from his post and expressed his willingness to do anything he wanted.
The president disclosed how Mohan Peiris visited him at his residence after he assumed duties on January 9, 2015 and promised to take action in his favour and implored him not to remove him from his post of CJ.
The president revealed this while addressing a public meeting in Warakapola.
Chief Justice Mohan Peiris came to meet me at 10.00 pm on the day after I assumed duties as president and told me not to remove him from his post. He said he would deliver his judgments according to my wishes. I told him there was no intention of removing him from his post and told him to leave my residence, the president said.
But he returned the next day and begged me not to remove him from his post, he said.
Then I realised how these people had been in the habit of giving judgments to suit the previous regime. Therefore, I decided to remove him from his post at once, using my executive powers for the first time, he said. (Pushpakumara Mallawaarachchi)

SL must have foreign judges in war crime probe: HRW
	
Sri Lanka must employ international judges and prosecutors to ensure accountability during trials of those responsible for alleged war crimes against mostly Tamils, Human Rights Watch Australia's director Elaine Pearson has told SBS News on Friday.
Ms. Pearson's call, which echoes a recommendation in the 2015 UN Human Rights Council report of the OHCHR investigation of Sri Lanka, comes as Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe visited Australia this week.
On Wednesday, he beckoned asylum seekers who fled to Australia to return, assuring they would be "quite safe".
"They can come back to Sri Lanka and we will help them... but remember, they broke the law by attempting to come to Australia," he said.
UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Raad Al Hussein said in 2015 "Our investigation has laid bare the horrific level of violations and abuses that occurred in Sri Lanka, including indiscriminate shelling, extrajudicial killings, enforced disappearances, harrowing accounts of torture and sexual violence, recruitment of children and other grave crimes."
Both the Sri Lankan government and the rebel Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam were likely to have committed the abuses, the investigation found.
The investigation recommended Sri Lanka bring to trial those responsible for alleged war crimes in a court that was both domestic and international - where the international element would help ensure accountability.
It urged the country to integrate "international judges, prosecutors, lawyers and investigators that will be essential to give confidence to all Sri Lankans in particular the victims, in the independence and impartiality of the process, particularly given the politicisation and highly polarised environment in Sri Lanka."

T20I;Sri Lanka beat Australia by 5 wickets
	
Chamara Kapugedera's last-ball boundary has given Sri Lanka a five-wicket win over Australia in their opening T20 clash at the MCG.
The tourists were cruising at 3-151 in the 18th over, before first-gamer Ashton Turner snared the wickets of Asela Gunaratne and Milinda Siriwardana.
Scores were then tied on the last delivery, with Kapugedera pumping his fist in glee after driving Ashton Tye through cover for the match-winning runs.
Sri Lanka scored 5-172 in reply to Australia's 6-168 from their 20 overs.
Top Sri Lankan paceman Lasith Malinga made a successful return to international T20s - he was on a hat-trick late in the Australian innings, finishing with 2-29 from four overs, and also took two catches.
Gunaratne top-scored with 52 from 37 balls, giving him the last laugh in the match.
When Gunaratne came on to bowl, Australian captain Aaron Finch blasted his first ball 20 rows back into the Southern Stand.
Australia made a dream start in the field when Pat Cummins had captain Upul Tharanga caught behind for a duck in the opening over.
It was a bad night for Tharanga - after winning the toss, he dropped a straightforward chance off Travis Head.
After Tharanga's dismissal, fellow opener Niroshan Dickwella and Dilshan Minaweera took control with a blistering stand of 74 from 47 balls.
Legspinner Adam Zampa temporarily blunted the Sri Lankan charge when he dismissed Dickwella (30 from 25 balls) and Munaweera (44 off 29) in successive overs.
Then Turner dismissed Gunaratne and Milinda Siriwardena (15).
Kapugedera made 10 not out and Seekugge Prasanna was unbeaten on eight.
Zampa was the pick of the Australian attack with 2-26 from his four overs.
Finch top-scored with 43, also passing 1000 T20 international runs.
The opening match of the three-game T20 series was Malinga's first full international in nearly a year, because of injury and illness.
It was also a milestone night for Australians Michael Klinger, Turner and Billy Stanlake, plus Sri Lankan Vikum Sanjaya, who made their T20 international debuts.
Australia have several top players unavailable because of the Indian Test tour.
The game attracted a solid crowd of around 42,511, with Sri Lankan fans in the majority.
Klinger, at 36 the oldest Australian T20 international debutant, combined with Finch for a solid opening partnership of 76.
Malinga took catches to dismiss the pair - Klinger making 38 from 32 balls.
Two balls after Finch's big six, he skied an edge to Malinga and the following over, Tharanga dropped Head.
"It was a good time to drop a catch," Australian coach Justin Langer noted during the match telecast.(Wide World of Sports)

Tamil Nadus jailed leaders ally assumes power
	

NEW DELHI AFP Feb16, 2017- An ally of disgraced Indian politician V.K. Sasikala was on Thursday sworn in as the next leader of Tamil Nadu state, ending a weeks-long tussle over succession marked by bitter infighting. 
Palanisamy took the reins of the ruling party after Sasikala was spectacularly hauled off to prison for graft just as she was on the verge of becoming chief minister of the southern state. 
The corruption case dates back to the late 1990s, when Jayalalithaa and Sasikala were accused of profiting from the chief ministers office and acquiring wealth beyond their income. 
They were jointly accused of illegally amassing bungalows, luxury cars, tea estates and vast quantities of gold worth the equivalent of $10 million. 
She had already been nominated for the top job before she was convicted Tuesday of amassing illegal assets worth $10 million, barring her from holding office for a decade.

UN and EU pledge to help reconciliation in SL
	
Chief Minister of the Northern Province C. V. Wigneswaran had been informed by the United Nations and the European Union that they had pledged their cooperation to promote reconciliation between all communities in Sri Lanka.
Coordinator to the United Nations Una Makoli and Ambassador of the European Union Toolai Margue had indicated this during a meeting with the Chief Minister on their tour of Jaffna on Wednesday (15).
The visiting delegates had a lengthy discussion with the Chief Minister on the present political situation of Sri Lanka and also the affairs of the Northern Provincial Council. Among the matters that had been discussed was the necessity of a power sharing through the new constitution and also the additional powers the Northern Provincial council would be vested with.
The delegates during their visit to Jaffna also outlined the manner in which the UN and the EU would allocate aid and assistance for the development of the North by processing the funds through the Sri Lankan government.
In his reply the Chief Minister stated that much thought should be put into whether the people of the North are aware of the steps taken by the government towards the development of reconciliation, the delay in the setting up the office of Missing Persons and also the lack of progress in the political decisions taken by the government.

Woolly mammoths could be brought back from the dead in two years
	

Woolly mammoths became extinct thousands of years ago, but now scientists claim they are just two years away from bringing woolly mammoths back from the dead. 
The shaggy beasts last wandered the tundra of Siberia before our human ancestors probably hunted them into extinction. 
Now a project to bring back the mammoth said within two years the nearest possible thing to a mammoth could be created. 
It would be a hybrid between an Asian elephant and a mammoth  perhaps you could call it a mamephant.t would be created from the DNA extracted from frozen mammoth carcasses retrieved from permafrost. 
If the Harvard University scientists succeed it will mark a turning point in plans to revive mammoths  by programming their genes into an Asian elephant. 
The bundle of cells would have genes for mammoth features such as shaggy long hair, thick layers of fat, and blood that is perfectly suited to flowing in sub zero conditions. 

But years of work lie ahead before any serious attempt can be made to produce a living creature. 
The scientists have ambitious plans to grow it within an artificial womb rather than recruit a female elephant as a surrogate mother. 
Since starting the project in 2015 the researchers have increased the number of edits where mammoth DNA has been spliced into the elephant genome from 15 to 45.Professor George Church, who heads the Harvard team, said: Were working on ways to evaluate the impact of all these edits and are basically trying to establish embryogenesis in the lab. 
The list of edits affects things that contribute to the success of elephants in cold environments. 
We already know about ones to do with small ears, sub-cutaneous fat, hair and blood, but there are others that seem to be positively selected.He added: Our aim is to produce a hybrid elephant/mammoth embryo. Actually, it would be more like an elephant with a number of mammoth traits. 
Were not there yet, but it could happen in a couple of years. 
The woolly mammoth roamed across Europe, Asia, Africa and North America during the last Ice Age and vanished some 4,500 years ago, probably due to a combination of climate change and hunting by humans.  Their closest living relative is the Asian, rather than the African, elephant. 
De-extincting the mammoth has become a realistic prospect because of revolutionary gene editing techniques that allow the precise selection and insertion of DNA from specimens frozen over millennia in Siberian ice.
