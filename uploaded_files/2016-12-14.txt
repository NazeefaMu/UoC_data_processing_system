A storm rocks the ?Tree? again!
	
?
The Tree party led by the flamboyant purohita Haq Kim is said to be in the throes of a crisis again.
?
Troubles had flared up again when the party leader, Kim after making a hurried amendment to the party Constitution, informed the Elections Commission that his ambitious rival Ali from the East was removed from the post of general secretary of the Tree party and a ?Soor? was appointed in his place.?
However, the strongman Ali ruling the roost in the East had immediately informed the Elections Commission that his purported removal from the post of party secretary is a wrongful act and that he continues as the party secretary de facto and de jure. And the Commission had advised both parties to sort out their dispute internally.
Now that the ball is back in the party, the gulf between the two factions is said to have further widened and the anti-Kim stalwarts from the East are reportedly planning to lay the ground to install a new person from the East as the party leader. ?
Meanwhile, Tree party sources claim that the incumbent leader commands the majority support in the party?s supreme body.

An unwelcome invited guest
	
?
It was a grand wedding, held in a five-star hotel close to Diyawanna. The bride was the daughter of a white-collar bigwig holding very high secretarial status in the yahapalanaya administrative nerve-centre. In fact, he held high secretarial status under the previous regime as well.
?
The Yahapalanaya Number One and the Diyawanna Council Chair were present to do the honours as the witnesses.?
The former strongman was among the VIPs invited, but he was conspicuous by his absence. ?His sibling who once helmed the country?s defense establishment too had been invited to the wedding by the groom?s side.?
The bride?s father had gone into a fluster when he heard that that the former defense boss was expected to be present at the wedding as a distinguished guest from the groom?s side. And he wanted to prevent his attendance at any cost. So he decided to make an appeal to the unwanted guest himself.?
??I just wanted to ask you, Sir, whether you wouldn?t mind skipping our wedding?I am so sorry to have to make this appeal,? the top secretarial one told the former defense boss.
Taken aback by this unusual appeal, the former defense boss asked the bride?s father why he was making this request.
?If you attend the wedding, the newspapers will surely make a big song and dance about your presence at the wedding with pictures and all that which might create many unnecessary problems. So I wanted to kindly ask you to skip the wedding and attend the homecoming??
The former defense boss replied: ?It was not you who invited me to the wedding, but the groom?s side. Anyway, if my presence is going to create any trouble for you, I would surely keep away from the wedding and the homecoming too!?
?Oh! No?? the bride?s father had tried to make an apologetic comment, but the former defense boss had already dropped the call. ?This secretarial one had caused a similar affront to another one-time close colleague of his from the days of the former strongman,?they say.

Ayurvedic doctor claims he can successfully treat Dengue, STDs
	
Dr. D. D. A. Hettiarachchi, a traditional ayurvedic doctor from ?Ganemulla, claims to have found cure for Dengue and several Sexually Transmitted Diseases (STDs) including Herpes and HIV/AIDS, and says he has saved hundreds of lives in his services of over?
50 years.?
?Even though Dengue is not deadly, the society has labelled it so. This is not a new disease. It has existed in the past, as far back as B.C. 92 in ancient China. I have come across it in ancient books as ?Break-bone? fever. The ayurvedic name for Dengue is ?Dandaka fever? - as it hurts like being beaten with a batton. I have also treated many patients with Dengue symptoms in the past, before society even came up with the term. By now, I have been treating Dengue patients for nearly 15 years. Some people have natural antibodies against Dengue, but some do not. Western medicine doesn?t have a cure for the disease, which is why it is considered lethal. But there are alternatives like the treatments I give. I have cured western doctors too. However, decent western doctors admit that Dengue could be cured with ayurvedic medicine. Some of them have even sent me patients they failed to cure,? the doctor commented.?
?I can cure any Dengue patient within 18 hours. I have held discussions with many ayurvedic and western doctors regarding my treatment, but they come to a halt after the directors and authorities attempt to snatch my secret formula, which they are determined to have. Using my know-how to treat Dengue-inflicted patients is not their focus. I reiterate, Dengue is curable. I don?t want to affront any medical tradition, what I do and want to do is to heal patients. I am ready to face any challenge in the context of curing Dengue patients. The malady should be managed well and it cannot be done by staying at home; it needs the caring of a hospital as doctors and nurses do the necessary blood tests. Dengue is a virus and there are no cures for viruses in western practices. People are hurt by various diseases every day because they give up medicine and the traditional way of life,? Dr. Hettiarachchi added.?
Many tourists have come to him seeking a cure for their diseases, especially HIV and other STDs. He is treating an HIV-infected person in Botswana by sending her the required medicines on a monthly basis. He has patients from countries like Germany and USA, and most of them have requested him to work abroad, but he wants to remain in his home country and serve it to the best of his ability.?
Dr. Hettiarachchi has been visited by a number of patients including military officers, doctors and lawyers. He has many reports requested from the patients related to various stages of sickness.?
The treatment
Dengue treatments should be carried out within 18 hours. There are only two medicines to provide - an ointment to be applied on the head and ears, with a powder to drink mixed with a piece of papaya leaf and king coconut flower juice. It is given thrice at six hour intervals. This medicine has saved the lives of many. The doctor suggests that Ebola virus could also be cured by this treatment, if detected in Sri Lanka.?
Mother of a three-year-old Dengue patient?
Lakmali, a mother of three and half year old son narrated how his was successfully treated for dengue by Dr. Hettiarachchi. ?My son was detected with Dengue when he was just three years old. He was hospitalized at the IDH for six days. His blood count dropped and he had begun to bleed internally. Doctors had given up on him and it was a visitor to the hospital who told us about Dr. Hettiarachchi. Later, my husband visited the doctor and he was given the medicine. Just one hour after applying the given oil, my son was able to urinate after it being blocked for hours. Although my son bled inside hours before, soon after treatment, he showed signs of recovery. Within only two days, his blood count returned to the normal state, bewildering all doctors. As my sister?s son was also affected with Dengue, he was given the same treatment and he too recovered,? she said.?
History of Dr. Hettiarachchi?
Dr. Hettiarachchi was a student of the Hiththatiya Gunarathna Mudalinda Pirivena, the first Pirivena in the South, where he learned traditional ayurvedic medicine. He later schooled at Kajjuwattha weda walawwa. Those two places were leading institutes for training traditional ayurvedic doctors at that time.?
treatment for HIV/ Herpes
Dr. Hettiarachchi had conducted a research on HIV at the IDH ?Hospital only to be interrupted halfway due to lack of funds. He claims that he could cure HIV and many other STDs. According to him, the HIV germ activates three to four months after it first enters the body, and later, detectable side effects appear. If patients come for treatment before the germ activates, he says with eight, 10 or 12 months of treatment, the patient could be cured. If the ELIZA test results negative two or three times, the disease is believed to be cured. He has completely cured eight patients suffering from HIV and nearly 75 patients with Herpes.?
A cured Herpes victim ?
A patient found to be a Herpes victim underwent three years of medical treatment before he came to Dr. Hettiarachchi.?
?I came to Dr. Hettiarachchi four months after the disease was detected. Now I am having treatment for two years and nine months. My reports show negative results now,? he said.
Eternal cycle of diseases
Commenting on diseases and related consequences, the doctor said: ?Diseases cannot be eliminated forever, as being sick is an eternal cycle. Diseases spread and deplete from time to time. There are antibodies for sicknesses, but there are times when we cannot fight with internal antibodies only. We should always be on guard against what is known to be bad. People should be satisfied with what they get, without running after for more than they have. The more you chase things, the more misery will you have to face. Most of the people who come to me with social diseases are either married but looking for sexual pleasure out of the family or had sought sex at a very young age.??
?The government officials are not cooperating and the government is not appreciative of my research work, treatment or the yeoman service I render to the needy. Once I informed the former president about my efforts, and as a result, former Director of the Bandaranaike Memorial Ayurvedic Research Institute Prof. K.K.D.S. Ranaweera had several discussions with me to do a research at the IDH ?with the Dengue team there, but the discussions didn?t turn into a research,? the doctor said.?
Commenting on his skills and experience, the ayurvedic doctor said: ?Many helpless patients are deceived by dishonest ayurvedic practitioners who charge huge sums for treatment. Now I am 70 years old, and I want to do as much service as I can to cure patients before my demise. I request the government, the directors of the Ayurveda Medical Council and all those who are responsible to use me for the well-being of the ill. I assure I can cure Dengue, HIV and Herpes and other STDs. If I am sponsored to do research work on HIV and other STDs, if I am given a ward or a unit in an ayurvedic hospital, then I can serve patients with utmost dedication, whether it is Dengue or HIV.???
?This treatment needs to prove scientifically?-
Prof. K.K.D.S. Ranaweera - Former Director of Bandaranaike Memorial Ayurvedic Research Institute, Maharagama?
?It is difficult to prove Dr. Hettiarachchi?s medicine scientifically, and the reports he has cannot prove the miracle of his medicine. We discussed about him with our doctors, as there are people like that everywhere. We were also willing to help him even though we were a little suspicious about him. Therefore, we asked him to bring the patent of his finding. But, he never did so. Actually we don?t believe it as a successful treatment, and he is somewhat afraid of being robbed of his formula. We informed him that if he could prove the validity of his treatment, there was no rejection from us. We cannot be satisfied with the method he claims to have used to save Dengue patients. His medicine should start from the first detection of a Dengue patient and be measured with before and after progress. Sometimes, Dengue gets cured even without any treatment. But, I do not reject his cure out of hand. He and many other people who claim to have found a cure for Dengue expect sudden recognition from us. If we give that kind of recognition to anyone, it should happen with a scientific reasoning and systematic research,? the professor said.

Did the JO man take his colleagues for a ride?
	
?
How a uniformed bigwig found himself at the centre of a storm when a phone conversation he had with a ?sir? at a public function went public is no longer news. By the way, there had been much more to this drama than had met the public eye.
?
Everyone knows that the JO stalwarts pounced on this issue with glee as they found it ideal grist to their anti-government mill. And they created a big ho ha about it in the Diyawanna council too.?
According to the latest turn of this sensational episode, a particular JO big gun from Matara had incited his colleagues to raise this hue and cry over the affair for personal reasons. The story runs like this: ?Nilame? connected to a popular devalaya in the South on whose behalf the mysterious ?sir? had spoken to the uniformed bigwig happens to be a close pal of the former strongman and he is planning to contest the next general poll with the latter?s blessings. As the man is already popular because of his ?nilame? status and is to get the blessings of the former strongman on top of that, the particular JO big gun from Matara had realized that he would be a poor match for this ?upstart? at a future poll. So he decided that the best way to put him out of the scene was to brand him as a Green man.?
The JO stalwarts hailing from the South who were the first to get wise to their colleague?s ploy are said to be telling one another these days that they have to be wary of the ones from their own tribe trying to fish in troubled waters!?

EXCLUSIVE-Neo Liberal policies are the cause for world strife: Prof. Noam Chomsky
	
The world?s leading public intellectual, Prof. Noam Chomsky in an exclusive interview with Daily Mirror, spoke on many issues that have pervaded the current political scenario.? In the interview, he details the reasons behind the election victory of Donald Trump, his views on the rise of the ?Right Wing? and the causes that resulted in the people losing confidence in mainstream political establishments.
Noam Chomsky, one of the world's most cited scholars, considered the ?Father of modern linguistics?, a paradigm shifter in Human Sciences, Cognitive Scientist, Philosopher and the world's leading political dissident, spoke to Daily Mirror on a wide array of topics at his study at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in Cambridge, Boston. Having written his first landmark work ?Synctactic Structures? laying the groundwork for the scientific study of language in 1957, he co-created the Universal Grammar theory and the Generative grammar theory among others. Chomsky's foray into political dissidence was during the Vietnam War when he penned down an anti-war essay titled ?The Responsibility of Intellectuals?. His activism resulted in multiple arrests and was placed on consecutive watch lists by the Government of United States. He has since spearheaded thought through numerous books and publications, most of which are political in nature including ?Manufacturing Consent? (1988), ?Understanding Power? (2002), ?Necessary Illusions? (1989), ?On Power and Ideology? (1987), ?Problems of Knowledge and Education? (1971) ?Propaganda and the Public Mind (2001) and ?On Palestine? (2015), among many others.
Born on December 7, 1928 to Jewish parents in Philadelphia, Avram Noam Chomsky developed a keen and critical mind, questioning the existing institutional, academic and governance structures since his early teens. As an undergraduate at the University of Pennsylvania (UPenn) Chomsky studied philosophy, logic and languages after which he was named to the Society of Fellows at the Harvard University. Thereafter he commenced teaching at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), where he currently continues to have ties with as a Professor Emeritus. He married Carol Doris in 1949 to whom he remained faithful until her death in 2008. He is the father of three children and currently resides in Boston. He shared the following:
Q: It is both a pleasure and a privilege to have you speak for the first to a Sri Lankan entity - The Daily Mirror. Since we are confined by time, I would appreciate if the answers are kept as brief as possible. To start off with, during the recent election of Donald Trump, we saw a kind of rise of racism and xenophobia, a phenomenon of right wing populism that we are seeing across the world including in Sri Lanka. What are your views on this?
A: There are many factors but there are some that are pretty common, certainly for the United States and Europe from which I have just returned, incidentally. One factor that is common and which is very significant is the Neo Liberal programme that was instituted globally, roughly around 35 years ago, around 1980 or a little before and picking up afterwards. These are programmes that were designed in such a way that they marginalize and cast aside a considerable majority of the population. So in the United States if you take a look at say the Trump voters, they are not the poorest people. They have homes, they have jobs, and they have small businesses. They may not have the jobs they like but they are not starving and are not living on US$ 2 a day. These are people who have been stuck for 30 years. Their history and their own image of life and history and the country is- that they have worked hard all their lives, they have done all the right things. They have families, they go to Church and they have done everything right just as their parents did. They?ve been moving forward, which they expected to continue: that their children would be better off than they are, but it hasn?t happened. It stopped. As if they are in a line, in which they were moving forward and it stopped. Ahead of them in the line are people who have just shot up into the stratosphere: that is Neo Liberalism. It concentrates wealth in tiny sectors. They don?t mind that, because part of the American mythology is that you work hard and you get rewards. It is not what happens but that fits the picture, the mythology. The people behind them are the ones they resent. This is not untypical; scapegoating. Blame your problems on those who are even worse off than you. And their conception is that the Federal Government is their enemy, which works for the people behind them. That the Federal Government gives Food Stamps to people who don?t want to work, that it gives welfare payments to women who drive in rich cars to welfare offices. (These are) images that Ronald Reagan concocted. Their thinking is that, ?the Federal Government is helping to put them in line ahead of me, but nobody is working for me?. That picture is all over the West. A large part of it was behind the Brexit vote, in the United States they would blame Mexican immigrants, or Afro Americans, in the UK they would blame the Polish immigrants, in France the North Africans and in Austria the Syrian immigrants. The choice of target depends on the society, but the phenomenon is pretty similar. The general nature is pretty similar. There are streaks of racism, xenophobia, sexism, and opposition to gay rights and all sorts of things. And they coalesce when economic and social policies have been designed in such a way which essentially ignores these people and their concerns and doesn?t work for them -- and seems to them to work against them.
Q: But don?t you think Professor, the notion of an isolationist imperial power, a non-intervening imperial interest that Donald Trump has promised, is something positive for countries like Sri Lanka and the third world at large?
A: Isolationist is a very funny word. Take Donald Trump?s recent appointments -- the important appointments. The most important appointment is his National Strategy Advisor who is Michael Flynn. He is a radical Islamophobe. He thinks we should go to war with the whole Islamic world,-- the whole Islamic world. And his view of Islam is not that of a religion, but that it?s a political ideology like fascism, and it is at war with us and that we should destroy it. Is that isolationism? Donald Trump?s position and that of Paul Ryan and other Right Wingers is that we should sharply build up the Pentagon. They talk about our depleted military forces. I mean you don?t know whether to laugh or not. The US spends almost as much on the military as the rest of the world combined. It is technologically far more advanced. No other country has hundreds of military bases all over the world, actually forces fighting all over the world. But ?we are a depleted military force and everybody is about to attack us and we have to build the military more?, is that isolationist? We have to carry out economic war against other countries, is that isolationist? No of course not. This is vulgar imperialism masked by a fraudulent concern for the working people and the middle class. Is there any such concern apparent from his cabinet appointments? (they are) straight out of Wall Street and Goldman Sachs. Take a look at the stock market, that tells you how people with power are evaluating his Presidency. (it) Shot up as soon as he was elected. The financial institutions zoomed. The world?s biggest Coal Company ?Peabody? which was in bankruptcy had its stock go up by about 50% within days of his election. The military industry, energy industries, pharmaceuticals..they are all going to the sky. Is that an illusion? No, it?s not. That?s the policy, the appeal is not so much the poor, but working people who have suffered, not suffered in the sense of real deep poverty, but suffered in the sense of a loss of status, a loss of dignity, and a loss of hope for the future. In the United States this is combined with an objective fact. That this country is built on extremist white supremacy, comparative measures of white supremacy across the world has put the United States way in the lead, even ahead of white South Africa, and now the white population is becoming a minority.
Q: You bring in two interesting points; one is on white supremacy and the other is on Islam and Islamophobia. Firstly though, this idea of supremacy, we have seen this even in parts of South Asia. If you see the rise of Narendra Modi, it was along the same populist lines and even in post war Sri Lanka we are seeing these same attitudes swelling up. So it is not something confined to the US. What do you think the real reason is for this?
A: Different reasons for different places. In India it?s the rise of Hindu nationalism, which is extremely dangerous. It looks like there is an alliance building up with these xenophobic Right Wing forces around the world. If you noticed, the reactions to Trumps election across the world, was great enthusiasm from the ultra-Right all over. In fact, his first contact was with Nigel Farage, the leader of the UKIP in England and it went on like that. There are common features, but different factors in different countries. In India, it is the Muslims, in the United States it?s Muslims too. But there were also Mexicans and so on. But I think throughout the world you see a similar failure of mainstream establishment institutions to deal with the people?s real problems.
Q: Aren?t these fears about the Muslims real? Even in Sri Lanka, there is this fear about the Muslims, along the lines of the fear prevailing in the West. Aren?t these fears about the Muslims real?
A: They are not unreal. Hitler?s fears about the Jews under the Nazis were not totally unreal. There were rich Jewish bankers, there were Jewish Bolsheviks. Any propaganda system, no matter how vulgar or disgraceful, can only succeed if there are at least small elements of truth. They may be small. While you are in Boston if you listen to ?Talk Radio? the main radio- all very Right Wing - you will hear people speaking about Syrian refugees and how they are being treated like princes. That they have been given all kinds of money, that they have been given health services, and education - ?all kinds of things that we don?t have the Syrian refugees get?- How many Syrian refugees are there? A couple of thousand! They probably do get health services, so it is not totally false. But the typical history of scapegoating is to pick vulnerable people and find something that is not totally false about them- because you have to have some element of truth- and then build it up into a colossus which is about to overcome you. I mean there are states in the United States in the Midwest, where the legislature has passed laws banning Shari'a. How likely is Shari'a going to be imposed in Oklahoma? I mean you know it is not zero. You can find a woman somewhere who is wearing a veil, so there is something. But that?s the way it works. I think in Sri Lanka there is a pretty ugly history after all; I don?t have to recount it. You can find plenty of cases of massive atrocities and crimes and so on. A demagogic leader and the administration which is not working in the interest of the population but in the interest of wealth and power, almost reflexively is going to turn to attacks on the vulnerable with the support of the media and often the intellectual classes, and blow up small elements of truth into a massive attack. The United States is extremely interesting in this respect. It is the most safe and secure country in the world, but it is probably the most frightened country in the world. Do you know any other country where people feel that unless they take a gun to Church or a restaurant they might be attacked? I mean, does it happen in Sri Lanka? No! Does it happen anywhere else? but it happens in the United States of America. All over the United States people feel terrified -- ?they are coming after us?, and that goes way back in American history, and it has roots. There are historical roots.
Q: Going by what you just said Professor, Edward Said, one of your contemporaries and friends writing in the early 80?s in his seminal work ?Orientalism? and ?Covering Islam? points out that Islam has been portrayed by the West, as a monolithic entity. That the West ignored the different histories and different cultures and so on. Have the Muslims of today, 30 years on, bought into this propaganda and believe themselves that they are in fact a monolithic entity?
A: Take the US or the British policy towards Islam. It has been highly supportive of the most radical elements of Islam. That is true of the British and it?s true of the Americans after they took over from the British. So who is the leading US ally in the Islamic world? Saudi Arabia, perhaps the most extreme, radical, fundamentalist State in the world. But certainly in the Islamic world. And a missionary State, which uses its huge resources to sponsor its Wahabist extremism through Madrasas and so on. It is the main source of Jihadism. The main ally is that -- monolithic. I mean what state power does, and propaganda usually follows, is (to) find what will support a power interest. In these cases imperial policy. If it happens to be radical Islam that?s fine. At the same time we might be fighting radical Islam somewhere else. The propaganda system would create images of Islamic terror seeking to destroy us when that turns out to be the plausible kind of scapegoating. So 9/11 happened and the Tamil Tigers atrocities happened. You can use those as ways of building up fear, anger, and anxiety to support the tendency to hide under the umbrella of power from these forces about to destroy us. Like Shari'a law in Oklahoma, got to protect ourselves!
Q: You spoke of a new shifting of the world order when you spoke of Nigel Farage and other Right wing elements shifting towards Donald Trump. Is there a shift in the international sphere, like we saw during the Cold War, where the world went into two different sides including the non-aligned? A kind of shift today that is happening, between the Right Wing nativists on the one hand and the Left wing internationalist on the other?
A: First of all, I don?t really agree with the conventional version of the Cold War. You take a look at the events of the Cold War. Not what intellectuals talk about, not the ideology. Take a look at the events. The events of the Cold War consisted of violent attacks by the US within its domains -- which is most of the world. And Russian, violent attacks its much smaller domain, which was Eastern Europe. That was the Cold War. Each side used the alleged threat of the other as justification for its own internal repression. So the US had to support a terrorist war against Nicaragua because of the Russians, who were not anywhere nearby. The Russians had to invade Hungary because of the Americans. That was the Cold War. There was, in a way, you could describe it as a kind of tacit compact between the two imperial powers: The huge imperial power of the United States, the smaller imperial power of Russia. Kind of a tacit compact in which each side was authorized to carry out violence and repression in its own domains, for the US this means most of the world, without an actual conflict. Now there was a danger, always, a serious danger that an actual conflict might blow up in which case we?re finished. As soon as there is a major nuclear war, humans are done with. So there was always a fear, if there is a confrontation; but if you look at the events of the Cold War you get a very different picture. And it?s the events that matter, not the words.
Q: But is there a realignment across the world, Professor, between this Right-wing populist xenophobic elements and?
A: No, there is Left liberal populism too, take the United States.
Q: You gave me a good precursor to the next question. Isn?t the left liberal dead? I know you?ve had your differences with Slavoj Zizek but as he points out what Clinton personified and is a symbol of is that Left liberal position- a coalition which had you and also Alan Dershowitz, which had ?Occupy Wall Street? and Wall Street together. Isn?t this coalesce?
A: There is lack of comparison there. Alan Dershowitz speaks for the, it?s kind of a mixture, but the xenophobic extremist Right -he is all over the place. The Left liberal media, say NPR, he?s on it all the time, Right wing media he is on it all the time. Then there?s me. Am I on (them)? In fact, when you leave, take a photograph of one of my favourite front pages of a journal. I liked it so much I framed it. It?s the main Left liberal journal ? ?American Prospect? ? and it has a picture of two evil creatures who are threatening American liberalism, one is Dick Cheney and the other is me. That?s the parallel. And it indicates what?s in the mind of American liberals -?We?re being attacked by these monsters on both sides?- One of them who sits in an office and has no access to anything, the other- the guy who controls the biggest military machine in the world and is invading Iraq, those are the two forces. Same with the rest, ?Occupy? versus Wall Street, what?s the comparison? Actually, there is a comparison, but not what?s being described. ?Occupy? is very small, it doesn?t begin to compare with Wall Street. But the population does. And a lot of the population supports them (Occupy). In fact take the US election, in terms of numbers, Clinton won pretty easily. But more interestingly, if you look at younger voters, first of all Clinton won overwhelmingly, but Sanders won even more overwhelmingly. Here is somebody who came out of nowhere, no economic support, no rich supporters, no corporate support, 100% media opposition, basically unknown, talking about socialism, which is a bad word, and overwhelmingly won the youth support. Well, the constituency that supported him does not have money, power, corporate backing, and so on. So they are not considered popular, they are just kind of off the spectrum of discussion, but they are there. And they can change policies.
Q: Professor, since you spoke of the youth, we have watched you speaking about how Universities dumb down thinking or intellect. You are a person who, since your early teens, you have questioned the status quo, do you see that among the youth today? Are the youth questioning the status quo as much as they should?
A: Well, why did an overwhelming majority of young people support Bernie Sanders? That is the answer to your question. Yes, of course they are challenging the status quo. They don?t have wealth, military power, corporate backing, media backing, nor support from intellectuals; but sure, they are challenging the status quo. All the time.
Q: But across the globe, aren?t you also seeing them move toward the nativist nation state concept?
A: You are seeing that, but you are also seeing something like the Sanders phenomenon, Soy Podemos in Spain. I just happened to be in Barcelona, Barcelona is a major city, and the mayor who was just elected is a Left-wing activist. These things exist all over Europe. The Corbyn phenomenon in England, the Labour Party elite is bitterly opposed to it, of course the Tories kind of like it, because they want to see the Labour Party collapsing. But, it?s substantial. As soon as Corbyn opened a possibility for people, ordinary people, to participate, the Labour Party shot up. These are real opportunities. Take the Trump voters in the United States, many of them voted for Obama in 2008. Why? If you remember the campaign slogan, it was ?hope? and ?change? and they were voting for hope and change. They didn?t get any hope and they didn?t get any change, so they are disillusioned and now they are voting for someone else who is calling for hope and change.
Q: But don?t you see that happening even in South Asia? That it?s either Trump versus Corbyn? That the liberal middle ground, for which I use Hillary Clinton as a symbol is losing ground. That you need to pick a side, instead of staying in the centre?
A: Everywhere. Everywhere, the mainstream political organisations which are kind of centrist -- centre Left or centre Right -- are diminishing and collapsing. That is true of institutions too. There?s anger at institutions, contempt for them, hatred of them. Not just the political institutions, but the banks, the corporations, just about everything except the military. This, to go back to our original discussion, is a reflection, substantially, of the Neo Liberal policies of the past generation. It has harmed much of the population, offered nothing to them, given power and prestige to extreme wealth and professional elites who are protected. So, it leads to anger and resentment against the established institutions.
Q: Moving on, has the media changed landscape since you wrote ?Manufacturing Consent? in 1989? Is the media manufacturing consent now?
A: Well, we didn?t actually say that media is manufacturing consent; we said that -that is what they are trying to do. We discussed the nature of the media. There?s a separate question ? to what extent is it effective? And that?s an interesting question, but we didn?t discuss it. They?re still doing it in the same way. In fact, dramatically. Take November 8, two things of critical significance happened on November 8. One of them was massively reported, the other, which was much more important, received no report ? that was the Marrakesh Conference of two hundred countries that tried to implement the Paris programmes to try to save the human species from destruction. That?s a lot more important than what happened in the US election. And, in fact, it was undermined by the US election. What happened in Morocco is astounding if you look at it; one country was leading the way to try to save civilization from self-destruction. One country was way behind, trying to lead the way towards self-destruction, the first was China the second was the United States. That is a remarkable spectacle. Did you see a comment on it?
Q: Nothing
A: That is manufacturing consent.
Q: Finally, you have come to the evening of your life after over half-a-century of being the epitome of pioneering thought and intellectual discourse, what are your views on religion? And what is your personal belief of life after death?
A: Personally, it means nothing to me, but if it means something to other people, that is fine. As long as they don?t bother others. I don?t ridicule it, I don?t have contempt for it, I have respect for their views, but they are not mine.
Q: And your views on religion, you were born into a Jewish family and raised?
A: Well, remember that Judaism is fundamentally a religion of practice, more than belief. So, say my grandfather, who was basically still living in the 17th century Eastern Europe was ultra religious. But if I had asked him, did you believe in God? He probably wouldn?t have known what I was talking about. Judaism means carrying out the practices. My father was basically secular, but deeply involved in Jewish life. If you go to a New England church on Sunday morning, you would find people who are deeply religious, but not believers. Religion to them means community, associations, helping each other, having some common values and so on. Religion could be all sorts of things. But to me, it doesn?t happen to be a value; if other people do, that is their business. (Hafeel Farisz)

Five missing pilgrims rescued
	
Five pilgrims who went missing in the Nallathanni forest in the Sri Pada reserve on Monday were rescued by the Police Special Task Force (STF) today after they were located by the Sri Lanka Air Force (SLAF) yesterday, Military Spokesman Brigadier Roshan Senavirathne said.
The police, Disaster Management Centre (DMC) and the military had launched search and rescue operations, when the five individuals, including two women, who entered the Sri Pada forest reserve through the upper division of the Laxapana Estate in Nallathanniya went missing.
Four of the pilgrims were identified as residents of Nugegoda and the other was identified to be a Laxapana Estate worker.
SLAF said the DMC had requested assistance to locate and rescue the missing persons. Therefore, a SLAF rescue team led by Squad Leader Uditha de Silva and six others including three rescuers were deployed in a Bell 412 helicopter from the Ratmalana Air base on Tuesday evening.
Squad Leader Silva said the forest cover and the conditions made it impossible for the helicopter to deploy its rescue team after the group was located.? With the light and conditions deteriorating, the helicopter proceeded to land at a nearby safe location and transmitted the GPS coordinates to the ground rescue personnel.
The Bell 412 was on standby yesterday morning to be deployed to the site once more to heli-drop food and supplies until the ground rescue team could reach the victims.? (Darshana Sanjeewa)

## Title: I can treat Dengue, says Ayurvedic doctor

I can treat Dengue, says Ayurvedic doctor
	
Dr. D. D. A. Hettiarachchi, a traditional ayurvedic doctor hailing from Galle in Ganemulla, claims to have found cure for Dengue and several Sexually Transmitted Diseases (STDs) including Herpes and HIV/AIDS, and says he has saved hundreds of lives in his over 50 years? service.
?Even though Dengue is not deadly, the society has labelled it so. This is not a new disease. It has existed in the past, as far back as B.C. 92 in ancient China. I have come across it in ancient books as ?Break-bone? fever. The ayurvedic name for Dengue is ?Dandaka fever? - as it hurts like being beaten from a batton. I have also treated many patients with Dengue symptoms in the past, before the society even came up with the term. By now, I have been treating Dengue patients for nearly 15 years. Some people have natural antibodies against Dengue, but some do not. Western medicine doesn?t have a cure for the disease, which is why it is considered lethal. But there are alternatives like the treatments I give. I have cured western doctors too. However, decent western doctors admit that Dengue could be cured with ayurvedic medicine. Some of them have even sent me patients they failed to cure,? the doctor commented.
?I can cure any Dengue patient within 18 hours. I have held discussions with many ayurvedic and western doctors regarding my treatment, but they come to a halt after the directors and authorities attempt to snatch my secret formula, which they are determined to have. Using my know-how to treat Dengue-inflicted patients is not their focus. I reiterate, Dengue is curable. I don?t want to affront any medical tradition, what I do and want to do is to heal patients. I am ready to face any challenge in the context of curing Dengue patients. The malady should be managed well and it cannot be done by staying at home; it needs the caring of a hospital as doctors and nurses do the necessary blood tests. Dengue is a virus and there are no cures for viruses in western practices. People are hurt by various diseases every day because they give up medicine and the traditional way of life,? Dr. Hettiarachchi added.
Many tourists have come to him seeking a cure for their diseases, especially HIV and other STDs. He is treating an HIV-infected person in Botswana by sending her the required medicines on a monthly basis. He has patients from countries like Germany and USA, and most of them have requested him to work abroad, but he wants to remain in his home country and serve it to the best of his ability.
Dr. Hettiarachchi has been visited by a number of patients including military officers, doctors and lawyers. He has many reports requested from the patients related to various stages of sickness.
The treatment
Dengue treatments should be carried out within 18 hours. There are only two medicines to provide - an ointment to be applied on the head and ears, with a powder to drink mixed with a piece of papaya leaf and king coconut flower juice. It is given thrice at six hour intervals. This medicine has saved the lives of many. The doctor suggests that Ebola virus could also be cured by this treatment, if it is detected in Sri Lanka.
Mother of a three-year-old Dengue patient
?My son was detected with Dengue when he was just three years old. He was hospitalized in IDH for six days. His blood count dropped and he had begun to bleed internally. Doctors had given up on him and it was a visitor to the hospital who told us about Dr. Hettiarachchi. Later, my husband visited the doctor and he was given the medicine. Just one hour after applying the given oil, my son was able to urinate after it being blocked for hours. Although my son bled inside hours ago, soon after the treatment, he showed signs of recovery. Within only two days, his blood count returned to the normal state, bewildering all doctors. As my sister?s son was also affected with Dengue, he was given the same treatment and he too recovered,? she said.
History of Dr. Hettiarachchi
Dr. Hettiarachchi was a student of the Hiththatiya Gunarathna Mudalinda Pirivena, the first Pirivena in the South, where he learned traditional ayurvedic medicine. He later schooled at Kajjuwattha weda walawwa. Those two places were leading institutes for training traditional ayurvedic doctors at that time.
Cures for HIV/ Herpes
Dr. Hettiarachchi had conducted a research on HIV at the IDH Hospital only to be interrupted halfway due to lack of funds. He claims that he could cure HIV and many other STDs. According to him, the HIV germ activates three to four months after it first enters the body, and later, detectable side effects appear. If patients come for treatment before the germ activates, he says with eight, 10 or 12 months of treatment, the patient could be cured. If the ELIZA test results negative two or three times, the disease is believed to be cured. He has completely cured eight patients suffering from HIV and nearly 75 patients with Herpes.
A cured Herpes victim
A patient found to be a Herpes victim underwent three years of medical treatment before he came to Dr. Hettiarachchi.
?I came to Dr. Hettiarachchi four months after the disease was detected. Now I am having treatment for two years and nine months. My reports show negative results now,? he said.
Eternal cycle of diseases
Commenting on diseases and related consequences, the doctor said: ?Diseases cannot be eliminated forever, as being sick is an eternal cycle. Diseases spread and deplete from time to time. There are antibodies for sicknesses, but there are times when we cannot fight with internal antibodies only. We should always be on guard against what is known to be bad. People should be satisfied with what they get, without running after for more than they have. The more you chase things, the more misery will you have to face. Most of the people who come to me with social diseases are either married but looking for sexual pleasure out of the family or had sought sex at a very young age.?
?The government officials are not cooperating and the government is not considerate of my research work, treatment or the yeoman service I render to the needy. Once I informed the former president about my efforts, and as a result, former Director of the Bandaranaike Memorial Ayurvedic Research Institute Prof. K.K.D.S. Ranaweera had several discussions with me to do a research at the IDH Hospital with the Dengue team there, but the discussions didn?t turn into a research,? the doctor said.
Prof. K.K.D.S. Ranaweera - Former Director of Bandaranaike Memorial Ayurvedic Research Institute, Maharagama
?It is difficult to prove Dr. Hettiarachchi?s medicine scientifically, and the reports he have cannot prove the miracle of his medicine. We discussed about him with our doctors, as there are people like that everywhere. We were also willing to help him even though we were a little suspicious about him. Therefore, we asked him to bring the patent of his finding. But, he never did so. Actually we don?t believe it as a successful treatment, and he is somewhat afraid of being robbed of his formula. We informed him that if he could prove the validity of his treatment, there was no rejection from us. We cannot be satisfied with the method he claims to have used to save Dengue patients. His medicine should start from the first detection of a Dengue patient and be measured with before and after progress. Sometimes, Dengue gets cured even without any treatment. But, I do not reject his cure out of hand. He and many other people who claim to have found a cure for Dengue expect sudden recognition from us. If we give that kind of recognition to anyone, it should happen with a scientific reasoning and systematic research,? the professor said.
Commenting on his skills and experience, the ayurvedic doctor said: ?Many helpless patients are deceived by dishonest ayurvedic practitioners who charge huge sums for treatment. Now I am 70 years old, and I want to do as much service as I could to cure patients before my demise. I request the government, the directors of the Ayurveda Medical Council and all those who are responsible to use me for the well-being of the ill. I assure I can cure Dengue, HIV and Herpes and other STDs. If I am sponsored to do research work on HIV and other STDs, if I am given a ward or a unit in an ayurvedic hospital, then I can serve patients with utmost dedication, whether it is Dengue or HIV.??

Making a killing by cooked up billing
	
?
Government for some time had been buying ?bada-irungu? (sorghum) from the farmers in Rajarata as a relief measure. ?The authorities instructed a certain State-run enterprise to purchase ?bada-irungu? harvested during the last season as usual after releasing the required funds for the purpose.?
?
According to reliable information, only 30 metric tons of the grain has been purchased by the State-run enterprise, but billing figures are being cooked up to show that 51 metric tons of the stuff ? the ceiling stipulated for buying - ?has been purchased from the farmers, they say.
The high-up of the state-run enterprise responsible for manipulating the billing is expected to make a killing at the rate of about Rs.8 a kilo of the grain, employees who have got wise to this swindle say.
Meanwhile, some employees of this enterprise which has long been known to the public as a hotbed of corruption, are set to expose the fraud.

The high political authority explaining the rationale behind his proposition to the media heads who listened to him with raised eye brows had said: ?True, this grouping is a challenge to our party. But the best way to overcome this challenge is to blow up the main character of the party. Because, the more prominence this worthy gets as its organizer, more supporters are sure to veer away from it in disgust!?

While rejecting the complaint made by the joint opposition over a financial misappropriation of a whopping Rs.1, 500 million, Foreign Employment Minister Thalatha Atukorale today referred a letter to the Bribery Commission (BC) requesting an immediate investigation on the complaint.
Addressing a media briefing, Mrs. Atukorale said she had directed a letter to the BC Director General requesting necessary action on the complaint made against her, proceeded by an immediate investigation.
?A group of politicians, claimed to be the ?Joint Opposition,? has filed a complaint against me stating that I have caused the State a loss of Rs.1, 500 million by the mandatory insurance scheme of the Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment (SLBFE) for all Sri Lankan migrant workers since August 2015," she said.
Mrs. Atukorale stated that the allegations in the complaint lodged by the joint opposition were completely false and baseless, and added that she was ready to accept any sort of punishment for these kind of baseless allegations if she was proven guilty.
On a different note, she said a least amount of funds from the Budget were allocated for the functioning of the SLBFE.
?It had never operated with State funds,? she added. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)

Pictorial warnings on beedi and cigars: Rajitha
	
The Health Ministry will introduce pictorial warnings on beedi and cigars similar to the pictorial warnings on cigarette packets, Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne said.
?This is not an easy task because the beedi is small in size and cigars are wet and do not come in packets like cigarettes. However, we want to discourage the smoking of beedi and cigars as they are also harmful like cigarettes. After all, the government policy is to put an end to smoking and the use of tobacco,? he said. "To further discourage the manufacture of beedi and cigars, the Government, in September, increased the import tax on tobacco for the manufacture of cigars and beedi leaves to Rs.3,000 a kilo from the earlier Rs. 2,000. This is in addition to the 90% tax on cigarettes."
The minister said 65 people die each day from smoking-related diseases while 200 die each day from tobacco and alcohol-related diseases.
"The Health Ministry spends Rs.4,500 million each year to treat patients suffering from smoking- related diseases and many of the victims are between the ages of 40 and 45, he said.
Commenting on the Health Ministry?s efforts to control Non-Communicable Diseases (NCD), the minister said the government was also contemplating increasing the tax on sugar, salt and processed food. (Sandun A Jayasekera)

Prorogation: To avert a predicament?
	
?
There is widespread speculation about a move afoot to prorogue the present session of the Diyawanna council.
?
The move had originated from the Green party leadership keen on sidestepping some controversial issues and challenges staring them in the face, they say.
A prorogation would normally cause the Select Committees like the COPE and the COPA to lapse and all matters being handled by these committees would go into the cold storage.?
Meanwhile, sources close to the highest echelons say there is a strong possibility of the council being prorogued sooner or later to make way for the yahapalanaya Number One to make a policy declaration in view of the already made arrangement for the council to meet as constitutional assembly beginning January.?
By the way, a story doing rounds in political circles says that the Number One turned down a request made by the Green leadership to go in for an immediate prorogation.?

Report on Hambantota port incident handed over
	
The Navy had handed over its report on the Saturday?s incident at the Hambantota Port, where the Navy Commander had allegedly attacked a journalist, to Defence Secretary Karunasena Hettiarachchi today.
A tense situation prevailed at the Hambantota Port when the Navy tried to release two merchant ships seized by protesting workers on December 10.
On Sunday, Defence Secretary asked the Navy to submit a report on the allegation that the Navy Commander had threatened a journalist during the protest.
?The Navy yesterday submitted a full report over the incident that took place at the Hambantota Port. First, I need to study the report and then will take necessary steps,? Mr. Hettiarachchi told the Daily Mirror.
Earlier, the Navy said it took swift measures to disperse the port employees, who staged a protest campaign at the Port premises.
They said the protesting employees were obstructing the operations of the Merchant Ships berthed in the jetty and causing damage to the ships and the adjacent facilities by using heavy machinery, equipment and gantry cranes to block the movement of ships. (Darshana Sanjeewa)

Ports and Shipping Minister Arjuna Ranatunga said the government could not lose any income to the country because of political needs.
?We have had to send several ships away from the Hambantota Port and one ship was sent to the Colombo Port due to the protest. Several more ships will arrive tomorrow,? he said.
He said if the employees reporting to duty were less, some more people from Hambantota would have to be recruited and added that until then some employees from Colombo would be called on to Hambantota.
The Minister said damage had been caused to the computer system of the port and floor area due to the sabotage by the protesters.
?We will assess the loss caused to the Port due to sabotage by the protesters and take legal action against them. The loss of income to the Port due to the protest will also be revealed by next week,? Mr. Ranatunge said. (Ajith Siriwardana)

Teenager faking his abduction arrested
	
A 17-year-old boy, who tried to cheat his father by staging an abduction drama and demanding that a sum of Rs.77.5 million be paid to his 'abductors' to buy his release, was arrested yesterday by the Dankotuwa Police, along with two others.
This student had recently sat for the GCE O/L examination.
He had told his father he was abducted by an unknown gang in a white van and that he was being held by them until a ransom of Rs.77.5 million was paid in order to release him.
According to police, the two friends of the student were also taken into custody for helping him commit fraud. One of the two had been studying hotel management while the other was a student following a course in technology.
They had confessed that the main suspect had asked them to help with his plan to extort money from his father.
The 17-year-old boy had told police after his arrest that he believed that a rich relation of his mother would have given his parents the money to pay the ransom for his release.
He had phoned his father and said he had been abducted by unknown persons while he was on his way home after playing at the Godella Ground in Gonahena in the Dankotuwa Police Division at about 6,30 on Tuesday (13) evening. He had attempted to show that he was being harassed by one of the gang members who he said was wringing his neck.
One of the others, who had pretended to be one of the kidnappers, had phoned the boy's father and had threatened him saying he would kill the man's son if the ransom money was not paid. He also gave him directions on how to hand over the money and the place and time.
However, the boy's father, ignoring the threats made to him, had gone to the Dankotuwa Police Station and made a complaint about his son's abduction to the Dankotuwa OIC IP H. L. Dushmantha.
While the police was conducting the investigations under the direction of the Chilaw Division DIG Nuwan Wedasinghe the kidnapped student had come to the police yesterday (14) morning at about 4.00 with his father. The boy had said he was able to escape from his kidnappers and come home.
However, the Police, after getting suspicious about the way the student was explaining about what had happened to him, questioned him further and was able to get the truth out of him. (Srinath Prasanna Jayasuriya and Chandana Fernando)
