Alert passengers rescue harassed tourist couple on private bus
	
On a Wednesday night in September (20th), around 7.30 pm, I boarded a bus (No 3344), from Pettah, which was taking passengers on the highway, to Negombo.?
The big Bus was full and I got a seat about 5 or 6 rows down from the entrance in the middle row. People who sit on these seats have to get up and make way for the passengers who get off after Katunayake.??
As there were a whole lot of passengers I got busy with my phone just like the others. Suddenly someone prodded me. When I looked up it was the conductor. He didn?t say ?buy your tickets? and instead prodded me with his finger! He didn?t give me a ticket and I demanded one, upon which he gave me two. This helped me later on.??
A couple of minutes later, I heard the conductor shouting ?Four Hundred!? ? Four Hundred!? nastily and someone from behind shouting back ?No, I won?t give!?. When I looked behind, in the row behind me, there was a young foreign couple and it was the girl who was retorting. I then inquired form her whether she bought the ticket and she said she paid RS 300. I told her a ticket cost Rs.130 and they should receive a balance of Rs.40. I asked her as to why the conductor was demanding another Rs.400. She then looked behind and indicated that it was for their baggage ? two medium sized suitcases kept standing upright just behind the last row of passenger seats. I was shocked! As the suitcases weren?t on two seats- in which instance some conductors charge for the seats taken- being charged Rs.200 each per bag meant that they were being charged more than the fee for a one way ticket to Negombo!??
?
I asked her as to why the conductor was demanding another Rs.400. She then looked behind and indicated that it was for their baggage ? two medium sized suitcases
Then the conductor was shouting nastily at? them saying, ?get down!? get down!?. By now we were passing Technical College. I was alarmed, wondering as to how they could get off with their bags etc. in the middle of the journey, mainly because this was a foreign couple and also given that it was now night. I inquired form the conductor as to why he was charging for the baggage. He didn?t answer me. When the young man next to me advised me, ?let the bus conductor and the tourist sort it out?, I protested. The girl next to him said ?Now when we go abroad, we don?t have to pay for our baggage?.? I agreed with her and we continued discussing the rude behaviour of the conductor. The guy kept quiet. When such an attitude is showcased in public by males like this, no wonder commuters are harassed. Not only conductors there are occasions when the bus drivers are nasty too! Commuting by private buses, especially in Sri Lanka, with the deafening music that blares, one has a memorable experience to say the least!??
Then there was this wonderful young man from Kochchikade who protested aloud and sternly demanded that he can?t make them get down like that in the middle of the journey. I was also able to mumble something in protest. Thereafter the conductor returned to the area near the door of the vehicle. Mind you, 95% were male passengers in that bus and not a single passenger protested except this young man! It was just this young man who stood up and I salute him!??
?
8.30 pm or so, I intended to get off just one halt before the main Negombo bus terminal in order to get a taxi to get home. But as the tourists didn?t get down, I thought I should disembark at the terminal itself, lest these two are harassed once again.??
To my surprise, a big made lady ( I am a teeny weeny by the way) too intended to get down, but she was too stayed on. We started discussing the rude behaviour of the conductor. The boy, who stood up for them, got off with another boy and remained looking up at the bus without going his way, until the tourists got down. All other passengers dispersed!??
?The young tourist couple got off last as they had to collect their bags. And before we could get to them taxi drivers surrounded them to obtain the fare for the hire. When we went towards the couple these taxi drivers became very hostile. They were just as vicious with us as we were when dealing with the bus conductor! We told them that these two had some problem in the bus and that?s why we want to talk to them to know whether anything untoward happened when disembarking from the bus. But the taxi drivers were shouting and waving their hands saying ?What happened in the bus is over, now you let us handle them?. We were horrified!? ?
However, we managed to ask the foreigners whether they were forced to pay the Rs. 400 the conductor was demanding. The girl said ?No, I didn?t give them? very emphatically.??
The Russian girl was clad in a Saree and the couple?s concern now was to get a room and they didn?t know where to go and were concerned about the prices too. I suggested to them to go to Ethukala where there are plenty of guest houses. The taxi drivers were still shouting and waving their hands disturbing us. Then the other lady took the phone and said she would call the police (she was actually dialing the police), they quietened.??
?

The young tourist couple got off last as they had to collect their bags. And before we could get to them taxi drivers surrounded them to obtain the fare for the hire
?
This lady told the young couple that she would go to the police and also find a place for them to stay overnight. She took them away quickly and they too went happily with her. She would have mentioned the word ?Police? to drive fear into the taxi drivers. We were quite concerned because we were near the taxi drivers? stand. I managed to thank the young man for being so civic minded, but unfortunately could not ask his name nor the name of the lady, who was so concerned. But the boy told me that he was from Kochchikade when I asked him and we parted our ways quite shaken.??
When I returned home I promptly called the Ethukala Tourist Police who asked me to contact the Negombo Police in turn and I did. There was a very courteous police officer named Sargent Gamage at the Special Unit to take down such complaints by tourists. He took down all details and promised me that he will contact the conductor and take appropriate action and thanked me for bringing this incident to his notice.??
When I followed it up the next day he said he had already notified the Negombo Bus Depot about the conductor and the driver. They had been told to report to the Negombo Police Station. Then on September 22nd when I called Sergent Gamage, he said that this bus belonged to the Katunayake Depot and that he had instructed them to told the conductor and the driver to report to the Negombo Police Station. He old me that this would take 2-3 days, but told me not to worry and that he would certainly follow up the incident. It then occurred to me that since they ply on the Colombo-Katunayake Airport route, they probably fleece the tourists for their baggage, otherwise this conductor could not have brazenly asked, before all of us, for Rs.400 from a bus that plies from Colombo to Negombo. Could we, the Sri Lankans of this so called ?paradise isle?, who are full of love and compassion, allow tourists to experience such a difficult situation?? No wonder there are warnings given to tourists through? the internet they they shouldn?t travel to Sri Lanka. These warnings suggest they might be murdered, raped or gang raped, fleeced of their precious money and belongings and be abused!??
?I hope the Russian couple, despite experiencing this unpleasant incident, realizes that there are also people in this ?Paradise Isle? who care!??
The Ministry of Tourism, the Tourist police and the Private/Public Transport Ministry should take note of this and afford these tourists the necessary courtesy, security and whatever that goes to make their stay in this country pleasant and memorable.??
On September 23, in the morning, I received a call from Sergent Gamage. He said that the conductor and the driver had reported to the Negombo Police Station and an inquiry was in progress. I reminded him that since they ply the Colombo-Katunayake Airport route, they are probably used to fleecing the tourists for their baggage and he said ?may be?.??
I salute Sergent Gamage for following up on this complaint quickly and reprimanding them for ?highway thuggery?. I am so thankful and proud that there are still such fine police officers such as Sargent Gamage in the police department and wish him an unblemished career in his chosen profession.??
?
Ms. N. Wickramasinghe.??

Australia facing pressure over Lankan refugee death
	
The United Nation's refugee arm has urged Australia to lift its game and ensure there's proper care for people detained in Papua New Guinea following the suicide of a Sri Lankan Tamil.
The 32-year-old's death on Monday morning was the sixth refugee fatality on Manus Island in four years.
Australia's immigration department confirmed the death at Lorengau Hospital but directed inquiries to PNG authorities.
Refugees and asylum seekers on the island held a memorial service for the man on Monday afternoon and it's believed his family in Sri Lanka have been notified.
Refugee Action Coalition spokesman Ian Rintoul confirmed the man had been facing rape charges against a local woman following an alleged incident at a motel last year.
The matter was yet to go to court and the man had intended to vigorously defend the charges, Mr Rintoul said.
Sudanese refugee Abdul Aziz said the man had been his roommate before he moved to the transit accommodation centre outside the detention complex four months ago.
He said his friend had applied for resettlement in the US but was yet to hear back on the outcome.
'He was nice guy and quiet guy,' Mr Aziz told AAP on the phone from Manus Island.
'In the past few months he's been having... mental problems and was in need of care.'
Mr Aziz said after a recent psychiatrist appointment the man had been kept in isolation at the detention centre for four to five days before he was sent to Lorengau.
'If he was offered appropriate health care and support he wouldn't have to take his own life,' Mr Aziz said.
'There are not enough doctors or proper treatment.'
The local magistrate on the island will be conducting a coroner's investigation over coming days.
The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees said Australia had an ongoing responsibility to provide critical services to asylum seekers and refugees it has transferred to Papua New Guinea and Nauru.
This is despite the fact the detention centre on Manus Island is due to be closed later this month.
'Once again, such tragedy highlights the acute vulnerability of refugees and asylum-seekers under Australia's offshore processing approach and the need for proper care,' the agency said in a statement.
Human Rights Watch director Elaine Pearson was on Manus Island less than a fortnight ago and witnessed the heavy toll on refugees' mental health.
'Australia's experiment in human suffering needs to stop immediately,' she said.
The suicide is the second refugee death on the island in as many months.
The body of Iranian refugee Hamed Shamshiripour was found near refugee accommodation in early August.
Meanwhile, more than 50 refugees last week left Manus Island and Nauru for a new life in the US. (Sky News)

Catalan leader calls for international mediation

REUTERS, 2 October, 2017- The leader of Catalonia called for international mediation on Monday to resolve a stand-off with Madrid, the day after hundreds were injured as police tried to forcibly disrupt a referendum on independence that had been ruled illegal.??
?It is not a domestic matter,? Carles Puigdemont told a news conference on Monday. ?It?s obvious that we need mediation.???
Sunday?s events in the autonomous region dramatically raised the temperature in a festering split between Madrid and Barcelona and made it harder for the two sides to sit down to try to find a political compromise.??
Images of riot police using rubber bullets and batons in a show of force to stop the vote shocked Spain and drew international condemnation. Authorities said almost 900 people had been injured.?

Colvin?s appointment an attempt to silence SLMC: GMOA
	
The Government Medical Officers? Association (GMOA) today claimed that Prof. Colvin Gunaratne?s appointment as the new Chairman of the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) was one that had been done to circumvent the SLMC?s objections on SAITM.
While expressing its displeasure over the recent appointment, the GMOA said it could be viewed as Health Minister Senaratne playing his trump card in order to silence the SLMC and safeguard the SAITM institute, a duty that he had taken upon himself to accomplish by hook or by crook.
In a letter addressed to the President and the Prime Minister, the GMOA had expressed its displeasure over the Health Minister?s actions and said they were dismayed to hear of Professor Gunaratne?s appointment as the new Chairman of the SLMC.
Addressing a press conference in Colombo, GMOA Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said it was an arbitrary decision of Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne to appoint Prof. Gunaratne to the post.
He said during an earlier occasion when Health Minister submitted Professor Gunaratne?s name for the post it was rejected by both President Maithripala Sirisena and the Prime Minister after considering the strong objections posed by the GMOA.
Dr. Aluthge said Professor Gunaratne was well known for his pro-SAITM bias and his involvement in pharmaceutical industry had convinced a majority of those in the SLMC and GMOA to reject his candidacy. His unwillingness to confirm or deny these accusations had also served as proof of his culpability, Dr. Aluthge said.
The GMOA had emphasized that Prof. Gunaratne?s appointment will severely affect the independence of the SLMC and will also influence the Appeal Court hearing into the SAITM issue.
Therefore, the GMOA had asked the government to reconsider its decision to appoint Prof. Gunaratne, which, according to them would do irreparable harm to the country, its citizens and the healthcare sector as a whole. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

Mahendran questioned on conflict of interest as Son-in-law was a primary dealer
	
Additional Solicitor General Dappula De Livera yesterday questioned former CBSL Governor Arjuna Mahendran on whether he had conveyed information relating to the Government?s immediate fund requirement of Rs. 15 billion to Aloysius, since PTL?s total bid at the February 27, 2015 auction was a ?magical figure? similar to the Government?s requirement.
Continuing the cross-examination of Former Central Bank Governor Arjuna Mahendran, Additional Solicitor General Dappula De Livera yesterday questioned the witness for the second day after a break of on week of the Presidential Commission of Inquiry (PCoI) proceedings.
At the very beginning, ASG DeLivera questioned the witness on the appointment of the CBSL Governor in January 2015 and the legally bound oath that had to be administered before assuming duties in the position.
It was said that Mr. Mahendran had not taken an oath as the Governor of CBSL at his appointment in January 2015.
ASG De Livera was of the view that section 164 of the Constitution requires the person who was about to hold the position of CBSL Governor should take an oath.
However, Mr. Mahendran replied that he was unaware about that law.
?Are you pleading ignorance of the constitutional provision?? ASG De Livera asked.
Mr. Mahendran said: ?It was not ignorance. I was never asked to do so and was told that there was no necessity?
ASG De Livera was of the view that it was a mandatory requirement of a person who was serving in a corporation and the oath would reflect on serving the country faithfully.
ASG De Livera: I suggest to you that you never took an oath. And it was a grave omission with regard to the post you held in the country
Witness: Can?t answer on that.
ASG: You had no intention of serving the country but only yourself and the son-in-law.
Witness: Completely disagree.
ASG De Livera thereafter moved to the February 27, 2015 incident and questioned again about the auction process.
ASG De Livera: You walked into the Public Debt Department (PDD) twice on that day. And on the second visit to the PDD, you came with two other Deputy Governors (Dr Weerasinghe and Ananda Silva). So you called them didn?t you?
W: It was a collective decision to go to the PDD
ASG: These two Deputy Governors gave evidence before this Commission in contradiction to your stance and would there be any reason for them to lie?
W: That I don?t know. I didn?t call them. It was a collective decision.
It was revealed that Mr. Mahendran, Dr. Weerasinghe (Dep. Gov.), Ananda Silva (Dep. Gov.), Mrs. Muthugala (Superintendent of PDD), Dr Aasim and Ms. Srimali (official of PDD) were present at the PDD when the decision was discussed regarding the auction around 12.30 pm on February 27, 2015 after the auction floor was closed.
ASG De Livera was of the view that Dr. Aasim and Mr. Mahendran had an argument with regard to the acceptance volume of the bids. ASG Livera said that Dr Aasim had informed Mr. Mahendran about the PDD?s recommendation of only Rs. 2.6 billion to be accepted from the auction.
Mr. Mahendran however said that there was no argument took place at that moment and it was only a counter proposal of Rs. 2.6 billion to be raised through the auction and rest of the money to be raised through Direct Placement Method. (fund requirement of the time was amounting to Rs. 13.5 billion by March 2)
?I was skeptical about the PDD?s capacity. So, I said if I were you I would have accepted Rs.10.05 billion from the auction and walked away. It was a civil argument?, Mahendran said.
It was explained that after the suggestion by Mr. Mahendran, the PDD had prepared another option sheet recommending Rs. 10 billion to the Tender Board (TB), where the final approval would be given before the Governor?s signature.
After a series of questions, ASG Livera suggested to the witness that he had directed the PDD to first accept Rs. 20 billion and after the discussion at the PDD, he reduced that amount to Rs. 10 billion.
However, witness Mahendran said he never directed the PDD to do so, because he had only made the suggestion to the PDD considering the huge government fund requirement at that time.
ASG De Livera: PDD made a recommendation of Rs. 10 billion to suit your direction, right?
W: Disagree
ASG: You prevented PDD officials from making an independent recommendation to the Tender Board and you prevented them making a recommendation of Rs. 2.6 billion, which they considered as appropriate, right?
W: I never prevented them
ASG: The recommendation (Rs. 10 billion) of yours sent to the Tender Board had no economic basis, wasn?t it?
W: Disagree.
At this moment, Justice Prasanna Jayawardena questioned the witness.
Justice Prasanna Jyawardena: You became aware about the PDD recommendation of Rs. 2.6 billion after visiting the PDD for the second time, right?
Witness: Yes. Dr Asim told me about it holding an option sheet.
J: Subsequently, another option sheet had been prepared recommending Rs. 10 billion which is similar to your suggestion or the direction as the ASG said.
W: Yes
J: The second option sheet (Rs. 10 billion) which replaced the Rs. 2.6 billion option sheet was precisely what you suggested to the PDD, right?
W: I can?t say precisely on the first option sheet and can?t say the option sheet reflect someone?s view.
Justice Chitrasiri at this moment asked: The PDD would have recommended only Rs. 2.6 billion if you wouldn?t have suggested such an amount, right?
Witness went on to explain what made him to suggest Rs. 10 billion in the backdrop of the Government?s urgent fund requirement.
Justice Jayawardena: There was an option sheet recommending Rs. 2.6 by the PDD and another option sheet thereafter recommending Rs. 10.05 billion, which coincide with your suggestion, right?
W: Yes
ASG Dappula De Livera: You initially suggested to the PDD to accept Rs. 20 billion (all bids at the auction) without knowing or verifying the rates at which the bids had been placed at the auction.
W: I only asked, can we take Rs. 20 billion.
ASG: You went there with the sole purpose of accepting Rs. 20 billion at any cost and you were not considered about the rate but only at fixing the auction.
Witness Mahendran completely rejected that stance.
It was explained that after the discussion at the PDD around 12.30pm on February 27, 2015, Mr. Mahendran had visited his daughter?s residence at Flower Road to have lunch and had returned around 2.00 p.m.
It was revealed that at this moment the Tender Board (TB) meeting had taken place regarding the bond auction at the CBSL and Mr. P. Samarasiri had chaired it.
During the deliberations of the meeting Mr. Samarasiri had telephoned Mr. Mahendran questioning about the situation and at that moment the witness said he was in the car.
?Mr. Samarasiri said that TB members indicated to him about the suggestion made by me regarding the acceptance of Rs. 10 billion. So I told him about the reasons that made me take that decision?, the witness said.
The witness while explaining said that there was a miscalculation by the PDD with regard to the thirty year bond appetite in the market and that made him suggest to accept Rs. 20 billion.
ASG De Livera: So, you told him to take Rs. 10 billion?
Witness: I didn?t direct him. I told that it was reasonable.
When questioned, the witness was of the view that Mr. P. Samarasiri had not conveyed to him about any disagreement among the members of the Tender Board over the acceptance of Rs. 10 billion nor conveyed about the request made by the members seeking an immediate meeting with the Governor.
ASG Dappula De Livera: I suggest to you that Mr. P. Samarasiri and you connived to prevent the Tender Board members from changing the decision.
Witness totally rejected that stance.
ASG De Livera thereafter moved the questioning to a new area and asked about the governments Rs. 75 billion fund requirement discussed at a meeting held on February 26, 2015 with Ministers Ravi Karunanayake, Kabeer Hashim, Prime Minister?s Advisor at that time Malik Samarawickrame and other RDA officials.
However, the witness also explained to the Commission about an immediate Rs. 15 billion fund requirement which was discussed at that meeting on February 26, 2015.
At this moment, ASG De Livera intensively objecting to the witness? stance said that he had never mentioned about a Rs. 15 billion fund requirement in his previous testimony. The ASG was of the view that it was he who drew the attention over the remark made by the Prime Minister in Parliament on March 2015, stating about a funding requirement of Rs. 15 billion.
ASG De Livera was of the view that earlier the witness had stated about an urgent fund requirement of Rs. 75 billion and had submitted documentary evidence in a letter given by the then Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake, to the Commission which reflects a Rs. 75 billion money requirement.
The ASG said that even the then Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake had not mentioned about a Rs. 15 billion urgent requirement before the Commission. ASG De Livera said the witness was contradicting his own evidence at the moment.
However, Mr. Mahendran said there was a halt in road development projects at that time due to funding issues and at the February 26 meeting the ?economic research department? officials had suggested a Rs. 15 billion requirement to start those paused projects immediately.
Justice Prasanna Jyawardena questioned at this moment: However that was the funding requirement for the March of 2015 and not an immediate requirement in February 2015, right?
Witness: Yes
ASG Dappula De Livera questioning the witness suggested that there was no single word reflected in the statement given by the witness to the first COPE (D.E.W. Gunasekara) regarding such an urgent fund requirement.
ASG: You did not utter a single word about an urgent fund requirement to this COPE?
W: I have to check about that.
ASG: You had mentioned about neither a Rs. 15 billion nor a Rs. 75 billion urgent requirement any time in 2015, right? There was no such requirement. Your testimony is false.
W: Can?t answer that without checking.
It was revealed that a Cabinet sub committee meeting took place on February 24, 2015 in the presence of Mr. Mahendran, the Prime Minister, Ravi Karunanayake, Kabeer Hashim, Dr Harha de Silva, Saman Ekanayake, Dr Samaratunge (Secretary to the Treasury) and other RDA officials, where matters relating to road development projects were also discussed.
ASG De Livera submitting the minutes of that meeting said: ?These minutes say that all RDA projects should be prioritized with the available funds. So there was no decision taken at that meeting regarding an urgent fund requirement?
However, the witness was of the view that the minutes would not state what was exactly discussed at the meeting.
At this moment ASG De Livera brought out the minutes of another meeting held at Temple Trees with the same people on March 3, 2015. He said that even in that meeting such urgent fund requirement for RDA projects had not been discussed.
The ASG was of the view that the witness was unable to support his stance with other evidence except the document provided as AM 22, which was given to him by the then Finance Minister verifying the holding of a meeting on February 26, 2015.
After a short adjournment of yesterday?s proceedings, ASG De Livera questioned Mr. Mahendran again about the urgent fund requirement of Rs. 15 billion.
ASG De Livera: This Rs. 15 billion is a magical figure wasn?t it?
W: Can?t see any magic in it.
ASG: At the February 27 auction, it was only Rs. 1 billion that was advertised and somehow your son-in-law?s company bid 15 times more than the advertised amount, right?
W: Yes
ASG: So, Aloysius received 50% of the accepted bids (Rs. 10.05 billion)
W: Yes
ASG: And PTL had bid 15 billion at the auction, which is 75% of the total bids, right?
W: Yes
ASG: So, don?t you think this Rs. 15 billion is a magical figure?
W: No
ASG: As a stand alone Primary Dealer, how would he have this information?
W: I can?t answer for him
ASG: Would you consider this practice as unusual of a primary dealer?
W: I told this earlier also. PTL would have gone bankrupt if all of the Rs. 15 billion were accepted.
ASG: So, Rs. 5 billion of PTL was ultimately accepted at the auction. When compared with the track record of PTL it was a lifetime achievement, wasn?t it?
W: I don?t know about lifetime achievement. That was well within the permitted regulatory amounts.
ASG: Have you given a gift to Arjun Aloysius by providing price sensitive information?
W: No
At this moment President?s Counsel Romesh De Silva observed that the ASG was denying about a requirement of a Rs. 15 billion at one point but contrary to that again he questioned about the Rs. 15 billion requirement relating to the Auction.
However, ASG De Livera said that the Commission was in the process of revealing the truth, so that he needs to question the witness.
During this questioning it was also revealed that there was a Criminal investigation initiated by the Criminal Investigation?s Department as well on the Bond issue.
When questioned it was also revealed that Mr. Mahendran in his capacity as the Governor had never initiated an internal inquiry regarding the February 27, 2015 auction. According to the witness, when the ?Pitipana Committee? was appointed by the Prime Minister to scrutinize the incident Mr. Mahendran had voluntarily kept away from his position until the investigation was over.
ASG De Livera and the Commission thereafter questioned the witness regarding the decision to stop the use of the ?Direct Placement Method?.
According to the witness, the Prime Minister had been instructing him to have a transparent process in CBSL matters since his appointment as the Governor in January, 2015.
Mr. Mahendran said he interpreted that this transparency should include the procurement process at the CBSL as well.
The witness said yesterday that on February 24, 2015, the Prime Minister precisely advised him to stop direct placement and raise funds through public auctions only.
And thereafter, on February 27, 2015, 12.30 p.m. Mr. Mahendran had decided to stop raising money through the direct placement method and told the PDD to accept funds only through public auctions, after the February 27 auction floor was closed. This auction was however, initially advertised for only Rs. 1 billion and the raising of other money was expected to be done through direct placements.
During a series of questions, Justice Prasanna Jayawardena asked the witness: Be careful of facts of your evidence. According to you the Prime Minister wanted public auctions in so many words, right?
W: Yes
Justice Jayawardena: And you conveyed this to the PDD on February 27, 2015?
W: Yes
J: Did the Prime Minister tell you about the complaints received by him from Primary Dealers regarding Direct Placements?
W: Yes
J: Who were those Primary Dealers?
W: That I didn?t know
The witness was of the view that he was told by the Prime Minister at the meeting held on February 24, 2015 to stop the direct placement method.
It was revealed that there was a Monetary Board meeting on February 23, 2015 and another on March 6, 2015.
It was said that in order to implement the policy decision to stop the Direct Placement method, it had to go through the Monetary Broad.
However, on this occasion, Mr. Mahendran had decided about stopping direct placements on February 27, 2015 and then obtained the approval of the Monetary Board later on March 6, 2015.
ASG De Livera questioning the witness contested that there was no decision taken by the Monetary Board with regard to the Direct Placement method on March 6, 2015.
However, the witness was of the view that there was no objection raised at that meeting held on March 6 and rejected the ASG?s stance saying that there was another occasion in June, 2015 where, the Monetary Board did not re-instate the Direct Placement method.
At this point, Justice Prasanna Jayawardena questioned the witness.
Justice Jayawardena: You have said that you and the Prime Minister were having discussions over the removal of the Direct Placement method?
W: Yes
J: So, why didn?t you discuss about that at the Monetary Board meeting held on February 23?
Witness was silent for a while and said ?Yes I did not talk about it at that meeting?
During Justice Jayawardena?s further questioning it was revealed that the witness had provided information to the Prime Minister continuously regarding shortfalls of the Direct Placement Method and then based on that instruction, the Prime Minister had decided to stop DPM on February 24, 2015.
However, ASG De Livera also submitting the Minutes of the February 24, 2015 cabinet sub committee meeting said that the minutes reflect no decision regarding the Direct Placement Method at that meeting.
The witness said ?Minutes are very sketchy. I would say that what transpired at the meeting are not reflected in the minutes?
?You are lying again?, ASG said
?I?m not?, said the witness.
ASG: According to your evidence, you were privy to this information (about the stoppage of Direct Placement Method) from February 24, 2015, right?
W: Yes
ASG: And the auction was held on February 27, 2015, right?
W: Yes
ASG: Would it be correct to say that it was you who conveyed this vital information to Arjun Aloysius before the auction?
W: Not at all.
ASG: And that information enabled Aloysius to succeed in the auction.
W: Totally disagree. I would not have done such a foolish thing destroying my carrier after having an experience in the field for years.
ASG: You never expected to testify before this Commission, wouldn?t you?
W: Since my appointment, I was well aware about this issue and therefore I had to work always in arms length with Aloysius. I never discussed matters with my Son-in-law.
ASG: You, daughter and son-in-law, Aloysius, lived in the same house at flower road, right?
W: Yes
ASG: So, when did you got your appointment as the Governor?
W: January 23,2015
ASG: At that time Aloysius was the CEO of Perpetual Treasuries Ltd, right?
W: That I didn?t know
ASG: Don?t you know about what your Son-in-law does (asked in a sarcastic manner)
W: No
After a series of questions, the witness said that he was unaware about the ownership of the companies relating to the PTL but knew about who were running the Company.
ASG: Aloysius resigned from his position as the CEO on January 16, 2015, and that is well before your appointment right?
W: He told me something to that effect. Even though my appointment was given on January 23, it was communicated to me a week before.
ASG: That was not known to the General Public. So, how would Aloysius have known it?
W: I would have told them
ASG: You told him, right?
W: Yes
ASG De Livera in a sarcastic manner quipped at this moment that ?it tells that you have been telling him things quite earlier since January 2015?
The witness was of the view that considering the potential conflict of interest between Aloysius and him, he maintained an arms length distance in his CBSL matters with Aloysius as there was also speculation in Media with regard to that interest at that time.
ASG: Why did Aloysius resign from PTL?
W: That I can?t answer.
ASG: So, considering the potential conflict of interest, why didn?t you decline the position as the Governor?
W: I talked about this matter with others too and subject to the proviso that I would do my activities keeping an arms length, I continued.
ASG: So, the Prime Minister agreed to your stance and continued with the post, having known the conflict of interest, right?
W: Not only the PM other Ministers also agreed to it.
ASG: So, having known the fact that you would have to approve the Tender Board decisions on bids and having known the fact that you would be the regulatory supervisor regarding the bond auction, you still continued to hold the position as the Governor?
W: Despite the conflict of interest, I practiced the arms length distance in my activities as the Governor of CBSL.
ASG: Show us what your arms length would be like.
Witness raised his hand and the court room burst out in laughter.
Justice Prasanna Jayawardena at this moment made an observation in relation to the revelation that transpired during the previous proceedings.
Justice Jayawardena considering that two wrong doings don?t? make it right, said that there was also an incident where former Governor Cabral?s sister happened to be a director of PTL in 2014.
The Justice also said that this has happened in the past and that past practice should not be an excuse for what happens in the future.
Justice Jayawardena also quipped: ?Wonder whether Nivard Cabral and his sister lived in the same house too?
Questioning the witness on his relationship with Aloysius, ASG De Livera questioned the witness whether he had ever disclosed about the relationship to the CBSL. The ASG was of the view that Mr. Mahendran had not disclosed it to the Monetary Board or the CBSL and the witness said that he could prove that he did.
Justice Jayawardena finally asked the witness.
J: You saw potential conflict of interest, right?
W: Yes
J: And maintained an arms length due to that
W: Yes
J: Despite all other things, do you think it was appropriate to live in the same house with Aloysius, who was a primary dealer.
W: Yes. I never consider it bad, because in my family we don?t talk about such matters with each other.
When Justice Jayawardena asked about comparable incidents where he and his family ever worked with potential conflict of interest, earlier the witness was of the view that when he was working at the HSBC bank in Singapore his daughter was an analyst in an investment company while his son was an employee at the KPMG audit firm.
Justice Jayawardena: Are you really telling that these two instances are comparable to living with a Primary Dealer while being the Governor of CBSL?
W: Yes
At the end of the yesterday?s proceedings Justice Jayawardena observed that the Commission was concerned about the time constraints and therefore would like to finish its proceedings by next week considering the importance of writing the report. (Shehan Chamika Silva)

Mastercard arms issuers with predictive tool to combat account related fraud from data breaches
	
?
With speed being a critical factor in fighting fraud, Mastercard announced the launch of Early Detection System.
This new service provides issuers with a unique advanced alert for cards and accounts at a heightened risk of fraudulent use based on their exposure in security incidents or data breaches.
The business of stolen data is in the news daily and thieves are getting faster every day. Just last month, 143 million identities were reported as compromised in one data breach, and it can take as little as nine minutes for stolen data posted to the dark web to be used. Knowing that not all compromised accounts will be used fraudulently, and every second counts, Mastercard developed Early Detection System to help financial institutions take action faster, thus preempting more serious attacks.
Using Mastercard network insights, predictive capabilities and a combination of internal and external data sources, Early Detection System determines if a card or account is at risk and sends an alert to the issuer with a quantification of the level of risk. The issuer then uses the level of risk to more accurately prioritize what action to take - from monitoring transactions more closely to proactively issuing a replacement card. ?Knowledge is power, and this service helps issuers act significantly faster and with greater precision to stop potential fraud before it occurs,? said Mastercard Enterprise Risk and Security President Ajay Bhalla. ?Our issuers can now proactively target the fraudulent activity resulting from previously breached or hacked data, helping them reduce costs and maintain the best possible cardholder experience.?? Early Detection System is available to issuers globally and captures all types of fraud across all transaction channels. The system identifies everything from active criminal trading of account data, to identification of cards being tested prior to being used for fraud, to account data that appears at-risk but without sufficient evidence to declare an Account Data Compromise event. This provides issuers with alerts on a much broader set of at-risk accounts potentially six to 18 months ahead of traditional alerts.

Myanmar refugees- Dissatisfied with the police action: Sagala
	
Law and Order Minister Sagala Ratnayaka said yesterday he was dissatisfied with the manner in which the police acted during the recent incident in Mount Lavinia where a group of Myanmar refugees was allegedly harassed by a group of protesters including several monks.
He said this when he met Divisional SSPs and ASPs at Temple Trees and reminded the Police that they were responsible for maintaining law and order and ensuring peace.
"About 95 % of the police personnel perform their duties to the best of their abilities but the remaining 5% have been found wanting not because of a fault of the government. If an officer acts in a manner that favours a politician or some other person then issues arise," he said.
The minister discussed several recent incidents including the one that took place in Mount Lavinia and the accident where his vehicle was hit by a another vehicle on the Southern Expressway.
"Instead of searching for the vehicle which hit my vehicle, my vehicle was taken to the police. If this is how police treat me, how can the people have faith in the police? " he asked. (Darshana Sanjeewa)

1,333 refugees, asylum seekers in the country: Minister
	
While claiming that the group of 35 Myanmar refugees would be sent to third country, the Government today revealed that a total of 1,333 asylum seekers and refugees were residing in the country under the protection of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).
Addressing the media at the weekly media briefing today at the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) Head Quarters Ports and Shipping Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe said according to an MoU signed between the UNHCR and the Government, the Myanmar refugees should be sent to a third country as soon as possible.
The Minister pointed out that Sri Lanka was not a party to the 1951 Refugee Convention and because of that and the country could not take any responsibility based on the convention.
?But according to the international law countries should approach this kind issue with a humane aspect. India worked to provide temporary facilities for refugees. Though we did not sign the 1951 Refugee Convention we have worked to provide facilities for refugees since 2008,? The Minister said.
He said the refugees who came to Sri Lanka in 2008, 2012, 2013 and 2014 had been sent to third countries such as the US and Canada for permanent residence through the intervention of the UNHCR.
?Those countries expressed willingness to grant residency to refugee as part of the UNHCR Convention,? he said.
?The Myanmar refugees, who recently came to the country, were from a camp in South India but not from Myanmar. The boat was captured by the Sri Lankan Navy after they entered to the Sri Lankan waters. Later the refugees were handed over to the UNHCR as usual since 2008.
?After handing over the refugees to the UNHCR the Sri Lankan Government is not in a bond to provide facilities for them. All infrastructure facilities should be provided by the UNHCR.
?There are 728 refugees in the country as at August 31 this year- such as 113 from Afghanistan, 7 from Iran, 8 from Maldives, 35 from Myanmar, 533 from Pakistan, 10 from Palestine, 1 from Somalia, 14 from Syria, 1 from Tunisia and 6 from Yemen.
?The UNHCR had taken the responsibly to send these people to a third country.
?If the people in society know the true story behind the refugee situation in the country they would not have acted like extremists,? Minister Samarasinghe said. (Chaturanga Pradeep)

Sarath N. Silva?s petition challenged
	
The petition filed by former Chief Justice Sarath Nanda Silva in the Supreme Court, was challenged by Unawatuna Koswattage Aruna Laksiri of Padukka Handapangoda claiming that the former Chief Justice?s petition is prima facially faulty.
He has requested the Supreme Court not to grant relief sought in the petition and to dismiss it.
The intervening petitioner claimed that 225 Parliamentarians elected by the people represented the sovereignty of the people and the petitioner Silva who had filed the petition had not taken notice of that fact.
He alleged that Sarath N. Silva by the petition had erroneously cited Article 3 and Article 4 of the Constitution in order to execute the Sovereignty of the people erroneously.
The intervening petitioners also allege that Sarath Nanda Silva had attempted to destabilize the legislative power vested on the Parliament by Articles 75 and 76 of the Constitution.
He asserted that Mr. Silva?s request to the Judiciary to enforce its vested Fundamental rights powers on the Parliament is an attempt to control/ to tame or to take precedence to the existing legislative powers of the Parliament and an attempt to prevail over the legislative powers of parliament.
The intervening petitioner further alleges that naming the Speaker of the Parliament as the second respondent to the petition was a violation of the Powers and privileges of Parliament.
The Petition claims that the petition was bad in law since Sarath Nanda Silva had violated Sections 126,17,19,11, 12,13 and 14 of the Constitution by naming the Speaker as a respondent to the petition although the speaker was protected by the constitution from being naming as a respondent for all actions done in Parliament.
The intervening petitioner also state that there are limits for the Supreme Court to act on the legislative powers vested on the parliament and no other power is vested on the Supreme Court to act further than those limits.
The intervening petitioner pleads to dismiss the petition of Sarath Nanda De Silva claiming that if the court consent to hear that petition it would generate a conflict between the Parliament and the Judiciary as the Petition was in opposition to the Constitution of the Country.

The Jathika Hela Urumaya (JHU) said today Sri Lanka's ?Unitary? character should remain unchanged.
General Secretary and Minister, Patali Champika Ranawaka said their party was against the interpretation given on the ?State of Sri Lanka' in the Constitutional Reforms Steering Committee Report.
"The provincial council system has damaged the unitary character to some extent. However, we firmly believe that the article pertaining to the Unitary character and the Clauses 4 (1) and 76 (1) of the current Constitution should not be changed,? he told a news briefing.
Although some political parties alleged that the foremost status given to Buddhism had been challenged in the steering committee report, the minister said, to begin with, no special status had been given to any specific religion even in the existing Constitution.
?Article 9 which relates to Buddhism has not been properly interpreted. This particular Article has not given special privileges or special treatment to Buddhism. Whatever is mentioned is just a decoration. However, If attempts are being made to remove that ?decorative? status, we are against it. No matter what, Buddhism is a part of our heritage. No harm has befallen other religions because of the peaceful nature of Buddhism. This Article should also remain unchanged,? he said.
The minister said Presidential Powers should not be pruned any further. ?The new Constitution should only be made with the consent of all stakeholders. We must make sure that the new Constitution will ensure the country's stability and its democracy,? he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

America is reeling from the worst mass shooting in its history after at least 58 people were killed and more than 515 wounded at a country music festival in Las Vegas on Sunday night.? ?
The shooting broke out on the final night of the three-day Route 91 Harvest festival, a sold-out event attended by 22,000 and featuring top acts such as Eric Church, Sam Hunt and Jason Aldean. Police say the shooter was 64-year-old Stephen Craig Paddock, a resident of nearby Mesquite, Nevada, who opened fire on the festival taking place at Las Vegas Village from a room across the street in the Mandalay Bay Hotel at 10:08pm.? ?
?
Clark County Sheriff Joseph Lombardo said that his officers breached Paddock?s room on the 32nd floor and found Paddock had committed suicide inside, among an ?arsenal? of 10 firearms. Lombardo said that Paddock shot himself. Investigators are now raiding Paddock?s home in a retirement community in Mesquite, which he shared with a woman named Marilou Danley. Danley was initially called a person of interest in the shooting, but police no longer believe she was involved after contacting her early Monday morning and finding her out of the country.? ?
Lombardo said investigations are still ongoing and police have not yet determined a motive. He was not believed to be connected to any militant group, Lombardo said.?

Were they staging an act?
	
?
A onetime leading political heavyweight called on a political pal ? a loser at the last general polls -- at the latter?s residence for a friendly chat the other day. On arrival there, he was in for a big surprise and a bigger puzzle -- the pal was having a good time with his long estranged wife.
?
The former political authority never expected to meet his pal?s former wife because the couple had separated after a bitter fight and had been living separately for several years. Soon after his arrival at his friend?s house, the latter?s former wife residing in a house in the same locality had come over there to get a typical lover?s welcome from her estranged husband. Thereafter, the former political stalwart got hardly any time to chat to his pal because the duo had begun behaving like a couple of love birds --? cooing, laughing and?taking selfies.
The former political authority is said to be still wondering whether the couple had finally made it up or were staging an act, they say.??

Wetlands are not wastelands
	
The incremental economic value of conserving the wetlands, need to be closely?looked at.?
	Substantial funds are required to address threats, pressures, and to enforce controls on land and resource uses as well as manage the Wetlands and its valuable resources.
?
The Institute of Environment Professionals Sri Lanka (IEPSL) is holding its Annual General Meeting today (October 3) at the SLLRDC managed Bio Diversity Park, which is located closer to Thalawathugoda, behind Parliament. At this AGM the selected theme of the IEPSL is Rescuing Wetlands For Economic Development. This article is published to highlight the values of wetlands and contribution towards economy in?
Sri Lanka.??
In considering the economic development of the country, it is also essential to pay an attention on the contribution towards national economy provided by component of wetlands and thereby conduct an assessment on those components of wetlands which forms vitally important, but often neglected. It is very clear that very little work has been carried out on developing and applying economic assessment process to wetlands.? ?
An understanding of the economic status of wetlands is however critical for planning for their wise use and sustainable management. If at all a proper valuation and assessment need to be carried out, biological, ecological and hydrological contribution to the economy as well as to the environment that could be relatively well-established. In that sense wetlands typically have a high economic value. However, economic forces underlie wetland degradation and loss, and wetland conservation often requires a range of economic management responses with greater interventions.??

An understanding of the economic status of wetlands is however critical for planning for their wise use and sustainable management. If at all a proper valuation and assessment need to be carried out, biological, ecological and hydrological contribution to the economy as well as to the environment that could be relatively well-established. In that sense wetlands typically have a high economic value.
?
Initially, let us think of the effect that the assessment methodology to compare ?with wetland? and ?without wetland? a scenario, indicating what wetland conservation adds to economic output and welfare as compared to the next most likely alternative land use (Reclamation for settlement and industry).Within the context of wise use principles, wetland conservation is considered to include the uses of wetland and resources to generate for economic benefits. Since there are no proper attention to assess functions of wetlands, limited information is however available as to the sustainability of current resource uses, and the ability of the wetland to continue natural process of filtering and cleaning the existing waste loads.? ?
In considering the other aspects in view of the economic valuation, that the wetlands are currently able to effectively attenuate flooding, providing firewood, fisheries and limited agricultural production are also a valuable natural resources need to be considered and essentially to be kept within sustainable levels. Accordingly wetland benefits could be categorized as:??
Direct benefits: Economic values yielded by the physical use of wetland resources and? ecosystems for production and consumption (For example fishery, tourism, firewood).??
Economic benefits associated with the direct use of wetland resources such as fishing and tourism are most prominent values. Most of the wetlands are provided or facilitated for popular recreational destination for urban dwellers and foreign tourists.??
Indirect benefits: Economic values yielded by wetland environmental services and eco system functions and services (Example nutrient retention, micro-climate regulation, flood attenuation, wastewater treatment, water supply and ground water recharge, fish breeding and nursery, landscape value, carbon sink).??
Mangroves provide nursery habitat for many wildlife species, including commercial fish and crustaceans, and thus contribute to sustaining the local abundance of fish and shellfish populations. There are hundreds of fauna and flora species recorded in many wetlands showing the valuable diversity.??
Optional benefits: The economic valuation placed on maintaining wetland species and ecosystems for future possible economic uses, some of which may not be known now (Example development for pharmaceutical (medicinal plants), industrial (minerals), agricultural, innovative and value addition) applications, values placed on possible future uses and applications such as: Future tourism development, future commercial applications of wild plants, species and genes).??
Existing benefits: Intrinsic values attached to the existence of wetland species and ecosystems, regardless of actual use (For example, aesthetic, national heritage, cultural significance, leisure, recreation and education and research? significance).??
The simplest and most straightforward way of valuing wetland goods and services is to look at their market prices - what they cost to buy or what they are worth to sell.?
For example, Muthurajawela/ Negombo lagoon, market price-based valuation techniques could be applied to the economic benefits associated with annual fish production worth of some billions of Rupees, agricultural and plant-based handicraft production activities in the marsh area worth of another millions of rupees based on the calculation on livelihood of the people living in the vicinity of wetlands. (These valuations are estimated many studies such as Muthurajawela and Negombo lagoon, Madu Ganga etc.)??
However, often the case with environmental goods and services, many of the economic benefits associated with wetlands have no market price, or are subject to prices that are highly distorted. In these cases a range of alternative valuation techniques could, in principle, be applied:?
Effects on production: The life support provided as inputs by those wetlands ecosystem and other economic processes often rely on wetland resources have to be given much concerns. Where they have a market, it is possible to value wetland goods and services in terms of their contribution to the output or income of those other production and consumption opportunities.??
For the case of effects on production techniques could be used to assess the economic value of wetland wastewater treatment services and provision of fish breeding and nursery habitat functions in terms of their contribution to downstream fisheries- in the lagoon system specially, where there are sea grasses as well as mangroves.??
Replacement costs: Even where wetland goods and services have no market themselves, they often have alternatives or substitutes that can be bought and sold. This replacement costs can be used as a proxy for the value of wetland goods and services, although usually represent only partial estimates, or under-estimates.? ?
For the case of all wetlands replacement costs could be used to assess the value of flood retention in terms of artificial infrastructure required to provide a similar level of services.??
Wetlands also have a function in mitigating, reducing or avoiding damages to the environment during adverse situations, such as Tsunami and other ad worse environmental impacts. If closely monitor or assess the value where situation to avoid damage costs due to carbon sequestration in terms of climate change-related damage costs which could be avoided in view of the services of Wetlands. Mangroves roots support to purify effluent and retain sediments and are functionally linked to neighbouring coastal ecosystems safeguarding coral reefs.??
On the other hand what are other scenarios to be considered as Mitigative or avertive expenditures? It is almost always necessary to take action to mitigate or avert the negative effects of the loss to the environment goods and services, so as to avoid economic costs. For example, the value of wastewater treatment and ground water recharge services, value of fresh water storage etc. in terms of alternative expenditures could be avoided with the wetland natural functions.??
Ensuring that wetland conservation generates tangible economic benefits to both national income and people in the local areas through uses of its valuable resources:??
There are numerous threats to wetland considering it as a ?waste lands? and try to utilise or exploit as place for dumping or reclamation, discharging waste and waste water and chemicals with many harmful substances.??
Substantial funds are required to address threats, pressures, and to enforce controls on land and resource uses as well as manage the Wetlands and its valuable resources.? ?
Currently there are few funds or no funds available to undertake that tasks or to extend an adequate level of protection to the wetland.?
To ensure that the public sector agencies and private individuals who profit from wetland goods and services and are able to pay for those use are charged fair prices. If they are retained and allocated at the site level, such revenues can provide an important source of funding for the conservation of this valuable natural asset. Also it is necessary to mention that modern marketing strategies along with sustainable management and conservation strategies based biodiversity park concept can be implemented in generating funds which is called Wise use of Wetlands.?
