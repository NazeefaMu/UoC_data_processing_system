Arjuna urges President, PM to dissolve Cricket Board
	
Ports and Shipping Minister Arjuna Ranatunga today urged President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe to dissolve the Cricket Board (CB) with immediate effect and appoint an Interim Committee under him.
Minister Ranatunga said he had no clue at all as to who was the Sports Minister as Sports Minister did not take decisions on cricket right now and added when an interim committee was in charge of cricket, no one could pilfer money from cricket.
We have brought cricket in Sri Lanka to a position which we can be proud of. If we are to save the most popular and widespread sport in the country, we must relieve it from bookies. The best strategy available to us to put an end to the current mess in cricket is to dissolve the CB and appoint an Interim Committee. I am ready to take the leadership of this endevour, for the sake of national cricket of our country, Minister Ranatunga said.
Minister Ranatrunga said cricket in Sri Lanka was in its lowest ebb and something has to be done to prevent further deterioration of it. "I have appraised President Sirisena and Prime Minister Wickremesinghe and ready to face the challenge with a new team of management," he said.
Addressing the media after giving a statement to the Human Rights Commission following his complaint on the behaviour of Director General of Sports during the cricket board election, Minister Ranatunga added that applications for the Cricket Board election in January had been accepted violating the clauses 13,14 and 15 of the sports law and 11-F5 chapter of the Constitution of Sri Lanka Cricket. The action of the DG Sports had violated his rights and hence the complaint to the HRCSL, he said.
Minister Ranatunga said: "The current Cricket Board attempts to develop cricket in the country by bringing jockeys like Lester Piggott. I have heard that pictures of Piggott have replaced our pictures on the walls of the CB. But no one could swindle money when an interim committee is established."
He said he also served in the interim committee for about a year and never let any one to rip off the cricket fund.
He charged that those who supported the current members of the cricket board at the January election had been given positions at the board who did not have any knowledge in cricket and that had led to the erosion of cricket in the country. (Sandun A Jayasekera)

The Government Medical Officers' Association (GMOA) today filed a complaint with the Bribery and Corruption Commission against the Health Ministry for allowing students of South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) in Malabe to undergo clinical training at government hospitals.
GMOA Secretary Dr. Nalinda Herath said the Secretary to the Health Ministry has allowed a misuse of public property by allowing a private institution and its students who are not qualified to study as medical students to involve in operations in a state hospital.
We believe that the Secretary to the Health Ministry Anura Jayawickrama has acted in such a manner which is causing a serious loss to the State whilst giving SAITM which is a private organisation an unlawful and unjust gain out of public resources, the GMOA told Ms. Dilrukshi Dias Wickramasinghe, the Director General of Bribery and Corruption Commission.
While noting that the decision of the ministry is an offence in terms of Section 70 of the Bribery Act, the GMOA had requested the DG to inquire into this matter.
They had also claimed that large scale financial loss is caused and is continuing to be caused to the State as a result of the health ministrys arbitrary decision.

HDFC Bank achieves strong performance in 2015
	
Housing Development Finance Corporation Bank of Sri Lanka (HDFC Bank) has achieved a pre-tax profit of Rs. 972 million for the year ending December 31, 2015. This is a 25 percent increase over the previous years figure of Rs 777 million. The post-tax profit was Rs. 515 million compared to the Rs. 375 million achieved in 2014, an increase of 37 percent.
HDFC Bank CEO/General Manager Upali Hettiarachchi said: HDFC Banks strong performance in 2015 is a result of the many initiatives undertaken by the management during the year and the commitment of our staff. The growth in the SME sector has also contributed to the overall results and the bank is further taking steps in widening its customer baseby focusing on low and middle income segment.
The banks interest income also rose from Rs. 4,378 million in 2014 to Rs. 4,659 million recording a growth of 6.41 percent.  The net interest income rose from Rs.1, 843 million to Rs. 2,120 million, an increase of 15 percent, while fee-based income rose from Rs.211 million to
Rs 268 million an increase of27 percent.
HDFC Banks loan book grew to Rs. 26,688 million  by end 2015, an increase of 14.27 percent over the previous years figure of Rs. 23,357 million. The deposit base also increased from Rs. 24,479 million to Rs. 28, 593 million, an increase of 16.81 percent.
The bank also achieved a steady growth in its asset base, from Rs.34, 418 million to Rs. 41,417 million in 2015 a growth of 20.34 percent 
Commenting on the performance during the year the HDFC Bank Chairman R.J. De Silva said: I am very happy to note the performance of the bank and I believe the bank can remain a strong player in the Sri Lankan financial landscape. Prior to 2014, HDFCs business model was almost entirely housing finance based, which exposed the Bank to extremely high financial and market risks. After the amendments to the HDFC Act, the Bank began diversifying the product portfolio beyond housing finance. In 2015, we consolidated this process, which has contributed significantly towards mitigating our financial risk factors and towards improving our competitiveness. In fact, SMEs grew 61 percent in 2015 compared to 2014.
Due to high quality credit evaluation process, the bank experienced a slight decrease (excluding EPF backed loans) in NPL from 9.81 percent in 2014 to 8.26 percent. In gross non-performing loans (NPLs) decrease from 22.57 percent in 2014 to 20.77 percent last year.
The return on assets (ROA) (PBT) reached 2.56 percent compared to 2.51 percent in 2014, an increase of 0.05 percent, while the return on equity (ROE) rose from 13.72 percent to 16.45 percent, an increase of2.73 percent.
The bank met the capital adequacy requirements stipulated by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka. The T1 and T2 capital adequacy ratios
stand at 11.69 percent and 10.62 percent respectively as
against the regulatory requirements of 5 percent and 10 percent respectively. The bank also maintains a statutory liquid asset ratio of 35.03 percent as against
the regulatory requirementof 20 percent.
HDFC Banks strategy of diversifying its product portfolio has resulted in improved profitability. However, despite the extensive diversification exercise, the bank sustained its core business of housing, further enhancing its reach and opening its loan books for aspiring
home owners.
It was observed that when lower income customers applied for housing loans, they very often also require funding for their small-scale businesses. 
Recognizing this, the bank devised products to address both the housing and the business loan needs, thereby enabling them to enhance their living standards and encourage self-employment.
Last year, the bank opened 2 branches at Kiribathgoda and Polonnaruwa This expansion enabled the bank to strengthen its presence across the nation. The bank plans to further expand by opening
branches in Dambulla, Wellawatta, Negombo and Akuressa in 2016.

I know what to wear, when: Gammanpila
	
Commenting on his choice of attire during the Switzerland visit, MP Udaya Gammanpila today said he was not foolish enough to wear cotton cloths in a country like Switzerland, which had a colder weather.
He was responding to various charges that he attended the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) meeting in Geneva recently, dressed in smart casuals and not in the National Dress.
I will wear the National Dress at international events if Im representing the country. Otherwise, I wont wear it as it may not be the best choice of clothes, due to different climates. Just as it is not wise to wear a full suit with a tie in a tropical country like ours, its not wise to wear the cotton made National Dress in countries with colder weather. I wont make such unwise move, he told a news conference. 
Mr. Gammanpila said his luggage with clothes was not put into the flight, which flew from Doha, Qatar to Switzerland on time during his transit.
These kinds of things happen. There was not ample time for the air service to transfer the luggage. They have sent it to Geneva with the next flight on April 1, he said. 
He said he had to buy new cloths in Geneva to take part in the meeting with the IPU General Secretary on March 31. 
Those who criticise my choice of attire in Geneva and claim that I have deliberately misplaced the luggage, so I can wear trousers havent clearly travelled abroad, he said adding he didnt wear the National Dress everywhere. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Massive leak of tax documents expose cine stars, world leaders
	
A massive leak of 11.5 million documents has exposed the secret offshore dealings of late father of British Prime Minister David Cameron, world leaders and celebrities including Barcelonas Lionel Messi, Indias Amitabh Bachchan and his daughter-in-law Aishwarya Rai Bachchan .
An investigation by more than 100 media groups, described as one of the largest such probes in history, revealed the hidden offshore assets of around 140 political figures.
The vast stash of records was obtained from an anonymous source by German daily Sueddeutsche Zeitung and shared with media worldwide by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ).
The documents, from around 214,000 offshore entities covering almost 40 years, came from Mossack Fonseca, a Panama-based law firm with offices in more than 35 countries.
The investigations allege close associates of Putin, who is not himself named in the documents, secretly shuffled as much as $2 billion through banks and shadow companies.
Twelve current or former leaders are named in the investigations, including the prime minister of Pakistan, the president of Ukraine and the king of Saudi Arabia, as well as sporting and movie stars including Jackie Chan.
They allege Chinese President Xi Jinpings family has links to offshore accounts, as did the late father of British Prime Minister David Cameron, and claim Icelands premier secretly had millions invested in the countrys banks during the financial crisis.
Xi has led a high-profile anti-graft drive in China, targeting the excessive wealth accumulated by Communist Party cadres.
The leaked data features over 500 Indians linked to offshore firms.
Among those who figure on the list are film stars Amitabh Bachchan and his daughter-in-law Aishwarya Rai Bachchan, Delhi Land and Finance owner K P Singh and nine members of his family, promoters of Apollo Tyres and Indiabulls and business tycoon Gautam Adanis elder brother Vinod Adani.
Mumbais late gangster Iqbal Mirchi and two politicians Shishir Bajoria from West Bengal state and Anurag Kejriwal, the former chief of the Delhi unit of Loksatta Party, also figure on the list.
The Indian Express, which was a partner for The Panama Papers project said while the Reserve Bank India let individuals buy shares under liberalised remittance scheme, it never permitted them to set up companies abroad. The Mossack Fonseca documents allegedly show companies were set up long before the rules were changed, and the purpose may have been to park foreign exchange in a tax haven.
The papers also cast fresh light on the corruption scandal engulfing footballs world governing body, revealing that FIFA ethics committee member Juan Pedro Damiani had business ties with three men who have been indicted in the probe.
Disgraced UEFA chief Michel Platini allegedly used Mossack Fonseca to administer an offshore company, while Messi and his father apparently own a shell company not discovered in a Spanish investigation into the football stars tax affairs.
Platini denies wrongdoing.
I think the leak will prove to be probably the biggest blow the offshore world has ever taken because of the extent of the documents, said ICIJ director Gerard Ryle.
One of the law firms founders, Ramon Fonseca, told AFP the leaks were a crime, a felony and an attack on Panama.
Certain countries dont like it that we are so competitive in attracting companies, he said.
Panamas government said it had zero tolerance for any shady deals, and vowed to vigorously cooperate with any legal investigations.
Though most of the alleged dealings are said by the ICIJ to be legal, they are likely to have a serious impact on many of those named.
Icelands Prime Minister Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsson is expected to face a no-confidence vote this week over allegations he used a secret offshore firm called Wintris Inc. to hide money in the British Virgin Islands.
The investigators claim he owned millions of dollars of Icelandic bank bonds during the financial crisis, when the countrys entire financial system collapsed and its lenders had to be bailed out.
I have never hidden assets, Gunnlaugsson told a journalist from the Swedish SVT channel. Its a bit like youre accusing me of something, he added, visibly irritated, before calling off the interview.
At least 33 people and companies listed in the documents were blacklisted by the US government for wrongdoing, including dealings with North Korea and Iran, as well as Lebanons Islamist group Hezbollah, the ICIJ said.
Japans Asahi Shimbun reported 400 individuals and companies had been named, while Australia said it has launched an probe into 800 wealthy Mossack Fonseca clients.

My son's life in danger now: Gunaratnams mother
	
The Frontline Socialist Party (FSP) Activist Kumar Gunaratnams mother Rajamani Gunaratnam today requested the Government to give Sri Lankan citizenship to her son and ensure his safety during the imprisonment.
Speaking at a media conference organised by the FSP, Ms. Gunaratnam said she was afraid of her younger sons life, after he was transferred from Kegalle Prison, where he was detained for five years to the Anuradhapura Prison, without giving a fair or proper reason.
She said when there were many other prisons apart from the Anuradhapura Prison, the Prisons Departments sudden move to send him to a far place like that raised her suspicion.
Gunaratnams mother asked the Government as to why Sri Lankan citizenship could not be granted to her son, who was born in Kegalle, studied at St. Mary's College, Kegalle and later completed higher studies at the University of Peradeniya, where Kumar first engaged in political activism.
My elder son Ranjithan Gunaratnam, who was the Convener of Inter-University Students' Federation in 1989 was also abducted. I lost him. I cant lose my second son too. I fear for his life now because he was taken to a very far place from me. When he was held in Kegalle Prison, I used to visit him often. Now, I cant go to Anuradhapura, whenever I want to see my son,
He is a patient, he has diabetes. We had given him medicine for diabetes, when he was in Kegalle. But, now we are deprived from giving him medical care too.
I am afraid that his life would be in very dangerous situation. I request relevant authorities to give him the Sri Lankan citizenship and let him live free like others, Gunaratnams mother said before she broke down in front of the media.
Meanwhile, Gunaratnams sister Niranjala Gunaratnam said according to the Solicitor General at AGs Department, the issue with regard to the request for SL citizenship was over, after the verdict was given for the Kumars case on alleged violation of Immigration and Emigration Laws.
FSP Propaganda Secretary Pubudu Jayagoda said they would discuss the issue with the Commissioner General of Prisons Department regarding abnormal sending of a prisoner to a far place, violating normal procedure.
He accused the Government of taking political revenge by making a non-committal approach with regard to his request for citizenship.
He stated that the FSP would seek assistance from the national and international human rights organisations against the violation of the rights of their comrade. (Piyumi Fonseka)

Navy will protect transnational trade: Ranil
	
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said yesterday that the government would procure the equipment -- ships and aircraft -- to enable the Sri Lanka Navy to protect transnational trade in international waters.
Speaking at a commissioning parade at the Marine Naval Academy in Trincomalee, he said the Navy would protect international shipping lanes in the Indian and Pacific Ocean regions in the future.
The Sri Lanka Navy will have to play a role in protecting the sea routes across the Indian Ocean, the Pacific Ocean, the sea off Banda Aceh and the Strait of Malacca. We will have to prepare for that," he said.
"It will be necessary to safeguard the Indian Ocean in particular, as international trade will be affected if a ship runs into trouble there," he said.
He said Sri Lanka would purchase all the necessary equipment, including ships and aircraft, needed for the navy to play the international role.
The premier said country's GDP should be increased fourfold in order to generate funds for this purpose.
"We will go in for economic agreements with China, Europe, the Middle East and the East African region to get international markets for Sri Lankan goods," he said, while stressing that the GDP would be increased by developing international trade.
"You officers who pass out today are lucky, as you are not going to safeguard the Sri Lankan seas alone but the seas in the whole region," he said. (Yohan Perera)

## Title: Rising microfinance a potential risk for Lankan NBFIs: Fitch

Rising microfinance a potential risk for Lankan NBFIs: Fitch
	
Sri Lankan non-bank financial institutions (NBFIs) rising exposure to microfinance could pose a risk to their credit profiles, Fitch Ratings Lanka said in a
recent study.
The exposure among Fitch-rated NBFIs, which stood at just 4 percent of total loans of these entities by March 2014, has now increased to 27 percent by December 2015. This exposure to microfinance reached a peak of 30 percent of loans by end-March 2015. Sri Lankas banks and NBFIs engage in easy businesses which usually operate in boom and bust cycles.
The banking and financial services sector went on lending on poor peoples gold until the global gold prices crashed in late 2012 and paid hefty price in terms if write-offs. Some banks had exposure levels in excess of 35 percent to such lending from the total lending book.
A similar cycle ended in December 2015 when everyone expanded their loan books by growing their leasing books until the government slapped hefty taxes and lending restrictions on vehicles after causing much damage to the economy and society. With the vehicle leasing coming to a standstill, banks say they see hardly any growth in their loan books.
Microfinance is also one such sector which could at anytime explode as such lending is uncollateralized and repayment ability is predominantly based on the general economic condition, which is getting tougher by the day with rising taxes and inflation amid higher interest rates. Hence, any such shocks to the financial sector stability could be a blow to the economy as delinquencies of such loans occur at a time when the financial services sector is riding tougher times, the analysts pointed out.
Microfinance lending among Fitch-rated NBFIs takes the form principally of lending to an individual who is part of a small group, with the rest of the group members cross-guaranteeing the loans in the event of default. Lending is generally in small amounts, and is used to support income-generating activity. It involves uncollateralized lending to a customer segment that is usually characterized as low income and with limited access to formal
financial services.
Fitch believes that lending to this segment is likely to be more susceptible to asset-quality deterioration during periods of economic stress. In fact, several microfinance institutions  banks or NBFIs  lending to the same individual or family which could then aggravates the problem. If the individual or family finds it difficult to repay, they could easily take another loan from a different institution to repay the earlier loan until thesystem collapses.
The analysts pointed out this could have a contagion risk where the failure of one such institution could have a direct impact on another. They question whether these lenders do a proper follow up on what these micro funds are being used and in most cases they are used for consumption and this is a key risk,they warned. 
Furthermore, Sri Lanka continues to lack a comprehensive regulatory and supervisory system for the microfinance sector. As a result, many of the large number of institutions engaged in the provision of microfinance are unregulated. Efforts to introduce such regulations have been ongoing for many years, including the passing of a microfinance bill. Fitch maintains that the passage of prudential regulatory requirements on microfinance entities should be positive for the financial sector.
Fitch-rated NBFIs have made efforts to manage the risk of their significant exposures to microfinance through product structuring, regular collections and close contact with borrowers. Lending rates on microfinance are also generally high, due to the greater credit risk of this type of lending.
Nonetheless, the rising exposure to microfinance points to increased risk for NBFIs, especially during a period when operating conditions could become more challenging for the financial sector as a whole. Fitch expects Sri Lankas real gross domestic product (GDP) growth to remain relatively high at above 5 percent through 2017. But the outlook for the financial sector is largely dependent on the operating environment, and volatility remains a key risk inthe economy. Notably, Fitch downgraded the sovereign to B+ in March with a negative outlook.
