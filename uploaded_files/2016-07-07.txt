BBS demands action against Salley; challenges for an open debate
	
BBS General Secretary Ven. Galagodaththe Gnanasara Thera today challenged former Central Provincial Council member Azath Salley for an open debate, instead of him issuing inflammatory statements.
Ven. Thera said he was ready for an open debate anywhere in the country, or in Medina in Saudi Arabia.
?Salley had threatened that he would blow himself up like a suicide bomber and kill me over a statement I made in Mahiyanganaya. Salley?s statement is shocking to Sinhala Buddhist society and now it will become a major controversy in the social media,? Ven. Thera said.
The Thera had also condemned the burning of Buddhist flags in Mahiyangana on the Wesak Poya day by Muslim extremists, over a preaching of Dhamma against cattle slaughter.
?A protest was held in the area. The extremists not even feel sorry for burning the flags. They had also had lodged a complaint with the Police IGP,? Gnanasara Thera said.
Meanwhile, BBS Chief Executive Officer Dilantha Withanage said making such statements was a violation of Fundamental Rights of Gnanasara Thera and the country people.
?I would like to ask Azath Salley in view of Sinhala Buddhist people, who he is? If there was an insult to the God that he believes in, he should let that God handle it. Is he the representative of the God to mete out punishments?? Withanage said.
?We request the Government to conduct an immediate investigation over Salley?s statement and to take a clear decision to arrest him and to remove him from the Government post.
?We would launch an open debate under the leadership of Gnanasara Thera in society like the ?Panadura Wadaya?, if President Maithripala Sirisena, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and IGP Pujith Jayasundara do not act on this,? he said. (Chaturanga Pradeep)

Education officials more at fault than Thewarapperuma: JHU
	
Jathika Hela Urumaya (JHU) said today Deputy Minister PalithaThewarapperuma only mediated to mete out justice to the parents and children who were deprived of their right to education though his behaviour was unacceptable.
JHU central committee member Ven. Hadigalle Wimalasara Thera said what was even more serious was the fact that education authorities had ignored the plight ofthe nine students who were without a school for six months.
?As a responsible political party, we do not approve of Deputy Minister Thewarapperuma?s violent behaviour but he did so to mete out justice to the parents and the children who were deprived of their right to education. It is the education authorities who must be faulted not so much the deputy minister,? he said.
The Thera said it was regrettable that the parents were remanded for no other reason but because of desperate attempt to get a school for their children.
?They entered the school premises not to loot but to win a basic right for their children. It is a matter that has to be looked into in a more humane manner than in legal terms. They may have resorted to violence because justice was not meted out to them,? he said.(Ajith Siriwardana)

Four killed In blast at Bangladesh Eid Prayers, gunbattle On
	
Four persons including a policeman were killed and seven were wounded on Thursday after a bomb blast and gun-battle near a mass Eid prayer gathering in Bangladesh's Kishoreganj district.
The attack - the first on Muslims during Eid in Bangladesh - took place 140 km from capital Dhaka, where seven terrorists attacked a popular cafe last Friday, killing 22 people.
A group of attackers reportedly threw homemade bombs at a police team at a school near a prayer ground where at least 200,000 people were gathered. Firing is still on between security forces and the attackers.
Some reports said the attack was targeted at a the imam or chief cleric of Kishoreganj, who is known for his liberal views. He had reportedly started a signature campaign to condemn terrorism in the name of Islam.
After the Dhaka cafe terror last weekend, the Islamic State terror group had issued a chilling video threatening more attacks. "What you witnessed in Bangladesh was a glimpse. This will repeat, repeat and repeat until you lose and we win and the sharia is established throughout the world," said a man identified as Bangladeshi fighter Abu Issa al-Bengali, in the video.

PM seeks Speaker to rule on SC pronouncement
	
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe today in Parliament sought Speaker Karu Jayasuriya to overrule the Supreme Court pronouncement given way back in 2006 saying Sri Lanka's accession to the Optional Protocol of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) needed a two- thirds majority of Parliament and approval by people at a referendum.
Calling it a perverted interpretation of the Constitution, the Prime Minister said the obiter dicta of the Supreme Court violated Articles 3, 4 and 5 in this respect.
He made this point in answer to a question directed by Government MP M.H.M. Salman. Mr. Salman said Sri Lankan citizens used to complain to the UN Human Rights Committee, but the successive governments stopped responding to it because of this Court pronouncement called the Singarasa Case.
The Premier replied that the Supreme Court did not have the power to violate the basic tenets of the Constitution.
"Instead of confining itself to the matter before the Court, it has meandered into a totally irrelevant area and made pronouncements on the Constitutional competence of the President to accede to the Optional Protocol," he said.
He said it should be left to the Speaker to rule on this after necessary consultations.
He cited good governance, rule of law and human rights, transparency and accountability as the cornerstones of the national unity government. Accordingly, he said the government informed the Office of High Commissioner for Human Rights in January, this year of its participation in the communication procedure of the UN Human Rights Committee.
The Prime Minister noted that the government intended to devise a time-line and appropriate approach to respond to pending communications from the Committee. He asserted the government's commitment to it.
Sri Lanka acceded to the first Optional Protocol in 1997.
Meanwhile, Joint Opposition's parliamentary group leader Dinesh Gunawardane asked for a debate on the matter as it was a serious issue before the Speaker rules.
The Prime Minister said the Speaker could consult the members in the form of a session which might even take two days before giving his ruling.(Kelum Bandara and Yohan Perera)

Sanath calls for more commitment to fitness
	
Chairman of Selectors Sanath Jayasuriya wants more commitment on fitness by players if they are to stay free from injuries.
Jayasuriya addressing media after arriving in Sri Lanka following a disastrous tour to England said he has had discussions with the board in this regard.
The visitors lost the Test series 2-0, the one-day international series 3-0 and also the only T20. The closest they have come to a win was in the opening ODI at Trent Bridge where a last ball six secured a dramatic tie.
Hampered by injuries, their bowling unit--which was once described as the best in the trade by none other than Jayasuriya--had cut a sorry figure at the hands of Englishmen and was a major reason for team?s disappointing performance.
Adding to this was a spate of injuries to the country?s frontline bowlers, particularly Dhammika Prasad (shoulder) and Dushmantha Chameera (lower back stress fracture). Skipper Angelo Mathews and Dinesh Chandimal also played through hamstring injuries while the misfiring top order bat Lahiri Thirimanne was sent back home with a lower back strain.
?My concern is this is happening for a long time. I have been talking about this with SLC officials. Of course, you need commitment from the players. I am telling this in front of the players,? said Jayasuriya. ?They have to come out of their comfort zone and play. There will be a lot of cricket, of course, and if one cannot keep up with the pressure they should say they can?t play. If not, they need to train hard,?
He said the board, the selectors, cricket committee and the high performance manager should sit down and work out a plan to keep the players fit. ?We can make plans. If the players are not committed we cannot sort this out. I am not saying they are not committed, but they need to do something different,? the former dashing opener said.
Mohan de Silva, Secretary Sri Lanka Cricket, said that they, too, were concerned over the fitness level of players and believed a quick fix is needed to sort this out.
?No sooner we got elected, we appointed an expert panel of doctors to review injuries of players and also we brought down a high performance manager in Simon Willis to help the process. According to Willis, the amount of pre-training put in by players wasn?t sufficient. This may be one of the reason. But we need a fix to this issue and we need commitment from the players in improving their own fitness,? he added.
Meanwhile, Angelo Mathews said despite a disastrous tour, he sees light at the end of the tunnel, particularly in batting.
The batting showed a glimpse of hope, particularly that of Kusal Mendis, Danushka Gunathilaka, Dinesh Chandimal and Kusal Janith Perera who returned to international cricket after being cleared of a doping offence. Mathews believes that if they can fix their woes in bowling and fielding they could pose a real challenge to the Australians in the forthcoming tour.
?It was a tough challenge for us. After the disastrous first two tests we should show some improvement individually in patches. I am really pleased the way Mendis took the challenge, the way he faced James Anderson and Stuard Broad was impressive. Chandimal and Danushka also played well which I think are the positives we can take going forward,? the skipper said.
He also thanked the board, media and fans for supporting them through the tough time.
?I was expecting a lot of criticisms on our return but everyone has been very supportive. Thank you,? the captain said. (Champika Fernando)

The Value Added Tax (VAT), which had been increased up to 15 percent from 11 would not be repealed but alterations would be done to justify the increment, Deputy Minister Ajith P. Perera said today.
Addressing a media briefing Mr. Perera said it was impractical to abolish VAT and the Government was on its way to proceed with the alterations in the tax in order to offer relief to the people.
?At present, the increment of VAT has been interpreted as an unusual concept of ?Good Governance? by anti-government forces. But I would like to clarify that, VAT is a world known concept, and has prevailed for many years. VAT is a first-rated and practical tax. If somebody interpreted VAT as an ominous tax that person is not aware of the real concept behind VAT,? he added. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)
