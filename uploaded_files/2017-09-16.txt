## Title: Anagarika Dharmapala  was a revivalist when  Buddhism was threatened

Anagarika Dharmapala  was a revivalist when  Buddhism was threatened
	
?
?
Srimath Anagarika Dharmapala, whose clarion commands influenced and inspired to awaken the dormant nation, is hugely respected and gracefully remembered on Sunday. September 17th marks the 153rd birth anniversary of this wonderful patriot. ??
Anagarika hails from a distinguished Sri Lankan family. He is the eldest son of reputed business magnate Muhandiram Don Carolis Hewavitharana and Srimathi Mallika Hewavitharna, a devout Buddhist Upasika (Devotee). Initially Anagarika was named as David Hewavitharna. ??
At the time of his birth under the evil influence of western domination, Buddhism and Aryan culture had dropped to its lowest ebb in Sri Lanka. Ravaged, rampaged and battered by three foreign invaders, the island nation had almost lost its national identity. Western rulers vandalized our Pirivena (Temple) education and national occupations. Our ancient tanks were neglected and agriculture was ruined. By the introduction of a cluster of liquor taverns islandwide, our esthetic morals were denounced and the thrifty society was degraded in to criminal wasters and lazy drones. Educational institutes for Buddhist children were almost non existent. As such David too, had no option but to study at two missionary schools, where he was able to byheart the Holy Bible. ??
?
As the trio visited the remote corners of the island, Dharmapala?s oratorical talents had the countrymen spellbound.?
?
However, the reluctance to forsake Buddhist practices brought him in to conflict with the missionary authorities. ?I was reading a pamphlet on ?Four Nobel Points?, when the school?s boarding master threw out the pamphlet. I left that school in 1878,? David, who later changed his name to Dharmapala, had once said.?
Thereafter, David studied for three years at S. Thomas? College, Mount Lavinia. ??
Since he passed, everyday, the temple where Ven. Migettuwatte Gunananda Thera resided, he started frequenting the place. He received the opportunity to advance in his oriental studies under the guidance and patronage of Ven. Hikkaduwe Sri Sumangala Thera. ??
Following the untimely demise of his beloved younger sister and observing the condition of his grief stricken mother, he realized the emptiness and sufferings of worldly life. Thus, in his teens he aspired to apply the doctrine of the Buddha, to alleviate suffering of all human beings. He then resolved to become a homeless celibate (seeker of Truth) and changed his name to Anagarika Dharmapala. ??
?In contrast to my wine drinking, meat eating and pleasure loving missionary teachers, the Bhikkus were meek and abstemious. I loved their company and would sit quietly in a corner and listen to their wise discourse,? Dharmapala reminisced.?
?
He was impressed by the publication of a report by a visiting American spiritualist, Dr. J.M. Peebles, on the ?Great Panadura debate?. The philosophical arguments of Col. Olcott and Lady H.P. Blavatsky, which were in the publication caught his attention.?
?
He was impressed by the publication of a report by a visiting American spiritualist, Dr. J.M. Peebles, on the ?Great Panadura debate?. The philosophical arguments of Col. Olcott and Lady H.P. Blavatsky, which were in the publication caught his attention. The due, who were engaged in theosophical work in USA, visited Sri Lanka in 1880. The two heavenly visitors on their arrival at the Galle Port, were met by Ven. Sumangala Nayake Thera. They observed ?Panchaseela? (The five precepts prescribed for a layman) and vowed to dedicate themselves to salvage Sri Lanka. Being the founder of BTS (Buddhist Theosophical Society) Col. Olcott initiated the Buddhist National Educational Scheme. Dharmapala wholeheartedly appreciated the sudden national renaissance coming into effect with their arrival. It was at this temple that Dharmapala first made acquaintance with these foreign guests. ??
When the Theosophists revisited Sri Lanka in 1884, Dharmapala expressed his desire to study Theosophy and Occultism from Himalayan spiritualists. Lady Blavatsky persuaded Dharmapala?s parents to let him visit India. She also advised him to forget Occultism and study Pali, the language of the Buddha. ??
Accordingly he first visited India, in 1884. On his return from Adyar, Dharmapala joined the Department of Education in 1886. Subsequently he obtained a pass with distinctions at the Clerical Service Examination conducted by the British Government. ??
?
Forming Buddhist schools?
In 1886, when Col Olcott and C.W. Leadbeater (Founder Principal of Ananda College), revisited Ceylon, to collect funds to establish a Buddhist National Educational scheme, Dharmapala, who was employed in the Government service, readily applied for three months leave and joined hands with Col Olcott and Leadbeater in their island wide campaign. Ananda College Colombo, Dharmaraja College Kandy and Mahinda College Galle were the first three educational institutes they established under the cluster of Buddhist Theosophical Society? schools (BTS). ??
As the trio visited the remote corners of the island, Dharmapala?s oratorical talents had the countrymen spellbound. During this entourage, Dharmapala received the official results of the Government Clerical Service Examination conducted by the British Government. The results ?indicated that he had obtained an extraordinary Distinction Pass. Dharmapala, who was deeply conscious and concerned about the Buddhist revival movement and the upliftment of down trodden fellow beings, lost no time in sending his letter of resignation from Government service to devote full time for the on going rehabilitation programs. ??
As they traveled more in to interior villages, Dharmapala began to realize the grim realities of rural life where people were without roads, houses, schools or hospitals. These poor folk who were the backbone of the nation were subdued and discriminated by the colonial rulers.?
?
Although he became a staunch Buddhist in the orthodox sense of the term, yet he was neither a bigot nor a fanatic. The philosophy of Buddhism in its practical bearing on life and its sundry problems became incentives to his complete identification with ideas of individual and social welfare.?
?
?
Travels to India?
Dharmapala went on a pilgrimage to the sacred Jaya Siri Maha Bodhi in 1891. It became the turning point of his life. During Dharmapala?s visit to Buddhagaya, and the sacred Jaya Sri Maha Bodhi premises, the place where Prince Sidhartha became enlightened, a sudden impulse passed through him. ??
He was shocked and stunned to observe the unduly neglected state of affairs and the gross religious discrimination brought upon the global Buddhist population by mahants. Anagarika sternly determined not to retreat from there, until and unless justice was meted to all Buddhists. He took immediate action to launch an agitation campaign. He founded the Maha Bodhi Society (MBS) in 1891 and the MB Journal in order to address the world. He received a generous financial support for this endeavour from his father. Dharmapala spearheaded his Buddhagaya rescue campaigns thereafter. ??
In the meantime, having seen a copy of the MB journal and being impressed by its contents, the organizers of World Parliament of Religions (about to be held in San Francisco) extended an invitation for an MBS representative to attend the parley. ??
In the absence of a competent candidate to represent the MB Society, Dharmapala, who was only 26 years old then, himself undertook the challenge and attended the conference in San Francisco in September 1893.?
?
Close friends?
Buddhists the world over responded to his clarion command. ?Intellectuals, philanthropists and members of royal dynasties extended him the fullest cooperation to espouse his great cause. ??
In India Swami Vivekananda, Rabindranath Tagore, Mahatma Gandhi, M.C. Mookarjee and ?Indian Mirror? Editor Narendranath, were his close friends. ??
In England Sir Edwin Arnold, the author of ?Light of Asia?, remained his lifelong friend. Russian Lady Madam Blavatsky, American National Col Henry Steel Olcott and Lady Annie Beasant were his close associates. ??
Mary Foster Robinson supported him (since 1893) with a mass of wealth. It was with her generous contributions that Dharmapala established a permanent Buddhist Viharaya in Ealing London in 1926. He purchased two properties for the Mahabodhi Centre and Viharaya in Calcutta, in 1906 and 1915. He also established schools in Hiniduma and Rajagiriya to educate poor children in 1916 and a free hospital in Ceylon in memory Lady Mary Foster Robinson (1914).?
Following on the golden footsteps of great Emperor Dharmasoka, Dharmapala reinitiated and intensified the World Buddhist missionary programs. According to his letter addressed to the Colonial Secretary in June 1905, at his own expense he had traversed three times round the World, preaching Buddhism and establishing Buddhist monasteries in London and elsewhere.?
?
Maiden speech?
Dharmapala made his maiden speech in Calcutta, in 1891. The speech was organized under the patronage of renowned N.C. Mookarjee. Following his remarkable Chicago address at the religious parley in 1893, he visited USA thrice. Pandit Dipak Kumar Barua (M.A., Dip. Lib), a special Bharat researcher states. ??
?During the eighteenth century in the realm of religion, India had entered the zone of uncreative habit, and of decadent tradition.? With the beginning of the nineteenth century she began to experience some striking changes in religion and on the eve of such a religious reformation in modern India, a Ceylonese Buddhist named David Hewavitarne, later popularly known as Anagarika Dharmapala (b. 1864, Sept. 17th-d. 1933, April 29th) who appeared as ?the herald of a new age,? had an opportunity to save Buddhism and Buddhist culture from the deadening influence of spiritual blindness and superstitions. With profound learning and high philosophical acumen, Dharmapala was really ?the harbinger of the idea of Universal Humanism, the humanist? as he preached the noble doctrines of Buddhism about love, compassion and fraternity. ?His whole being was saturated with humanism. Although he became a staunch Buddhist in the orthodox sense of the term, yet he was neither a bigot nor a fanatic. The philosophy of Buddhism in its practical bearing on life and its sundry problems became incentives to his complete identification with ideas of individual and social welfare. Like Asoka, the Mauryan emperor, he promulgated the Buddhist culture in the form of humanized culture in the Parliament of Religions in 1893 in Chicago. He was, during that era, probably the first Buddhist whose personality won demonstrative recognition in the western countries. ??
It was indeed a worthy scene to observe the first session of the Parliament in the Hall of Columbus. In his vibrant voice Dharmapala requested all to respond to the good wishes of four hundred and seventy-five millions Buddhists, the blessings and peace of the founder of the religion-which has prevailed for so many centuries in Asia-that have made Asia mild.?
His own paper titled ?The World?s Debt to Buddha?- which was read there on the 18th Sept. 1893- was bereft of either theology or anthropomorphism. In the simplest possible manner he explained the Buddhist principles, supported by numerous quotations from the Canon. Yet his speech was so effective that many Americans instantaneously expressed their wish to adopt the noble religion of Lord Buddha. He, moreover, urged them to ?learn, to think without prejudice, love all beings for love?s sake, express convictions fearlessly and lead a life of purity.?Prof. Benoy Sarkar addressed him as ?a maker of modern Bengal? since Dharmapala was able to bring a change in the outlook of the Bengalese with regard to religion and society.?
?Give up your dreamy philosophies and sensualising ceremonies. Millions are daily suffering the pangs of hunger; drinking the water that animals in the forest would not drink and sleeping and living in houses inhaling poison day after day. There is wealth in India enough to feed all. But the abominations of caste, creed and sect are making millions suffer,? were Dharmapala?s words. ??
?
Swami Vivekananda?
Having learned of Dharmapala?s famous speeches at Calcutta, Swami Vivekananda wrote a letter (1894) from America to him in a very frank manner. Hope, your noble work will succeed. You are a worthy servant of Buddha who came for ?Bahujana Hitaya Bahujana Sukhaya?, (for the good of the many, for the happiness of the many) and finished the letter with an affectionate compliment. ?Yours ever in brotherly love, Vivekananda.? ? ?The fragrance of his fame has traveled afar: He lived in wonderful perception of the Truth.? Chaing Hsia-Pias added.?
Mahatma Gandhi, in his address at Maha Bodhi Society of India, Calcutta in May 1925 said ?Friends, it is now my pleasant duty to perform this service. I shall not say anything of these proceedings. Dr. Dharmapala has added a pathetic touch to this service and he has laid on my shoulders a burden which I consider I am ill fitted to carry?.
A thorough student of Christianity, with an unusually high degree of familiarity with Christian scriptures, Dharmapala was a sincere admirer of the ethical doctrines of Christ. He, of course, rejected the idea of creation and he had repeatedly given his arguments in support of his standpoint. ??
Dharmapala?s letter addressed to Fransis J. Payne, underscores his deep commitments to his religious mission. ??
?It seems that your vigorous activities in the arena of the Dhamma propaganda have come to a standstill. How did the collapse come? What have you done with regard to the publication of your Buddhist Bible? When activities cease people understand that life has left the body.While we are alive we have to do good
Kamma? What are we here for? The answer is given in the Maha Mangala Sutta. There is nothing so evil as association with the muddle headed, and that is what 99 per cent. of?
people do.?
?
?The Untouchables?
?Forty years of ceaseless activity has made me physically weak. For 34 years I have spent my life in India in voluntary exile. The name of the Lord Buddha was hardly known 37 years ago by the people of India. Today all of India acknowledges him as their God. There was no Vihara in India, no Buddhist publication, no preaching until started by the Maha Bodhi Society. There is a great harvest to be reaped if there are Buddhist workers. The number of Untouchables waiting to be rescued from the Brahmanical despotism is 65 million. The Brahmans don?t want them. If the Untouchable are converted the number of Moslems will increase to 135 millions. Padres will be glad to have the number of Native Christians increased from 3 million to 68 million. ??
?
Stubbornness?
Besides his magnificent personality he always exhibited a militant stubbornness whenever and where ever he confronted injustice. ??
He once said, ?under Colonial Imperialists, continuous political oppression on me has aged me much and I am now almost an invalid and my death will be hastened by the official tortures to which I am subjected to?.?
As they did to Mahathma Gandhi, ?the Father of Non Violence?, fearing the emergence of his great leadership the ruthless colonial rulers, adhering to their obnoxious laws discriminated and imprisoned Dharmapala. Yet they couldn?t arrest his will power. During 1915 communal riots broke out when the Britishers arrested the rest of the national leaders. Dharmapala in a strong worded letter hit back at the Colonial Secretary, citing the British attitude towards Germans at the war. He challenged them to consider the local reactions in the same context. Dharmapala?s historic correspondences were fully published in Dr. Guruge?s ?Anagarika Centenary Volume?, and is too heavy to repeat here (page 537). ??
Gradually the British Governors too, began to respect and extended their cooperation to Dharmapala. In 1922, Sir Harcourt Bultle the Governor of the United Provinces India, laid the foundation stone to build a Vihara at Saranath while the Government of India expressed its readiness to present a Relic of the Lord Buddha to be enshrined at the proposed Saranath Viharaya. Thus, the Mulgandhakuti Viharaya, one of Dharmapala?s cherished dreams, was realized in 1930. ??
?
Entering priesthood ?
Dharmapala, who lived a restless life for the cause of humanity, made his last visit to Sri Lanka in 1931. During that visit he established the ?Dharmapala Trust? and gifted Mallika Santagar?s home in memory of his loved mother. ??
In 1931 Dharmapala entered the order of Maha Sangha becoming the Bhikkhu Sri Devamitta Dharmapala and received his higher ordination, Upasampada, two years later. ??
In conformity with the teachings of the Buddha, that all conditioned things are subject to transient (anicca), sorrow (dukkha) and soulless (anatta), Dharmapala- the energetic and enterprising Bodhisatva- mindfully breathed his last breath facing the Mulagandhakuti Viharaya on April 29, 1933.?
The last words he uttered were ?Let me be reborn?? I wish to be born 25 times to spread Lord Buddha?s Dhamma??
Even today, in Sri Lanka, you will suddenly notice an image of Dharmapala facing you. A nation in its inability to express and exhibit its vast gratitude towards this benevolent leader has thus carved his name with pride and solidified his presence by erecting scores of gilded statues throughout our motherland.?
May he attain the Supreme Bliss?of Nirvana!

CB bond sales: Sujeewa ready to explain real situation
	
Deputy Minister Sujeewa Senasinghe said yesterday he was prepared to explain to any commission of inquiry how treasury bonds work and about the real situation with regard to the bond auction on February 2015.
He told Daily Mirror that he had studied about bonds during his tenure as a member of Committee on Public Enterprises (COPE) chaired by former Minister D.E.W. Gunasekera and while being a member of COPE chaired by JVP MP Sunil Handunetti.
?The bond issue was first probed by COPE during the term of the previous parliament and I did a study about bond auctions and how they were bought and sold. Therefore I am able to explain the real situation at any commission of inquiry,? the deputy minister said.
He said the footnotes he and others wanted inserted in the COPE report were based on the facts unearthed during the study conducted by him and other members such as Dr. Harsha De Silva.
The deputy minister said he wondered why the Presidential Commission of Inquiry on the bond sales had not summoned him so far and why his name had not been mentioned at any time during the inquiry.
He said the allegation that former MP Rosy Senanayake?s son had passed information gathered during the COPE inquiry to Perpetual Treasures Ltd owner Arjun Aloysius was utterly baseless. (Yohan Perera)

CEB strike a failure, says Ministry; TU rejects claims
	
Despite CEB employees launching a work stoppage from Wednesday (13) the Power and Renewable Energy Ministry said it was able to maintain regular supply of electricity without any major disruption.
Ministry spokesman Pathum Pasqual said according to reports, 100 per cent efficiency had been reported in power generation and transmission while the distribution remained at 65 per cent even though few electricity breakdowns were reported in several areas.
He also said the trade union had even withdrawn CEB staff from the National Hospital risking the lives of patients.
?One cannot justify putting the lives of the patients in hospitals in danger. The ministry appreciates all staff member of the CEB who did not take part in this inhumane trade union action,? he said.
He also said the ministry would supply electricity continuously under any circumstances.
However Ceylon Electricity Employees Union (CEEU) Secretary Ranjan Jayalal told the Daily Mirror yesterday that the strike was successful and the ministry was making false statement to disrupt the trade union action.
?If the strike was unsuccessful why had the ministry asked retired employees to report for work,? he asked.
He also charged that the ministry had made several futile attempts to continue the supply using contractors as a result of which a few workers had been electrocuted.
Power failures had been reported in several areas of the country and it was revealed that they were the results of breakdowns which were not attended. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

## Title: Clash of the Commanders

Clash of the Commanders
	
?
By D.B.S.Jeyaraj
The recent spat - if one may call it that - between two former commanders of the Sri Lankan Army has caused quite a furore. Field Marshall Sarath Fonseka and Lieutenant-General Jagath Jayasuriya have engaged in a heated exchange over issues of command and control responsibility, as well as alleged war crimes. Sarath Fonseka served as Army Commander from December 6, 2005 to July 15, 2009. His immediate successor Jagath Jayasuriya served as Army Commander from July 15, 2009 to July 31, 2013. The clash between Fonseka and Jayasuriya may very well be described as a battle between two ex-Army Commanders.
The flare- up occurred when Lt. Gen Jagath Jayasuriya, who was accredited to Brazil and five other South American countries as Ambassador, got targeted by a Human Rights organisation, which sought to invoke universal jurisdiction against the ex -Army Chief turned Envoy for war crimes, allegedly committed during the war between the Sri Lankan armed forces and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE). Jayasuriya who had returned to Sri Lanka by that time denied all such allegations.
It is indeed noteworthy that the official position of the Sri Lankan Govt. during the war was that the armed forces were implementing a ?zero civilian casualty policy?.?
The inevitable conclusion arising from such a stance would be that no civilians were harmed. The then President Mahinda Rajapaksa went on record that the Sri Lankan soldiers fought the war with ?A weapon in one hand and the UN Human Rights Charter in the other hand, carrying provisions on their backs for the entrapped civilians with their hearts brimming over with compassion?. This statement by the then Supreme Commander of the armed forces suggested by extension that no war crimes were committed as alleged.
It was against such a backdrop that the Non -Governmental Organisation International Truth and Justice Project (ITJP) resorted to legal action against Jagath Jayasuriya in Latin America. It is somewhat a puzzle as to why the ITJP waited until the tail -end of the Sri Lankan envoy?s tenure to file suits in courts instead of doing so well before his term ended.?
The ITJP had raised such allegations before when it publicised reports of alleged Human Rights violations and war crimes being committed at the Sri Lankan Army?s ?Joseph Camp? in Vavuniya. Jagath Jayasuriya who served as the Wanni region Commander in the final stages of the war was based in the camp referred to as ?Joseph camp?.
?
A point he emphasised in his favour was the fact that he had not been involved in actual combat during the final phases of the war.?As such he could not be accused of alleged war crimes as he had no role to play in the fighting was the ex-Army Chief?s stance.?
?
?
Joint Services Special Operations Command (JOSSOP)
Although people in northern Sri Lanka as well as international organisations referred to the main security forces camp in Vavuniya as ?Joseph? Camp, in reality the camp?s name was not Joseph.?
It was actually ?JOSSOP?. When J.R. Jayewardene was the Sri Lankan President and Minister of Defence , the Joint Services Special Operations Command (JOSSOP) was set up in Vavuniya to co-ordinate ?anti-terrorist activity? in the districts of Mannar, Vavuniya, Mullaitheevu and Trincomalee. The Vavuniya camp housing the JOSSOP headquarters was referred to as the ?JOSSOP Camp?.?
Gradually the people started calling the camp by the name ?Joseph? instead of JOSSOP as it sounded alike. Some years later the JOSSOP was dismantled but ?Joseph Camp? remained as the head camp of the Wanni based security forces.
When the ITJP resorted to legal action and raised allegations against him, Jagath Jayasuriya denied all complicity. There was a spate of media interviews in which the retired Lt. General refuted all charges made against him.?
A point he emphasised in his favour was the fact that he had not been involved in actual combat during the final phases of the war. As such he could not be accused of alleged war crimes as he had no role to play in the fighting was the ex-Army Chief?s stance.?
Jagath Jayasuriya had been appointed Wanni Security Forces Commander on August 7, 2007 and had continued in that position till the war ended in May 2009. Thereafter he continued in that position until succeeding Sarath Fonseka as Army Commander on July 15, 2009.
It was at this juncture that former Army Commander and current Regional Development Minister Sarath Fonseka queered the pitch for his erstwhile successor. Fonseka conducted a press conference in which he accused Jagath Jayasuriya of having committed war crimes. The Field Marshall claimed that he had proof and would be ready to testify against Jayasuriya if an investigation was held. It is widely acknowledged that there was little love lost between Fonseka and Jayasuriya. However Fonseka?s unexpected intervention was not entirely due to personal animosity. There was an element of self -preservation also.
Jagath Jayasuriya claiming that he had no part in the actual fighting and could not be held responsible for whatever had allegedly occurred in the battle front was an indirect attack on Fonseka himself.?
The implication was that it was Fonseka as the Army Commander in overall charge, who had to bear responsibility. If Jayasuriya was allowed to continue in this manner without being challenged, it would only have been a matter of time before blame would have been attached to Fonseka. Anticipating such an eventuality perhaps the Field Marshall staged the press conference in what could be likened to a pre-emptive strike to deflect the issue.
The statements made by Fonseka amounted to a bombshell. It was seized upon by and utilised by different sections for different reasons. Jagath Jayasuriya was compelled to respond to Fonseka. He reiterated the fact that he was only in charge of logistics and had never been the fighting commander. He further said that if indeed war crimes had occurred they were likely to have happened in the frontlines. As such the then Army Commander Fonseka bore responsibility and not he, asserted Jayasuriya. A point in the Lt. General?s favour was the statements made by the Field Marshall himself. According to newspaper reports Field Marshall Fonseka at his media briefing had clearly stated that Jayasuriya, in his capacity as SF Commander, Vavuniya, hadn?t enjoyed command and control responsibilities over fighting formations, deployed in the Wanni west and Wanni east fronts. Fonseka said Jayasuriya had been tasked with ensuring supplies and basically looking after the area under Government control. His functions had been similar to those assigned to the then SF Commander of Jaffna Maj. Gen. G.A. Chandrasiri .
?
Wanni Security Forces Commander
Though Fonseka himself had in a sense ?absolved? Jayasuriya of responsibility for whatever acts of omission or commission on the battle field, the Field Marshall was not ready to let Jayasuriya ?slip? way easily.?
Speaking to the media subsequently the regional development Minister said that he had information about some atrocious incidents happening to those detained at the Vavuniya headquarters camp. Therefore Jayasuriya had to take responsibility opined Fonseka.?
This statement had serious ramifications for Jayasuriya as the ITJP had on several occasions alleged that several Human Rights violations including torture had been committed at the Vavuniya ?Joseph? Camp when Jagath Jayasuriya was in charge there as Wanni Security Forces Commander.
?
If Jayasuriya was allowed to continue in this manner without being challenged, it would only have been a matter of time before blame would have been attached to Fonseka. Anticipating such an eventuality perhaps the Field Marshal staged the press conference in what could be likened to a pre-emptive strike to deflect the issue.
?
?
In an extensive interview given to a Colombo newspaper Jagath Jayasuriya denied charges that he had sanctioned or supervised the torture of detenues at the camp. However, in an exhibition of ?buck passing? the ex - Army Chief stated: ?I had my headquarters inside the same complex I was responsible for. But there were Commanders at various levels in other camps in the same premises. So, if something had happened in those camps I am not responsible.??
He went on to disclaim responsibility for the camp saying his subordinate the then Vavuniya Brigade Commander was in overall charge of the camp administration and was responsible for maintenance of security.?
?I was not the one in charge of security, The entire complex was not under my command,? said Jayasuriya.
Lt. Gen Jayasuriya also sought to put his erstwhile predecessor in hot water by stressing upon the fact that Sarath Fonseka had been in overall charge of the last battle against the LTTE and implying therefore that he was responsible for any alleged war crimes. At the same time Jayasuriya emphasised the point that Fonseka himself had categorically said that he (Jayasuriya) did not have operational command of troops. Jayasuriya said in the interview ?Army Commander Sarath Fonseka went to China with his mobile phone and the map of the Wanni? during the final stages of the armed conflict. Fonseka was contactable on telephone. Fonseka?s wife used to tell us ?his entire bed was taken up for the map?. I worked with him, so I also know he does that. He used to call and verify reports. I can say categorically he had given me in writing that I have no operational command of troops in the Wanni and that I will only do logistics. So, I was not giving orders,?.?
?
The conduct of former Defence Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa was extremely controversial during the election campaign. Despite the fact that he was a top Government Servant the then Defence Secretary engaged in open political discourse while addressing public meetings.?
?
?
Jayasuriya further said ?On the ground, whether something like that had happened or not, I don?t know because I was not on the frontline warring. I was in the Wanni Camp. At the highest level we don?t know. At the lower level, they may be knowing whether it happened or not.?
?
Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission
Ironically the same Jayasuriya who was disclaiming any responsibility in conducting the war in its final phase spoke differently in the aftermath of the war in 2009. Media organs run by sections of the Tamil Diaspora were quick to point out these ironic contradictions.?
?The entire northern operation was conducted in the tactical area of responsibility that came under my command,? Jayasuriya had said in 2010 in his capacity as Army commander. .?
?I was actively involved in the ground operations executing directives from Army headquarters and the Ministry of Defence.??
Testifying before the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission in 2010 Jayasuriya had said ?Overall I was responsible for the conduct of the whole thing?.
Now Lt. Gen Jagath Jayasuriya was on the defensive saying he had no command responsibility during the war?s final phase. Moreover, the concepts of command and control were being made a mockery of by both antagonists. The on-going internecine crossfire between the Field Marshall and Lieutenant -General provided much entertainment to the casual observer. Sadly the verbal clash portrayed the armed forces in very poor light. The patriotic public of Sri Lanka which regards the Army as ?War Heroes? was aghast and dismayed. The two ex-Army Commanders were like school children blaming each other when being pulled up by the teacher for committing mischief.
The public spat between Fonseka and Jayasuriya may have continued further but for the intervention by present Army Commander Lt. Gen Mahesh Senanayake.?
The Army Chief went public saying that personal rivalries should not be allowed to sully the Sri Lankan Army?s reputation. He said that even if a single officer was criticised openly it affected the entire Army?s morale.?
Senanayake who had been victimised by the Rajapaksa regime in the belief that he was a confidante of Sarath Fonseka expressed displeasure over Fonseka?s outburst. The Army Chief pointed out that he had never criticised the Army though he (Senanayake) had been given a raw deal. He also clarified that only an allegation had been made in a foreign country against Jagath Jayasuriya and nothing else.

President Maithripala Sirisena
The highly respected Army commander?s response was widely welcomed. Senanayake?s public comments along with private efforts at peace making by senior political leaders paid dividends. There was an undeclared ceasefire between the Field Marshall and the Lt. General. The vocal artillery of the ex-top brass fell silent. Meanwhile President Maithripala Sirisena declared openly that he would not allow anyone ? to touch Jagath Jayasuriya or an Army officer or any war hero?.?
With the Government?s position on the allegations against Jayasuriya being made clear an uneasy peace has descended upon the two warring ex- army chiefs.
This clash of the two ex -army commanders cannot be viewed in isolation as a single, stand alone incident. There is a history of deep seated animosity behind the verbal duel that cannot be overlooked. The personality clash between Fonseka and Jayasuriya is a consequence of the politicisation process of the military that has been going on for more than half a century. This politicisation of the military assumed immense proportions during the Rajapaksa regime. In a bid to win the war against the tigers the armed forces were politicised to a very great extent.
?
He gave lots of media interviews with political overtones. The Defence Ministry website operating under Gota went to town regularly against Fonseka in favour of Mahinda Rajapaksa.
?
The intensified war resulting in victory over the LTTE brought about a host of unintended consequences in its wake.?
Chief among them was the birth and growth of the Fonseka phenomenon. This process underwent a drastic turn when the war winning Army Commander challenged the war winning President at the Presidential stakes. This brought about a sea change in the politico- military environment. The Army top brass was divided politically. Officers who would have been apolitical ?gentlemen? under normal circumstances turned into political animals. The Fonseka -Jayasuriya split was aggravated due to the Rajapaksas playing ?politics? with both. It would be relevant at this point to briefly delve into the history of the war winning Army Commanders? conflict with the Rajapaksas after the war was over and how this exacerbated the divide between Sarath Fonseka and Jagath Jayasuriya.
?
Medamulana and Valvettithurai
Mahinda Rajapaksa was elected Executive President on November 18, 2005. Despite being elected through an enforced boycott by the Tigers it soon became apparent that Medamulana and Valvettithurai were on a collision course. Mahinda Rajapaksa made two crucial appointments at the onset of his Presidency in anticipation of a savage war with the LTTE. One was to make his younger sibling Gotabaya Rajapaksa Defence Secretary. The other was to appoint Sarath Fonseka as Army Commander and extend his tenure.
It was at Gotabaya?s behest that Sarath Fonseka was made Army Chief. He was scheduled to retire as he would have reached the mandatory age 55 on December 6, 2005. But Gotabaya persuaded his brother to make Sarath Army Chief because Fonseka was the best man to lead the army at that point of time. The serving Commander Maj. Gen. Shantha Kottegoda was sent to Brazil as ambassador and Fonseka brought in. Thereafter his term was extended each year on December 6th his birthday. In May 2009 the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) organisation met its waterloo by the waters of Nandhikkadal lagoon, the lion?s share of credit for the victory against the Tigers was apportioned to the triad at the helm.?
The triumvirate comprising President Mahinda Rajapaksa, Defence Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa and Army Chief Sarath Fonseka was hailed for providing political, administrative and military leadership respectively in the triumphant war against the Tigers.
After the war ended the Rajapaksas of Ruhunu wanted to channel the war victory euphoria into electoral success for Mahinda at the presidential elections. They counted on Sarath Fonseka with his war victor image to engage in propaganda for the Machiavelli of Medamulana. Fonseka however had other ideas and thought of cashing in on his martial image for his own benefit instead of propping up the Medamulana oligarchy as expected. Unfortunately for the Rajapaksas their ?creature? like that of the monster created by Dr. Frankenstein had a mind of its own and refused to play second fiddle.
?
?Why Can?t I be the Next President?
On spirited occasions Sarath Fonseka has the tendency to fire off like loose cannon. Fonseka began talking of himself as the man who defeated the Tamils like the Rohana and began querying from friends and acquaintances in bantering tones ?Why can?t I be the next president??As far as Sarath was concerned it was he and not Mahinda who won the war and saved the country. As news of this changed attitude was conveyed to the Rajapaksa brothers the alarm bells started ringing. A real or imaginary threat to the Mahinda?s political fortunes was perceived.
There continued various irritants between the Rajapaksas and Fonseka. Some of the noteworthy ones included the one where former first Lady Shiranthi Rajapaksa and elder son Namal were stopped by the army on a journey to the north and were delayed unduly for hours. This was seen as being done at the behest of Fonseka himself.
On July 9 2009, Fonseka spoke at a book launch about the war in which he heaped compliments upon himself lavishly. Token lip service was paid to the President?s role. Gotabaya was virtually ignored. According to Sarath he and he alone had won the war with the President?s support. It was a one-man show. This implied that Sarath and not Mahinda was the saviour of the nation.
Another incident was the felicitation ceremony at Dharmasoka College, Ambalangoda on July 10 2009. All traffic was stopped along the Galle Road for hours. There were massive security arrangements made arbitrarily by Sarath?s security personnel causing much hardship to people. Sarath waxed eloquent about his role in winning the war alone to an appreciative home audience. There were increasing signs that Sarath and his merry-men in the Army were becoming a law unto themselves. It was as if a parallel authority was being exercised by Fonseka in certain spheres.
Sarath Fonseka had strong likes and dislikes. He despised some of his officers and discriminated against them unfairly while favouring others whom he liked. One of the senior officers who fell foul with him was Jagath Jayasuriya. Fonseka called him weak and inefficient and refused to let him go up to the frontlines. Jayasuriya the Wanni region Commander was kept in charge of administration and logistics but not allowed any battlefront duties. Jayasuriya however was a distant relative of the Rajapaksas and had access to both Mahinda and Gota. This irritated Fonseka further.
?
Aide De Camp Interrogated
In what was a very high-handed incident military officials acting under the orders of Fonseka arrested the aide de camp of Jagath Jayasuriya for questioning. The aide de camp was interrogated about the personal relationship he had with Jagath Jayasuriya.?
He was specifically asked about the time he allegedly spent in the company of Jayasuriya in the Wanni Commander?s chalet. The line of questioning aimed at establishing that a homosexual relationship existed between both. At one stage there was even a plan to arrest Jayasuriya also but when the Rajapaksas became aware of it the move was thwarted.
It was against this backdrop that the Mahinda Government made its move. Suddenly Fonseka?s world went crashing down. He was urgently summoned on July 12, 2009 and given three days to bow out as Army Chief and take over as Chief of Defence Staff (CDS). Reluctantly Fonseka submitted to the ultimatum and relinquished his Army Chief post and became CDS. His request that his close associate and Jaffna Commander Gen. Chandrasiri be made Army Chief was rejected. The Rajapaksas were in no mood to appoint someone close to Fonseka. Instead Jagath Jayasuriya ranking 9th in seniority was appointed Army Chief over the heads of eight others. Given Fonseka?s rebellious attitude the Rajapaksas wanted a trustworthy loyalist as Army commander. Jayasuriya fitted the bill perfectly. As Fonseka ?retired? on July 15th 2009 as Army Commander , he was succeeded by Jagath Jayasuriya as Army Chief on the same day. From Fonseka?s perspective this was adding insult to injury.
Though Fonseka remained as CDS , he found himself being undermined systematically within the Army by the new Commander. Exhibits pertaining to Fonseka were removed at the Army exhibition. His address at the Army 60th anniversary function was blacked out in the state and significant sections of the non-State media.
?
Chief of Defence Staff(CDS)
After Fonseka was kicked upstairs as Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) Jagath Jayasuriya the new Army Commander made a number of internal appointments, transfers and alterations within the military structure. Many of the Fonseka loyalists in sensitive posts were moved out to non-strategic positions. Strategically important positions were filled by persons hostile to Fonseka. The Fonseka effect was being steadily reversed. Even his staff at CDS was infiltrated by elements hostile to him. There was also much talk that Fonseka and those regarded as his loyalists were being monitored discreetly.
A thoroughly infuriated Sarath Fonseka then submitted his resignation coming into effect from December 1st 2009 to former Presidential Secretary Lalith Weeratunga at 1.30 pm on Thursday, November 12. The three-page letter outlining 17 reasons for quitting was promptly accepted as Mahinda Rajapaksa had given clear instructions that the resignation should be accepted if and when Fonseka submitted it. In that letter Fonseka made a specific complaint against Jagath Jayasuriya.
Here is the relevant excerpt-
?The present Army Commander immediately on assuming duties commenced transferring senior officers who immensely contributed to the war effort during my command tenure including those junior officers working with my wife at the Seva Vanitha Army Branch which was involved in looking after the welfare of the troops, was clearly to challenge the loyalty of officers and most discouraging to the officer corps of the Army, with a wrong signal being transmitted on my authority?.
?
Common Opposition Presidential Candidate
After resigning as CDS, Fonseka plunged into politics and became the common opposition presidential candidate. During the election campaign the ex-Army Chief was very outspoken. In that process he was very critical of the then government, former defence secretary and high-ranking officers from the defence services at that time. Fonseka also frequently played his favourite tune of claiming credit for the war victory.
In a bid to counter this, the Mahinda Government departed from military tradition and ?arranged? for serving army officers to speak out against Sarath Fonseka both directly and indirectly. The Rajapaksa regime also ensured that maximum propaganda mileage was derived from those militaristic pronouncements. Enhanced media coverage was provided.
Thus the country at large saw statements attributed to the serving Army Commander Lt. Gen. Jagath Jayasuriya being given wide publicity in the media. Some of these statements by Jayasuriya refuted Fonseka openly. Even internal meetings addressing military personnel within army premises by Jagath Jayasuriya found their way into the media courtesy of the Defence Ministry websites.
The then Army Spokesman Brig. Udaya Nanayakkara often exceeded his designated mandate by commenting specifically on matters related to Sarath Fonseka. Apart from this many other high-ranking army officers began giving media interviews. Chief among them was Maj. Gen. Shavendra Silva.?
Since Sarath Fonseka had referred critically to Shavendra Silva in an interview given to ?The Sunday Leader? the Major General had some reason for defending and clearing himself. Nevertheless the practice was not something desirable in the long run.
?
Part of a Political Agenda
Other army officers like Maj. Gen. Kamal Gunaratne, Maj. Gen. Chaggi Galage, Maj. Gen. Prasanna Silva, Maj. Gen. Kapila Hendavitharana and Maj. Gen. Prasad Samarasinghe also gave interviews to the state media. Most of these interviews ostensibly related to military matters and the war against the Tigers but there was no mistaking the patent political sub-text.?
They were all part of a political agenda aimed at undermining Sarath Fonseka and promoting Mahinda Rajapaksa. This type of brazen politicking by military officers was something unheard of in the not so distant past. All this happened under the watch of the newly appointed Army Commander Lt. Gen. Jagath Jayasuriya.
The conduct of former Defence Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa was extremely controversial during the election campaign. Despite the fact that he was a top Government Servant the then Defence Secretary engaged in open political discourse while addressing public meetings. He gave lots of media interviews with political overtones. The Defence Ministry website operating under Gota went to town regularly against Fonseka in favour of Mahinda Rajapaksa.
It was in such a situation that the country went to the Presidential Poll on January 26, 2010. Mahinda Rajapaksa defeated Sarath Fonseka. Thereafter the Rajapaksa regime came down hard on Sarath Fonseka and his supporters. The crackdown commenced immediately after the Election results were announced.

Horrific fire in Malaysia sparks outrage over unregulated religious schools

KUALA LUMPUR REUTERS Sept 15- Malaysia faced mounting calls for stronger regulation of religious schools following a horrific fire at an Islamic boarding school that killed 23 victims, most of them teenage boys trapped behind the barred windows of their dormitory. ??
?The fire broke out at a ?tahfiz? school where students learn to memorise the Koran. Malaysian officials said there had been 31 similar fire incidents in the past but Thursday?s fire was the worst seen in 20 years. ??
?But media reports said the numbers were much higher. National daily ?The Star? said 1,034 fires occurred in registered and unregistered religious schools from August 2015 to August 2017. Of these 211 were burnt to the ground, the newspaper said quoting data from the fire department. ? ? Family members of Mohamad Haikal Abdullah, a 12-year-old who died in the blaze, were furious after reports emerged that the only door at the school?s dormitory had caught fire and that the windows had metal bars, leaving the boys trapped and unable to escape. ?

JVP is for selected foreign investments: Anura Kumara
	
The Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) does not totally denounce foreign investments but welcome investments in selected areas, its leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake said on Thursday.
Mr Dissanayake made these comments at a seminar organized by ?We are Sri Lankans Circle.? ?Our party does not denounce foreign investors but welcome them to invest in selected areas. There are valuable natural resources in Pulmudai and the country only produces five kinds of chemicals using these resources. However Sri Lanka does not have sufficient technology to enhance the product portfolio using the natural resources found there. Therefore our party believes that foreign investment is needed in sectors such as these. Therefore we are for selected foreign investments,? the JVP leader said.
Speaking further, he said the JVP does not believe in an economy without a private sector but that the private sector should work according to a national plan. ?Our belief is that the private sector should not be allowed to work independently but work to a national plan,? he said.
?Our effort is not to convert Sri Lanka into another socialist nation like Russia or China. Russian shoes are too big for us to fill while Chinese shoes are too small. What we need is a pair of shoes which will fit us just like our founder leader Rohana Wijeweera once said? he added.
He said a national development plan was needed for the country to address major issues such as debt, how to make maximum use of our natural resources, development of human resources, stop corruption and should focus on history and culture.
Popular Musician and social activist Sunil Perera, who graced the occasion, was of the opinion that all politicians who governed the country for the last 70 years should be jailed. ?Politicians who governed the country during the past 70 years should be put in specially designed jail as all of them had been engaged in and have encouraged corruption,? he said. He said people should not be afraid to denounce all these politicians who belong to the main political parties of this country during future elections.
?India Gandhi was killed by a sheikh in 1984 but Manmohan Singh, also a Sikh, became the Prime Minister of that country while Abdul Kalaam became the President of India despite being a Muslim. Sri Lankan should learn from these examples when it comes to national unity and treat everyone equally,? he added. (Yohan Perera)

Lying to Parliament a grave offence: COPE Chair
	
Parliament Committee on Public Enterprises (COPE) Chairman JVP MP Sunil Handunnetti said yesterday that lying to Parliament was a grave offence.
He expressed these views in response to the evidence given to the Bond Commission by Perpetual Treasuries Limited (PTL) CEO Kasun Palisena that its owner Arjun Aloysius had lied to the COPE.
The MP said Parliament represented the sovereignty of the people and therefore lying to it was a punishable offense.
?These are officers and not politicians to come up with funny stories. They should behave responsibly. They have ultimately lied to the people of the country. However, this development is not the end and we have to wait and see how things proceed,? he told the Daily Mirror. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Over 200 inmates in Welikada and Bogambara Prisons on hunger strike
	
At least 150 remand prisoners, sentenced to death and serving life imprisonment in the Welikada Prison, launched a hunger strike yesterday, Prisons Spokesperson Thushara Upuldeniya said.
This follows close on the heels of a hunger strike launched by around 50 inmates of the Bogambara Prison on Thursday (14).
Upuldeniya said the Welikada remand prisoners, who had refused to eat since yesterday morning, were demanding to be paroled via a common pardon.
Upuldeniya said their demand would not be fulfilled immediately as they needed to wait for the recommendations of a committee headed by retired Supreme Court Judge Nimal Dissanayaka, appointed by the Justice Ministry in 2013, to decide on the fate of prisoners on death row.
Currently, Welikada Prison houses more than 200 prisoners on death raw and more than 150 serving life sentences.
Upuldeniya hinted that the hunger strike might be an attempt by some outside organization to sabotage the peaceful environment that exists in the prison system.
Speaking to the Daily Mirror, Attorney at Law Senaka Perera, representing the Committee for Protecting Rights of Prisoners said that more than 50 prisoners at the Bogambara prison were still refusing to eat.
?Prisoners in all the prisons, including the one in Bogambara, are living hellish lives, as all prisons lack even basic facilities. The authorities should open their eyes and take appropriate measures to solve these long-standing issues,? he said. (Piyumi Fonseka and J.A.L. Jayasinghe)

Palisena says he did not know about deleting phone records
	
PTL CEO Kasun Palisena yesterday said that he was unaware about any deletion of phone conversations from the recording system and he did not know about the crash of the main computer attached to the system, contrary to what PTL Chief dealer Nuwan Salgado and its IT head Sachit Devathantri testified before the PCoI earlier.
Earlier, Nuwan Salgaodo revealed before the Commission that he was asked to delete phone conversations by Kasun Palisena and based on that directive he asked Sachith Devathanri to delete several conversations that were found harmful to PTL. Mr. Devatantri also admitted earlier that he had crashed the main computer in order to avoid possible retrieval of that data. According to both witnesses testimonies it was revealed that Kasun Palisena was aware of the process of deletion and probably Arjun Aloysius as well.
DSG Gunatilleke, yesterday referring to particular CBSL regulations, showed that there was an obligation to protect electronic data relation to trading by a Primary Dealer and questioned Palisena on the deletion of several phone conversations.
DSG Gunatilleke: Did you know about these regulations?
W: yes
DSG: Did Aloysius know about the regulations
W: Yes
DSG: You received directions from the Commission to provide all the voice recordings in July, 2017, right?
W: Yes
DSG: So, you were complying with those directions, right?
W: Yes
DSG: Then how is it possible that some voice recordings were missing?
W: As far as I know, we have given every recording. I am only a dealer.
DSG: But you are the CEO, you are responsible for these. Nuwan Salgado earlier said the deletion happened on the instructions from you?
W: I was unaware about such a deletion
DSG: Now, tell me you are the CEO. Why would someone lower to you do such a deletion without your instructions?
W: I don?t get involved in IT matters. I didn?t know.
DSG: The conversations in which you were part of with Aloysius were also in those deleted phone recordings. And they carried very sensitive information, right?
W: Yes
DSG: So, How did you not know about these deletions?
W: I did not know
Witness Palisena was then repeatedly questioned by both the Commission and the DSG. But he maintained his stance that he was unaware about the deletion.
Justice Jayawardena: So, this deletion has to be done by someone from PTL, right?
W: Yes
J: So now you are saying this deletion had been done by a person without reference to you and that means any major act can be done without reference to you in the Company?
Witness? answer was not clear.
Justice Jayawardena was of the view that Palisena?s testimony so far drew the Commission?s attention on the credibility of it, because his answers were not towards something believable.
Justice Jayawardena further asked: Let me be clear, do you admit that these deleted conversations were critical and you were also part of it?
W: Yes
J: Do you admit that PTL had deleted it?
W: Yes
J: So, how would you not known about this deletion?
W: I did not know about it
Justice Jayawardena was of the view that in a company which has only about 25 employees, the witness? stance could not be acceptable.
PCoI Chairman Justice Chitrasiri at this point in a sarcastic manner quipped: It is like saying husband does not know about wife?s actions.
DSG Gunatilleke adding amusement to the cross examination said: ?This must be a problem with this witness dock?
However, the Commission and the DSG repeatedly questioned the witness but he continued to say: ?I didn?t know?. (Shehan Chamika Silva)
