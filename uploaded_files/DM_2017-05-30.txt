'Can't bear loss of Air Force son who saved me'
	
A woman who is being treated at the Karapitiya hospital after being rescued form a landslide site in Neluwa yesterday grieved over the death of the heroic Air Force officer who had saved the previous day.
She recalled how Sergeant Senaka Yaparathne of the Air Force had taken efforts under trying conditions to save her life.
A son from the Air Force came in a helicopter and put a belt around my waist. Then he took me in a canoe- like container. But I did not know that he had fallen down, I came to know later that he had died when I went to the hospital, said A.D. Gnanawathi who was rescued by Sergent Yaparatne was succumbed to his injuries after he fell off the helicopter during a rescue operation.
Gnanawathi, was under medical treatment in Karapitiya Teaching hospital after sustaining severe injuries due to a landslide that took place close to the Duwili ella tea factory rest room in Neluwa.
Gnanawathi further said, The officers came and informed us to leave the place when the landslide was about to occur. In the mean time, the rocks started coming down and we were not in a position to run. We were stuck in the front room. Those officers came and got us out but they could not take us out. We waited till dawn despite the rain. My two legs had got stuck in the concrete blocks. Therefore, they could not take us out
 In the morning, a helicopter came and they saved me. But I did not know that the son, who rescued me had fallen down and died when I was in hospital. I cant bear this incident., she lamented. (Sumathipala Diyagahage and D.G.Sugathpala)

Drama Comp 2017: The good, the bad and the mediocre
	

Because of the themes it engenders and certain demographic realities, the English theatre in Sri Lanka is limited to the Lionel Wendt. What transpired in 1956 and thereafter was, essentially, the bifurcation of our intelligentsia into swabasha and non-swabasha. The latter remain culturally hegemonic: they call the shots in our English Departments. The media helps propagate them, moreover, we already know that the English theatre is popularised by puff-piece sketches which champion its mere existence. The Sinhala theatre by contrast, is more vibrant, more profound, and at school level, the Samastha Lanka Natya Tharagawaliya is wider in scope than its English equivalents. I believe the same can be said of ourTamil theatre. 
I observed in an article written not too long ago that the English theatre in our schools tends to reinvent and reflect the English theatre elsewhere. What I meant there was that every positive and negative point about the latter can be gleaned from a school production, from the choice of subject-matter to the attitude of the playwright and the cast towards that subject-matter. Once in a while, one does come across an intelligent production, one that is formally and substantively refreshing. But thats rare. So rare, in fact that when it does come about, the reviewers tend to salivate. 
Drama Comp is an annual inter-school drama competition (the title makes it rather obvious) organised by the Interact Club of Royal College. The Interact Movement in this country teeters between community service projects and projects that celebrate the fact of being members of a particular clique. In the case of Drama Comp, its membership of that esoteric circle which rallies around Lionel Wendt. For the past 31 years it has tried to equal that other celebration of English theatre in Colombo, the inter-school Shakespeare Drama Competition. A few weeks ago it was held for the 32nd time. Heres a sketch of what I saw and the reflections it compelled in me. 
The theatre is rooted for the most in relationships and a sense of interconnectedness. The English theatre here is rooted even more so in those relationships, which is why most of its plays emphasise on a coming together of its characters. I am not sure whether the kind of separation we come across in Sinhala plays is absent in them because of the social content of their audiences (a largely conservative, urban middle and upper class). Before going any further, though, let me return to Drama Comp. 
Three of the four finalists at Drama Comp 2017 sustained that aforementioned conception of our English theatre: Ananda College, St Peters College and St Bridgets Convent. All these productions interested me immensely, but owing to spatial constraints, I can only pass over them. 
The Ananda College production echoed what I pointed out earlier in its very title: I Know You, one of those hyperlinked plots where we know the relations between the characters which even those characters do not know until the end.
The St Peters College production, meditative, jazzy, but basically self-brooding, examined the multidimensionality of the bully and the bullied. The St Bridgets production, the only non-original skit staged that evening, centred on its protagonists memories and fantasies as he grapples with the fact that hes sitting on an anti-personnel mine. I am not interested in pinpointing the flaws and demerits of these skits, rather to glean some larger and more relevant meaning from the entire event. 
Shakespeares plays thrive on conflict and drama. The former necessitates the latter: once theres no conflict, theres no drama. The 20th century, on the other hand, bred a set of playwrights who saw the dramatic in the un-dramatic, who were (as Susan Sontag observed) devoted to raking up private, rather than public, hells. Of course, Shakespeare was no different there but the likes of Arthur Miller and Pirandello brought about a form of theatre that is more at home here with Sinhala productions. In other words, our English theatre is fixated on the Shakespearean maxim that the dramatic subsists on conflict. Our Sinhala theatre in comparison, has evolved. 
Isnt it ironic and interesting that the best continental playwrights  Chekhov, Strindberg, Ibsen, Brecht, and Beckett  have been the darlings of our Sinhala and not English playwrights Jayantha Chandrasiris plays owe considerably to Beckett, while Dharmasena Pathiraja graduated to the cinema with Koraya saha Andaya, an Absurdist tract which found its cinematic equivalent in his patently nihilistic Soldadu Unnahe. The late Premaranjith Tilakaratne found his Big Theme  the father-son conflict  in Strindberg, while both Henry Jayasena and Parakrama Niriella toyed around with Brechts Caucasian Chalk Circle. 
To be sure, Sinhala plays arent perfect. Many of those who took to the English kitchen sink drama in the sixties and the political wave which swept our theatre in the seventies (barring the pioneers, Sugathapala de Silva and Pathiraja included) confused form for substance and skewed the latter in their work. That is why they resorted to symbols and metaphors, which their heirs subsist on even today. They are the theatrical equivalent of what Pauline Kael referred to as movie brutalists: they were tired of the stylised craftsmanship of Maname, Sinhabahu and those who were tutored under and pandered to Professor Sarachchandra. 
There are no brutalists in our English theatre, just as there are no brutalists in our English literati and intelligentsia. I believe this has much to do with the social content of those who frequent the Wendt. They are, as I pointed out before, largely urbanised and conservative. It is that conservative streak which inhibits them from doing the hard yards the Sinhala theatre has. Even in our schools. 
The Sinhala theatre is focused on open characters who have something to hide. The English theatre is focused on repressed characters who want to get out. This discrepancy cant really be rationalised: it exists because of that conservative streak among those who go to the Wendt. Because of that streak, they can only be insular.
And like all insular people, they desire to reveal, not hide. The best productions, on that count and in the English theatre, are those which stray away from this trend. 
Which brings me back to Drama Comp. The winner this year was Methodist College, whose production TTYL was, as far as I could make it out, a visual distillation of contemporary angst. By disassociating speech from performance, it succeeded in depicting the alienation perpetuated by social media. It was fun to watch, not least because it was free of the formal constraints which characterised the other productions. The Ananda, St Peters, and St Bridgets skits were conservative in that sense. They could only affirm humanity. TTYL however, didnt affirm humanity, simply because it didnt feel it had to. I could hence only gasp at the transitions in it, accompanied by excerpts from classical music, including Beethovens Ninth, the Blue Danube and the First Movement (Spring) from Vivaldis Four Seasons. 
I sound pessimistic here. I didnt intend to. But year after year, I am tired, baffled and even angered by the kind of insularity the English theatre, literati and cinema (yes, we do have an independent English cinema) breed. The Methodist production at Drama Comp 2017 was refreshing. How many such productions do we come across at the Wendt I see David Mamet has come back, though I unfortunately missed Glengarry Glenn Ross. But for every Mamet, we get Hugo, Leroux, and Shaw. Likewise, for every standalone TTYL, we get three other not-so-standalone skits. The only consolation I therefore can get, which the judges at Drama Comp and the organisers from the Interact Club of Royal College delivered to me that night was the fact that it won. Yes, they win. Yes, they are cheered on. And how.

300,000 evacuated as cyclone makes landfall in Bangladesh
	
Nearly 300,000 people have been evacuated from southern coastal areas of Bangladesh as a cyclone dubbed Mora made landfall Tuesday morning local time.
"More people were still waiting for evacuation," said Abu Syed Mohammad Hashim, acting director general of the country's Disaster Management Department. Authorities have also shut airports and ports in the regions expected to be worst hit.
Residents were seeking shelter in schools and other safe buildings in 17 coastal districts, Hashim said. Officials have organized 3,800 relief centers ahead of the storm.
Medical teams have been formed and doctors and nurses have had their leave requests canceled in anticipation of the storm's landfall, according to Bangladeshi state media.
Hashim told the state-run news agency BSS that rescue teams comprised of members of the armed forces and other agencies were also on standby.
Mora was forecast to make landfall near the southeastern tourist city of Cox's Bazar and the seaport city of Chittagong, the Bangladesh Meteorological Agency said.
Mora is the equivalent of a strong tropical storm and will bring winds around 100 kilometers per hour as it moves onshore, said CNN meteorologist Taylor Ward. A more significant problem than the winds will be the potential for flooding -- from storm surge and heavy rainfall, he said.
"The coastline of Bangladesh is very low-lying and is prone to storm surge problems," Ward said. "Additionally, tropical cyclones in the region bring extremely heavy rainfall which often turns deadly in the densely populated areas."
Some low-lying areas of Cox's Bazar are already underwater due to an unusually high tide, state media reports.
The country's two main seaports in Chittagong and Mongla have suspended container handling, and river transports across Bangladesh have been suspended. Chittagong and Cox's Bazar have been advised to hoist the number 10 warning signal -- the highest level -- and other areas the lesser number eight signal.
The airports of Chittagong and Cox's Bazar have also been closed; Cox's Bazar indefinitely and Chittagong's Shah Amanat International Airport until at least 2 p.m. local time (4 a.m. ET) Tuesday.
"We will reopen the airport if weather permits after 2 p.m. tomorrow... the suspension period will linger if the brunt of cyclone badly affects our airport infrastructure," CAAB flight safety director Ziaul Kabir is quoted as saying.
With about 700 kilometers of coast line, Bangladesh is exposed to cyclones and is often battered by deadly storms.
At the southern end of the Bay of Bengal, Sri Lanka has been experiencing heavy monsoon rains and severe flooding, which have left at least 160 people dead and dozens more missing. The two weather systems, however, are unrelated, according to CNN meteorologist Pedram Javaheri. (CNN)

FCID phobia hampering relief process: PHU
	
The Financial Crimes Investigation Division (FCID) is one of the main obstacles to provide relief to the victims of floods and landslides as it is slowing down the process of providing relief , the Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) claimed yesterday.
It said though President Maithripala Sirisena had instructed officials to provide maximum relief to the victims without being restricted to circulars, the officials complain that they too would be summoned by the FCID for providing relief to the victims.
In the recent past, action was taken against a presidential secretary and a number of other officials for violating circulars. One ministry secretary was remanded for 152 days. Therefore, this FCID phobia had affected the process of relief proving today as officials are afraid to take action, PHU General Secretary MP Udaya Gammanpila told a news conference.
He said a government of theirs wont take action against officials who provide relief to the people by violating circulars.
Meanwhile, expressing condolences to the victims of the floods and landslides, the MP said the prevailing calamity is more of a man-made disaster than a natural one.
The rainfall caused havoc because the country received a large amount of rainfall within a short span of time. The Global warming is the reason for this heavy rainfall. The water gets evaporated from the sea and stored in atmosphere through condensation. Thereafter, we receive heavy rains through monsoonal winds. Our rivers and streams dont have the capacity to hold that many rainfalls, he said.
He said methane and carbon are the main reason for global warming. The MP said electric appliances emit carbon to the air while garbage releases methane. When trees are cut, the source of absorbing carbon also gets terminated worsening the issue, he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Fears for 2,000 people trapped in  Philippine city battle
	
AFP MARAWI, Philippines, May29, 2017- Security forces traded heavy gunfire with Islamist militants inside a southern Philippine city Monday, as fears grew for up to 2,000 people unable to escape a week of fighting that has left women and children among the dead. 
President Rodrigo Duterte imposed martial law across the southern third of the Philippines shortly after the fighting erupted, warning the gunmen were involved in an effort by the Islamic State group to set up a local caliphate. 
But street-to-street battles and a relentless military bombing campaign has so far failed to end the crisis in Marawi, one of the biggest Muslim cities in the mainly Catholic Philippines, and authorities expressed alarm about the fate of those trapped. 
They are texting us and calling us for help, Zia Alonto Adiong, spokesman for the provincial crisis management committee, said of the 2,000 people his office had recorded being unable toleave areas held by the militants.

The Hambantota Port Development Project (HPDP) agreement with China Merchants Port Holdings Co. Ltd (CM Port) will be renegotiated to achieve a win-win situation with crucial discussions to be held on Friday, Ports and Shipping Minister Mahinda Smarasinghe said.
He told the weekly SLFP news briefing today that national interests would under any circumstances be compromised but the US$1.4 billion equity swap with the Chinese Company extremely necessary to ease Sri Lankas debt servicing and strengthen foreign reserves.
The minsiter said he would try his best to make the US$1.4 billion joint venture to be based on a 60 - 40, 70 - 30 or even a 51 - 49 percent equity equity swap.
He said there would be no selling or leasing of 15,000 acres of land to China for 90 years in the Hambantota district to set up an exclusive economic zone. The lease period will definitely be less than 90 years.There will be no selling of lands or properties to the Chinese. There will be no violation of the laws of the land. There will be new clauses and a new agreement.
Since I assumed duties as the Minister of Ports and Shipping I did a thorough study on the all aspects of the HPDP and I have decided as the minister in charge to renegotiate the framework agreement signed by the Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA) and the CM Port," the minister said.

A group of white collar high-ups of an establishment connected to air traffic had a severe disappointment when their political authority was not moved out as expected when the pack was reshuffled recently.

This group of white collar high-ups had made representations to the high political authorities urging that the purohita concerned be moved out as soon as they heard that a reshuffle of the top team was in the offing.
The purohita has incurred the wrath of high-ups when he had issued strict instructions to cut down on extravagant expenditure on unnecessary foreign trips, seminars and conferences. Hence their disappointment.

Human Rights activists call for release of  prisoners held under PTA
	

In Sri Lanka, the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA) and the Emergency Regulations introduced to combat LTTE terrorism and other Tamil militant groups are considered by Human Rights activists to be draconian pieces of legislation. They charge that those detained under the PTA are unjustifiably remanded for decades with no charges against them or charges which are based on confessions made to police officers under duress. Human Rights activists claim that apart from the injustice faced at the hands of the police and the prison officials, they also undergo harassment from fellow prisoners. These prisoners detained under the PTA are constantly referred to by the Tamil politicians and Human Rights activists as Political Prisoners. 
Sri Lanka has had a history of certain abuses targeting prisoners under PTA. As a result of unrest created between those held under PTA and other non-Tamil prisoners in the past, those detained under the PTA and the Emergency Regulations are now exclusively housed at the New Magazine prison. However they are sent to the Welikada Prison Hospital for medical treatment. 
Velayutham Varatharajan, remanded at the New Magazine Prison, was implicated in an attempt to assassinate former President Chandrika Kumarathunga. He was convicted by the High Court of Colombo under the PTA for aiding and abetting the attempt. His appeal is currently pending at the Court of Appeal. On April 22, he had fallen sick and was admitted to the Welikada prison hospital. Initially he was admitted to the open ward. Thereafter he had been moved to the cell section in the hospital which is similar to a prison cell. K.S. Ratnavale, human rights activist and senior lawyer who is appearing on behalf of Varatharajan said that most PTA detainees were directed to this cell section. This is not because of prison overcrowding but simply because they are political detainees and are of a particular ethnicity, he said.
Varatharajan, who is under medication for hypertension, had refused to go to the cell section. He had been writhing in pain and doctors expressed suspicion that he may have contracted dengue. Despite his condition, the Officer-in-charge had moved him to the cell section and he had to sleep on the floor. The doctor who checked him the next day recommended that he should be admitted to the National hospital. But he was not taken and the officers assaulted and verbally abused him saying that he was from the Magazine prison and therefore should not be taken. Even the doctors recommendation is not taken seriously, said Ratnavale. 
According to Ratnavale, the treatment at the Welikada prison hospital is very basic. They only have a few painkillers and other basic medicines. Drugs prescribed to patients are not available. Though there is a procedure to bring drugs from outside, it is cumbersome and time-consuming. There are no X ray facilities. They are willfully keeping the standards low. The prison hospital only serves politicians convicted by courts or remanded. People like Duminda Silva who have been sentenced to death are in the Open ward, though they are not sick. But the truly sick are neglected, added Ratnavale. 
Unable to bear the discriminatory attitude of the prison authorities and the horrific conditions under which he was placed, Varatharajan had pleaded with the doctor to be released from the hospital. However, the doctor had refused as his condition was serious. Varatharajan persistently said he would take responsibility. Consequently he was sent back. 
Ratnavale said that when doctors recommend prisoners to be taken to the National Hospital for treatment under the PTA, they have to be escorted. However this escort is not available at all times. When there is no escort, despite the patients helpless cries and the doctors recommendation, the patient is not taken. They are taken to the hospital only when the Court orders it. It takes a few days to get a Court Order, said Ratnavale. 
Step-motherly treatment is given to prisoners, so much so that prisoners dont want to go to the prison hospital. It is ill-equipped and officers are racist. Minor staff members are convicted criminals who are themselves racist. They often assault these prisoners, said Ratnvale. According to recent reports, at least 15 prisoners work as nurses at the Welikada prison hospital. Though there are six main wards in the Prison with nearly 300 patients, there are only three nursing officers. According to Health Ministry sources, the provision of nursing staff falls under the purview of the Prison Department. 
Another prisoners blood sugar level went very high and his left side was almost paralyzed. When he was admitted to the prison hospital, they refused to give him treatment. He was kept there for a long time and wasnt given any food. Though the doctor had recommended urgent treatment, the Commissioner General said that was not the case, Ratnavale added, pointing out how the doctors recommendation was overridden by top prison officials. As a result of the step motherly treatment at the Welikada Prison hospital, political prisoners now plead for an established medical centre at the magazine prison.  Attorney-at-Law Suren D. Perera said that in 2013, when a victim was severely tortured at the Bogambara Remand prison, he had been denied admission to the General Hospital, as the General Hospital doctors inquired about injuries and refered them to the JMO and the police if they suspected there had been a human rights violation. 


Political prisoners or not
The government has repeatedly stated that there were no political prisoners in the country. When asked about this claim, Fr. Sherard Jayawardane said the statement was unacceptable. In 1971 and 1989, JVP Sinhalese youth fought for a political cause. Similarly, the LTTE also fought for a political cause. They wanted freedom and therefore it was a political cause, he said, adding that the governments claim was merely a cover up. Speaking to Daily Mirror at a protest held recently by the National Movement for Release of Political Prisoners, he stressed that the government should release all political prisoners. He added that the disadvantaged Tamil minority had not still been offered a political solution for their predicaments which are manifold. 

Are all PTA detainees LTTE sympathizers
Not all detainees are hardcore LTTE supporters. Daily Mirror learns reliably that while leaders of the LTTE have escaped imprisonment, a majority detained under the PTA are merely implicated, had no part in the master plans and have been in remand for years. According to Perera, political prisoners in the Kandy remand prison are not hardcore LTTE cadres. They are upcountry Tamils who have lived in estates for a very long time. The LTTE have bribed them with money or beer, to entice them to provide their three-wheelers and other assistance as needed, he said.  The hardcore LTTE leaders have not been arrested. Through my clients, I have learned that the LTTE leader in Kandy was not arrested. He has gone to Malaysia, added Perera. 

The Prevention of Terrorism Act
The repeal of the Prevention of Terrorism Act No.48 of 1979 (PTA), has been repeatedly demanded by Human Rights activists. The PTA introduced in 1979 was intended to be a temporary measure. However in 1982, the PTA was made a permanent law in the country. Under the Evidence Ordinance, confessions made to police officers are not admissible before courts. This Ordinance was introduced by the British who were well aware of the notoriety of police officers for torturing inmates and obtaining confessions. However according to the PTA, confessions made to police officers above the rank of Assistant Superintendent of Police (ASP) are admissible. Yet activists point out that the practice of torture is prevalent even among top officials. 
Ratnavale said that nearly 99% of cases filed under the PTA were based solely on the confessions of the accused which were more often than not, extracted by inflicting fear and under duress.  Usually the prosecution proves the case against the accused. However, the PTA mandates that the burden of proof lies on the accused. In most cases, the main evidence is the confession. In the Voir Dire inquiry, we must prove that the confession was extracted under duress. So the burden of proof lies with the accused, explained Perera. He pointed out that in practice, it was extremely difficult to prove that a confession was extracted under duress as there would be no witnesses to speak on behalf of the accused. So in most cases the accused pleads guilty, he pointed out. 
Bail cannot be granted under the PTA and therefore many who have been implicated in LTTE-related violence have been in remand for decades. The PTA permits arbitrary arrests without warrants. 
They can be housed in unofficial places such as STF and army camps, said Perera. Activists point out that the worst forms of human rights abuses take place in these unofficial detention centres.  Perera also noted a hesitance on the part of judges and state counsels to initiate trials as they were time-consuming. As a result, trials are postponed. Perera further pointed out that plea bargaining was no longer in use, which has also restricted the options available to political prisoners. In plea bargaining, the defence counsel bargains with the state counsel and the judge on a punishment before the case is called. Then at the trial the accused pleads guilty and the decided punishment is given, which is most often a reduced sentence. They amend the indictment for lesser charges for which there are no minimum charges. Then the judge can give a lesser sentence. Before February this year, the Attorney Generals Department had a policy to amend the charges under the PTA, where there was no damage to property or life. But they no longer amend charges, he said.  The Counter Terrorism Bill which is to replace the PTA has been approved by the Cabinet. However, activists have pointed out that it is more draconian that the PTA. 

Other concerns
Cases based solely on a confession rejected by court should be withdrawn. However, this has not been the case with regards to charges against those detained under the PTA. There is a trial going on in the High Court of Colombo based on the confession rejected in the Vavuniya High Court. Although the lawyers made submissions that the confession has to be rejected, the Attorney General did not consent to it, said Ratnavale. 
He added, In another trial, the confession made by a former police officer who has been in remand for the past eight years was rejected. But there are four other cases against him based on the same confession. When cases with confessions rejected by a court are proceeded with by another court, it affects the consistency of judicial decisions. 

Legal framework
Sri Lanka has ratified the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment and the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. Sri Lanka is a signatory to the Geneva Convention. Further, local statutes such as the Constitution and the Torture Act are supposed to protect people from arbitrary arrest and torture. The PTA however, contravenes provisions in them.

A timeline of major incidents affecting those held under PTA

1983- During the Black July riots, 50 Tamil prisoners were gruesomely killed at the Welikada prison. Prison authorities had allegedly encouraged convicts to attack the political detainees. Compensation was paid to the families of the victims consequent to cases filed in the District Court of Colombo by the Civil Rights Movement, spearheaded by the late Desmond Fernando P.C. who was twice President of the Bar Association of Sri Lanka (BASL) and Ms. Surya Wickremasinghe.
2000- Two prisoners at the Kalutara prison were killed as a result of being attacked by fellow prisoners and guards. PTA detainees had organized a memorial event to commemorate leading politician and lawyer Kumar Ponnambalam on January 7, 2000. Prison authorities, angered by this gesture, opened the compound of the convicts who pounced on the political prisoners. Though the perpetrators were identified at the inquest, the Attorney Generals Department did not prosecute or pursue the matter. However the family of Sivaratnam Sri Kumar who was killed, filed a civil case for damages before the District Court of Kalutara. They received compensation of a reasonable sum. The Attorney Generals Department appealed against the award of compensation but the order of the Kalutara District Court was affirmed by the Appellate Court.
2012- When prisoners protested against certain measures taken by the prison authorities at the Vavuniya prison, the Special Task Force was brought in on the orders of the leaders of the previous government. The STF allegedly assaulted the prisoners who sustained grave injuries. The twenty prisoners were taken to the Anuradhapura prison in the middle of the night where they were allegedly further assaulted. That same night they were then taken to the Mahara prison, where officers finally decided to direct them to the hospital. However two prisoners succumbed to their injuries.

PTA detainees are not discriminated within prisons
D.M. Swaminathan- Minister of Prison Reforms, Rehabilitation and Resettlement and Hindu Religious Affairs
Speaking to Dailymirror, D.M. Swaminathan, the Minister of Prison Reforms, Rehabilitation and Resettlement, dismissed allegations that PTA detainees were discriminated within prisons. If there is any discrimination and if I am informed, I will handle it. I will take steps immediately, he said. 
According to him there are 72 detainees under remand custody whose cases are pending at various High Courts and whose trials are at different stages. Out of them, 57 are Tamils, 9 are Sinhalese and 6 are Muslims, he said. The total number of cases pending at the Attorney General Department is 16. The total number of suspects is 29. Sixteen are Tamil, 8 are Sinhalese and five are Muslim. Out of the sixteen files, four indictments are being prepared and three have been recommended to be discharged. So these seven files will be over within another months time, he added.  When asked about reports claiming prisoners were performing the duties of nurses, he said that if they were employed, they would be paid. According to my knowledge, if prisoners are employed it is good as they get paid. They work in the prison hospital and not outside, so what is the harm There is nothing wrong about that, he said. 

The total number of cases pending at the Attorney General Department is 16. The total number of suspects is 29. Sixteen are Tamil, 8 are Sinhalese and five are Muslim.


They should be granted general amnesty, rehabilitated or bailed out
Mano Ganesan- Minister of National Co-existence Dialogue and Official Languages
Mano Ganesan, Minister of National Co-existence Dialogue and Official Languages said when the current government came to power there were around 200 detained under the PTA and this number has reduced to nearly 100. This is a favourable and progressive step. Yet, we have to address the issues of the rest in detention under the PTA, he added. 
Stressing that the PTA had to be repealed, he said the government had pledged to the nation and international community to do so. This is going to be replaced by the Counter Terrorism Act. Its draft has been debated nationally and internationally. There are many negative opinions expressed to the extent that people claim it is more draconian than the PTA. This is a point to ponder over. But we cant simply reject it. Though is has been drafted and has gone through the cabinet, it has to be amended before it comes to the parliament, he said. 
Referring to those still detained, he suggested that they should be granted general amnesty, rehabilitated or bailed out. Certain prisoners have been sentenced. But they have already spent 15 to 25 years in remand. They should be given general amnesty similar to how amnesty was granted to the southern insurgents in the 70s and 80s, Ganesan said. Others whose trials are ongoing should be bailed out or should be sent to rehabilitation centres. After the rehabilitation period of six months or one year, they should be sent home. When it comes to those who were not sentenced or charged but detained for investigation, they should be released immediately on bail, he added.

There are no political prisoners in Sri Lanka. There are only criminal offenders
Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe-Minister of Justice and Buddha Sasana
When asked about the governments stance with regards to the campaign to release political prisoners, Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe, Minister of Justice firmly maintained that there was not a single Tamil political prisoner in Sri Lanka. There are only criminals. After Sarath Fonsekas case there have not been any political prisoners in Sri Lanka, he said. 
The Counter Terrorism Act is only a proposal. The law is the PTA. We have not applied it during the recent past, he added.

Detainees are those whose trials are ongoing before courts or
who have been charged
Thushara Upuldeniya-Prison Media Spokesperson
Refuting the allegations made by activists Thushara Upuldeniya, the Prison Media Spokesperson reiterating the Minister of Justice, said there were no political prisoners in Sri Lanka. Detainees are those whose trials are ongoing before courts or who have been charged, he said.  When asked about the discrimination faced by those detained under the PTA, he said nothing of the sort had been reported to him. Responding to the allegation that prisoners perform the duties of nurses he said this was untrue. There is a shortage of nurses and prison officials. We have received permission to recruit people. As a temporary measure, we have decided to recruit retired nurses, he said. He added that there were no life-threatening shortcomings at the prison hospital and that facilities such as X-rays were available. 
However, when asked about the structure of the Welikada prison hospital, the media spokesperson refused to disclose information for security reasons.

Indignity he suffered was of his own seeking!
	

A certain head of a department having direct dealings with the general public had invited the subject purohita to a regular official conference with the divisional heads of the department.

At this conference held at the departmental headquarters preceded by a meditation session, the head of the department exhorted his divisional chiefs to set an example to their subordinates by performing their duties efficiently and diligently.
While the conference was underway, the purohita concerned arrived  and the head of the department invited him to address the divisional chiefs.
And the purohita addressing the conference berated the head of department for his inefficiency and various acts of commission and omission on his part. Visibly flabbergasted by this unexpected harangue, the poor head of department was seen cringing and squirming cutting a sorry figure before his subordinate officers.
Most participants who later discussed this unexpected development had observed that the shelling their boss received was something of his own seeking!

JO wants circular ensuring safety of public servant
	
The joint opposition (JO) today requested President Maithripala Sirisena to issue a circular ensuring the safety of government servants who are providing relief to flood and landslide-affected people disregarding standard protocols and circulars.
It said though the President had requested officers to disregard circulars when providing relief, the officers were not keen to take effective decisions or to take a risk because they fear action against them.
As soon as the government came to power, it questioned more than 200 soldiers about money spent to provide relief to flood victims in 2014. The army obtained Rs.50 million to uplift the livelihood of those living in flooded-affected areas and returned the balance Rs.26 million to the government. The transaction was transparent. Even former Army Commander Daya Ratnayake was questioned on this matter. Against such a background, soldiers and other officers shy away from taking prompt action, MP Bandula Gunawardena said today.
He said this was why the President, as the Minister of Defence, should assure the officers who take action in good faith would not be faulted.
The MP said the present state mechanism appeared to be faily passive during the disaster while media institutions and other organizations are providing relief.
He said funds allocated to the Housing and Constructions Ministry to construct housing units across the country should be utilized to build and refurbish houses for the landslide and flood victims.
The MP also requested the government to hold meetings chaired by district secretaries on how best to coordinate the provision of relief to the victims and discuss the other measures that needed to be taken in this situation. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Merkel warns: US, Britain no longer reliable partners
	
FRANKFURT MAIN AFP May28, 2017- Europe must take its fate into its own hands faced with a western alliance divided by Brexit and Donald Trumps presidency, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said Sunday. 
The times in which we could completely depend on others are on the way out. Ive experienced that in the last few days, Merkel told a crowd at an election rally in Munich, southern Germany.

We Europeans truly have to take our fate into our own hands, she added.  While Germany and Europe would strive to remain on good terms with America and Britain, we have to fight for our own destiny, Merkel went on.  Special emphasis was needed on warm relations between Berlin and newly-elected French President Emmanuel Macron, she said. 
The chancellor had just returned from a G7 summit which wound up Saturday without a deal between the US and the other six major advanced nations on upholding the 2015 Paris climate accords.  Merkel on Saturday labelled the result of the six against one discussion very difficult, not to say very unsatisfactory. Sundays event saw Merkel renew bonds with the Christian Social Union (CSU), Bavarian sister party to her own centre-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU), ahead of a parliamentary vote in September.

North Korea fires missile into Sea of Japan
	

North Korea test-fired a missile Monday into Japans maritime economic zone -- the latest in a series of provocative launches that have ratcheted up tensions over its nuclear weapons ambitions. 
It was the Norths third ballistic missile test in as many weeks and the 12th this year -- carried out in defiance of UN sanctions warnings and US threats of possible military action. 
US military monitors said the short-range missile flew for six minutes, while Japan said it fell into the countrys exclusive economic zone (EEZ) -- waters extending 200 nautical miles from its coast. 
The launch comes in fresh defiance of tough talk from US President Donald Trump, who promised last week at the G7 summit that the big problem of North Korea will be solved. 
The latest, a short-range Scud, flew about 450 kilometres (280 miles) before landing in the Sea of Japan (East Sea) between the Korean peninsula and Japan, the US Pacific Command said. 
Mondays test also marked the second time this year that a North Korean missile fell provocatively close to its neighbour Japan. 
It emerged North Korean leader Kim Jong Un supervised the test of a new anti-aircraft weapon system and ordered its mass production and deployment throughout the country, after weeks of defiant ballistic missile tests. 
Norths KCNA news agency did not report the exact nature of the weapon or the time of the test but said it was organised by the Academy of National Defence Science (ANDS).

Public servants need not fear to break law to carry out relief ops.: Eran
	
Public servants need not be afraid of being faulted in case of circumventing laid-down procedures to help the flood and landslide-affected, Public Enterprise Development Deputy Minister Eran Wickramaratne said today.
He said priority at this moment should be to help the victims and not to bring down vehicles.
The deputy minister said the government had requested all state banks to help small and medium business enterprises which has been affected by the floods. However, he said an assessment as to the extent of the damage or the number of such business that have been affected.
The deputy minister said it was essential to obtain the services of geological experts to carry out a test on the composition of Sri Lanka's soil to determine the underlying causes for the landslides. One of the reasons may be the movement of the top soil but a proper study has to be made so that government could take necessary steps to prevent landslides in the future, he said and underscored the fact most of those who died were from landslides rather than from the floods.
