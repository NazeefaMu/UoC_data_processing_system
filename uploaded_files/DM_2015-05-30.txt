Video: Bandula challenges Harsha, Ravi for TV debate
	
UPFA Parliamentarian Bandula Gunawardane today challenged Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake or Policy Planning and Economic Development deputy minister Harsha de Silva for a debate on any television channel over the current economic crisis in the country.
Mr. Gunawardane told a news conference that Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake and Central Bank Governor Arjuna Mahendran had given false information at a news conference yesterday with regard to the economic situation in the country.
I, as a person who has worked in Finance Ministry and who had held various ministerial portfolios, am ready to come to an open debate on any television channel about the lies that the finance Minister had told yesterday to the country and the world. 
Mr. Gunawardane said he was ready to debate economic factors such as the bond issue in the Central Bank, interest rates, unemployment and the exchange rate.
He said the country was unprecedently going backward in every aspect economically, politically and culturally under the rule of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe. (Ajith Siriwardana)WATCH

No agreement on electoral reforms by UPFA allies: Dinesh
	
Mahajana Eksath Peramuna (MEP) Leader Dinesh Gunawardane said yesterday that no agreement had been reached among the constituent parties of the United People's Freedom Alliance (UPFA) on the proposed electoral reforms though it had been claimed otherwise in various quarters.
Mr. Gunawardane told the Daily Mirror his party was opposed to the increase in the number of parliamentary seats to 255. Likewise, he said the three leftist parties- the Democratic Left Alliance, Lanka Sama Samaja Party (LSSP) and the Communist Party had associated themselves with the MEP in certain aspects on the electoral reforms.
"There is no agreement among all the parties. It has not been discussed who has the authority to appoint members on the National List. Is it the party leader concerned who should nominate members to the National List slots" he asked.
Mr. Gunawardane also said he spearheaded the Parliamentary Select Committee on Electoral Reforms, but his recommendations had been disregarded in the evolution of the present set of proposals for a change in the parliamentary election system.
"We, in the Select Committee, entertained public views for the evolution of our reforms. It is a parliamentary body. What is the use of a Parliamentary Select Committee if its proposals are disregarded," he asked.
Mr. Gunawardane charged that the present set of proposals, available for discussion, had emerged out of the blues from the President's Office.
"We are answerable to the general public. We stick to the Select Committee proposals," he said.( Kelum Bandara )

Video: No-faith motion against PM has no impact to 20A -  GL
	
A no-confidence motion against Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe would have no impact to the enactment of the 20A because the President could appoint a new Prime Minister, who had the majority support in Parliament after the motion, UPFA Parliamentarian G.L. Peiris said today.
We have assured our fullest support to the 20 A. The no-confidence motion against Prime Minister is not connected to it. President has a Constitutional responsibility to appoint a new Prime Minister who has the majority support in Parliament after the no-confidence motion. Then the 20 A could be enacted by the Government with the majority in Parliament, he said.
Dr. Peiris said Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe should take complete responsibility with regard to the bond issue in the Central Bank.
It was Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe who appointed a person who was not loyal to Sri Lanka. According to our Constitution, Central Bank Governor Arjuna Mahendran cannot work without taking oath in Sri Lanka. He is someone who has taken oath in another country and rejected loyalty to this country. So, he does not have any right to do any task in the Central Bank, he said.
He said Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe did everything possible to cover up this and added that if a no-confidence motion was not brought against such a person, it would be unpatriotic. (Ajith Siriwardana)WATCH
