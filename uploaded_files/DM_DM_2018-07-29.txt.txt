Deadly quake hits Indonesia tourist spot
	
A powerful earthquake has struck a popular tourist destination in Indonesia, killing at least 10 people.
The 6.4 magnitude quake hit the central Indonesian island of Lombok just before 07:00 local time (00:00 GMT) on Sunday.
The island attracts tourists from around the world and is located about 40km (25 miles) east of Bali.
Many buildings have been damaged and dozens of people have been injured, officials say.
The US Geological Survey said the epicentre of the earthquake was 50km (31 miles) northeast of the city of Mataram, in northern Lombok.
It was followed by more than 60 smaller earthquakes, with the largest recorded at a magnitude of 5.7.
"Some 40 people are injured and dozens of houses were damaged," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the country's disaster agency, said in a statement.
"We estimate the number will keep rising because we are not done collecting data," he added.
"The main focus now is evacuation and rescue. Some of the injured are still being treated at clinics."
He posted images showing collapsed buildings and streets littered with rubble.
One witness told AFP news agency about the chaos that followed the earthquake.
"The earthquake was very strong... and everybody in my house panicked, we all ran outside," he said. "All my neighbours also ran outside and the electricity was suddenly cut off."
Indonesia is prone to earthquakes because it lies on the Ring of Fire - the line of frequent quakes and volcanic eruptions that circles virtually the entire Pacific rim.
More than half of the world's active volcanoes above sea level are part of the ring. (BBC)

Reduction of retirement benefit: Over 300 ex-SLAF officers complain to CA
	
The Court of Appeal fixed for argument on November 13 the Writ petition filed by more than 300 retired Air Force officers complaining of the reduction of their entitlement to the total Retirement Benefit under a purported amendment.
The Bench comprised Justices P. Pathman Surasena (President/CA) and Arjuna Obeysekera.
Petitioners cited Commander of the Air Force Air Marshal Kapila V.B.Jayampathi, Chief of Staff Air Vice Marshal D.L.S.Dias, Defence Secretary Kapila Waidyarthne and 13 others as Respondents.
Sanjeeva Jayawardena PC instructed by Saranee Gunathilakaa appeared for the Petitioners.
Petitioners state the Command Benevolent Fund was established for the purpose of providing welfare benefits to all ranks of regular and volunteer Air Force which provides Retirement Benefit soon after the retirement for any other reasons.
With the introduction of the Retirement Benefit Scheme, the monthly salary deduction of the members of the Command Benevolent Fund was increased to grant greater retirement benefits and the monthly contribution was increased up to Rs 1750, they state.
Under the scheme, once a member completes the deduction of the 36 instalments, he or she would be entitled to the total retirement benefits based on their category and the period of service, they state.
Accordingly, an Airman who has completed 22 years service and the 36 instalments is entitled to a total retirement benefit of Rs 1,000,000 whereas Air woman who completes 15 years of service and completes the 36 instalments is entitled to a total retirement benefit of Rs 750,000, they state.
Thereafter the Retirement Benefits Scheme under the Command Benevolent Fund has been amended and the retirement benefit has been reduced, they lament.
They complain that if the Fund fails, there has to be a serious negligence on the part of the then Board of Management of the Fund, they contend and that there must have been serious misuse, misappropriation or mismanagement of the Fund. (S.S.Selvanayagam)
