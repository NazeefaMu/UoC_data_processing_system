The Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna today said it will lodged a complaint with the Secretariat for Committee on Eradication of Corruption and the Bribery Commission with regard to the new Rs 80 billion treasury bond scam on Wednesday.
JVP Former MP and Politburo Member Wasantha Samarasinghe told a media briefing that his party will lodge a complaint and call for a quick investigation on the issue.
?We will lodge a complaint with the Secretariat for Committee on Eradication of Corruption and the Bribery Commission as the Central Bank had continued its corrupt deals through the Rs 40 billion bond issue which ended up with Rs 80 billion. ? The bond issue was to raise Rs 40 billion but the Central Bank had ended up raising Rs 80 billion at the end,? Mr Samarasinghe said.
?The Central Bank had continued its corrupt deals through the governor?s son-in-law?s company and we have decided to lodged a complaint against the recent bond issue,? he added.
He said the working class had been directly affected by the bond issue this time.
?The Employee Provident Fund (EPF) is made to purchase bonds from primary dealers at a discount rate of one percent. This means that the interest rate which the EPF secures will be reduced by one percent.,? he said while stating that the EPF will lose Rs 80 million for each Rupees one billion it invests on treasury bonds.

SL will be an economic hub in the Indian Ocean: PM
	
Sri Lanka will be turned into an economic and a monetary centre in the Indian Ocean where the ordinary citizens in the island will be able to engage in transaction in the monetary markets, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said on Saturday.
?Sri Lanka will be turned into an economic and monetary hub in the Indian Ocean where ordinary people could invest in the monetary market,? the Prime Minister told a Sinhala and Tamil New Year celebration in Suduwella, Maradana over the weekend.
?Colombo will be the key centre in our economic development programme and it will be developed together with the Western Province. Sri Lanka will be turned into an economic and monetary hub in the Indian Ocean where ordinary people could invest in the monetary market,? the Prime Minister added.
Also he said the value of lands in Colombo will increase in the future when the government?s economic programme gets under way and goes on
We will improve the value of lands in Colombo and we will facilitate all the people to earn an income.
? Let me give you one advise. Do not sell your lands in a hurry. You will be able to fetch a much better price for your lands in a year or two. If you own lands keep them. When the county develops further many will demand your lands at a good price,? he said.
He said the Sinhala Tamil New Year in 2016 has been celebrated on a high note. ?Everyone seemed to have cash in their hands. Many went shopping and consumed goods to their satisfactory. This means the economy had developed to some extent. Our effort is to further expand this development, he added
? When I see the new year gifts that are in line for distribution today one can see that the economy had developed to some extent. This reminded me in 1977 when giving a bicycle as a first prize in a New Year celebration like this one was a great thing. Only I was able to gift a bicycle at a New Year Celebration then. Later Cyril Mathew distributed some bicycles at a new year celebration when he was the Minister of Industries. Things have changed today as a vast development had taken place since then, he also said. (YP)

SLFP should be restructured- President
	
President Maithripala Sirisena yesterday said the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) should be restructured as a clean political party and that there would be many obstacles during the said restructuring process.
He said a good political party was the foundation of a good government.
Speaking at a SLFP meeting in Amabalangoda, the President said that despite the obstacles he faced as the Chairman of the SLFP, he would take every possible step to strengthen the party.
He said the responsibility of all SLFPers was not to conspire to form a new government, relying on personal agendas, but to join hands with the party, to solve the problems of the people.
?Today, a new government is not what the people need. They need us to solve problems that have become a burden to them. To achieve that, every politician should put his/her personal political agendas aside and give priority to the people,? he said.
Meanwhile, he invited all the SLFP members to attend the ?historic? May Day Rally at the Samanala Grounds in Galle. (PF)

Will seek dual citizenship, separate homeland for SL Tamils: Jayalalithaa
	
AIADMK supremo and Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Jayalalithaa on Saturday asserted her party would take ?continuous steps? to attain a separate homeland for Tamils in Sri Lanka and demand that the Centre grant dual citizenship for refugees from the island nation living in the state, PTI reported.
Addressing a huge election rally, she said she has been continuously demanding an independent, international probe over war crimes and alleged genocide against Tamils in Sri Lanka.
Launching a diatribe against arch rival DMK over the Sri Lankan Tamils issue, she alleged that DMK and Congress were together responsible for the destruction of Sri Lankan Tamils.
Noting that Sri Lankan Tamils have for long been living in and outside camps in Tamil Nadu, she said her regime was giving them all facilities.
She stressed that her party?s policy was that any repatriation should be voluntary and based on the choice of refugees ?after the situation in Sri Lanka, including security aspects changes fully, (for the better)?.
Jayalalithaa accused DMK of staging ?dramas? over the issue against their interests.
She recalled that the Tamil Nadu Assembly had passed several resolutions on the Sri Lankan issue moved by her.
Some of these included her demand for economic sanctions against Sri Lanka, an international probe against ?war crimes? and another related to a referendum (that she wanted to be sponsored by India in the UN forum) among Tamils on the question of a separate Eelam (Tamil homeland).
