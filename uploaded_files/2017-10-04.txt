All religions to enjoy equal rights, Buddhism given foremost place: PM
	
The Prime Minister said today that there should be maximum devolution and all religions to enjoy their equal rights, while Buddhism is treated and given the first and foremost place.
Delivering the keynote address at the opening ceremony of the Association of SAARC Speakers and Parliamentarians today at the Colombo Hilton, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said there is a consensus among all political parties represented in Parliament, participating in the Constitution making process, that this country can?t be divided and should be one, which gives the meaning in Sinhalese as 'ekiya' or oneness.
Mr. Wickremesinghe emphasised that the Constitutional Assembly must decide on how a second chamber should be and how we move towards a system of proportional representation and how the constituencies on the lines of the New Zealand system.
The President Maithripala Sirisena declared open the 8th Conference of the Association of SAARC Speakers and Parliamentarians yesterday at the Colombo Hilton.
Speakers, Deputy Speakers and Parliamentarians from Sri Lanka, India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Maldives, Nepal and Afghanistan are taking part in the three day confab.
Speaking further, Mr. Wickremesinghe said, we hold the 8th SAARC Speakers and the Parliamentarians? Conference in the background of the 70th anniversary of Sri Lanka's parliamentary democracy as an independent country. We mark this year firstly to celebrate this occasion and secondly to commence the drafting of a New Constitution.
At the last presidential election, President Maithripala Sirisena as the common candidate pledged a New Constitution which would strengthen democracy, bring national unity by addressing the issues which were at the heart of the question of ethnic conflict.
?I thought I would explain to you the measures we have taken so far under the present Sri Lanka Constitution by enacting a New Constitution which lies with Parliament and the people at a Referendum. The task we had was how to get all the parties together. Not only the 2/3rd majority, we also had formed the national government and there were diverse views. There were those who came with us as an alliance to back the presidential candidate and then for the parliamentary election and those who came from other parties who had different positions. How do we try to ensure a consensus? The traditional way of constitution drafting has been for Parliament to appoint a Select Committee.
?The Select Committee gives the report - there?s a majority report and a minority report. But we felt that it was not appropriate for Sri Lanka to find a division and you find different reports coming as an official position of parties as official reports. So we have used another mechanism. A modified version of Constituent Assembly.
?The Constituent assembly will enable us to consult the whole country before we reach an agreement. If we cannot reach an agreement then we would have to report so to Parliament. So rather than have a Select Committee, which was just called for evidence and have the divisions of Parliament, we thought, let this Constituent Assembly give a free flow, let the people express their views and then within their Constituent Assembly see how we can narrow and reach a consensus", Mr. Wickremesinghe emphasized.
?This report was also submitted to the steering committee. So by end of January this year we had the 7 reports which was then tabled in Parliament and made available. But we said these are the views of the subcommittee. This is not the views of the steering committee. But we will take it up for debate and discussion when we have the interim report of the steering committee. Then started a long discussion by ourselves. What is devolution, what is the nature of the State, whether we should have a Second Chamber, what should be the electoral system, whether we should have a Constitution Court or a Supreme Court. Each of these were dealt with", Mr. Wickremesinghe added. (Sandun A Jayaskera)

Another head rolls
	
?
So yet another Customs chief has suffered a fall from the hot seat.
?
The ouster did not come to him as a surprise because he had received in advance a coded message from some Ministry high-ups saying, ?You have forfeited the pleasure of the powers that be. Look for another place soon.?
His refusal to bend the rules and regulations to accommodate the demands of some business tycoons with close ties to certain influential political families is the main reason for moving out the white collar one from the coveted office. Meanwhile, he had come in for flak from some trade union sources too, they say.
However, the displaced white collar one has decided to go home rather than assume duties in the new post.?

Basil's comment was politically motivated: SF
	
Field Marshal Minister Sarath Fonseka said today that former minister Basil Rajapaksa?s remark made in Jaffna over ?individuals? within the army committing crimes during and after the war was politically motivated to win the hearts of the Tamils in the North.
During the weekend in Jaffna, Mr. Rajapaksa was quoted as saying that he thinks forces didn?t commit war crimes but individuals might have committed crimes.
Addressing a news briefing held at the Regional Development Ministry, Minister Fonseka said Mr. Basil Rajapaksa had betrayed the entire army to get closer to the Tamil population.
?The minority rejected the Rajapaksas with disgust and this was clearly evident from the election results. To change this, to show affection, he used the army. We too have won the hearts of the Tamils but we used just and fair methods,? he said.
He said there was a difference between the statement he made accusing Army Commander (Rtd) General Jagath Jayasuriya of crimes and the statement made by Mr. Basil Rajapaksa.
The minister said he didn?t accuse the entire army or made accusations without naming anyone.
?I clearly pointed finger at one person and not at random individuals. I received a phone call from a corporal who was with Jagath Jayasuriya. He informed me that Jayasuriya was involved in crimes even two weeks after the end of the war,? he said.
He questioned why the individuals, politicians and monks who readily criticized him for making the previous statement over Jagath Jayasuriya and crimes, are today silent on the statement made by Mr. Rajapaksa.
?Those who pointed finger at me and spoke for the protection of war heroes are silent today. They don?t shed any tears now,? he said.
Responding to concerns that statements made with regard to military personnel and crimes would bring disgrace to Sri Lanka, Minister Fonseka said if anyone had committed crimes they should be punished.
?If anyone knows about perpetrators, they should be brought before justice. The disgrace will only befall on the country if action was not taken against the wrongdoers. If anyone withholds evidence of someone committing crimes, they should be ashamed of themselves,? he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

JO?s Panchaudha received a phone call from a purohita in yahapalanaya the other day. And the conversation that ensued lasted for several minutes.?
?
This purohita, a former provincial chief, was among the few who did much spadework to usher in yahapalanaya. However, he is said to be among the disgruntled few in yahapalanaya these days.
?
By the way, according to some sources privy to what transpired during the phone-chat between Panchaudha and the unhappy purohita, the twosome had discussed a move afoot to bring out a new law to vest the incumbent chief purohitas of the provincial bodies about to be dissolved, with some extraordinary powers pending the election of new councils.
The yahapalanaya purohita had, in fact, rung up Panchaudha to convey this piece of news.?
Now that Panchaudha had obtained all details about the proposed new legislation, he is said to be readying his guns for an all-out war on yahapalanaya on this issue, they say.?

The Colombo Crimes Division (CCD) yesterday sought public assistance over whereabouts of Ven. Arambepola Rathanasara Thera and a former Police Constable, who are wanted for investigations into the Mount Lavinia incident, where a group of Myanmar refugees were allegedly harassed by a group of protesters on September 26.

From Silk Road to Belt and Road
	
Ancient Buddhist heritage in China enlivens Silk Road in modern form
China is featured in the world media over its Belt and Road Initiative, a project primarily associated with international trading in today?s context. Little is known about the fact that the ancient Silk Route that ran across Dunhuang, China served the crosscurrents of people and cultures giving birth to the Buddhist heritage site called Mogao Grottoes.
Located around 25 kilometres off Dunhuang, Mogao caves, which speak volumes about the rich Buddhist heritage of China, evolved due to encounters with the Indus Valley civilizations through the ancient Silk Route.
The UNESCO listed the Mogao Caves as a world heritage site in 1987. Since then, China has placed the site as a high protection site. In fact, even today photography is not allowed inside the caves as flashlights of cameras can damage the historic murals and paintings
Nestled in the middle of the Gobi Desert and carved into the eastern side of Mingsha Mountains, is a long line of caves, whose walls bear numerous Buddhist murals, sculptures and statues.?
The network of caves, commonly called Mogao Grottos, is now a world heritage site declared by the UNESCO.
Last month, China conducted its International Media Forum on the Belt and Road Initiative in Dunhuang, which is home to this Buddhist heritage site. It seems that the heritage site, preserved to be faithful to its original texture of murals and art works, is now used as a powerful tool of culture diplomacy played by China for fostering ties with the rest of the world in the modern context.
Dunhuang is an oasis of the Gobi Desert bordering Inner Mongolia on one side and Tibet on the other. Despite bright sunshine, the cool breeze across the desert terrain, marked by sand dunes and caravans of camels, ensures comfortable tourism for visitors today.
Carved into the mountain cliff, there are 492 caves in the Mogao Grottos housing over 2,000 sculptures and about 45,000 square metres of murals.?
According to travel guides, the Mogao Grottos are divided as the Southern and Northern areas.
The Northern area comprises 243 caves used for religious practices and as living quarters of monks. Like in ancient Sri Lanka, Buddhism, which travelled to China from India along this ancient silk route, enjoyed the maximum possible patronage from the rulers of various Chinese dynasties.?
They appeared to have considered it as their foremost duty to patronize the building of the places and objects of Buddhist worship. Inscriptional evidence suggests, as transpired during briefings by our travel guides, that the first cave of Mogao Grottos was built by monk Le Zun in 366AD. Afterwards, the cave constructions continued for ten dynasties starting from Northern Liang.?
Along with Buddhist work of art, tourists also find paintings of camels pulling carts, vividly describing the mode of trade during the ancient era along the silk route that connected Gansu Province with Central Asia in principle at that time.
Geographically speaking, the Silk Road had been the confluence of two main cultivations at that time.?
Dunhuang had been an intersection along the Road. As such, it offered an avenue not only for trading in goods but also for cross cultural exchanges at that time. It finally influenced the development of a unique Chinese tradition of art with imprints from the rest of the Buddhist world at that time.
The images, depicted in the caves built during the Northern Liang and Northern Wei Period, show the Buddha in Samadhi. The image-making culture has evolved over the following years in terms of techniques adopted for the depiction of Jataka Stories associated with the Buddha?s life.
A major attraction is the 34.5 metre tall Buddha statue. Its construction started during the Tang dynasty in 695 AD. Later, it had been developed further and further during the reigns of other dynasties that followed.?
Last month, China conducted its International Media Forum on the Belt and Road Initiative in Dunhuang, which is home to this Buddhist heritage site. It seems that the heritage site, preserved to be faithful to its original texture of murals and art works, is now used as a powerful tool of culture diplomacy played by China for fostering ties with the rest of the world in the modern context.
It is said that Empress We Zetian took steps in the construction of Dayun Temple in every prefecture. This Cave, housing the image of Maitreya Buddha, is considered to be the ancient Dayun Temple.
Another major attraction is Cave 148. It houses the Buddha in Nirvana posture. It had been built in 776 AD. Illustrations on the walls of this particular cave describe different Suttas including Mahaparinibbhana Sutta.
The UNESCO listed the Mogao Caves as a world heritage site in 1987. Since then, China has placed the site as a high protection site. In fact, even today photography is not allowed inside the caves as flashlights of cameras can damage the historic murals and paintings.?
Not only that, the number of visitors per day is restricted to 6,000 as otherwise their inhalations and exhalations inside the cave chambers could also be harmful to the walls bearing works or art. High-tech sensor devices have been installed to monitor moisture and temperature level constantly for better preservation.
The site has gone through several cycles of damage and restorations.Some parts of paintings have been vandalised probably during times of invasion by those of different faiths.
China selected Dunhuang, the city of Mogao Grottoes, to host over 400 media personnel representing 126 countries and organisations in view of the International Media Forum on the Belt and Road Initiative. That is apparently to put China?s vision in perspective in a historical context.
China has digitised the site. In a state-of-the-art theatre, visitors can watch the filmed versions of ancient murals, paintings and statues on digital screens for greater understanding of history.
Monk Xuanzang inspired Mogao art?Also available are specially designed films showcasing ancient China. Visitors, again, are entertained with scenes describing how Gansu Province or Dunhuang for that matter prevailed at that time both as a trading spot and hotspot of invasions.
There are scenes of caravans of camels, carrying items such as silk, ceramic and tea on the one hand. On the other hand, caravans are found to return with items such as gold and gems from the other side of the world in Central Asia.
Swirling sandstorms and sword-wielding bandits on horseback are menacing. Amidst all that, come Buddhist monks on religious missions on the ancient Silk Route.
Xuanzang is one such Buddhist monk who arrived along the silk route carrying Buddhism to China. So, the ancient silk route not only served the purpose of cross-border trading of items of valuable ceramic, tea, gems and gold, but also spread the message of the Buddha across the Central Asian region to China from India.
Dunhuang is the oasis in which Xuanzang stopped. He translated Buddhist suttas. It inspired the new form of Buddhist art now visible on the walls of Mogao Grottos in the form of Buddha statues in different postures, celestial musicians, and ancient merchants. In history, the site has witnessed periods of abandonment. In 1900, a Taoist monk happened to discovered first cave.??

## Title: Go green  and say ?no? to polythene

Go green  and say ?no? to polythene
	
Polythene is being dumped in both environmentally and socially sensitive sites such as in marshy lands, low-lying areas, public places, by roadsides and in the wild. This unhealthy practice has resulted in adverse conditions including water pollution and air pollution, and sometimes, even deaths (recent Meethotamulla dump collapse).?
Waste collection and disposal play a pivotal role in cleanliness and sustainability, with people?s health and conservation of resources being the responsibility of every government.?
Plastic is some kind of ?superhero? when it comes to making our life better and easier. People do not really care about how plastic affects the environment. Single-serve beverages and snacks in plastic packaging are an easy grab-and-go option. We know the story when we take a look around. And how about plastic shopping bags you get from the store? Buy it free and throw it on the go. Sri? Lanka uses an approximate of 20 million shopping bags and 15 million lunch sheets a day. Wherever you dump those, polythene will stay for more than a thousand years; killing you slowly but surely.
It is sad to say dumping garbage in public areas is a ritual of many Sri Lankans. I still wonder what the authorities and so-called environmental societies are doing to keep this country clean. Putting an environmental quote on a diary or spending millions on an advertisement does nothing good
Do we really care about our environment?
It was rather sad to find some 200 tonnes of garbage outside Dalada Maligawa immediately after the Dalada Perahera. Also it was reported that more than a million plastic bottles were collected from Sri Pada. If we cannot protect these sacred places, how can we protect other places? Even the BMICH premises is often found filled with heaps of garbage. For instance, after the recent international book fair. Is this the mentality of our so-called ?readers???
People of the country??
The government had planned to reduce polythene usage without even introducing an alternative. Hope the government had conducted a feasibility study before implementing such a strategy. Sri Lankans are used to passing the buck when situations don?t favour them, and in the case of garbage disposal, it is the government that it always at fault. The wise presume banning polythene is unnecessary if they are disciplined enough and know how to use it.?
Sometime back, we had a 3R Policy (Reduce, Reuse and Recycle). But now, all developed countries promote Zero-Waste, meaning all waste should be treated as resources for another production processes. But unfortunately we promote ?no reduce, no reuse and no recycle.??
It is sad to say dumping garbage in public areas is a ritual of many Sri Lankans. I still wonder what the authorities and so-called environmental societies are doing to keep this country clean. Putting an environmental quote on a diary or spending millions on an advertisement does nothing good.?
Sri Lanka spends only 0.16% of the GDP on Research and Development -- a very low allocation compared to developed and developing countries. It is not practical to wait till the government comes up with a greater solution than banning. What if we could request both state and private universities to conduct a combined research and arrive at a greener solution for this waste crisis? That is what developed countries do.?
The other negative point is that we wait for the eleventh hour. We procrastinate until the government takes center stage. Lack of right discipline and self-awareness made Sri Lanka a developing country over decades.?
Developed countries and Sri Lanka
Countries like Japan has more serious disciplines in waste management. Japanese are more responsible for their household waste. Disposing trash in public is a social taboo in Japan. Japan has 44 ?waste? categories. Waste segregation is much complicated when comparing to others. But self-awareness made it easy to them. It made Japan an incredibly-clean and eco-friendly country in the world.?
Inventing and investing more on renewable or going green has become a trend. Developed countries create more jobs opportunities in the sector of sustainable development. Some countries have autonomous vehicles to collect garbage, while others automate their system. But what do we do? Our garbage collectors hoot when collecting garbage. Isn?t it primitive in all sense??
Are we going to stay as a 3rd World Country for the rest of our lives? If you think recycling is an impossible and undesirable task, just remember that there is a 7-year-old child in the US who has earned $20,000 in just two years merely by recycling plastic bottles. Wayne Huizenga, well-known American businessman and entrepreneur became a billionaire capitalizing on garbage collection

Wayne Huizenga, well-known American businessman and entrepreneur became a billionaire capitalizing on garbage collection.?
Impact of polythene and plastic?
It is recorded that Sri Lanka is ranked within the world with regard to disposing garbage in the sea. This is a grave concern even if we don?t see the impact. It is found that over a million marine animals die from plastic annually. According to a research done on countries that dump plastic and polythene waste into marine environment by International Business Times, over 13 million tonnes of non-recyclable waste is dumped annually into the sea, 80% of the waste was observed to be polythene and plastic from 20 countries including Sri Lanka. We can?t just let go how these plastics and polythene kill our coral reefs. Unfortunately, no one cares about it until the next Tsunami hits Sri? Lanka. The impact and effectiveness of Sea Protection laws need to be changed. Researchers from the Ghent? University in Belgium found fish prefer to eat plastic over food. More than 50 species of fish are likely to eat plastic debris over their natural food.
Further, the researches predict that every seafood lover could be eating up to 11,000 micro-plastic particles a year. But they are yet to find the impact on our health, but for sure if the plastic levels increase so as the risk. As per the World Economic Forum, there will be more plastic than fish in the sea by 2050. It is surprising to know that plastic particles surface in our own drinking water. Researchers from Orb Media tested samples of pipe-borne water worldwide and found that almost every sample was contaminated with micro-plastics.
As per the study, an average of 80% of tap water is contaminated with plastic fibre. Scientists are yet to establish the impact of these fibers to the human body. However, they did confirm that micro fibres easily absorb toxins than other substances and release it to the body once ingested. So the disaster is very real.?
Supermarkets?
One of the main channels of increasing polythene usage is from supermarket chains. For the sake of drawing more and more customers, supermarket executives separate each and every item with polythene bags. If someone buys 10 items, they would be put in 10 polythene bags. This has to change immediately.?
Supermarkets have introduced thicker polythene (20-micron) bags for carriage considering they would be reused by customers. But unfortunately it has doubled the resin import and hasn?t seen any reduction in waste. I personally believe that people only feel the difference of new polythene bags instead of its use. It is surprising that even supermarket executives have no knowledge on newly-introduced high-density polythene bags.?
It was rather sad to find some 200 tonnes of garbage outside Dalada Maligawa immediately after the Dalada Perahera. Also it was reported that more than a million plastic bottles were collected from Sri Pada
Simple ways to reduce polythene usage at supermarkets?
Educate customers on recycling and reusing by expertise at the outlet itself (like they promote goods), make a discipline - ?Carrying Your Own Bag,? discounting (as a percentage of the final bill value) when customers use their own Non-Polythene (cloth) bags, encourage customers to prefer re-usable grocery bags and to refuse plastic bags, encourage buying in bulk, encourage customers to buy reusable and rechargeable items, reduce issuing number of polythene bags for item separation, reduce polythene/plastic food packaging, increase bottled beverages, educate people on eating processed food (good for health and the environment),? encourage people to make squeezed fresh juice or eat fruits than buying juices in bottles, encourage customers to return reusable containers (plastic bottles, ice-cream cups etc?).??

Govt. begins drafting separate legal framework for Financial City
	
Amid the controversy surrounding the draft new constitution, the government behind closed doors is drafting a new legal framework to administer the China-backed Colombo International Financial City (CIFC), the 500-acre Colombo sea front reclaimed for a special economic zone, Mirror Business learns.
A team of international consultants are said to be already in town sketching the new piece of legislation and the policy framework under which the CIFC would be governed and the blueprint of the draft law could be available within a matter of a year.
The new piece of legislation will follow the English Law, the legal system governing the England and Wales.? ?
Sri Lankan government is believed to have obtained the services of Bob Wigley, the current Chairman of UK Finance ? the apex body representing nearly 300 banking and financial services providers in or from the United Kingdom ? and the former Chairman of Merrill Lynch for Europe, Middle East and Africa, as the lead consultants.?????? ?
Accordingly, the US $ 1.4 billion CIFC, Sri Lanka?s single largest foreign direct investment thus far, will be governed by completely different set of laws, compared to the laws governing the rest of the country, and will have separate courts and arbitration centers.
A top lawyer in Sri Lanka at a recent forum expressed his doubts over placing the CIFC under separate jurisdiction as such a move requires the constitution to be amended, which he said is an arduous process.But now the government is slowly moving ahead with the process of introducing a new constitution, despite massive opposition, which may pave the way for the introduction of a separate legal framework to govern the CIFC.
CIFC, which was earlier known as the Port City was initiated by the Rajapaksa administration.
The current Sirisena-Wickremesinghe regime in the run up to the election in 2015 vowed to scrap the project, which they alleged was a threat to the country?s sovereignty as the original agreement contained clauses pertaining to giving out freehold land in the reclaimed area to the Chinese.
But the duo had to soon give into the pressure from China and had to resume the project. The project was re-named as Colombo International Financial City and the government was able to negotiate a new project contract that did not include giving out freehold land to China.
According to the new project plan, the reclaimed land area will not only house a financial city but also a host of other facilities such as a marina, an international school, a hospital and a central park.
An estimated US $ 13 billion foreign investment is expected from 2018 onwards into the zone.
However, according to people close to the project, some key decision makers have told Prime Minister Wickaremesinghe that there is little use in bringing new legislation unless the special economic zone could not come within the top 20 doing business rankings.
Hence, the new legislation will do away with exchange controls, allow free movement of people, hire expatriates from anywhere by the firms operating within the zone and will also enable hassle-free company incorporation.
CIFC competes with similar regional financial centers in Dubai and Singapore.

2 kg gold recovered from stomach of SL passenger
	
Around 2 kg of gold was recovered from the stomach and rectum of the Sri Lankan passenger who was detained by the Indian customs officials on his arrival at the Visakhapatnam airport.
The Indian Express reported that the doctors of King George Hospital, where the passenger was kept under observation for more than 24 hours, recovered 14 packets of gold weighing around 125 grams each. Another four packets were recovered by the customs officials on the day he was detained at the airport. However, the customs officials claimed that the total recovered gold amounted to 347 grams.
The passenger, identified as Abdul Razak Mohammed Ziyard, boarded the Sri Lankan Airlines flight UL-169 and landed at Visakhapatnam airport on Sunday. Growing suspicious over his ?awkward gait?, the customs officials detained him. He was shifted to KGH for full body scanning and the reports confirmed that he was carrying gold in his stomach and rectum. A team comprising a radiologist, a general surgeon and a physician, recovered the gold packets from the stomach of the passenger through natural excretion method by administering laxatives.
Asked about how the accused managed to carry the gold packets, KGH Superintendent G Arjuna said, ?The passenger seems to be a professional smuggler. He might have cut the gold bars into small pieces of 1 to 1.5 inch each and packed them in black polythene packets neatly stitched with a sliding tape which might have helped him swallow them. The sliding tape also ensured the free movement of the packets through the stomach and rectum.?

The Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) today charged that Minister of Higher Education Lakshman Kiriella has no authority to declare about the concluding dates of cases which were ongoing in courts.
While referring to a media statement claimed to be released by Minister Kiriella asking the State university students to attend to lectures, GMOA Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge told a news conference that in the same statement, the minister had assured that the case filed at the Supreme Court on SAITM would be concluded within one and half months.
?The Minister has earlier revealed several facts in Parliament about the verdict of the case filed in the Court of Appeal on the same issue. The Minister has used parliamentary privileges to avoid our claims at that time,? he added.
He said that this remark could be regarded as interference to the judicial proceeding by the Minister and added that it was evident that there was another political and economical agenda going on with regard to this SAITM issue.
Meanwhile, he said that the student enrolments to SAITM should be suspended immediately as the initial step of solving this issue. He also said it was mandatory to make a legal framework to it and added that a gazette should be issued on the suspension of the student admission at the SAITM.
He said that parents of the State university students were ready to go for a fast unto death if the government would not provide their children with a reasonable solution to the issue. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)

NP Chief Minister rejects steering committee report
	
The Tamil People?s Council chaired by NP Chief Minister C.V. Wigneshwaran had issued a press notice informing that they are rejecting the report of the subcommittee of the steering committee appointed for drafting the New Constitution.
The press notice states that the proposed New Constitution has been prepared with much alignment towards Sinhala Buddhist opinion, and the government should clearly indicate its position in solving the problems faced by the Tamil People and include such decisions in the proposed Constitution.
The interim report had shown that all are considered as Sri Lankans, but it has failed to recognize the rights of the Tamil people.
Therefore, the New Constitution should consider the Tamil Nationals as a separate unit and formulate the changes accordingly. Finding a solution only through the sovereignty of the Tamil Nationals would usher in peace and in drafting a New Constitution they are expecting the intervention of the International community as well, the news notice further states.

Police search for gunman?s motive
	
?
Police sought clues on Tuesday to explain why a retiree with a penchant for gambling but no criminal record set up a sniper?s nest in a high-rise Las Vegas hotel and poured gunfire onto a concert below, slaying dozens of people before killing himself.??
The Sunday night shooting spree from a 32nd-floor window of the Mandalay Bay hotel, on the Las Vegas Strip, killed at least 59 people before the gunman turned a weapon on himself. More than 500 were injured, some trampled, in the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history.??
The gunman, identified as Stephen Paddock, 64, left no immediate hint of his motive for the arsenal of high-powered weaponry he amassed, including 34 guns, or the carnage he inflicted on a crowd of 22,000 attending an outdoor country music festival.??
Paddock was not known to have served in the military, or to have suffered from a history of mental illness or to have registered any inkling of social disaffection, political discontent or radical views on social media.??
U.S. officials also discounted a claim of responsibility by the militant Islamic State group.??
?We have determined to this point no connection with an international terrorist group,? Aaron Rouse, special agent in charge of the Federal Bureau of Investigation field office in Las Vegas, told reporters on Monday.??
Police said they believed Paddock acted alone but were at a loss to explain what might have precipitated it.??
?We have no idea what his belief system was,? Clark County Sheriff Joseph Lombardo told reporters. ?I can?t get into the mind of a psychopath.???
Although police said they had no other suspects, Lombardo said investigators wanted to talk with Paddock?s girlfriend and live-in companion, Marilou Danley, who he said was traveling abroad, possibly in Tokyo.??
Lombardo also said detectives were ?aware of other individuals? who were involved in the sale of weapons Paddock acquired.?

## Title: PTL?s files referring to ?AM? and ?RK? feature in Aloysius? text messages
## Section: Breaking News
## Date: 4 October 2017 08:39 am
PTL?s files referring to ?AM? and ?RK? feature in Aloysius? text messages
	
Several text messages extracted from PTL owner Arjun Aloysius? phone, referring to files maintained at PTL titled as ?to do list to AM and RK? were submitted before the Presidential Commission of Inquiry (PCoI) yesterday by Additional Solicitor General Dappula De Livera who continued to cross examine former Central Bank Governor Arjuna Mahendran.
Continuing the cross-examination of former CBSL Governor Arjuna Mahendran, Additional Solicitor General Dappula de Livera yesterday questioned the witness over the relationship he had with his son-in-law?s company (Perpetual Treasuries Ltd) after he resigned from the post of Governor at CBSL on June 30, 2016.
ASG Dappula de Livera: Did you get involve in PTL affairs after you stepped down from the post of Governor?
Witness: No. But on one occasion in November 2016 they spoke with me and said that PTL had been curtailed by the CBSL from engaging in business activities. But at that time I told them that I don?t have any control as the Governor now.
ASG: Did Aloysius discuss with you?
W: Yes
ASG: And you advised him?
W: No I only listened to what he said. And I told to consult his lawyer regarding the matter. That was the only occasion.
ASG: Are you 100% certain about that?
W: Yes
ASG: After you stepped down, did you have anything to do with the Finance Ministry?
W: No
ASG: Did you visit the Finance Ministry after June 2016?
W: Yes
ASG: Why?
Witness said that he had the right to continue dealing with the Finance Ministry as it was a relevant entity with regard to his professional field.
ASG De Livera thereafter questioned whether he knows about the person called ?Steve Samuel?, who was the personal assistance of the witness? son-in-law, Arjun Aloysius.
ASG: Was Steve Samuel known to you?
W: No
ASG: Have you seen him?
W: No
ASG: Steve Samuel used to communicate matters pertaining to Aloysius? daily schedule to him, would you know that?
W: No. But I take your word.
At this moment ASG De Livera strived to question the witness based on a document, which reflected some extractions of data from Arjun Aloysius? mobile phone. These data were relating to several incoming text messages received by Aloysius from his personal assistant, Steve Samuel.
However, there was confusion after President?s Counsel Anuja Premaratne who was appearing on behalf of Aloysius sought full details of extracted data by the experts.
After a long heated argument, in which all counsel and the Commissioners were involved, it was explained that the entirety of the data extracted from Aloysius? phone (8600 pages) had been given to the Commission?s secretary in a storage form of CDs which were available to the counsel.
When he was questioned by the Commission, ASG Yasantha Kodagoda explained that the data relating to the Aloysius and Samual (text messages) were found from that extraction (8600 pages).
After some confusion, ASG De Livera questioned Mr. Mahendran showing a document contained several pages over the content of the incoming text messages received by Aloysius from his personal assistant.
ASG: Are you aware that your son-in-law Aloysius was maintaining a file titled with ?Things to do list to AM? at Perpetual Treasuries Ltd?
W: No.
ASG: There are certain text messages between Steve Samual and Aloysius which reflect the existence of such a file?
W: I?m not aware of it.
When questioned about the reference of AM, witness Mahendran said that he had never heard people call him AM.
At this point Justice Prasanna Jayawardena asked ASG De Livera whether Mahendran was the correct person to answer what was reflected in the text messages.
In reply ASG De Livera said: ?The problem is that the Commission deprived itself by giving an order on Aloysius? testimony?
?We have crossed that bridge. We gave the order on the basis of the rule of law?, Justice Jayawardena? said.
?We do not agree with that order?, ASG De Livera said.
?That is a different matter, you have not challenged it in a different forum so far,? Justice Jayawardena said.
?Time will tell that?, the ASG answered.
President?s Counsel Romesh de Silva who was appearing on behalf of Mahendran at this moment expressed the view that since his client said he did not know about the text messages, he cannot be further questioned on the content of those text messages.
However, the ASG said that there were references to Mr. Mahendran?s name in these text messages.
The Commission then said to continue with the questioning.
1st Text message- Date: November 22, 2016,
Steve Samuel to Aloysius
??We also have A Mahendran?s ?to do list??.?
ASG: This ?A Mahendran? was referred to you, right?
W: That could be my son, or daughter and ?A Mahendran? could be anyone, there are various people.
ASG: I suggest to you that it refers to you, wasn?t it?
W: I don?t think
2nd Text message ? Date: same day November 22, 2016
Steve Samuel to Aloysius
??Chairman waiting to update Arjun M and RK?.?
When the witness was questioned about the content of the text message, he said that he did not know about it but it could be relating to the matter that PTL discussed with him over the curtailment of business activities by the CBSL.
ASG: Do you know about whom ?RK? refers to?
W: No
ASG: Was that Ravi Karunanayake?
W: I have not heard of him being called RK. I have only heard people call him Ravi K.
ASG: But Mr. Ravi Karunanayake rejected that stance on him being known as Ravi K when he was testifying before the Commission. Thank you for bringing that up.
3rd Text message- Date: between November 2016 and January 2017
Samuel to Aloysius
??..I?m going to Flower Road to deliver both RK?s and AM?s files?.?
ASG: Do you know about this file?
W: I did not know any files
The witness at this point said that he was not confident about the accuracy of the data extracted from the phone. The ASG however said that he would prove the accuracy of the extraction in due cause with the experts evidence who extracted the data.
The witness replying said: ?This could be a fiction?. (Counsel laughed)
4th text message- Date: January 3, 2017
Samuel to Aloysius
Reminder form text message:10 p.m. with RKA new ?to do list? file
??.AM ?to do list file will be sent home?..Asela brought it to me?.do you want me to bring to Flower road?.?
When the witness was questioned whether ?AM? referred to him, he said that ?AM? could be even his daughter ?Anjali Mahendran?.
ASG De Livera asked the witness whether he was aware that a file had been maintained for him at PTL.
The witness said that he did not know.
Citing the content of an incoming call, ASG De Livera explained that Samuel in this call tells Aloysius that he saw Arjun Mahendran while he was returning from some place.
However, the witness rejected this stance and said that he did not know Steve Samuel even though he would have seen him.
5th Text message- Date between November 2016 and January 2017
Reminder:
* Meeting with AM and Lasantha
ASG: Do you know Lasantha?
W: No
ASG: Do you know Lasantha Somaratne?
W: Name is familiar
ASG: He was the financial advisor of Ravi Karunanayake?s Ministry at that time. And this text message reflects about a meeting at Flower road residence, right?
W: Don?t know
ASG: Point is who is AM?
W: I don?t think that it was me
At this point, when witness said that AM could be even his daughter; the ASG questioned the employment of his daughter. It was revealed that Mahendran?s daughter was an employee of a company in Singapore.
ASG: Why would she be dealing with some Somaratne in the Finance Ministry? It sounds absurd. You are lying through your big teeth.
At this point Justice Jayawardena adding some amusement to the query said: ?Mahendran?s son-in-law (Aloysius) could be a friend of Angelo Mathews (AM)?
The court room burst out in laughter at this comment.
ASG: You had dealt with PTL within the period of your tenure as the Governor and even after, right?
Witness was of the view that he did not deal with PTL in that manner and the extraction was made in an unprofessional manner by the experts because the text messages shown by the ASG were not in order.
ASG De Livera thereafter questioned the witness on the content of the two deleted phone conversations which were earlier played before the Commission while PTL CEO Kasun Palisena was testifying.
These conversations reflected earlier that Aloysius were instructing his CEO Palisena regarding particular information on the March 29, 2016 auction.
ASG De Livera was of the view that this auction was also a similar one to the February 27 , 2015 auction. The ASG questioned the witness whether he could imply that Aloysius was giving price sensitive information to his CEO.
However, the witness said that he is unable to appreciate the quality of the information reflected in those conversations and therefore cannot comment on that because he does not have enough material to say so.
At this point Justice Prasanna Jayawardena questioned the witness.
Justice Jayawardena: Despite the accuracy or inaccuracy of the information would you consider that a primary dealer obtaining information relating to state banks? bidding rate was price sensitive information?
W: Yes
Justice Jayawardena: Would you consider that a primary dealer having the information with regard to the EPF?s bidding amount was price sensitive?
W: Yes
J: Would you consider that a primary dealer having information of a rate cut was price sensitive?
W: Yes
ASG: Aloysius was referring to a department in that conversation, would not it be a department at CBSL?
W: It appears so
ASG: could the Department he referred was PDD (Public Debt Department)
W: That I cannot say
ASG: Aloysius referred to persons in powerful places, do you know who they were?
W: Can?t recall that. I don?t know.
The witness said that those phone conversations were weird conversations to him.
ASG: Aloysius was receiving price sensitive information regarding March 29, 2016 auction, right?
W: I can?t confirm or deny
ASG: Thereby Aloysius manipulated the Market, right?
W: I can?t confirm or deny
ASG De Livera then questioned the witness about the 5 percent penal rate removal on February 27, 2015.
Based on the sudden market influences on the exchange rate of the country, Mahendran said that he had decided to remove the penal rate on February 27, 2015 after discussing about it with Deputy Governor Mr. Weerasinghe and the members of the Market Operation Committee (MOC). This decision was questioned during the cross-examination.
Justice Jayawardena: Was it correct to say that on February 23, 2015, the Monetary Board decided not to change that rate until the next Monetary Board gathering?
W: Yes
J: And there was an instant need to remove the penal rate, right?
W: Yes
J: Would it be proper not to talk about it with the Monetary Board before taking such decision?
W: Yes but this had to be taken very quickly.
J: Do you agree that this rate removal directly affected the profitability of the auction?
W: Yes
During the cross-examination, when the document marked ?AM 22? (the undated letter given to Mahnedran by Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayke) was referred to, ASG De Livera in a sarcastic manner told the witness that AM referred to him. He said that even the document ?AM 22? was named in the proceedings to refer to Arjun Mahendran.
However, the witness said that it was the first time in these proceedings that he was called ?AM.?
The ASG quipped ?That is how liars get caught?
Counsel Chanaka de Silva who was appearing for Mahendran in a lighter vein said ?AM is a.m. and PM is p.m.?
Adding to the amusement Justice Jayawardena cracked: ?Your thoughts get the poor Commission stuck at noon?
During the cross-examination, when Justice Jayawardena questioned, the witness said that huge losses had occurred at the CBSL in 2014 and 2013 prior to his appointment as the Governor. He explained three reasons as to why such losses were incurred by CBSL.
Decision to sell and repurchase the gold in expectation of meeting profits, holding unto Australian dollars and guaranteeing three banks the foreign exchange guarantee had caused these losses, he said.
Meanwhile, when ASG De Livera was questioning the witness on the transfers that were said to have taken place on February 9, 2015 at the CBSL after the new appointment of Mahendran as the Governor, the ASG repeatedly went on to say that Mr. Mahendran was a liar.
ASG: You are not a great liar Mahendran
Justice Jayawardena: That is for us to decide.
Counsel De Silva: It was a cheap allegation.
The Presidential Commission of Inquiry (PCoI) comprising Justice K.T. Chitrasiri (Chairman), Justice Prsanna Jayawardena and retired Deputy Auditor General Velupillai Kandasamy, will meet again at 10 am today.
W: No.
ASG: There are certain text messages between Steve Samual and Aloysius which reflect the existence of such a file?
W: I?m not aware of it.

Putin calls for better US ties as he meets new envoy
	
?
MOSCOW AFP Oct3, 2017-Russian President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday called for ?predictable and mutually beneficial? ties with the United States as he received diplomatic credentials from Washington?s new ambassador to Moscow.??
The US Senate last week confirmed businessman, veteran diplomat and former presidential candidate Jon Huntsman as ambassador to Russia, filling a crucial post at a time when ties are at dangerously low ebb.??
??As far as bilateral ties with the United States are concerned, their current level cannot be satisfying,? Putin said at the Kremlin after he received diplomatic credentials from Huntsman.??
??We are in favour of constructive, predicable and mutually beneficial cooperation. We are convinced it should be based on the meticulous adherence to the principles of equality, respect of national interests and non-interference in domestic affairs.? Putin again expressed condolences to the American people following the Las Vegas shooting which killed at least 59 people and wounded more than 500.??
- ?Problems of reciprocity? - Putin?s spokesman Dmitry Peskov said earlier Tuesday that the Russian president wanted to restore ties with US but stressed he could not do it alone.??

Rajapaksa: The Sinhala Selfie A Different perspective of politics
	
Writer says ?wanted to find out how it is possible for a person to remain that popular even after electoral defeat??
If you want to look at the world of politics in a totally different perspective, Rajapaksa the Sinhala Selfie, and ?83 Daruwo, will help you in your quest.
The launching of the book Rajapaksa: The Sinhala Selfie was held on September 12, at the Sri Lanka Foundation Institute (SLFI) with the participation of key figures in journalism and former Chief Justice C.V Wigneswaran. Chief Minister of the Northern Provincial Council C.V. Wigneswaran was the Chief Guest.
Kusal Perera, a veteran journalist and columnist, who contributes to both the Sinhalese and English newspapers, explained how he was inspired to write the book, what he calls a ?personal narrative?.?
There is no space for critical thinking in today?s society, where emotion driven media decides what reality should be like -Krishan
The foremost amongst the reasons, according to Kusal, is the formidable Political will and character of the former President, who still remains a formidable personality with a considerable influence over the actions of the incumbent Government.?
?I wanted to find out how it is possible for a person to remain that popular even after electoral defeat,? Kusal said.?
He stated that he first started writing the book a month or two after the conclusion of the war. He resumed writing after the Presidential Election in 2010, stopped writing again, finally resolving to finish it in 2015 January, with the electoral results, because, to quote Kusal ?This is a man that can bounce back!?
However, Kusal says that the book is not all or only about Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa.
The book goes 40-50 years back in Sri Lankan political history, all the while trying to untangle hidden layers, which are intertwined.
Talking about the book, Justice Wigneswaran explained his understanding of the title of the book in his speech.?
?A selfie is one?s own photograph. When Mahinda Rajapaksa takes one he sees not Rajapaksa but a representational Sinhala persona.?
He also reminisced about his experiences with the former President, and about requests he had made as the Chief Minister in his official capacity.
?I believe none of the ten requests made by me were fulfilled even though he studiously undertook to look into them favourably. Such is the Sinhala Selfie,? he said.
?It is a timely publication. Though the book is titled Mahinda the Sinhala Selfie, it is full of historical facts of the recent past, which traces the steps that led to the armed rebellion,? he said.
Krishan Siriwardhana, the Editor of the ?83 Daruwo (Children of ?83), and a guest lecturer of the University of Colombo, in his speech about ?83 Daruwo said that today?s society was a post-truth society, where the line between reality and fiction is blurred. ?There is no space for critical thinking in today?s society, where emotion-driven media decides what reality should be like,? he stated.?
Talking about the contents of the book, he explained that it contained a collection of stories covering a variety of socio-political topics.?
?The book explains how, even though to the children born after 1983 the world has turned into a global village due to social media and internet, they are shareholders in spreading racism and separation,? he noted.
Talking about the role that social media plays in promoting discrimination in society he added:
?I recently saw a Facebook Page tilted Embilipitiye Api. Today?s social media, instead of breaking boundaries, creates more boundaries inside the ones that are already there, further dividing society into smaller and smaller groups.?
Today?s society was a post-truth society, where the line between reality and fiction is blurred?
?By reading this book, you do not have to agree with everything that Kusal is saying. But in it, we are presented with the view of a man who does not discriminate against race or ethnicity,? Krishan said.??

Seized cocaine to be publicly destroyed by year-end
	
Nearly 930 kilograms of cocaine seized in Sri Lanka will be destroyed in public this month, Special Task Force (STF) Commandant Senior DIG M.R. Lateef said yesterday.
He said President Maithripala Sirisena had directed that they be destroyed and would be done so in public on the instructions of the Attorney General.
The DIG said another stock of cocaine weighing more than 1,200 kilos, which were held as court productions would also be destroyed on or before December this year.
He said it was a common practice to store the seized narcotic drugs until court proceedings were completed. ?The government analyst has removed samples from the 1,200 kilos of cocaine and we will destroy them publicly based on a court order,? the DIG said.
According to the Police Narcotic Bureau 1,486 kilograms cocaine were seized last year and six Sri Lankans and 13 foreigners arrested in this connection.
The largest detection of narcotics last year was that of the 301 kg seized in July and the 928 kg seized in December. (Darshana Sanjeewa)

Support of all parties necessary to enact New Constitution: President
	
President Maithripala Sirisena said yesterday that the support of all parties is necessary to enact a new Constitution which ensures a Unitary State and strengthens Parliament.
President Sirisena made this remark after opening the special session of the House held to mark 70 years of Parliamentary democracy in Sri Lanka last afternoon.
"Our aim is to strengthen Parliament while ensuring the unitary status of the country and the support of every MP belonging to all political parties is essential to fulfil it" the President said.
"Let's strive towards fulfilling our responsibility of building a secured future for those who will be born tomorrow" he added.
He recalled that Parliament was weakened by the 1978 Constitution and it was further weakened by the 18 Amendments to the Constitution. The President recalled that the present government was able to strengthen the legislature by the 19th Amendment to the Constitution. "We were able to increase powers of Parliament by repealing the 18th Amendment with the mandate of the people given to us on January 8, 2015" the President said in this regard.
The President added that leaders of the past including late Prime Ministers D.S. Senanayaje, S.W.R.D. Bandanaike, Dudley Senanayake, J.R. Jayawardene, R. Premadasa and former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga, late D.B. Wijetunga and former President Mahinda Rajapaksa who all served the nation for the last 70 years should be remembered when celebrating the glorious history of parliamentary democracy in the country.
Mr Sirisena who welcomed the speakers of SAARC region who had come to celebrate with Sri Lanka called for a joint effort of all south Asian countries to achieve economic development and ensuring political ties. " Let's strive towards turning our respective nations into fortunate and quality states " he said. (Yohan Perera and Ajith Siriwardana)

The white collar one at the apex of public administration got a stint at Welikada for the sin of having carried out an illegal order given by his political boss.?
?
Following the historic court ruling, most white collar high-ups in the civil service have now begun working to the letter and the spirit of the law causing much chagrin to the corrupt political bigwigs who have had their say and way so far.??
Meanwhile, a story how a yahapalanaya purohita had to lose face when his secretarial one refused to carry out a verbal directive issued by his political boss is being told and retold with much relish by government sector employees these days.?
According to this story, a certain purohita handling a politics-oriented digital project of the government had directed his secretarial one to carry out a special job which clearly went against the book.?
The secretarial one who patiently listened to the instructions given by his political boss had told him: ?Given the current situation, we have to think twice before carrying out directives given verbally.? I hope, Sir, that you will not misunderstand me. Give me your directive in writing. I?ll see that it is carried out without any delay.?
?Ah! I see! I will give you the necessary instructions in writing,? the purohita had promised.
However, the purohita had neither given written instructions nor had he talked about the matter again!

Soon after accepting a request to join a Cricket Advisory Committee formed by the Minister of Sports, former Sri Lanka skipper Mahela Jayawardena said this would be his last attempt to help transform the game. Jayawardena is part of the six-member committee headed by Hemaka Amarasuriya to make sweeping changes to the way Sri Lanka Cricket is administered and the game is managed.
This committee also comprises three former national captains--Anura Tennakoon, Aravinda de Silva and Kumar Sangakkara-- the Director General of the Sports Medicine Unit Dr. Lakshman Edirisinghe and Ruwan Keragala (Secretary). A few years back Mahela Jayawardena prepared a blueprint on lifting the standard of domestic cricket but this was left to collect dust.
?I wasted a good one year last time making recommendations. I sincerely hope whatever we proposed will be implemented for the good of the game,? Jayawardena said. ?This is my last attempt and if I see things are not moving the way we expect, I will definitely quit.

vanuatu, (Daily Mail), 3 October 2017 - The mass evacuation of a volcano-threatened Vanuatu island is running ahead of schedule as a ramshackle armada of civilian boats ferries people to safety, officials said Monday.??
The entire 11,000 population of Ambae, in the north of the Pacific archipelago, has been ordered to leave after the Manaro Voui volcano rumbled to life and rained rock and ash on villages last week.??
The evacuation to nearby islands was scheduled for completion by this Friday but the Red Cross said it was likely to wrap up on Wednesday.??
It said villagers were exiting the island on a range of locally-commissioned boats - from barges carrying hundreds of people to smaller ferries shipping dozens at a time.?

Two dogs at the same bone?
	
?
The former strongman was taking his lunch at the council canteen last week. There were only a few council members in the canteen at this time. In fact, the former strongman was alone at the table.?
?
On seeing the former boss taking his lunch, a purohita in yahapalanaya headed in that direction. A typical turncoat, who had switched from one party to another from time to time, this worthy, hailing from a legal family, has now hitched his political wagon to the Maitri star.?
In fact, he served as a deputy in the previous regime too. And on the eve of the last big poll, he broke ties with the former strongman to become one of his vociferous critics.?
True to the adage that there are no permanent friends or foes in politics, the purohita cordially greeted his onetime boss and chatted to him for several minutes. However, finding that the former boss was not the keen listener he expected him to be, the purohita soon took leave of him.?
A certain politico who was watching the scene all the time walked up to the former strongman, the moment the purohita walked away. This second visitor was none other than the King Rooster from the plantations-covered uplands.
?I saw that legal one making it up with you, Sir.? You may remember that he did to you what he had already done to me!? King Rooster told him.
?Why do you say so??
?Why, Sir, you may remember that he started his political career from my party!?
?Yes! Yes!?
?He next threw in his lot with you? Now that the boat he is aboard is rocking ? I hear he has now fallen from the grace of high-ups too - he must have thought it was high time he mended his fences, Sir!? King Rooster made his point.?
The former strongman broke into loud laughter.

Once seated opposite the political advisor, the young man, a gabby one, began talking in and out of turn throwing discretion to the winds.?
The advisor gave an attentive ear to the young man without interrupting his long-winded tale.
Finally, he told the advisor: ?I am not afraid of this case, Sir.? I am prepared to face it??
The advisor made no comment.
He opened up again: ?I am going to give forthright answers to all questions from the witness box!?
The advisor made no response.?
The young man continued: ?I don?t care what other people say. I am going to step down from the witness box like a king after a conquest!???

We have failed to come together as Sri Lankans: PM
	
It is regrettable to note that Sri Lankan people who have enjoyed 70 years of Parliamentary democracy and 60 years of independence had failed to come together as Sri Lankans, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said yesterday.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe who was speaking during the special session of the House held yesterday to mark 70 years of parliamentary democracy in Sri Lanka said Sri Lankan people had failed to establish a true Sri Lankan identity by establishing goodwill among all ethnic groups together.
"The failure to establish a true Sri Lankan identity did not allow Sri Lanka to reap maximum benefit of the open economy introduced in 1978" the Prime Minister said while highlighting that this failure took the nation towards an ethnic conflict which lasted for six decades and a war that lasted for thirty years.
" It is indeed regrettable that we have failed to come up with a political solution to the national issue " he added.
However, Mr. Wickremesinghe recalled that Sri Lanka has achieved much using it's 116 years of legislative system". The Legislative system in Sri Lanka was first introduced in 1832. The Governor appointed members for it initially, while the members were elected by the people later. "We were able to use this system to establish two Republican Constitutions using the legislative system and 70 years of parliamentary system. Later, we were able to give more power to Parliament by establishing oversight committees, " he also said.
He stressed that the nation should be thankful to late Prime Ministers D. S. Senanayake, S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike, John Kotelawala, leaders such as G. G. Ponnambalam and N. M. Perera who strived to safeguard parliamentary democracy. (Yohan Perera and Ajith Siriwardana)

The most conspicuous among those in a race to strike a last minute bargain was the ?tie-coat? one from Mannar area commanding a following of five to six Diyawanna members, they say.
It was the doctor hated by some doctors who saved the situation at the eleventh hour, they say.
The controversial doctor had done much coaxing, cajoling and even threatening to win over some bargaining ones.
?Finally, all bargain hunters had agreed to vote for the amendment, but on their own terms, they say.
