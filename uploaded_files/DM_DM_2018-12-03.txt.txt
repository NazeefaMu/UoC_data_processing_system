China-US suspend new tariffs
	

By  David J. Lynch (c) 2018,
BUENOS AIRES, Argentina - President Donald Trump took his first step back in his months-long confrontation with China on Saturday, agreeing to cancel a planned Jan. 1 tariff increase on Chinese products in return for purchases of what the White House called a very substantial amount of American farm, energy andindustrial goods.
The limited bargain, reached with Chinese President Xi Jinping over dinner, will see the U.S. and China restart talks aimed at resolving a trade dispute that is damaging the global economy, worrying some of Trumps Republican allies, and unnerving investors. But the partial accord recalled previous deals that administration officials have disparaged as unenforceable and unproductive.
The two leaders struck the agreement during a roughly 2.5-hour dinner on the sidelines of the summit of G-20 leaders, personally tackling several of the greatest irritants in the U.S.-China relationship.
Trump and Xi agreed to immediately begin talks on Chinese industrial policies, including coercive licensing of U.S. technology, trade secret theft and non-tarifftrade barriers.

This was an amazing and productive meeting with unlimited possibilities for both the United States and China, Trump said in a statement issued from Air Force One as he returned to Washington. It is my great honor to be working with President Xi.
Even as Trump appeared to soften his approach to China, he told reporters that he would formally terminate the 24-year-old North American Free Trade Agreement in a political gamble designed to force wavering lawmakers to back his replacement treaty dubbed the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or USMCA.

Climate talks begin in Polish coal city Katowice
	

REUTERS, 02nd DECEMBER, 2018- Delegates from nearly 200 nations on Sunday began two weeks of talks to tackle deep political divisions at the most important U.N. meeting on global warming since the landmark 2015 Paris deal to shift away from fossil fuels.
Expectations are low that negotiations in Katowice, at the heart of Polands coal region, will be sufficient to address concerns laid out in reports over recent weeks on the severity of rising greenhouse gas emissions.
The political climate has also been transformed since the Paris agreement and the fragile global unity that brought about that accord has shattered. Fijian Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama declared the U.N. conference open on Sunday and handed over the presidency of the talks to Michal Kurtyka, Polands deputy environment minister.

Court cant rely on draft documents: Respondent's Counsel
	
President's Counsel Kushan de Alwis, Ali Sabri and Romesh de Silva -- appearing for the respondents in the Quo Warranto writ petition filed by 122 MPs questioning the legitimacy of Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa and his government to hold office -- said the applications should be dismissed on the basis that the Hanzard produced as a supporting document was not a final thus not admissible in Court.
Kushan de Alwis PC said the petitioners had sought relief based on a document which can be corrected even tomorrow, because of a two-week time limit for the parliament proceedings as published in the Hanzard to be corrected if necessary.
He said the applications were filed in Court on November 23 based on the Hanzard prepared on the proceedings that took place in Parliament on November 14 and as such there was a question on the finality of the Hanzard, because as at that date it was an uncorrected document.
Counsel said the Hanzard on which the petitioners based their applications could not be admissible or entertained in Court because the Court could not rely on draft documents, which are yet to be finalised.
He said the burden of proof on whether the documents were final was the responsibility of the petitioners and that an application based on a draft document was sufficient enough to be dismissed.
President's Counsel Romesh de Silva said it was a misrepresentation of material facts by the petitioners because they had not informed Court that the Hanzard that they had relied upon was an uncorrected version.
President's Counsel Ali Sabri said the petitioners, in their application, despite challenging the appointment of the respondent as prime minister by the President in the first place, they are seeking relief only on the matters which took place on November 14 and onwards.
He said the manner in which the parliamentary proceedings took place on November 14 was nothing but a sham because the manner in which the motion to suspend the Standing Orders was decided and the no-confidence motion was voted on through a division of Ayes and Noes' contradicted the parliamentary SOs.
Associating with the President's Counsel Gamini Marapana's earlier argument, Ali Sabri PC was of the view that the proclamation issued by the president on November 9, 2018 to dissolve parliament will stand dissolved despite the interim order given by the Supreme Court was not the final determination of the Court because when something is dissolved it cannot be suspended, and the interim order is prospectively effected, therefore the decision of dissolution stands and as such Parliament could not have even met on November 14.
Responding to the arguments by the counsel for the respondents, President's Counsel K. Kanag-Iswaran said the parliamentary proceedings were admissible as evidence under the law and not impeachable by Court.
He said the question here was about the respondent (Mahinda Rajapaksa) holding on to illegal power, as Prime Minister the concern should be on the illegality, because under the Article 48 when there is a no-confidence motion passed, the Cabinet stands dissolved.
Kanag-Iswaran PC said there could not be any dispute on the matter of the no-confidence motion because 122 parliamentarians had filed this petition.
Considering the submissions, the Bench comprising Judge Preethi Padman Surasena (President of the Court of Appeal) and Judge Arjun Obeysekara observed the possibility of delivering a preliminary order on the petitions by 3.00 p.m. if the Bench was in a position to prepare a comprehensive judgement by that time.

Dual power-set, locomotive added to railway service: Minister
	
Speaking to the media at the ceremony to add the new trains to the service, the minister said ten locomotives and two dual power-sets had been ordered from India.
"This is the first stock of the order that arrived at the Colombo Port. Each engine costs Rs.77.8 billion and the cost of each dual power-set is Rs.1.8 billion. No improvements have been made to the railway service for the last five years. The new locomotive and power-set will be put into use after testing it on local tracks. Each dual power-set consists of nine compartments including five third-classes, two second-classes and two air-conditioned, he said.
The minister requested the commuters to protect the compartment and proposed to impose severe punishment on those who damage the public property. Severe punishments similar to Saudi Arabia should be imposed. However, the ministry has taken measures to add nine more dual-power sets and five engines to the railway service by next year, he said.
On a different note, the minister said steps were being taken to reduce the number of heavy vehicles such as container lorries on the road.
We should use the train service to transport containers to minimise traffic snarls. 20 train fuel carriages and 20 freight carriages will be added to the train transport service by next year. We can develop the train service but people should also be responsible for the protection of the public property, he said. (Chaturanga Samarawickrama)

## Title: Four ways to motivate yourself at work

Four ways to motivate yourself at work
	
A recent study covering 182 countries by the International Research Firm Gallup indicates that only 13% of employees feel actually engaged at their work places worldwide.
This startling figure reveals that most employees dont feel that their organizations fully engage with them. They do not feel psychologically safe or positively motivated to fully contribute to work.
This can be a common problem in todays offices harming work place morale and career progression.
So lets take a look at a few ways on how we can keep ourselves continuously motivated at office and positively contribute to our jobs:
Power of Goals
Goals have a powerful way of keeping us emotionally engaged with work and more focused. Knowing your True North and where you are headed in life, and then aligning that path to your job role is an easy way to link your personal goals and career goals together.
The experts talk about two broad types of goals  Proximal Goals and Distal Goals.
Proximal Goals are the short term goals you set to be achieved in near future and Distal Goals are the long term goals you plan out for your life.
As you achieve your daily proximal goals with the right Daily Habits, you will get a certain level of confidence and inspiration to keep going towards your longer term objectives in life. Goals must also cover the various spheres in your life; spiritual goals, health goals, relationship goals, careers goals  if they are to truly make a difference and keep you motivated. Constant and timely review of both your short term and long term goals will ensure you prioritize the right areas in your life, so that you do not go off course and are always on the right track to success.
Be a Learner
In this ever-more competitive corporate world, staying on top of your industry and learning about your respective field has never been more essential. We are at an age where young millennials and freshers are entering the job market either full or part qualified, and taking up various job roles which previously went to experienced individuals who were much less / not qualified.
Learning makes you feel that you are on top of your game and NOT growing old  since you are constantly learning something new every single day, expanding horizons and upgrading yourself with new ideas/ insights.
Being a Lifelong Learner can keep you motivated at office  since any new job role or additional responsibility you take on, can then be viewed as a learning opportunity or as a new skill upgrade.

"Goals have a powerful way of keeping us emotionally engaged with work and more focused. Knowing your True North and where you are headed in life, and then aligning that path to your job role is an easy way to link your personal goals and career goals together. "

Make Lasting Relationships
Strong bonds keep people together and are the life blood of organizations that keep high performance teams in play. Creating long lasting and strong relationships at office will drive you to go the extra mile at work and contribute whole heartedly to your job role, while surrounded by the people you trust.
The most successful leaders invest their time and efforts to create strong relationships within their teams  since this is a key driver ensuring optimal team productivity and motivation levels.
Convert Obstacles into Opportunities
Opportunities for growth and improvement may come in different forms at the work place. It may come as a compulsory transfer to another department or branch, maybe as a new job assignment or maybe a team reshuffle with some new members joining your team.
Neuroscience has shown that the human brain is programmed by default to keep human beings within certain comfort zones, when facing particular life situations. This is why some types of change seem hard at first and can bring down our motivation levels at work. But if we are willing to exit our comfort zones, we will then be able to see the positive side and actually convert a problem into a learning opportunity. This is known as Neuroplasticity. Through this process - temporary changes can crystallize into long term changes (Human Learning) via consistent disciplined practice and are part of the brains learning curve.
The most successful leaders embrace this Growth Mindset, for they know that beyond comfort zones lie growth and opportunities.

MS, MR, RW should form national govt.- Wiggy
	
Former Northern Province Chief Minister C.V. Wigneswaran said yesterday that the current political crisis could be resolved by forming a national government with the involvement of President Maithripala Sirisena, Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa and UNP Leader Ranil Wickremesinghe.
He expressed his views while participating at a programme to present awards to regional artistes held at the Cultural Theatre Hall in Vavuniya.
"There is a conflict between the Executive and the Legislature. It is not constitutional. We have to resolve this. I have made a suggestion for it. There are other ways to do it. I will expand on this later. Unless we resolve this now, we do not know what will happen in the future," he said.
He said he had no intention to contest either a provincial council election or a general election if called. Yet, he said he would contest whatever election the people want him to. "There are numerous requests for me to contest parliamentary elections. It can happen," he said.(Sithum Chathuranga)

New wife unknowingly gave her husband a rag
	
A story that was reported from the Rajarata region can act as a classic example as to why men should ideally buy their own footwear after fitting them on and not leave the task to their wives.
The story is of a young man who holds a prominent position in the tourism industry and was held in high esteem by his employers. He was also newly married. Due to his likeability he was often called upon to represent his company at training sessions held in Colombo.
Since he was due to attend a seminar in Colombo of behalf of his office, the first since he entered into matrimony, he decided to go home and tell his wife the good news. His wife was also proud of her husband and to show her support for his endevours she proceeded to buy him several shirts and trousers along with a pair of shoes.
Having got all his things organised he took off to the venue of the seminar in Colombo. A day before the event he decided inspect his kit for the next day that was carefully selected and packed for him by his wife. The shirt and trouser she had chosen were fine and he then tried on the new pair of shoes she had bought for him and as he walked up and down he felt a difference in the two shoes. He took them off and inspected them and they both appeared to be the same size. He then proceeded to take a measuring tape and measured the two and found to his horror that they were two different sizes. He then called up his wife and went on a tirade about how careless she was and how much trouble she had put him into by her actions.
He was then forced to go to the closest shoe shop and get himself a pair of shoes that fit him so that he could attend the training the following day.(Chapa Madubhashi)

## Title: North in Crisis Times

North in Crisis Times
	

ven as the political crisis in the parliament and of government rages on, a near silence pervades the North. People are either indifferent or intentionally avoiding public engagement. The Tamil media, while extensively reporting political developments, paints the crisis as unrelated to the Tamil community, or uses it to bash the TNA, or in turn to claim that strong Tamil demands should be placed by the TNA on the parties vying for power in the South.
There have only been a few small public fora and no mobilizations in the North addressing the state of democracy and legitimacy of the Government amidst this crisis. However, in private conversations, a palpable fear emerges harking back to the dark post-war years under the Rajapaksa regime.
Regardless of how the parliamentary crisis is resolved, what are the reasons for the lack of engagement from the North during this moment of national significance How have developments in the post-war years contributed to such a perspective in the North
Power grab
Part of the reason for the Norths indifference, and for that matter other regions of the country, is that media attention is limited to the confrontation between the executive and the legislative arms of the state, theatrics in parliament and the outcome of court cases. Furthermore, public mobilizations and protests have for the most part been happening within Colombo.
President Sirisena has suffered considerable credibility, and by his own act of appointing MR as Prime Minister made his own political future irrelevant. Without a significant political and social base, Sirisena will only be capable of interventions with the presidential powers at his disposal for at most another year.
The UNP led by Ranil Wickremesinghe is hardly capitalizing on the premature power grab reflecting a major political misjudgement that can undermine and de-legitimise MR. While he has lost his momentum after the local government elections in February, the UNP has yet to mobilize its base outside Colombo, pointing to its weakness in any electoral contest with the well-oiled electoral machine of MR.
The MR loyalists having taken a legitimacy hit are sticking to their guns and dragging out an unenviable situation in the hope the courts will come through in their favour on December 7, legitimizing the dissolution of parliament and early general elections. They are shamelessness in the face of various actors pointing to their illegitimate and naked stint in power over the last month.
In this context, the TNA has taken a commendable and strong stand in parliament exposing the power grab. While the Tamil media is spinning it as TNAs instrumental support for the UNP in return for Tamil demands, the TNAs strength has been its clear positions against the violations of constitutional and parliamentary norms. However, much like the UNP, the TNA has limited its efforts to moves in parliament and the courts, and in its weaker moments meeting with the diplomats.
The TNA acts as if holding together its fourteen members in parliament itself is an achievement, and has hardly communicated to, much less mobilized, the Northern population around the political crisis. Indeed, since the end of the war, the TNA is merely strung together by a lose group of individual leaders with neither a mobilisable party machine nor a committed social base. Their electoral fortunes, which took a major hit in the local government elections in February, have been for the most part due to the legacy of the Federal Party and the lack of a credible Tamil political alternative.
Northern predicament
While the limelight is on the political manoeuvres in Colombo, the lack of concern in the North is revealing of developments during the post-war years. Perhaps the two most important post-war political events in the North were the Northern Provincial Council (NPC) elections in September 2013 and the defeat of the authoritarian MR regime in January 2015. Those elections brought considerable hope to the people in the North and were shaped by the moves of the TNA.To be fair to the Sirisena-Wickremesinghe Government over the last three years, it is to their credit that the dark cloud of militarized surveillance and climate of fear lifted in the North, after years of post-war repression under the MR regime.Sirisena through his many visits to the North also pushed for the release of lands held by the military. Peoples public engagement and protests on a range of issues in the North became a new political chapter. Here, the continued expansion of democratic space in the North was thanks to the initiatives of local people and social movements on a range of issues, while their political representatives remained distant from such issues.
In this context, the political apathy in the North with respect to the current parliamentary crisis and representative democracy, I would argue, are linked to the dashed hopes of the people over the last few years. The failures of the NPC led by former Chief Minister C.V. Wigneswaran and the Sirisena-Wickremesinghe Government on a range of crucial social and economic concerns affecting the war-torn people have been a setback towards rebuilding interest in representative democracy after decades of disruption due to the civil war. Here, the TNA has to take considerable blame for the failures in the North.

"The failures of the NPC led by former Chief Minister C.V. Wigneswaran and the Sirisena-Wickremesinghe Government on a range of crucial social and economic concerns affecting the war-torn people"
The TNA swept the NPC elections, but failed to deliver even a modicum of results. Wigneswaran with his polarizing antics, lack of concern for the people and shift towards narrow Tamil nationalism was at the centre of this failure. However, the TNA having brought Wigneswaran to power was ultimately responsible; they should have controlled him or thrown him out. There is considerable resentment among the northern population, about the arrogance and lack of delivery by the NPC; particularly with the people suffering from the post-war economic crisis aggravated by rising indebtedness, collapsing livelihoods and a devastating long drought.
Similarly, the TNA swept the parliamentary election of August 2015 in the North. With a significant block in parliament, where the TNA consistently voted with the Wickremesinghe Government at every Budget after that, it did not have the vision or capacity to deliver the necessary economic support for the North. Sadly, the ex-Resettlement Minister D. M. Swaminathan, hand-picked by Ranil, ran amok with reconstruction initiatives.
Hardly a small fraction of the war devastated houses in the North were built under Swaminathan, as he insisted on the disastrous Arcelor Mittal 65,000prefabricated steel houses; a housing scheme environmentally inappropriate for the North, not used any local labour where unemployment was high and been a blow to national finances with a massive external loan of US$ 1 billion. The Arcelor Mittal scheme if implemented would have left an even darker blot on the Wickremesinghe Governments legacy than the Central Bank bond scam.

While the TNAs principled stand against the Arcelor Mittal scheme was welcome, the TNA failed to use its leverage to oust Swaminathan, who with the cabinet reshuffle in May this year was given the portfolio of Northern Development as well. On agriculture, on fisheries, on palmyrah-based production and other rural sectors, the reconstruction work over the last three and a half years of the Wickremesinghe Government has been an abysmal failure. For example, the famous Thickham Distillery, crucial for the livelihoods of oppressed caste toddy tappers in Jaffna to increase their production and incomes, has remained idle for four years. The TNA is answerable for their deep slumber in parliament as the social and economic lives of its constituencies deteriorated.
Democratic path ahead
History is not generous with political openings. The constitutional political solution  the sole concern of the TNA over the last few years that too in the realm of experts as opposed to mobilizing the people  is for all purposes dead in the near future. Regardless of how the current political impasse is resolved, the road ahead is going to be difficult.
These are times, to borrow from the Marxist-thinker Antonio Gramasci, for a war of position. That is ideological battles to confront the undemocratic moves of those in power and resist the ethnic polarization mobilized by the nationalists on all sides. Preserving and expanding the democratic space won over the last few years is a priority for all the people in the country, and particularly the North where the winds of fear are again blowing.
A lesson the rest of the country can learn from the North is that democracy, which is now the subject of debate in Colombo, has for long been undermined in the periphery. Peoples everyday lives whether it be interactions with the social welfare arms of the state such as Samurdhi or the repressive arms of the state such as the police, are of an alienating if not repressive encounter. If rebuilding democracy is the urgent task of the hour, it is important to start from the periphery with issues facing the working and rural people as well as the minorities. When a people-centred democracy begins to make sense for those on the margins, the state structures in Colombo will also fall in place.

OPPO R-Series to enter Sri Lanka Soon
	
Smartphone series that brought a revolution - the internationally acclaimed OPPO R-Series is to enter Sri Lanka soon. OPPO R-series is perhaps one of the most influential smartphone lines in history. They kicked it off with R1 in 2014 and later spawned 10 more R-series phones in the booming smartphone market with each achieving a feat with its unbeatable features.
Being known for the industry-leading design and excellent camera experience, the R-series has made a mark for itself in this crowded smartphone market. Ever since OPPO launched the R1 in 2014, the company has strived hard to look different.
Design
The R-series phones have been amongst the first ones to bring the metallic colors and glass gradients. When the market was drowning with loads of similar looking smartphones in silver, gold and rose gold, OPPO launched the R9 in beautiful Metallic Red back in 2016. They followed it up with the special FC Barcelona edition in Red and Blue mix. The R11 pioneered the crescent curved design that was both aesthetically pleasing and practical. The R15 introduced the beautiful Ruby Red and Cosmic Purple gradient colors.
Camera
The R-series isnt just about the design. It has managed to bring the best of photography to mid-range smartphones. It was when OPPO launched the R-series which gave fabulous pitch-perfect pictures even in low-light that made many ditch the regular point-and-shoot cameras. The R1 came with an f/2.0 aperture lens which was a big deal back in 2013. The OPPO R11 was one of the first phones to come with dual 20MP cameras.
Felicitations
Whilst the R-series stand for REAL, REVOLUTION and REFORM and the process of regeneration OPPO has been felicitated with all big tech awards since the inception of R-series since 2015 from the Most Respected Enterprise in 2015 to 2018's Best User Experience Award of Telecommunication.
OPPO has not been shy in trying new innovations when it comes to its R-series of smartphones. The R-series is a showcase of the companys willingness to innovate and evolve. In many ways, it stands for OPPO itself.
Each subsequent smartphones in the R-series takes inspiration from its predecessor and then takes it to a higher level. So with its next R-series smartphone, the OPPO R17 Pro, Sri Lankan buyers can expect more of the same. This means a better design, improved performance and even better camera performance.

Putin accuses Ukraine of not wanting peace
	

DPA, 02nd DECEMBER, 2018-Russian President Vladimir Putin on Saturday accused Ukraine of not wanting a peaceful solution to its conflict with Russia.
At a press conference at the end of the G20 summit in Buenos Aires, Putin repeated his assertion that the latest incident in the Kerch Strait was a provocation by Ukraine which reflected Kievs attitude.
The ruling party in Kiev was a party of war and as long as its in power, tragedies of this type and the war will continue, Putin argued, adding that it was always blaming Russian aggression for its leadership failures.
Putin has previously suggested that Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko engineered Sundays incident in a bid to improve his chances ahead of next years presidential election, without providing any evidence for the claim.
On Sunday, Russia seized three Ukrainian naval vessels off the Crimean Peninsula, a territory it annexed from Ukraine four years ago.
In the most dangerous flare-up of violence since 2014, the Russian coastguard opened fire and captured the Ukrainian vessels in the Kerch Strait, which links the Sea of Azov and the Black Sea.
Kiev then instituted 30 days of martial law and imposed border controls on Russian men aged between 16 and 60, citing fears that Russia would infiltrate its territory to stage an uprising.

## Title: Seeds of current instability sown at birth of yahapalana Govt.
## Section: Opinion
## Date: 3 December 2018 12:28 am
Seeds of current instability sown at birth of yahapalana Govt.
	

hile the complicated situation that has arisen in parliament today is unprecedented, the origins of this logjam could perhaps be traced back to the period when the yahapalana government was formed. The present instability could be seen as part of a continuum starting with the creation of a National Government in January 2015 - a forced marriage between two traditionally opposed groups from centre-left and centre-right of the political spectrum.
Till the UPFA quit the yahapalana government - ahead of the Presidents sacking of Ranil Wickremesinghe from the job of Prime Minister on Oct. 26, - the UNP-ledcoalition largely depended on the UPFA members for the numbers in parliament. With the new government faced with the charge that it, in turn, lacks a majority, the UPFA has pointed out that Wickremesinghes party had only 41 MPs at the time he was appointed PM in 2015 while they had 162 in the 225-member parliament. Wickremesinghes appointment, based on a campaign pledge, was not the outcome of his party winning an election. Nor was he appointed on the basis of being the MP most likely to command the confidence of parliament.
With the UPFA quitting the coalition, the UNP is now at the mercy of smaller communally-oriented parties without whose support it cannot hope to survive politically. Already it is reported that the TNA and SLMC have pledged support to the UNP that is conditional on their demands being met. Although the total numbers on each side keep shifting daily, it appears the UNF coalition (which includes SLMC, ACMC and DPF members who contested on the UNP ticket) has in the region of 101 MPs while the UPFA claims a figure of around 103. The UNFs ability to muster majorities in the rather strange voting sessions that took place in parliament on Thursday and Friday, which were boycotted by government members, has been entirely thanks to the support of the TNA and JVP. These two groups of 14 and 6 respectively, have become the UNPs props in many respects, but for how long, it is not clear. In reality there is a knife-edge balance between the two main political formations  the SLFP-led UPFA and the UNP-led UNF  and this can at any moment be upset with a few cross-overs purchased on the auction floor that we call parliament today. As the voting public can see, it is the most venal, unscrupulous, and untrustworthy of MPs whose hands are strengthened by this pathetic situation.
The manner in which the 19A was passed is yet another marker of the way in which instability got built into the yahapalana project. It may be recalled that Wickremesinghe at the time proposed changes that would have made the president subordinate to the PM. This outcome was averted by the Supreme Court ruling that said a referendum was required in order to approve sections relating the PM being designated as Head of Cabinet, with powers to appoint ministers and assign their subjects and functions. (The UNF had said it would only go with changes that would not require a referendum). There was inadequate time for public discussion of the hurriedly passed Bill, with 12 pages of amendments reportedly submitted to the SC during the hearing, which the public had no opportunity to contest because they did not know what was in them.

"With the UPFA quitting the coalition, the UNP is now at the mercy of smaller communally-oriented parties"
Wickremesinghes attempts to amend the law so as to make the PM more powerful than the president via the 19A, might throw light on some of the complaints made about him by President Maithripala Sirisena in the wake of his sacking. At a forum with Colombo based foreign correspondents last Sunday (25) the President elaborated on the differences of opinion that surfaced within three weeks of the yahapalana govt. coming into office - starting with the appointment of a cabinet. He said the PM ignored the report of a committee of academics appointed by him to formulate a scientific basis for assigning portfolios. I doubt he even turned the pages of the report he remarked.
He went on to list numerous instances where he said the PM disregarded or sought to over-ride his views. The Central Bank and state banks were removed from the purview of the Finance Ministry and, for the first time, the prime minister took over the Central Bank. Sirisena said Ranil Wickremesinghe was determined to appoint Arjuna Mahendran as Governor of the Central Bank, although he opposed it saying the latter was not a Sri Lankan.
Within three months the first looting of the Central Bank (mudal mankollaya) took place and not long after that there was another similar fraud. Wickremesinghe was not in the least concerned about the biggest financial robbery, he alleged. Like the Central bank bond scam there were so many other cases of corruption he said, he could write a book.However, he felt at the time that he shouldnt clash with Wickremesinghe because he did a lot to make him president, he said.
Wickremesinghes ultra-neoliberal policies destroyed the country, Sirisena alleged. The former kept trying to introduce two Land Bills, but he said he did not allow them. One related to land administration (Idam vidividaana panatha) that would have allowed foreigners to buy any land, both public and privately owned. The other related to setting up a Land Bank, which had similar objectives. It was a very anti-national law he said.

"Regardless of who the PM is, any government in the present circumstances is doomed to be highly unstable"
After the February 10, Local Government polls, Sirisena said he told Wickremesinghe the disastrous result was the outcome of his economic and political policies, and asked him to step down as PM, but he refused. He then asked Karu Jayasuriya and Sajith Premadasa in turn, but they were unwilling to go against their party leader. So you see, I didnt suddenly remove Ranil Wickremesinghe and appoint Mahinda Rajapaksa he asserted. The last straw was the unconcern shown by Wickremesinghe in relation to the plot to assassinate him, the President said. He asserted that all his moves  sacking the PM, appointing a new one, proroguing parliament, and dissolving parliament  were made legally, and only the dissolution has been challenged.
It was against this backdrop, the President categorically ruled out the possibility of re-appointing Wickremesinghe as PM. It would appear he is ready to appoint another candidate, and talks are said to be underway with a view to breaking the deadlock. Meanwhile, both sides are engaged in tactical manoeuvres in parliament.
Regardless of who the PM is, any government in the present circumstances is doomed to be highly unstable. But it will have to hobble along in this state until a general election is called - hopefully sooner rather than later - depending on the Supreme Court verdict on the dissolution of parliament.

Sri Lankas crisis of democracy - EDITORIAL
	
n November 26, 2014, President Sirisena joined hands with the then leader of the Opposition Ranil Wickremesinghe to contest former President Rajapaksa at the 2015 presidential election. A curious coalition of political foes coming together -- not on principles, but with a common aim of unseating the sitting president. 
In the after-glow of his presidential election victory, the new president appointed his comrade-in-arms Wickremesinghe as Premier though the latter was not the leader of the party enjoying a majority in Parliament. The President and his Premier then joined hands to bring in the 19th Amendment to the Constitution, which for all intents and purposes was designed to prevent any President from unilaterally dismissing a Prime Minister in the future. The President went on record to confirm he had voluntarily given up his executive powers. 
However, the loose coalition, comprising two widely differing personalities, holding diametrically opposed political ideologies not based on a common programme of work, was bound to run aground. Within a year, the governing coalition began to fall apart. By early 2018 it became clear that the President was looking for ways to get rid of his Prime Minister. 
On Friday October 26, President Sirisena sacked his Premier, replaced him with ex-President Mahinda Rajapaksa -- the man whom Wickremesinghe and Sirisena came together to oust as President -- and prorogued parliament until November 14 believing that the new Premier would be able to show he had the required majority in the House. 
Wickremesinghe rejected President Maithripalas action saying it was unconstitutional claiming he had a majority in the House. He continued to occupy the Premiers official residence and called for a vote in the House to prove his majority. The President however cited another article of the Constitution which he claimed, allowed him to appoint any Member of Parliament as Premier, who he believed commanded a majority in parliament.When it became apparent his newly-appointed PM did not have a a majority in parliament, on November 9, 2018, the President dissolved parliament. 
On November 10 three political parties -- the UNP, TNA and JVP -- challenged the dissolution of parliament in the Supreme Court and after a two-day hearing, on November 13, the Court issued a Stay Order on the dissolution order until it gave its final determination. In the aftermath of the Courts Stay Order, in keeping with the Presidents directive to reconvene parliament on November 14, the Speaker reconvened parliament. 
On November 14 and 16, the new Prime Minister was unable to prove his majority in parliament. On November 29, parliament passed a motion curtailing funds to the Prime Ministers office with 123 MPs voting for the motion. On November 30, parliament passed another motion curtailing funds to ministers and deputy ministers, with 122 voting for the motion with none against as the government was boycotting parliament! 
With the parliamentary votes clearly indicating the presidents nominee did not enjoy the confidence of a majority in the House, the president was forced into damage control mode. On November 30, the President began meeting other parties in parliament including his erstwhile foe, the UNP led by immediate past Premier Wickremesinghe. 
In his meeting with the Tamil National Alliance (TNA), President Sirisena finally admitted his newly-appointed PM Rajapaksa did not command the confidence of the majority in the House and suggested a motion requesting him to appoint a new PM. 
The wheel had turned full circle. 
After over a month, the country was thrown into turmoil by the Presidents ill-advised unilateral sacking of Premier Wickremesinghe, the President had now to eat humble pie. Many feel the country has had no Prime Minister or legal government for a month or more. The country has been made a laughing stock internationally. But Sri Lanka has gone through worse and bounced back. 
Not too long ago, (during the insurgency) no one knew, once they left home whether they would return alive. We lived through an era where headless bodies littered the streets, where white vans kidnapped people, where journalists disappeared or were killed for writing the truth, where bus-loads of civillians were ambushed and slain in cold blood. A time when religious men and women were killed by government authorities and terrorists alike. 
These memories make the present crisis look like a storm in a tea cup. Our Constitution though often maligned has now shown, checks and balances are in place. The systems kicked back and democracy will still be saved.

## Title: STOP OUTSOURCING DEMOCRACY!
## Section: Opinion

STOP OUTSOURCING DEMOCRACY!
	

In a democracy, constitutions can be drafted, revised or replaced by the people as they wish, but when such a sovereign nation is disintegrated through a constitution (or by some other means), it can hardly be reintegrated into unity. Sri Lanka is today being threatened by one of the worst existential crises it has ever encountered since independence in 1948. According to one predominant point of view, there appears to be a constitutional conspiracy backed by geopolitics-driven foreign forces to undermine its unitary status. Many legal and constitutional experts, some of them politicians, convincingly argue that the 20th Amendment (20A) is designed to clear the way for the implementation of a fully fledged federal constitution unsuitable for Sri Lanka camouflaged under a self-contradictory aekeeya/orumittha label, against the will of the overwhelming majority of the politically savvy Sri Lankan citizens. The 19th Amendment (19A) seems to be a live constitutional landmine.
Sarath Kalugamage, convener of a civil interest group named Ratata Hetak, alleges that the 19A has effectively robbed the people of their sovereignty through the inclusion of an article in terms of which the president cannot dissolve parliament before the lapse of four and a half years, because such a stipulation makes it impossible for a malfunctioning, corrupt legislature like the one under the Yahapalanaya to be brought to an end, enabling the people to elect a new parliament as per their inalienable right. It has been queried by responsible citizens how a piece of legislation (i.e., that which obstructs the Executive Presidents power to dissolve parliament during the first four and-a-half years of its term if the need arises) which should have been passed by a 2/3rds majority in parliament and in addition should have been approved by the people at a general referendum, got into the statute book. Already there is a call for the annulment of 19A by a future government. It is now patently clear that, constitutional or unconstitutional, only the election of a new parliament will save the Sri Lankan nation and its democracy from anarchy.  

"The President dissolved parliament and appointed a new prime minister on October 26, 2018 in accordance with powers vested in him by the Constitution, though now the sudden dismissal of the dysfunctional yahapalana government is being challenged by the sacked Prime Minister and his allies"

Maithripala Sirisena is still the Executive President of the country, where constitutionally, sovereignty resides in the people. He was elected in January 2015 by the people of the country (though this was not under ideal conditions owing to brazen foreign involvement) to exercise that sovereignty on their behalf. The President cant relinquish his official prerogatives, much less his official responsibilities, under any circumstances. He dissolved parliament and appointed a new PM on October 26, 2018 in accordance with powers vested in him by the Constitution, though now the sudden dismissal of the dysfunctional yahapalana government is being challenged by the sacked Prime Minister and his allies. The news about Mahinda Rajapaksa (MR) having formed a government at the invitation of the president generated a wave of public euphoria across the country: firecrackers were set off in celebration not only in the south but also in the north.
Having said that, personally, I remain somewhat skeptical (though less than before) about the sincerity of President Sirisenas latest volte-face in his relations with his erstwhile leader and close associate MR. It is my sincere hope, nevertheless, that the turn of events will finally be in the best interest of the country. No Sri Lankan would have been more delighted than me by a proper rapprochement between the two of them. I was among the earliest who urged such an MR-Maithri burying of the hatchet for the greater good of the country, but I never hoped for this kind of reconciliation that seems to have been forced by Sirisenas own currently vulnerable circumstances! To recall the past, what Maithripala did by his controversial election eve statement in August 2015 that he wont make MR Prime Minister even if he won a majority of seats (which was a certainty according to opinion polls at the time) put paid to the kind of hope for genuine reconciliation that I, with so many other ordinary citizens, entertained: because his words so severely demoralized the pro-MR voters that a substantial number of them didnt cast their vote in their frustration.

	"Already there is a call for the annulment of 19A by a future government"
	
	
	"20A drafted by anti-national separatist sympathizers is proving to be a noose flung around unitary Sri Lanka"
	

A third time Maithripala let MR down was when, more recently, he prevented Ranil Wickremesinghe from being defeated by a no confidence motion that he (Sirisena) himself was instrumental in bringing against him. The suspicion rankles in my mind (as it could in others) whether President Sirisena is again leading MR (with his three times proven naivety) up the garden path, for his usual way is not to spill the beans before time. However, the cogency of the reasons he adduces for his action (e.g., suspected UNP complicity in an alleged plot to assassinate him, crucial policy differences between Ranils UNP and Maithripalas SLFP rump, personality clashes, obvious popular disapproval of their uneasy alliance, the role that Ranil has played in the Central Bank bond scam, etc) seems to be a guarantee against backtracking at this stage.
On the other hand, however, the current circumstances suggest that this time MR cannot be thought to be acting out of his inherent naivety with regard to character-reading his associates (an accompaniment of his generous nature). Four years of Yahapalanaya has wrecked the countrys economy and has completely stalled the robust countrywide development programmes that had started during the previous MR regime that was toppled at the beginning of 2015. Starting during the period of Yahapalanaya (2015-18) the LKR has fallen from Rs.131 to the US$ at the end of 2014 to Rs.180 at present; the poorest of the poor were persecuted by increased taxation; many valuable national assets were sold or earmarked for sale; local industrialists were heavily taxed while foreign investors were given tax concessions; the agrarian sector was deliberately discouraged or neglected; the countrys independence was pointlessly surrendered to paid bureaucrats serving the interests of the so-called international community which are clearly inimical to the well-being of our Motherland. A recrudescence of common crimes has been in evidence, so has mega scale corruption in the highest places in government. Separatist sentiments began being fanned in the north.
In this background, the camouflaged 20A drafted by anti-national separatist sympathizers is proving to be a noose flung around the neck of unitary Sri Lanka. Its intended passage (presumably the same way that unconstitutional articles were smuggled into19A at the committee stage) would have been tantamount to the release of the trapdoor under the prisoners feet. This danger  the strongest reason behind the presidents decision and MRs acquiescence)  will not disappear until fresh parliamentary elections are held and a new government formed that answers to the aspirations of all Sri Lankans, not those of foreign powers who are only following their own selfish national interests.

"During Yahapalanaya (2015-18) the LKR has fallen from Rs.131 against US$ at the end of 2014 to Rs.180 at present"
So, the dissolution of parliament is the need of the hour. But this is not an easy prospect. For one thing, a significant number of the incumbent members of parliament (I am calling them incumbent because the presidential dissolution of parliament has been judicially suspended until December 5) are not likely to favour this idea for two reasons, not necessarily equally applicable to all of them. There are two groups of these individuals: those who want the parliament elected in August 2015 to continue until the end of its original term for the express purpose of taking an irreversible step towards the separatist goal that terrorism could not reach militarily, by further tinkering with the 1978 Constitution in the form of 20A; and they have NGO, foreign and some local support; the other group comprises those who are worried about their attractive pension rights which they must forfeit when parliament is dissolved before five years are completed. Besides, as the president who headed the Yahapalanaya himself admitted recently, under it some MPs willingly became purchasable at astronomical prices. What better argument than this for supporting the idea of dissolving parliament at this juncture

## Title: The Director of Last Emperor, Bernardo Bertolucci dies at 77: No More Tango

The Director of Last Emperor, Bernardo Bertolucci dies at 77: No More Tango
	

s we grew up movie-mad, there were those directors, who held us in awe  Orson Welles, David Lean, Akira Kurosawa, Sathyajith Ray, Vittorio de Sica, Andrej Wajda, Alain Resnais, Francois Truffaut, Norman Jewison, Sergei Eisenstein, Sergio Leone and more. 
This list is both low and high brow, and incomplete. Bernardo Bertolucci (high-brow) came late into the list and worked his way effortlessly to the top even though Ive seen only three of his films to date  the Little Buddha, The Last Emperor, and Last Tango in Paris. 
Of these three, Little Buddha is not regarded highly by critics. It is an elegiac tribute to the life of the Buddha, not a soul-searching cinematic journey like Conrad Rooks film Siddhartha, based on Herman Hesses novel. 
It was a sentimental exploration of a search for personal liberation through Indian philosophy and spirituality, and a startling departure from the strong political stances that Bertoluccis other films took, which may be why it fell short of critical expectations. 
After the shock of Bertoluccis death at 77 from cancer (He was one of those who seemed eternally young), it is time to look for those films I have missed. 
Among Europes elite filmmakers, he was unique in breaking through to Hollywood and making films without losing his artistic integrity. The Last Emperor (1987) was his breakthrough movie. It won nine Oscars and confirmed his ability to make epics in the style of David Lean.
Bertolucci was born in Parma in 1941. His father, a poet and teacher, was a friend of filmmaker Pier Pasolini, who gave the young Bertolucci his break into Italian cinema. After working with Sergio Leone on his epic Western Once Upon A Time in the West, Bertolucci got his big break directing the 1970 movie The Conformist in which Jean-Louis Trintignant acts the role of a young gay man who joins the fascists. 
The movie reflected Bertoluccis radical Left-wing politics. I live in a kind of dream of Communism, he once said. But he became disillusioned with politics as he grew older and did not even vote in the latter stages of his life. He was criticised for working for former premier Silvio Berlusconis film company Medusa Film. Bertolucci was openly contemptuous of the politicians wild lifestyle and political corruption. But Berlusconi never interfered with the directors work and gave him a free hand. 
After many, many years, I fell out of love with politics. Its not something I like but its the truth. Bertolucci told an interviewer during the last year of his life. 
The Last Emperor was impressive, but it was the Last Tango in Paris (1972) which made the deepest impression on me. It stars Marlon Brando and Maria Schneider (A 19-year-old French actress making her debut) and the storys about a casual encounter between the two in Paris which develops into a series of sexual encounters. 
The film was a revelation in many ways. Filmed by Bertoluccis cinematographer Vittorio Storaro in a very seductive style (the effect is enhanced by the saxophone drenched soundtrack and great theme music by jazz composer Gato Barbieri) this film displaced a number of complacent assumptions in my mind about filmmaking, acting and sexuality (both in film and out of it) which havent been answered to this day. 
Brando (A middle-aged American hotelier called Paul) and Schneider (Jeanne) meet casually and Paul insists from the start that they remain anonymous throughout the relationship. But this emotional distance becomes impossible to maintain. He is rough, even brutal, in his approach. This was a culture shock. Sex, like food or language, is cultural. 
The shock of what Brando and Schneider carried out on screen looked to me like a clash of civilizations  his and hers. From my own perspective, violence against women in love and marriage is something we come across as domestic violence. 
But this was nothing like it, and she suffers it willingly before finally breaking away. Brando finally admits to loving her (Im in love with you, you dummy) but by then its too late. 
The film outraged some critics for its depiction of sex and was blacklisted in festivals when a video released much later revealed that the full details of a key scene of a sexual encounter between Brando and Schneider had not been revealed to her by the director (The scene has been re-instated since). 
It has been suggested that the role may have damaged Schneiders subsequent career. But Bertolucci remained unrepentant. After Schneiders premature death in 2011, he told an interviewer: 
Poor Maria. I didnt have the occasion to go to ask her to forgive me. She was a 19-year-old who, like the actors in Me and You, had never acted before. Maybe, sometimes in the movie, I didnt tell her what was going on because I knew her acting would be better. So, when we shot this scene with Marlon [Brando] using butter on her, I decided not to tell her. I wanted a reaction of frustration and rage. 
American film critic Pauline Kael said that Last Tango was the most important cultural event since Stravinskys The Rite of Spring. It defined the cultural battle lines between the reactionary Right and the progressive Left in the West.
Bertoluccis post-Last Tango fame made it possible to shoot his next epic, 1,900 (Filmed in 1976) with big stars such as Robert De Niro, Gerard Depardieu and Burt Lancaster. 
His last film was Me and You, based on a novel by Niccolo Ammaniti. He has been married since 1978 to filmmaker Clare Peploe, and the couple had no children.

TNA support for UNP: TELO insists on written agreement citing 5 demands
	
The Tamil Eelam Liberation Organization (TELO), which is an ally of the Tamil National Alliance (TNA), has resolved that any form of support given to the United National Party (UNP) to form a government should be based on a written agreement to address the issues concerning Tamils, a party official said yesterday.
The TNA said last week that it would support the UNP to form a government, but without accepting any portfolio in that government.
TELO is one of the four parties that form the TNA and has two MPs, Selvam Adaikkalanathan and K. Kotheeswaran, elected on their ticket. The Central Committee of TELO met in Vavuniya on Saturday to discuss the situation. It decided that the TNA should strike an agreement with the UNP for the formation of a government on five counts. However, the party decided not to disclose these five areas of concern to be included in the agreement until a final decision was taken.
Its Central Committee member M.K. Sivajilingam told Daily Mirror yesterday that the coordinating committee of the TNA comprising representing all its allies would meet this evening in Colombo to discuss the matter further.We know it is difficult for a minority government to find a solution to the Tamil national question.
We are looking for an interim solution at least to begin with. If the TNA supports the UNP, it should be conditional and an agreement needs to be signed. Unless the TNA agrees to this demand of ours we will take our own decision on it separately, he said.(Kelum Bandara)
