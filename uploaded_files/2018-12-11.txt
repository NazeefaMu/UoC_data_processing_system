Coca-Cola ?Gives Back Life? to 400KG of PET plastic bottles during the Sri Lanka-England cricket ser
	
Coca-Cola ?Gives Back Life? tCoca-Cola Beverages Sri Lanka Ltd recently completed yet another successful ?Give Back Life? campaign in partnership with Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) and Eco Spindles Pvt Ltd, during the Sri Lanka-England cricket series which was held from 10th October to 27th November 2018. The ?Give Back Life? partnership with SLC continues to make a difference by collecting and recycling thousands of PET plastic bottles at Cricket stadiums in Galle, Colombo, and Dambulla. ?Give Back Life? encourages people to give new life to their PET bottles through a recycling process by Eco Spindles that coverts them into clothing, shoes, brushes and brooms, thereby adding value by preserving our unique environment and creating new livelihoods.
?
With custom-designed PET bottle collection bins placed at these cricket stadiums, the Coca-Cola team oversaw the collection of approximately a total of 400kg of PET plastic bottles over the course of the nine matches. Clad in ?Give Back Life? t-shirts, the Coca-Cola staff on the grounds were actively involved in collecting used bottles while spreading the message and inspiring numerous spectators to join in.
?
Commenting on SLC partnering with Coca-Cola once again following the South Africa-Sri Lanka cricket series to recycle disposed PET plastic bottles, Jerome Jayaratne ? Chief Operating Officer, SLC stated: ?The highly anticipated Sri Lanka-England tournament this year, drew large crowds to our stadiums from far and wide. With Coca-Cola having always been a strong supporter and advocate of the sport of cricket in Sri Lanka, we are very pleased to have been able to join its efforts in recycling and waste management through the ?Give Back Life? campaign for PET plastic bottles. Since its inception, this island-wide campaign has continued to gain momentum and make a significant impact across the nation. It was very inspiring to see the cricket fans in and around the stadiums giving up a few moments of their time to pick up used bottles and dispose of them in a responsible manner. The Coca-Cola team certainly did an excellent job of spreading the ?Give Back Life? message among hundreds of cricket fans who were present during the series and we hope that they continue making strides with this far-reaching cause.?
?
Lakshan Madurasinghe - Country Public Affairs, Communications and Sustainability Manager, Coca-Cola Beverages Sri Lanka Ltd. also commented:?Our second ?Give Back Life? campaign with SLC during the Sri Lanka-England cricket series yet again proved to be a successful effort and we hope that it took us one step closer to creating the habit for everySri Lanka to dispose their waste appropriately to better serve the country. This partnership with SLC and Eco Spindles enabled us to inspire numerous cricket fans across the island to rethink the way they handle waste and understand the tangible value of their used PET plastic bottles. Through more and more dynamic partnerships such as this, we hope to continue making a positive impact, one PET plastic bottle at a time.?
Coca-Cola has continued to build on its partnerships with various local government authorities, civil society groups, NGOs and corporates, leveraging them to provide robust PET recovery solutions across the island. Through its multi-stakeholder, volunteer clean-ups and collection programmes, the ?Give Back Life? campaign also drives community mobilization. Coca-Cola continues its plans to work with a host of partners in the coming years to deliver Coca-Cola?s ?World Without Waste? packaging vision, which includes collecting and recycling a bottle for every 1 it sells by 2030.

Complaint lodged at CID for twisting identity of Beruwala drug peddler
	
A compliant was lodged at the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) today against the false rumors that a close associate of Gotabaya Rajapaksa was allegedly involved in an incident where a large heroin haul weighing 231.5 kilogrammes was seized at Beruwala on December 5.
The complaint was lodged by Attorney Gamini Ekanayake claiming that the false rumor had gone viral in the social media where a picture is being circulated in which Mr. Gotabaya and an individual named Mohammad Najmi appearing together.
Speaking to the media, Ekanayake said the police had arrested three suspects in connection to the incident among them one was Mohammad Rizwan.
He said MP Ranjan Ramanayake and Ninzer Nizamudeen have published certain posts in social media twisting the identity of real suspect who is in police custody and denies any link between the suspect and Mr. Gotabaya Rajapaksa.
He said this was done intentionally with the motive of tarnishing the reputation of Mr. Gotabaya Rajapaksa. (Sheain Fernandopulle)

## Title: Distortion of Names
## Section: Opinion

Distortion of Names
	
Our sister paper Lankadeepa on Thursday reported that 35 students of Paanama Sinhala Maha Vidyalaya had to submit affidavits to sit for the GCE Ordinary Level examinations, as their names in their national identity cards and examination admission cards had been distorted. It said that lack of knowledge in Sinhala among the officials in Batticaloa Divisional Secretariat had caused the blunder and this had seriously affected the young minds of the concerned candidates of the examination.??
Very few in the country might know that the matter is a minor manifestation of a larger issue that had largely contributed to the thirty-year long war which claimed nearly hundreds of thousands of lives. That is why we chose to discuss the issue which might have been ignored by the large majority of the population.??
Needless to say that the psychological effect of the incident has the potential to dishearten at least some of the students affected by the blunder made by the officials. The Lankadeepa story further states that this was not the first time Paanama school students had faced this problem. In fact, it cannot be only Paanama students who had been faced with this injustice, as in many places and on many occasions names of people belonging to one linguistic community are written in official documents by the members of another linguistic community.??
Though this issue might have so far been new or trivial to the Sinhalese community, distortion of names of Tamil-speaking people in official documents by the Sinhalese officials is a long drawn or decade-long complaint among the Tamil-speaking communities -- Tamils and Muslims. Especially distortion of names in birth certificates, marriage certificates, death certificates, identity cards, and title deeds etc., had been a continuous complaint. And this and the correspondence between the state and the Tamil-speaking people in Sinhala language had been a part of a greater issue called the language problem.? ?
It is a well-known fact that the war between the Tamil armed groups and the armed forces triggered in 1970s and 1980s was a violent political manifestation of frustration against the language issue that came to a head with the introduction of the Official Language Act of 1956, commonly known as the ?Sinhala Only? Act, among others. And as we have mentioned above the distortion of names in documents and sign boards is a long drawn indication of the language problem.? ?
Despite Tamil Language also becoming an Official Language through the much talked-about Indo-Lanka Accord of 1987 and the resultant controversial 13th Amendment to the Constitution, Tamil media still complain about distortion of names of people and places in official documents and sign boards. In Colombo alone there are so many sign boards of government institutions where the names are wrongly written. They also lament on the government officials corresponding with the Tamil-speaking people in Sinhala.?
?
On the other hand, Sinhalese in the Northern and Eastern Provinces, like the students of Paanama also complain about the distortion of their names and correspondence with them in Tamil. Hence, in spite of the Tamil armed rebellion being militarily suppressed nearly ten years ago, we still have to discuss about the causes of ethnic distrust.? ?
Some 25 years ago, the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress (SLMC), on behalf of the Tamils and the Muslims in the coastal areas of Ampara District, demanded a separate Kachcheri or a District Secretariat in Kalmunai manned by officials conversant in Tamil. The reason they cited was the inability of the Tamil-speaking people in those areas to interact with the Sinhalese officials at the Ampara District Secretariat who were not conversant in Tamil. However, some elements among the politicians and the media depicted it as a separatist demand and it is still an unresolved issue.? ?
Despite we, the journalists, too sometimes making mistakes in this regard, we are taught to pay special care when writing names, as nobody likes to see his/her name distorted and hence nobody has the right to distort another person?s name. Since Sinhala and Tamil languages are phonetically written, they are more prone to make mistakes in this regard.??
Despite some issues seeming to be trivial, they might have the potential to create crises involving an entire nation, as we witnessed for over 30 years since 1970s.? ?

Equality for all,  not just the chosen few

Butterflies for Democracy is LGBTIQ community members coming together under a common banner against homophobia, misogyny, racism, sexism and inequality
	We are no longer a hidden community quaking in our boots, but a vibrantly open and brave community that are willing to risk their lives and their reputations to fight for democracy and freedom
?
In the light of the recent political turmoil in our country it is fair to say we have witnessed, and not for the first time, the ugliness of politics in Sri Lanka. That politicians from all sides can play with our lives, squabble pettily and behave in the most ungracious and ugly way is so unbecoming of their stature and goes to reiterate that politicians are only in office for their own gain and have no good intention to serve the people as they should rightly be doing. That our President, the highest power in the land, stoops to flinging homophobic slurs, wishes his wife, who apparently worships him on bent knee each day, is born a man so she will reach the ultimate avatar on her way to nirvana is only indicative of the decay of sensibility and good character that is prevalent in this land today.??
Butterflies for Democracy is LGBTIQ community members coming together under a common banner against homophobia, misogyny, racism, sexism and inequality. From the first protest at Liberty Circle along with the Pro-Democracy groups protesting against the complete disregard the President has shown for the constitution and democracy, the Butterflies for Democracy came together to protest at the President?s use of the word Butterfly to derogatorily refer to the PM and some of his cabinet members? perceived sexual orientation in an offensive fashion. However, the latest protest by the LGBTIQ community at Lipton Circle on December 7, 2018, was to remind those factions in the government that are anti-LGBTIQ, that we are citizens of this country deserving of all rights as outlined in our Constitution. We are also voters who have the might of over four million strong in this country. Our parliamentarians must work for us, not the other way around. It is time therefore, that democracy is restored in our island nation. It?s time for changes to afford rights for all citizens. It?s time for legal reform to change the archaic British Laws criminalizing consenting same sex relationships. It?s time to embrace equality and forward thinking and make our country a beacon of hope, tolerance and acceptance for all.? ?
As the press release on the protest said: ?Politicising and denigrating the LGBTIQA community has been the mantra of conservative politicians in order to garner votes and scare people into thinking that being LGBTIQ is some sort of sickness or perversion ? neither of which is true and neither of which can be proved scientifically or medically.? What is even more worthwhile is that this is the first time the LGBTIQ community have come together to step out publicly, showing their faces proudly, to demand their rights. We are no longer a hidden community quaking in our boots, but a vibrantly open and brave community that are willing to risk their lives and their reputations to fight for democracy and freedom.? ?
?
?
The systematic discrimination and marginalization that has been firmly entrenched in our society for 135 years continues, over and over again. While successive governments have focused on building dams, highways, ports, airports and mega port cities, they have missed the wood for the trees. In all of this development the most important factor of all, has been glaringly and purposely omitted ? human development. How can we move forward as a nation if our thinking is still stuck in the Victorian era? How can we be a developed nation if our people are unable to think broadly and inclusively? Development cannot be measured by the wealth of the nation, but only in the depth of the people and their ability to embrace diversity, accept difference and divest from racism, homophobia, sexism and misogyny.?
This has to be foremost on the agenda of all politics, regardless of personal gain or personal biases. Safeguarding our national assets, our flora and fauna, investing in our youth, protecting our children and our women and creating opportunities for all our citizens, equally. Eliminating poverty, revamping our school curriculum to teach broader human substance ? the list may seem endless, but a start is needed, and needed badly. And all need to be addressed in a systematic non-partisan way.??
It is no surprise that the world economic index of 2018 has indicated that the most developed countries in the world are countries such as Norway, Netherlands, Sweden, Finland, New Zealand, Australia, Switzerland, USA and Canada, to name a few. These countries also all accept Marriage equality and have nondiscriminatory policies safeguarding their LGBTI citizens. They also have implicit policies of eco conservation and protection, gender parity, child protection etc., all toward safeguarding its citizens and promoting equality and freedom.? ?
Butterflies for Democracy symbolises the anticipation of social change, the hope of freedom and dignity, a deep respect for life and diversity. It is time Sri Lanka ? it is time to set the butterflies free.??
?It takes no compromise to give people their rights...it takes no money to respect the individual. It takes no political deal to give people freedom. It takes no survey to remove repression.?? ?

Growing strong: The quest to accelerate progress in early childhood development
	
?
Investing in children?s growth will advance health and development. Doing so must be a priority?
Early childhood is arguably the most crucial stage of life. Brains develop. Bodies grow. Social skills are learnt and character is built. So important are the early stages of life that they can define a person?s future, from the likelihood of lifelong health to outcomes in cognitive and physical ability. This in turn affects the prospect of living a full and productive life and making a positive contribution to society. Accelerating region-wide health and development is therefore incumbent on investing in early childhood and ensuring each and every child gets the best?start possible.??
The potential to do so is clear. In recent years WHO South-East Asia?s Member States have made dramatic progress in reducing child mortality. Between 1990 and 2017,for example, under-5 mortality was slashed by 70%. Neo-natal mortality declined by 60%. Last year alone, 3.5 million more children under-5 ? including 1.3 million newborns ? survived as compared to 1990, with almost all Member States achieving the Millennium Development Goal on reducing child mortality. Commendably, four Member States have already met the global Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) target on under-five mortality. These outcomes are in keeping with the Region?s Flagship Priority of ending preventable maternal, newborn and?child deaths.? ?
As Member States sustain this progress, the need to invest additional resources in Early Childhood Development (ECD) must be grasped. At the same time as enhancing health equity, research shows that for every dollar spent on ECD the return can be as high as 13 times, due in large part to ECD?s capacity to help overcome the effects of stunting (which 37% of children in the Region suffer), and other early childhood adversities that can cause poor development, mental health problems, obesity and heart disease among other conditions.? ?
Though enhancing ECD requires action across multiple areas of government, including the education and nutrition sectors, the health sector has a crucial role to play, especially from conception to the age of three, which is the critical period for brain development. As outlined in the recently developed global framework on ?Nurturing Care for Early Childhood Development?, in addition to the Region?s own strategic framework, there are several steps countries can take to advance ECD?s game-changing potential and provide the responsive care needed.??
First, high-level political leadership and buy-in must be secured. Doing so is fundamental to ensuring impactful policies to advance ECD are devised and then implemented at the grassroots, including at primary health care centers. It is also fundamental to ensuring underprivileged or at-risk populations are targeted as a priority. Importantly, adequate funding must be allocated to programmes aimed at enhancing ECD, and must be provided on an ongoing, long-term basis. ?Equity from the start? must be more than a mantra.??
Second, concerted efforts should be made to fortify and scale up interventions, starting from the antenatal period, as part of a broader focus on frontline care. Community health and nutrition workers are crucial to promoting ECD, at the same time as providing ongoing health services for newborns and children, including necessary vaccines, monitoring weight and growth and providing appropriate care where needed. As part of this, the promotion of breastfeeding is vital. Breastfeeding is, after all, proven to provide the strongest foundation for lifelong health and optimal nutrition. It should be encouraged, along with complementary feeding beyond the age of six months.? ?
Third, families should be supported to boost ECD themselves. In the early years of life, parents (whether working or stay-at-home), close family members and caregivers are the best providers of nurturing care, including by giving love, promoting bonding and attachment, and stimulating their newborns and children through age-appropriate activities. Making families aware that simple play and communication for at least one hour a day has the power to shape a child?s destiny should be a priority among policymakers, with effective communication strategies key to achieving this outcome, alongside continued investment in maternal health.? ?
WHO is working to promote these outcomes and support Member States harness the full power of ECD. In addition to working with countries to implement the Region?s strategic framework. This week the Partners? Forum 2018 in New Delhi? will bring together 1200 partners dedicated to implementing the UN Secretary General?s Global Strategy for Women?s, Children?s and Adolescents? Health, including ECD, which is integral to the ?Thrive? objective outlined therein.
The future looks increasingly bright. Region-wide, the quest to accelerate progress in ECD is growing stronger by the day. That quest must continue. It must also be scaled up. ECD?s capacity to revolutionize health and development in the space of just one birth cohort must be fully comprehended and leveraged by both high-level political leaders and citizens alike. Should this happen, and should decisive action be taken, the future will not only be ours; it will be every generation?s to come.?
?
As Member States sustain this progress, the need to invest additional resources in Early Childhood Development (ECD) must be grasped

Lankan babysitter who abused two boys sentenced in Australia
	
A Sri Lankan babysitter who sexually abused two seven-year-old boys in Perth, Australia has been sentenced to five-and-a-half years in prison and is likely to be deported after serving his term, WAtoday reported on Tuesday.
The 19-year-old suspect Dayanthan Stanley Mohanraj was convicted after a trial of four counts of sexually abusing a child in 2016 when he was babysitting on a casual basis.
According to WAtoday, Mohanraj showed one boy pornography and later sexually abused the child in a public toilet, then threatened to kill him if he told his parents what happened.
He abused the same boy in a playroom and on another day attacked both children while they were playing, telling them to keep it a secret, the West Australian District Court heard on Tuesday.
Judge Vicki Stewart said Stanley Mohanraj lacked remorse and was unwilling to accept responsibility for his offending against two vulnerable children, which involved a serious breach of trust.
"You took advantage of these two young boys. This is an abuse of the most serious kind. You were in a position of authority. You were trusted to look after these children. You made comments to each boy to secure their silences,? he said.
Stanley Mohanraj came to Australia from Sri Lanka in 2012, but his family's refugee status has been rejected and they are in the process of appealing in the Federal Court.
He must serve at least three-and-a-half years behind bars before he can be eligible for parole and will then likely be deported.

Madras HC pulls up officer for deporting man to SL
	
The Foreigners Regional Registration Officer (FRRO) is in the dock as the Madras high court has summoned him to personally explain as to why he deported a man of Sri Lankan origin -- but born and brought?up in India ? to Sri Lanka after he returned from Australia where he was denied asylum.
Questioning the rationale behind deporting S Anand to Colombo, a division bench of Justice N Kirubakaran and?Justice Abdul Quddhose rejected the officials? claim that Anand entered Australia illegally by a boat seeking asylum, but after it was denied he ?fraudulently obtained? an Indian emergency certificate from the Indian?embassy in Melbourne.
"If the asylum application of Anand was rejected by the Australian government, he would not be allowed to move out of the refugee camp/asylum seekers camp and there is no scope for the asylum seekers to come out of the camp. Therefore, prima facie it is doubtful as to whether the asylum application of Anand was rejected, as contended by the authorities," the judges said.
They were passing orders on a habeas corpus petition filed by Anand?s father K Sundar Lingam who escaped to?India in 1987 at the height of ethnic crisis in Sri Lanka. Anand was born at Thirumala Devasam Medical College and Hospital, Alappuzha district, Kerala, in 1992. He completed his schooling from a private school in?Redhills, Chennai. In 2013, he went to Australia, but returned to India on October 27, 2018. He was detained by?the Indian immigration authorities and deported to Sri Lanka. Flaying the FRRO, the bench said: ?If the?petitioner's son had fraudulently obtained an Indian emergency certificate from the Melbourne Indian embassy?claiming to be an Indian national and travelled to India, the usual course should be to send him back to the country from where he had travelled. However, surprisingly, the authorities had sent him to Sri Lanka, after?informing the Sri Lankan embassy and obtaining an emergency certificate. When the petitioner's son was born?and brought up and educated in India and he has got no connection at all with Sri Lanka, it is not known why?the authorities deported the petitioner's son to Sri Lanka.?

?Many feel that we should team up with the JVP and it is natural for me to feel the same way and to contemplate whether a new alliance has to be formed with the Marxist party,? he said in his Twitter message.

Motion filed against Prez's request to expedite SC ruling
	
A motion has been filed in the Supreme Court today by a lawyer against the request made by President Maithripala Sirisena asking the Chief Justice to expedite the court ruling on the dissolution of parliament.
In his motion, the lawyer said such requests undermined the hearing of the case. Therefore, he requested the Supreme Court to issue a ruling after considering the motion.
President Maithripala Sirisena said yesterday he would request the Chief Justice through the Attorney General to deliver the order on the dissolution of parliament without further delay. (Thilini De Silva and Ranjan Katugampola)

Plight of Kalpitiya donkeys ?Beasts of burden? now killed for meat
	
?
If you have taken a trip to Mannar, the donkeys would have added much excitement to your sightseeing. These donkeys have made Mannar their home for centuries. The entry of donkeys to the island dates back to the Portuguese and Dutch periods. Although they were not native to the island, donkeys have been used to transport goods from one end to the other and have lived closely with people over the years. But with the increasing number of human settlements and opening up of new agricultural lands, donkeys posed a threat to people. Hence the once domesticated the animal turned into a feral population. Donkeys are also found in Kalpitiya, but they are associated with a different story. However, during the recent past, donkeys are being killed for meat and the flesh is being sold in the guise of beef. As more deaths have occurred and with more animals with signs of human brutality roaming in the area, animal lovers and activists have raised concerns about the threats to these donkeys, already low in numbers.?
?
Hence the Daily mirror? sheds light on the importance of conserving this once important animal which has been ignored today.
?
Mannar 
The land of donkeys?
Mannar boasts of a rich heritage that dates back to the Portuguese and the Dutch periods. With the remnants of the Doric House and a Fort built inland, it?s quite clear that the area was once a busy port, trading goods in and out of the island. As it opened doors for many merchants, it is said that the donkeys were introduced by Arabian traders. With that, donkeys became family to the people of Mannar and are closely linked with Dhobi families (Families engaged in the laundry business). The donkeys were also used as the local taxi service, carrying wives and children to their various destinations. Historical accounts suggest that each family had had between 10-20 animals to transport cloth packs from one pond to the other. What began as such a rich culture has seen the downward spiral of the donkey population during the recent past. Today, the beasts of burden have literally become a burden to people as they damage agriculture.?
Donkeys are also found in Kalpitiya and experts opine that they are a premium population. This is because they are wild and have not been exposed to urban settings. This could also be one reason why they are being killed for meat at a rate. Due to increasing human settlements they are deprived of their natural habitats and therefore make their way into schools and shops, disturbing human activities.?
?
Wounds have infected their brains :?
Animal lover?
?
?
?
?
We then wrote a letter urging the authorities to probe the matter. When we were treating the animals the Police also came to check on us
?
?
?
Speaking to the?Daily mirror , Iresha Weerasinghe, an animal lover who got to know about a wounded donkey, sent a team to Kalpitiya to treat the animal. ?It was then that we found out that there were more wounded donkeys. We then got to know that people are selling donkey meat as beef and it has been happening for the past two decades. However donkey meat is a delicacy in China. Initially there had been 200-250 donkeys in the area, but now the numbers have reduced to around 80-100. We sent a letter to the Department of Wildlife Conservation but were told that they are unprotected animals. We are also going to send a letter to the Divisional Secretariat urging them to probe the matter. When we were treating the animals the Police also came to check on us. Mannar is famous for its donkeys and they were brought from abroad for trading purposes,? said Weerasinghe.?
Weerasinghe added that four to five donkeys had wounds which were in rather bad conditions. ?These were animals that have escaped from the butcher?s knife. Their wounds had worms and have infected their brains,? she went on.?
?
In situ conservation is the best approach :?
Gunawardana?
?
?
?
Punishment could be imprisonment or a fine or both. When speaking about Delft ponies and donkeys in the Mannar Peninsula one could do either in situ or ex situ conservation
?
?
?
?
However the? Daily mirror??learned that the wild donkey is protected under Section 30 sub-section 1 of the Flora and Fauna Protection Ordinance. ?Therefore, killing, selling of flesh or any cruelty towards the animal are punishable offenses,? said environmental lawyer Jagath Gunawardana. ?Punishment could be imprisonment or a fine or both. When speaking about Delft ponies and donkeys in the Mannar Peninsula one could do either in situ or ex situ conservation. But I suggest that in situ conservation is the best approach which is to allocate a separate land in the same habitat. On the other hand ex situ is where they are removed from their original habitat and taken to another location and bred,? explained Gunawardana.?
?
?
?
Bridging Lanka :?
A haven for donkeys in Mannar?
?
As the donkey population faced serious threats to their survival, a team from Donkey Sanctuary India has visited Mannar to undertake an initial assessment of the condition of donkeys. With an aim to bring the large feral and abandoned donkey population in urban and rural areas back to health and prominence, Bridging Lanka, a non-governmental organization came into operation.?
Introducing the country?s first donkey-assisted therapy centre for differently-abled children including children with speech disabilities, the organisation is taking greater efforts towards the welfare of donkeys in the area. It also includes a donkey adoption programme, donkey relocation and welfare programme, volunteer animal care programme, school and community awareness campaigns and capacity building of veterinary staff.?
?
Sri Lankans have less equine knowledge:?
Jeremy Liyanage
?
?
?
Donkeys face threats due to various reasons. They are being killed for meat and because they damage crops and agriculture
?
?
?
?
?Bridging Lanka is very concerned about the diminishing donkey population in Kalpitiya,? said Jeremy Liyanage, Director of the Organisation. ?Donkeys face threats due to various reasons. They are being killed for meat, they are killed because they damage crops and agriculture, they die due to accidents on the road particularly because they are very invisible and there?s less lighting on the streets, they get wounded and there?s nobody to look after them and they feed on plastics and some of these materials don?t pass through their systems and they die a slow, painful death. Sri Lanka is a biodiversity hotspot and the local donkey populations haven?t had exposure to other donkey populations in the world. This makes them unique. Donkeys have shared the culture and traditions with people in Mannar for years. It is believed that a donkey?s breath has healing properties. There was one case when a small girl was brought to our therapy centre. The father said that she was very sick and had brought her to our centre as a last resort. A donkey spent half an hour breathing on the girl and there was a rapid recovery.? reminisced Liyanage.
?In addition, donkey milk is quite close to human milk,? Jeremy said, adding, ?It?s highly nutritious and is used in various parts of the world including Europe?.
According to Liyanage there are two types of donkeys in Kalpitiya; feral and wild. ?Feral populations were once domestic animals that are now wild. They have been exposed to urban settings. Wild donkeys on the other hand are found in remote parts in Kalpitiya that are healthy and are in good conditions. Hence they are a premium population,? he added.
Bridging Lanka conducts an extensive programme dedicated towards the welfare of donkeys. At the donkey-assisted therapy centre donkeys are being used as therapy to treat differently-abled children. The donkey clinic and community education centre is involved in treating many donkeys that are in bad shape. The donkey rescue teams go out every day and bring back injured donkeys for treatment.?
Liyanage further said that killing donkeys for meat is already happening in Mannar. ?They are being taken out of the district to coconut farms because the donkeys? dung keeps the coconut beetle away. But people in Sri Lanka have less equine knowledge and they don?t know how to look after the animals once taken out of their habitat. So they die after some time. Therefore it is important to spread awareness among the community as to why donkeys need to be protected. Any perpetrators should be arrested. People don?t have a positive attitude towards the donkeys and therefore they show cruelty towards the animal. I suggest that people could look at starting more services similar to ours and consider the well-being of these animals. After all it is important to have a safe place for donkeys in the current situation,? he added.
?
Kalpitiya DS denies donkeys are killed for meat?
When contacted, an official at the Kalpitiya Divisional Secretariat told the?Daily mirror? that it denies allegations about donkeys being killed and sold for meat. ?Kalpitiya has a 90% Muslim population and it is difficult to believe that they are killing donkeys for meat,? said Hajid, the Head of Management at the Kalpitiya DS. When asked about the wounds, he said that those wounds occur during the mating season when male donkeys fight with each other. ?Those wounds are rather brutal. In fact we have sent a team to Mannar and are working on setting up a conservation centre for donkeys which will also boost tourism in the area,? added Hajid.
?
?
The?Daily mirror? ?also spoke to the Kalpitiya Police who also said that they are not aware of such activities happening in the area.?

## Title: Political imbroglio could shelve efforts to have new constitution

Political imbroglio could shelve efforts to have new constitution
	
?
The on-going political and constitutional imbroglio in Sri Lanka could put on the back-burner, all discussion on giving the country a brand new constitution to take care of many pending issues, such as the powers of the Executive Presidency and the question of devolving power to the provinces, a core issue for the minority Tamils.??
According to Lal Wijenayaka, Chairman of the Public Representations Committee of the ?Constitutional Assembly? (which comprises all members of the present parliament), a draft of the new constitution had been prepared and distributed to all MPs in October.? ?
But it could not be taken up for discussion because of the political turmoil precipitated by the unceremonious and unexpected sacking of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe on October 26 by President Maithripala Sirisena.? ?
There is another question: In case the Supreme Court allows parliament to be dissolved, what happens to the draft new constitution prepared by committees appointed by the dissolved parliament? Will a new parliament have to start the process from scratch???
Wijenayaka said that the draft constitution was based on consensus on all issues except two: number 1, the question of keeping, or abolishing or diluting the Executive Presidency and number 2, electoral reform.? ?
?
In case the SC allows parliament to be dissolved, what happens to the draft new constitution prepared by committees appointed by the dissolved parliament? Will a new parliament have to start the process from scratch???
?
Apparently, there was consensus even on the touchy issue of power-sharing with the periphery, namely, the provinces. Perhaps this was why the United National Party (UNP) led by Ranil Wickremesinghe reportedly assured the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) that the draft constitution would be presented in parliament before February 2019.? On the now controversial 19th Amendment (19A),Wijenayaka said that the contents of 19A were not questioned at any stage because it had diluted the President?s powers and enhanced those of the Prime Minister and parliament by common consent and that too very recently.??
Contentious Issues
However, the Executive Presidency and the 19A have become extremely contentious now. These issues have brought the country to a standstill. Sri Lanka is now without a Prime Minister and a Council of Ministers, thanks to a Court of Appeal injunction. A Presidential gazette proclaiming parliament?s dissolution and the ordering of fresh elections has been stayed by the Supreme Court. Parliament may continue to exist or may be dissolved at any time. It will be for the Supreme Court to decide on this but there?s no knowing as to when it will pronounce its verdict. Sri Lankans are truly on tenterhooks.? ?
Given the nature of President Sirisena?s actions from October 26 onwards, the UNP seems to want a total abolition of the Executive Presidency in line with the Joint Opposition (JO)?s 2015 Presidential manifesto.? ?
The Tamil National Alliance (TNA), the Tamil Progressive Alliance (TPA) and the two major Muslim parties also want the Executive Presidency to go given its potential to turn Presidents into dictators and also its dismal record in solving the Tamil question.? ?
Suresh Premachandran of the Eelam Peoples? Revolutionary Liberation Front (EPRLF) says that though directly elected and sometimes elected with critical support from the Tamil population, Sri Lanka?s Executive Presidents have ignored the Tamils after getting elected. Therefore, the directly elected Executive Presidency has been of no use to the Tamils, he asserts.? ?
TNA spokesman M.A.Sumanthiran says that in a parliamentary system the Executive will need parliament?s support on a daily basis, and Tamil MPs can get multiple opportunities to play an influential role in shaping the decisions of the Executive. However, there are popular forces which are in favour of a strong Executive Presidency such as the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) led by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa.? ?
According to the SLPP and its allies, a strong Executive Presidency helps make quick decisions in a perpetually divided polity like Sri Lanka?s. It gives the Executive, the wherewithal to carry out rapid economic development and effectively meet threats to national security emanating from within the country and outside. SLPP members say that terrorists and separatists could not have been defeated and economic regeneration could not have taken place (between 2006 and 2014 end) but for an effective and powerful Executive President like Rajapaksa.?
?

The Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) led by President Sirisena is also in favour of retaining the Executive Presidency. It wants the 19A to be tweaked to give the Executive President the teeth he now lacks. Much of his power had been taken away by the Independent Commissions set up under the 19A.?
Some of the issues relating to the Executive President are now before a seven-judge bench of the Supreme Court and its verdict is eagerly awaited not only to get out of the present predicament but also to secure guidance on what could be done in regard to the draft constitution.? ?
A key issue before the court is whether the Presidential act of dissolving Parliament is justifiable. Related to this is the scope and nature of the legal immunity granted to the President when his actions are challenged in court. While it is agreed that a litigant can challenge the executive and administrative actions of the President, can he challenge a political action such as the dissolution of parliament? Is it not a prerogative of the President to summon, prorogue and dissolve parliament? How can dissolution of parliament accompanied with an order to hold fresh elections be seen as being ?undemocratic? when it recognizes the sovereignty of the people?? ?
The counter argument to this is that there is nothing anywhere in the constitution to suggest that the framers intended the President to have the freedom to act in violation of constitutionally entrenched clauses. The 19A had clearly set limits to Presidential power.??
Unbridled discretionary powers given to a President will only give rise to populism and misuse of power for aggrandizement. It will replace constitutionalism. The stability of States and political systems is critically dependent on constitutionalism. Mature democracies either circumscribe discretionary powers or do away with them altogether.??
Also, Sirisena?s act of dissolving parliament can be deemed a violation of the people?s will as expressed in the August 2015 parliamentary elections, even if fresh elections are ordered to secure a fresh mandate. The distinction between a political act and an administrative act has been made to prevent ?judicial overreach?. But in a case like the one facing Sri Lanka today, the political act of dissolving parliament can be seen as a violation of the constitution since it explicitly breaks specific articles of the constitution. No political act which violates the constitution can be condoned or kept out of the purview of the Supreme Court which is the final arbiter in constitutional matters.??
Admittedly, the drafting process of the 19A was chaotic. It was not debated in a cool and calm manner. It did not adhere to contemporary norms of transparency and public consultation. But ultimately, there was a consensus and a compromise.? ?
?
Sirisena?s act of dissolving parliament can be deemed a violation of the people?s will as expressed in the August 2015 parliamentary polls, even if fresh elections are ordered to secure a fresh mandate
The 19A neither took the Rajapaksa nor the Wickremesinghe line, the former wanting most Presidential powers retained, and the latter wanting as little of them as possible. The compromise came about when the Supreme Court insisted that any fundamental change in the 1978 constitution should be subjected to a two thirds majority as well as a referendum.??
But the nett result of all this is that Sri Lanka has neither an Executive Presidency nor a Westminster style parliamentary democracy. This has thrown the doors open to conflicts of the type it is facing now.

Ready for elections under a legitimate Govt. only Champika Ranawaka
	
Former Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka speaks about the current political crisis and its implications on the economy of the country. Excerpts:
QHow will the current political deadlock end in your view?
The deadlock was created by President Maithripala Sirisena and Mahinda Rajapaksa. The President can end this deadlock by giving the opportunity for the group commanding parliamentary majority in Parliament to form the government. The restraining order by the Court of Appeal affirmed actions taken by Parliament. That happened at a time when parliamentary actions were disputed by the other side saying that the Standing Orders were flouted and all.? ?
?
The President said he would not reappoint UNP leader Ranil Wickremesinghe even though all 225 MPs signed for him. It means this is no longer a constitutional matter. It is a question of personal ego and grudge.? ?
?This is not a question to be addressed according to one?s personal whims. This has to be resolved in accordance with the Constitution. Our allegation that the President flouts the Constitution is now affirmed.??
QWhat is the alternative for you now since the President declined to offer premiership to Mr. Wickremesinghe at any cost??
?We tried to resolve this problem. Now, the President is getting dragged into the problem. Whatever it is, the country is economically in ruins. It will have a four-percent impact on the Gross Domestic Production (GDP) next year. There will be a negative growth. The international lending rates will rise against us.? ?
First, what happened in Parliament is interpreted in different ways by various segments of society. The official Hansard report is out now. What transpired in Parliament on November 14, 15, 16 and 19 is correctly reported in it. Nobody can dispute it. The President, the MPs and the judiciary cannot disregard it.? ?
The Hansard says that the no-confidence motion was duly passed in accordance with the Standing Orders with 122 votes to zero. The following day, the Speaker announced his decision to Parliament. He announced that the government stood dissolved. The same motion was passed by the MPs once again on November 16.? ?
A majority of MPs stood for it despite brawls, mayhem and spraying of chilli powder. No one can dispute the removal of Mahinda Rajapaksa. He has already been ousted. There is no government now.??
Secondly, how can the President appoint a Prime Minister according to his whims? He has to accept the majority will of Parliament.? ?
QBut, the Constitution only says that the President appoints the person commanding majority support in his opinion only. How can you test his opinion as there is no provision for it?
The President should not take decisions in a piecemeal reference to the clauses of the Constitution. He has to look at the whole Constitution. Also, he should substantiate his opinion.? ?
Parliament showed clearly that the person, picked by him as the Prime Minister, did not command majority support. He has to appoint a new one now. It is not his personal opinion that matters. His personal opinion matters when he buys clothes, footwear, vehicles and so on. The appointment of the Prime Minister should be on a decision that can to be substantiated with facts on the ground.??
QYet, there is no methodology laid down in the Constitution to test the President?s opinion. Then, can?t he disregard what you say?
There is no way for him to hide behind. The President?s power to appoint the Prime Minister is interpreted in this manner by those without a proper understanding on constitutional matters. The President must be able to substantiate his opinion with facts on the ground. Otherwise, he cannot pick anyone as the Prime Minister according to his whims.? ?
QBut, what is the alternative if the President persists with his stand that Mr. Wickremesinghe cannot be appointed again?
Today, Parliament functions because of the Stay Order given by the Supreme Court. Parliament can take enough action against the President in such an eventuality. Parliament has vital functions, law making and control over public finance. The House can well use this authority against the President if the situation demands. We have already passed motions curtailing financial allocations to the Office of Prime Minister and the Cabinet.??
The President led the country down the path of absolute disaster. It caused a huge economic loss to the nation. Also, the country?s reputation was tarnished in the eyes of the international community. The President has lost legitimacy in the country.? ?
QWhat do you feel as an MP who worked for his election to office in 2015?
We did not work for the victory of an individual. Instead, we struggled for ending the family rule and democratic reforms. We achieved it to a certain extent. We could not achieve it fully. There is a political impact when the members of local bodies, the provincial councils and Parliament take place. The political impact of such crossovers cannot be likened to the impact of the President switching sides. When the President switches sides, the political impact is enormous. People scorn the President?s action today. They look at it with disdain and contempt. Also, people do not condone the use of muscle power by the Rajapaksa group to sabotage parliamentary sessions recently.? ?
This is nothing but fascism clothed in nationalism, patriotism and religiosity. We need a broad political formation to meet with this situation.?
?QHow far have you progressed in the formation of this front?
We talk about democracy in the country. It is equally important to have democracy within the parties. There should be a democratic, decision making framework. We have proposed a leadership council. We have also proposed council comprising professionals to take vital economic decisions instead of keeping it in the hands of a coterie of persons. We intend to introduce people oriented politics. Our brand name is people. The Rajapaksa family is the brand name of the other side, though.? ?
QDuring the last three and half years, the very same forces were in the government. We found a lot of policy contrasts. How can you correct them in the future?
There has to be elections under a legitimate government. There should be free and fair elections. The President has acted against the people?s mandate. We asked for the presidential elections. If it is all right, the parliamentary elections can also be conducted the same day.? ?
QA general election is possible only if the Supreme Court rules in favour of it. How are you planning for an election otherwise?
It can be done by passing a resolution with a two-thirds majority in Parliament. For that, a legitimate government has to be installed. The status quo that prevailed in the country before October 26 should be restored.??
QDoes it mean that UNP leader Ranil Wickremesinghe should be made the Prime Minister?
Let us decide whether he should be the Prime Minister or not. The President cannot decide it.??
QIn your personal view, who should be the Prime Minister?
This is not a question of appointing the Prime Minister. We are struggling with a huge debt burden.? ?
QWhen you form a broad political front, how do you reconcile these policy contrasts?
Along with democratic reforms, we need urgent economic reforms. A coterie of persons cannot do it. That is what happened during the past three and half years. We will form a council to handle the economic affairs. In addition to politicians, it will be handled by professionals. Then, we will have an economy not run by the family rule or a coterie of individuals.? ?
QHave you agreed on this council?
Yes, we have. That is what we are doing. We agreed basically on such a council, a leadership council and so on. We are ready for any election, but under a legitimate government as existed before October 26.

Sketches from history: Macaulay and Prinsep
	
?
In February 1835, the historian, politician, and imperialist Thomas B. Macaulay in a well received address known today as the Minute on Indian Education urged the then Governor General of India,William Bentwick, to reform secondary education in the country so as to deliver ?useful learning.? Colonial policy until then had been one of conciliation, of funding places of learning to promote native languages (especially Persian and Sanskrit). Ever since Warren Hastings?s term as Governor General, it had been recognised and taken for granted that to obtain the loyalty of the native subjects, it was necessary to make concessions to them.? ?
But by the time of Macaulay?s ascent in British India, Britain was undergoing a transformation. Macaulay belonged to the Whig faction of the Conservative Party, which stood for the interests of industrialists. Between 1815 and 1846, the campaign of these industrialists was the abolition of the Corn Laws. This pitted them against the traditional elite, the farmers. The Whigs, in their support of the industrialists over the aristocracy, espoused a utilitarian philosophy: they judged everything by its use, and whether it promoted the maximum happiness of the maximum number of people. Put simply, they measured everything in terms of returns and profits.? ?
Dickens would lampoon and ridicule the Utilitarian in Hard Times:?
A man of realities. A man of facts and calculations. A man who proceeds upon the principle that two and two are four, and nothing over, and who is not to be talked into allowing for anything over. With a rule and a pair of scales, and the multiplication table always in his pocket, sir, ready to weigh and measure any parcel of human nature, and tell you exactly what it comes to. It is a mere question of figures, a case of simple arithmetic.? ?
At the same time, Utilitarianism became the secular expression of an evangelical movement that found its footing in the heat and dust of India. As the authors of The Great Indian Education Debate put it, it was an alternative vision of the Empire that challenged the likes of Hastings, who had stood for a policy of conciliation and had stood behind the school referred to today as the Orientalism.? ?
The first person to openly challenge and spurn Hastings and the Orientalists was Charles Grant, who had served twice at the British East India Company (1768-1771 and 1774-1790) and who was a prominent member of the evangelical movement. In 1776, two years into his second tenure, he underwent a religious conversion that led him to oppose the upholding of Indian traditions. He enunciated his views in a book published in 1821, Observations on the State of Society among the Asiatic Subjects of Great Britain, which indicted the British for being no better than ?passive spectators? of the ?unnatural wickedness? in the faiths adhered to by Indians. The solution he proposed was simple: introduce the natives to Western learning.? ?
Translated to official policy, this meant educating the natives on what were perceived to be the significant and enlightened aspects of British rule, in particular the language of the ruler. As Macaulay stood in 1835 and delivered his verdict on this controversial issue, he made a remark that has been endlessly quoted since:? ?
We must at present do our best to form a class who may be interpreters between us and the millions whom we govern ? a class of persons Indian in blood and colour, but English in tastes, in opinions, in morals and in intellect. To that class we may leave it to refine the vernacular dialects of the country, to enrich those dialects with terms of science borrowed from the Western nomenclature, and to render them by degrees fit vehicles for conveying knowledge to the great mass of the population.? ?
There were two aspects to this new education policy, and they stemmed from his belief that subjects of colonial rule needed to be Anglicized. At the same time, he did not believe in Anglicizing every native. It was directed instead at a class of people who would be nurtured to ?be English? in everything but the colour of their skin, and who would convey Western ideas to the mass of the population. The teaching of English was one route through this class could be created; another route was Christianisation, though Macaulay stood for a policy of religious neutrality. (His contention was that abstaining from the conversion of native Indians did not mean expiating ?monstrous superstitions? such as the killing of goats.)? ?
How would this be ?useful?? Consider that until then, several institutions had been established by the British, at their cost, to educate the natives on their own languages. These included the Calcutta Madrasa, established in 1780; the Fort William College, established in 1800; and the Sanskrit College, established in 1824. Contrary to usual practice, students didn?t pay for their education; they were instead paid a stipend to learn the languages, and to this end, funds were allocated for the translation of key Sanskrit, Urdu, Hindi, Arabic, and Bengali texts to English.?
Macaulay?s argument, in keeping with the Utilitarianism in vogue in England at the time, was that this rebelled against basic principles of political economy. What people find useful, he reasoned, they would gladly pay for. Or in his words, ?What we spend on the Arabic and Sanskrit Colleges is not merely a dead loss to the cause of truth. It is bounty-money paid to raise up champions of error.?? ?
With such a point did he triumph against the Orientalist ?educationists?, the most prominent of whom, Henry Prinsep, defended the old policy on the basis that it was rooted in not just the South Asian tradition but the Western tradition as well. The Orientalist argument here was that Western seats of learning had been financed by grants which did not always generate returns. What Prinsep did not know, however, was that Macaulay had criticized the funding of such institutions on home soil: some years before, he had attacked the endowments which supported the study of Greek, Latin, and mathematics at Cambridge University.?
The tide, in any case, was against Prinsep.Macaulay won the debate; the Minute had vindicated him. The debate had been put in place to question the merits of the English Education Act of 1835. With Macaulay?s speech, the Act was quickly enforced, and the result, as historians have noted, was that vernacular education, while not stifled or deprived of funds, received little, if at all any, attention from the Company.? ?
The effect of this was to reduce British intervention in the education of the masses; schooling remained for decades the preserve of the elite, the class which Macaulay had baptized. How adversely this affected India can be gleaned by what Will Durant observed in his seminal work.? ?
The Case for India: There are now in India, 733,000 villages, and only 162,015 primary schools. Only 7% of the boys and 1.5% of girls receive schooling, i.e. 4% of the whole. Such schools as the Government has established are not free, but exact a tuition fee which, though small to a Western purse, looms large to a family always hovering on the edge of starvation.? ?
?
There were two aspects to this new education policy, and they stemmed from his belief that subjects of colonial rule needed to be Anglicized. At the same time, he did not believe in Anglicizing every native
It comes to no surprise that investments in education were severely lacking: The total expenditure for education in India is less than one-half the educational expenditure in New York State. In the quarter of a century between 1882 and 1907, while public schools were growing all over the world, the appropriation for education in British India increased by $2,000,000; in the same period appropriations for the fratricide army increased by $43,000,000.
Or in other words, at a time when the Government was spending 83 cents per head on its army, it was spending eight cents per head on education. As far as the Utilitarian-evangelical argument went then, the experiment was a failure; ?useful education? had, in the end, become a mere exercise in exploitation, poverty, and ignorance.? ?
What was even more significant was that this spread out to other parts of the Empire, most notably Sri Lanka. Six years before Macaulay made his speech, a Commission had been tasked with the object of proposing reforms. Among the recommendations made by this, the Colebrooke-Cameron Commission, were the abolition of the free compulsory scheme of labour known as rajakariya, the establishment of an Executive Council and Legislative Council (where members would be selected, not elected), the amalgamation of the Maritime and Kandyan provinces as a single administrative unit, and the admission of Ceylonese into the Civil Service. As Patrick Peebles has noted, while these recommendations were endorsed by the Governor, most of them ?were never implemented or weakened over time.?? ?
In one area, however, they were adhered to: the need for an education policy. That the Colombo Academy, the first public school in the country, was established in 1835, the same year in which the English Education Act was passed in India, couldn?t have been a coincidence. As I will make clear in the next essay, while the schools policy of the British in Ceylon was not exactly in concert with trends in colonial education policy in India, there were recurrent parallels between the two. When you consider that both Colebrooke and Cameron had been in British India, at the Company, and had come under the growing influence of the Utilitarians (or the ?Anglicists? as some call them) over the Orientalists, you will realize that in part at least, British education policy in Ceylon followed, if not imitated, the policy of the British Raj.?

SLSFTA?s effective date should be delayed: Bandula
	
The effective date of the Sri Lanka-Singapore Free Trade Agreement (SLSFTA) should be postponed to ensure the removal of any detrimental clauses, MP Bandula Gunawardana said today.
He said what they said about the SLSFTA had been proved correct by the experts committee in their report on the FTA. The report was handed over to President Maithripala Sirisena on Monday.
?The main problem with the FTA is as the President said, the FTA was rushed without the proper consent of stakeholder institutions. However, we are yet to study the report and the President assured us he would release it in two days,? the MP told a news briefing.
He said the Commerce Department was the institution which provided consultations when drafting FTAs but it has not been consulted by the previous International Trade Ministry because the department had been placed under the purview of the Commerce and Trade Ministry.
?The Commerce Department is refusing to take responsibility for the SLSFTA because it has not been consulted. Nine petitions were filed in Court against the FTA. Therefore, it is vital to remove any negative clauses,? the MP said.
He said he had submitted a Cabinet paper soon after he assumed duties as the new International Trade Minister seeking approval to hold bilateral negotiations to amend harmful clauses of the FTA before its effective date of January 21 next year.
?However, the Cabinet paper has been put on hold consequent to the Appeal Court suspending the ministers from functioning in their office. We are caught in a pickle now,? the MP said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Sri Lanka is now the  lonely planet
	
With all this chaos around us, my mind goes back to the late Dudley Senanayake
	Dr Colvin R de Silva, a constitutional wizard and a lawyer warned President Jayewardene, about bringing in the Executive Presidency
?
This remark was made recently by a Colombo wit at a recent function. The? political uncertainty caused by the constitutional coup? together with the disgraceful behaviour of lawmakers recently, has brought about? gloom and a sense of doom. Non recognition of the illegal Government internationally,which is clearly against the Constitution? has led to unprecedented tourist cancellations, stalling of aid, downgrading in the Fitch ratings and pull back of investment. How can those responsible for ruining our economy by playing ducks and drakes with our coffers with their rampant corruption, blatant show of extravagance, using public funds even for family memorials, now state that they and only they can manage the country and bring in good governance which they failed to do during their long tenure of office? White vans, disappearances and murders were a trade mark of their time, in steering the ship of state. When the underprivileged? are only able to buy chilly powder in minute quantities, they waste kilos of it by throwing it at opponents in Parliament,? and at the Speaker who stood his ground admirably and courageously, in spite of disrespect, threats, intimidation and disgraceful show of thuggery. There is no doubt that we have become a pariah state once again. The main speakers for the chief culprits in this ongoing catastrophic drama, are two who were not even elected by the people and failed to win their seats. Another who I expected better things from, is reported to have stated that they will take umbrage against those Governments who have brought a travel ban on Sri Lanka. Does he seriously think that the Governments of those democracies will care a hoot about these threats ??
?
Warnings of Dudley and Colvin?
With all this chaos around us, my mind goes back to the late Dudley Senanayake who stating his reasons for opposing? the executive Presidency,? many decades ago said ? The Presidential system would be disastrous?It would create a tradition of Caesarism. It would concentrate power in a leader and undermine Parliament and the structures of political parties?? Another great politician of the past,. Dr Colvin R de Silva, much respected like the late Dudley as a man, a politician, a constitutional wizard and a lawyer told the late President Jayewardene,? when he warned him about bringing in the Executive Presidency and the dire consequences of the wrong man in the role. We have seen this happen now and the words of these past two politicians, one from the right, one from the left, both gentlemen to their fingertips, having had the privilege of their upbringing and education, have come true. Political decisions which affect the country as a whole, should never be based on personal vendetta?s. Men in high office must think beyond? ?their own agendas and put the country first. They must also watch their words, think, get the words sorted out in their brains before they speak. In an media interview Mahinda Rajapaksa has stated thus? ? I was recently given a copy of a report published by an intergovernmental organization called the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance. The member states of this organisation include Germany,Australia,Canada, Switzerland. Also India and Japan. According to that report,there are only two countries that require a two thirds majority to dissolve Parliament.-Kosovo and Lithuania. However even in those countries, the head of state can dissolve Parliament if a no-confidence motion against the Government is adopted or if the statement of Government policy is rejected.? Sumit Bisarya from the Institute has issued a denial. He says, ?I Saw this in a Sri Lankan paper citing our work. This reference is completely out of context and I would like to add that there?s nothing in this primer or any of our resources, justifying discretionary, extra constitutional dissolution of Parliament.?Another individual, Milinda Rajapakse, said to speak for one of the Rajapakse brothers,? had stated thus? ?Thrilled to hear Shahidul my friend, well known human rights fighter and artist had been released from the jail? Shahidul from Bangladesh commented in reply ? Have we met before? Sad to see #couplk mar the democratic systems long upheld in Sri Lanka? Both these quotes speak for themselves.
?
The? political uncertainty has brought about? gloom
	White vans, disappearances and murders were a trade mark of their time, in steering the ship of state
	The Presidential system would be disastrous
	Men in high office must think beyond? ?their own agendas and put the country first
	We UNPers voted for Sirisena? wholeheartedly, because our Leader? Ranil Wickremesinghe requested us to do so
?
?
I admire the courage and the principles of the two young men who recently refused to accept an award from two so called Ministers of the unconstitutional cabinet. It is also heartening to find? that the judiciary has acted independently and for our ever vigilant, brave civil society, who are standing up for Democracy, for what is right and not who is right. We UNPers voted for and supported President Sirisena? wholeheartedly, at the Presidential election, because our Leader? Ranil Wickremesinghe requested us to do so. Many of us had not even heard of him. I had seen him just once when as the then Minister of Health he attended an event at the De Soysa Hospital which was built and donated to the nation by my great-grandfather, the late Charles Henry de Soysa. Later on, long after the elections,? ? when some UNPers criticised him, they were asked to refrain from doing so by our Leader. He supported him to the hilt and all along as Prime Minister worked for the unity in the Government. Despite differences of upbringing and education,? he stood by him, never hit back when he was hit and just turned the other cheek.?

His is an example for young politicians that one should never rant, rave and insult people, but keep one?s cool through all situations that one encounters in life. We are not Gods and have failings, but these in? Ranil?s case are mere human frailties. He may not pat you on the back with a ready smile, but one can be quite sure, that he will never stab you in the back? as many have done to him. In many such cases he has forgiven, forgotten and some have even been rewarded with.
? I have always had deep faith which has helped me through the storms in my own life, and I know that God Almighty will help us through and find a solution for this calamity which hit us like a bolt from the blue. For over one month the country has been in a state of limbo and surely those who are responsible for this situation must realize this. Or is to them something which they do? fail to comprehend through? sheer ignorance??

Tuk-tuk transport in addition to health care!
	
A coterie of henchmen of an upcountry politico well-known for his napping habit at public functions has taken over the full control of a medical institution in his area.? ?
?
These henchmen who account for most of the minor staff of this institution is reportedly taxing the outdoor and indoor patients for every odd job they perform for them though these jobs are part and parcel of their official duties.? ?
Most minor employees also function as tuk-tuk owner-drivers and the indoor patients are compelled to hire their vehicles to get back home when they are discharged on recovery.? ?
When an inhouse patient is discharged, a minor employee on duty would shed his uniform and offer him transport back home by his tuk-tuk. These tuk-tuks are taking up a major part of the space in the hospital premises, they say.? ?
The hospital authorities turn a blind eye to the activity of these minor employees fearing reprisals from the powerful politico responsible for appointing these employees.? ?

When the ?third eye? is absent in politics
	
?
Sirisena is more vulnerable than Rajapaksa was in 2015
?
The political impasse in the country has been described in many ways than one. The latest comes from president Maithripala Sirisena himself. Sirisena has said that though people want to relate the political stalemate to a clash between him and ousted premier Ranil Wickremesinghe, it is more to do with a battle between Western influenced thinking and national thinking.?
In other words the president implies that the West is influencing the unrest here, like in Syria. What the president says leaves us room to also think that the west doesn?t like him. This is apart from the West?s influence on the island given the geographical position it enjoys in the world map. True, the West has its ways of disrupting nations which do not fit in with their agendas. But what Sirisena fails to fathom is that the educated present generation doesn?t wish to be stifled and demands a proactive, liberal and a just leader. This may be too much of a package to ask for. But that?s exactly what Sirisena promised to offer when he was sworn in as president in 2015. But then, this man has changed!?
The present educated generation wants its country to adopt strategies of the West and for politicians to be honest and put country before self. This scenario goes without saying that the present generation would prefer to live in a Western country if the lawmakers of this island don?t move to the next level of thinking; a thinking that would make Sri Lanka an economically sound nation.?
If there is one good thing that came off the 2015 Presidential Elections it was the immerging of an era of peaceful protests. Despite sporadic violent incidents in the north, the country was rather peaceful. This thinking is of course applicable only to the period till the Yahapalana Regime was in power. But now the situation is changing and the peace has been disturbed. Very recently we saw some university students being tear gassed and chased away. Are these signs which suggest that anything which has a Rajapaksa flavour is ruthless and dictatorial?? ?
unable to ?walk the talk?
After being sworn in as prime minister, Rajapaksa took some decisions; which the public appreciated. He slashed petrol prices and gave tax concessions. Rajapaksa?s critics point out that all this is propaganda and was not done with patriotic thoughts in mind. The Sri Lankans labelled as those influenced by the West see these moves by Rajapaksa as suicidal. The country?s economy is in bad shape and needs both reduced spending and means of generating state income through taxes. The rich can be taxed in proportion to how they earn and the less affluent can be taxed without making their purses feel it.?
Former ousted prime minister Wickremesinghe talked much about restoring the country?s economy, but his rhetoric was confined to impressive speeches. The liberal-minded leader proved himself to be unable to ?walk the talk?.?
Wickremesinghe loves the West, travels there often and tries to implement their policies here. However, we must not forget that he also has the support of the Western nations. Wickremesinghe has reiterated the need to make Sri Lanka a knowledge-based highly competitive hub with a dynamic socio-market economy. But all these plans have been left with much to be desired.
It?s in this context that this writer wishes to remind that no outside country which is party to the FTA wishes to see constant regime changes and political turmoil in Sri Lanka; for that matter in any country. Thinking further on these lines, the West would prefer to have Wickremesinghe in the hot seat of Sri Lanka politics. This is because Wickremesinghe is termed ?well-educated? and welcomes? foreign investors where as Sirisena is skeptical of them.?
If Wickremesinghe?s idea is to give Sri Lanka prominence and importance in the world scene, Sirisena?s wish is to protect it from ?Western forces? which the president warns can be disruptive.?
Caught in this quagmire are its country?s citizens who are also divided on the role that Western nations can play in Sri Lanka. The outcry of the Western nations was negative towards Sri Lanka when the president prorogued parliament on November 9; largely because the government could not muster enough support within the parliament. President Sirisena recently said on television that things would not have worsened if the grieved parties had refrained from seeking the assistance of the law and opted instead for a negotiated settlement.?
But Sirisena?s newly acquired attitude is somewhat negative and doesn?t allow for the accommodating of the ideas of others. He sees all this mess created as the work of the West and rules out his thinking having had anything to do with it. He doesn?t see that his thinking was unconstitutional when he appointed Rajapaksa as Premier when the constitution states that the person who commands the highest confidence in Parliament must be appointed to this post. The majority of people have called for elections as the remedy to the problem, but Sirisena has ruled out snap elections.?
?
If Wickremesinghe?s idea is to give Sri Lanka prominence and importance in the world scene, Sirisena?s wish is to protect it from ?Western forces? which the president warns can be disruptive
We need not be surprised if Sirisena says that the Western world now wants to see the lawmakers impeach him. The majority who oppose Sirisena have minds of their own devoid of the western world and are mulling over the thoughts of impeaching him anyway. Sirisena must be remembered of an old saying- the enemy that destroys comes from within. A good example is Sirisena emerging from within the UPFA ranks and taking on his leader Mahinda Rajapaksa. The latter never expected this to happen at the 2015 presidential elections.?
Sirisena is more vulnerable than Rajapaksa was in 2015, as we are about to usher in 2019; an year lined up with at least two major elections. Compared to Rajapaksa, Sirisena is isolated and stands alone at this juncture.The West was annoyed with Rajapaksa because he is a dictator and also unhappy with him due to the manner in which he finished off the war. But still they would accept the fact that Rajapaksa is the more capable leader if a comparison has to be made between the two. As for Sirisena he has shown through his actions that the post of president was a little too hot for him to handle.

Women for Justice files Quo Warranto seeking to unseat Ranil
	
An organization identifying themselves as Women for Justice yesterday filed a petition in the Court of Appeal seeking a Quo Warranto order to unseat former Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe from his parliamentarian seat.
The organization's co-chairman Sharmila Gonawela told the media that Mr. Wickremesinghe?s membership in Parliament was illegal.
She claimed that while Mr. Wickremesinghe was functioning as a parliamentarian a company of his was involved in business with State organizations and institutions and as such he could not act as a parliamentarian.
She said therefore she sought the Court to declare that his membership in parliament was null and void. (T.Farook Thajudeen)
