Committee appointed to look into Edu. Sector political victimisation
	
A three-member investigation committee had been appointed by the Ministry of Public Administration and Management to look into the possibilities of providing relief to about 1, 000 education sector employees, who faced political victimisation during the recent past.
Sources said that following a meeting held on Friday (20), the committee headed by the Prime Ministers Coordinating Advisor for Public and Trade Unions Jinasena Dadallage and two officials of the Education Ministry was appointed to the task.
When contacted Mr. Dadallage said the committee was set up to revise the decision taken at the previous committees in this regard.
He said two committees had been set up for the task earlier.
According to the measures, the employees would receive promotions, compensations or salary increments.
Mr. Dadallage also said that according to the reports that a vast majority Government workers in the education sector had faced most political victimisation.
Meanwhile, speaking to the Daily Mirror, Ceylon Teachers Union (CTU) General Secretary Joseph Stalin said the move could be a violation of the Service Minute of the Education Sector.
He said they had filed a Fundamental Rights Petition last year under SCFR 164/2016 at the Supreme Court when the Government made its first attempt to grant relief to 2,400 education sector employees.
He said the Supreme Court, considering the FR, halted the move.
Mr. Stalin said the move was a violation of all three, the Education, Principal and Teachers Service and the Government was attempting to favour its supporters.
He also urged the Government to withdraw the committee appointed immediately or it would resort to stern trade union action. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

Dr. H.W. Jayawardene, QC: He was a great teacher
	
Twenty-eight years ago on the 19th April 1990 Dr. H.W. Jayawardene, QC, a colossus in the legal profession, passed away whilst on a visit to India. It was the end of an innings of a great legal luminary Sri Lanka had produced. It was a loss not only to his wife Claribel, son, daughters, in-laws and grandchildren, but to the legal fraternity at large. 
The late Dr. Jayawardene was an advocate par excellence and at the time of his death, had completed 49 successful years at the bar. Born to a family of lawyers, Dr. Jayawardene was conferred silk at an early age. Fame and success came to him within a short period, thanks to hard work. Civil law was his forte and the later years of his practice was dedicated to the appellate courts where he excelled in every case he appeared in. The law reports of Sri Lanka and England bear ample testimony to his brilliance. 

The legal fraternity of Sri Lanka owes a deep gratitude to Dr. Jayawardene for his contribution to the legal profession in many ways. When the Bar Association of Sri Lanka came into being in 1975, he was its first President. When there was a move by the then Government to shift the courts from Hulftsdorph to Bambalapitiya, it was Dr. Jayawardene who steered the opposition with success. He was instrumental in getting the Government of China to construct the Superior Courts Complex in Hulftsdorph which to-date houses the several appellate courts, the Supreme Courts, including the ceremonial Supreme Court, the judges chambers, the Ministry of Justice etc. Even the trees that stand in the said superior courts complex were planted under the strict stewardship of Dr. Jayawardene. Many others in his position would have wished to get their names inscribed in a prominent place in the Court Complex for posterity, but not Dr. Jayawardene QC who was a true leader of the Bar. 

Dr. Jayawardene was a keen student of the law and a great teacher who was always willing to share his knowledge with fellow members of the profession. The large number of lawyers who learned the intricacies of the law in the chambers of Dr.Jayawardene QC include judges, politicians, senior practitioners, Presidents Counsel and several others. The high calibre advocacy, meticulous chamber work and academic approach to any legal issue are some of the valuable lessons Dr. Jayawardene imparted to juniors under his wing. When I started my career as a lawyer at his chambers we were well aware of the hard work put in by Dr. Jayawardene to serve his clients. There are several cases where he worked pro-deo. Dr. Jayawardene enjoyed working with his juniors in chambers and in courts and ensured that they were well equipped to be exemplary in the profession. I am happy to note that Dr. Jayewardenes grand-daughter Shahila Wijewardena, a law graduate from England who completed her Attorneys in Sri Lanka and apprenticed in my chambers, is now a busy practitioner in the chambers of Harsha Amarasekara PC and is following in her grandfathers footsteps. Coincidentally Amarasekara PC and I were the last two juniors of Dr. H.W. Jayawardene QC Chambers. 

The other contributions made by Dr. Jayawardene to the country were not limited to the legal field. He held several important posts in the public and private sector including the post of Chairman of the Sri Lanka Foundation. He also led the team that participated in the Thimpu Talks in order to reconcile the burning issue of terrorism at that time. He was a perfectionist and his achievements were far too many to mention in an appreciation. A few years ago the Bar Association of Sri Lanka named its main Auditorium in Hulftsdorph as the Dr. H.W. Jayawardene QC Auditorium, which was a fitting tribute for his services to the legal profession. 
He was a true Buddhist who followed the precepts of Gautama Buddha. He practised his religion in a quiet way. Dr. Jayawardene was a devoted husband and a wonderful father. It is said that writers leave behind their books and teachers leave behind their students. Dr. H.W. Jayawardene QC was a largehearted man and a great guru to several in the legal profession. 

May he attain Nirvana.

Min. Musthapha against removing unauthorized buildings in Mirissa
	
Minister of Provincial Councils and Local Government Faiszer Musthapha today opposed the Coastal Conservation Departments decision to remove unauthorized constructions along the coastal belt in Mirissa by May 1.
He explained that the decision made by the Coastal Conservation Department Director Prabath Chandrakeerthi was an arbitrary one.
Minister Musthapha said the Department could remove any illegal construction in the coastal belt, however, if the motive is hamper the livelihood of small entrepreneurs, he is against the move.
Minister further explained that the tourism industry is dominating the service sector in and around the Mirissa area, as such the removal of such places would lead to many unemployment issues among the area residents.
Minister said that it was not the unity Governments principal to let down the small entrepreneurs, therefore he will advise the authorities to consider the grievances of the masses before reaching any harsh decisions.
Minister Musthapha had reportedly discussed the matter with the small entrepreneurs in Mirissa on Friday (20).

Never get carried away with NCM victory - Sajith
	
One should not get carried away with the defeat of the No-Confidence Motion but should co-concentrate on the Presidential and General Elections in 2020, Minister of Housing Sajith Premadasa said over the weekend.
Mr. Premasada made this sentiment at the opening of Siyanethugama village for the blind on Saturday.
We were able to win the No-Confidence Motion. However, we should all remember that we have only managed to win the confidence of the majority from 225 members in Parliament. We should be able to win the confidence of 20 million people of this country.
One must not think that the Opposition is finished for good. We will be digging our own grave (Illang Kanawa) if we think that way, Mr. Premadasa said.
He said the Opposition learnt its lesson when the No-Confidence Motion against the Prime Minister was passed. However, we have won a great battle by defeating it.
The minister pledged to create 2,500 reawakened villages by 2020.
The village reawakening programme that had been started by this government would have died if the no faith motion against the Prime Minister was passed on April 4, 2018, he added. (Yohan Perera)

Suicide bomber strikes in Afghan capital, 31 killed
	
A suicide bomber struck a voter registration center in the Afghan capital on Sunday, killing at least 31 people, officials said.
Public Health Ministry spokesman Wahid Majro said another 54 people were wounded in Sundays attack, updating an earlier toll. Gen. Daud Amin, the Kabul police chief, said the suicide bomber targeted civilians who had gathered to receive national identification cards.
The large explosion echoed across the city, shattering windows miles away from the attack site and damaging several nearby vehicles. Police blocked all roads to the blast site, with only ambulances allowed in. Local TV stations broadcast live footage of hundreds of distraught people gathered at nearby hospitals seeking word about loved ones.
The Taliban, who usually claim their attacks, denied involvement. That means the bombing was likely carried out by a local Islamic State affiliate, which has been behind past bombings in Kabul that targeted civilians. Both groups are opposed to democratic elections.
Afghanistan will hold parliamentary elections in October. Last week, three police officers responsible for guarding voter registration centers in two Afghan provinces were killed by militants, according to authorities.
Elsewhere in Afghanistan, a district police chief in the northern Balkh province died of his wounds after being shot Saturday during a gunbattle with insurgents, according to Sher Jan Durrani, spokesman for the provincial police chief in Balkh. He said around a dozen insurgents were also killed in the battle, which is still underway.
Durrani identified the slain commander as Halim Khanjar, police chief for the Char Bolak district. The Taliban claimed responsibility for the killing. (The Indian Express)

Worlds oldest person dies in Japan at age of 117
	
The great-great-great-grandmother regarded as the world's oldest person has died in Japan at the age of 117.
An official in the southern Japanese town of Kikai said Nabi Tajima died in a hospital on Saturday night. She had been there since January.
Ms Tajima was born on August 4, 1900, and reportedly had more than 160 descendants, including great-great-great grandchildren.
Her town of Kikai is in Kagoshima prefecture on Kyushu, the southernmost of Japan's four main islands.
She became the world's oldest person seven months ago after the death of Violet Brown in Jamaica, also at the age of 117.
Guinness World Records certified 112-year-old Masazo Nonaka of northern Japan as the world's oldest man earlier this month, and was planning to recognise Ms Tajima as the world's oldest person.
The US-based Gerontology Research Group said another Japanese woman, Chiyo Yoshida, was now the world's oldest person in its records. She is due to turn 117 in 10 days.
Ms Tajima's death comes three days after the death of Celino Villanueva Jaramillo, who claimed he was 121 years old.
Mr Jaramillo's ID card stated he was born on July 25, 1896, but he was not recognised as the world's oldest person by Guinness due to a lack of official documentation.
The Chilean lost his birth certificate in a fire that burned his house down 20 years prior.(ABC)
