Bandu and Bindu asked to settle among themselves
	
The Colombo Chief Magistrate today invited the two parties to arrive at a settlement over the inquiry against Bindu Bothalegama, who is alleged to have violated the performing rights of the complainant, veteran actor Bandu Samarasinghe.
The Magistrate also directed Mr. Bothalegama to provide a statement to the CCD about the other parties who were allegedly involved in guiding him to imitate the veteran actor and had published DVD films.
Senior counsel Amarasinghe appearing for the complainant told the Magistrate that his client did not want to see Mr. Bothalegama swept off from the industry but in the first place should have obtained Mr. Samarasinghe's permission before indulging in such activities.
He said his client was concerned about the others involved in this matter by producing films using Mr. Bothalegama and to earn money in an improper manner.
Counsel also sought court to direct the CCD to produce them in Court on the next date.
The defence counsel said his client regretted his failure to ask permission from the complainant but that his client had not violated the complainant?s performing rights. He said his client was prepared to apologise to the complainant for for any inconvenience or embarrassment caused.
Mr. Samarasinghe complained to the CCD saying his performing rights had been infringed upon by Mr. Bothalegama violating the clause 17 (1) of the Intellectual Property Act.
The Magistrate put off the case for April 25. (Shehan Chamika Silva)

Chief Executive Officer of the Bodu Bala Sena (BBS) Dilantha Withanage today urged the Government that it had come to know about the warning of the danger of the Islamic State terror group spreading its tentacles to South Asia, from a recent report by the UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon.
While addressing a media briefing today, he said the report had been handed over to the Defense Ministry last week.
The report warned about the spreading of the Islamic State terror groups in the country.
?We are questioning the President?s office and the Prime Minister?s office about the knowing of this report,? Mr. Withanage said.
?Foreign Minister Mangala Samaraweera might not have read this report,? he said.
?In his report the UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon had warned the danger of the IS terror group spreading its tentacles to South Asia including Sri Lanka through organisations. The report demonstrates the speed and scale at which the threat has evolved in just 18 months,? he said.
?We should talk about this threat in terms of politics rather than looking at it in a racial manner as we are raising the issue.
?Due to lax visa regulations, Sri Lanka is fast becoming a hotspot for terrorist activities for them to spread fear among our people,? he said.
?If the government had a backbone, it should stop the spreading of the Islamic State terror group in the country instead of hunting BBS,? he said. (Chaturanga Pradeep)

Google "Project Loon" balloon enters SL for Internet tests
	
Google's balloon-powered high-speed Internet service known as "Project Loon" began its first tests in Sri Lanka Monday ahead of a planned joint venture with Colombo, the country's top IT official said.
One of three balloons that will be used in the trials entered Sri Lankan airspace Monday, the Information and Communication Technology Agency chief Muhunthan Canagey said.
"The first balloon entered our airspace this morning. It was launched from South America." Canagey told AFP. "It is currently over southern Sri Lanka."
He said a Google team was expected later this week to test flight controls, spectrum efficiency and other technical matters.
The government announced earlier this month it would take a 25 percent stake in a joint venture with Google to deliver a high-speed Internet service powered by helium-filled balloons.
Sri Lanka is not investing any capital, but will take the stake in return for allocating spectrum for the project. A further 10 percent of the joint venture would be offered to existing telephone service providers on the island.
It promises to extend coverage and cheaper rates for data services.
Service providers will be able to access higher speeds and improve the quality of their existing service once the balloon project is up and running.
The balloons, once in the stratosphere, will be twice as high as commercial airliners and barely visible to the naked eye. The balloons will have a lifespan of about 180 days, but can be recycled, according to Sri Lankan officials involved in the venture.
Official figures show there are 3.3 million mobile Internet connections and 630,000 fixed line Internet subscribers among Sri Lanka's more than 20 million population.
Sri Lanka became the first country in South Asia to introduce mobile phones in 1989 and the first to roll out a 3G network in 2004. It was also the first in the region to unveil a 4G network two years ago. (Source: Daily mail)

The National Freedom Front (NFF) said today media freedom was under siege brought about by the several threats being made by the current government.
Parliamentarian Jayantha Samaweera told a media conference that Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe had made strong statements against the media.
?When this government assumed office it claimed that it will assure media freedom, but what?s happening now is quite different. It has accused journalists and reporters in public and described them in demeaning terms. When we consider Sanka Amarajith?s case it is clear that this government is again moving towards what happened to Richard De Zoysa. Why is President Maithripala Sirisena remaining silent in the midst of these controversies,? he said.
Mr. Samaraweera claimed that the Task Force for Reconciliation (TFR) set up by the Prime Minister was bound to lead the country towards the division of the country. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)

NDB 4Q up 46% to Rs.1.25bn over higher loans; but full year profit down 14%
	
National Development Bank PLC (NDB) increased its group net profit by as much as 46.5 percent to Rs.1.25 billion for the quarter ended December 31, 2015 (4Q15) over the corresponding period in 2014, amid accelerated credit demand seen in the latter part of the year, the interim results showed. The earnings per share (EPS) rose to Rs.7.62 from Rs.5.68 a year ago.
The NDB share closed Rs.1.30 or 0.77 percent lower at Rs.168.50 last Friday. The return on equity declined to 12.59 percent from 15.78 percent in 2014. The net profit at the bank level was Rs.848.6 million for the quarter, up 41.3 percent yoy.
The net interest income (NII) for the group rose by 7.7 percent to Rs.2.1 billion but the bank?s net interest margin (NIMs) declined to 2.63 percent from 3.31 percent a year ago, ?largely due to the less than favourable interest rates that prevailed in the market,? NDB said in an earnings release. The interest rates are now on the rise but the banking sector analysts opine the NIMs could come further under pressure in 2016 if the banks carry larger fixed rate corporate loans in their books.
On the contrary, higher interest rates offer much leeway for banks to maintain higher margins, the empirical evidence show. NDB has revised its revenue recognition criteria where the bank has discontinued the recognition of interest income of loan facilities if the arrears position is equal or more than three installments with effect from July 01, 2015. Meanwhile the non-fund based incomes grew by 17.5 percent to Rs.1.58 billion.
This demonstrates the group?s concerted efforts aimed at growing fee-based income to cushion the profits during challenging times.
The bank saw its gross loans and advances rising by as much as 19.3 percent or Rs.34.8 billion during the year which pushed the bank to surpass the Rs.300 billion asset base to close the year with a Rs.309.2 billion balance sheet. The bank?s balance sheet growth was 18 percent or Rs.46.5 billion in 2015 while the group now has an asset base of Rs.315.4 billion, up 17 percent. During the year, consumer loans grew Rs.4.7 billion to Rs.23.6 billion,
lease portfolio virtually doubled to Rs.16 billion from Rs.8.9 billion while the housing loans grew Rs.1.9 billion to Rs.8.3 billion, reflecting the consumption credit boom in 2015. The bank?s exposure to leases rose from 4.9 percent to 7.4 percent from the total gross loans and receivables. The growth in the lending book was almost entirely funded by the deposits which grew 21.8 percent or Rs.33.1 billion to Rs.184.9 billion.
The bank however raised Rs.10 billion via senior listed debentures in June 2015. Available for sale financial investments rose by Rs.11.5 billion. Meanwhile, the bank?s low cost deposit base?current and savings account (CASA) ratio? slightly improved from 24 percent to 25.6 percent during the year. This is much below the industry average which hovers close to 40 percent levels. Higher CASA leads to higher margin as the cost of funds becomes lower. The local banks are now offering highly attractive rates to lure customer deposits as the funds for lending is limited after the Central Bank mopped up excess liquidity through a higher reserve ratio in January 2016. NDB?s provisions for possible bad loans and other losses declined by 9.8 percent to Rs.201.2 million, predominantly due to much lower collective impairments reflected through the improvement in the quality of the assets. The gross non-performing loan ratio edged down from 2.51 percent to 2.43 percent, well below the industry average. The efficiency as reflected by the, ?cost to income ratio (CIR) was 49.55 percent. Despite the year-on-year increase in the CIR, predominantly attributable to network expansion costs, the CIR of the bank was well managed within the industry norms,? the statement said. The bank, operating with 93 branches and 1,960 employees, saw the branch network going up by 10 new branches and 216 employees during the year. Meanwhile, for the year ended December 31, 2015 the banking group posted a net profit of Rs.3.54 billion (EPS of Rs.21.51), down 14 percent. On a standalone basis the bank?s net profit grew only 3 percent to Rs.3.5 billion. The lower profit was due to NII, which edged down by 1 percent to Rs.7.8 billion, net gains from financial investments, which fell by 61 percent to Rs.494 million due to marked-tomarket losses, higher individual impairments, which rose by 297 percent to Rs.561.2 million and higher operating costs. Other operating income grew by as much as 127 percent to Rs.744.9 million due to, ?the higher exchange gains earned on the revaluation of the foreign currency book of the bank over the prior year, which resulted from the adoption of a free float foreign exchange rate mechanism in September 2015,? NDB said. The Tier I capital adequacy ratio (CAR) of the bank declined to 8.51 percent while the Tier II CAR fell to 12.59 percent from 10.09 percent and 14.68 percent a year ago due to the expansion in risk weighted assets/loans. As a part of the shareholder agreement between NDB Capital Holdings PLC and NDB Zephyr Partners Ltd on December 15, 2014, the former invested Rs.49.6 million in 60 percent ordinary shares and redeemable preference shares of the latter on January 2, 2016 which is not accounted for in the financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2015. As of December 31, 2015, Bank of Ceylon held 9.91 percent stake in NDB followed by the state controlled private sector pension fund, Employees? Provident Fund with 9.69 percent and Sri Lanka Insurance Corporations? General Fund with a 5.68 percent stake.

Parliamentary Oversight Committees: Powers to summon CMs, pro. ministers
	
Parliamentary Oversight Committees, which are to be established shortly, will have the power to summon chief ministers and the provincial ministers whenever necessary, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said today.
At a workshop to educate MPs on the proposed Oversight Committees, the Prime Minister said giving wide powers to the oversight committees including the power to summon chief ministers and provincial ministers would help ensure that public funds are used effectively at all levels of governance.
He said Parliament which currently carries out an activity similar to a postmortem examination would be given wide powers through the setting up of oversight committees. ?Parliamentarians perform postmortems, because some of the legislation or regulations are discussed in the House only after they are implemented. However with the new committee system the MPs will be able to discuss Bills, regulations and resolutions before they are approved,? the Prime Minister said adding that oversight committee chairpersons would have powers similar to cabinet ministers.
He expressed his sadness at the absence of ministers at the workshop and said it would have been possible to get some feedback from the vast experience they had on establishing oversight committees had they attended it. (Yohan Perera)

The Government Medical Officers? Association (GMOA) today claimed that the CID had received several telephone calls from the Prime Minister?s Office pressuring the CID to speed up investigations against the GMOA.
GMOA Spokesman Dr. Navin de Soysa said the doctor, on whose complaint the CID initiated investigations had previously been a GMOA member and a strong supporter of a very powerful minister in the present Yahapalanaya government.
He said GMOA members were being questioned by the government in an attempt to silence them over a typographical error in a booklet published by the GMOA in 2012 regarding the setting up of a specialists' registry and the introduction of an evaluation procedure for foreign medical specialists due to the spate of 'unqualified' Indian doctors practicing in private hospitals.
The GMOA?s General Committee has decided to go ahead with the countrywide strike action unless the government took action to stop the CID from summoning its members.
?As far as we are concerned, this is not a matter for the CID. We did not think our CID was that jobless to carry out investigation into some printing mistake of an old booklet. This book was launched under the direction of the ministry of health in 2012. In future we may have to send the proofs to the CID to check for any printing mistakes,? Dr. de Soysa said.
He said the GMOA would not be discouraged by the summoning of its members or filing lawsuits against it when they point out the misdeeds in the Heath Sector. (Piyumi Fonseka)
