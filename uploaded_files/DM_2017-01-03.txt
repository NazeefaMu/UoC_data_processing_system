Development (Special Provisions) Bill: We want economic development and rapid decision making
	
Deputy Minister of State Enterprise Development Eran Wickramaratne, in an interview with the Daily Mirror, speaks about the current status of economy, proposed Development (Special Provisions) Bill and plans to lease out Hambantota Port to China Excerpts:
	As for Hambantota Port lease, we have only signed the framework agreement. Negotiations are not yet completed
	
	
	The bill is trying to resolve an issue
	
	
	In Hambantota, you have to invest on a container terminal
	
	
	Businesses never invest for 100 years; only geopolitics invests for 100 years
	

How do you observe the current political situation
It has to be analyzed in reference to the change in 2015. It was basically a change from a particular way of governing to a democratic way. That is not a change solely done by politicians. The society also did it. Its demands and expectations are much higher. There is a higher call for democratic norms, consultations. Now democracy has been strengthened. The rule of law is there. Media freedom has been restored. What we had overcome is that nobody, even in the future, would be able to govern this country outside the rule of law and basically the democratic framework. That is the big shift that happened. Personalities are secondary. Today, President Maithripala Sirisena cannot have his way, and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe his way. The successor of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa in his party also cannot have his way.
We have fallen short of expectations in two areas. One area is that the wheels of justice have not moved as fast as they should have. There are lots of investigations. Yet, they have not moved to conclusions. In Sri Lanka, cases have been dragged on for years. It has been a very inefficient court system. My concern is that people are losing confidence in the system because of the delays involved. When there are delays, fingers are directed at two directions. One is towards politicians and the second at the judiciary itself. I will go further. Capacity for investigation is low here. In a way, no serious financial crime has led to any conviction in the last 30 years. To speed up investigations into financial crimes, there has to be a dedicated court. I have been calling for this for some time. Giving excuses citing lack of resources is unacceptable. The public are demanding it. The public say something has to be done.
What is the second area where the government has failed
The second area where the government has fallen is job creation. I think the economy has done reasonably well given that the global economic growth has slowed. The new government inherited two deficits- Budget Deficit and Current Account Deficit. We inherited huge debts. The governments income level is extremely low. The first priority is to stabilize that economic situation. The second is to see that investment grows.
There was very little Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) during the previous period. But, that government had a large public investment programme funded by large debts taken at very high interest rates. The new government cannot pursue the same policy for the obvious reason that it can lead to a bigger crisis.

"There are different levels of frauds. As you said, the ones taken to local courts are regarding cases involving small amounts. Crime is a crime anyway. When you go to a court, you have to produce evidence to get conviction. They take to court the case where they think there is evidence. You can say there are very large scale corruptions."


The Finance Minister has been trying basically to stabilize the economy during the last two years. For us to grow, we need to have FDI. In 2017, there are challenges. First we need to have a short term programme, may be targeting 2020. Or we need to have a middle term programme. In the short term, it is to see how to improve the FDI rate from one billion dollar range to four to five billion dollar range. You have to foresee in the light of changes that are happening around the world and Donald Trump becoming the President of the United States. To do that, the government has engaged two tier strategies. One is to improve our doing business environment, and secondly to direct negotiations to get FDIs.
One good example is the port. You have an infrastructure which is a white elephant. The government has two options. One is to shut it down as a white elephant. The second is to make marginal profit out of it. Then, you need to get equity into the project. That is the discussion that is on at present.
In your answer, you referred to these prosecution and investigation processes. Before the election, you talked about multi-billion dollar frauds. The government leaders talked about billions of dollars stashed elsewhere in the world. But, we see investigations only into financial irregularities, which are small in nature. What has happened actually
There are different levels of frauds. As you said, the ones taken to local courts are regarding cases involving small amounts. Crime is a crime anyway. When you go to a court, you have to produce evidence to get conviction. They take to court the case where they think there is evidence. You can say there are very large scale corruptions.
For example, knowing that there is reasonable evidence regarding aircraft purchases for the national carrier at that time, there is a gap in determining who actually did the transaction and whose balances benefited from it.
The gap is the investigation part. Forensic investigation is needed. The other issue is that transactions of this nature cut across the international boundaries. Therefore, local jurisdiction is limited. Then, you need international investigation. You need lawyers familiar with international laws. Then, you come up with banking secrecy laws of other jurisdiction, which are quite strict. If we continue to systematically investigate these transactions, we will probably find evidence. But, it is going to take probably ten years. Financial crimes of international nature take time to be investigated. Why they are pursuing the local ones is due to ability to provide evidence.
I would like to refer to the case of TNA MP N. Raviraj. It is the widely held belief that he was assassinated. The authorities have a lot to answer about that assassination. I met him only once. That was on the night of the Presidential Election of 2005.

"We have agreed not to sell national assets, but to lease. The debate is now on the lease period"

We were about to attend a TV programme. I was a banker then. I was invited for analysis. We got to know each other on that. He said it was the saddest day. I asked why. He said Mr. Ranil Wickremesinghe was going to lose.
Then, I inquired as to how he knew because the elections results were only coming up at that moment. He said Mr. Wickremesinghe was to lose because the Tamil people did not vote. He said all the TNA MPs at that time were summoned to Kilinochchi by the LTTE. They had a couple of meetings. At the last meeting chaired by S. P. Tamilselvan, he said he, and some others, argued that Tamils should be allowed to vote. After a while, he said S. P. Tamilselvan took a letter out and read it. It had been a letter sent by Veluppillai Prabhakaran.
The decision had already been taken. This was told to me personally. I was shocked. Now, Raviraj has been eliminated in a High Security Zone. I do not want to comment on the court proceedings. But, somebody killed Raviraj. A moderate Tamil politician was killed. There are lots of unanswered questions.
In pursuing corruption, we know there has been corruption on large scales. The question is how long it will take to bring people to justice.
There is the allegation that the law enforcement arms do not take action against corruption involving those in the government, more so regarding the Central Bank bond scam. What are your views
The Parliamentary process on the bond scam ended only a few months ago. One important thing is that there is reasonable evidence to investigate the brokering company.
The second thing is that the former governor and his officials in the Central Bank are responsible for the situation that has arisen. All the members of the Committee of Public Enterprises (COPE) have agreed to this conclusion. There have been debates on technicalities. That is a conclusion we were coming to when the last COPE was dissolved.
The unfortunate part, in my view, is that Parliament took so long to come to that conclusion. That is the unfortunate part of it. Now the step is that Parliament will debate it.
I hope the report will be debated in January.
The second thing is that Parliament, by resolution, should investigate. Parliament should turn over investigations to investigative arms of the government. The MPs are not well versed in doing that no. The report has been referred to the Attorney General. The Attorney General should study and take it to the next level. If it needs judicial inquiry, the Attorney General should move. Now, you asked a question about an inbuilt doubt whether the government would not be keen on prosecuting it because people called into question were the ones appointed by the government. Given that the doubt exists, it is my view that Parliament should take the initiative basically in pursuing the COPE report and seeing that it is properly investigated. Based on that, prosecution should happen. Parliament means the Speaker who could actually summon the Attorney General and proceed on. We should do it.
There is a hue and cry in the country. There is a COPE Report and Parliament will debate it. If there is reasonable evidence, then it should be investigated.
You talked about stabilization of economy and the need for job creation. For that, you need to attract FDI, to sign Free Trade Agreements and strengthen laws here. But, the government has failed to do any of these during the last couple years. Why is it
If you look at the kinds of initiatives that had a push-back, I do not say there is a public push-back in the FTAs. I would say that obviously interested parties are making a political issue out of FTAs. The best examples are the situations of Sri Lanka and Vietnam in 1995.
I went there at that time. We were, more or less, in the same range of exports. What mattered most were the markets opened to them and Sri Lanka based on trading arrangements.
Vietnam was also a very important partner of the Trans Pacific Partnership Agreement (TPP), which the US President elect calls into question. But, Vietnam has benefited from it. Sri Lanka went from 2.5 billion dollar exports to Rs. 10 billion US dollars.
However, Vietnam went up to US $ 165 billion or US $ 170 billion. The world has moved into trading partnerships and agreements.
Like in every agreement, there are pluses and minuses. If you look at the FTA between Sri Lanka and India, trade has zoomed. Critics only analyze the bilateral trade volume.
But, actually, trade volume through the FTA should be analyzed here. Actually, 90- percent of Sri Lankas exports to India take place through the provisions of the FTA.
But, Indian exports to Sri Lanka are mostly outside the FTA. Even if we did not have the FTA, India would have exported to Sri Lanka more and more. We have to trade with the rest of the world. According to inscriptional evidence, Sri Lankas kings had sent ambassador even to European countries in ancient times.
Sri Lanka had been intertwined with the rest of the world. If you look at it from a strategic point of view, in 1910, Sri Lanka had the second biggest harbour in Asia, only next to Hong Kong. Still Sri Lanka is in the world. Now we are in the first 30 or something. Sri Lanka, even today, has a harbour virtually larger than any in Europe.
Only Amsterdam is slightly bigger. Sri Lanka has a market of 20 million and India 1.2 billion. If we access 200 million of it, we will become a small country next to the US, or a country like Hong Kong to China. There is a fear factor about the FTA. It is understandable. We need to look at it from an enlightened way. Discussions should be transparent.
When it comes to the Hambantota port, it is anyway a white elephant.
Actually, the need for a port in Hambantota has been highlighted for a long time. During the 2002/2004 UNP government, you planned for it. How do you look at the economic logic of it then
Viability of any project is found out. We have to argue that, in Hambantota, there is a basic financial logic to profit from the maritime movements down Hambantota. For the naked eye, you can see 200 vessels passing Hambantota for a day. That kind of traffic is there. The question is how one should tap it. That is to provide services to ships. There is a basic logic there. Then, you build into the next level of investment.
The Colombo Port has always been profitable. The international airport in Hambantota is questionable. Whether we can do some things about it is a possibility. You invest for returns. You never invest for 100 years. Businesses never invest for 100 years. Only geopolitics invests for 100 years. I am very concerned about. I never compromise on geopolitics. In Hambantota, you have to invest in a container terminal.
China is a world super power today. It is now going to own a port in Sri Lanka. How will it affect the balance of power playing out in the Indian Ocean region
We have to look at it in a balanced view. In the Colombo Port, there are three terminals. The first terminal is owned by us. As for the second terminal, 15 percent is owned by the Sri Lanka Ports Authority and the rest private sector operation.
It is not unusual for us to have minority ownership. We already have it. The nice thing about the Colombo port is this. There is competition. As for Hambantota, we have only signed the framework agreement. Negotiations are not yet complete. We have negotiated up to 20 percent. The request is to give it on a 99-year lease.
We have agreed not to sell national assets, but to lease. The debate is now on the lease period. Judging by the comments in media, the President has appointed someone.
As for geopolitics, in Sri Lanka, even post-independence leaders decided that Sri Lanka should be a non-aligned country. I completely affirm that position.
In your answer to an earlier question, you talked about democratization. Now, there is this Development (Special Provisions) Bill. Critics say the bill seeks to concentrate power in the hands of a couple of ministers. How does it go with democratic norms in your view
This brings into focus a conflict. That is we want economic development on the one hand and rapid decision making on the other. We need to have consultation. We need to arrive at a healthy balance. That is the reason for the government to come up with this bill. The actual reason is to speed up investment and economic decision making. That is the goal of the bill.
Investors, rather than going to separate institutions for approvals, should have one place. There were two concerns that came up. One was that the government has several institutions and three levels of governance- provincial councils and local governments.
Any bill has to be consistent with the Constitution. If you have an efficient investment administration, investors will go to that particular province. Then, the provinces can compete with each other.
The other question is about concentration of power. The bill itself has some sunset clauses. It means the clauses of the bill will cease to operate after three years of enactment. I will say this bill is trying to resolve an issue. That is to speed up decision making. Presently, the way is unsatisfactory. Sri Lankas Doing Business Index is not improving significantly.
"The reason for the Development (Special Provisions) Bill is to speed up investment and economic decision making"

## Title: FCID Director transferred to Monaragala
## Section: Breaking News

FCID Director transferred to Monaragala
	
The sudden and unexpected transfer, based on promotion, of the director of the Police Financial Crimes Investigation Division (FCID), with immediate effect, to Monaragala District last week had raised eyebrows in many political circles, Daily Mirror learns.
The FCID director, SSP Anura Premashantha who was promoted to the rank of Deputy Inspector General (DIG) in mid December 2016 had been transferred to Monaragala District with immediate effect on Friday, December 23, 2016, Police Headquarters sources revealed yesterday.
Premashantha who received his promotion to the rank of DIG after winning a Fundamental Rights petition after stagnating as an Assistant Superintendent of Police (ASP) for a long time had reported for duty as DIG (Monaragala) on Monday, December 26.
According to the Police Departments procedure, a Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) would necessarily be the director of any given special police division or functional division countrywide. In some cases a Superintendent of Police (SP) could also hold the position due to the unavailability of a suitable SSP.
It is a regular practice that if one of these SSPs (director in charge of a special division or a functional division) is promoted to the rank of DIG he is transferred to a different posting that demands the requirements of a DIG -- such as being in charge of one of the functional districts countrywide or as DIG in charge of a particular police division.
But, in rare cases, if the promoted DIG is a highly competent officer who has acted as the director of a particular division, he is kept on as the director of that particular division at least until a suitable replacement is found.
With the sudden transfer of Director Premashantha, the FCID is crippled with no suitable officer to fill the vacant top post, which has temporarily been filled by one of the divisions Unit ASPs -- Pavithra Dayaratne -- as acting director.
Daily Mirror learns that the promotional transfer of SSP Premashantha had been referred to the National Police Commission for consideration by the Inspector General of Police, Pujith Jayasundara, despite a special written submission made by Ravi Waidyalankara, the Senior DIG in charge of the FCID, to retain DIG Premashantha under him as he is the most officer officer for the post.
Civil society groups fighting against the corruption of previous regime -- who had worked hand in hand with the FCID -- assert that the transfer was a politically motivated punishment, as it is not entirely against the practices of the Police Department to retain an officer promoted to the rank of DIG in his former posting.
The present directors in charge of the Presidential Security Division (PSD) and the State Intelligence Service (SIS) had been promoted to the rank of DIG from SSP sometime ago but they still remain as directors of their respective divisions.
Director PSD SSP G N Gunaratne and Director SIS SSP Nilantha Jayawardena, who were promoted to the rank of DIG, remain in their former postings as they are competent until such time as a suitable SSP is found to replace them, the sources said.
Concerned sources in civil society groups against corruption, as well as certain senior police detectives, maintain that the transfer was a politically motivated punishment as he was such a prominent top grade detective and he was tranfered to a mere interior functional district like Monaragala without even a suitable replacement.
Director Premashantha was the only senior officer who was up to date with all the top classified intelligence data and had access to all the corruption files of over 30 top politicians of the previous regime and who had initiated the move to refer 66 high-profile investigated cases to the Attorney General, the sources said.
Premashantha who was posted as the Director of FCID since February, 2015 when he was ASP, was given a double promotion to the ranks of SP and SSP at once in early 2016 after a Supreme Court decision.
He had to file an FR case in the Supreme Court in 2012 after waiting several years without being promoted to the rank of SP under the previous regime.
Informed sources told Daily Mirror that a secret tussle between IGP Jayasundara and SDIG Waidyalankara would have been instrumental in the transfer that could have been given the green light by a top state office.
Attempts made to get through to DIG Premashantha for comment was unsuccessful last night. (Kurulu Koojana Kariyakarawana)

A 52-year-old gem miner and father of two, was killed by another gem miner who had pushed his head into a mud hole because he had assaulted the latter's dog, in Horana, on Sunday night, police said.
The incident had occurred during a liquor party, when the victim had attacked a pet dog which belonged to the suspect. After a heated argument, the suspect had attacked the victim and pushed his head into a nearby mud-filled gem pit.
Afterwards, the suspect had gone to the gem pit owner and requested money to go to his home town. However, the owner had come to know that the suspect had killed the victim and, with the help of the people of the area, had caught the suspect and handed him over to the Police.

The Education Ministry has decided to launch a special investigation into the admission of the students to Grade 1 of popular schools in 2017, after receiving complaints that irregularities had taken place in the admissions.
The ministry said an investigation would be launched into the procedure of the school admissions to Grade 1 in 2017, in randomly selected popular schools around the country. Inquiring officers would visit the schools and examine the records relating to the admissions and also visit the addresses at which the students were said to be residing. (Ranjan Kasturi)

## Title: Greek Bond issue is being cunningly used as a red herring  Ajith Nivard Cabraal
## Section: News Features
## Date: 3 January 2017 12:02 am
Greek Bond issue is being cunningly used as a red herring  Ajith Nivard Cabraal
	
One time Central Bank Governor Ajith Nivard Cabraal, in an interview with the Daily Mirror speaks about the last budget and the current status of the economy. He shared the following:

In the recent budget, there is a proposal to remove some Central Bank functions such as Public Debt Management, to be vested with another Ministry. As a former CB governor, how do you see it 
The Central Bank carries out the Public Debt Management Function on behalf of the government. Therefore, as the Principal, the government can entrust that function to another body after amending the necessary laws. However, it must be noted that, until February 27, 2015, the public debt had been managed in an exemplary manner by the Central Bank whereby the funds required by the government were raised at the appropriate time at the least possible cost. To do so, the Bank had followed the time-tested policy of auction cum direct placement, which had ensured that the interests of the public and the government were safeguarded. 
It is only after January 2015 that controversies have arisen in relation to debt management, the root of which has already been identified as the arbitrary and sudden system change on February 27, 2015 as revealed by Central Bank internal examinations, Auditor Generals investigations, and two COPE probes. Hence, it would now be possible to deal with this situation in an appropriate manner by immediately discontinuing the present auction only system, and reverting back to the auction cum direct placement system, instead of indulging in further exercises to cover up the escalating debt management crisis. 
When I became Governor in 2006, Sri Lankas Debt to GDP ratio was 91%, and the Average Time to Maturity (ATM) of the Debt stock was 2.4 years. When I left in January 2015, the Debt to GDP had reduced to 71%, and the ATM had increased to 5.8 years. Further, by end 2014, Treasury interest rates ranged from about 5.6% for 3 months to about 9.5% for 30 years. This shows that the PDD and the CB are quite capable of carrying out the debt management function satisfactorily. Therefore, I hope the government would have the wisdom not to make ad hoc changes in order to cover up the present scams. 
How do you analyse the overall fiscal and economic situation of the country in the light of the current budget 
From 2010 onwards, Sri Lankas fiscal deficit has been on a downward trend from 7.0% in 2010 to 5.7% in 2014. This favourable trend has been helpful in moving the other key macro-fundamentals towards favourable levels. By end 2014, the average growth was 6.8% for the preceding 5 years, and the average inflation was mid-single digits. Foreign reserves were USD 8,208 million, and Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) had risen to USD 1,616 million from just USD 287 million in 2005. 
Unfortunately, these trends were reversed in 2015 with the uncontrolled spending causing the deficit to rise to 7.4%. Not only was this deficit detrimental to government finances, the reversal conveyed the message that the government was on a splurge of indisciplined spending, which frightened investors and disturbed the macro-fundamentals. 
Even as we speak, growth has fallen below 3%; foreign reserves have plummeted by about 25%; interest rates have doubled; inflation expectations have risen; FDIs have fallen to war-time levels; the stock market has lost significant value; exports have shrunk; the Rupee has depreciated significantly and the Balance of Payments (BOP) has turned from a surplus of USD 1.4 billion in 2014 to a deficit of USD 1.5 billion in 2015, with a likelihood that it would record a deficit this year as well; the Public Debt which was Rs. 7,391 billion by end December 2014, had shot up to Rs. 9,382 billion by end July 2016, thereby recording an increase of Rs. 1,991 billion in just 19 months; the massive depreciation of the Rupee has resulted in the public debt shooting up by Rs. 285 billion in 2015, and by another Rs. 141 billion up to July 2016, totalling Rs. 426 billion. That sum would have been sufficient to construct another Nurichcholai Power Plant, Colombo-Matara Expressway, Colombo-Katunayake Expressway, Mattala Airport and a Hambantota Port! Today, there is no asset to show for that increase of Rs. 426 billion of the liabilities in the countrys balance sheet. In the meantime, the unwarranted increase in interest rates due to the bond scams have added Rs. 66 billion to government expenditure in 2015, and another Rs.71 billion in 2016. 

"When I became Governor in 2006, Sri Lankas Debt to GDP ratio was 91%, and the Average Time to Maturity (ATM) of the Debt stock was 2.4 years. When I left in January 2015, the Debt to GDP had reduced to 71%, and the ATM had increased to
5.8 years"

In addition, the compensation liabilities that the government has recently incurred have been monumental. The arbitrary stoppage of the Port City Project led to a reported damages claim of USD 143 million (Rs.21 billion), and it is now well known that the government had to provide additional land to the Chinese company in consideration of dropping this claim. The unilateral cancellation of the Sri Lankan Airlines aircraft purchase resulted in another damages claim of USD 125 million (Rs. 19 billion), according to media reports. Another alarming feature has been that foreign investors in government securities who held nearly USD 4 billion in 2014 have now reduced their holdings to below USD 2 billion, and there is a real possibility that they would flee when the Fed raises the US policy rates in the next few weeks, putting even greater pressure on our Rupee and reserves. 
Unfortunately, all these critical factors have not been given sufficient attention in the budget debate, but have obviously been recognized by the International Rating Agencies who have recently downgraded the countrys credit rating and placed the economy on a negative watch. 
When you served in office, there was an allegation that you were responsible for causing a huge loss to the government by investing in Greek Bonds. How legitimate was
that allegation 
That allegation is completely untrue and unsubstantiated. The CBs decision to invest in Greek Bonds was a part of its reserve management strategy that was implemented in 2011. That strategy yielded the highest ever return of USD 430 million, or 6.6% on the reserves, in 2011. In contrast, with a reserve of a similar magnitude, the return that was generated by the CB in 2015 was only USD 111 million, or 1.8 %. 
Nevertheless, as you said, there was a FR Petition 457/2012 alleging that the Monetary Board and the CB were responsible for causing a huge loss by investing in Greek Bonds, filed by a Minister of the present government, when he was in the opposition. However, Leave to Proceed for such petition was refused by a Supreme Court bench comprising Justice Sripavan, (present Chief Justice), Justice Marasinghe and Justice De Abrew with the order that, Considering the totality of the circumstances, it is neither possible nor desirable to hold that the Members of the Monetary Board in taking a decision to invest in Greek Bonds, have acted arbitrarily, unreasonably and in a fraudulent manner. (See judgement dated September 18, 2014 in the website of the Supreme Court). The following extracts from the judgement would also be helpful to understand the true context re. this investment. 

"At present growth has fallen below 3%; foreign reserves have plummeted by about 25%; interest rates have doubled; inflation expectations have risen; FDIs have fallen to
war-time levels"

The investment in Greek Bonds and its trade forms part of the risk management strategy. If all investments are maintained as risk-free investments the return would be negligible. The CB therefore has to select a mix of low risk and risk-bearing investments expecting a reasonably high return 
The decision to invest in such Bonds was based on the trade-off between different risks faced and the CBs tolerance for higher risk on a very small part of its portfolio (only 0.6% of its portfolio was invested in Greece Bonds). Investing in high-yielding sovereign paper is an integral part of management of many funds in the world and the CB too had followed a similar practice 
It must also be stated that the Auditor General too, had confirmed that no irregularity had occurred, via his report dated October 11, 2012 to the Chairman of COPE. After such report, COPE had also accepted that although a loss had occurred, no wrong or illegal activity had taken place. 
In the face of the above judgement and other authoritative determinations, it would be seen that there is no basis for the sweeping allegations that are being made, and that the Greek Bond issue is being cunningly used as a red herring to divert attention from the Treasury Bond issue, which is causing acute embarrassment to the government. 
A minister of the previous regime once alleged that you had taken the decision to go for the controversial Hedging deal. It caused enormous loss to the government by way of payment of compensations to some foreign banks. How responsible were you for it 
When oil prices were rising rapidly in the second half of 2006, the Economic Research Department of the CB rightfully recommended that Sri Lanka should practise Hedging in order to meet the challenge to the economy arising from the rising oil prices. As per such recommendation, a presentation was made to the Cabinet by the CB, after which a detailed study was commissioned by the Cabinet. Based on that study, the Cabinet decided that the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) should undertake Hedging. Hedging is not an unknown or strange concept, but is a common practice that is used extensively in order to deal with risky economic situations. 
In that background, there is absolutely no nexus whereby the CB or the Monetary Board or the Governor could be held responsible for any loss from hedging, because what the CB did was merely its duty of managing economic risk by making a prudent recommendation to the Government, while the diligent implementation was a function of other organisations

"The massive depreciation of the Rupee has resulted in the public debt shooting up by Rs. 285 billion in 2015, and by anotherRs. 141 billion up to July 2016, totallingRs. 426 billion "

In relation to the loss and payment of compensation, the basic facts, as per my understanding and recollection, are as follows: When the unexpected happened and global oil prices suddenly declined, the CPC was exposed to damages claims from three banks that held hedging contracts with the CPC. Of the three claims which initially amounted to around USD 500 million, the Attorney General and Sri Lankan authorities were able to successfully repudiate one claim fully. However, the CPC was found liable in one court action, while one arbitration went against the Government. Nevertheless, the Sri Lankan authorities were able to successfully reduce the final payments through negotiations, and the final payment that was made to the two banks was a total of around USD 90 million, and that too, paid after many years. In the meantime, the CPC was able to import oil at the prevailing lower prices without any hindrance or interruption. 

	It is only after January 2015 that controversies had arisen in relation to debt management
	
	
	Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) had risen to USD 1,616 million from just USD 287 million in 2005
	
	
	Growth has fallen below 3%; foreign reserves have plummeted by about 25%; interest rates have doubled
	
In contrast, when the present government unilaterally cancelled the Port City project in January 2015, the government faced a damages claim of USD 143 million, which, according to reports, has been settled in an indirect manner by granting ownership rights to an additional 5 acres of prime property to be reclaimed, to the aggrieved developer. In that situation, it would be readily seen that the persons who took the decision to arbitrarily cancel this project could someday be held responsible for the compensation payment in kind, made to the developer by the government. 
In the meantime, the government has decided to take over some properties purchased by the CB in the United States and Brazil during your time. Could you share your views on it
The CBs decisions to purchase properties in USA and Brazil had been made after careful consideration, and diligently implemented in compliance with the prevailing rules, regulations and Laws. In addition, the necessary approvals, including those from the Cabinet, Monetary Board and Attorney General, had been obtained. It was not a sudden decision of one person. Notwithstanding such compliance and diligence, the present government has publicly stated that it wishes to take over these properties belonging to the Bank. In fact, I believe they may do so soon, because in a newspaper interview recently, a learned Minister gave the reason for the massive depreciation of the rupee as being due to the fact that the previous CB Governor had bought properties in the USA and Brazil! Following that logic therefore, by taking over the properties, the accomplished Minister would soon be able to appreciate the Sri Lankan Rupee back to Rs.131 against the US Dollar, from the current depreciated level of Rs.150, and thereby prove all traditional Central Bankers wrong in their theories of exchange rate management. 
According to the Daily Mirror of November 17, 2016, the properties in USA and Brazil are today valued at Rs.1,245.6 million, while the cost was Rs.734.3 million; an increase in value of Rs. 511.3 million (or 69.6%). This simple report itself confirms that the CB had made a prudent and practical investment.

He sulks over disowned glory
	
A certain prominent politico is said to be in a terrible sulk these days over undeserving persons getting the limelight and the credit for erecting the worlds tallest Christmas Tree.

The politico is going round blaming those involved in the project saying it is clearly no business of theirs for there is a specific Ministry to handle this kind of religious activity, they say.
The angry politico also complains that the people who wanted to erect the Tree did not have the decency at least to sound him on the idea at the outset. Now that they have done this damage, I dont mind their taking over the portfolio as well, the politico would often remark, they say.

With the local government polls round the corner, most prominent politicos have stopped gallivanting here and abroad and are back at the grass-roots to gear up their party machinery.

This young ambitious Blue party politico from the Kurunegala district the other day set about holding a meeting of the partys Bala-Mandalaya in his constituency with much fanfare to impress his leaders. And soon he learnt to his horror that almost all party activists in the area had hitched their allegiance to the Pohottuwa and had decided to boycott the event.
However, he could not call off the event without losing face. So he hit upon a bright idea  to make a request to employees of all co-operatives in the area to attend the Bala-mandalaya meeting holding out the promise of valuable gifts to all would-be attendees.
Some 300 employees had reportedly attended the meeting, most of them eager to receive a valuable gift package. However, they had received only a T-shirt each at the conclusion of the meeting, they say.

The National Policies and Economic Affairs Ministry, has with the intention of earning commissions, bypassed the Public Debt Department when calling for proposals from foreign and local banks to obtain a loan of US$1 billion, the joint opposition said.
It said it was the Central Bank's Public Debt Department which had the authority to obtain loans and not a ministry.
This loan too will be obtained at a fixed or floating rate with a maturity period of three years or more. It has always been the practice for the Debt Department to apply for loans. The Department of External Resources, which is under the purview of Prime Minister who is also the National Policies and Economic Affairs Minister, has no authority to obtain loans, MP Bandula Gunawardane told a news conference.
He said there was serious doubt about the entire procedure of calling for loans by the Ministry and said vested interests would be paid commissions through this move in the absence of transparency in the procedure. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

The Navy had earned Rs. 2.26 billion after taking over the Onboard Security Team Operations (OBST) from Avant Garde Maritime Services in 2016, the Navy said today.
Accordingly, the Navy had carried out a total of 5,928 shipments to the Galle harbour and 443 shipments to Colombo harbour during last year.
Meanwhile, since the inception of OBST operations from November 13, 2015 until January 02 this year, the Navy had earned an income of Rs. 2.63 Billion for a total of 7,457 shipments. Galle and Colombo harbours have carried out 6,922 and 535 shipments respectively averaging approximately 573 shipments a month Navy said.
The Galle and Colombo operation centres look after the receiving, holding and issuing of weapons, ammunitions and other related equipment belonging to foreign as well as local On Board Security Teams.
The earnings generated through OBST operations are directly deposited to the Consolidated Fund of the Sri Lankan Government.
With the Government annulling the agreement with Avant Garde, the Sri Lanka Navy was entrusted with the task of providing security to merchant vessels and supplying services to Security Firms involved in providing on-board security to merchant ships.
Since taking over these tasks, the Navy has ensured that the security requirements of the merchant vessels which frequent the High Risk Area (HRA) are provided efficiently, the Navy said. (Darshana Sanjeewa)

Price control on imported rice: Harrison
	
The Cabinet has decided to impose a price control on imported rice to prevent the price of rice from sky-rocketting, Rural Economic Affairs Minister P. Harrison said today.
President Maithripala Sirisena and the Cabinet will decide on the price of imported rice, he said adding that stocks of imported rice would arrive in the country within two weeks on tenders selected by Sathosa.
The minister said it was decided to import rice after several local rice millers failed to supply rice to Sathosa.
Nearly 138 rice millers had been issued stocks of paddy and hand over the rice to Sathosa. But only 28 millers had done so. Others have sold their rice to the private sector and as such have been blacklisted and cases filed against them, the minister said. President Maithripala Sirisena plays no part in the family-run company and in no way nurtures his brothers, unlike what the previous government did, he said.
The minister said rice mill owners were behind the rice mafia in the country and are attempting to gain a huge profit through the rice market.
He said the largest stock of 17,000 metric tons of paddy was released to Araliya Rice Mills proprietor Dudley Sirisena because he had made the highest bid. (Chaturanga Pradeep)

Probe refusal by two members to sign delimitation report: JVP
	
The Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) today called for an inquiry into refusal by two of the five committee members to sign the delimitation report.
JVP leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake said the report was compiled by a committee appointed to draft an error-free report after allegations that the previous report was prepared on a political agenda and contained several blunders.
The delimitation report compiled by the previous government was confusing. The delimitation was carried out by former minister Basil Rajapaksa at houses of SLFP organizers. So there was a need to compile a proper report. That is why a committee was appointed and had released their report. There must be an inquiry into why two members did not sign it, he said.
The MP told a news conference that the proposed electoral system was problematic as it was drafted on the requirement of former minister Basil Rajapaksa and even the then Provincial Councils Minister was unaware about it.
This electoral system allows only for a two-party system and expels other political parties. Even the Elections Commission Chairman says that some changes should be made to it. We are ready to submit our amendments. That complicated electoral system does not represent peoples mandate reasonably, he said.
The MP said the JVP had proposed that this local government election should be held under the proportional representation system because nobody knows as to when an election could be held under the proposed complicated system.
He said the government was becoming the saviour of those involved in fraud and corruption instead of punishing them and acquiring the stolen property.
The MP said the government had done little or nothing to stem the rising price of rice in the local market. (Ajith Siriwardana)

He said the Government had ignored the aspirations of the Tamil people and the demands made by the TNA for power devolution and the need to uphold the rights of the Tamils.
Mr. Premachandran said the Tamils had extended their support to the President with the hope of winning their rights through a new Constitution.

SL to renegotiate oil tanks deal with India
	
The Government will re-negotiate with India the agreement signed in 2002 with the hope of reacquiring at least 50 tanks for use by Sri Lanka, Petroleum Resources Development Minister Chandima Weerakkody said.
Outlining his Ministrys 2017 programme he said the refurbishment and upgrading of the Sapugaskanda Oil Refinery (SOR) will be launched this year at a cost between US$1.8 billion and US$2 billion. The minister said on the completion the SOR will increase its output to 100,000 barrels a day from less than 50,000 BPD at present and help reduce the annual oil import bill by cutting down on the import of refined petroleum products.
He told a media conference that the ministry has retained Ernest and Young Ltd., to prepare a Business Plan for the tank farm and will also speak to all stakeholders on the matter.
The tank farm in Trincomalee, built by the British during World War II, was leased to Lanka IOC in 2002 as part of a privatization deal, by the then UNP government, giving the Indians a presence in the port.
The Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) had attempted to refurbish 30 tanks with the help of Lanka IOC but the project did not come off.
The minister said three oil tanks each will be set up in Trincomalee and Hambantota to store petroleum products to prevent any shortage in the two future mega industrial zones.
Commenting on the ongoing drought the minister said his Ministry would provide all assistance to the Power and Renewable Energy Ministry for an uniterrupted power supply.
Year 2016 was extremely successful with the CPC recording a profit of Rs.85 billion, Petroleum Research Development Secretariat (PRDS) US$369 million and the Ceylon Petroleum Storage Terminals Ltd. (CPSTL) Rs.2.7 billion.
Meanwhile, the minister said the unity government would continue in office until 2020, whatever the joint opposition, SLPP and Mahinda Rajapaksa loyalists said because it was strong enough to withstand any kind of political challenges coming its way. (Sandun A Jayasekera)

Two Citilink bosses quit after 'drunk' pilot is caught on camera
	
Two Indonesian budget airline bosses have quit after video emerged of a pilot allegedly showing up to fly a plane while drunk.
Footage showed captain Tekad Purna, a pilot for Citilink, appearing to stagger through a metal detector at a security checkpoint at Surabaya airport in Indonesia.
The pilot repeatedly drops his belongings onto the floor, prompting security guards to pick them up.
He is believed to have made it onto the plane, which had 154 passengers, before passengers became suspicious when they allegedly heard slurred words and unclear announcements from the cockpit.
Some left the plane and asked for a replacement of the pilot, who they believed to be either drunk or under the influence of drugs.
Citilink assigned a new pilot to fly the Airbus A320 about an hour behind schedule.
One passenger posted a video of the announcement online.
Mr Purna has not responded to the allegations.
Citilink President Director Albert Burhan announced that he and the airlines production director would resign over the controversy.
The pilot had committed serious violation of standard operation procedure that endangered passengers, Mr Burhan said.
We apologise for the discomfort. I have to be responsible for that and therefore I and my production director resign.
Citilink, a subsidiary of national flag carrier Garuda Indonesia, previously dismissed reports the 32-year-old pilot was drunk, saying initial tests of drug and alcohol were negative. 
On Friday, the airline announced it had sacked Tekad.
He is said to have undergone medical tests at a clinic in Surabaya, East Java, as well as a second test in Jakarta, The Jakarta Post reports.
The results of the medical checkups will be released next week.
In December last year, three crew members, a pilot and two flight attendants, were arrested for allegedly consuming crystal methamphetamine, known locally as shabu-shabu, at a hotel. (independent.co.uk)

Uma Oya Development Project: Multi-purpose or multi-destructive
	
Despite the visible effects of the Uma Oya Multipurpose Development Project in the form of houses collapsing, land surfaces cracking, wells and brooks drying up, residents being displaced and losing their traditional livelihood, the budget 2017 promises to accelerate the completion of the project.
Accordingly, a staggering Rs.13,000 million has been allocated for the project alone, and it is envisioned that the task would not only provide the much needed water to farmer families, but also generate electricity and provide drinking water. 
However, on Sunday, W.M. Kusumawathi, a resident of Bandarawela, told Daily Mirror that 20 houses had started collapsing in the area, 300m to the right from the tunnel. This includes well-constructed houses worth Rs. 8,500, 000 as well. Walls have started sinking while cracks appeared on them and also on the ground.
In this state of uncertainty, it was reported yesterday that the residents had to vacate their houses at night for their safety. In the light of this unfortunate situation, Daily Mirror spoke to a few concerned parties on the destruction inflicted by the Uma Oya Multipurpose Development Project which is of several-fold.

The Uma Oya Multipurpose Development Project
The Uma Oya Multipurpose Development Project (UOMDP), initially drafted by the Central Engineering Consultancy Bureau in 1991, was rejected by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) because the project violated the water rights of people and due to technical faults. However, in 2008, the Iranian Government stepped in and the two governments inked an agreement -- Iran has pledged to provide 85% of the estimated total cost (USD 529 million) as a loan. The main contractor is FARAB Energy and Water Project Company.
According to the performance report (2015-2016) by the Power and Renewable Energy Ministry, the UOMDP is intended to divert 145 MCM of water to South Eastern Sri Lanka in a bid to improve irrigation. The tunnel being constructed, which is expected to divert 200 million cu.m of water annually from Uma Oya to Kirindi Oya, includes an underground power station at Randeniya. This Project also includes proposals to build reservoirs in Puhulpola and Dyraaba, and a 4-km-long tunnel connecting the two reservoirs. The approximate total length of the tunnel is 26km.
The two pelton turbines installed will be of 60-MW capacity each. 290 gigawatt hours (GWh) of electricity is to be generated annually. The power plant is supposed to connect to the national grid through the Badulla Grid Sub-station through a high-voltage transmission line.
According to experts, the Uma Oya project will be the last major hydropower development project in Sri Lanka, as the two other projects proposed to be developed - Moragahakanda and Broadlands - can only generate 25MW and 35MW respectively. The project is being executed in the area from Welimada to Hambantota, and affects the Badulla, Monaragala and Hambantota Districts.

We encountered a huge leakage in the tunnel last week
- Dr. Sunil De Silva, Uma Oya Project Director
We have observed water seeping into the tunnel at several places. We keep on sealing and moving ahead. We encountered a huge leakage in the tunnel last week. Around 400 litres per second is being leaked, said Dr. Sunil De Silva, Uma Oya Project Director. Referring to the compensation scheme followed, he said, once damage was reported, teams were dispatched to inspect and do a track survey. Through the Divisional Secretary, we submit it to the Valuation Department. Then, the officials there visit the areas and make a valuation report. We pay compensation based on this report, he said.
Further, Mr. De Silva stated that they accepted a link between the water ingress and damages to houses because as soon as they encountered a huge ingress, they received reports about damage to property.
When asked about water bodies drying up and the shortage of water, Mr. De Silva said there was a drought continuing since June last year and that it might have had some impact on these concerns.
However, we have been continuously distributing water to households. Initially, we distributed water to 700 houses, but now there are about 1,100 of them. We also face difficulties in finding water for distribution. The water board curtailed the supply to us because they had to supply to Bandarawela and other areas. We are distributing water with about 22 bowsers, he said.
Meanwhile, Mr. De Silva said there were three water supply schemes already approved by the government to provide pipeline water.
The schemes are expected to be complete by the end of February or March. Then, there will be pipeline water for nearly 2,400 families, he said. When asked about the two reservoirs proposed to be constructed, Mr. De Silva said: The Dyraaba reservoir has come up to one top level. Excavation for the Puhulpola reservoir is complete and we have just started concreting. It will be complete by October this year. However, we cannot fill it with water because we have to complete the tunnel. Otherwise the tunnel will go underwater.
He added that the Uma Oya project was targeted to end by 2018 though most activities would be completed this year. 
Disputes have arisen between neighbours
- Saliya Seneviratne, an individual resettled in Mirahawatte
Saliya Seneviratne, who has been resettled in Mirahawatte, said there was no such infrastructure as they were promised with prior to resettling.
Due to the absence of a drainage system, disputes have arisen between neighbours. We have to go to Mathetilla Oya (2km away from Mirahawatte) to fetch water, he said.
According to Mr. Seneviratne, the least extent of land offered was 10 perches while the largest stood at 40. Hence, those who owned acres of land in Puhulpola are at a disadvantage.

If the leakage could be stopped, subsidence could be minimised
- Prof. Rohan Fernando
Speaking to Daily Mirror, Rohan Fernando, a professor of Geology at the Open University, said: You need to have a large quantity of water in the Uma Oya to divert water to Kirindi Oya. The plan would have been acceptable if they had one river catchment in the wet zone, so water could be obtained through the South Western monsoon. Then the other catchment could get water from the North Eastern monsoon. But now, both basins get water from the North East monsoon during which they are filled, and during the South Western monsoon, both catchments were dried up.
Two years ago, a major leak occurred -- water seeped through the leak at 450 litres per second. After a month or so, the speed decelerated to 250 litres per second. Usually, when water seeps through fractures, it means that all the wells located above the tunnel are dried up as the water table goes down. This is a natural phenomenon. They have spent a colossal amount of money trying to seal it. Finally, they ended up with 90 litres per second, he added.
Stating that this situation was never predicted in the EIA, Mr. Fernando said if the leakage could be stopped, subsidence, which has led to landslides and houses being collapsed, could be minimised.
Acres of farmland are barren and unsuitable for vegetation
Samantha Vidyarathna, Uva Provincial Councillor
Samantha Vidyarathna, the Uva Provincial Councillor and convener of the Peoples Front against the Uma Oya multi-destructive Project, said some 3,850 houses were destroyed due to side effects of the project.
Nearly 2,000 wells and springs have dried up. Heel Oya in Bandarawela is completely dried up. The upcountry is known for its vegetation. But now, acres of farmland are barren and unsuitable for vegetation due to water scarcity. Thousands of innocent families are displaced as a result, he said.
Mr. Vidyarathna lamented that temples, churches, kovils, mosques and schools had been destroyed.
Makulwella school in Bandarawela, for instance, is under threat and there is a warning against children gathering there, he said, adding that a newly-constructed Chaithya had cracked and exploded. Work in several shops at the Bandarawela junction has come to a halt, he added. Asserting that the destruction inflicted by the project was far and wide, Mr. Vidyarathna said the Ella, Bandarawela, Hali-ela, Welimada, Uva Paranagama and Wellawaya divisional secretariat regions have been affected severely.
He pointed out that the Kandakettiya, Mahiyanganaya, Dehiattakandiya, Hasalaka and Hettipola divisional secretariat zones would be affected in the future.
Further, Mr. Vidyarathna stated that though there was a compensation scheme in place, the process had been tardy. Our struggle would persist despite the apparent failure in the protests and discussions with the president, in the parliament and the provincial council, he said.

There is not a drop of water left
-W.M. Kusumawathi, President of Diriya Kantha Govi Organisation
Diriya Kantha Govi Organisation President W.M. Kusumawathi of Bandarawela said there was not a drop of water left as water bodies had dried up as a result of the project.
Water bowsers provide us with 500 to 1,000 litres of water per household to be used during eight to ten days. But this is inadequate even for a single day, she said.
However, as the result of a protest, they have succeeded in obtaining Rs. 1,363,805 needed for pipeline water.
Meanwhile, Mrs. Kusumawathi pointed out that there had been a large-scale land grabbing to accommodate the project.

"Water bowsers provide us with 500 to 1,000 litres of water per household to be used during eight to ten days. But this is inadequate even for a single day,"
Residents in Puhulpola have been resettled in Mirahawatte. People were offered illusions of a beautiful life in Mirahawatte. But there isnt a proper road.
The lands are barren. Damage has been assessed up to 300m from the tunnel to the right and left sides. But we cannot endorse this assessment because damage has been caused up to 800m. The maximum compensation offered is Rs. 100, 000. But the true value of a house is around Rs. 10,000,000.
Therefore, we cannot accept this compensation either, she said, adding that this assessment was done according to the evaluation formed in 1981.
The project is flawed in its design.

- Hemantha Withanage, Executive Director, Centre for Environmental Justice
We filed legal action due to the damages caused to houses and the water table. As a result, the court directed the Irrigation Department to pay compensation, and that had been assessed. However, some people are content and some are not. Some have not received any compensation, said Hemantha Withanage, Executive Director, Centre for Environmental Justice.
The petition filed before the Supreme Court has named Mahaweli Development and Environment Ministry Secretary Nihal Rupasinghe, Central Environmental Authority (CEA), and the Attorney General as respondents.
People whose houses were fully-damaged have not received adequate compensation to rebuild their residences, Mr. Withanage said, adding that the available land was also not suitable to reconstruct houses.
The whole water table has got damaged and it is continuing to happen,
so affecting around 5,000-6,000 families. Some people have lost the harvest for almost five seasons. As there is no accurate system to assess damage where crops are involved, an agreement has been reached to assess the damage through two basic crops - tomatoes and beans. However, once again, not everyone has received compensation, he said. Noting that the underground tunnel was being dug close to the surface, Mr. Withanage stated that cracks appeared on surfaces and houses that collapsed as a consequence.
The project is flawed in its design. The tunnel runs close to the surface. In certain areas, the gap between the tunnel and the surface is 250m. The damage caused is more in the surrounding areas here. Paddy fields have dried up as a result of the water seepage. There is no solution proposed to rectify this situation, he said.

"People whose houses were fully-damaged have not received adequate compensation to rebuild their residences"
Meanwhile, commenting on the Environment Impact Assessment (EIA), Mr. Withanage said an accurate and complete EIA had not been conducted.
They have done the EIA for the tunnel - which is basically the diversion from Puhulpola (in Welimada) and up to the end of the tunnel. When water is directed to Alikotara in Wellawaya, it will be diverted to certain canals and thereafter to Kuda Oya. Some of the existing tanks will also get water, but they are going to build a new tank. This is supposed to destroy 5,000 acres of forest. This part has not been assessed, he said.
He added that though the original EIA pointed out that 1,500 elephants and several villages would be affected, there was no accurate EIA performed.
You need to do a complete EIA. But, unfortunately, the CEA has turned a blind eye to this process. This is against the EIA laws in the country, he said.
According to the annual performance report (2013) by the Irrigation and Water Resource Management Ministry, the Environmental Impact Assessment for the Headwork was approved by the CEA and the Final Feasibility Study Report was submitted by the contractor in February 2012.
The Environment Impact Assessment was very flawed. It has outdated and erroneous data. Therefore all decisions based on that faulty document tend to be faulty, said environmentalist Jagath Gunawardane.
Residents and farmers were fooled
- Gunathilake, a resident
Gunathilake, a resident affected by the Uma Oya Project, admitted that environmentalists forewarned them of the destruction that could take place.
Residents were given a wrong impression when the project was initiated. Residents and farmers were fooled. They told us that the Uma Oya project would ensure employment for our children in the generations to come. They never made us aware of the negatives of the project. This is the untold truth, he charged, speaking at a press briefing organised by the Peoples Alliance for Right to Land (PARL).
