Muslim MPs, Ministers seek meeting with President
	
Muslim Ministers and MPs in the Government would meet President Maitripala Sirisena to discuss action that should be taken against anti-Muslim sentiments, which they said was rising once again.
A Muslim MP, who did not wished to be named, said they decided to seek an appointment with the President to discuss the issue at a meeting they had in Colombo over the weekend.
We do not think the meeting would take place soon as the talk of a Cabinet reshuffle is in the offing. But we expect to meet the President after the busy period is over, he said.
According to the MP some had suggested that some action was essential as nothing had been done by this Government so far to curb religious and communal hatred.
Ministers including Rauff Hakeem, Mujibur Rahaman and several others have participated at this meeting, he said. (Yohan Perera)

Some Ministers should be removed: Amaraweera
	
Ministers, who had allegations of corruption against them should be removed from the Cabinet, General Secretary of the UPFA Mahinda Amaraweera said on Saturday.
It is sad to note that some Ministers, who are involved in corruption, still remain in the Cabinet though they should be removed from it, Minister Amaraweera said at a public function over the weekend.
Much is said about a Cabinet reshuffle but my opinion is that those Ministers, who are only interested in safeguarding their families and trample the people should be removed, he added.
The United People's Freedom Alliance (said there were some Ministers, who think the Ministries they hold were their personal properties.
It is a sad state of affairs if there are ministers who think about their political party and fight for Ministries, the Minister further said.
It is not good to look for ministerial posts for his or her survival, while one should be prepared to work for the people no matter what Ministry he gets. I was the Minister of Disaster Management but people were not even aware that such a Ministry existed, he said.
At the Ministry of Fisheries I have been able to convert several institutions under that ministry into profit making entities, he said.
Further the Minister said some businessmen had engaged in creating a rice shortage in the country and the Government should focus on it and see to it that there was no shortage of rice.
Speaking on the North Central Province, the Minister said some members of the Provincial Council had got themselves into a mess by trying to capture the office.
One cannot come to office of a provincial council in such a manner, he said.(Chandraratne Gamage)

Trump signs tremendous deals with Saudi Arabia
	

President Donald Trump made a splashy debut on the world stage here Saturday, ushering in a new era in U.S.-Saudi Arabian relations by signing a joint strategic vision that includes $110 billion in American arms sales and other new investments that the administration said would bring hundreds of thousands of jobs. 
It was a great day, Trump said. He cited tremendous investments in the United States . . . and jobs, jobs, jobs. 
While initial details were scant, the agreements signed included a U.S. letter of intent to support Saudi Arabias defence needs with sales of a number of items - naval ships, tanks and other vehicles - that were the subject of agreements under earlier administrations, as well as some new items that had never passed the discussion stage, such as sophisticated THAAD missile defence systems. 
Trump was received like visiting royalty from the moment Air Force One touched down in Riyadh on Saturday morning, after an all-night flight from Washington, where he hoped to leave behind the growing Russia scandal threatening his presidency. there was public silence from the U.S. delegation on the issue of human rights in Saudi Arabia, which has imprisoned peaceful critics of the government and has sharply restricted the rights of women. Ahead of the visit, Trumps advisers said the president did not intend to lecture his hosts.

Why replace the Best Finance Minister Asks JO
	
The government should reveal the reason for replacing its Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake who was not long ago awarded the title of Finance Minister of the Year for Asia-Pacific-2016 by The Banker magazine, the joint opposition said today.
Commenting on the Cabinet reshuffle, JO National Organiser, MP Dullas Alahapperuma said after naming Minister Karunanayake as the Best Finance Minister a few a months ago it is a mystery as to why he had to be removed.
The government should also clarify why Foreign Affairs Minister Mangala Samaraweera was removed. He was described as the person who was in the forefront of achieving reconciliation while helping war heroes to escape the electric chair, he told Daily Mirror.
The MP said they were of the view that the Cabinet reshuffle was based on achieving two objectives  it was to strip Minister Arjuna Ranatunga from the portfolios of Port and Shipping and to give Minister Mangala Samaraweera the media portfolio.
He said there were objections from inside and outside government against the sale of state resources, especially the agreements to lease the Hambantota Harbour to China and the Trincomalee oil tank farm to India.
Minister Ranatunga was one of those who objected to these agreements and was clearly an obstacle to signing these two agreements. Therefore, he was given another portfolio, the MP said.
He said the government was determined to bring in Constitutional reforms by hook or by crook and to achieve this, it needed a media minister similar to the like the one from 1994 to 2000.
This government is following the footsteps of President J.R. Jayewardene and planning to hold a referendum instead of holding elections. The government is not allowing the mandate of the people to be to operate and keep postponing local government elections. This is why it needs a media minister with the experience to move the constitution-making process forward, the MP said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Beeralu craft, facing a disappointing future
	
A Beeralu making equipment called Beeralu Kotte

Coir products, reed and cane craft, lacquer work, cloth-weaving and many other traditional Sri Lankan crafts are disappearing from the country, but they have the potential to earn immensely from foreign and local markets as well. 
The open economy compelled people to buy imported goods and those were valued over local products, and this led to the neglect of local crafts. There was once a golden period in Sri Lankan history, when traditional craftsmanship flourished. The former Womens Chamber of Industry and Commerce (WCIC) chairperson Daya Jayaratne managed to exhibit our Beeralu lace at the ninth annual Asia House fair held in March in England. She says she was surprised by the interest exhibited by European women for our hand-made beeralu lace. The beeralu on display was from award winning lace maker M.B. Priyani of Galle. 
The government is not helping artisans or sponsoring them. The government must make a market for them and solve their professional problems, Daya Jayaratne said. 
Ms Jayaratne emphasized the importance to uplift traditional craftsmanship: They dont have a place to display their articles and the places like Laksala have displayed a few beeralu creations at very exorbitant prizes. 
Sri Lankan Beeralu stall at Asia House Exhibition

The governments efforts to help the artisans is poor. There are many ministries in the government, but the heritage of our country has been neglected and therefore the crafts are dying. Other Asian countries like Pakistan, India and Malaysia have had many stalls and we were the only stall representing Sri Lanka, without any support or sponsorship from the government. In other Asian countries, artisans have the governments support for their traditional craftsmanship. Many European people were interested in Sri Lankan crafts and most of them told us they have been to Sri Lanka. But they never came across those artefacts anywhere before. We have a good market in Europe, as many Sri Lankans live there. she described the international platform. 
If the government can train village women to make quality products with their traditional expertise, even the local market will be good enough. Village women create a lot of coir-based products like brooms, but people prefer to buy plastic ones instead, because those products are not of the expected quality. That is one of the causes for importing more plastics into the country. If the government can train these women to produce quality goods, it will benefit them, traditional crafts and the country also, M/s Jayaratne saiad. 
Beautean, a famous beeralu weaver
History of Beeralu weaving
Beeralu weaving was popularized in Sri Lanka after Portuguese invasion in the 16th century. Later the Dutch also contributed in developing the Industry. Even though the Portuguese and Dutch periods were the golden age of Beerlu industry in Sri Lanka, it is considered that the Malays who arrived here from Indonesian islands and the Malay region, were the first to introduce the craft to the island. Ancient kings and their queens appreciated Beeralu lace profusely. The book titled Beeralu lace in Ancient Ceylon says the history of Sri Lankan Beeralu industry dates over 600 years. In the past, weaving beeralu was a way of showing skill, a hobby and an extra earning for village womenfolk. 
The southern coastal area in Sri Lanka was famous for its beautifully crafted beeralu lace. Many housewives were engaging in the traditional craft inherited from their ancestors. When the Tsunami struck the island in 2004, many artisans lost their families, homes and their hard earned properties, including beeralu making equipment. Some of them were rehabilitated in Tsunami villages. Winning the battle of life was never easy for them, and to earn a living, they turned to their familiar livelihood again. Most of the village women are weaving beeralu. They are supplied materials, trained but not given a proper and profitable market for their toil. Therefore, they have to sell products themselves or sell to shop owners at a lower price. There are a number of problems faced by the remaining beeralu weavers in the country. 
Weaving process

We travelled to Magalla, a village ten minutes away off the Galle highway exit. Beautean, a famous beeralu weaver and winner of many beeralu competitions showed us her skill in weaving beeralu lace. Her mother, brother and sister-in-law and even the children of the family are helping with lace making. They weave beautiful designs, jackets, table mats and many other items with beeralu lace. Weaving lace is not an easy task. It requires trained expertise, concentration and patience. They price their creations at higher prices, as they earn a living out of it. 
Being an experienced instructor in a beeralu lace making class organized by the National Craft Council, Beautean said; those of the young generation dont attend our classes. If more youngsters participate, we will be able to pass our knowledge on to the future. 
Drawing the pattern

"Even though the Portuguese and Dutch periods were the golden age of Beeralu industry in Sri Lanka, it is considered that the Malays who arrived here from Indonesian islands and the Malay region, were the first to introduce the craft to the island"

Many Beeralu weavers we met were housewives in their late 50s & 60s and it seemed that weaving beeralu brought an extra income to them and it was a daily routine. These traditional crafts lack the enthusiastic labour necessary for its existence as the younger generation keeps rejecting their heritage; artisans complain often. Their children would consider this traditional employment an embarrassment, due to the unacceptability of modern society. Only the urban upper class is making money with these surviving traditional crafts, due to their marketing and thinking skills as well as the high demand from the urban market, especially from the fashion industry. 
The beeralu lace industry is facing a disappointing future with lagging demand and will likely become an ancient practice that can be seen only in museums if these beeralu weavers are not supported by
the government.

CRUELTY at Cadet Training Camp
	

In February this year while a group of freshers of the Peradeniya University were being abused and tortured in a rented house off campus by senior students of the university, a group of schoolboys allegedly underwent a similar fate at the Rantambe training camp. A group of junior cadets of the Pilawela Maha Vidyalaya in Kundasale who were taken to the Rantambe training camp for an eight day cadet programme, were brutally harassed by their seniors. Parents of the ten victimized students, who did not want their identities disclosed for fear of reprisals, told Daily Mirror that when the alleged culprits were produced before courts, the video which contained visual evidence of the ordeal their children had gone through, was not produced.

Ten school boys allegedly harassed by senior students

On February 16 a group of twenty five cadets including ten junior cadets from Grade 10 and 11 took part in the eight day programme at the Rantambe training camp. However, their parents allege that three Advanced Level students of the same school, treated the children inhumanly, abused them and derived sadistic pleasure. When the parents visited the children on the sixth day of their stay the children have not informed the parents of the abuse as they had been threatened. Once students returned home on February 24 initially there was nothing to cause alarm. However, news spread that a group of students had been treated inhumanly and eventually the story unravelled as to what had taken place. 
My son told me that they undressed him, tied him to a bed and harassed him, said the father of a victim. The abuse had taken place at night after 9.00pm. Some students had discovered that they were naked only in the morning, which has raised suspicion among parents as to whether the children had been given sedatives. The father also said that the abuse was so severe that students had even planned to escape. He said that if they had carried out their plan their lives would have been at risk as the camp was in a hilly area surrounded by electric fences erected against elephants. 


"The police obtained statements from the victims and arrested the suspects. The victims were referred to the Manikhinna Hospital where they have been questioned"

The mother of another victim said that the three alleged suspects had videoed the incident through a mobile phone. On their way back from the camp the victims have informed the teacher-in-charge of their ordeal and the video, and he had confiscated the mobile phone. The mobile phone was later handed over to the Principal of the Pilawela Maha Vidyalaya. 
The father who had watched the video said that he was distraught afterwards. I couldnt watch the whole video because the children were naked and they were struggling to be free from the seniors grip. In the first scene a boy who was gagged, was wriggling, he said. The father also said that the children had been given saliva mixed food. 
After several meetings with the Principal she had informed the parents that she was not in a position to take any action. When contacted by Daily Mirror Udeni Dunuwila, the Principal of the Pilawela Maha Vidiyalaya said that all necessary measures pertaining to the incident were taken, and that since the incident took place some time back it was futile to publicize the story over and over again, as it affected the dignity of the school. When asked specifically as to the measures taken by the school in response to the incident, the Principal said that it came under the purview of the Rantambe Cadet school. 

"The case will be taken up once again before the Mahiyanganaya Magistrate on June 19"

Parents said that the Rantambe training centre conducted investigations. However, attempts made to contact the National Cadet Corps were not successful. 
Disheartened and disgruntled by the Principals response, parents had called the police emergency hotline 119. The Wattegama Police rushed to the scene and conducted preliminary investigations. Parents said that police officers were unable to watch the video completely, as the harassment was very disturbing. The police obtained statements from the victims and arrested the suspects. The victims were referred to the Manikhinna Hospital where they have been questioned. 
The Acting Officer-In-Charge of the Wattegama Police IP Peiris said that initial investigations were conducted by the Wattegama Police and that the case was referred to the Hasalaka Police for further investigations. After the incident was reported to the police, we got statements from the ten victims who were brutally abused. We arrested the three suspects. As the incident took place in Rantambe, it fell under the purview of the Hasalaka Police. Therefore, we transferred the case to the Hasalaka Police, he said. 


"On inquiry we found that the Hasalaka Police was in possession of the mobile phone, SIM and the memory chip. Its Officer-in-Charge Rathnayake said that they were produced before the Mahiyanganaya Courts"


According to the Hasalaka Police when the three suspects were produced before the Mahiyanganaya Magistrate courts on February 28, they were released on two sureties worth Rs. 100,000. Parents allege that the video recording was neither produced nor mentioned by the police before courts, and that the police was treating the matter as a trivial case when in reality victims are still mentally affected by the incident. Parents said that children still screamed and moaned at night, and that they have been given talismans to wear to protect themselves. 
On inquiry we found that the Hasalaka Police was in possession of the mobile phone, SIM and the memory chip. Its Officer-in-Charge Rathnayake said that they were produced before the Mahiyanganaya Courts. We can investigate into their content only through a court order. This may happen in future when its debated in courts, he said. When asked about the video, the officer said that the content of the evidence produced before courts has not been investigated into, and therefore he was not aware. Further investigations are still underway. 
The case will be taken up once again before the Mahiyanganaya Magistrate on June 19.

Geetha conundrum: Speaker issues statement
	
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya has denied various allegations on the actions he had taken with regard to the Parliamentary seat of MP Geetha Kumarasinghe and assured that he was committed to the safeguarding the rights of the MPs.
Following is a statement issued by his office:
It has come to our attention that certain parties have made statements targeting the Speaker with regard to the court ruling on Ms. Kumarasinghes seat.
When a seat in Parliament falls vacant due to some reason, informing that to the Elections Commission immediately in compliance with the Constitution and the elections law, is a task assigned to the Secretary General of Parliament.
The ruling regarding Ms. Geetha Kumarasinghes seat in Parliament was conveyed to Speaker in the afternoon of the 3rd of May 2017.
The said court ruling was referred to the Secretary General of Parliament by the Speaker as per the procedure. Thereafter, subsequent to consulting the Attorney General as well about the measures to be taken by the Secretary General of Parliament, it was referred to the Elections Commission in the afternoon of the May 8, 2017 for further action.
The relevant ruling of the Court of Appeal had not been subjected to any reconsideration or stay by any superior court up to that point. However, we wish to point out that the relevant matter was informed to the Elections Commission by Parliament after a lapse of three working days, while similar rulings had been conveyed to the Commissioner of Elections after a lapse of one working day in certain earlier occasions.
Accordingly, there is no undue urgency or delay was involved in conveying the relevant ruling to the Elections Commission and that the ordinary procedure has been followed in compliance with the Constitution and the elections law.
Thus, any claim by any party that informing the Elections Commission about the ruling of the Court of Appeal regarding Ms . Kumarasinghes Parliamentary seat was faulty and that Speaker has acted on the agenda of the Government, is a total distortion of facts or one made out of ignorance.
The Speaker will be committed in future as well to protect the rights of Parliamentarians to the best of his ability within the limitations applicable to such office, the media release said.

Global default risks mostly receded in past year: StanChart
	
REUTERS: Risk perception for most of the worlds countries have improved in the past year, according to a Standard Chartered analysis of credit default swaps (CDS), contrasting with deterioration in France, Italy, the United States and Germany.
CDS are derivatives used by investors to hedge against a default or restructuring of debt. The higher the risk of default, the higher the CDS spread.
StanChart said in a report that the CDS spreads of 35 countries showed Venezuela, Greece and Ukraine are still perceived as the sovereigns most at risk of default, with Venezuela trading with spreads of more than 3,000 basis points.
But 31 of the countries, including the above, saw spreads tighten since March 2016, it said, attributing the gains to oils price rise and improving economic growth across the developing world.
The main message  of an improving global picture  is in line with our own global GDP forecast: we see real GDP growth edging up markedly by 0.5 percentage point to 3.6 percent in 2017. This would be the strongest acceleration of global output since 2010, the bank told clients.
But it said a packed election calendar had driven a sharp rise in French and Italian CDS, with the former having widened as much as 65 percent on fears that the right-wing Marine le Pen could win presidential elections held in April-May 2017.
That possibility was done away last weekend as centrist Emmanuel Macron scored a decisive second-round win over Le Pen. French CDS have since fallen to around 30 bps, according to IHS Markit, after surging above 60 bps in February.
CDS for Italy, which goes to the polls early next year with a plethora of eurosceptic parties in the running, rose by 42 percent in the past year, according to StanChart.
U.S. CDS meanwhile widened by 13 percent over a year marked by the election of Donald Trump as President on a anti-globalisation, anti-immigration platform.
German CDS widened five percent, which StanChart attributed to perceived contagion effects for the country, reflecting its role as the engine of the euro area.

India to permit private firms to build military equipment
	

Hindustan Times, New Delhi, 20.05.2017 -
The Indian Defence Ministry on Saturday cleared the decks for private sector players to build military equipment such as fighter jets, submarines and armoured vehicles in India.
It finalised the broad contours of a policy that would work as a template for cooperation between Indian and foreign firms for military hardware. The government had released its defence procurement procedure in March 2016 but without a key chapter on the strategic partnership model that would govern collaboration between foreign vendors and Indian companies for defence manufacturing. The ministry held a series of meetings with defence equipment manufacturers and industry associations before finalising the model.

Iran hardliners sulk after Rouhani win, say they must be heard
	

REUTERS, 21st MAY, 2017-Iranian hardliners indignant at President Hassan Rouhanis re-election vowed on Sunday to press their conservative agenda, with some saying his caustic campaign trail attacks on their candidate would bring a backlash.
Rouhani won decisively with 57 percent of the vote on Friday, with promises of more engagement with the outside world, more economic opportunities for Irans youth, as well as social justice, individual freedoms and political tolerance.
The president, known for decades as a conciliatory figure, remade himself on the campaign trail as a reformist political street fighter, accusing hardliners of brutality and corruption in language that frequently strained at the boundaries of what is permitted in Iran. At one point, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei called rhetoric in a TV debate unworthy. In his victory speech, Rouhani continued to sound his defiant note, saying the nation had chosen the path of interaction with the world, away from violence and extremism.
Some conservatives were further angered when Rouhanis supporters danced and sang in the streets in some cities on Saturday evening to celebrate his victory. Men and women participated together, testing the strict rules meant to enforce sexual segregation in public in Iran.
Rouhanis defeated rival, hardline judge Ebrahim Raisi, a protege of Khamenei, said in his first comments after the election that the almost 16 million voters who supported him must not be ignored.

J'pura Hospital should provide treatment for clergy free of charge - NBF
	
Issuing a statement National Bhikku Front (NBF) urges the President to resume the free treatments for clergy at at Sri Jayewardenepura (SJP) Hospital yesterday.
In a letter sent to President Maithripala Sirisena NBF has showed their displeasure over the hospital decision and raised their concerns on the free health care service in the country.
The NBF General Secretary Ven. Wakamulle Uditha Thera said the SJP hospital had carried out a good quality practice however, are now charging from the monks who are seeking treatment out of five km radius.
The NBF has condemned the hospital authority's decision and said during a time when the country celebrated the International Vesak Day the move had sent negative message to the world that the government is not providing medical assistance to the Monks in the country.
The countrys population of clergy is less than 100,000 a 0.43% percent of the total population. In that context it is very low population that seeks treatment from Sri Jayewardenepura Hospital. It is a discriminatory judgement not only in the health sector but also affects our culture, Ven. Thera said.
Further, Ven. thera said the hospital was constructed in 1984 with the Japanese funds was then agreed to treat the clergy free of charge.
Therefore Ven. thera requested from the President to withdraw the circular immediately.(Thilanka Kanakarathna)

JVP to seek legal advice on Cabinet reshuffle
	
A proper interpretation is needed from legal experts to determine the validity of today's Cabinet reshuffle as it is questionable whether it has gone beyond the provisions set out in the 19th Amendment to the Constitution, the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) said today.
JVP leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake told a media briefing that his party would seek legal advice on this matter.
He said according to the 19th Amendment, the Cabinet had to be limited to 48 with 45 deputy ministers but however, the number of Cabinet portfolios had exceeded 48.
We will consult our lawyers to find out whether the limit is based on the number of ministers in the Cabinet or on the number of posts, Mr Dissanayake said adding that a reshuffle would serve no purpose because what was needed was a policy change.
He said the President had told the new ministers that the reshuffle would generate new expectations but new expectations could be fulfilled only through a policy shift.
"If the reshuffle was done to fulfil the peoples expectations of getting rid of corrupt politicians, then former finance minister Ravi Karunanayake should have been removed while Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe who is responsible for covering up the bond issue, Agriculture Minister Duminda Dissanayake who is responsible for wasting millions of rupees on the ministry office, Arjuna Ranatunga who is alleged to be connected to deals in the Port and Ranjith Siyambalapitiya who is alleged to be connected to the controversial coal purchase deal should not be allowed to remain in the Cabinet, Mr. Dissanayake said.
This reshuffle he said is aimed at satisfying some persons in the government and to make it in tact till 2020. (Yohan Perera)

KP exposes how MGR and Indira Gandhi supported LTTE
	
Former prominent Liberation Tigers of Eelam (LTTE) leader Kumaran Pathmanathan, who was the chief international financier and helped smuggle weapons for the terror outfit, spoke to WION in an exclusive interview. KP, as he was known, took over leadership of the LTTE following the death of Velupillai Prabhakaran and was wanted in India in connection with Rajiv Gandhis assassination.
Ironically, as KP revealed, it was Rajiv Gandhis mother Indira Gandhi who asked RAW to aid LTTE. In his heydays, KP was a reclusive, overseas financier for the LTTE based in Thailand and avoided capture by constantly changing addresses and aliases. He would later repent and become an orphanage father.
He also revealed that former Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Marudur Gopalan Ramachandran, popularly known as MGR, supplied the terror outfit with money.
KP was the subject of a worldwide manhunt, with organisations including the CIA and MI-5 on his tail.
He is believed to possess crucial information about the LTTEs vast international assets. A former CBI inspector, who took voluntary retirement in 1997, had alleged that the explosives used in the assassination of Rajiv Gandhi were sent to Chennai from Singapore by KP.
