A costly mansion at no cost
	

An affluent purohita holding a key portfolio in yahapalanaya is said to be putting up a big mansion in the Jayawardhanapura area.

The mansion is estimated to cost a whopping Rs. 200 million. However, funding is no problem for the purohita as practically all building materials are being supplied gratis by some businessmen, they say.
Two container loads of floor tiles of a variety considered most expensive in the world market had been unloaded at the construction site quite recently.
This tile consignment is said to be a gift from a business tycoon who has planned to set up two large factories in the country, they say.
Some privy to inside information say that what beats them is the audacity of this bigwig to have underhand dealings with the very people whom he condemned once as the care-takers of the former royal familys assets in the
mid-east.

Among my Souvenirs: Then and now
	
One day while tidying my cupboard, I found myself holding a bit of paper, discoloured and moth- eaten around the edges. On closer inspection, I discovered that it was a receipt issued to me, over half a century ago. Memories came flooding back, as I recalled the past. 
I was in my late twenties and I was expecting my second baby, which according to the doctor, was going to be a big baby. Since our first-born was a daughter, we hoped the second would be a boy. I thought I would have a difficult time delivering the baby. Ultrasound scans were unheard of in those far off days and I couldnt remember hearing of Caesarean births. 
Monday, September 26, was Mr. S.W.R.D. Bandaranaikes first death anniversary. There was a religious function to bestow merit on him, at the school where I taught. I took part in all the activities and came home feeling rather exhausted. The following day, I was admitted to the Nursing Home. It was a relatively quiet afternoon. The Nursing Home was very homely and comfortable and one of the best in Colombo. In the evening, I was asked to go for a long walk. I remember walking the whole length of the Galle Face Green with my husband and sister-in-law on either side. The Galle Face Green was tranquil and serene in those far-off days and I managed to walk from one end to the other. 
Back in hospital the doctor was given a call. When my doctor, Dr. Daniel arrived it was rather late at night. We were shocked when the doctor delivered the baby and exclaimed, Theres another one on the way!. With no history of twins in either of our families, we just couldnt believe our ears. They were healthy, beautiful, bonny baby girls with perfectly formed features weighing six lbs. and seven lbs. and born just 4 minutes apart. Our first-born was thrilled to have two sisters. Visitors to the hospital were curious to see the young mother and twins, and I had an endless stream of visitors. 
Back at home after six days in hospital we were wondering how we were going to cope with two babies. If one baby meant sleepless nights just imagine getting up, to feed two. I had only six weeks maternity leave to adapt to life with the twins. It was a difficult time for us, but domestic help was freely available in those far-off days. My family members were of immense help to us. 
That little faded piece of paper, I found among my souvenirs brought back fond memories, but what prompted me to write this piece, was to compare the good old days with the present times. My stay in a nursing home for six days, cost me only Rs.375 for the entire period. Unbelievable but true! The doctors charge for delivering the twins was Rs.125, room charges were Rs.20 a day, admission fee was Rs.15, obstetric fee was Rs.35, cost of drugs Rs.69 and lab examination fees Rs.2. 
I gave a call to my granddaughter to find out how much she had spent when she had her baby two years ago. She said that since it was a normal birth, she had stayed in hospital only for one day. Her one day stay in a private hospital in Colombo had cost her Rs.111,900 of which Rs.71,000 was for professional charges. It was astonishing to see how rates had sky-rocketed over the years. 
Thinking back, I marvel at the changes the passing of years have brought. There never, ever will be a time, like the times people of my generation knew.

CB bond issue probe: MR's blunder led to gazette notice mix-up: Rajitha
	
It was a blunder by former president and then finance minister Mahinda Rajapaksa that led to the ongoing controversy in the dates and the issuance of the gazette notification connected to the bond issue, Cabinet Spokesman and Minister Rajitha Senaratne said today.
He told the weekly Cabinet news briefing that until 2012, the finance ministers had signed all the gazette notices on the issuance of Treasury Bonds but from 2013 onward this system had not been carried out.
What the government has done from 2013 was to issue a single gazette notice on the issuance of bonds and the total number of funds raised through them by violating the Act that governs the bond issue. The Central Bank officials have also done a mistake by failing to change the name of the finance minister who signed the relevant gazette notices after January 8, 2015 in the wake of the change of government and the finance minister. That is how former president Mahinda Rajapaksas name entered the gazette notice issued after the regime change, the minister said.
"In one instance a former governor had refused to sign on the relevant document because the gazette notice had the approval of former finance minister Rajapaksa. In November 2016, officials had sent the gazette notice bearing the name of former finance Minister to the government printer."
He said the truth about the controversy would be revealed after the Commission of Inquiry concludes its investigation into the CB bond scam. (Sandun A Jayasekera)

Ceylinco Insurance records strong growth in 4Q , FY16
	

Ceylinco Insurance PLC, which runs Sri Lankas market leading life insurance business based on gross written premiums (GWPs), recorded earnings of Rs.87.19 a share or Rs.2.3 billion for the December quarter (4Q16), up 38 percent year-on-year (YoY), the interim financial accounts showed.
The GWPs of both life and non life for the quarter rose 9 percent YoY to Rs.8.3 billion while the insurance group paid claims and benefits amounting to Rs.3.44 billion.
Meanwhile, for the year ended December 31, 2016 (FY16), the insurance group recorded earnings of Rs.171.28 a share or Rs.4.5 billion, up 29 percent YoY.
The GWPs for both segments rose 14 percent YoY to Rs.31.8 billion. The total claims and benefits paid stood at 13.3 billion, up 14 percent.
Ceylinco General Insurance Managing Director Patrick Alwis said the sharp increase in claim settlement is a result of the large number of claims paid during the floods in May 2016.
Claims were paid within a period of 14 days, enabling our customers to return to normalcy in the fastest possible time. Some customers had only insured their vehicles, but not their homes, while some had insured their shops, but not their houses.
However, Ceylinco General Insurance, looking at the situation from a humane angle, decided to pay a percentage to compensate the damages to their homes as well, he added.
The groups life insurance segment reported an after-tax profit of Rs.2.95 billion for the year on a premium income of Rs.15 billion, which rose 11.7 percent YoY
The general insurance segments after-tax profit stood at Rs.1.3 billion on a premium income of Rs.16.1 billion, which rose 18.9 percent YoY. 
As the clear market dominator, and consolidating its leadership position further for the 13th consecutive year, Ceylinco Insurance sector, in 2016, remained far ahead of the competition, Ceylinco Insurance PLC Managing Director Ajith Gunawardena said in a statement.
Referring to its performance, Ceylinco Life Insurance Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer R. Renganathan, said, In 2016 we embarked on a huge market expansion programme once again. Not only Ceylinco Life but the entire life insurance industry benefited through this.
As at December 13, 2016 Global Rubber Industries (Private) Limited held 22.25 percent stake in Ceylinco, followed by Banque Pictet & Cie SA with a 12.73 percent stake.

D.R. Wijewardene Memorial Panel discussion Dissecting online anonymity, fake news and online hate
	
At the turn of the Twentieth Century, Ceylons struggle for independence had rippled across the length and breadth of the island with an unwavering vision to break the chains of colonial servitude. While there were many who travelled to the far corners of the island to gather support for this struggle, there was a man who believed in the power of the written word that originated from the editorials of Lake House  to explain the worth of self-rule to the common people.

The late D.R. Wijewardene, founder of the Associated Newspapers of Ceylon Ltd. is remembered as a man who worked among minds. Few can match the influence he had over the course of the island nations history. He understood that the media was inseparable from the strength of the nation and that democracy is dependent on the quality of information the people receive. 
The D. R. Wijewardene memorial panel discussion was held at the Lakshman Kadiragamar Institute of International Relations and Strategic Studies, as the nation celebrated the 131st birth anniversary of the press magnate. Organisers of the event noted that D.R. Wijewardene laid the foundation for Sri Lankas independence by understanding that the 20th Century would be redefined by the media. In keeping with his pioneering principles, the discussion explored the present dangers of online anonymity, fake news and online hate with contributions from the countrys leading media institutions, Lake House and Wijeya Newspapers together with online media platforms Ground Views, Yamu and Aniwa.lk. 
Finding a balance in sensationalism, catchy headlines and the need to break news fast with accuracy was among the key challenges explored throughout the evening. The panelists included several editors of digital media platforms, entrepreneurs and journalists who attempted to tackle the grey areas of integrity in online journalism. The panelists included Rasika Jayakody from Lake House, Raisa Wickrematunga from Ground Views, Umair Wolid from Wijeya Newspapers, Indi Samarajiva from Yamu and Anisha Yasarathne of Aniwa.lk. 
Fact and fiction
Discussing misleading news, click-bait and media bias, Rasika Jayakody attempted to differentiate fake news from bad journalism. When we started journalism there were two views; news and not news. News goes to the paper and not news will be left out. There was misinformation, disinformation, fabricated stories, cooked up stuff, all with elements of bad journalism. Today there is a new entity called fake news especially in the light of the US election. What differentiates fake news from bad journalism is the intent and the style of publishing, Jayakody opined. 
In our newsrooms we try we try our best to get news right because we dont want mistakes. Our intention is to get it right and there are various bodies and frameworks to monitor these. Fake news [ articles] do not have frameworks. They [publishers] know in very clear terms that their purpose is the clear factor. Their objective is to use fake news to earn money, more hits or to aid some campaign, he added. 
Jayakody cited examples of fake news with stories such as Donald Trump being endorsed by the Pope in the run to the US Presidential Election. He also spoke of the more recent news that US changed its VISA accreditation on Sri Lanka. According to Jayakody these stories define fake news. 
One hundred years ago D. R. Wijewardene had the required amount of capital to start a large scale publishing company. Now the manufacturing cost of news and information has gone down to zero. Everyone is a publisher at least on social media. There is a huge influx of fake news online and we cant do anything about it. We need to single out fake news from bad journalism, he said. 
Speaking further on the distinction between fake news and news that is inaccurate Umair Wolid of Wijeya Newsapapers spoke of how private media entities confront the new financial rival that that is fake news. According to Wolid fake news dissemination happens in two ways. While some stories are published purely with financial or political intent, some are the result of poor fact checking. 
The US visa story, was picked up by Sri Lankan websites which said that Sri Lankans could travel visa free to the US. That was pure fake news. Its intent was not to pull out the fake news but it displayed a lack of fact checking. This is a common issue in any media institution. The entire news industry is so competitive because everyone wants to break their news first. There is no excuse for journalism sans fact checking. It is becoming a major issue at the moment. Paying news vs. false news are actually two dilemmas that modern journalists need to worry about, Wolid said. 
Threat to democracy
Following these remarks the panelists were then questioned if there are instances where fake news can be good or useful. In response to the question, Indi Samarajiva of Yamu, an online media presence that sparked heated debate for its content on social media recently  took a rather unusual stance on the subject. He declared that fake news is not necessarily bad as often portrayed. 
If you have a weapon, you dont ask if the weapon is real or not, you just ask if it is effective. If media is a weapon and you need to get what you want, then why not make it fake Fake news allows a lot of people into the media establishment. Even now you need capital to have a media organisation. With access to a web server many people can be reached, Samarajiva said adding that alternative media outlets empowered the disenfranchised to voice their opinions. 
However Raisa Wickrematunge of Groundviews countered this argument in response to the questions posed if fake news was a danger to democracy. I think its interesting that you think fake news is a stone that could be thrown at the establishment. When Ive written about the media I have often said that its like youre holding an unexploded grenade. And you are not aware of the power you wield. That might be an interesting analogy. Having said that, fake news also has a negative impact. Wickrematunge then went on to narrate a personal encounter in 2012 where she was a victim of fake news. In 2012 an article written by Wickrematunge had been picked up by another news outlet. The cooked up story had evolved into a news report alleging that she had been arrested. Wickrematunge notes that whenever her name is Googled, one of the things that appear in the results page is a false report of her arrest. 
When you dont verify things it does have an impact on people. While for me this is an interesting anecdote, there are instances where it negatively impacted peoples lives. For instance in November there were two unarmed university students shot dead by police in Jaffna. One newspaper said that they were driving banned motorcycles, with the hope this somehow excused what happened. This was then picked up by several news organisations who reported it without fact checking. Imagine the feelings of the families of the victims when they saw this news. It is important to note that when you dont verify things it can have a negative impact on peoples lives, she cautioned. 
Not the news
The panelists went on to discuss the willingness of an editorial team to balance sensationalism and reporting the truth. Anisha Yasaratne of Aniwa.lk said that reports are mostly formulated from the point of view from individual media organisations whose abilities are often restricted. 
If your goal is to be a sustainable media organisation I dont think that you can push the envelope too far when youre crafting your click-bait for a website. When you draft your headlines and taglines, you would be doing yourselves a disservice if you dont represent the content of your article in the headline itself. In the Sinhala media space, if you dont do news youre automatically cast into the gossip sphere which is very veracious. It is also a necessity to be a little extreme these days because youre competing with so many other publications. You have to balance this with the truth. If you dont youre not going to last too long, he said. 
The panelists went on to explore the restrictions and limitations media could and should draw in reporting with sensationalism and questioned as to where the lines could be drawn. While the audience could not clearly comprehend a conclusive account through the question and answer session at the end of the discussion a number of interesting queries were posed by the audience. This included the redaction of popular names and the selection of editorial content by each media organisation. However the panelists were firm in their stance that when questioning peoples identities and religion through reports of the media must be approached with caution and calls for better preparation for the reactions it may cause.

Gota controlled underworld activities: Gammanpila
	
The Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) yesterday charged that there should be brave leaders like former defence secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa to control the underworld activities.
PHU General Secretary MP Udaya Gammanpila told a media briefing that the underworld activities have now been awaken again during the past two years, unlike in the period of the former government.
The underworld activities are usually carried out in any country with the assistance of a political aide. The situation is also the same in Sri Lanka. But during the former government the incidents of underworld activities were rare since Mr. Rajapaksa has handled them in a politically unbiased manner, he said. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)

His attributes for the high post challenged
	

The high posts committee of the Diyawanna council had asked a head of a certain government statutory body connected to marine transport to appear before it following a number of complaints that the latter did not possess even the elementary qualifications for the post he was holding.

Every time the head of the authority was asked to appear before the committee, the latter had been informed that the man was abroad.
This worthy had been playing truant thus emboldened by the fact that the statutory body he heads comes under the Ministry held by a family member, informed ones say.
A long -looked for  day dawned for the JO members as well as the white collar high-ups of the statutory body who were mainly behind the complaints when the elusive head had recently appeared before the committee. The outcome of this decisive inquiry is due to be announced shortly, they say.

Indias vicarious involvement in Sri Lankas Tamil Question Merge the North and East or not
	
Man is like a rope: both break at a definite strainthe solution is not splicing the rope; its lessening the tension. 
~Jack Vance 
We may need Indias backing in the international arena in time to come. We may need Indias help to persuade the more extreme elements in the Tamil leadership to adhere to this and reject that. We may need Indias support to sustain a more enduring peace, not as it is today- a mere absence of war and militancy- we might even need Indias wholehearted patronage to convince world leaders not to interfere with our internal political matters at all. Yet when, as per Indian Express of February 20, 2017, Indias Foreign Secretary stated; India will not be pressing Sri Lanka to merge the Northern and Eastern Provinces to form a single Tamil-majority, Tamil-speaking province as envisaged by the India-Sri Lanka Accord of 1987, India has willy-nilly assured Sri Lanka and its Muslim community some lasting respite-that the merger issue, as it is called now, would be in the back burner, at least for some time. 
The Indo-Sri Lanka Peace Accord was signed in Colombo on 29 July 1987 by Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi and Sri Lankan President J. R. Jayewardene. The primary purpose of the accord was to resolve the Sri Lankan civil war by enabling the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution of Sri Lanka and the Provincial Councils Act of 1987. While its opponents condemned the accord as a sell-out to the Indian-backed Tamils and their militant leaders, its supporters promulgated that it was the bedrock on which the whole socio-ethnic relations rested.
Among the significant points of the agreement, the Sri Lankan Government made a number of concessions to Tamil demands, which included, among others, devolution of power from Colombo to the provinces, merger (subject to later referendum) of the Northern and Eastern provinces and official status for the Tamil language.
What irked most of the Sinhala chauvinists was the merger, of the Northern and Eastern provinces into one-not proposed but one which became a fait accompli after the signatures of Gandhi and Jayawardene were placed. Although it was worded as subject to a referendum to be held later only in the Eastern Province, the pronouncement of the merger stood between these two provinces as from the date the accord was signed. 
R. Hariharan writing a column to The Hindu in July 2010, almost an year after the crushing blow dealt to the Tamil militants led by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Elam (LTTE) and Prabhakaran, opines thus:The Rajiv-Jayawardene Accord was perhaps too ambitious in its scope as it sought to collectively address all the three contentious issues between India and Sri Lanka:strategic interests,people of Indian origin in Sri Lanka and Tamil minority rights in Sri Lanka. Its success depended on sustained political support from both countries. So the accord got sidelined when political leaders who were unhappy with it came to power in both countries almost at the same time. As a result, Tamil minorities, who had put their faith in it, were in limbo. These unsavory developments have clouded the understanding of the positive aspects of the accord. After all, it was the accord that enabled Sri Lankan Tamils to gain recognition for some of their demands in Sri Lankan politics and in the Sri Lankan Constitution. 
A lot of water has passed under the proverbial bridge since Hariharan wrote his piece. It is eight years since the end of the war for Sri Lanka. The political leadership in Sri Lanka has changed from one of family-driven to a more dilute one among non-family members. Yet the Joint Opposition whose only raison dtre seems to be the protection and safeguarding of their loot, once again is raising the racial cry. Race and religion, as against any other social factor, have collectively determined the course any country takes in order to preserve its sovereignty on the one hand and the kind of government it wants to have on the other. It is in this context that the merger-issue needs more and more attention from our leaders. However unpalatable for the Tamil leadership, de-merger of the North and East should remain off the table. Merger of the North and East is not negotiable as much as a separate state of Elam was. 
The Tamil leadership in Sri Lanka cannot and should not disregard the overwhelming numbers and their influence of the Muslim population in the East. A merger of these two provinces would give the Tamils in the North a decided advantage and hereby subjugate a people, Muslims, who have been living in Sinhalese areas as cohabitants for centuries. The leadership of the Muslim communities from pre-independence to date have been embedded in our national issues, from the schools takeover to economic suppression to getting rid of a would-be-dictatorial rule of the Rajapaksa family. The Muslim communitys involvement at grassroots level is total and their marriage at the level of politics supersedes that which came from the Tamils. Nevertheless, the current leadership of the Tamils, as it is ostensibly limited to the Tamil National Alliance (TNA), is mainly represented by Sampanthan at the center and Wignesvaran in the Northern Province. More often than not, both Sampanthan and Wignesvaran seem to be at loggerheads. They might be united under the banner of the merger of the Northern and Eastern provinces, but the narratives that cascade from the respective lips tend to go in different directions. Wignesvaran seems to adopt a more belligerent stance and Sampanthan is opting for a more diplomatic path. 
In the meantime, both President Sirisena and Prime Minister Wickremasinghe, as opposed to the leaders of the previous regime, are fervently trying to float a reconciliation-oriented policy between the two peoples and their leaderships. One great reason for success at the last Presidential Election of Maithripala Sirisena was the great proactive stance taken by President Sirisena who is more akin to Chandrika Kumaranatunge than the nationalist Rajapaksas. Treading dangerously along this reconciliation path is not enough. The danger dwells in its un-appealability to the self-driven emotions of the majority Sinhalese Buddhists. Convincing the Tamil leadership on the unsuitability and futility of a merger between the North and East coupled with maintaining extremely profound and sincere relationship with the Muslim leadership are a twofold path the current Sinhalese leadership has to follow. 
We are today in the midst of pitiful statements and articles by ex-President Mahinda Rajapaksa. So far only Anura Kumara Dissanayake, the leader of the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) has responded convincingly and compellingly to these ludicrous Rajapaksa utterances However, it is in the earnest and vested interests of the Rajapaksas and their cohorts to paint a picture of appeasing a regime that has no inner strength to forcefully segregate the Tamils from mainstream Sri Lanka. The word segregation has not entered into the local vocabulary in the context of racial relationships. But it is a word that must be used in all our communications and narratives. 
In 1963, June, American President John Kennedy made his famous Civil Rights Address. Some parts of that speech still resonate today: This is one country. It has become one country because all of us and all the people who came here had an equal chance to develop their talents. We cannot say to ten per cent of the population that you cant have that right; that your children cannot have the chance to develop whatever talents they have; that the only way that they are going to get their rights is to go in the street and demonstrate. I think we owe them and we owe ourselves a better country than that. 
The lesson that we Sri Lankans, especially Sinhalese Buddhists, need to take is that although the Northern Tamils account for less than 10%, they have the same rights that any Sinhalese Buddhists who constitute nearly 70% of the population have. If we cannot safeguard the rights of a smaller number we simply cannot safeguard the rights of a larger number. It may be extremely difficult to drive in such positive social dynamics down the throats of a segment of our society who have been conditioned over the centuries on negative bases by political leaders who have been on the fringes of social thinking. But those fringes became the mainstream after 1956. That is another reality we have to deal with today, not tomorrow or day after, but today.

Is it the start of a state-run violent era JO asks
	
The Joint Opposition expressed concern yesterday over the Mondays horrific shooting in Kalutara and said they wondered whether the incident was a precursor to a state-run violent era similar to the 88-89 insurgency.
JO national organiser, MP Dullas Alahapperuma said that, for the first time in history, a gang of underworld figures clad in police uniforms had attacked a prisons bus and killed five suspects and two prisons officers.
This is horrendous. During the previous governments tenure, underworld figures left the country. As soon as the new government came to power they returned. In fact a government politician is behind the return of the thugs who left the country, he alleged at a media briefing. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Is something cooking
	

The former strongman spent a few days in Lion City recently. Reports said that he was on a visit to the city nation for medical consultation and treatment.

Meanwhile, Number Two in yahapalanaya who too was on a foreign tour had a stop-over in Lion City on his way back home while the former strongman was still there taking treatment.
Incidentally, there was a story doing rounds that Number Two had a one-on-one meeting with the former strongman while they were in Lion City. However, this story remains unconfirmed.
Meanwhile, reliable sources say that it is a fact that a certain powerful purohita hailing from the South, often in and out of the palace, had a lengthy exchange with the former strongman at a well-known cricket club in Lion City.
The duo had reportedly discussed a number of key issues of national significance. However, the contents of this discussion remain a secret so far.

Land and Police powers should be given to NP -- Rathana Thera
	
Land and Police powers should be given to the people of the Northern Province, said MP Athuraliye Rathana Thera yesterday.
Addressing the inaugural conference of the Sri Lanka National Council, he said that some MPs were constantly claiming to make a new Constitution to resolve the National issue -- which they define as Northern peoples land issues and Tamil speaking police in their areas.
We, too, agree on giving land and police powers to the Northern community. A national policy should be adopted before the lands are given, as the poor deserve the lands, not the politicians nor any other wealthy men who claim them, he said.
The Thera said that though former Prime Minister D S Senanayake had distributed Mahaweli lands, no other politician had done anything similar.
He also said that the armed forces should be kept under the Central Government and administrative powers could easily be transferred to the North.
Instead of the khaki uniformed colonialist police personnel in High Security Zones, we could simply deploy police officers clad in white uniforms in the Northern areas without firearms. The war is over. Therefore we can give the Tamil people a police force with civil administrative powers, he said.
He said that there was no need of policemen carrying weapons in the North, as they were only needed to prevent thefts and other minor offences.
Meanwhile, he said that the issues which were being highlighted in parliament to satisfy few persons could be resolved easily without going in for a referendum or changing the Constitution -- which would waste more time and money.(Thilanka Kanakarathna)

More lunch packets than attendees at the function
	

Number One in yahapalanaya paid an official visit to Uva to inaugurate a big development project in the province.

A big-mouthed purohita from Uva who was lucky enough to make it to Diyawanna despite losing at the polls was in charge of organizing the important event and had wanted to make use of the occasion to showcase the extent of his popularity. So he had made all preparations to ensure a good turnout at the inaugural ceremony of the project and got about 3,500 lunch packets ready for distributing to the people attending it.
However, the turnout at the event turned out to be a severe disappointment for the purohita for it hardly accounted for half the number of lunch packets available for distribution. So the purohitas wife had generously offered the participants two or three lunch packets each.
The purohitas supporters who were involved in distributing the lunch packets, in a bid to dispose of the excess in a hurry had sent a number of parcels to a political office of a member of the former royal family, now an arch political rival of the purohita.
The employees of the political office who had been feeling of the pangs of hunger at the time had thankfully accepted the lunch parcels,they say.

As soon as the Right to Information Act came into operation, a certain NGO had sought the details relating to the assets and liabilities of several yahapalanaya heavyweights.

By the way, there were allegations in the recent past that this NGO committed to bringing about transparency in all government affairs, was not carrying out their own affairs in a transparent manner.
The yahapalanaya bigwigs who were livid over the cheeky request had reportedly given the NGO chaps a tongue- lashing asking them to put their own house in order first and to get whatever information they wanted from the Polls commission.

NITF procures reinsurance cover for agriculture insurance
	
State-owned National Insurance Trust Fund has concluded the procurement of a reinsurance programme for its agricultural insurance schemes.
Two global giants, Hannover Re (50 percent) and Swiss Re (40 percent) have together accepted a 90 percent share of the programme with 3 other global reinsurers sharing the balance 10 percent. The placement was made through J.B. Boda & Co (S) Pte Ltd, a leading reinsurance broker, selected after a competitive procurement process.
This reinsurance programme will provide support to agricultural insurance schemes funded by NITF including the recently launched National Agricultural Loan Protection Scheme. The cover has been arranged on a stop loss basis which is typically the method adopted to obtain reinsurance for agricultural insurance.
NITF Chairman Manjula de Silva said that NITF is delighted to welcome Hannover Re and Swiss Re to its network of reinsurers which already includes the likes of Munich Re and Allianz SE. NITF CEO Sanath de Silva added Having the backing of strong reinsurers will supplement the financial strength and stability of NITF to withstand external shocks we have to deal with due to volatile climatic conditions.
NITF is rated AA  (lka) by Fitch Rating and is the fourth largest contributor to the government treasury among state owned enterprises.

President Maithripala Sirisena said today that he would not participate in the opening of the newly built Prison Facility known as Super Prison in Angunukolapelessa, Hambantota scheduled to be opened on March 16.
The President made the above remarks at a ceremony held today to celebrate the 150th Anniversary of the St. Marys College in Kegalle.
He said a lot of money had been spent on the prison that was built with many facilities.
He said that even though he had received invitation to declare the facility open, he declined it because rather than opening a prison it was worth to open a school, which would provide education to children.
We should build a country, which opens schools and closes prisons. We should also build a country where people are healthy, and the number of hospitals minimised, he added.
President Sirisena said that the country was crammed with prisons and indecent people. He said that criminals were growing in numbers with society becoming very competitive. 
He recalled the statement of late American Baptist Minister and Social Activist Martin Luther King, The greatest tragedy of this period of social transition was not the strident clamour of the bad people, but the appalling silence of the good people and said that intellectuals and great persons should be born more and more in this country to suppress the strident clamour of the bad people.

Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne has committed a crime by importing Rs.1, 500 million worth of vaccinations which are detrimental to cancer patients putting their lives at risk, the joint opposition said today.
It said the vaccinations had been imported by violating tender procedures.
The JO said the vaccine Taxacad known as Hearticad in Sri Lanka was a product of Russian-based BIOCAD Biotechnology Company and that the vaccinations had rejected by the Sri Lanka College of Oncologists (SLCO).
This product has been rejected as it is not in common use in other countries and known to be detrimental to cancer patients. This medicine has only been introduced recently and needs more tests to be carried out before being released to the market, JO MP Ranjith de Zoysa told a news briefing.
After the news briefing, the JO lodged a complaint with the Bribery Commission against the Health Minister over the alleged misappropriation.
This was the ninth complaint made by the JO under its Top Ten Yahapalana Mega thieves investigation programme. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

## Title: SpaceX Plans to Send 2 Tourists Around Moon in 2018
## Section: World News - Main

SpaceX Plans to Send 2 Tourists Around Moon in 2018
	
The SpaceX CEO, Elon Musk, revealed on Monday that two people have paid for a private mission around the moon, tentatively set for launch in 2018 with the private companys yet untested Falcon Heavy rocket.
In a conference call with reporters, Musk declined to name the people or what they had paid, though he said the individuals know each other and are very serious about the flight. The private citizens approached the company late last year and will receive training and take health and fitness tests as early as this year.
Musk said the circumlunar journey would take about a week, nearing the moons surface without landing on it before its return to Earth. The total flight would go about 300,000 to 400,000 miles into space, he said, meaning the flight could take humans farther from Earth than ever before.
If SpaceX accomplishes the trip before Nasa or another space agency can send astronauts to the moon, it would be the first lunar mission with humans in 45 years, on a course that would extend past the record 249,000 miles traveled by the Apollo 13 astronauts in 1970.

SpaceX said in a statement that the would-be passengers have already paid a significant deposit to do a moon mission, and Musk called the cost comparable to that of sending astronauts to the International Space Station. Nasa currently pays Russias space agency, Roscosmos, about $70m a person to fly astronauts to the ISS.
Other flight teams have also expressed strong interest and we expect more to follow, the company statement read. Additional information will be released about the flight teams, contingent upon their approval and confirmation of the health and fitness test results.
The flight would rely on SpaceXs Falcon Heavy rocket, the massive engine that the company hopes to test for the first time this summer, and a Dragon 2 capsule. Musk said that the capsule had a quite high success rate for missions so far.
The passengers were nobody from Hollywood, Musk said.
He acknowledged that the flight would be dangerous but said the customers have their eyes open about what could happen. Were doing everything we can to minimize that risk, but its not zero, Musk said.
We would expect to do more than one mission of this nature, he added.
While Nasa has contracted SpaceX to launch crewed missions to the International Space Station, the company has not yet flown any missions with humans. Musk said the space agency would receive priority if it decided to do another lunar mission first, and that the private trip would need a license from the Federal Aviation Administration. Nasas acting administrator, Robert Lightfoot, has said that the agency is reviewing a possible return to the moon or a flight into deep space beyond it.
The company will test its Crew Dragon spacecraft without humans on board later this mission and is scheduled to fly a crewed mission to the space station in 2018.
In its 15-year history, SpaceX and its founder have accrued a steady record of ambitious goals and blown deadlines. In 2011, Musk said that SpaceX would be ready to fly its first manned mission in 2014. That same year, he told the Wall Street Journal that he hoped to take humans to Mars by 2021 in a best case scenario, an estimate that he pushed back to 2024 last year. And though SpaceX has launched and landed eight reusable rockets, it has also suffered setbacks of failed landings and last years launchpad explosion that destroyed the expensive rocket and its satellite payload.
Earlier this month, the Government Accountability Office warned of safety concerns in a review of SpaceXs rockets and plans, suggesting that there are more delays ahead. The report noted that both SpaceX and another private contractor, United Launch Alliance, have consistently failed to meet deadlines.
Musk remained optimistic on the call, saying, Next year is going to be the big year for carrying people.
In a statement, Nasa said it commends its industry partners for reaching higher.
We will work closely with SpaceX to ensure it safely meets the contractual obligations to return the launch of astronauts to US soil and continue to successfully deliver supplies to the International Space Station, the agency said.
The company currently flies cargo missions to the ISS in a Dragon capsule, and successfully launched and landed its eighth reusable Falcon 9 rocket, part of a fleet that Musk hopes will help usher in an era of easier, relatively cheap space travel.
In its statement, SpaceX said that Nasa has encouraged privately crewed missions, saying that through them long-term costs to the government decline and more flight reliability history is gained, benefiting both government and private missions.
Only after crewed missions have begun for Nasa, SpaceX said, will the company launch its mission around the moon, from the Cape Canaveral launchpad used by the Apollo program. This presents an opportunity for humans to return to deep space for the first time in 45 years and they will travel faster and further into the Solar System than any before them, the company said.
Rival spaceflight company Blue Origins, headed by the Amazon CEO, Jeff Bezos, has also announced plans to eventually take people and cargo to low Earth orbit with its own reusable rockets. In 2001, billionaire Dennis Tito became the worlds first space tourist for an estimated $20m, booking a trip on a Russian Soyuz spacecraft to the International Space Station, and about half a dozen others followed him into orbit.

When the Divulapitiya Divisional coordinating committee meeting was in session yesterday, an argument between the Deputy Minister of Social Empowerment and Social Welfare Ranjan Ramanayake and Gampaha District MP Indika Anuruddha grew so tense that the meeting had to be abruptly adjourned.
The meeting had commenced yesterday with the Co-chairmen of the committee presiding. The controversial Divisional Secretary Ms H.M.L.S. Herath was also present. When the Deputy Minister Ramanayake questioned the OIC of Kotadeniyawa Police Inspector D.D. Wickramasinghe about an incident involving a soil excavation in Waradala, MP Indika Anuruddha had mentioned about a petition received by the committee on the same matter where after obtaining permit for excavation of 500 cubes, 60,000 cubes had been excavated.
This led to arguments and counter arguments and slating each other using improper language. When the hurling of abuse became so severe and the temper of the duo rising higher, supporters of both parties and the security personnel stood up to separate them. However, the arguments continued for about 45 minutes and the Director of Planning Ms Asha Siriwardene declared the meeting as adjourned.

The Cabinet has approved the payment of compensation to the next of kin of 16 inmates who were killed and the 11 injured during the Welikada prison riots on November 9, 2012.
The Cabinet paper was submitted by Prison Reforms, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Minister D.M. Swaminathan on the recommendation of the sub committee which probed the prison riots. A payment of Rs.2,000,000 will be paid to the next of kin of 16 prisoners who died and Rs.500,000 each of those who were injured.
The sub committee said it was unnecessary to pay compensation to the 11 prisoners who were killed when attempting to escape from jail.
The Government has decided to gazette the procurement guidelines and instructions issued by the Ministry of Finance from time to time on the governments procurement procedure through the National Procurement Commission to accelerate the process.
The Cabinet memo presented by President Maithripala Sirisena also includes new time frames to be followed on Cabinet-approved Procurement Guidelines and update or amend procurement guidelines by paying attention on new trends such as e-procurement and a general construction plan on designing and funds to provide technical skills to government officers on the procurement procedure.
