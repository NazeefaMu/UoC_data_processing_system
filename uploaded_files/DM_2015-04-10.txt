Ceylinco Peoples Insurance Brand of the Year again
	
Sri Lankans young and old voted Ceylinco Insurance their undisputed choice yet again, by selecting Ceylinco as the Peoples Insurance Brand of the Year at Peoples Awards 2015, for an unprecedented ninth consecutive time.
Bestowed the honour of being the distinct leader in the insurance industry in Sri Lanka once again, Ceylinco Insurance has not missed a beat since the commencement of the POP Award, as it is popularly called, winning every time, confirming its position at the very zenith, as the most preferred insurer, in the sphere of insurance in Sri Lanka.
The Sri Lanka Institute of Marketing (SLIM), in association with Nielsen Lanka (Pvt.) Ltd, recognise and honour brands that are closest to the hearts and minds of the Sri Lankan people. Since its inception nine years ago, in 2006, the concept of the Peoples Award is unique, in that the Sri Lankans voice their opinion and that they are the primary and only source of deciding who the winners are across brands, organisations and personalities.
Research criteria followed over a period of six months, interviewed over 3,000 consumers, aged between 18 and 50 years. The random sample of people was taken from all provinces islandwide: undoubtedly one of the largest research projects in the country. Therefore, the results arrived at reflect the true voice of Sri Lankans from across communities, regions and social strata.
During 2014, Ceylinco Insurance recorded a premium income of Rs.24.2 billion, to which the General Division contributed Rs.12.2 billion, with the Life Division  contributing Rs.12 billion.
We thank our staff for the undying support and commitment towards providing an exceptional service to our customers. We also thank our customers and the Sri Lankan public for selecting Ceylinco Insurance as their preferred choice. Winning the Peoples Award is truly an honour that we must jointly accept, along with our customers and all Sri Lankans. It is not only the highest recognition in terms of corporate success but also a measurement of the regard we are held in, in the public eye, and how intrinsically linked we are to the Sri Lankan people.
Our customer need led innovations have continually fuelled our success, simultaneously fulfilling the requirements of the Sri Lankan populace. And our unmatched insurance solutions are delivered through our unsurpassed branch network, which spans the entire island, bringing us, inherently closer to our customers, which subsequently ensures our continuing success story, said Ceylinco Insurance General Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer Ajith Gunawardena.
Ceylinco Life had sustained the market leadership for over a decade in the life insurance sector by the end of 2014. This could only have been achieved through the trust of hundreds of thousands of policyholders, who have chosen Ceylinco Life as their life insurance partner. Ours is a long-term partnership built on a foundation of ethics, professionalism and commitment to the protection of our policyholders and their loved ones. It is no surprise therefore that we are the Peoples Insurance Brand of the Year once again, said Ceylinco Life Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer R. Renganathan.

China, Sri Lanka Hold Military Drill
	
China and Sri Lanka have held a joint drill at a comprehensive military training base in southern China to enhance their capabilities, specially in combating terror.
The Chinese People's Armed Police Force (APF) and the Sri Lankan Army held the drill code-named 'Silk Road Cooperation - 2015' in Guangzhou.
The joint drill was aimed at helping both sides to learn from each other, so as to improve their capabilities of performing duties, the Chinese state-run Military Online News reported.
The focus of the drill held on March 29 was on developing anti-terrorist skills and tactical trainings.
The anti-terrorist skills highlight skills of shooting, capturing, and climbing.
The tactical trainings mainly comprise operations of searching blocks, rescuing hostages, as well as anti-hijacking aircraft and buses, said Su Haihui, deputy director of the Training Department of the Chinese APF.
The second phase of the drill between China and Sri Lanka is expected to be held in June this year.
China will send several special operation teams to Sri Lanka to take part in the second phase of the joint drill, the report said.
Sri Lanka under former president Mahinda Rajapaksa's regime has endorsed China sponsored Silk Road and Maritime Silk Road (MSR) initiative for which USD 1.5 billion Colombo Port City project was to provide a key base in the Indian Ocean.
The new government headed by Maithripala Sirisena has kept the project under suspension over concerns relating to environmental clearance and heavy interests rates charged over the loans provided for the Chinese projects. (NDTV)

Confusion over on arrival Visa to India from April 14
	
	Despite Indian Premier Narendra Modis pledge to grant on arrival Indian Visas to Sri Lankan tourists from April 14, confusion reigns over the matter with doubts if it would be implemented from that date.
	When contacted by the Daily Mirror, Colombos Indian High Commission First Secretary Gaurav Ahluwalia said they were yet to receive a response on this matter. I have spoken to my colleagues and I am yet to receive a response. Since this was declared by our Prime Minister I am sure the online visa facility will be launched, he said.
	The first Secretary also said they were working on it and the facility would be available after April 14. Suppose someone wants to visit India on the 15, he or she will have the option of applying for Visa from the 14 onwards. Right now we are working on the back end, he said.
	Another official from the High Commission said Sri Lankans could apply for online visa through the website- www.indianvisaonline.gov.in/visa/tvoa.html and follow the relevant instructions given in that. However, it was found that Sri Lanka was not included in the list of countries eligible to gain on arrival Indian Visas.
	When the Daily Mirror contacted the Department of Immigration and Emigration an official from the visa section said they were not aware of anything regarding on arrival visa to India yet.
	When contacted Deputy Foreign Affairs Minister Ajith. P. Perera also appeared to be uncertain about the situation. I am not familiar with the situation so please contact the Controller of Immigration, he said. (Chathushika Wijeyesinghe)

Pack your bags and leave: BBS tells President
	
The Bodu Bala Sena (BBS) said today President Maithripala Sirisena should pack his bags and leave so as to allow a leader with a backbone to administer the country which was fast heading towards anarchy.
BBS General Secretary Ven. Galagodaaththe Gnanasara Thera told a news conference that the people were confused about political situation which has become a mockery when considering the manner in which some of the politicians are behaving.
The country needs a leader with a backbone and leadership qualities. Mr. Sirisena is a good person. But he is unable to administer the affairs of this country and neither has he been capable of fulfilling the elections promises he made. So we kindly request him to leave, the Thera said.
He said even Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe was a better leader of the country because the decisions taken by President Sirisena had ended in confusion.
The Thera said the countrys current political status was foretold by the BBS several months ago and that the people were disappointed with the so-called change that was definitely destroying governance in Sri Lanka.
This government has not given priority to Buddhism at ceremonies organised by the Government and we have noticed Buddhism and the Sinhala nation are under threat, the Thera said.
BBS Chief Executive Officer Dilantha Vithanage who was also present at the media briefing, accused the Government of hatching a conspiracy by elements behind scene.
The country is a mess. The Prime Minister says one thing while the President and the other leaders are saying something else. This is not what the public expected from the change. We request Mr. Sirisena to take responsibility for the allegations levelled at the government and allow someone else with a strong personality to be the leader, he said.
Speaking on the incident where former President Chandrika Kumaratunga was hooted and jeered at a SLFP meeting, Gnanasara Thera expressed his sorrow at the embarrassment caused but said that was the result of her of performing the 3rd episode of what he described as Ege Wairaya. (Piyumi Fonseka)

Sri Lanka was ranked 88 out of 133 countries in the Social Progress Index conducted by the US-based Social Progress Imperative Organisation, ahead of the neighbouring countries including India and Pakistan.
Sri Lanka ranked at 75 in the Basic Human Needs sub category, 81 at the Foundations of Wellbeing and 95 at the Opportunity sub category.
Sri Lanka performs best on Nutrition and Basic Medical Care and has the most opportunity to improve on the Personal Safety component. The island scores highest on Access to Basic Knowledge but lags behind on the Ecosystem Sustainability component. In the Opportunity Dimension, Sri Lanka is strongest on Personal Freedom and Choice and has the most room to improve on Personal Rights, the index stated.
India is ranked 101 among the 133 countries while Pakistan ranked 122, Afghanistan at the bottom of 133, Bangladesh at 100 and Nepal at 98. Bhutan and Maldives have not been ranked. Norway, Sweden and Switzerland occupied the top three places respectively.

SLFP argument no longer valid: DM
	
The argument by the SLFP and a few other parties which opposed the 19th Amendment if not introduced simultaneously with electoral reforms is no longer valid, because the arbitrary powers of the executive presidency has not been curbed to the extent originally planned, Deputy Foreign Affairs Minister Ajith P. Perera said today.
He told a news briefing that the government had decided to omit certain sections of the 19A draft that would be taken up for debate in Parliament; because the Supreme Court verdict on its constitutionality stated that they required approval at a referendum. 
It is very clearly mentioned in President Sirisenas manifesto that any constitutional amendment that requires a referendum will not be implemented. Therefore, we decided to omit the sections that need a referendum and go ahead with those that can be passed in parliament by a 2/3 majority, the deputy minister said.
He said the original clause that declared the President as the Head of State, the Government, the Executive and the Commander of the tri-forces still exists.
So as you can see, the only curtailing of powers with regard to that clause in 19A is the section which calls for important decisions regarding the appointment of ministers and dissolving Parliament to be carried out in consultation with the Prime Minister. If a situation arises where the President and the PM are in conflict regarding the course of action to be taken, the matter will be referred to Parliament, the deputy minister said.
He said therefore the argument put forward by the SLFP and other parties on having to approve the 19A together with electoral reforms simultaneously was no longer valid because the country has not been destabilized in any way because the powers of the executive presidency have not been curbed to the extent envisaged at first.
The deputy minister said neither the SLFP nor any other party had any grounds, legally or ethically to object to the implementation of the 19A.
I must also mention that the omission of certain clauses has not in any way caused a hindrance to our promise of establishing and strengthening good governance and democracy in the country. Meanwhile, we also recognize the importance of implementing electoral reforms but that will be carried out in due time without haste, he added. (Lakna Paranamanna)

TNA stakes claim for opp. leaders post
	
In the wake of Speaker Chamal Rajapaksa requesting the United People's Freedom Alliance (UPFA) to nominate an MP for the post of opposition leader, the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) with 14 seats in Parliament has written to the Speaker staking its claim for the post.
The letter signed by TNA General Secretary K. Thurairajasingham and Parliamentary Group Leader R Sampanthan states, After the conclusion of the presidential election in January 2015 the UNP Leader has become the Prime Minister and several UNP MPs have been sworn in as Cabinet Ministers constituting the government. The SLFP Leader is the President and a member of the Cabinet (in fact the head of the Cabinet) and several UPFA MPs (in excess of 26) are ministers, some of them in the Cabinet.
Therefore the Government is composed of both the UPFA and the UNP, disentitling both of those parties from occupying the seat of the opposition leader. No member of parliament elected from the UPFA or UNP can be the leader of the oposition. This clearly is the legal position as well as one that accords with parliamentary tradition, both of our country and the Commonwealth. 
The resultant position is that it is the ITAK that is entitled to the post of the opposition leader having 14 members in parliament. The DNA has seven members, one of whom is also a Cabinet Minister now, the letter added.(By Kelum Bandara and Yohan Perera)
