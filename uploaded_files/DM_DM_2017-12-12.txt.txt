A taskmaster or a psychopath
	

There is a lady boss of a government establishment who barks at employees who apply for leave for more than one day, they say.

This fair white collar one appointed as the head of this establishment tasked with collecting revenue for the exchequer, thanks to right political connections, has issued a standing order saying that applications for leave exceeding one day should be submitted to her for approval.
Very often this high-up would rebuke leave applicants saying: Why are you taking so much of leave Remain at home if you are not well enough to work. There are enough people for us to recruit!
Quite recently she railed at an employee who returned to work after sick leave. In fact, he was taken ill while on duty, a fellow employee recalled.

Alleged attack on NUW supporter: Court orders arrest of Thondamans son
	
Hatton Magistrate T. Saravanaraja yesterday ordered the Maskeliya Police to arrest Jeevan Thondaman, the son of CWC General Secretary and Parliamentarian Arumugam Thondaman and produce him in courts regarding an alleged attack on a National Union of Workers (NUW) supporter who had participated in a funeral in Maskeliya.
Police earlier arrested four CWC suspects who had surrendered to the Police over this incident and produced them in courts. The Hatton Magistrate ordered that the case be taken up again on April 4 while releasing the four suspects including the CWC Vice President and Central Provincial Council Minister M. Rameshwaran on cash bail.
The others who were released on bail were Wellayan Dinesh, M. Pichchamoorthy and S. Baskaran.
Maskeliya Police told the Magistrate that another suspect named Jeevan Thondaman was to be arrested and hence these suspects be remanded till December 13. However the lawyers who appeared for the suspects said this complaint had been made with an ulterior motive and requested that they be released on bail. (Ranjith Rajapakse)

Dont be deceived by political dramas: JVP
	
Referring to joint opposition members joining the government, the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) said today people should not get deceived by the political dramas being enacted today.
JVP Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake said people should learn lessons from what was happening these days because they would bring no benefit to the nation.
Those who crossed over have done so, expecting some benefit. Weerakumara Dissanayake is one of them, and there is also a lady who had joined the government in the morning after voting against the budget the previous night. Isnt this shameless, he asked.
Responding to journalists who asked him whether the JVP had lost its campaign machinery, JVP General Secretary Tilvin Silva said some former JVPers such as NFF leader Wimal Weerawansa had fallen into the dustbin.
Even the Front-line Socialist Party which broke away from the JVP are unable to contest an election, he said.
When asked why party posters cannot be seen today unlike in the past, Mr Silva said the poster campaign had got competitive.
"The poster competition is so volatile that a poster will only remain on a wall for an hour, because a different poster is pasted over it, Mr. Silva said and highlighted the fact that the party had sufficient cadres to handle the campaign. (Yohan Perera)

EC must inquire into John Amaratunga's statement: JO
	
Joint opposition Parliamentarian Janaka Bandara Tennakoon said today the Elections Commissioner (EC) should immediately inquire into the statement made by Minister John Amaratunga.
"He had requested the people to vote at the forthcoming election without any fear because the government and the Police would be on their side and mentioned about the import of coconuts, rice and vegetables from foreign countries. This statement was a threat made against the people," the MP said.
He said these statements were made by politicians to de-stabilise the mindset of the people and referred to the minister's statement stressing the need to import vegetables, as an insult to the Dambulla economic centre saying it was the responsibility of the people to give suitable answers to these politicians at the LG elections.

A purohita who tried to buy freshwater prawns at an unreasonably low price at a well-known prawn market was booed away by the fishermen, they say.
The purohita who was on his way to his home town had his helicopter land on the bund of the prawn breeding lake and made it to the nearby prawn market. On finding that the prawns were being sold for Rs.1,200 a kilo, the purohita had told them that he was prepared to buy the entire haul on sale for Rs.600 a kilo.
Reacting with anger to the purohitas unreasonable bargain, the fishermen had berated him with a liberal use of obscenities.
Finding that the fishermen turning increasingly hostile, the security guards had hastily escorted the purohita back to the helicopter. The fishermen had kept on hooting and hurling abuse at the purohita until the helicopter took off the ground, they say.

Household electric appliances that contain HCFC to be banned
	
Mahaweli Development and Environment Ministry will ban importing of household electric appliances that contain Hydrochloro-flurocarbon (HCFC) effective from January 1st, 2018 as the use of HCFC is extremely harmful to the environment and to the ozone layer, a senior official of the Ministry said yesterday.
The electric equipments thus banned from next year are: Freezer or Refrigerated trucks or Refrigerated containers, Refrigerators, Freezers, Water coolers, Ice machines, Air conditioning and heat pumping units.
Introducing of additional regulations for further strengthening of phasing out of Hydrochloro-flurocarbon (HCFC).
The Ministry of Mahaweli Development and Environment, which is the focal point for Vienna Convention and Montreal Protocol on protection of ozone layer has been entrusted with responsibility in resolving of environment related problems for granting comfortable and healthy environment for the nation. As a party to the Montreal Protocol since 1989, Sri Lanka worked on gradual phase out of ozone depleting substances (ODSs) within the stipulated time frame and has taken initiative in introducing of ozone friendly alternative substances and technologies, Secretary of the Mahaweli Development and Environment, Anura Dissanayaka said.
Some 96 chemicals have been identified as ODSs and out of which import of 56 high aggressive chemicals such as Chloroflurocarbons (CFC), Bromofluoromethane (Halon) Carbontetrachloride (CTC) etc. were banned since 2010. At present, remaining 40 chemicals that are less aggressive on ozone depletion, named Hydrochloroflurofcarbons (HCFC) are being phased out. Several gazette notifications had been published time to time since 1996 for regulating the use of Ozone Depleting Substances, complying with the Montreal Protocol regulations, Mr. Dissanayaka told Daily Mirror.
The relevant gazette notification banning the electric items carrying HCFC chemicals will be issued in the next fortnight, he added.
The last Extraordinary Gazette Notification was issued under the Import and Export (control) Act of 1969 on 01.08.2013 to introduce measures in order to control of HCFC import. Under the new regulations, import quota system was introduced with effect from 01.01.2013, Mr. Dissanayaka pointed out.
With the ongoing phase-out of HCFC programme (Gradual reduction of import of HCFCs), import of HCFC will be cut down by 35% of the quantity imported in 2013. Hence, there will be a shortage of HCFCs in the market for service and maintain of existing equipment, if the import of HCFC based equipment are allowed to continue.
In addition, Sri Lanka has agreed to the resolution adopted at the United Nations Climate Change Conference held in Paris, in December 2015 and subsequently signed in New York on 22nd April 2016 to contribute for the global effort to achieve the long-term goal of keeping the increase in global average temperature to well below 2C above pre-industrial levels. Global Warming Potential of Hydrochloroflurocarbons are greater than carbon dioxide by 1,800 times have direct impact on global warming. Therefore, controlling of ozone depleting substances in order to protect the ozone layer is directly involved to control the global warming, he stressed. (Sandun A Jayasekera)

Jayanthas Pragna Pradeepa celebrates 30 years
	
The elders among us still have nostalgic memories from the past when accomplished politicians ruled the country. This was several decades ago. The sacrifices they made and the dedication with which they serviced made the people happy. It is with a tinge of sadness that they talk about the vacuum created by these politicians who are no more or retired. The politicians who belong to this past era are of such high calibre. Their distancing from the present day politicians is justifiable. However, the present politicians live in a reverie for long years with little or no concern about their duties to the people. These politicians run around seeking support when elections are around the corner. 
Even in present times there are people who command recognition. One such person is the founder of the Pragna Pradeepa Programme Dr. Jayantha de Silva. He has been popular among the people for his dedicated service. He has been distributing large consignments of books and school requisites to the children from low income families and has implemented projects of his own to uplift the poor. This year marks 30 years in De Silvas career as a social worker. 
Withstood criticism 
It is an arduous task to be dedicated in serving the the people. Srimath Anagarika Dharmapala was a classic example of a great man who relinquished all comforts and sacrificed his whole life to serve his fellow men. However, it is sad to know that he has been subjected to criticism and humiliation rather than being praised. Regardless of praise or blame he continued with his services to the nation. He has strongly believed that one mustnt take to social service unless one is prepared to withstand criticism. Ultimately he was so disgusted with the country that he left for India, never to return. Dharmapala was hopeful of being reborn in India after his death. Dharmapalas life story is a clear indication of trials and tribulations facing a man dedicated to service. One can judge in the light of his life story what obstacles would have been experienced by this samaritan Dr. Jayantha de Silva, during his 30 years of serving the public. 
I thought of social service and started my ambitious career as a social worker early in life. I undertook that arduous task even before I took to politics. I followed the path of my parents who were social workers. They often said that the ideal life for a person would be to serve fellow men. Their vehement expectation was that I dedicate my life to serve the nation and my fellow men. Example is better than precept they say. My mother never allowed any visitor to leave at least without having a cup of tea. If it was lunch time he was sure to be hosted to lunch, is how he recalled the days when he was young and came under the care of his parents.
Ananda College gave a new impetus to his ambition and equipped him with the noble concept that of serving the people. Several of the teachers at Ananda College were dedicated social workers who set an example to individuals like Dr. de Silva.

I thought of social service and started my ambitious career as a social worker early in life. I undertook that arduous task even before I took to politics. I followed the path of my parents who were social workers
-Dr.De Silva
The right path
In fact Ananda College had been founded by patriots to kindle the flame of wisdom in children belonging to ordinary families. I as one of them decided to follow in the footsteps of patriots who founded Ananda College. Everyone of these patriots shone as a beacon light to the children and helped to put them on the right path. With this in view I founded the Pragna Pradeepa Programme which today celebrates the 30th anniversary in its long journey, Dr. De Silva said. 
He said that Ananda College was the nursery where he was cast in a mold and turned out as a social worker. There was another indispensable character behind his success. This towering figure in the Pragna Pradeepa Programme is no one else, but its Secretary Deshabandu A Sumith Perera who has been playing an integral role. 
At the beginning the donation of school books was funded by Dr. Jayatha de Silva with his personal wealth. He spent the whole of his salary for this worthy cause. We inaugurated the Pragna Pradeepa Programme with only eight children. We were able to organise a loan scheme for low-income families, depending on self employment. We implemented projects to develop infrastructure facilities in under developed areas. The project to uplift the living standards of carters was just another special project implemented by us, Sumith Perera said. 

They soon realized that the Pragna Pradeepa Programme was for them and they joined hands with us to forge ahead. They offered us strength to make it a massive social service venture which functions as a local NGO.
In reply to a question on the obstacles faced by the Pragna Pradeepa Programme during the 30 years, Sumith said at the outset that the people had a misunderstanding that this programme was just an attempt to gain cheap political mileage. But in the long-run they realized the truth that it was an endeavour to uplift underprivileged people and not one that was politically motivated, Perera said. 
They soon realized that the Pragna Pradeepa Programme was for them and they joined hands with us to forge ahead. They offered us strength to make it a massive social service venture which functions as a local NGO. At present it has a staff comprising 35 people who are rendering a voluntary service, he further added. 
Perera said that a massive donation of schoolbooks along with the holding of a cultural show have been scheduled for December 16 at the Campbell Park in Borella to mark the 30h anniversary of this programme.

Therefore, the Minister should resign from his portfolio taking the responsibility for these killings of elephants reported in the country, except for the natural deaths of elephants. (Chaturanga Pradeep)

There would be a huge outcry in the country if the Sri Lanka Medical Councils (SLMC) altered technical report on minimum standards for medicine, which was submitted by the Health Minister, was passed in Parliament, the Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) warned today.
At a press briefing convened by it, GMOA Assistant Secretary Dr. Naveen de Zoysa accused that the minister had altered the technical report in such a way as to reduce the powers of the SLMC before it was submitted to the Cabinet.
He said it was possible for medical faculty students to restart their struggle if needed and the health minister and University Grant Commission (UGC) Chairman Professor Mohan De Silva should take the blame if this happened.
According to Dr. de Zoysa, the minister had also objected to gazetting the minimum standards of medicine in 2006 and 2010.
He further said the minister has no right to amend the proposals which were agreed to by all the responsible parties. The entire health sector will be disrupted again with this move, he added. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

Nobel Peace Prize winner: The end of mankind is just one impulsive tantrum away
	

Norway, (Daily Mail), 10 December 2017 - The winners of this years Nobel Peace Prize have cautioned that nuclear annihilation is just an impulsive tantrum away.
The winners, the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons (ICAN), made the chilling warning as the United States and North Korea exchange threats over the secretive nations nuclear tests. 
Will it be the end of nuclear weapons, or will it be the end of us said Beatrice Fihn, the head of ICAN, upon receiving the Peace Price on behalf of the anti-nuclear group. 
The only rational course of action is to cease living under the conditions where our mutual destruction is only one impulsive tantrum away, Fihn added. ICAN, a coalition of hundreds of NGOs around the world, has worked for a treaty banning nuclear weapons which was adopted in July by 122 countries. 
Supporters of nuclear weapons argue that they serve as a deterrent for starting a major conflict as it would guarantee mutual destruction for the nations involved.

NEW YORK REUTERS Dec 11-An explosion rocked New Yorks Port Authority, one of the citys busiest commuter hubs in midtown Manhattan, during Monday mornings rush hour, injuring several people.
Police confirmed one person is in custody but were not yet identifying the device used. Local news channel WABC cited police sources as saying a possible pipe bomb detonated in a passageway below ground at Port Authority.
A police officer near the scene said: There was an explosion under Port Authority somewhere in the subway. Thats all weve got for now.
Media reported several people were injured, and WPIX television reported, citing sources, that a man with a possible second device has been detained in the subway tunnel.
New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio and President Donald Trump have been briefed on the incident, according to local media and the White House. There was a stampede up the stairs to get out, said Diego Fernandez, one of the commuters at Port Authority. Everybody was scared and running and shouting.

President's letter to Naseby: PHU says govt. kept it a secret
	
The Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) yesterday said a letter of thank sent by President Maithripala Sirisena to Lord Naseby had been kept concealed by the government due to the pressure of Tamil separatists.
Addressing a news briefing, PHU Leader and MP Udaya Gammanpila said Lord Naseby of the British House of Lords made a statement in UK Parliament in October saying no war crime was committed in Sri Lanka.
The President has sent a letter on behalf of Sri Lanka thanking Lord Naseby. This should be commended but neither Sri Lanka nor the UK knows about this letter, he said.
He said a cover letter issued by the Foreign Affairs Ministry Secretary has been attached with the Presidents letter.
The MP said this cover letter, which was addressed to the Sri Lankan High Commissioner in the UK, says the High Commissioner herself should handover the letter and the contents of the letter should not be shared with either Sri Lankan or British Media.
Why this secrecy If there is any faction which the President should be afraid of when expressing his opinion, it is the Tamil separatists. We have a question whether the President was aware of this secrecy, he said.
However, when contacted, the Foreign Affairs Ministry said there was nothing out of ordinary about sending a letter of this nature along with a letter of the President of Sri Lanka as they come under privileged communication. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Punya Heendeniya and the cinema of femininity
	
He was a rich man now, she hesitantly anddoubtfully uttered in Gamperaliya, thus setting down the confusions and conflicts and shifts of temper that would adorn the first honestly conceived Sinhala film ever made. The man who taught her English in that sequence, conducting lessons under her mothers watchful gaze, aspired to be that rich man, and for the entirety of the film and its sequel, Kaliyugaya, he hoped to win her by gaining the wealth that his education would bring. She on her part gave the impression that she was no more than a submissive receptacle, never capable of any real free will or autonomy, and yet it was because of her submissiveness, her lack of a proper character, that the men and women who figured in her life changed so dramatically. In the very first scene of Gamperaliya Lester James Peries hence said everything that he wanted to say in this respect, and in so doing he went for the perfect couple: the English teacher was Henry Jayasena and the student was Punya Heendeniya.
In the history of the Sinhala cinema women have typically been portrayed as either the objectified fantasies of men they were supposed to be, in which case they were paragons of virtue, or the vamps, the seducers, the rebels they were taught all their lives not to be, in which case they were confused prodigals. Beginning with Rukmani Devi, the female figure almost always embodied goodness, but when she lapsed, when she went wayward, the hero and the star was there to rescue her. The first 20 years of our cinema, right after 1947, saw this kind of woman before the arrival of Malini Fonseka, who in Punchi Baba and Akkara Paha began playing to the fantasies of men by alluring them. The women of our cinema had existed to be rescued and redeemed by their lovers. It was with Malini that we saw a qualitatively different woman.
Between Rukmani and Malini, occupying a twilight world, we see Punya Heendeniya. Punya entered the industry towards the latter part of the 1950s as an idealised woman because Rukmani Devi, who herself was idealised, though as a more tragic figure, was situated in a largely urban and sophisticated setting. Punya figured in quite a different milieu: the rural Sinhala Buddhist bourgeoisie, who gained more prominence after 1956 and the election of Bandaranaike. In the films of L. S. Ramachandran  Deiyange Rate, Kurulubedda, Sikuru Tharuwa  we see the emergence and the empowerment in our cinema of this rural bourgeoisie, along with the myths that they affirmed and in a way symbolised. They all played around with variations of the conventional morality play, pitting good against evil and derived from the female goodness and male heroism which our culture (largely Sinhala and Buddhist) epitomised. Women were never allowed, in the early days, to a watch a Gammaduwa up close, nor were they allowed to don the headgear and go through the Ves Mangalya as they do today. That was at one level misogynistic, and was born in part from a culture of male protectiveness. The myth of female goodness derives for the most from this culture of protectiveness, and in Punya, who was featured in all those three movies, our storytellers found the archetype to square with that cultural sensibility.

The first 20 years of our cinema, right after 1947, saw this kind of woman before the arrival of Malini Fonseka, who in Punchi Baba and Akkara Paha began playing to the fantasies of men by alluring them

The outlook that was articulated and reflected in Deiyange Rate, Kurulubedda, and Sikuru Tharuwa was manifestly informed by the outlook of the Colombo Poets, who, while residing in Colombo, were obsessed with life outside the city. The village, to these poets (who were shaped by the Lake Poets of 19th century England), was the ultimate salvation of their country, their race. As opposed to the Peradeniya poets and novelists, who preferred a Westernised conception of literature, with the individualist, psychological subjectivity of D. H. Lawrence and Virginia Woolf, their counterparts in Colombo inadvertently borrowed from the early English theatre (that influenced the novels of Samuel Richardson) and placed the rural Sinhala Buddhist bourgeoisie and peasantry on the stereotypes of that early morality theatre: the young hero, the ageing villain, the good girl. All three films depicted and placed Punya as that good girl.
In these movies, she consequently privileges tradition over individuality, and gradually becomes bereft of a personality. Ediriweera Sarachchandra in The Sinhalese Novel (which bolstered Martin Wickramasinghes reputation) contended that the only characteristic of Nanda, from Gamperaliya, was her lack of any vivid character. She only existed to listen to her elders, to willingly reject any outside intrusions and step in line with the accepted authority. Gamperaliya was a more realistic, and thus a more multifarious, depiction of that obedient woman; Kurulubedda, which got praised so lavishly by Sinhalese critics (particularly those like Jayawilal Wilegoda) that it was erroneously considered the first real Sinhala film (instead of Rekava), wasnt multifarious this way. The women in it existed in a dichotomised world, between good and evil, submission and rebellion: in short, the past and the future.
It was a Colombo poet who scripted these films, incidentally: P. K. D. Seneviratne, acknowledged by Lester James Peries as probably the only man at the time who wrote original movie scripts. He attributed to Punyas characters an emotional resonance and spirit of resilience which could easily be squared with the triumph of moral goodness within her. Punya was a beauty, but never overly and superficially adorned: she was more a simple village damsel than the cosmetic nightingale that Rukmani Devi had been, and continued to be. She gave the impression of being fragile, of being open to abuse and exploitation, but because of her moral standing perhaps, she warded off every and any obstacle that beset her (particularly in Sikuru Tharuwa, where she wards off the advances of the lascivious vel vidane, played by D. R. Nanayakkara).
Her career was never as prolific and versatile as that of her contemporaries, but Id like to think this was more a strength than a weakness on her part. In an industry where men were said to make the moves  long before Nadeeka Gunasekara, Swarna Mallawarachchi, and Anoja Weerasinghe came forward and, in the films they were in, repudiated the patriarchy inherent in their field  being a prolific actress could have diluted her image of the perennially optimistic and tradition bound woman. We needed her at this juncture (the 1960s) because, while her characters seem rather overly optimistic and hopeful today, they help explain, and also reflect, the subtle ways in which culture and cinema cross each others paths even in a society where the movies are still derided as a Western import (like ours).
Ramachandrans Deiyange Rate, an adaptation of the W. A. Silva novel, was a watershed in this respect.

Punya was a beauty, but never overly and superficially adorned: she was more a simple village damsel than the cosmetic nightingale that Rukmani Devi had been, and continued to be. She gave the impression of being fragile, of being open to abuse and exploitation
Peries did away with the need to bifurcate our women  between goodhearted lovers on the one hand and unredeemable vamps on the other  with Gamperaliya. I wrote before that in Lester we come across our first film-maker who raised flak and earned praise from every quarter in our critical fraternity. That was because he was uncompromising in his attempts to peel away the false and the tawdry, the remnants of the past, which the Sinhala cinema thrived on. If Gamperaliya seems too slow paced today (especially to those who have short attention spans) its because no one can match his meticulous attention to visual detail. To a considerable extent this was true of his depiction of the two main women in the story: the Kaisaruvatte sisters, Nanda and Anula. In Punya he had found the perfect embodiment of rural innocence, but he never forced her to become one-dimensional the way she had been earlier. What this compelled, subsequently, was an amalgamation of sensibilities between the realist in Lester and the romantic in Seneviratne. The two would amalgamate in Ran Salu.
Kurulubedda was celebrated as the first real Sinhala film, erroneously, even though it was inspired by the visual loveliness of Rekava. Ran Salu, which is set against the urban bourgeoisie, in Colombo 7, was in that sense inspired by the milieu that was depicted in Delovak Athara, with roughly the same cast (Irangani Serasinghe, J. B. L. Gunasekara, Tony Ranasinghe). Laleen Jayamanne in her book Toward Cinema and its Double implies that in Ran Salu we see the authorial intervention of Peiris in the storys transformation of the innocent village girl to an innocent Colombo 7 girl. But that wasnt really Peries, because as he himself said frequently, he had no actual control over the plot: it was Seneviratne himself who had wanted to turn Punya into an urbanised version of the village damsel she had played before. Lesters film is an inversion of the modernist paradigm of getting the city to assimilate the village; Punyas character, Sujatha, well to do and complacent, sees the futility of such a thing and tries to achieve the opposite. Again, we see here that thin line between submission and rebellion, in turn reflected by the line between the past and the future. The past is idealised, poetically and in almost unrealistic ways, while the future is demonised (the antagonist, Cyril, who is engaged to Sujatha, dreams of such a future in England: he tells her father that he is disgusted by betel-chewing villagers). Unlike Seneviratnes previous forays, here goodness and badness are not concentrated in the village, but are instead split between the rural and the urban: the former epitomised by Dayananda Gunadawardena as Senaka, the latter by Tony Ranasinghe as Cyril. Her implied engagement to the former at the end, which subverts our expectations of her taking to the life of a nun, repudiates any image we would have entertained of her giving up her upbringing for the religious. Punya, going by that, remained moored to the secular world, as a harbinger of moral goodness: a secular life of explicit devotion.

After her departure to Africa and later to England, with her husband, she returned to the cinema to play a different woman: the Nanda of Kaliyugaya
After her departure to Africa and later to England, with her husband, she returned to the cinema to play a different woman: the Nanda of Kaliyugaya. We see a shattering of the idealisms of her youth here; all thats left is a shell-shocked, sterile, empty life. But one role was never enough, which is why, even today, as I look through all her performances, she remains the finest tribute to rural femininity we could have had. The cinema of rural femininity, in Sri Lanka that is, consequently belongs to her.

Railway strike enters 6th day
	
The Railway Trade Union Alliance (RTUA) said today it would continue with the work stoppage now on its sixth day despite President Maithripala Sirisena requesting all strikers to report for work
Earlier the President requested the strikers to report for duty considering the difficulties faced by the people and the students sitting the GCE O/L examination.
RTUA co-convener Lal Ariyaratne told Daily Mirror if the President or the Prime Minister intervenes in resolving railway strike, the union would consider operating trains at least for the sake of students sitting the GCE O/L examination.
He said none of the higher officials had intervened in resolving this matter and were determined to continue the work stoppage. Mr. Ariyaratne said the unions have been called for discussions today at Sethsiripaya in Battaramulla.
"We have been compelled to continue with the work stoppage because instead of resolving this matter the President had declared the railway services as essential service.
Meanwhile, the Civil Aviation and Transport Ministry said steps were being taken to operate at least 40 trains to enable students sitting the O/L examination and other train travellers.
Railways General Manager Mahanama Abeywickrama said seven trade unions which had joined the railway strike had reported for duty. (Chaturanga Pradeep and Darshana Sanjeewa)

Virat Kohlis wedding will be an intimate family affair
	

New Delhi, (Hindustan Times), Dec 9 2017 - Amid all the speculation about actor Anushka Sharma and cricketer Virat Kohlis upcoming wedding in Milan, Italy, the buzz is that the destination wedding will actually be a rather small affair.
It has already been reported that only family members of the couple, with some really close friends of Virat like his childhood coach, Rajkumar Sharma, will be part of the function.
However, according to a report in Times Now, there is a celebrity guest list, although a very slim one. Among Anushkas friends from the industry, only her first co-star Shah Rukh Khan, her PK co-star Aamir Khan, YRFs Aditya Chopra and director of Anushkas first film Maneesh Sharma have been invited. 
From Virats end, only his biggest pals  Sachin Tendulkar, Yuvraj Singh and coach Rajkumar Sharma  have been included. Not many people have been invited, as it is a really small function.

## Title: Will OMP ensure justice

Will OMP ensure justice  
	

comes to a close families of the disappeared still linger in hope that their loved ones would return. Some have been missing for decades and yet their loved ones express hope of their return. In the Budget 2018 speech Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera said that the Office of Missing Persons(OMP) will commence operations from 2018. However the debates on the Enforced Disappearance Bill have been postponed twice. Against this backdrop civil societies have shown concern over the delay in passing the Enforced Disappearances bill and setting up of the OMP. 

Disappointing responses 
The UN rapporteur on Transitional Justice Pablo de Greiff, who visited the country recently, said that there were victims in every community who have rights to truth, justice, reparations and guarantees of non-recurrence. Amnesty International (AI) has estimated that since the 1980s there have been at least 60,000 and as many as 100,000 cases of enforced disappearances in Sri Lanka. The victims include Sinhalese young men suspected of having connections with the JVP in 1989 and 1990 and Tamils suspected of links with the LTTE during the war. The victims also include human rights defenders, aid workers, journalists and critics of the Government. 
Attorney-at-Law and senior researcher at the Centre for Policy Alternatives (CPA), Bhavani Fonseka, said that though successive Governments have identified enforced disappearances as a problem, the responses from the Governments, including the current regime, have been disappointing. The Government committed to an office of missing persons and to criminalize enforced disappearances. As for the OMP, despite the commitment to establish it in 2015, to date it has not still been operationalized. Minister Samaraweera said during his budget speech that it will be operationalized in January, 2018. CPA is extremely concerned about these delays, she said. Meanwhile the Constitutional Council has reportedly selected seven members to the OMP and the names have been submitted to the President for approval. 
Sri Lanka is a signatory to the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance since December 10, 2015.This was also committed in 2015. The Government ratified the convention in 2016 and made a draft enabling legislation with the Government in attempts made to have a debate on it. But the debates were postponed, said Fonseka. 
National Peace Council Executive Director Dr. Jehan Perera <U+200E> admitted that though the Government was proceeding slowly it was on the correct path. I am confident the enforced disappearances bill will eventually receive approval. This will possibly be after the Local Government Elections because the Government doesnt wish to give any opportunity to the opposition to use these new initiatives for political propaganda, said Perera. 
The Opposition claims that these efforts are aimed at targeting the military, the war heroes, and the security forces. It is meant to ensure that our security forces operate within the law, and dont violate peoples human rights, he explained. 
Asked if the disappearances that took place during the JVP insurrection were included in these new initiatives he said that there was no time bar on the OMP. 

HRC downgraded 
Many families with victims of enforced disappearances have made complaints at the Human Rights Commission(HRC). On inquiry a Commissioner of the Human Rights commission, Ambika Satkunanathan said that the failure to take action regarding complaints of enforced disappearances is one reason the HRC was downgraded from A to B status in 2007 by the International Coordinating Committee on National Human Rights Institutions. 

Commissions appointed 
A number of Presidential commissions appointed have issued substantive reports which include the names of alleged perpetrators whom the Commissions have recommended action be taken against. However, these recommendations werent implemented and in some instances the reports of the Commissions werent released, she said.
Fonseka expressed similar sentiments that though successive Governments have appointed commissions there hasnt been action taken afterwards. Weve seen the all island commission on enforced disappearances headed by Manouri Muttetuwagama in the 90s. Then we had the Udalagama Commission, the LLRC Commission and several others. One of the recommendations of the LLRC which was made public in 2011 was that this issue of enforced disappearances is so significant, that it needs special attention and as a result the previous Government established the Paranagama Commission. So successive Governments have come up with very specific measures, mostly commissions of inquiries. But it has stopped there,she added. 
The President has met with families of the disappeared and promised that the Government would probe the issue of enforced disappearances. But again it seems to be more the rhetoric, than real action, noted Fonseka. 
She stressed that as the Government of Sri Lanka has committed locally and internationally to take specific steps to address the issue, it could not be said that it was an international conspiracy or some form of an international agenda. 

Make such acts a crime 




Dr. Perera further said that the existing law can be used to investigate into cases of enforced disappearances. At the moment there is no will because of opposition, misunderstanding, false propaganda about what all these means, he stressed. In a Supreme Court FR case on enforced disappearances, decided this year, the Supreme Court found the State to be responsible for the disappearance of two individuals and ordered the State to pay Rs 1 million each to their parents as compensation.

The case was about the enforced disappearance of Selvarajah Gunaseelan and K Kugadas in Batticaloa in 2008. The OIC of the police station was ordered to pay Rs 50,000 each to the parents of the disappeared persons.The duo disappeared when they were at the police station. 
Meanwhile Fonseka pointed out that no one can be prosecuted for the crime of enforced disappearance as an enforced disappearance wasnt a crime within the Sri Lankan legal jurisdiction. 
Offenses such as kidnappings and abductions- found in the penal code- dontencompass the crime of enforced disappearances. The operationalizing of the OMP and criminalizing enforced disappearances are attempts to prevent this from happening, she said. 

Parents deaths were accelerated by their grief,
-Dandeniya

In 1989 a factory worker in the free trade zone, Ranjith Herath was summoned for a labour inquiry. He was accompanied by M.Lionel. However they never returned home. The following day their bodies were found burning at the Raddoluwa junction in Seeduwa where now a monument has been built to commemorate the disappeared. Heraths fiance at the time Jayanthi Dandeniya, now a political activist, spoke to the Daily Mirror about how the damage inflicted by the JVP insurrection and the extra-judicial killings have now become merely a thing of the past which is considered as a fascinating story. 
The parents of the children who disappeared during the 1988/89 period are very old now. Some have died. The truth is that the death of these parents was accelerated by their grief, she said. 

He son would have been murdered, but the body would have not been handed over to the mother. Instead the perpetrators would take it with them
She further said that some parents had suffered from mental illnesses as a result of the grief. Dandeniya said that some of the young wives remarried, but most of them didnt. Nevertheless they have endured difficulties and educated their children well. The mothers tried to hide from their children the fact that their fathers had been killed when they were small. Some children were lied to that their fathers were abroad, she said.
Referring to events at that time, Dandeniya said that people would be killed and there would be a piece of paper lying close to the dead bodies stating that the bodies shouldnt be removed. Peoples ears were cut. NICs were collected. People were asked to switch off lights,she reminisced. 
There is no punishment for the perpetrators. No one investigates. There are no court cases, she claimed. The son would have been murdered, but the body would have not been handed over to the mother. Instead the perpetrators would take it with them. How can this be a disappearance The mother saw the child being killed, said Dandeniya who hails from Beliaththa where the JVP was very powerful. Two of her brothers were also victims to these killings. 

The parents of the children who disappeared during the 1988/89 period are very old now. Some have died. The truth is that the death of these parents was accelerated by their grief




An MOU with the OMP 
As the Office of Missing Persons will be a specialized body dedicated to investigate enforced disappearances the HRC hopes to enter into a memorandum of understanding(MOU) with the OMP instead of replicating the work of the OMP.  We are pleased that the recent budget has allocated a substantial sum to begin its operations, said Satkunanathan. 

Recommendations 
The HRC has written to President Maithripala Sirisena urging him to ensure the Bill on the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearances is enacted and has recommended changes to the current Bill to strengthen it and bring it in line with the International Convention on the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance. Apart from the Bill being passed and the OMP being set up Dr.Perera recommended that there should be a campaign to spread awareness to inform people about the purpose of these

initiatives and that they are not about threatening national security. This is about protecting human security and human security is what national security is all about. We have security forces because we want to protect the people of this country.
These laws are meant to protect the people of the country. That message has to be taken to the people at large, so that they arent deceived by false propaganda,said Dr. Perera. 

Enforced Disappearances defined 



Missing persons could also include persons who have gone missing due to reasons not involving the State as well

According to Article 2 of the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance an enforced disappearance is the arrest, detention, abduction or any other form of deprivation of liberty by agents of the State or by persons or groups of persons acting with the authorization, support or acquiescence of the State, followed by a refusal to acknowledge the deprivation of liberty or by concealment of the fate or whereabouts of the disappeared person, which place such a person outside the protection of the law. 
As Dr.Jehan Perera pointed out missing persons could also include persons who have gone missing due to reasons not involving the State as well. 

Very progressive move, says Mano Ganesan
Speaking to the Daily Mirror Minister of national Co-Existence Dialogue and Official Languages Mano Ganesan said that the OMP will be operationalized in the weeks to come. The effort to operationalize the OMP is a very progressive move. Due to the efforts of people like us within the Government, the civil society and the international community, the OMP is slowly, but steadily taking shaped, he said. 
The President has to formally approve the names of the OMP commissioners decided on by the Constitutional Council, he added. 
Asked whether the enforced disappearance bill will be taken up for debate soon, he said that that the focus now was on the OMP. The Bill which was to be submitted to the Parliament was postponed. Since the OMP Act has already been passed, we thought that we would start with the OMP, and proceed with the Bill afterwards, he said. 
Once the OMP is established people not only from the North and East, but also the South can make complaints, he said throwing light on the positives of the OMP. This will not be a static office. There will be regional offices, mobile offices which can go to villages and approach the people, he added.

Young researchers find new reptile
	
When fauna and flora are in abundance they display the richness of a countrys bio-diversity. Young researchers and scientists have discovered and introduced a new species. Such tasks can be termed as a national responsibility. This is the story of a discovery and introduction of a new serpent (reptile) by a Sri Lankan research team. 
The young researchers have been able to locate the new species in the slopes of Sripada (Adams Peak) forest reserve in the central hills. This new species has been named Aspidura Ravanai. It has been zoologically introduced to the world of science by the group of researchers comprising Mendis Wickremesinghe, Dulan Ranga Widanapathirana , H.K. Dushantha Kandambi, R. Alexander and Nethu Wickremesinghe. 

The young researchers have been able to locate the new species in the slopes of Sripada (Adams Peak) forest reserve in the central hills. This new species has been named Aspidura Ravanai
Clear difference
According to them, this species has a clear difference from Aspidura due to distinct features such as unique colour pattern, scale system and molecular inheritance. They have stated about this in the research paper named ZOOTAXA published in the international Science magazine on November 13. The number of reptile species reported in Sri Lanka is about eight with this new discovery, according to these researches. 
Dushantha Kandambi, a member of this research team, has pointed out that this Aspidura species is a kind of a serpent endemic to this country alone. He adds that the number of serpents reported in Sri Lanka is about 51. Accordingly, the entire number of serpents has increased up to 104. 
They say that they were able to identify this serpent species when they were engaged in the documentation of the reptiles and the diversity of amphibians living in natural forest reserve of the Samanala Kanda, which belongs to Knuckles World heritage Zone in the central hills of Sri Lanka. 
According to them, this new serpent species that has been named as Ravanas Medilla can mostly be found in the hilly forests located at the altitude of 1650  2000 ft. from the sea level. Their habitats can be seen in the layers, with the depth ranging from 30 cm, among the decayed leaves and parts of trees and loose soil. 
Kandambi further pointed out that this serpent species has been named as Ravanai, or Ravanas Medilla alias Aspidura Ravanai in order to remember the name of a  Bherunda emperor by the name of king Ravana who is said to have possessed an incomparable intelligence and power and believed to have lived in this country about 5000 years ago. Accordingly, this serpent species has been introduced by the English name: Ravanas rough-side Snake.
