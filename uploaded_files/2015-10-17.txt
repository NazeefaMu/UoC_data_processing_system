SL not to approach EU against Indian fishermen
	
		 		 
		 
			
The government will not make any complaint to the European Union (EU) about alleged poaching by Indian fishermen in Sri Lankan waters, even as it has decided to increase the amount of penalty for violation of fisheries laws in international waters, Cabinet Spokesman Rajitha Senaratne said.
The Hindu Newspaper quoting the Minister said that the decision of the government has been made as India is a ?friendly neighbor?.
The EU comes into the picture as it imposed, in January this year, a ban on export of fish and fishery products from Sri Lanka as the country?s fishermen were violating the international laws.?
According to an official document, 36 activities were fulfilled by July end and the EU, at a meeting in Brussels to review the progress, had expressed satisfaction but pointed out that the amount of penalties had not been hiked. In September, it also reminded the Ministry for not having raised the amount.
The issue came up before the Cabinet of the Sri Lankan government on Wednesday and it was decided to make the penalty five times the value of fish catch. The penalty would be determined, taking into account the size of vessel too. This would also cover import and export of fish.?
On the implication of the decision for alleged poaching by Indian fishermen invariably along the coast of the Northern Province, Dr. Senaratne told The Hindu that this would not be applicable as the fishermen were doing fishing in the ?Sri Lankan waters? and the move pertained to the international waters.

Sri Lankan man missing in Australia
	
Search operation for missing Sri Lankan man Rajah Thangarajah of Eastlakes has been launched after the father-of-two mysteriously vanished in Australia over a week ago.
The 62-year-old was last seen at his home at about 9.30pm on Thursday, by his daughter Kayathri Thangarajah.
?We?ve looked everywhere we could think of,? she told the Southern Courier.
?He doesn?t have his credit card, he didn?t take any money or his phone, and it?s hard to think where he has been for a week without any of it.?
When Ms Thangarajah left for work on Friday his car was gone.
She assumed he had gone for a morning swim or walk at Coogee, which was his regular activity in recent weeks.
?Police have done sea searches, helicopter searches and bushland searches.
?We?ve done the whole Coogee to Bondi walk and gone all of the way to Maroubra and La Perouse as well and we haven?t found anything or any trace of him.?
Mr Thangarajah?s wife was in Sri Lanka for a family visit, and his son was in Chicago ? both of them arrived back to join the search on Sunday.
?We would have expected something to turn up by now. We have had no contact with him and no one has seen him,? Ms Thangarajah said.
Mr Thangarajah has been married for 32 years, and is semi-retired. Ms Thangarajah said he ?lived for his family and friends? and his disappearance was ?totally out of character?.
?We grew up in Coogee, so he knows the area. He is a strong enough swimmer to be in the water and Coogee was not very choppy at all at that time.?
He is described as being of Indian appearance, 170cm tall and with a medium build. He is balding with greying hair and walks with a hunched gait.
