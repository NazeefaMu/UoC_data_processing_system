Numbers that shape your destiny from 31 to 40
	
We are now discussing the significance of numbers based on the numerical and vibrational value of the name of an individual.
In a previous article we pointed out that a name could be modified to produce a numerical value corresponding to a favourable number if the present name does not relate to a favourable number due to its unfavorable numerical value.
In the previous articles, we have discussed the significance of numbers from 10 to 30, based on the numerical and vibrational or resonance value.
In this article we propose to discuss the significance of Numbers from 31 to 40.
Number 31: This number signifies isolation and self-confinement. Being more introvert than extrovert, the subject would take an apathetic attitude towards worldly affairs. Therefore, he would suffer from want and his life would be a failure.
Number 32: This number indicates expansion, advancement and progress. Success comes from organizations, companies and cartels. It is more beneficial for the subject to act on his own initiative than to depend on others judgment.
Number 33: Success due to help from those holding high office and through the love of the members of the opposite sex.
Number 34: This number predicts strength and benefits from experience and trial and error. Difficulties may prove to be stepping stones to success.
Number 35: This number portends dangers and calamities. The subject may suffer financial losses from games of chance like gambling. Problems in married life are also in the offing.
Number 36: This number confers drive, energy, command and authority. Native possesses initiative and executive skills. Action on his own initiative would bring him success.
Number 37: This number holds much potential for the good. It indicates good fortune and good luck from friends and loved ones. Success in marriage and partnerships is strongly indicated.
Number 38: The number predicts losses to employees, friends and business associates. The subject would face obstacles in his career, and also unexpected setbacks, grief and deception. He would fall victim to the wiles of the opposite sex.
Number 39: The subject possesses a discerning mind and a sharp intellect. He seldom gains material success as he fails to apply his keen faculties for practical purposes.
Number 40: Native possesses a sharp intellect and perception. But worldly success like fame and wealtheludes him.

pain communicates
	
Intriguing ways in which
Have you heard of the modern saying Malithta gahaddi Chanchala adanawa (Chanchala crying when Malith is being punished) There is a similar occurrence that we can relate to when talking about physical pain, from a medical perspective. 
Have you felt warning signals such as pain in the left arm or jaw This may be a sign of a heart attack! Similarly, a disorder in the gallbladder can surface first in the form of pain in the right shoulder tip. Similarly a problem related to the pancreas can begin with back pain. This phenomenon is called referred pain in medicine. Why does a seemingly unrelated site respond to a problem present in another side of the body This is just another example of Mother Natures sense of humor. Well explore more about the topic in this weeks segment titled Interesting Medicine. 
In order to understand this, youll have to have a very basic understanding about the transmission of pain in the body. The nerves carrying the sensation of pain go towards the spinal cord. It is there that the signal is given to one of the intermediate transmission centres. They carry the signal upwards to the respective area of the brain. This is the process that makes us aware of pain. These transmission centers are situated in the spinal cord, surrounded by the vertebrae. The meeting place in these transmission centres for nerves from various parts of the body is different. In the spinal cord, these meeting places are named according to the level of respective vertebrae covering them. 

Never take lightly a sudden onset persistent pain in the jaw, upper left or even right arms because these might be the first warning signs of a heart attack
The skin and the internal organs of the body are innervated by different nerves in the body. But sometimes, both these nerves end up in the same transmission center of the spinal cord. 
Now comes the interesting part. Think of two siblings, one very subdued and the other always getting into trouble. Say the subdued, calm one broke a vase when nobody was looking. The parents are going to jump to the conclusion that it was the mischievous one who did it, since he is usually the culprit, right Scientists are theorizing that its what causes the pain in your arm and jaw, when actually the problem lies in your heart. When the heart, which doesnt usually give out pain signals, sends a signal, the spinal cord, which is used to receiving all sorts of pain signals from mosquito bites to abrasions from the skin, assumes that the skin nerves are the culprit. It then sends the message to the brain. So your brain, in turn gives you wrong information saying that hey, your jaw is paining. 
While being entertained by the interesting way that the brain itself can be made a fool of, never take lightly a sudden onset persistent pain in the jaw, upper left or even right arms because these might be the first warning signs of a heart attack. You could save a life by being alert and by directing a person to seek early treatment.

Pakistan ejects MSF from militancy-hit tribal district
	

PESHAWAR AFP Sept14, 2017 
Pakistani authorities have asked the Doctors Without Borders (MSF) aid group to close its medical facilities in a militancy-wracked tribal district, the organisation said, as officials tighten controls on foreign NGOs working in the country. 
MSF said the government has refused to renew the permit required to continue its healthcare projects in Kurram district in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) located in the restive northwest along the Afghan border. 
The tribal districts are among the poorest areas in Pakistan, and are governed under a draconian legal system introduced by British colonial rulers more than a century ago. 
A senior government official in Kurram confirmed that MSF has been asked to stop working in the district after its permit expired. 
MSF has been working in Kurram since 2004 where it was responsible for an outpatient department for children under five years and an inpatient department for severely ill children up to 12 years of age.

Palisena questioned about Aloysius Friends in Powerful Places
	
During the cross-examination, PTL CEO Kasun Palisena yesterday accepted that he placed bids and took other appropriate steps at the March 29, 2016 auction following instructions received from Arjun Aloysius, who was in possession of inside information according to the phone recording played before the Commission.
Continuing the Cross-examination of PTL CEO Kasun Palisena, Deputy Solicitor General Milinda Gunatilleke questioned the witness on the auctions that had taken place in October, 2015 and March, 2016.
DSG Gunatilleke explained during the proceedings there were two secrets as to how PTL gained phenomenal profits in November 2015. He said PTL knew precisely how to bid at the October auction knowing the cut off point and later sold those bonds accepted in the auction to EPF through an intermediary (PABC) within a very short period of time (in November 2015).
This cutoff point is what CBSL decided on the bids received at a Treasury bond auction. It is simply a decision on the rate until which point the CBSL would accept bids (borrowings) from Primary Dealers at the auction.
The DSG also revealed that EPF had not even placed a bid at the October auction but had bought bonds at a higher price from PTL after a few days in November, resulting in PTL to gaining a considerably higher profit.
But witness Kasun Palisena rejected this view of the DSG.
DSG Gunatilleke: So, PTL precisely placed a higher volume of bids at the cutoff mark of the auction, which was finally accepted right
Witness Palisena: Yes
DSG: And this has been happening previously as well in auctions
W: Not always
DSG: But often enough
W: There are instances
DSG: These are gifts received by PTL and a life time opportunity to make profits, right
W: Cant comment on that  but yes it may be true
DSG Gunatilleke was of the view that having known until which yield rate the CBSL would accept bids, PTL had placed a higher chunk of bids at that cutoff rate.
Referring to the bid sheets of the auctions, the DSG showed that PTLs bid was the last accepted bid at that auction by the CBSL.
DSG Gunatilleke said that PTL later sold those bonds obtained from the auction to EPF through PABC in the secondary market in the backdrop where the EPF had not even bid at that October auction.
Justice Prasanna Jayawardena at this point specifically asked the DSG about the time gap between the October auction and PTLs sale of those bonds to the EPF. DSG Gunatilleke said it was about four days after the auction that EPF had bought these bonds at a price higher than what had been offered in the auction.
Reminding the two occasions where PTL was in requirement of contingency funds, DSG Gunatilleke sarcastically commented that PTLs banker during a financial crisis was the EPF, because there were a large number of instances where PTL had engaged in REPO transactions (instrument of borrowing) with the EPF when they were in need of contingency funds in treasury bond trading.
These two occasions were, immediately after the February 27, 2015 auction when PTL was required to settled the amount accepted in the auction, and on April 4, 2016 when PTL was in ILF (intra day lending facility) default.
It was also revealed that after February 27, 2015 auction PTL had not received lending facilities from other commercial banks and institutions due to the negative publicity it had received.
Justice Jayawardena: So, you usually go to the EPF when emergency money is needed, right
Witness: Yes, if they have.
J: Have the EPF been ever running out of money
W: No
DSG Gunatilleke: If the EPF had bid in those auctions they wouldnt have had the opportunity to fund you at these particular times, right
W: That I wouldnt know.
At this point DSG Gunatilleke played the Singapore phone call, in which Aloysius instructs Palisena.
In this conversation, Mr. Aloysius was instructing Palisena on how to bid at the March 29, 2016 auction, its importance referring to the information he received from sources, the rates at which he should bid at the auction, the biding rates of the EPF and the cut off rate until which CBSL would accept the bids.
In this conversation, Aloysius referred his sources that he received information as Our friend in the department, our friends in powerful places. Also Aloysius always says that He said during this conversation.
Aloysius passes information to Palisena in the conversation regarding a state bankers meeting which was immediately finished at that time.
However, on an earlier occasion, cross-examining the chief dealer of PTL Nuwan Salgado, Counsel Chanaka de Silva, who was appearing on behalf of Arjuna Mahendran moved that this information given by Aloysius were ultimately wrong.
DSG Gunatilleke yesterday showed the accuracy of the information passed by Aloysius to his CEO Kasun Palisena in this conversation which happened around 9.18 a.m. and 9.34 a.m. on March 29, 2016 (at the time when the auctions floor had been opened to bids)
Firstly, Aloysius instructs Palisena that the CBSL would accept any bid up to a rate between 14.80% to14.90%.
Secondly, he predicts there wont be a rate cut by the CBSL as the market expected in the coming months.
Then he instructs Palisena to bid several small volumes of bids at a rate of 13.50% at the auction.
Aloysius then instructs Palisena to place a large chunk of bids at 14.80% rate.
Establishing that all the aforesaid instructions were reliably followed by Palisena, DSG Gunatilleke confirmed that PTL had bid exactly on the instructions of Aloysius which was based on some information received from sources.
The DSG showing bid sheets of PTL confirmed that the 14.80% was the cut off rate until which CBSL had accepted bids in the March 29, 2016 auction.
Showing a press release of CBSL, DSG Gunatilleke said that on March 29, 2016, evening CBSL announced that there wont be a rate cut as the market expected. The DSG observed that the Monetary Board meeting which took the decision on this rate cut had taken place in the Morning on March 29, 2016. (The morning in which Palisena received Aloysius call)
DSG Gunatilleke also proved submitting bidding sheets, that PTL had bid in small chunks of bids at a rate of 13.50% and later had bid a large amount of bids as one chunk at a rate of 14.80%, which ultimately resulted as the last bid that had been accepted by the CBSL in that auction. The DSG said that Aloysius was pinpoint accurate on the cut off rate in that conversation.
A sample of how PTL had bid at the March 27, 2016 auction
1 billion bid at a 13.65%
1 billion bid at a 13.66%
1 billion bid at a 13.67%
1 billion bid at a13.68%
1 billion bid at a 13.68%
5 billion bid through (PABC) at a 14.68% which was the last bid accepted by the CBSL as cutoff rate at the auction.
DSG Gunatilleke: You had received pinpoint accurate directions as how to bid from Aloysius, right
Witness Palisena: Yes
DSG: Aloysius gave you instructions on yield rates and bidding amounts, right
W: Yes
DSG: And thereafter you bid accordingly, right
Palisena: Yes (after some hesitation)
DSG Gunatilleke and Justice Prasanna Jayawardena repeatedly questioned the witness thereafter on the same lines.
Afterwards Chairman of the Commission Justice K.T. Chitrasiri questioning the witness asked whether he accept that Aloysius had given him certain instructions and thereafter he continued the trade according to those instructions at the March 29, 2016 auction. Witness Palisena accepted that he acted according to the instructions received by him from Aloysius.
Justice Prasanna Jayawardena and DSG Gunatilleke thereafter questioned the witness on the words referred in the conversation by Aloysius as our friend in the department, our friends in powerful places, he said and once in a life time opportunity.
DSG Gunatilleke: Did it ever occur to you as to how Arjun Aloysius gives instructions like this information you received
Witness: No, he was always instructing me in that manner.
DSG: Aloysius mentions our friend in the department, our friends in powerful places and he said in his conversation to you, right
W: Yes
DSG: Do you know about them as Aloysius referred to them when giving the information
W: No
At this point Justice Chitrasiri also questioned the witness as to why he never asked Aloysius from where he got this inside information. Witness Palisena said: It was how Aloysius normally talks using such words.
DSG: In your view, what could be those references
W: That I dont know
Adding amusement to the query DSG Gunatilleke asked the witness Could it be somebody from Ceylon Transport Board Everyone laughed while the witness was silent.
DSG: Could it be coming from the Public Debt Department of CBSL
W: I dont know about it
DSG: You are saying that you dont know who the people Aloysius was referring to are, isnt it
W: Yes. That is the general way how Aloysius speaks to me.
DSG: I am telling that you are lying to this Commission.
W: I disagree, why would I do so.
DSG: Exactly. Then tell the truth. Who were the people Aloysius was referring Dont carry the can (taking responsibility for a mistake done by someone else)
W: I dont know about it. Aloysius would know it.
DSG: So, you are saying all those things are known to Aloysius only, right
The witness answer was affirmative in an unconvincing manner.
At this point DSG Gunatilleke remarked the importance of Arjun Aloysius evidence before the Commission as there were facts that remain only within the knowledge of Aloysius.
The DSG and Justice Jayawardena repeatedly questioned the witness on Aloysius instructions in that conversation which was based on some inside information received by him. The witness however, was of the view that it was Aloysius way of talking.
DSG: Was Aloysius privy to certain information from the EPF and other government institutions And were you not surprised when Aloysius told you that he got information about EPFs bidding rates Why was that
Witness: That I dont know. But that is how he speaks generally.
Then the DSG played a section of the recording which shows Aloysiu saying that he received EPFs bidding rates.
DSG: So, this must be a common occurrence then, right
Witness answer was unconvinced again and therefore Justice Jayawardena and DSG Gunatilleke continuously questioned the witness about it.
During that questioning it suddenly popped out from Kasun Palisenas mouth: This is just before an auction, and this is how Aloysius instructs me usually just before an auction.
Very good, that is what exactly we wanted to know, DSG Gunatilleka said in a pleased manner.
Finally concluding the long run of questioning, Justice Jayawardena asked Palisena briskly.
Justice Jayawardena: Now tell me, Aloysius is not a liar or a fool right
Witness: Yes
J: So whatever he passed to you as information should therefore be accurate, right
W: Yes,
J: Did Aloysius normally get involved in this sort of big investment processes
W: Yes
J: Was he in a habit of instructing you as he did in that phone conversation on March 29, 2016
W: Yes
J: Now it is clear that these types of transactions had happened earlier as well and that is not an unusual occurrence, right
W: Yes
J: When Aloysius was instructing, you, were you writing it down, right
W: Yes
J: And according to that phone conversation, Aloysius was also referring to some paper on which he had written down notes, isnt that so
W: Yes
J: So, wasnt that clear that he had also received information from somewhere else
W: Most probably yes.
J: He says friends in powerful places in the conversation. What are these powerful places
W: That I dont know
When Justice Jayawardena questioned whether these places could be the Public Debt Department (PDD) and the Tender Board (TB), the witness answer was negative and said he would not know about it.
It was explained from the questioning of Justice Jayawardena that the PDD of CBSL recommends the cutoff rate of an auction to the Tender Board and after the approval of the TB it goes for the approval of the Governor.
Justice Jayawardena also questioned the witness about the nature of the relationships between Aloysius and the EPF dealer and the NSB dealer.
Justice Jaywardena: According to previous evidence, it was revealed that Aloysius and EPFs dealer, Saman Kumara were good friends. Was it correct
W: Yes. They should be friends.
J: Then what about NSB dealer Naveen Anuradha Was he a friend of Aloysius too
W: Yes they must be knowing each other
When Justice Jayawardane questioned the witness about whom in the PDD that PTL had dealt in their daily trading, the witness disclosed several lower ranking names in the PDD.
The Justice repeatedly questioned him whether there were high ranking individuals in the PDD that PTL had dealt with. But the witness answer was in the negative.
Then the Justice also questioned whether PTL had dealt with any individual in the Tender Board. Witness Palisenas answer was again negative.
PTL CEO Kasun Palisenas cross-examination will continue today regarding the deletion of phone conversations from PTLs voice recording system.
The PCoI comprising Justice K.T. Chitrasiri (Chairman), Justice Prasanna Jayawardena and Mr. Kandasami Velupillai will resume sittings at 10 am today. (Shehan Chamika Silva)

Physiotherapy for injuries
	
During activities done at home, at your workplace or at the play ground, anyone may experience an injury. Some of these injuries are, bruises, straining of tissues, fractures or dislocations. When faced with an injury, treatment known as RICE can be administered. Health Capsulespoke toDr. Jaliya Uduwella, Chief Physiotherapist Lady Ridgeway Hospital Colombo & President Chartered Society of Physiotherapy, to educate readers on this type of treatment. 
It is easy to remember when this treatment is explained in the following manner.
R - Rest 
I - Ice 
C - Compression 
E - Elevation 
First the injured area should be rested and not moved. Secondly get some ice cubes and wrap them in a peace of cloth. Use this now to foment the injured tissue. If there is internal bleeding or external bleeding, this treatment will help stop it. Nature of our body is such that vasoconstriction of the blood vessels occurs due to coldness. Then the flowing of blood will be stopped. Most people foment the injured area with hot water.
This shouldnt be done. When hot water is used, blood vessels get dilated and blood flows further to the tissue, making the blood clot larger. But after three (3) days following the injury, fomentation can be done with hot water. 

Most people fomenting the injured area with hot water. This shouldnt be done. When hot water is used, blood vessels get dilated and blood flows further to the tissue, making the blood clot larger.
As soon as the injury occurs foment the are with ice. Then the injured area must be compressed with the injured tissue in mind. The injured are must be bandaged with a crape bandage or a piece of cloth to avoid swelling. When this treatment is administered tissue fluid doesnt get accumulated. When using compression as part of the treatment the bandage should be tightened only to a certain extent. If during compression the bandage is tightened more, it may obstruct the circulation of blood. 
Thereafter the related area should be kept above the patients heart. The blood flow to the injured tissue reduces due to gravity. Then the venous blood disappears from that area quickly. If there is any bleeding, this also is controlled.

If there is a suspicion of a fracture, keep the area immovable by tying a splint and then visit a doctor. Under any circumstance if the nerves get damaged, the patients condition may worsen. The injured area may become permanently damaged. Therefore, dont attempt to readjust the broken bones or displaced joints at any time. 
If there is suspicion of a fracture related to the vertebral column, its better to keep the patient on a board and take him to the hospital. Dont allow the patient to sit. When carrying such patients get the support of at least four persons. 
After removing the plaster, put in place by the doctor during the treatment process, the movement of the joint, that was inactive for some time, may be limited. One might be able to witness wasting of muscles. To prevent muscles atrophy, physiotherapy instructions should be followed. This process is begun early when the patient is wearing the plaster. Here static exercises could be done without damaging the fractured bone. Care must be taken to contract the muscles and not move the fractured bone. If the muscles have thinned when the plaster is removed, muscle strengthening exercises should be done. If the joints range of motion is limited suspension therapy, introduced in physiotherapy, can be given. This is done by moving the patient to a posture to do exercises without feeling the gravity. If the joint has stiffened, heat treatment should be administered before physiotherapy.

Wijeyeratne, Kanishka Jayasinghe of CCC and SFG Manager Sustainability Assurance and Advisory Services Lakmini Senadheera

Peoples Leasing & Finance PLC (PLC), Sri Lankas market leader in leasing and a subsidiary of Peoples Bank, was recently awarded the internationally accredited CarbonNeutral certification by Natural Capital Partners (NCP) of the UK.
PLCs commitment to not only measure but to extend its efforts to lower the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of its organisational operations and subsequently neutralise its overall impact was essential in it reaching this critical milestone in the companys ongoing sustainability journey.
No stranger to carbon footprinting and offsetting, PLC has been a carbon neutral business entity for the past two years. However, having realised the need to step up its efforts to meet global standards, it recently contracted the countrys leading sustainability consultancy firm, The Carbon Consulting Company (CCC), to conduct a more in-depth assessment of its organisational carbon footprint that took into account applicable yet previously unconsidered emissions sources of their head office, branches, service centres and subsidiaries. Following the assessment, its results were independently verified by the Sustainable Future Group (SFG)  NCP UKs regional partner providing verification, validation and assurance services. Once verified, the SFG facilitated the investment in a renewable energy project in Sri Lanka, in return for which PLC was provided with a matching number of Carbon Credits to offset its carbon footprint.
Apart from the environmental benefits, this project has also contributed to the local economy and livelihood of residents through the creation of additional jobs and PLC is further bridging the gap between the local businesses and community projects to create a more sustainable future. As a result of this exhaustive audit, PLC was able to align itself to international standards for achieving carbon neutrality and was subsequently awarded CarbonNeutral Certification by the SFG on behalf of NCP UK.
CCC CEO Sanith de S. Wijeyeratne added, Were pleased that PLC wants to align itself with the globally recognised CarbonNeutral community. This is a huge step in showing others in their industry that the CarbonNeutral status can be achieved through strategic partnerships within the community. Sri Lanka as a country is realising the importance of governments and industries becoming aware of climate change and what can be done to mitigate its effects on people and the planet. PLC is just one step closer to aiding the change of the future of sustainability.
PLC CEO/GM Sabry Ibrahim stated, This internationally recognised certification for carbon neutrality is a testament to how we wish to position PLC as a responsible finance company in Sri Lanka. I would like to thank the Carbon Consulting Company for helping us through this process and we will continue the efforts that have now launched us on to an international platform in terms of protecting the planet.

prematurely
	
The process of producing a live human being starting from a single cell is fascinating. Its made even more amazing by the fact that each step is perfectly synchronized and happens during a specific time period. A foetus usually spends 38 weeks in the mothers womb. For each week, there are specific changes the foetus goes through, until he is ready to come out and face the world. If the baby is delivered between 37-42 weeks of gestation, that birth is called a term birth
But there are instances that things dont go according to plan and the baby has to come out early. They are called premature babies. Even though the survival rate of preemies is increasing continuously, thanks to the advancement of medicine, they have a harder time adapting to the outside world because they were delivered prematurely. So we decided to consult Dr. Deepal Perera, Consultant Pediatrician, Lady Ridgeway Childrens Hospital regarding premature babies. 


According to Dr. Perera, premature babies are defined as babies born below 37 weeks of gestation. These births are again sub divided into late preterm (Between 34-36 weeks), moderately preterm (32-34), Very preterm (less than 32 weeks) and Extremely preterm, (less than 25 weeks). The lesser the gestational age, the more severe the risk of complications because they are less adapted to the life outside the womb. Dr. Perera asserts that thanks to the advancement of medicine, babies born at 26 weeks of gestation are compatible with life in Sri Lanka. But weve seen many cases where 24-25 week babies have also survived, he states further. 
Possible complications
Still, the fact that they arent fully prepared to face the challenges of the outside world, when compared with term babies, cant be denied. These preemies are likely to have lower birth weight than is ideal, which might lead to complications. They are also more likely to suffer from Hypothermia, hypoglycaemia and feeding problems, said Dr. Perera. Hypothermia, a condition where the baby has abnormally lower body temperature, is because it doesnt have enough body fat to generate heat necessary to maintain the body temperature. In order to avoid this the baby is kept well covered, sometimes in an incubator until he can adapt to the environment, said Dr. Perera. 
Ever wondered how a baby automatically knows how to breast feed, soon after it is born This is due to a reflex action called suckling reflex, thats ingrained into them at birth. But in preemies, this reflex may not be fully developed. Therefore they are more likely to have feeding problems in the beginning. In that case they will sometimes have to be fed through a small tube, said Dr. Perera. Premature babies are also at a higher risk of getting hypoglycaemia, or low blood sugar, so they should be fed
more frequently. 
Our lungs are kept expanded with the help of a liquid called surfactant. Without surfactant the lung tissue would collapse on itself in expiration, making respiration difficult. This surfactant is produced in the last few weeks of gestation. Therefore prematurely born babies are more likely to suffer from Surfactant deficiency. This gives rise to a condition called Infant Respiratory Distress Syndrome, according to Dr. Perera. In these cases surfactant has to be given artificially and the baby may need ventilation until the issues are resolved, hefurther explained. 
Their immune system is also not matured as expected, resulting in premature babies being more prone to infections. So, the carers should always follow proper hand washing techniques and other hygienic measures when handling babies. Breast feeding is the ideal method of nutrition which reduces the risk of some infections in the gastrointestinal tract, even though this isnt practically possible in all cases. 
In addition to these they also have a higher chance of getting neonatal jaundice or yellowish discolouration of the skin and bleeding problems because their liver has yet to reach full maturity. 
Ever wondered how a baby automatically knows how to breast feed, soon after it is born This is due to a reflex action called suckling reflex, thats ingrained into them at birth. But in preemies, this reflex may not be fully developed.

Long term risks
Premature birth exposes babies to long term risk as well. They have a higher chance of developing hearing and vision problems, specifically a condition called Retinopathy Of Prematurity (ROP) and rickets. The incidence of Cerebral Palsy and learning disorders is also higher among preemies. So its important that premature babies have regular follow ups with a paediatrician even after they are discharged from hospital. This will aid in diagnosing any complications that arise and prevent them or if not, minimize their impact, according toDr. Perera. 
Care at home
When asked about how to care for the baby after being discharged from the hospital, Dr. Perera advised the carers to continue with good hygienic practices even at home. This he said will minimize the chance of catching infections. He advised to keep the baby warm by covering the head and the legs as well when the baby is taken outdoors. 
Its important to always keep notes on the growing progress of the baby. If any stage is unusually delayed, talk to your midwife or a healthcare provider. If any future ophthalmology or audiology are advised, follow them up on time. 
Prevention of preterm delivery
Is there any way of preventing preterm delivery Dr. Perera advised women who have had a history of more than one abortion or preterm deliveries to consult their obstetrician early during pregnancy. Some causes for preterm delivery can be treated, if identified early enough. said Dr. Perera. If the cause is something like the cervix being short, the cervix can be kept artificially closed. If the pregnant mother is having complications like pregnancy induced Diabetes Mellitus, Hypertension or infections then they have to be managed. Women experiencing multiple pregnancies also have a higher risk of going in to labour before term. Smoking is also found to have a relationship with preterm deliveries, so abstaining from smoking and preventing exposure to cigarette smoke,during pregnancy is improtant. 
If theres a risk that the baby will be born prematurely, its ideal that the delivery is done in a hospital with a good neonatal care unit to ensure the baby gets the maximum care, concluded Dr.Perera. 
Addition of a new member to the family is a wonderful experience. If that member decides to arrive a little earlier than expected, dont let that spoil your happiness as parents. Todays medicine has advanced rapidly and there is much that can be done to improve a challenging situation. Be alert, follow medical advice and enjoy the precious addition to your life.

Presidents daughter  pens story of a long journey
	
Janadhipathi Thaththa(my father, the President), a book authored by President Maithripala Sirisenas daughter, Chathurika Sirisena, will be launched on September 15 (Today) at 7.30 am at the Colombo International Book Fair 2017, BMICH, in Colombo. President Maithripala Sirisena will be chief guest at the book launch.
According to the author, the story is related from the point of view of the eldest daughter of a political leader. In the book she details her own experiences as well as the President Maithripala Sirisenas journey from a regional politician to the highest office in the country. 
The narrative goes into detail about the numerous challenges and obstacles that the current President had to overcome throughout his political journey as well as the experiences that the whole family endured. Written in the style of a literary fiction, the book reveals true to life incidents such as terrorist attacks that President Maithripala Sirisena survived as well as hereto untold details about the 2015 Presidential Elections. 
Chathurika is a graduate in Information Technology and performs people-friendly activities as a social activist. 
The book will be launched Todayat 7.30 amat the Colombo International Book Fair2017, at theBMICH
In a brief interview with the Daily Mirror, she said that the book would reveal untold details about the 2015 Presidential Elections. 
I had have already collected many newspaper articles written about my father by then, but my desire to write the book was expedited with emergence of my father as the common candidate for the Presidency-Chathurika Sirisena

Commenting on how she was inspired to pen a book about her father, she said, I was inspired to write a book about my father when he was awarded with the honorary title for the best Minister of Health in the World by the Harvard University while he was the Minister of Health. The pride and esteem that were etched in my mind from this day onwards drove me to the task of writing about him.
It was also my intention to teach my children about my proud father through my potential for writing. 
I had have already collected many newspaper articles written about my father by then, but my desire to write the book was expedited with emergence of my father as the common candidate for the Presidency. 
By this time many who were with us were deserting us. Those who helped us earlier ignored us. Instead many new friends gathered around us. During this short period of one and half months, my life presented me with different experiences. This new environment drove me fast to write the book that was already in my mind, she said. 
I had the practice of reading books in the shelves of my fathers room. He used to buy a book on most Fridays. Books on biographies, history and novels were among the various books on the shelves. I had the opportunity to read most of these books before by father read them. I also found diaries maintained by my father and I could collect more matters from these diaries too, she said. 
Janadhipathi Thaththa consists of several chapters that are reserved to detail memories of his childhood, youth, political life and other important happenings. 
My father Maithripala Sirisena joined the Sri Lanka Freedom Party at the age of 16. Since then he has been involved in political activities under leaders like Sirimavo Bandaranaike, Chandrika Kumaratunga and Mahinda Rajapaksa.
I have included my memories about my father, the president, from all these areas, she said. The book highlights the success of a positive thinker. Chathurika said that her father was born to a common farmer family. My father gradually climbed the rungs of the social ladder. We never thought that our father would become the President of the country. There was no such environment to think on these lines. But his resolve and endurance drove him to shatter all the obstacles that scattered his path. My book is not a mere biography. I wrote it in a form of novel and I would prefer you to read it as a novel, she concluded.

psychological disorders
	
Lets take a closer look at

If you feel uncomfortable in crowds the reason might be one of these!
	This will help you figure out whether the complaint made by your loved one is just a normal fear ora phobia...
Agoraphobia and Social Phobia (social anxiety disorder) are two different psychological disorders, which are closely related, but having a thin line differentiating the two. This makes it quite difficult to distinguish one from the other.We are all shy and fear certain moments. At times we feel uncomfortable when moving with a crowd. But some people experience these feelings in a profound manner. Such feelings affect the quality of their lives. 
Today we are going to talk about Agoraphobia and Social Phobia. This will help you figure out whether the complaint made by your loved one is just a normal fear ora phobia.

What is Agoraphobia
Agoraphobia means that an individual has a fear of leaving home (home-bound). People with such a condition fear being in places or situations from which the escape would be hard or embarrassing in case of a panic attack or medical emergency. 

What is Social Phobia
Social phobia, which is the fear of facing the society, is characterized by undue shyness and showing anxiety when in unfamiliar social gatherings. People with such a condition avoid interaction. For an example, these people will not fear to jog alone on the beach as long as there are no people watching. But they get restless when walking in to a crowded cocktail-party. 

If a person experiences symptoms of anxiety and avoidance only during social performance, it is highly likely to be Social phobia. However, if the individual tends to experience the same panic symptoms anywhere outside his familiar comfortable zone the diagnosis will be more
towards Agoraphobia. 


How to differentiate the two
The nature of fearful feelings that makes them avoid crowds is categorized in to two types. This makes the clinical diagnosis easier.
The main difference between these two conditions has been identified as the nature of fearful feelings. These feelings make the individual avoid certain types of situations. 
People with Agoraphobia, often avoid public or open places full of people. Such people avoid trains, buses, fairs, carnivals etc. They would prefer staying at home alone or in the company of a trusted companion. They differ from people with Social Phobia who will move in society, but try their best to avoid interaction with others. People who prefer less interactions fancy engaging in things alone. By doing so they can talk less and be less friendlier. They might also want to avoid being in the presence of close companions as well. They also have a feeling that others will notice their trembling and sweaty hands or shaky voice while having conversations. Because of these dislikes they get distressed. Some even experience disturbances in the gastrointestinal system. 
In contrast to that, Agoraphobic people dislike taking the chance of walking alone anywhere. This is because they have the fear of being helpless in case they experience a panic attack. 

Agoraphobia means that an individual has a fear of leaving home (home-bound).
Social phobia, which is the fear of facing the society, is characterized by undue shyness and showing anxiety when in unfamiliar social gatherings.

Behavior patterns
Real life applications can describe these two conditions so well.
A long hall with less walls, rows of people, driving alone, being far away from home or a restroom or even standing outside their own home are definite nightmares for Agoraphobic people. They will never want to walk in to places like that since they an unfamiliar territories for them. 
Once they return to their normal and familiar places, it will be so relaxing for them that they feel relieved. Social phobic people dont demarcate places they visit. The only thing they worry about is, being criticized or rejected. They have these scary and insecure feelings in their mind that people will make fun of them, will watch how they behave and observe what they are doing. Because of these reasons they will even avoid speaking, writing, eating, using wash rooms in public, making eye contact with people around them, acting friendly, look up and will ultimately walk away if possible. 
On the other hand, the symptoms of anxiety, dizziness, sweating, tachycardia and palpitation developing in Agoraphobic people are usually unrelated to what they are doing. But, there is a possibility of these people developing fearful thoughts of being scrutinized by others in case they develop panic symptoms, in public.
When psychiatrists work on trying to establish a diagnosis of the condition, a detailed history of the patient is crucial. Information obtained from the patient as well as from a close friend or a family member will be helpful, in some circumstances. This is in order to arrive at an exact conclusion. 
If a person experiences symptoms of anxiety and avoidance only during social performance, it is highly likely to be Social phobia. However, if the individual tends to experience the same panic symptoms anywhere outside his familiar comfortable zone the diagnosis will be more
towards Agoraphobia. 

Take home message
However, in both disorders, individuals will experience similar symptoms associated with anxiety and panic. They will follow a behavioral pattern of avoidance and most importantly will try their level best to create safe zones, based on the nature offears experienced. 
After all these steps will make them less worried, relaxed, calm and comfortable. As far as the method of treatment for both disorders is considered, different and personalized courses of cognitive behavioral therapy will definitely do miracles.

PTL counsel interrupts cross examination of Palisena
	
A heated argument took place during the PCoI proceedings yesterday when PTL lawyer Nihal Fernando PC attempted to continuously interrupt during the cross-examination conducted by DSG Gunatilleke on PTL CEO Kasun Palisena.
While DSG Gunatilleke was questioning the witness, Mr. Fernando PC on several times tried to indicate answers to those questions before the witness gave answers. But the DSG objected to that and emphasized let the witness talk not the counsel.
However, after a while, when DSG Gunatilleke questioned the witness, Mr. Fernando attempted to explain matters to the Commission again.
DSG Gunatilleke: Mr. Fernando dont disturb the questioning
ASG de Livera: Now what is your problem (Asked in an aggressive manner from Mr. Fernando)
Nihal Fernando PC: No problem
ASG De Livera: Then shut up!
At this point Chairman of the Commission Justice Chitrasiri and Commissioner Justice Prasanna Jayawardena criticized the word (shut up) used by the ASG.
ASG De Livera said the line of cross-examining has come to a crucial point at that moment and PTLs counsel was interrupting trying to indicate certain things to the witness by intervening in the questioning.
However, Justice Chitrasiri said if that was the case, the ASG should inform it to the Commission in a decent manner not using such inappropriate words.
Justice Jayawardena remarked that the ASGs behavior was uncouth and not acceptable.
ASG De Livera then said: I had to intervene in this because he has been doing this all the time and this commission had not absorbed it so far.
Justice Jayawardena then said that the behavior of the ASG does not suite to an Acting Solicitor General.
ASG Livera said, Now.. PTLs lawyer had been indicating things systematically to the witness during the cross-examination, so is that behavior pardonable
Justice Jayawardena: Then tell him not to interrupt
ASG: I told him.
At this point Mr. Nihal Fernando PC also engaging in the argument began to elaborate what he was about to say.
However, both DSG Gunetilleke and ASG Livera aggressively prevented counsel Fernando from further expressing himself.
Concluding the heated argument then Justice Jayawardena told Mr. Fernando PC:
There are two matters here. One is you cannot interrupt when DSG Gunetilleke is cross-examining the witness and the behavior of ASG Livera is another matter. Justice Jayawarane thereafter asked the DSG to continue. (Shehan Chamika Silva)

If the government is not ready to close down SAITM we are ready to close down the government with the people's power, Parliamentarian Sunil Handunnetti said today.
He said there were no multiple solutions to resolve the controversy and the only solution was to topple the government.
If the Government does not accept the defeat tomorrow and close down the SAITM, the JVP will use its full force to send the government home, he said addressing the anti-SAITM parade in Colombo today.
Mr. Handunnetti also stressed that Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne, Higher Education Minister Lakshman Kiriella and Social Empowerment Minister S. B. Dissanayake had been blacklisted and were removed unconditionally from the people's hearts.
He further said that it was true that people, pedestrians and patients were inconvenienced by trade union actions but the country's state of medical education, especially the education of the poor parents' children would be ruined if the struggle failed.
"We should not be concerned about temporary inconveniences caused during the trade union actions if we are truly concerned about free education in the country. This struggle is to safeguard the education right of even your unborn child," he said. (Thilanka Kankarathna)

Muhurthas for marriage and marital happiness-part 2


In our previous article on the subject, we referred to ancient Indian sage Vashistas assertion that the marriage Navamsa Ascendant is more important than the marriage Rashi Ascendant in the context of producing results relating to Muhurthas.
Muhurtha results in different Rashi and Navamsa Ascendants
The principles Kalidasa enunciates in his work titled Purvakalmrita lends support to what Vashista has said. Kalidasa says that the marriage occurring in the Aries Navamsa is destined to end in separation. Marriage in Taurus Navamsa bestows wealth and prosperity on the bride. In Cancer Navamsa she turns unfaithful. In Leo Navamsa, the bride spends more time at the parental home than with her husband.
In Virgo Navamsa, the bride gains wealth and spiritual advancement. Marriage in this Navamsa, assures a virtuous bride who brings forth sons who would hold key positions in the administration of the state. The bride in Scorpio Navamsa becomes poor and is neglected by her husband and all others. In Sagittarius up to 15 degrees, she gains wealth and in the second part of Sagittarius she becomes unchaste. In Capricorn, she is uncouth and is disliked by others. In Aquarius, she becomes a sickly person and an early widow. In Pisces, she is childless and miserable. 
Muhurtha Chintamani, a classical work on Muhurthas recommends only Gemini, Libra and Sagittarius and Pisces as auspicious Navamsa Ascendants.
Exceptions to general Muhurtha Lagna rule
Aries, Cancer, Pisces and second part of Sagittarius - from 16 to 30 degrees are considered inauspicious for Muhurthas both as Rashi and Navamsa Ascendants, according to ancient treatises on Muhurtha. However, ancient works on Muhurthas, Muhurtha Martanda these three signs become auspicious if they are Vargottama. However, it has to be noted that Pisces Ascendant falling between 20 degrees 40 Kalas and 30 degrees and 6 Kalas is malefic and this period should be avoided in selecting a Muhurtha.
Libra is normally considered auspicious as both marriage Muhurtha Ascendant and Navamsa Ascendant. However, according to Muhurtha Martanda, Vargottama Libra is bad for marriage.
Pushkaramsa
There are specifically benefic degrees of signs called Subha Pushkaramsas which are auspicious as Muhurthas. In Aries, Leo and Sagittarius 21 degrees is Subha Pushkaramsa. In Taurus, Virgo and Capricorn 14 degrees is the Subha Pushkaramsa. In Gemini, Libra, and Aquarius 24 degrees and in Cancer Scorpio and Pisces 9 degrees are the Pushkaramsa.
Virgo Ascendant, best for Muhurthas
According to all ancient Indian sages, Virgo is the best Ascendant of all the 12 signs. So we now know that we cannot select a better Muhurtha than that falls in the 14 degrees in the 14 degrees of the Virgo Ascendant. However, even such a Muhurtha becomes inauspicious if Mars happens to be in the 8th House.
Kranti Samya Dosha
Sun and Moon transiting in Zodiacal signs cause the Kranti Samya Dosha. This Dosha is considered highly detrimental to marriage.
Kranti Samya Dosha is caused when:
Sun is in Leo and Moon is in Aries.
Either Sun or Moon is in a Chara (Movable) Rashi, the other is in the 9th from it or Either Sun or Moon is in Diviswabha - Common sign, the other is in the 7th Rashi from it.

Students die trapped in Malaysia school fire
	

Two dozen children, some just seven years old, died in a fire at a religious boarding school in Malaysia early yesterday. 
The fire started in one of the bedrooms on the third floor of the Darul Quran Ittifaqiyah Tahfiz Centre in Kuala Lumpur. 
Most of the victims -23 children and two adults -were asleep in their dormitories when the fire broke out.The room in which the fire started -20ft by 40ft- was said by a fire brigade spokesman, quoted by the New Straits Times, to have been littered with charred bodies. 
At least 15 bodies were found huddled together on another floor, it was reported. 
Some of the children who died were aged as young as seven, others were in their mid-teens.

A survivor told how there was chaos, with fire preventing students from escaping from the sweeping blaze. 
In the hours after the fire, family members rushed to the scene, only for some to be told that their child had died in the blaze. 
Mourning parents could be seen standing outside the school as emergency services tended to the scene. 
Muhammad Roslan, 15, told the New Straits Times when I woke up, fire had already engulfed the front door, he said.I broke a window and grabbed a pipe attached to the outside of the building and used it to escape to the ground, he said.

Suppression  of depression
	
Health is wealth is a phrase in which every word is deemed true. While WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION defines health as physical, mental, social and spiritual well-being, mental health is something that isnt always considered. As lightly as it is thought of, mental health issues have turned into a malady monster threatening the well-being of many lives. From a long list of mental maladies, depression has emerged a trending topic that has grasped much attention world wide. More and more people are falling victim to depression everyday. Depression has created a cause for concern. Depression is referred to as the third common illness which has affected lives globally. This is known as a non-communicable disease and has plagued the society. This issue was addressed by Dr. M. Sakthilandran of the District General Hospital, Chilaw at the Brahma Kumaris Raja Yoga Centre, Dehiwala recently. The doctor provided an in depth explanation on the medical malady, the ins and outs of depression and stated that it is completely curable. 

Definition
According to Dr. Sakthilandran, it is a disorder that can affect our day to day activities. It doesnt imply the depletion of happiness. Instead it is the inability to experience or express happiness. Depression is a mood disorder, he said. Depression is said to occur when there is a change in the concentration of neuro-chemicals in the brain. 
How severe
is it
Depression is devastating, deteriorating as well as disabling. But fortunately it is completely curable. It is a disorder that is easily treated through treatment. Successful therapies are available as treatment. But only less than 10 of patients opt for treatment. 
Dr. Sakthilandran stated that nearly 300 million are affected worldwide by depression. One in eight people are affected by depression. More females fall victim to depression than men, he explained. 
Tell-tale signs
Sometimes other conditions can be confused with depression. These conditions may develop into complications. There are over-treated cases too. With these cases another mental condition had been misinterpreted as depression. Therefore it is of vital importance to diagnose depression properly. 
Three classic symptoms of the disease were accentuated by the doctor. They are; a persistent low mood, lack of interest in things or lack of enjoyment and the lack of energy.
If you seem to suffer from these three symptoms, chances are you suffer from depression. Next you should check whether you suffer from other symptoms to confirm the disorder. The other symptoms include lack of sleep, disturbed sleep, awakening early, excessive sleep, inability to awaken fresh from sleep, poor concentration, low self esteem, poor appetite, overeating, suicidal ideas, attempts at suicide, agitation, guilt, and self blaming, he explained.
The severity of depression can be diagnosed by grading oneself in relation to the symptoms. If a person suffers from less than 3 symptoms, there is no danger of depression. If a person suffers from four symptoms, mild depression is a possibility. If a person suffers from 5-6 symptoms then he may suffer from moderate depression. But if symptoms exceed 7, then depression is of a severe state. 
Main causes 
Death of a beloved, failure in occupation, financial burden, separation from family and family problems are stated as precipitating causes for depression.


Other risk factors
Dr. Sakthilandran listed out some other risk factors known to cause depression.
Hereditary factors, stresses which include childhood stress due to repeated negative experiences, excess workload, work without relaxation, chronic pain, chronic illnesses such as arthritis, hypothyroidism, diabetes, long term pain, heart diseases, stroke, career, factors that affect brain organically, poor social support and living alone, alcohol and narcotic abuse, side effects of medication and other environmental factors give way to depression,he elaborated.
Types
According to Dr. Sakthilandran, there are several types of depression. This includes major or uni-polar depression, persistent depressive disorder, bi-polar depression, seasonal affective disorder, psychotic depression, postpartum depression, dementia syndrome depression, post stroke depression, endocrine related depression and post traumatic stress disorder. The most extreme stage of depression is known as depressive stupor where the patient abstains from taking food and drink. In this state the person doesnt show emotion. This poses a fatal risk where the patient could face death. In these cases a shock or ECT-Electro Convulsive Therapy- is recommended to save the patient,he explained.
Treatment
It is accepted that treatment is essential to overcome depression. This disorder is curable. A patient can recover successfully following proper treatment. Treat early, Treat fully, Prevent relapses is what Dr. Sakthilandran referred to as treatment. 
However the medical officer warned that if treatment is discontinued early, the next attack of depression could be severe.  Treatments include medicinal drugs, psychotherapy, ECT and also lifestyle modifications. Lifestyle modifications include exercise, meditation, music, trips, engaging in hobbies, sleep, sports, avoiding alcohol and narcotics, consumption of nutritious healthy food, spending time with family and friends and social services,he said.
By taking steps to prevent depression one is taking a step closer to a healthy life.

The cane: Our children as our priority
	
The problem with our justice system, in general and over the years, has been its blatant lack of regard for the specific needs of children
Children, taken initially as flouters of the law, were transformed into victims via a justice system
Corporal punishment, however worrisome it is to me, belongs by default to the private sphere, encompassing student leaders, teachers, principals, and entire institutions
Last Sunday (September 10), I woke up earlier than my mother, who woke up so late that breakfast delayed meant my schedule for the day would be delayed. I dont resolve to travel during weekends; those are the only two days during the week that I spend at home. But September 10, no different to all other Sundays in September, was special. To me. Somewhere in Colombo, an organisation was about to hold its inaugural forum. This forum, I got to more than an hour after it started. What I heard and what had I missed, despite the inconvenience of a late, hurried breakfast, has stuck with me to this day, because I had known that this organisation would be initiated a few months back. 
Before that, though, a perusal of some facts and figures. Records in 2012 show 758 children who were sexually molested and another 745 who were sexually abused. There were nine cases of incest by a family member, in addition 22 cases of child murders, 54 child abductions, 10 attempted murders, and 247 cases of child assault. From 2011 to 2012, the National Child Protection Agency (NCPA) collected more than 20,000 complaints, an almost unprecedented amount. Why do these matter Because this organization, through that forum on Sunday, seeks to combat instances of gross neglect, wanton abuse, and irrational complacency that make up our justice system when it comes to our number one priority: our children, our next generation. 
There are fundamental differences between fairness and expedience with respect to the legal system of a country. This approximates to the wider differences between an individual and a collective in any given society: put simply, the interests of the former can and will be weighed against the interests of the latter, which is why we talk of the greater good and the lesser evil. The conflict or rather conflicts between these two can and must be balanced out, so as to ensure a) due process and b) fair hearings for everyone. What gets missed out here, however, is that perpetrators are often victims of abuse, and the victims of today can well become the perpetrators of tomorrow. 
The problem with our justice system, in general and over the years, has been its blatant lack of regard for the specific needs of children. On two fronts at least, our children have become conditioned to accept, to conform, to set aside those notions of individuality that make up who they are: the cane and the court. 
I am less interested in the former than I am in the latter, but for the purposes of my column I will delve through both. Beginning with this: in a culture that privileges deference to and absolution of ultimate authority (whatever that authority may be), children are inadvertently taught about two kinds of citizens: those who wield the baton (the perpetrators) and those who resist it (the victims). The problem, obviously, is that the fine line between these two can, and more often than not does, get blurred. 
Take the problem of corporal punishment. Our statutes are discernibly ambivalent over the issue. Article 82 of the Penal Code of 1883, for instance, absolves a guardian (or any person acting as such lawfully) when he or she inflicts punishment on a child, if that act of inflicting the punishment is committed in good faith. 
Now in good faith is probably one of the vaguest legal phrases out there. Despite the later reforms which invaded the Penal Code (not least being Article 308A, which explicitly provided for the offence of cruelty against children), there were subtle exceptions that shielded teachers whenever they chose to inflict punishment (Article 314, for instance, which is about the offence of criminal force, conveniently inserts a caveat: a schoolmaster in the reasonable exercise of his discretion as master who flogs a student is not, for all intents and purposes, committing that offence). 
Its this concurrent, confused attitude of support for and opposition to corporal punishment (whether inflicted by hand or through a weapon) which has coloured the contemporary discourse on the topic for so long. Even now, its so confused that all it has done is sustain a dichotomy within our society. 
Lets not forget that no less a person than the president, in a speech delivered last year, gave an instance where he had been caned for a mistake committed by another child. A friend of mine, having heard this, informed me that when such erroneous crimes go unpunished, they add to a society where even upholders of the law either punish suspected offenders or blow trivial misdemeanours out of proportion and torture those suspects. A quick perusal of Basil Fernandos harrowing Narrative of Justice in Sri Lanka will convince anyone that this country, a paradise to many and a hellhole to some, is chock-a-block with glaring instances of disproportionate punishments. 
So while were at it, here are some other points. Pertinent points. Like the fact that the sections in the Penal Code absolving teachers were authored by Englishmen, not natives. Or the fact that inasmuch as various Circulars issued by those in charge of our education policy (in particular, the Circulars of 1907 and of 1927, the latter being the first such issued by the Education Department on the subject) regulated the use of the cane and limited it to glaring instances of indiscipline, calls for abolition came much, much later, and could hardly be said to be Westernised. That is why some believe that the culture of caning students excessively, like our puritanical attitude to sex, divorce, and love, was a result of enlightened laws drafted by Victorian men. 
Heres what I wrote last year on this; they may have been, or are you for the calls for reform made by bodies that have evolved considerably from the Victorian Era Or in still other words, would you prefer to remain Westernised in the Victorian sense of that term or Westernised in the modern, civilised sense of that term
That final question, despite the fact that I abhor simplification of any sort in whatever conversation and argument, is what makes out for the resolution of this debate. 
Corporal punishment, however worrisome it is to me, belongs by default to the private sphere, encompassing student leaders, teachers, principals, and entire institutions. The other problem belongs to the public sphere, and therefore bothers me even more; the lack of a proper system of juvenile justice in this country. 
Before I move into that issue (which I leave for next weeks column), though, a word about that forum I attended last Sunday. Former President Chandrika Kumaratunga, invited as the Chief Guest, and in response to the statistic that one in four children in the country have been abused, exclaimed, surprised despite herself and her own experience in the field (it was under her regime that the NCPA was formed, lets not forget). Perfect summing up, I thought to myself, as I reflected on the many instances in which children, taken initially as flouters of the law, were transformed into victims via a justice system that, following a rather misconceived education sector that confuses unconditional deference for respect, treats them like the adults they are not. The organisation behind that forum, incidentally, was the Child Protection Force. More on that, and the main objectives it seeks to achieve, next week.

Therefore, even if other main lines on the hand go missing, the Head line would not. It would be absent only in a very rare case.

Affinity between Head Line and Life Line
There is a close affinity between life and the brain. One cannot survive without the other. Besides, life is worthless without the benefits of the products of the brain, wisdom and intelligence. Therefore, Life line and the Head line assume equal importance.

Location and formation
The Head line very often commences from the point of origin of the Life line and reaches the other side of the palm after running through the Mars plain. In certain cases, it starts below the Mount of Jupiter and also at various points lower down the Life line. In most cases, this line runs towards the percussion in a sloping line.
Given its importance, the Head line should be long, deep and distinct, if it is to signify favorable results. If it is even slightly defective, it would signify a great setback in the life of the subject. The Head line does not appear to have a fixed starting point. The formation of this line falls into the following five main types:
1. It commences from the starting point of the Life line. And runs through the centre after cutting the Life line, to reach the percussion.
2. It stops after reaching the centre of the palm having commenced from near the source of the Life line.
3. It changes its course after running parallel to the Life line for a long distance.
4. It reaches the other side after commencing from near the Life line dividing the palm into two parts.
5. The Head line and the Life line appear to run merged into one.
Head line similar to No. 1 is not favourable because the line proceeding after cutting the Life line foreshadows an accident. Such a subject would be sick and weak. He would be hot-tempered and would act rashly to his own detriment. He would have few friends and some of them would cheat him in his hour of need.
No. 2: Head line indicates that the subject would surely attain an important position in life. Such a person is capable of taking quick decisions and would take advantage of every opportunity that comes his way. He is endowed with a sharp intelligence and would attain success through travels.
No: 3: Head line indicates that the subject is clever and efficient and he possesses self-confidence. He has more than one source of income. He succeeds in life by the dint of perseverance.
No: 4: Head line indicates the subject would go abroad several times in his life time. He would amass wealth through foreign trade or foreign sources.
No: 5: Head line shows the subject is cruel and is devoid of humane feelings. This type of Head line is often seen in the hands of criminals like murderers.

General indications
When the Head line starts quite apart from the Life line, the subject would be full of self-confidence. He would be somewhat conceited too. The Head line widely separated from the Life line signifies that the subject is reckless and careless.
The Head line originating from the Mount of Jupiter shows that the subject is ambitious, self-reliant, and self-confident and is capable of leadership.

They need you to escape from the tunnels of despair
	
Sometimes you would feel that the world has stood still. It could be due to the loss of a loved one, job or any other reason that would deplete all your energies. We like to view things positively, but sometimes a few of us dont have all the courage to do so. World Suicide Prevention Day for 2017 drew to an end last Sunday. But the issue isnt solved yet. Public dialogue, intervention and policy decisions need to be implemented and vulnerable groups need to be identified and approached. Hence, theres more work to be done in terms of keeping people employed, strengthening social relationships and preventing them from being isolated. 
Several of these matters were discussed at a press conference held recently in view of World Suicide Prevention Day. The panelists were
Sri Lanka Sumithrayo Chairperson Kumudini De Silva, Kalubowila Teaching Hospital Consultant Psychiatrist Dr. Malika Weerasinghe and University of Colombo Senior Professor and Sociologist Siri Hettige.
Join Sri Lanka Sumithrayo and help change a life-Kumudini De Silva
In her opening remarks Sri Lanka Sumithrayo Chairperson Kumudini De Silva, said that a better public dialogue is needed to address the topic of suicide. Close to one million people commit suicide and that means even at this moment, there are people attempting it or have already been killed. In 1985 Sri Lanka topped the suicide list, but lately we have been relegated to fourth place according to the latest statistics. But we cant be happy about this rank as well. As a society that speaks a lot about health issues. We need to speak more and raise awareness on depression. Suicide is a complex problem and many factors come in to account and these include social, biological, environmental and psychological reasons. Back in 1974, Joan De Mel, a member of Samaritans for over 12 years, wanted to relieve those who consider suicide as an option and hence opened the first Befrienders International/ Samaritans worldwide branch and named it Sri Lanka Sumithrayo. Today we have over 10 branches in Sri Lanka. We offer services to rural communities as well. We have observed that the tendency to commit suicide is higher in rural communities and we are happy to extend our services to them. We have an office in Jaffna as well because there are people who are traumatized by the war, she said.
Speaking further De Silva said that the services offered by Sri Lanka Sumithrayo are absolutely free, but the volunteer service is quite challenging. Its difficult to obtain human resources and we would like to invite those interested to join us and help someone to change a life. We dont have time for others. But if someone wants to talk to you, but you dont have time and eventually that person decides to commit suicide, you will later regret. So join with us and help change a life, said De Silva.
Social problems have no medication-Prof. Siri Hettige
University of Colombo Senior Professor and Sociologist Siri Hettige said in this age of technology everything could be obtained at the click of a button. Suicide has a pattern. Family problems, poverty, socio-economic issues, chronic illnesses, relationships and alcoholism are a few reasons. If we take social relationships, we know that females dont take as much alcohol as males and therefore its a protective factor. When males get together they consume alcohol and here we see that social integration is poor. This is one of the causes of isolation. Unemployed people are another vulnerable group because they are helpless. Doctors usually treat the root cause of any condition, but in this case we see only the tip of the iceberg.
Suicide has a pattern. Family problems, poverty, socio-economic issues, chronic illnesses, relationships and alcoholism are a few reasons.
Theres a greater population hiding behind doors simply because of stigma and cultural boundaries. Social problems have no medication and suicide has multiple causations. We need to take a policy decision to address this issue and intervention is required in many levels especially through socio-economic strategies. There are many FM channels, TV stations, newspapers and other mediums that exist and given such a set-up how can we develop a concentrated public discourse Many things need to be done, but when social bonds erode, suicide and other social issues become abundant,opined Prof. Hettige.
Everyone wouldnt have a good problem-solving mind-set- Dr. Malika Weerasinghe
Kalubowila Teaching Hospital Consultant Psychiatrist Dr. Malika Weerasinghe, who is specialized in Clinical and Adolescent psychiatry, said that the numbers exceed 15 cases when comparing the situations in 1995 and 2016. In 1995, there were 47 cases of suicide in every 1,000,000 people, but in 2016 it has reduced to 28. But still that is a high rate. Although we only speak about suicide, we also have to focus on the cases of attempted suicide. Hence its important to take cases of poisoning and self-inflicted harm too into account. Reasons such as family conflicts, relationship issues, work place issues, exams and even anger and shame could make someone helpless. As a result people may have weaker coping strategies and would think of alternatives such as consuming alcohol and may develop psychological conditions such as depression. This is mainly because everyone doesnt have a good problem-solving mind-set. Some people may have borderline personality disorders, Attention-Deficit Hyperactive Disorder (ADHD), depression and other complications. Suicide could happen due to psychological problems or trauma. During the recent past we also saw an increase in teen suicide rates and this is mainly due to copycat syndrome. Sometimes it could also be considered an epidemic, Dr. Weerasinghe said.

Elaborating on what could be done in order to prevent people from developing suicidal thoughts Dr. Weerasinghe said that skills development should be commenced from childhood. This in turn would help people to control their anger because they can be occupied. In addition to that people should be trained on effective problem solving, self-esteem development and even developing strong interpersonal relationships. Parents have a big role to play in shaping their childrens life and therefore have to develop a stronger connection with each other. Emotional intelligence is another aspect that needs to be given more attention. If you think you have a problem dont be afraid to talk about it. It necessarily doesnt have to be someone at Sri Lanka Sumithrayo, but if you have close friends or a relatives, do talk to them. Depression aggravates from mild to a severe condition and in such an instance anybody would feel helpless. Its also important to be non-judgmental in this situation because the moment you judge they would feel even more helpless. Theres a cultural stigma attached to psychological problems especially in Sri Lanka and therefore we have to help them step out of their sorrows,Dr. Weerasinghe added.

Union Bank becomes SLs first bank to receive PCI DSS certification
	
Marking a significant turning point in data security protection, Union Bank became the first bank in Sri Lanka to receive the international payment card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) by the Security Standards Council.
The PCI Security Standards Council is a global forum for the ongoing development, enhancement, storage, dissemination and implementation of security standards for account data protection. The PCI certification is a robust assurance of Union Banks data security standards across all systems and processes through which card and account transactions are effected. 
Commenting on the achievement, Union Bank Chief Executive Officer Indrajit Wickramasinghe said, We are pleased to announce this significant security certification, which is another industry first by Union Bank. The security of card and account data is of crucial importance to us as a financial institution.
The breach or theft of card/account holder data would adversely affect the entire payment card ecosystem where customers would lose trust in merchants or financial institutions and in turn business would get negatively affected.
As a progressive bank that places greater focus on tech-enabled customer touch points, Union Bank is committed to advocating the highest levels of data security and following PCI security standards confirms our commitment to good business practices. The security benefits associated with maintaining PCI compliance are vital to the long-term success of the bank as well as our customers.
The PCI Standard Certification includes continual identification of threats and vulnerabilities that could potentially impact the organisation. Such standards help ensure healthy and trustworthy payment card transactions for the multitudes of customers that maintain accounts linked to cards and credit facilities.

Heavy traffic was reported in Colombo today because of a vehicle parade oraganised by the GMOA and several other groups calling for a solution to the SAITM controversy.
GMOA Secretary Haritha Aluthge said they would launch a countrywide joint trade union action on Thursday if the government did not provide a reasonable solution to this matter even after the vehicle parade.
The vehicle parade which began on Tuesday from five districts reached Colombo today. We have also launched a district-wise work stoppage during the past few days against SAITM, he said,
Dr. Aluthge urged the government to solve this SAITM controversy without further delay and said students attached to State universities and SAITM and several others were inconvenienced because the government was not solving this longstanding matter.
He said they would be forced resort to trade union action on Thursday if the government failed to provide them with a people-friendly solution and that they would await a positive response from the government before Thursday.
Meanwhile, Dr. Aluthge said that by refusing to register SAITM graduates the British General Medical Council (GMC) had also supported the GMOAs views on SAITM. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)

When JRJ sang Silent Night  66 yrs ago in San Francisco
	
The 111th birth anniversary of Junius Richard Jayewardene (JRJ) and the 66th anniversary of Treaty of Peace with Japan falls on 17th and 16th September respectively. He quoted the Buddha, Nahi verena verani Hatred ceases not by hatred, but by love at Treaty of Peace with Japan Conference on September 16, 1951
Mr. Paulusz [class teacher] called me the Rankest slacker in the class. I was much cut up; how does he know ..,  Well I will show him before I die that the Rankest Rotter has done his bit in the world. This remark shall be my start for greater work. :
15 yr-old JRJ in his
Diary - June 9, 1922
Admitted to Bishops College Nursery, little Dick [Richard] left the girls school at six; the eleven kids were brought up in the English style Anglicans at EW Jayewardenes home. Dick got the first part of his name after paternal uncle Junius Quintus J.and Richard after Don Richard Wijewardene, the younger brother of the mother. 
The Judge of the Supreme Court saw his son join the Colombo Academy [as Royal College was then known]. Strangely he didnt excel academically up to Junior Matriculation. In fact he languished a couple of years in the same form. 
In San Francisco 
JRJ not only made a mark as an orator at the Conference on the Treaty of Peace with Japan  addressing an assembly of 52 nations in 1951-but shone as a singer. He entertained diplomats when Sri Lankas ambassador, Sir Claude Corea, gave a reception after the conference. JRJ sang O Come All Ye Faithful and Silent Night, the favourite Christmas carols. He became a friend of the Japanese people at the Peace Treaty held in San Francisco, US.
However, in his preteen years, JRJ was very much the leader among nine junior siblings, plus the cousins of two families who lived in close proximity to Park House, the rambling mansion on a two and a half acre land at Cinnamon Gardens. They all respected his great skills at organizing games like races and wheeling old car tires.  JR Jayewardene of SL- A Political Biography by Prof KM de Silva
I consider it a great opportunity to be afforded the opportunity of placing before this assembly of fifty-one nations the views of the Government of Ceylon on the draft Treaty of Peace which we have been invited to approve. My statement will consist of the reasons for our acceptance of this treaty, and I shall also attempt to meet some of the criticisms that have been levelled against it. It is true that I can speak only on behalf of my Government, but I claim that I can voice the sentiments of the people of Asia in their general attitude towards the future of Japan. I need not deal with the events that led to the formulation of the final draft of the treaty which we are considering. Mr. Dulles, the American representative, and Mr. Kenneth Younger, the British representative, have given us a full and fair account of those events, beginning with the capitulation of Japan in August 1945. It may, however, be mentioned that there was a serious conflict of opinion between the four major powers as to the procedure that should be adopted to draft this treaty. --Speech at San Francisco- JRJ Centre Archives
Women mobbed J.R. Jayewardene in the streets during the San Francisco Peace Conference seeking his autograph and though he obliged them as far as possible, in his own inimitable way, there came a point when the Police and the FBI had to step in. One policeman even warned JRJ that if he didnt move, he would have to spend the whole night signing autographs. -Says Roshan Peiris, quoting Veteran foreign correspondent H.B.W. Abeynaike, in our sister paper Sunday Times of Nov. 17, 1996
The Soviet Union led by Russia proposed that the freedom of Japan should be limited. It wanted restrictions on the right of Japan to maintain a defence force. JRJ continued On the main question of the freedom of Japan, we were able to agree ultimately, and the treaty embodies that agreement. On the other matters, there were sharp differences of opinion, and the treaty embodies the majority views. My Government would have preferred it if some of those questions were answered in a different way, but the fact that the majority dont agree with us is no reason why we should abstain from signing the treaty, which contains the central concept of a free and independent Japan. We feel that the allied matters I mentioned earlier arent insoluble if Japan is free, that they are insoluble if Japan isnt free. By signing this treaty we are enabling Japan to be in a position to do so, to enter into a treaty of friendship with the Government of China if she decides to recognize her, and I am happy to state, enabling her to enter into a treaty of peace and friendship with India. If we dont sign this treaty, none of these eventualities can take place.
We in Ceylon were fortunate that we werent invaded, but the damage caused by air raids, by the stationing of enormous armies under the South-East Asian Command, and by the slaughter-tapping of one of our main commodities, rubber, when we were the only producers of natural rubber for the Allies, entitle us to ask that the damage so caused should be repaired. We dont intend to do so, for we believe in the words of the Great Teacher whose message has ennobled the lives of countless millions in Asia, that hatred ceases not by hatred, but by love. It is the message of the Buddha, the Great Teacher, the Founder of Buddhism, which spread a wave of humanism through South Asia, Burma, Laos, Cambodia, Siam, Indonesia and Ceylon, and also northwards through the Himalayas into Tibet, China, and finally, Japan, which bound us together for hundreds of years with a common culture and heritage.
In Washington, John Foster Dulles told our Ambassador Sir Claude Corea, Your man was the hero of the conference. On San Francisco streets people saw banner headlines in the newspapers. There were several glowing tributes paid to him. .. 

JRJ had appeared on American television after the peace conference bringing good publicity for Ceylon. One reporter wrote, 
A darkly handsome diplomat from the seldom considered island of Ceylon spoke resoundingly for international decency and magnanimity to a world that has known little of it of late. He was Jayewardene, Finance Minister of the rubber rich island. Dispassionately and with logic he tore Russias wrecking crew to pieces in an address at the peace conference. He was able to convert Laos, Cambodia and Pakistan to support the treaty.
The wealthy Jayewardene familys prominence was at its peak during Dicks early days. His father and two of his fathers siblings were lawyers and young Dick was inspired and influenced by the oratorical skills of uncle Hector. The first seed of his curiosity in politics was sowed in him when uncle Hector won the New Bazaar Ward in the Colombo Municipal. 16-year-old JRJ made an entry in his dairy, Today I bought a Gillette razor, a practice he began in 1921 and continued throughout his life. These diaries preserved at the Presidential Archives at Breamar and JRJ Center provide a lot of insight into his thoughts.
A darkly handsome diplomat from the seldom considered island of Ceylon spoke resoundingly for international decency and magnanimity to a world that has known little of it of late. He was JRJ.
Dickie and brother Cobert were customary visitors at grandmother [maternal] Helena Wijewardenes mansion (present American Centre near Galle Face Hotel) where regular religious rituals took place. They were attracted to Buddhist practices. The lady was successful in winning them over to Buddhism. Father EW, the staunch Anglican, however, did not object. 
JRJs skill in expressing in coherent verbal form received acclaims: The San Francisco News, wrote, a dapper, diminutive Ceylonese with a David-like gift for throwing verbal stones stole the show at the plenary session. Mr. Jayewardene, Ceylons delegate won an applause from all, but the Soviet delegates. His vocabulary touched off a roar of acclamation that shook the windows of the opera house meeting room. Time: Ablest Asian spokesman at the conference was Ceylons delegate, JR Jayewardene, a slim, soft-spoken man with a razor-like tongue. New York Herald Tribune: Ceylons Jayewardene led the spokesman for 13 of the 52 nations at the conference in proclaiming their intention to sign the Anglo-American sponsored treaty. 
The President of US, made some characteristic remarks in his address; the treaty we are gathered here to sign has not been drawn in a spirit of revenge. The treaty reflects the spirit in which we carried on the war. The principles for which we fought were clearly set forth by president Roosevelt right after Pearl Harbour. ..we know that independent people have more vigour and staying power, and can do more to help secure peace, than people held under alien control Americans the prime movers of the conference were keen to get DS Senanayake the PM to lead the Ceylonese delegation. But PM had other ideas; he wanted to send JR instead and he presented a cabinet paper making a point that, Although over five years have lapsed since the surrender of Japan, a conclusion of a peace treaty has not been possible due to irreconcilable difference of opinion between Western alleys and Soviet Union -- JRJ Cent. MSS FILE NO 119
The PMs instructions to me were brief; We should ask for no reparations; and we should insist that Japan should recover her freedom. - Men and memories- Autobiographical Reflections by JRJ. 
In lighter vein
On one instance in early 1920s, in the Royal College boxing ring JRJ met his schoolmate Colvin R de Silva. It doesnt matter who won and who lost, but both of them were quick-witted mercilessly articulate orators, who ended in opposite corners in Sri Lankas political ring as giants for the rest of their lives. Junius Richard, who amazed the delegates in the afternoon, fascinated them with his scintillating melodious voice singing, O come all ye faithful joyful and triumphant... The combination created a sound that got impregnated in the memories of generations of Japanese people.

Abortion: Medical doctors brief religious leaders
	
A group of medical doctors representing the Health Ministry met with religious leaders of the the Congress of Religions at Sri Sambodhi Maha Viharaya in Colombo yesterday afternoon to explain and discuss about the proposed amendments to abortion laws.
Ven. Ittapana Dhammalankara Mahanayaka Thera, Prof. Ven. Bellanwila Wimalaratana Thera, Ven. Dr. Akuratiye Nanda Thera, Ven. Thiniyawala Palitha Thera, Archbishop of Colombo His Eminence Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith, Ash Sheikh Fazil Farook of All Ceylon Jamiyyathul Ulama (ACJU) and number of other religious leaders attended the meeting representing the Congress of Religions.
Prof. Sujeewa Amarasena, Professor in Paediatrics of the Ruhuna Universitys Medicine Faculty said the recommendations had been made to decriminalise abortion and allow for medical termination of pregnancies only in three specific circumstances under strict regulations.
The three instances are sexual abuse and incest, the pregnancy occurring in a girl below the age of 16 (a victim of statutory sexual assault) and serious foetal impairments when the fetus is 12-week old.
Even for these instances, a Magistrate will have the final say in the decision and the approval of a panel of three physicians including the Judicial Medical Officer and a psychiatrist should be sought in order to proceed. Abortion should only be performed by a state medical doctor at a government hospital. In case of a sexual abuse, a complaint should be lodged with the police informing the crime, he said.
In terms of foetal impairments, Prof. Amarasena said they have identified 30 instances including genetic mutations where the baby would have no chance of survival when born.
He said the recommendations to amend the existing laws pertaining to abortion, which were set by the Penal Code of 1883, were brought out of compassionate and it was only for those who in need of abortion.
These laws cannot be misused because of strict implementation and cannot be commercialized or promoted because the surgeries would be performed only at a government hospital, he said responding to the questions by the clergy.
He said about 600-1,000 illegal abortions are being performed daily in the country putting the lives of mothers at major risk.
By way of allowing abortion under certain circumstances, these numbers could likely to reduce. Positive results could be seen in the health sector of other countries, where abortion has been made legal under different circumstances. We cant guarantee that it would exactly be the same in Sri Lanka but mostly it could be a success, he said.
The doctors said the abortion laws were amended for the first time in India, a country with vast diversity of religious beliefs in 1971 while Nepal amended it in 2002.
They also emphasized on sexual abuse, the psychological trauma of the victim who becomes pregnant, incest and social issues arise from these incidents.
Raising their concerns, Ven. Bellanwila Wimalaratana Thera said according to teachings of Dhamma, foetus has life since the conception, and therefore, killing of a human life cannot be accepted.
We admit that there are issues faced by raped victims who become pregnant. They have to undergo many difficulties and sometimes the society treat them in a manner which is far worse than it treats the rapist. Therefore, the victims resort to illegal abortion. The laws which applies to Sangha is set by Vinaya. Vinaya says killing or aiding to kill a human, even a fetus, is a cause for Parajika (Expulsion from the Sangha). The medical doctors know what is best for the patient. According to common laws, abortion may not be a crime but it is so to us. For us what counts as a crime is the intention to end a life be it a mercy killing or abortion. This is a topic we should discuss further in detail, the prelate said.
His Eminence Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith said there are ample places and services in the country to accept children if a rape victim who becomes pregnant wishes not to raise the child.
There are instances where such victims even continue to raise the child. We cannot generalize few incidents. We should look at alternatives. We should focus on sex education. The society should be educated about the value of life. Terminating a life is a dreadful thing to do. We respect and accept the individual rights but within a religious framework we cannot approve this, the His Eminence said.
Meanwhile, Ash Sheikh Fazil Farook said Islamic teachings are too against abortion in general except for three circumstances.
A good family is a blessing, a gift of god. There is no choice to terminate a foetus except for three instances under strict supervision in Islam. An abortion can be performed when the mothers life is in danger, within 40 days if a girl was subject to sexual abuse and she did not want the baby and within 120 days if the foetus is diagnosed with extreme deformed conditions. However, laws pertaining to killing of a soul should be strong. If that law is not strong, people would abuse the abortion practice. Today, the Sri Lankas problem is how strong is the law with regard to value of a soul and how strongly it is being implemented, he said. .
Wrapping up the discussion, Ven. Ittapana Dhammalankara Thera expressed gratitude to the doctors for explaining about the proposed amendments though the religious leaders and the doctors have different opinions.
However, it was significant to note that the multiple party discussion on legalizing abortion under special circumstances was not attended by a single female representative. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Aloysius lied to COPE: Palisena
	
PTL CEO Kasun Palisena giving evidence before the PCoI today admitted that his boss Arjun Aloysius had lied to the Parliamentary watchdog committee COPE headed by MP Sunil Handunneththi, when he appeared before it during its inquiry into the Treasury Bond controversy.
During the cross-examination, Deputy Solicitor General Milinda Gunatilleke told PTL CEO Kasun Palisena that there was a limit to lying and therefore to reveal the truth before the Commission without carrying the load on behalf of Arjun Aloysius.
Justice Prasanna Jayawardena also told the witness to at least have the courtesy to come up with a lie that is believable.
Continuing the cross-examination of PTL CEO Kasun Palisena, DSG Gunatilleke yesterday questioned him again on the information which was passed by Aloysius regarding the precise cutoff rate at the March 29, 2016 auction.
It was earlier explained that Arjun Aloysius had conveyed to Palisena the cutoff rate at the auction would be around 14.80%.
The DSG showing some documents confirmed yesterday that the Public Debt Department of CBSL had recommended to accept all the bids below 14.7996% at the March 29 Auction.
The DSG showed that there were 200 bids at the auction and in the 131 place in the bid sheet was PTLs bid which was a Rs. 5 billion at a rate of precisely 14.7996%.
DSG Gunatilleke showed that the CBSL had subsequently accepted all bids which were below that rate (the PTL bid rate which was 14.7996%).Therefore PTLs bid of Rs. 5 billion at a rate of precisely 14.7996% was the last bid that was accepted. He said the rate quoted by PTL was precisely similar to the cutoff rate recommended by the PDD.
DSG Gunatilleke: What was the cutoff rate at the March 29, 2016 auction
Witness Palisena: 14.7996%
DSG: That is identical to the PDDs recommendation to the fourth decimal point, right
W: Yes
DSG: So, the person who fixed this rate at the PDD should have passed this information to Aloysius, isnt it
W: That I dont know
DSG: So, who would have provided this information to Aloysius
W: That I dont know
DSG: How would you not know about it According to the phone conversations, Aloysius had provided you the exact information about the cutoff rate
W: Yes, but Idont about it
DSG: Then, only Aloysius would know about it
W: That I dont know
It was revealed in one of the conversations between Palisena and Aloysius, PTL CEO Palisena asks Aloysius whether he was certain about the provided information on the cutoff rate. And Aloysius replies 100% sure.
DSG Gunatilleke noted that the average yield rate of PTLs bid at the auction was precisely around what Aloysius asked Palisena to bid at.
At this moment DSG Gunatilleke played another phone recording of a conversation between Aloysius and Palisena, in which Palisena tells Aloysius: I got Little Johnnys bids.
When questioned, Palisena said what was referred to as Little Johnny was about the bids of their clients as they were regarded as small bids. But the DSG was not convinced from that answer and showed some documents which reflect bids by clients of PTL in the auctions. Then witness Palisena said bids by their clients would not show in that document and it would show in PTLs bidding sheet.
DSG Gunatilleke was unhappy with the answer as there was no marked document perusable at that point from PTL before the Commission.
The DSG continued to question the witness on Little Johnny, but the witness was maintaining his stance. Then the DSG said: Tell the truth, was it correct to say that Dhanuka (SLIC dealer) was referred to as bee hive in the trading industry Witness answer was affirmative. And you were called as Mod Goviya, right witness confirmed yes.
DSG: So was this person referred to as Little Johnny, the DFCC dealer Kaveen Karunamurti, who was the intermediary when PTL sold bonds to NSB, SLIC and EPF in the secondary market
Witness Palisena rejected that and went on to maintain his earlier stance.
DSG Gunatilleka said PTL had also included dealers from state institutions like Naveen Anuradha (from NSB), Dhanuka (SLIC) and Saman Kumara (EPF) into the ring which allowed PTL to gain phenomenal profits.
The DSG showing PTLs capital gains documents explained that PTL had gained phenomenal profits of around Rs. 2 billion each in November 2015, April and May, 2016.
However, after the EPF stopped its secondary market transactions in May, 2016, PTLs profits significantly fell, as their June, July and August 2016 profits were around only 500 million, which was similar to other primary dealers.
The DSG was of the view that Aloysius had inside information about the Treasury Departments fund requirements which were confidential and information that other Primary Dealers were not privy to.
In the phone conversation, Aloysius also tells Palisena precisely about the Governments fund requirement as Rs.122 billion by the end of March, 2016.
After a series of questions by Justice Jayawardena, it was revealed that though Rs.105 billion of the Rs. 122 billion requirement of the Government was public knowledge, the rest of the Rs.17 billion was confidential information which was only known to CBSL and the General Treasury. 
At this moment, the DSG played another phone conversation, which reflects a discussion between two dealers of PTL about a cash check (Rs.1.1 million) to be sent to a person, known as Little Johnny. 
DSG: In the conversations they refer to a cash check to be sent to one Little Johnny, right
Witness Palisena initially disagreed to it and later the DSG played the conversation again and only thereafter he admitted to it as yes.
DSG: Who was this Little Johnny
W: Can be anyone.
The Court room burst out in laughter at the answer of Palisena.
DSG: There is a limit to lying.
Witness was silent
DSG: Ok that means you dont believe there is a limit, lets continue then.
Justice Jayawardena also seemed surprised after knowing that one of the parties to that conversation was one Gajan, because he was attending the proceedings and advising PTL lawyers in regular basis.
Oh is that Gajan, our friend who used to come here, Justice Jayawardane said in a sarcastic manner.
After a series of questions by Justice Jayawardane and the DSG, It was explained that this cash check of Rs. 1.1 million was sent to Perpetual Capital Holding (PCH) from PTL. It was revealed that PCH had no clients as Palisena earlier said in their business and it was a possible payment to its owner Aloysius, who might have wanted it to pay some one else referred as Little Johnny.
Justice Chitrasiri at this point also referring to some words in the phone conversations said: It says check eka eyata dunna (the check was given to an individual), so there is an individual. Who was he
W: it could be anyone, even an employee.
Justice Jayawardena: At least have the courtesy to tell a lie which is believable. The conversation tells about an individual. According to you it can be many Little Johnnys as well. So tell the truth now
Witness Palisena was avoiding the answer and maintained that it could be anyone and many Little Johnnys.
Justice Jayawardane: If frankly said, at least come up with a lie that is believable. 
DSG Gunatilleka: You are carrying a heavy load on behalf of Arjun Aloysius.
Witness was silent for a while and rejected what they said. 
Referring to the capital gains which were transferred from PTL to other companies in the Perpetual Group, Justice Jayawardane asked the witness whether these capital gains were also used to pay regularly a fairly large sum of money to so called Little Johnnies.
The witness disagreed with the profit transfers and said again that Little Johnnies could be anyone, even an employee of the company.
In a telephone conversation played before the Commission it was earlier revealed that Palisena had asked his close friend Kaveen Karunamurti ( dealer DFCC), to give the number of transactions that he had been involved in with PTL and other government institution to the PTL finance department. In that conversation Palisena tells this is something for you.
DSG Gunatilleke also playing another phone recording contested the witness earlier argument that PTL had bid in the March 2016 auctions based on its Financial analyst, Gajans predictions.
In another phone conversation it was revealed that Gajan was telling one dealer that he is trying to prepare a report to show a prediction that corresponds to what happened in the March auctions. This conversation happens in the afternoon of March 29,2016, after the auction took place.
Earlier PTL produced prediction reports of their analyst that were said to have been prepared prior to the auction.
When the DSG questioned about this from witness Palisena, he said the conversation was about some daily reports. (the court room burst out in laughter)
Then referring to some words reflected in the conversation, DSG Gunetilleke said: This witness is an unrepentant liar and he is doing this because of the nine digit bonus he is getting. (a figure that is over Rs.100 million)
The witness rejected it.
You are not accepting what everybody understands, because you are well looked after, DSG Gunatilleke said.
DSG Gunatilleke again played another phone conversation which happened between a dealer of PTL and a financial officer at W.M. Mendis & Co.
Boss ge (Aloysius) payment ekak neda (is this a boss payment), one says. Melo deyak Api dan ne illanakota denawa (We dont know anything. We give when asked)
The DSG was of the view that even the employees were in a confusion about these inter company payments, which ultimately ended up in Aloysius pocket.
Thereafter, referring to the Sunil Hadunnettis COPE report, DSG Gunatilleke made the witness to read what Arjun Aloysius had told before the COPE committee in the latter part of 2016 when PTL was under investigation.
Aloysius had guaranteed to COPE that he had resigned from the position as the CEO of PTL in January 2015, after his father-in-law was appointed as the Governor of the CBSL considering the element of conflict of interest that could arise. He had said that thereafter he had never engaged in the operational activities in the company (PTL).
However, it was revealed earlier during PCoI proceedings, through phone conversations between Palisena and Aloysius, that Aloysius had been involved in operational activities of the PTL by instructing its CEO Palisena on bids and passing on price sensitive inside information which he had received from some sources referred to as our friends in department and our friends in powerful places.
In this backdrop, DSG Gunatillke and Justice Jayawardena repeatedly questioned Palisena to confirm that Arjun Aloysius was actually involved in operational activities regularly as opposed to what he told the COPE.
DSG: So, that means Arjun Aloysius had lied to the COPE, because there is evidence in this commission that he had been involved in PTL operations
Witness was avoiding the answer.
Justice Chitrasiri: Now we saw from those phone conversations that those bids were placed by you under Aloysius instructions, so, under these circumstances was Aloysius statement to the COPE true or not
W: Yes he got involved in operational activities of PTL
DSG: Dont go around give a straight answer. 
Justice Jayawardena: Aloysius had lied to the COPE. Correct or wrong I want an answer.
Witness finally admitted: He has lied.

Asgiriya Chapter condemns insults made on Buddhist clergy
	
Asgiriya Maha Vihara Chapter Registrar Ven. Medagama Dhammananda Thera making a special statement yesterday, regarding the insults made on Buddhist monks by certain politicians, expressed concern and condemned the act.
The Thera said: "At a time like this when President Maithripala Sirisena has taken a timely action to introduce an insurance cover for the old Buddhist monks , there are various government ministers and parliamentarians who have made insulting remarks by levelling allegations in various forms. It has to be treated as a downright insult.
There are politicians who have been rejected by the people and become popular in various fields. They act without any good feeling towards the country and without an understanding about the values, religious and cultural background and whims and fancies of the general public,the Thera said.
The Thera said political party leaders should select candidates wisely and intelligently at the forthcoming elections without giving permission to candidates who are involved in unbecoming acts. (J.A.L. Jayasinghe)

At least 50 people dead and 80 injured in southern Iraq
	

DAILY MAIL, 14 September, 2017 
More than 50 people have been killed and at least 80 wounded in a double suicide bomb attack in southern Iraq, allegedly carried out by Islamic State militants. 
ISIS-linked terrorists attacked a restaurant and a police checkpoint on a highway near the city of Nassiriya, Dhi Qar province, police and medical sources said. 
One attacker detonated his explosive vest inside the restaurant south-west of the city, while three to four other attackers opened fire at the people inside.This attack was followed by two suicide bombers, including one driving an explosives-laden car, at the police checkpoint nearby. 
Yahya al-Nassiri, the governor of Dhi Qar, says the majority of the dead are expected to be Iranian pilgrims who were inside the restaurant. 
Dhi Qar is dominated by Shia Muslims, a group that ISIS - who are Sunni Muslim - deem apostates, or heretics. 
Police said the death toll could rise as several of the wounded were in a critical condition.  Shiite Muslim-dominate Dhi Qar province is located about 200 miles southeast of Baghdad.  Bomb attacks in southern Iraq, where the bulk of the countrys oil is produced, are relatively rare.

British journalist killed by crocodile during holiday in SL
	
A Financial Times journalist has died after he was dragged underwater by a crocodile while on holiday in Sri Lanka, foreign media reported.
Paul McClean, 25, has been identified as the British man killed by the animal in a lagoon known as Crocodile Rock.
Meanwhile, Sri Lankan police said in a statement that a British national, who went to bathe in the sea at Panama with a group of friends, had gone missing and the police and the navy were searching for the missing person.
According to the Telegraph, it is believed that Mr McClean left his friends to go to the toilet, and the beast ambushed him when he dipped his hands into the water to wash them.
One of his colleagues at the FT told the Telegraph: Were all totally stunned. He was a great kid, an Everton fan, super bright. Its an absolute tragedy.
Mr McClean grew up in Thames Ditton, Surrey, and graduated from Oxford University with a First in French in 2015.
Witnesses of the incident reportedly saw him waving his hands in the air in desperation before he was pulled below the surface by the crocodile.
It is believed he only arrived in the country a few days before.
A Scot who is on holiday in the area but wished to remain anonymous said: People last saw his arms in the air in the water and then was grabbed under. I was there but didnt see it happen though. Horrible.

JO to object passage of ICPAPED Bill
	
The Joint Opposition yesterday said that they would not let the government to pass the Bill on the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearances (ICPAPED) which would be debated in parliament on September 21.
JO member Prof. G.L. Peiris told a news conference that the debate on the ICPAPED was earlier postponed due to JO's opposition as well as of the public outcry.
The government is attempting to ratify the ICPAPED as soon as possible and its background has now been created with the approval of the Office of Missing Persons (OMP) Act, he added.
He also said that under the OMP Act, its officials were empowered to investigate any place and inquire any person anywhere and added that they had the sole authority to take any document to their custody.
He said that accordingly the people were abided by the Act to answer them and otherwise legal actions could be taken against them by considering it as a contempt of court.
The legal protection given to the people by the law governing in the country will be nullified as a result of this Act, he added.
Prof. Peiris said that President Maithripala Sirisena had delayed approving this Act for the past seven months, and however, he had recently approved it due to claims made by the UN representatives' condemning the court procedure in Sri Lanka.
Former Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe has opposed to these claims once he was the subject minister. However, similarly the ICPAPED will also be tabled in Parliament as a result of the pressure by foreign forces, he added. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)

## Title: Lactose Intolerance:  Is there a way out 
## Section: Medicine

Lactose Intolerance:  Is there a way out 
	
There is an enzyme that is called lactase that acts for the break down and digestion of lactose
	As we grow older we become more lactose intolerant because we produce less of the enzyme
	Symptoms include, cramping, vomiting, bloating, gas etc

Have you ever wondered why you get cramps or gassy after drinking a cup of milk or eating yoghurt It isnt because you are allergic to milk or dairy as a whole, but because as you grow older you become more lactose intolerant. Lactose intolerance is a condition that everyone is liable to experience. As it is quite manageable through a change in diet, the condition isnt considered to be serious. Speaking to Professor Arjuna de Silva, Professor in Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Ragama the Health Capsule learned a great deal about lactose intolerance and how it occurs. 
Definition
Lactose is a sugar found in milk and other dairy products such as yoghurt. According to Professor de Silva there is an enzyme that is called lactase, produced in the small intestine, that acts for the break down and digestion of lactose. Lactose intolerance happens when the body cant easily digest lactose. All children are born with the enzyme lactase. However, in some cases, it can be completely absent. As we grow older we become more lactose intolerant because we produce less of the enzyme. This is a very common phenomenon. It is very rare to see a child born completely deficient of the enzyme. It isnt a very serious condition and is quite easily manageable with changes to ones diet, Prof. de Silva explained. He added that Lactose intolerance is very common among Asians rather than Caucasians. According to him, people in countries that are close to the equator are more lactose intolerant than those further away.
Intolerance
Prof. de Silva went on to explain why we become more lactose intolerant as we age. It is because we are continually evolving. Normally only children are supposed to drink milk. We are the only mammals who drink milk as adults. Which is why our bodies are supposed to produce less of it as we age. Thus, older people who are fond of milk and dairy products will experience lactose intolerance. Lactose intolerance can even be genetic, he said.
He further stated, In some people the deficiency is more prominent than in others. Very rarely is it congenital. Those who experience the deficiency prominently usually wont be able to tolerate milk at all. Others can eat or drink small amounts of milk or dairy products without a problem. Sometimes people might even experience irritable bowel, but that isnt always due to lactose intolerance, he said.
Speaking of the difference between a milk allergy and lactose intolerance, Prof. de Silva stated that the mechanisms for the two are very different as lactose intolerance deals with the deficiency of the enzyme. 
Symptoms and diagnosis
Speaking about the symptoms Professor. de Silva said,  When your body cant break down lactose then the bacteria in the blood starts to break it down, which is when you experience various symptoms. Symptoms include, cramping, vomiting, bloating, gas etc. 
Diagnosis is generally clinical. You can go to a doctor and describe your symptoms and he or she may ask you to avoid dairy products for a short period of time to see if it is the cause for the symptoms. Otherwise it can be diagnosed through tests such as the lactose breath test, he said.


Treatment
Prof. de Silva further stated that there is no cure for lactose intolerance, but people can treat the symptoms. This can be done by limiting or avoiding milk products or even switching to substitutes. People who experience this condition prominently have to make dietary changes. Such people will have to reduce the amount of yoghurt, milk or any dairy products they consume. They will have to move to alternatives such as soy milk and almond milk or any other non dairy substitute,said Prof. De Silva.
Another problem that occurs is that when one removes milk products from the diet they are also removing a large source of calcium. Substitute food sources that are rich in calcium are things like kathurumurunga, sprats, small fish etc. These people can even get their calcium through calcium tablets. People who generally need a sufficient amount of calcium in their diet are pregnant women, women who are breastfeeding and post menopausal females, he further said. 
One of the biggest challenges people who are lactose intolerant face is changing their dietary habits and learning how to select meals that dont put them in discomfort.

Lalith, Anusha only implemented Presidents instructions: MR
	
Former president Mahinda Rajapaksa yesterday said that former presidents secretary Lalith Weeratunga and former TRC Director Anusha Pelpita had only carried out legitimate instructions issued to them by the President of the country.
Issuing a statement, he said The judgement itself states that neither Lalith Weeratunga nor Anusha Pelpita had appropriated for their personal use any of the money used to purchase sil redi. From my point of view, they only carried out legitimate instructions issued to them by the President of the country. The verbal instructions given by me in this regard have been recorded in the form of minutes placed by Mr Weeratunga on correspondence with officials of the Presidential Secretariat,
The full statement is as follows: 
The former Secretary to the President Lalith Weeratunga and the former Director General of the Telecommunications Regulatory Commission (TRC) Anusha Pelpita were declared guilty by the High Court under Section 386 of the Penal Code of dishonestly misappropriating a sum of Rs. 600 million belonging to the TRC by remitting the said sum to a bank account of the Presidential Secretariat to be used for the purpose of distributing sil redi during the last Presidential elections. They have each been sentenced to three years rigorous imprisonment, a fine of Rs. two million and either the payment of Rs 50 million in compensation to the TRC or a further two years of rigorous imprisonment. Many people including the media have asked me about this matter and I feel I should make my views known to the public.
To say that this conviction and sentence has shocked the country would be an understatement. The judgement itself states that neither Lalith Weeratunga nor Anusha Pelpita had appropriated for their personal use any of the money used to purchase sil redi. From my point of view, they only carried out legitimate instructions issued to them by the President of the country. The verbal instructions given by me in this regard have been recorded in the form of minutes placed by Mr Weeratunga on correspondence with officials of the Presidential Secretariat. On 20 March 2014, Mr Weeratunga wrote a minute to the Senior Assistant Secretary of the Presidential Secretariat outlining eight projects that I had ordered funded through the Presidents Special Development Fund during the year 2014.
The sixth item on this list was providing material aid to the devotees observing sil at temples on Poya days. The other projects on the list included funding for the IT section of the Kotelawala Defence University and assistance to construct houses for low income earners in the former border villages etc. On 12 May 2014, in yet another minute to the Senior Assistant Secretary Mr Weeratunga had stated that I had given instructions that sil redi be distributed to devotees observing sil on Poya days. This was long before the declaration of the presidential election. The purpose of the Presidents Special Development Fund which had an annual budget of Rs. 1,000 million and was started in 2012, was to fill the gaps left by other ministries and to meet requests made directly to the President.The Coordinating Secretary for Religious Affairs of the Presidential SecretariatVen. Watinapaha Somananda Thera was in charge of implementing the sil redi project.
At the latters request, the Economic Affairs Ministry carried out a survey through Samurdhi Niladharis to identify the requirements of sil redi at temples countrywide. The suppliers were instructed to hand over the sil redi to a main temple in each Divisional Secretariat area from where they would be distributed to other temples. This was a project implemented countrywide, involving 11,021 temples. This was aid supplied to the temples, not to voters. After the sil redi reached the temples, the Chief Incumbent monk became the sole authority who could decide when, how, and to whom the sil redi would be distributed. No time frame was imposed on the temples to carry out the distribution. They could have been distributed either immediately or even a year later at the discretion of the Chief Incumbent of the temple.
The mode of distribution did not enable the beneficiaries to be selected on political grounds. School uniforms are also distributed towards the end of the year and cannot be withheld even if an election was on. Nobody would suggest that the receipt of school uniforms during an election would influence the result of the election. The sil redi was also general state aid distributed across the board to Buddhist devotees just like the school uniforms. In fact the suppliers of school uniforms to the government had been mobilised for the sil redi project as well. The sil redi was not meant just for adults of voting age but for daham pasal students observing sil on Poya days as well. It was stated in the judgement that the sil redi parcels contained a label which read Mahinda Rajapaksa methithuman Mahinda Chinthana prathipaththi walata anuwa yamin karana daham pandurak. (A religious offering made by Mahinda Rajapaksa in pursuance of Mahinda Chintanaya policies.)
This was only a label stating the provenance of the sil redi, and in any event, is not in violation of Sections 72 and 68(1)(e) of the Presidential Elections Act No:15 of 1981, which deal with the display of printed matter during elections. Section 77 of the Presidential Elections Act on treating voters, also does not apply to this case because the sil redi was handed over to temples without any time frame for distribution and were provided to all regardless of the political affiliation of the temples and the devotees. Lalith Weeratunga and Anusha Pelpita were never charged for election related offences even though this is being portrayed as a case relating to the misuse of public property during election time. Under Section 164(4) of the Criminal Procedure Code, the charges brought against the accused have to clearly state the law under which the offence said to have been committed, is punishable.
The reason why money had to be obtained for this project from the TRC is because on 14 October 2014, the Chief Accountant of the Presidential Secretariat sent Lalith Weeratunga a note stating that the allocation of the Presidents Special Development Fund for the year 2014 was Rs. 1,000 million and that Rs. 400 million of this had to be given to a project of the Kotelawala Defence University and that there was insufficient funds for the sil redi project. Lalith Weeratunga replied to this with a minute on 15 October 2014 instructing the Chief Accountant to release the money to the Kotelawala Defence University and that the money for the sil redi project will be obtained from the TRC to be reimbursed later. Mr Weeratunga had written to the Director General of the TRC on 30 October 2014, stating that it had been decided to obtain financial patronage (mulya anugrahaya) for this project from the TRC.
Thereupon, Anusha Pelpita Director General of the TRC had prepared a board paper for this purpose on the same day seeking the approval of the board, (a) to allocate Rs. 600 million to the Corporate Social Responsibility budget of the TRC as an extra budgetary allocation, (b) to approve the donation of Rs. 600 million to the Presidents Special Development Fund and (c) to spend this amount from the corporate social responsibility budget of the TRC. This paper had been presented to the TRC board meeting held on 15 December 2014 and all three proposals had been unanimously approved by the Commission. The money from the TRC had been remitted to the Presidential Secretariat account on 5 December 2014.On 29 December 2014, Lalith Weeratunga sent a note to the Chief Accountant stating that the money from the TRC should be reimbursed as soon as the allocation for 2015 is received and that at least Rs. 200 million should be paid back in the first quarter of 2015.
According to Section 22F(3) of theSri Lanka Telecommunications Act No: 25 of 1991 as amended by Act No: 27 of 1996, the board of directors of the TRC can authorise any paymentin the performance of its tasks. Sections 218, 115, 65, 66, 68, 93 and 94 of the Financial Regulations of the Government of Sri Lanka also authorises Chief Accounting Officers (who in the case of the Presidential Secretariat was Lalith Weeratunga) to transfer money between government agencies under his authority on the basis of reimbursement. Regrettably, the written evidence presented to courts in the form of Lalith Weeratungas minutes giving instructions to the Chief Accountant or the Senior Assistant Secretary of the Presidential Secretariat in relation to this project have not been considered in the judgement delivered by the High Court.
The prosecution brought 21 witnesses to prove their case against the accused. The High Court has not taken into account the evidence provided by prosecution witness No: 13 Hewage Emali Priyanthara, No: 20 Ruwani Saumya Gunaratne, No: 15 Rev. Watinapaha Somananda Thero, No: 04 Saputhanthrige Chandra Jagath, No: 14 Mallika Kanakanamlage Jayantha and prosecution witness No: 5 Amarasinghe Lekamge Don Gunaratne (the Chief Accountant of the Presidential Secretariat) on the grounds that they had worked with the accused in the Presidential Secretariat and the TRC and were also connected to the sil redi project and that they had been partial (lediyawak) or sympathetic to the accused. These were witnesses called by the prosecution - not the defence - and their evidence had been provided to courts under oath.
This has very serious implications for state employees at all levels. If for example an employee of the Customs Department is taken to courts for allegedly violating procedure, the only way to prove or disprove that such a violation took place is through written and verbal evidence from within the Customs Department itself. If in such cases, even the testimony of witnesses brought by the prosecution is not taken into account on the grounds that they had worked with the accused and were therefore partial, the accused government servant will have no defence at all.Another matter of grave concern in the case of Lalith Weeratunga, is that the handwritten instructions given by the highest State official in the land to his subordinates have not been considered by the courts.
If this becomes a precedent, no State employee charged in a court of law will ever be able to prove his innocence. The unanimous approval of Anusha Pelpitas board paper by the TRC board of directors on 15 December 2014 has also not been taken into accountin a situation where the authority with exclusive power to utilise the funds of the TRC is the TRC board of directors. This will have serious implications for all private sector and state sector bodies that are run by boards of directors. The severe sentence imposed on Lalith Weeratunga and Anusha Pelpita is not because they enriched themselves through corrupt means but because they carried out the instructions of the head of state to distribute sil redi to temples in pursuance of the governments obligations under Article 9 of the Constitution to foster and protect Buddhism.
Under our constitution, the direction and control of the government is the responsibility of the cabinet of ministers (including the President) and the public service is expected to work in good faith to achieve the policy objectives of the government. Therefore public servants who carry out lawful instructions issued to them by the President and the Cabinet should be protected if there are no serious allegations of corruption against them.

Myth Buster
	
MYTH: Eating fish while pregnant can make your baby intelligent. 
BUSTED: There is such a belief that exists. And it has been proved that the fish can improve the brain development of the child in the womb. Eating small fish is recommended. There are some amino acids that are present which contribute to brain development.
But you have to be careful with the type of fish you get. There are some fish with a high content of heavy metals, such as mercury. A good example for this is deep sea fish. But in Sri Lanka it isnt very common, said Dr. U.D.P Rathnasiri, Consultant Obstetrician/ Gynaecologist, Castle Street Hospital.

No intention of entering politics: Chathurika
	
President Maithripala Sirisena's daughter Chaturika, said at today's launch of the book authored by her and titled, "Janadhipathi Thaththa", that she had no intention of entering party politics but would use politics for community service, women empowerment and social justice.
So many people, including my friends keep asking me when I enter politics. I am reminded of what Aristotle said that man is either a political animal or an outcast. Though I agree with him, I have no desire to indulge in politics but to engage in social welfare, she said at the ceremony held at the BMICH at the launch of the book which describes her father's political journey.
Ms. Sirisena said from early childhood she realised that her family was different from other families in the village. She said, she, her sister and brother were inquisitive and witnessed the numerous meetings held at their home with people walking in and out most of the day.
"When my father was engaged in grassroots level politics, people used to ask him why he was still in local politics and why he did not enter Parliament. During the civil war, many of my friends came to school directly from nearby forests where they slept overnight for fear of being attacked by the LTTE. When my mother brought my lunch to school I offered it to other students who did not have any food for breakfast. My father has escaped unhurt from five attempts on his life by the LTTE probably because he was destined to lead this country to a new era and give our people new hope and freedom. However, we lived in constant fear of terrorist attacks and my mother was in the habit of not having her lunch or dinner until my father returned home," she said.
Ms. Sirisena said her friend Dulanjalee, former President Ranasinghe Premadasas daughter, continued to tell me during the presidential election campaign to keep an eye on her (Chathurika's) father because there were attempts to poison President Premadasa when he was alive.
"Dulanjalee specifically told me to inspect vegetables and fruits supplied to my house before letting my father eat them. As politicians' children of politicians we have suffered beyond limit.
My father never mixes his personal life with politics and never talks politics at home. But as a family we were ready to face any challenge based on his political decisions whether good or bad. When my father decided to contest the 2015 presidential election as the common candidate the entire family was behind him and we did our utmost to protect him until he took oaths as Sri Lanka's new President," Ms. Sirisena said.
She requested academics, writers and the media to review her book and pinpoint shortcomings and mistakes if any so that she could correct them in future editions.
The first copy of the book was presented by the author Chaturika Sirisena to her father President Sirisena and her mother Jayanthi Sirisena. She also presented copies of the book to Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, Sunethra Bandaranaike and Dulanjalee. (Sandun A Jayasekera)

North Korea launches missile over Japan
	
North Korea fired a ballistic missile over the northern Japanese island of Hokkaido today in a major show of defiance to the international community, the CNN reported today.
The launch is the second to fly over Japan in less than a month, and the first since North Korea's sixth nuclear test and new United Nations sanctions on the country.
Friday's missile test follows the release of a statement Wednesday, in which the North Korean state news agency KCNA threatened the "four islands of the (Japanese) archipelago should be sunken into the sea by the nuclear bomb of Juche," referring to the ruling ideology of North Korea.
Speaking to reporters Friday, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said the launch was "totally unacceptable" and went against "the international community's strong, united will for a peaceful solution."
North Korea's latest missile was fired from the district of Sunan in the North Korean capital of Pyongyang, home to the country's main airport, the South Korean military said.
The missile flew about 3,700 kilometers (2,300 miles) and reached an altitude of 770 kilometers (480) miles before landing in the Pacific Ocean.
Initial US assessments suggested North Korea had fired an intermediate-range ballistic missile, similar to that fired over Japan last month.
In response to North Korea's launch, South Korea carried out a "live fire drill" that included a missile launch which the South Korean Joint Chiefs of Staff said was capable of striking the Sunan airport launch site near Pyongyang used for today's launch.
The South Korean missile, which was launched from the country's east coast while the North Korean missile was still in the air, was "a show of force in response to North Korea's latest provocation," a South Korean official has told CNN.
A second missile that was fired at the same time failed and "sank into the sea off the east coast," an official said.
Park Soo-hyun, spokesman for South Korean President Moon Jae-in, said the country's military had been ordered "to prepare a stern measure that can effectively counter North Korea's increasing nuclear and military threats."
Friday's missile test set off sirens as a government warning, known as the J-Alert, went out to citizens across a broad swath of northern Japan.
"The government is advising people to stay away from anything that could be missile debris," CNN said quoting NHK.
