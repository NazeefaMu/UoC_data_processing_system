A budget of consolidation: SLFP
	
SLFP Minister Susil Premajayantha said more funds have been allocated to improve innovation and enterprises in the budget.
He said the only way to bridge the budget deficit within the next three years was to attract investment and improve exports.
?There are some policy decisions proposed by the Ministry of Finance. I am happy about that. You cannot expect too much relief at this stage. The finance minister is managing the budget with great difficulty by imposing a super luxury tax for vehicles and taxing the rich without passing the burden to middle income earners and the poor.?

A budget that promotes entrepreneurship: SLMC
	
Sri Lanka Muslim Congress (SLMC) Leader Minister Rauff Hakeem said this budget was a progressive one with a new approach.
He said it was a budget aimed at preserving the environment and preventing natural disasters as well as promoting entrepreneurship among the people.
?It looks at areas where investments have to be made to attract tourism and to increase the country?s revenue. A variety of proposals have been put forward without burdening the people. This budget will give the less privileged sections of our society to get access to proper housing and help them with their livelihoods by giving them some concessionary capital infusion to fulfil their ideas and projects,? he said and added that the budget has taken a holistic view of what needs to be achieved.

A budget which saves money for essential services: UNP
	
UNP Minister Eran Wickramaratne said the Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera had done a tremendous job by securing macroeconomic fundamentals and raising revenue so that more funds could be made available for essential services such as education, health and social transfers.
He said the finance minister had also managed to keep the budget deficit low, adding that 2018 would be a challenging year because the country would have to repay the highest debt in history.
?This budget has emphasized on building human capital rather than on hard infrastructure. That is a right decision because spending on human capital will help Sri Lanka to have a unique touch over the countries in the region. We won?t be exporting cheap labour any more as more funds have been allocated to develop universities and vocational training centres in the country,? he said. (Ajith Siriwardana and Yohan Perera)

Another example of failed economic path since '77: JVP
	
Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake said the budget was yet another example of the failed economic path the government had taken since 1977.
?Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera said in his budget speech that his objective was to continue the economic policy of 1977. His policy is dependant on foreign investments and foreign markets instead of trying to make our economy self-sufficient. He is trying to rely on the failed open economic model again,? he said.
He said the country would fall into more debt next year as Rs.1, 895 billion was now needed to bridge the current budget deficit.
When asked if they saw nothing positive in the budget he said there were some improvements in certain sectors but the budget should be looked at as a whole, not separately. (Ajith Siriwardana and Yohan Perera)

## Title: Bronchitis and Asthma  How can  I know what  exactly   my problem is?
## Section: Medicine

Bronchitis and Asthma  How can  I know what  exactly   my problem is?
	
?
Bronchitis and Asthma are two common medical conditions related to our respiratory system and as most people find them quite confusing, today we thought of discussing those separately to give you a clear understanding on which is which.
?
What is Bronchitis?
?
Bronchitis is defined as an inflammation of the bronchial tube linings, which carry air from the atmosphere into and out of the lungs.? ?
?
This can either occur as an acute or chronic condition depending on the time period of the signs and symptoms. Acute bronchitis will last for a few days. Patients recover without any residual effects, whereas repeated bouts of bronchitis can be referred to as Chronic bronchitis, which is one of the serious conditions associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). This usually occurs due to a constant irritation or inflammation of the bronchial tube linings, mostly due to long term smoking. Chronic bronchitis is usually defined as a productive cough which lasts for at least 3 months, with repeated episodes for at least 2 consecutive years.? ?
?
The major etiology for acute bronchitis includes viruses such as respiratory infections caused by Influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) where chronic bronchitis is caused by long term exposure to cigarette smoke. In some individuals, who are exposed to polluted air, dust, fumes and toxic gases in a chronic manner can later develop this condition which might give rise to severe complications like COPD.? ?
?
?
Commonest risk factors
?
Cigarette smoking? ?
?
Weak immunity and poor resistance to infections- HIV/AIDS, Diabetes Mellitus, chronic illnesses, extremities of age? ?
?
?Chronic exposure to irritants like fumes, dust, chemicals, hair spray- Especially at the work place? ?
	Gastric reflux-Repeated episodes of severe heartburn due gastro esophageal reflux disease can irritate the mucosa on throat, making it more vulnerable for an inflammation to occur.? ?
?
Symptoms of Bronchitis
?
A productive cough with clear, white, yellowish-gray or green sputum which might or might not bemixed with blood? ?
	Fatigue and weakness?
	Shortness of breath? ?
	Mild fever with chills? ?
	Chest pain or heaviness? These symptoms can sometimes resolve spontaneously without the need of any medication, but it is important to seek medical advice,? ??
	If the features last for more than three weeks? ?
	Result in sleep disturbances? ?
	Fever higher than 100.4 F (38 C)? ?
	Accompanied by discoloured phlegm? ?
	Hemoptysis (coughing out blood)? ?
	Wheezing? ?
	Shortness of breath?
?
Individuals with chronic bronchitis will sometimes need pulmonary rehabilitation to reduce the susceptibility to further infections and inflammation
?
?
?
Diagnosis
?
An early diagnosis of Bronchitis, will prevent most of the life threatening complications. Therefore there are some mandatory investigations which should be carried out in suspected patients to confirm the diagnosis and find the etiology.
? ?
Chest X-ray- Especially to exclude other conditions like Pneumonia which can cause similar symptoms and signs? ?
	Sputum tests- To exclude whooping cough (pertussis) and allergies? ?
	Pulmonary function test- To assess the function of respiratory system which will help in excluding? Asthma or emphysema? ?Acute bronchitis will usually resolve within 1-2 weeks even without medication, but some physicians will prescribe Antibiotics, Cough suppressants and anti-inflammatory agents to keep the?air-ways open.? ?
?
Individuals with chronic bronchitis will sometimes need pulmonary rehabilitation to reduce the susceptibility to further infections and inflammation. It will also help to ease breathing and maintain a proper functioning of the lungs.? ?
?
?
Is this similar to Asthma?
?
Well, Asthma is defined as a chronic lung disease which causes inflammation thereby narrowing the airways, resulting in recurrent episodes of wheezing, chest tightness, sleep disturbances, shortness of breath and coughing (often occurs at night or early in the morning).
?
?It can affect individuals of any age, but many identified cases have found to be initiated during childhood.? ?Asthma, isn?t a condition which can be cured completely, but effectively managed symptomatically with proper and timely medication.? ?
?
As far as the etiology is concerned, exposure to different irritants can easily trigger an inflammation of the airways which will release the chemical known as Histamine, resulting in bronchoconstriction and vasodilatation.? ?
?
?
Commonest irritants to exacerbate Asthma
?
Pollen grains, dust mites, spores, pet dander, cockroach waste? ?
	Respiratory infections (common cold, flu)? ?
	Strenuous physical activities (exercise-induced asthma)? ?
	Cold air and humidity? ?
	B blockers, aspirin, ibuprofen and Naproxen? ?
	Emotional disturbances (stress)? ?
	Certain foods and beverages (shrimp, tomatoes, potatoes, beer, wine)?
	Gastro esophageal reflux disease (GERD)? ?
?
Other risk factors
?
Positive family history, history of atopic dermatitis or allergic rhinitis, obesity, tobacco smoke, second hand smoking? ?
?
Diagnosis of asthma?
?
Your doctor will take measures to identify the triggering factors and exclude conditions which can produce similar signs and symptoms. Mandatory investigations in a clinically suspected individual include,? ?
?
Assessment of the lung function? ?
	Spirometry and peak-flowmetry- to assess the severity of airway narrowing? ?
	Methacholine challenge- A positive response to this chemical which is a known asthma trigger will confirm Asthma.? ?
	Chest X-ray? ?
	Sputum Eosinophil analysis? ?
?
Treatment for Asthma depends on how severe the condition is and how it interferes with one?s day today activities
?
Mild intermittent- Mild symptoms at least 2 days/week and 2 nights/month? ?
	Mild persistent-Symptoms more than twice a week, but no more than once during a single day?
	Moderate persistent-Symptoms once/day and more than one night/week? ?
	Severe persistent-Symptoms throughout the day on most days and frequently?at night? ?
?
Medication
?
Preventive- (inhaled corticosteroids, leukotriene modifiers, long acting B agonists) which provide a long-term relief on reducing the inflammation of airways and? ?
	Quick-relief inhalers (bronchodilators-short acting B agonists, Ipratropium) which provide an immediate action causing a widening and opening up the airways.? ?
?
In a nutshell
?
	Both Bronchitis and Asthma are inflammatory conditions of the lower respiratory tract, which could possibly result in a difficulty in breathing.? ?
	?
	Definition- Asthma is a chronic condition characterized by recurrent bouts of airway narrowing whereas Bronchitis is a short-term or acute illness, usually lasting 1-few weeks (in a long term basis).? ?
	Individuals with asthma will often complain of a chest tightness, shortness of breath and wheezing whereas acute bronchitis will present with a hacking cough, with or without phlegm and Chronic bronchitis with a persistent cough and wheezing.? ?

Budget panders to IMF whims and fancies: JO
	
Joint Opposition (JO) MP Bandula Gunawardene said the budget was sure to fail as in it the government was trying to increase foreign investments by relaxing laws for foreigners and imposing excessive taxes on the people.
?This is a more liberal budget which would not offer any benefits to the people,? he said.
He said the finance minister could not present a budget beyond the conditions laid down by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for a loan negotiated by former finance minister Ravi Karunanayake.
?According to the agreement it is the IMF which decides the expenditure of the country for the next three years. The finance minister cannot present a budget beyond the policy framework given by the IMF,? he said. (Ajith Siriwardana and Yohan Perera)

Concerns raised over banning Lanka e News
	
Several international and local media movements had condemned the government?s decision to ban the news portal Lanka e News (LeN) stating the action a threat to sustaining media freedom.
In a letter sent to President Maithripala Sirisena, the Young Journalists' Association (YJA) had raised concerns about the blockage of the news portal Lanka e News (LeN) due to its critical reporting.
YJA President Tharindu Uduwaragedara stated that during the time of the past regime LeN was once set on fire, restricting access and a court case was against three of its journalists.
Uduwaragedara said that to date justice had not been served with regards to these atrocities.
Therefore, he had requested the President to remove the ban on the LeN immediately and to appoint a committee to probe the incidents of suppression carried out against journalists in this country.
In another development in a tweet the Committee to Protect Journalists-Asia (CPJ Asia) had also condemned the action by the Telecommunication Regulatory Commission (TRC) to impose a ban on LeN. ?CPJ is concerned about reports that the news site Lanka E News has been blocked in Sri Lanka because of its critical reporting. This is a violation of press freedom and access to the website should be restored immediately,? it said in its twitter account.
Meanwhile, tweeting over the matter the Free Media Movement (FMM) had urged the Government to stop practising informal censorship by obstructing technical access to Lanka E-news Website.
In a statement, the Ceylon Teachers? Association (CTU) had strongly condemned the ban imposed on LeN and said it was clear that the action was a result of it criticising the government.
It also said banning the LeN was an anti-democratic act, therefore it urged the government to release the ban and confirm the right to information of the public. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

Fr. Mike served Buttala with selfless love
	
In Monaragala?s remote Buttala village Buddhists revere Fr. Michael Rodrigo as a saint because of what he did for them and with them. Today, Fr. Michael?s 30th death anniversary, Buttala Buddhists will hold a similar ceremony to honour this religious figure. 
Human life, deeply rooted in God, nobly lived with a clear vision and depth of wisdom, with critical awareness and holistic understanding of the socio- economic- political reality, with unshaken conviction and selfless commitment, with undaunted courage and energetic zeal, totally immersed in the rough and tough life of the poor and down-trodden, such a noble life dedicated to the cause of humanity, founded on Kingdom values and attitudes, can never be snuffed out ad lib by the bullet of an assassin!? ?
On 10th November 1987 at 7.30 p.m, a shot was fired in Buttala! The physical life of Fr. Mike was brutally terminated! Thirty years have passed since that shockingly dark evening! And yet, Fr. Mike lives on with even greater vitality, vibrancy and fecundity in the minds and hearts, thoughts and sentiments, lives and spirit of those who knew him, of those who had heard him, of those who continued to be inspired by him. Fr. Mike?s vision of the Kingdom of the poor rooted in the heart of the Paschal Mystery; his message to the world on Justice and Truth and the equality of all persons including the most vulnerable and marginalized, his eco- friendly outlook on Nature and Mother Earth, continues to ring out loud and clear even in today?s context. Despite the years that have passed, the spirit of Fr. Mike, the strength and power of his life, the fragrance of his commitment, the nobility of his message of justice and truth, compassion and equality, continue to inspire our nation and all peoples! Thus he truly lives on. His spirit lives on today with so many of us, simple folks or highly intellectual stalwarts, or even spiritual giants!? ?
Let us listen to a couple of them.? ?
?
Bishop Vianney Fernando, a couple of days after the demise of Fr. Mike, had this to say:??? ?I knew Fr. Mike from the time I was a young seminarian. Having just returned after his doctoral studies from abroad he was assigned to teach psychology at the National Seminary. I happened to be among the first group of seminarians he taught. We loved his lectures. He was an excellent teacher. He was an intense person in whatever he did?. After the liturgical renewal launched by Vatican II, Fr. Mike spearheaded in Sri Lanka the implementation of the Conciliar reforms in liturgy. He responded with vigor and zest to the need of the day as he perceived it.
When my predecessor Bishop Leo Nanayakakra took over the newly carved out Diocese of Uva, Fr. Mike followed him. A new awareness was coming upon him. Preferential option for the poor began to be recognized as an integral part of the task of evangelization. Fr. Mike once again responded with zest and zeal, enthusiasm and profound faith. He opted out from his teaching career to be with the poor. He decided to enter into a dialogue of life with the poor peasants.
He opted to be with them to support them in their struggles. Above all he understood the deepest meaning of his ministerial priesthood as taking on the ?SERVANTHOOD OF THE KINGDOM?, following his Master and Saviour Jesus Christ. When threatened by forces that militate against such an option he carried on undaunted. And so finally he was brutally murdered. But the cause for which he died, the cause of God?s poor, lives on. It will be impossible to kill the ?Spirit? that inspired Fr. Mike?.. his spirit will live on, not only in his beloved people of Buttala, but as an inspiration to spur on thousands of others to opt courageously for the poor and the oppressed. (?He who opted for the poor?, Justice Vol.2, No 5-6, National Catholic Commission for Justice and Peace).? ?
?
?I am Maduri , a Buddhist from Buttala, who still holds as precious the life and message of Fr. Mike. A simple, humble and genuine Catholic priest, Fr. Mike inspired our whole village to all that was just and true, noble and humane, good and compassionate! Seeing him, speaking to him, and listening to his very rich and rare thoughts and sentiments communicated so graciously, we began to realize what God must be like, since we believed that Fr. Mike was a man of God who reflected by his very being, something of the Divine. Fr. Mike was a man of compassion and kindness, accepting the poor with such dignity and respect, without any discrimination or distinction, appreciating all that we were in our poverty and lowliness, drinking from a coconut shell if and when offered, seated on a mat or on our mud floor with such facility and ease, always making us feel great while he made himself small! Later we came to know that Jesus was also like Fr. Mike, or, was it that Fr. Mike was like Jesus!
He is now no more! 30 years have passed since that fatal day, and yet we feel he is with us, inspiring us to think maturely and wisely, serving others with selfless love, reaching out to the most distressed and oppressed ones in society, to be a concerned, caring and sharing people, to care for Mother Earth and preserve her from destruction and degradation, to shun violence and promote lasting peace with justice, and to think critically of the prevailing socio-economic-political reality of the country. He initiated a process of friendly dialogue and co-existence at Inter-faith level, which continues to inspire us to this very day.
Thank you Fr. Mike, for bringing light and life to us and to our families, nay to our whole village! As you have enlightened and inspired us thus far, may your spirit continue to live on among us. I salute you with deep respect and gratitude ! (Maduri).
?
	Caring and sharing people, to care for Mother Earth and preserve her from destruction and degradation
	
	
	When the prevailing current keeps on pushing us towards profit-making, almost drowning us in its din, we sense the presence of Fr. Mike?s spirit
	
	
	As all martyrs do, he has allowed the manner of his death to project a large picture of his life that was until then hidden from the rest of the country
	
?
Bonnie and Rose Galhena , fromTudella have this to say: ?Fr. Mike is very much remembered by us, not merely because our Montessori, blessed by him, is named ?St. Michael?s Montessori?, but mainly because of the vision and missionary thrust he shared with us so simply and genuinely, right from its inception. Throughout the early stages of our struggle to get started , Fr. Mike was a tower of strength and a beacon of light for us, animating, motivating and energizing us to shun the prevailing social current of greed for prestige, wealth and power, and instead, to be gospel-oriented along the path of justice and truth, while building God?s Kingdom through our Child-Development venture. While maintaining quality education in the line of Dr. Maria Montessori, we have imbibed the spirit of Fr. Mike who inspired us at every moment to be child-friendly, moving away from competition and profit-seeking, while upholding the dignity and rights of every child without any discrimination or distinction. The under-privileged child has an equal place in St, Michael?s Montessori, be it at work or at play, or at the display of their potentialities and talents. At every turn of decision-making, when the prevailing current keeps on pushing us towards profit-making, almost drowning us in its din, we sense the presence of Fr. Mike?s spirit, which is the spirit of Jesus, prompting us, above all else to keep our vision and missionary thrust in its proper perspective, always geared towards Kingdom Values of the worth and dignity of all God?s children!! This gospel spirit has spread during the past years among the staff, as well as among the parents of the children of St.Michael?s Montessori, thanks to Fr. Mike.
The theme song of St. Michael?s Montessori, MITHURANI, SATHURANI, was composed by Fr. Mike, and we sing it during important occasions to this day. The spirit of Fr. Mike is very vibrant and alive among us ! He truly lives on!
?
Fr. AloyPeiris, S.J. in the Foreword to ?JOURNEY FOR JUSTICE?, by Nandani Gunawardena, launched on November 6 at the Centre for Society and Religion, says : ?Fr. Mike was a true follower of his meek and humble Master.Not clinging to his prestige in the academe or his family status, he climbed down the social ladder to share the life-struggle of the politically victimized and economically exploited peasants, and paid a heavy price for it with his precious life?.having become obedient unto death ?. ; but God exalted him as a martyr to justice, inspiring a number of clerical and lay groups to start new gospel-based movements for ensuring religious harmony and social justice. He did not die in vain ?. As all martyrs do, he has allowed the manner of his death to project a large picture of his life that was until then hidden from the rest of the country and which was marked by a fearless fidelity to the gospel? Yes, very much like his Master?. he has risen in the hearts of so many that no one can muffle his voice now.?

Giving medicine  that much needed feminine touch
	
Kumar and Clark?s Clinical Medicine is one of the most acclaimed international publications in medicine for undergraduates and junior doctors. It?s considered as the bible in the subject of medicine by many Sri Lankan medical students, including this writer.?
Only recently did I get to know that the famous ?Praveen Kumar?, of the Kumar and Clark?s? Clinical Medicine was, in fact, a woman. I was very thrilled by this fact not because I am a woman, but because contrary to popular belief, medicine still very much a male dominated field.??
?While around 50% of the student population who enter medical faculty are females, only a small percentage of them make further progress, either in the academic arena or in other specialized fields. Even when they choose to specialize in, it?s found that there are fields that women are ?expected to specialize in?. Some fields like orthopaedic surgery are by definition ?testosterone only? fields. But the situation is improving steadily and hopefully there will come a day when I don?t have to feel proud because a ?woman? achieved something big in the field of medicine, because everyone would be judged on their talent and not by gender.??
My article isn?t going to be a ?feminist? piece, but hopefully this will grab the attention of everyone who have aspirations to elevate themselves from where they are now. I say this because women in medicine have experienced a slow journey where they have had to shed a lot of blood sweat and tears on the way.? ?Before 1800?s, women were banned from enrolling at medical schools. A female was considered too intellectually inferior to become a doctor. Dr. James Miranda Steuart Barry, born in 1790?s, was one of the first western female doctors to qualify in the recorded history of medicine. Known to the world as James Barry, she managed to join the military as a surgeon and became the second highest medical office. She also performed one of the first successful caesarean surgeries all the while concealing the fact that she was a woman, for 56 years. Her sex was revealed only after her death, when her body was being prepared for burial. A few years later, Elizabeth Blackwell became the first woman to enter a medical faculty. It?s ironic that after being rejected from more than 29 medical colleges, she was finally accepted, not because the administration recognized her qualifications, which surpassed those of her male peers, more as a joke. History reveals that the faculty?s administration decided to allow the male dominant student population decide if they should have a female peer or not. The male students offered their consentment to have her for amusement sake. It is said that there were many slack jaws on the day that she actually turned up for lectures. She continued to amaze them by continuing to be present and by graduating as batch top. The hardships she faced were only the beginning of a long journey. Even after obtaining the highest marks, she was banned from practicing medicine by the medical community because she was a woman. She continued despite the hardships and opened up the first all female medical school in America. Later, many courageous women followed her path, including Dr. Rebecca Cole; the first black female doctor in America, Eleanor-Davies Colley; the first accepted member of the Royal College of Surgeons.??
Their entrance to the field of medicine didn?t benefit only the women who planned to pursue medicine as their career. Since women started practicing medicine, they could empathize with the problems that female patients faced while?obtaining treatment.?
?
?
This they did better than their male counterparts. This resulted in improvement where treatment for women was concerned; for an example the focus on preserving the dignity of the patients during procedures such as pelvic examinations. This aspect when treating female patients wasn?t considered important until then.??
Today, many of my role models are doctors who are also women. But I?m still amazed at the daring attitude displayed and the courage shown by those pioneer women in medicine, who had little or no rolemodels to inspire them. Their medical dreams were realised despite the challenges from society which came in the form of antagonism and sceptism. This was all because females dared to dream big in the field of medicine.? ? ?

GMOA threatens TU action
	
The GMOA yesterday threatened to resort to trade union action if the government would not reveal its stance on SAITM to the Supreme Court through the Attorney-General's Department before Monday.
GMOA Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said in a statement that the SAITM had not met up with the needed legal standards and the government had decided to abolish it and added that however such a decisive decision had not been informed to the courts accurately by State Counsel Sanjaya Rajaratnam who is representing the Health Minister.
?The facts needed for the courts have been concealed through the Attorney-General's Department. A crisis is likely to arise, if a contradicting decision would be given by the courts at the end, as to the stance of the government,? he added.
He said that the government would have to inform its decision to abolish the SAITM and also its basis, to the courts through the Attorney-General's Department before November 13, in order to avoid any further issues.
He also said that a responsible State Counsel should be appointed for further hearings of the court case with regard to the SAITM instead of State Counsel Sanjaya Rajaratnam, since the GMOA no longer had any faith on him.
?The GMOA will arrive at a final decision with regard to the trade union action, following an emergency Executive Committee meeting which was scheduled to be held on Tuesday (14),? he added. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)

Is Astrology a science?
	
??There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio, than are dreamt of in your philosophy.? Shakespeare?s Hamlet Act 1 Scene 5
Punning on the bard?s words, one may say that there are more things in heaven and earth than are acknowledged by modern science.?
Scientific theories to justifying calling Astrology a science?
Those who believe in Astrology very often draw upon new discoveries and developments in modern science in support of the validity of Astrology as a science. Some learned persons have banked on the Theory of Relativity and the Quantum Theory to establish that Astrology is scientific and therefore is a science. Some years ago Indian scientist Prof. Raj Kumar drew inspiration from the Neuron Principle to prove that Astrology is truly a science.
What is Astrology?
Astrology is generally described as the study of the correlation between the positions and movements of cosmic bodies ? planets in particular on life and environment on earth. However, many eminent astrologers in India have, while acknowledging that man and all physical processes on earth are influenced by the physical forces of Nature, taken up the position that Astrology is a body of knowledge built up on the Law of Karma or Kamma.?
Science and Law of Karma
But does science take cognizance of the Law of Karma or is it possible to prove scientifically that there is a thing called Karma?
If we are to confer the status of a science on Astrology, we have to explain scientifically how Law of Karma operates. Is there a mechanism by which the accumulated result of our thoughts and deeds gets stored for it to manifest in our present birth or in future births??
In fact, Astrology is a body of knowledge our ancient sages built up both through insights gained by meditation as well as years of study done by observation and experimentation of the patterns of the effects cosmic bodies made on man and his environment.??
In the course of their study they discerned a definite relationship between the pattern of Karmic potential of an individual and the celestial map ? the configuration of planets ? at the particular moment of time and place of his birth. The data, they thus unraveled was codified using a symbolic language.?
Is Astrology fatalism?
If the results of people are Karma so pre-determined, does it mean that he has no control over what happens to him? Is he an utterly helpless of victim of an agenda pre-determined??
Ancient Indian sages have not propounded such a fatalistic viewpoint. Though subjected to the results of his own actions, man still enjoys power of a free will. He can modify or steer clear of the effects of his previous actions by the proper exercise of his free will.?

The Vavuniya Division Anti-Vice Squad said 2.266 Kg of heroin worth more than Rs.30 million has been taken into custody on Thursday when it was on the verge of being transported to Colombo from Jaffna.
A suspect from Jaffna who was about to board a bus to Colombo, was nabbed by officers of the Anti-vice Squad who had taken him into custody on a tip-off received by them at the Vavuniya bus stand. They had received information that the suspect was a resident of Velvetithurai in Jaffna through whom it had been arranged to send heroin to Colombo.
A team of Police officers under the directions of Senior DIG Roshan Fernando in charge of the Northern Province and the DIG in charge of the Vanni Division, Deshabandu Tennakone had taken the heroin into custody. (Romesh Madhushanka)

Kitty Ritig:  A life laid out on canvas
	
Former World Chess Champion Anatoly Karpov once wrote a book titled Chess is my life. Viktor Korchnoi who challenged him twice and lost (In Baguio City] 1978 and in Meran, 1981) also wrote a biography with the same title. Most top chess players if asked what their life is all about may very well say ?Chess?.
That is the way with professionals. Their lives are made of what they do. It consumes them, it gives life-breath, it empowers, generates meaning and reason to live. One can ask about childhood, adolescence, youth, middle-age and old age. One can ask about family, neighbourhood and country. One can ask other things.
All things considered, one would probably conclude that such things are incidental. Good for the historian and perhaps a sociologist or anthropologist who wants to read the particular times and landscapes through the individual, but for the person concerned, if he/she is willing to talk, it is just about the work.
When I saw Kitty Ritig at work I didn?t know if art was her life. All I knew was that she had meticulously conjured a Perahera in the heart of one of Colombo?s older residential areas, Thimbirigasyaya; to be precise at a quaint restaurant on Skelton Road called Sooriya Village that is officially dedicated to art and artists of all kinds.
I saw her diligently working on a panel skirting the central part of the restaurant, interrupted by only the ornate doors of wood and glass. The panel, around five feet above the floor and maybe eight inches wide, was not there a year ago. The panel, made of wood recycled from a garage, which was turned into a studio, had been put up with the idea of depicting icons in the music industry and their greatest hits.
Sanchitha Wickramasooriya, the proprietor, had later decided that they should go for something more creative, something that draws from tradition but is more contemporary following the general theme of connecting past to future. And so they found a connector. Kitty Ritig.
Kitty Ritig is not high on life history. She is high on art. So let us pass on history irrelevant to art. This, then, is her Art Story.
It begins with her grandmother who was and is headstrong and independent. She was a watercolour artist in 1950s. Kitty speaks glowingly of her.
?My grandmother was an amazing teacher. She used recycling and up-cycling to spark creativity in me. She taught me to paint, collage and sculpt. She had a massive collection of fairytales, folk tales and mythical legends. She painted a vibrant and fantastic world in my head from these stories. I think as a result of all this I saw a different world even in ordinary life.? Later there had been other influences. Osho, for example. She had begun reading Osho while still in school. The lifestyle and paintings of the hermit painter Rajhu was another big influence at this stage of her life.
?Then there was a time of uncertainty whether to select painting as a career or to settle for something far more secure by way of assured income. Yet the fantastic world that my grandmother had laid foundation within me would not let me settle, but always led me to art adventures.?
In this artistic journey, one of the turning points was the period she worked as a gallery assistant at Saatchi Gallery, Chelsea, London. Exposure to contemporary art and artists from all around the world had rejuvenated the artist within her. ?Even though I practised as an artist all my life, my art education was informal until this time. So when I came to Sri Lanka I pursued other career paths. However, at some point I came to identify that my ikigai or ?reason for being? was art. And so I decided to withdraw from the world and inhabit my ikigai. My husband and my religious beliefs were my biggest influences during this period.?
Her first formal art education was at the Vibhavi Academy of Fine Arts where she studied drawing and painting and started reading art history. At the same time she completed her degree at Sri Jayawardanapura University, reading English, English Literature and Methodology as writing had also been one of her earlier passions.
?I did not settle for a certain medium but experimented with many traditional media such as charcoal, oils, watercolours, collage, acrylic and ink as well as with digital applications such as Photoshop and Illustrator.?
Thereafter she came out, so to speak. She came back to the ?world? in the form of art. It began with Open Brain, a biweekly event organised by Stagelessarts.com. This, she says, was her first informal exhibition. Since then she has been working as a freelance artist on various collaborative projects and commissioned works. Later she joined AMDT (Academy of Multimedia Design and Technology) Colombo as a lecturer in drawing and illustration and presently, she is studying Art History for her Masters Degree in Fine Arts at University of Kelaniya.
?
"Kitty Ritig hasn?t exhibited her work. Yet. She has her masks and her camouflages, but her work is out there for anyone to see, admire, critique and be inspired by. She is on instagram as @kittyritig and her Facebook page as Kitty Ritig."
Kitty spoke about her work at Sooriya Village.
?It was Sanchitha?s idea. He wanted Sri Lankan traditional art styles to be the main inspiration. I did my research before planning the painting. The transition from Central Kandyan School to the Southern School fascinated me. Today commercial artworks are critiqued through the lenses of European Academic Art Styles. But in the past we had these art schools which celebrated freedom and beauty while borrowing, merging and rising against stagnation.?
?As an artist in Sri Lanka I find it is interesting to hybrid long- ?taken for granted? Sri Lankan concepts/legends/ideas with nowadays popular art genres/mediums. This is a long road. I have only just started walking and I hope to keep walking in the years to come.?
Kitty Ritig hasn?t exhibited her work. Yet. She has her masks and her camouflages, but her work is out there for anyone to see, admire, critique and be inspired by. She is on Instagram as @kittyritig and her Facebook page as Kitty Ritig.
She is currently based in Colombo where she lives with her husband. She believes in God and continues the sustainable lifestyle introduced by her grandmother.
?I am blessed to have good friends and not one but two families who embrace my artistic weirdness; my own family and my husband?s.?
She has created an identity that makes it hard for anyone to categorize or put her in a box. Kitty, after all, is pretty non-descriptive and Ritig could place her all over the world map, everywhere and nowhere in particular.
No matter. Paintings speak for themselves and that?s what counts, she would probably say. The discipline that is necessary is apparent in the work itself.
Even someone who is not really a student of this art form would immediately note the skill of the artist and her ability to express herself. The blend is not just of colours and/or medium, but of metaphor.
It tells many stories, and there?s something you can take with you after a gaze-brush on the canvas. If this is just a beginning, relatively speaking, one can hope for more delight, more insight and a richer gaze-experience in the coming years.?

LIOC contemplating fuel price hike
	
In a move that will further deepen the prevailing fuel crisis, the Lanka Indian Oil Company (LIOC) is reported to be planning to increase fuel prices within the next few weeks if the government fails to remove the special taxes imposed over the years on fuel.
Reliable petroleum sources told Daily Mirror that the LIOC was selling petrol at a loss of Rs.22 on a litre while it was losing Rs.16 on a litre of diesel. ?The reason for these losses was because of the special tax of 13% imposed earlier on a litre of fuel. Even the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation has to pay these taxes but that money goes back to the government coffers. So it is not a loss for either the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) or the Ceylon Petroleum Storage Terminal Limited (CPSTL) but only to the LIOC,? sources said.
They said LIOC officials recently met Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera and other top-level government officials and an assurance given when they requested that this tax be removed. ?In the event the taxes are not removed as promised, the LIOC Board of Directors will take decision to go ahead with the planned increase. The LIOC cannot sustain itself any longer with the staggering losses it is incurring. Either the government should remove the taxes or increase fuel prices to avert further losses,? a source said.
When asked as to what the increase would be a sources said that he was unable to make any comment because it was the responsibility of the management to decide on any change to the current prices.(Nirmala Kannangara)

## Title: Marxist head and  the Cultural heart

Marxist head and  the Cultural heart
	
The second of four articles delving into the Left movement in Sri Lanka
There?s a story from the 1971 insurrection that intrigues me even today. This story, I heard or rather read about from Malinga Gunaratne, who had in turn heard it from Victor Ivan. Apparently Victor had been arrested, interrogated, and imprisoned for his involvement with the insurrectionists and a series of attacks they had masterminded on Police stations throughout the country.
One of those attacks had involved a frontal assault on the Kadugannawa Station and had been led by a man whom Victor had met later on. What this man had done had roused him. The man?s name was Senerath, by the way.
What had happened was this: Immediately after the assault, Senerath had played the role of a Police Inspector in Charge of the Station. He had acted so well, in fact, that he had been able to give orders and run the show (so to speak) until the attacks were quelled and he was arrested.
Now Victor had been interested by what he had done, so interested that he had been thrilled when a family member had given him a lunch packet to deliver to the man. Owing to his background in sociology perhaps, he had been able to wring out answers to the kind of questions he asked from Senerath, and so after handing him the lunch packet, he went straight to the point: Why did he dress up like that? The answer, which Victor related many years later to Malinga Gunaratne, had moved him to tears.
?
	Caste structures were once sharply enforced in Sinhala society...? Senerath had to suffer. ...
	
	
	Morphed into a Left...having a cultural heart and pseudo-Marxist heart.
	
	
	It was also this same New Left that, asserted that homo-sexuality and bisexuality were totally alien to and unacceptable in Sri Lanka
	
Senerath came from the village. From an early age, he had wanted to go to school and join the Police. He had a problem though. He came from the Dhoby Community. Strange as it may seem today, caste structures were once sharply enforced in Sinhala society. For that reason, Senerath had to suffer. He was not allowed to go to a proper school. He had no one to support his application to join the Police. Worse, he was shirked by other more privileged boys. Having grown up shouldering this humiliation and seeing his dreams trampled on, he had done what most other boys, his age, would do. He had joined the JVP.
The assault on the Station had thus brought him an opportunity that he had never before come close to. What happened after he was released, whether he got to the life he had clamoured after, however, Victor does not tell us. In any case, it doesn?t matter.
There?s an interesting passage in Ranbanda Seneviratne?s ?Ula Leno? I visit again and again. The song, incidentally, was about the 1971 insurrectionists and their hopes:
?
<U+0DC3><U+0D82><U+0DC3><U+0DCF><U+0DBB><U+0DDA> <U+0DC4><U+0DD0><U+0DA7><U+0DD2> <U+0DAD><U+0DB8><U+0DBA><U+0DD2>
<U+0DC0><U+0DD2><U+0DBA><U+0DDD><U+0D9C> <U+0D87><U+0DAD><U+0DD2> <U+0DC0><U+0DB1><U+0DCA><U+0DB1><U+0DDA>
<U+0DB1><U+0DD2><U+0DC0><U+0DB1><U+0DA7> <U+0D9C><U+0DD2><U+0DBA><U+0DAF><U+0DCF> <U+0DB8><U+0DDA>
<U+0DC4><U+0DD0><U+0DB8> <U+0DAF><U+0DD4><U+0D9A> <U+0DB1><U+0DD0><U+0DAD><U+0DD2> <U+0DC0><U+0DB1><U+0DCA><U+0DB1><U+0DDA>
Ranbanda was writing about the insurrection, yes, but in these lines he was asserting what those against the insurrection had, patiently, been telling the would-be revolutionists: that what they suffered and endured was part and parcel of their miserable, samsaric life, and that they must continue to suffer and endure because it was, sadly, a universal truth. What transpired in and after 1971, however, was politically and socially interesting and uncomfortably paradoxical: the New Left, which had emerged in the sixties as a reaction against the apathy of the Trotskyites and Communists and what-not, did not take or affirm the rhetoric of revolution that had run riot before. In other words, they were no longer idealists envisioning Utopias. They wanted action, not policies, not manifestos. Gunadasa Kapuge?s lament was genuinely, movingly humanistic. But the values that this rather humanistic period of our history entailed were soon to erode, and for good reason.
It was that inexplicable, rather pathetic contradiction ? between the stated aims of an equal society and the largely bourgeois ethic of the leadership of the country ? which bred and fermented two bloody insurrections. They eventually morphed into a Left movement that Malinda Seneviratne once demarcated as having a cultural heart and pseudo-Marxist heart.
I would take issue with the latter label and revise it as follows: what 1971 and 1988 bred, in terms of the New Left, was a political movement that had a Marxist head and a cultural heart. They had repudiated the vanguard movement and all its ideological pretensions simply because they knew that any split between the leadership and the membership would breed an insidious kind of a conservative, reactionary society within their own ranks, affirming and sustaining a rift between those who could speak English and those who could not. Malinga Gunaratne himself wrote of this new-found suspicion of those who could speak the lingo, when once he was restrained from speaking for these radical leftists because he did not come from their class, their backdrop.
In other words it wasn?t the ?saadukin pelena wun? rhetoric of the Old Left that would rouse the working class, rather the fiercely passionate, rooted, and at the same time culturally pluralistic Pawana rhetoric of Sunil Ariyaratne and Nanda Malini. It is always tricky if not inadvisable to compare the objectives of a revolution with the lines and verses of revolutionary art, but in the songs of those two artistes we come across the kind of sensibility that the New Left, including but not limited to the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna, stood for: as I mentioned before, a cultural heart and a Marxist head, which affirmed the aspirations of the South (territorial integrity, with no capitulation to foreign entities) and the aspirations of the North (embracing every race, every creed, as one).
To me this is best represented in the final few lines of the Pawana album?s most menacing song, Budun Daham (which even more menacingly is tuned as a virinduwa):
<U+0DC3><U+0DD2><U+0DC4><U+0DC5><U+0DD4> <U+0D85><U+0DB4><U+0DDA> <U+0DAF><U+0DD9><U+0DB8><U+0DC5><U+0DD4> <U+0D85><U+0DB4><U+0DDA>
<U+0DB8><U+0DD4><U+0DC3><U+0DCA><U+0DBD><U+0DD2><U+0DB8><U+0DCA> <U+0DB8><U+0DD2><U+0DB1><U+0DD2><U+0DC3><U+0DD4><U+0DB1><U+0DD4><U+0DAD><U+0DCA> <U+0D85><U+0DB4><U+0DDA>
<U+0D8B><U+0DB1><U+0DCA> <U+0D9A><U+0DB3><U+0DC0><U+0DD4><U+0DBB><U+0DD4> <U+0DB6><U+0DAF><U+0DD2><U+0DB1> <U+0DAF><U+0DD2><U+0DB1><U+0DDA>
<U+0DB4><U+0DBB><U+0DBA><U+0DB1><U+0DCA><U+0D9C><U+0DDA> <U+0DB6><U+0DDC><U+0DA7><U+0DD4><U+0DC0> <U+0D9A><U+0DD0><U+0DB4><U+0DDA>
The New Left?s project was therefore opposed to the political project(s) of the Old Left, in that while it sought to do away with chauvinism it was also opposed to intervention by foreign actors, the latter of which was covertly supported by elements from their ideological foes, the Trotskyites and the Communists (this can be inferred by a perusal of Susantha Goonatilake?s unfortunately neglected book Recolonisation, where he exposes everyone and anyone in our political sphere who abandoned the rebels from the New Left for reasons of political expediency, including several members of today?s NGO intelligentsia). The call to revolution, therefore, was potent, unbearable, unstoppable.
Whether the JVP or its many offshoots, before and after its entry to the democratic process, was able to reconcile the head and heart is a question to which even political scientists, let alone commentators, can?t supply an adequate answer. And why? Because of the deliberately vague, confused state of the New Left, then and now.
It was the New Left that eschewed race and faith for comradeship unhindered by class distinctions (which, by the way, was the fatal contradiction of the Old Left, since the platform of racial and religious harmony they stood for was undone by their economic status), yes, but it was also this same New Left that, through one of its more prominent members in our Parliament, asserted that homosexuality and bisexuality were totally alien to and unacceptable in Sri Lanka, despite its avowedly liberal attitude towards matters of such controversy. The heart, as always, remains cut off from the head. To an extent at least.
And while they were all trying to connect the one to the other, their ideological foes elsewhere were being overwhelmed by the most disastrous wave of anti-left movements that were being paraded by their financiers as pro-left.
The undoing of the Old Left was the undoing of Left movements everywhere in the eighties, a period that saw the end of the Cold War and the diffusion of political realities and conflicts between the unilateralists and the multilateralists, the latter of whom have more or less joined the former in their quest to prove and affirm Huntington?s Clash of Civilisations. The end of the Cold War was, therefore, accompanied by a culture of intellectualism which sought to substitute the class consciousness of the traditional Left for a new, ethnocentric conception of rights and justice.
Where the Old Left figured in all this, and what response the New Left had to it, opens up another topic, one which I will dwell on next week.

Mounting jeep safaris make Yala animals snarl
	
?
?
The overcrowding issue at Yala National Park has disrupted wildlife, jeopardized the nature experience of visitors to this facility and endangered the lives of animals. The Ministry of Sustainable Development took action to solve the longstanding issue.
Environmentalists,?former wildlife officials and even current officials of the Department of Wildlife Conservation (DWC) claim that due to mounting political pressure, officials aren?t allowed to carry out duties and solve the overcrowding issue at the national park
?
	Negative reviews of disappointed and depressed tourists, who have returned from the park, are gradually increasing in social media and other travel guide web sites.
	
	
	Dr. Sumith Pilapitiya, the Chairperson of the Subcommittee, pointed out that Yala?s Block 1 was affected by too many visitors. This was largely because visitors didn?t have access to the wildlife in Blocks 3, 4 and 5.
	
	
	The limits on vehicles the DWC announced at the instruction of the Minister of Wildlife, has now been increased on three occasions by none other than the Minister himself, who introduced the limits.
	
	
	The issues and purposes which made Wildlife Minister Perera to make such a decision still remain unaddressed and unsolved. But, he increased the number of vehicles in a day to 500.
	
Overcrowding and its repercussions
Overcrowding isn?t a situation that was created overnight in the Yala National Park (Yala). The visitors to the national park have increased over 1000%, from 43,368 visitors in 2008 to 658, 227 in 2016, according to Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority (SLTDA) data.? ?
Catering to the demands made by local and foreign tourists, the number of commercial safari jeeps in operation has also risen. The total number of jeeps operating in Yala in 2016 was around 600. Former Warden of the national park, Suranga Rathnayake, took steps to register all the safari jeeps bringing visitors to Yala.?
?
However, the number of safari jeeps has skyrocketed by now. As stated by Independent Safari Jeep Drivers Association, attached to Yala, there are over 1200 commercial safari jeeps operating at present.? ?
?
Infrastructure Inadequate
?
Washrooms in rest houses located inside the park
?
It is reported that the infrastructure at the national park hasn?t been designed in a way that would cater to the hundreds of people visiting this facility, each day.? ?
In an interview with the Daily Mirror, a senior official attached to the Yala National Park said, ?The huge increase in visitors to Yala has made the facilities at the park seem inadequate. We can?t wait and watch anymore. The authorities need to come up with a new management plan to utilize our resources?.? ?
He said that the rest houses within the park had only two washrooms to serve the sanitary needs of visitors.? ?
?
?How can animals walk in their habitat when hundreds of jeeps are passing them every day? This will largely affect animal behavior and their reproduction procedure in the long run. At this rate, there wouldn?t be any animals in the park in the future.?
A Senior Spokesman of the DWC speaking
on the condition of anonymity"
Inadequate staff
As stated by the official, Yala has employed only 75 guides to work at the park. When considering the number of tourist arrivals, it is obvious that providing a guide for each jeep is impossible.? ?
A Sub-committee which submitted ?An Action Plan? to Improve the Overall Wildlife Tourism Experience at Yala National Park (Block 1)? to the Policy Development Office of the Prime Minister?s Office, recently identified that the park lacks adequate staff and facilities such as patrol vehicles for Department of Wildlife Conservation (DWC) to regulate activities within the sanctuary.? ?
The Sub-committee, appointed by the Prime Minister, in order to look into overcrowding in popular tourist sites, such as, Yala and Sigiriya in 2016, is chaired by Former DWC Director General Dr. Sumith Pilapitiya.? ?
?
Huge traffic jams
As fleets of safari jeeps drive into the park daily, it naturally leads to crowding and builds traffic.? ?
Environmental organizations such as Wildlife and Nature Protection Society (WNPS) are critical on the errant jeep drivers who use mobile phones to update each other on animal sightings which leads to a number of jeeps speeding up and gathering at the same place, creating long lines of vehicles in the park.? ?
The DWC managed to ban mobile network operations in mid-2015 to combat this menace, but the ban was lifted shortly thereafter.? ?
?
?
?
Endangered lives
Statistics maintained by the DWC reveal that a large number of wild animals had died due to the high number of vehicles entering the park and the high speeds at which they are driven.? ?
A Senior Spokesman of the DWC speaking on the condition of anonymity said, ?Each year motor vehicles causing deaths of animals makes wildlife at the park take a toll. Some animals, especially leopards, become road kill for the speeding jeeps. Some accidents are reported in the media while many aren?t.?
? ?How can animals walk in their habitat when hundreds of jeeps are passing them everyday? This will largely affect animal behavior and their reproduction procedure in the long run. At this rate, there wouldn?t be any animals in the park in the future,? the official affirmed.? ?
?
?
Violations of law on the rise
?
It goes without saying that once the number of visitors becomes unbearable, the instances of violating wildlife laws would rise as well.? ?
Environmentalists claim that jeep drivers and visitors don?t adhere to the law.? ?
Not only normal jeep drivers, but there was also reports of a powerful politician in the area having acted inside the park as if it was his own property. Visuals of the said minister stopping his vehicle to take photos and blocking the road, creating traffic congestion in the process, were subject to criticism once uploaded on social media.? ?
?
Less focus on other blocks in Yala
Dr. Sumith Pilapitiya, the Chairperson of the Subcommittee, pointed out that Yala?s Block 1 was affected by too many visitors. This was largely because visitors didn?t have access to the wildlife in Blocks 3, 4 and 5.? ?
He emphasized that other blocks at the Park should be promoted ahead of Block 1; where all the chaos is taking place.? ?
He assured that other blocks, especially block 3, has a density of animals similar to Block 1. Then, traffic would be diverted, he said.? ?
?Although the Plan recommended the closure of Block 1 for 3 months every year?this is to encourage visitors to travel to other blocks?it was decided by the Minister of Sustainable Development and Wildlife that the park will be closed for 2 months this year and then extended to 3 months from next year. However, the Minister of Wildlife and another politician representing the interests of jeep drivers instructed the DWC at a meeting on October 18th, to open Yala earlier than planned and to introduce limits to the number of vehicles entering the park,? he said.?
?
?
Negative reviews by tourists
Meanwhile, negative reviews of disappointed and depressed tourists, who have returned from the park, are gradually increasing in social media and other travel guide web sites.?? Below are some selected reviews from foreign tourists and a local tourist who wrote on Trip Advisor about their travel experiences at Yala. ?
?
? With so many jeeps crisscrossing the national park, there is no chance of sightings.?
- Akshay Hejjaj Bengaluru, India
?
? Once in the park it was absolute chaos. The drivers were obviously just there to drive and had no passion or thoughts for the welfare of the animals.?
- CaroleH Warrington United Kingdom ?
?
? Unfortunately for the park and the animals, there are hordes of tourists crisscrossing the area in diesel vehicles. It must be stressful for the local animals.?
- Marie Claire S Windsor Canada
? ?
?When we visited the park there were too many safari jeeps. We got the feeling that priority was more on business than on the quality of lives of the animals.?
- Patrick B? Italy
?
?We saw more jeeps than animals. Yala has to set a rule where there can be a maximum number of jeeps allowed in the park at a given time. Right now it?s just a circus and a money machine.?
- Robbertj? Netherlands
?
?There are just so many Safari trucks. Everyone comes rushing over and you find yourself amidst a giant jam of cars and diesel fumes.?
- Heide K Morris New York
?
?Jeep drivers speed recklessly, with no regard for customer safety or protecting animals. All they do is answer their phones and speed to the next sighting.?
- Naren G? California
? ?
?Unfortunately safari jeeps everywhere tend to ruin the experience as they race around the park as if in some kind of competition.?
- Ibdal? Denmark
? ?
?Great place to see the elusive Sri Lankan Leopard, but its ruined by Jeep drivers. And I personally have seen a top level politician driving around in his private vehicle and blocking the entire road when an animal is spotted, so that he could take pictures. Someone needs to change the system if not, Yala will not last long?
- Nigel P Sri Lanka
?
Grievances of Jeep Drivers
?
?From star-level enterprises to small scale shops, all the business entities in Tissamaharama will face problems with the decline of income from tourists who used to pour into the park daily. All we want is our business to continue smoothly.?
S.P.Sugathadasa, driver who has been working in Yala for almost thirty five years
Wildlife Minister Gamini Jayawickrama Perera decided to limit the number of jeeps entering the park during a day to 450 ?300 in the morning and afternoon sessions. This rule is applicable for jeeps using the Palatupapana entrance. Efforts will be taken to limit the number of jeeps using the Katugamuwa Entrance in the morning and afternoon sessions to 150. The environmentalists commended his decision, but said that the way in which it was implemented, without any awareness and preparedness, can?t be accepted.? ?
Regarding the issuing of tickets, 8 am and 2 pm were announced as deadlines; both during the morning and evening safari rounds. How did jeep drivers, the main community group that benefits from the influx of tourists in Yala respond to the new regulations?? ?
They claimed that the new regulations posed a threat to their livelihood. They even staged a demonstration blocking the entrance roads to the Park claiming that they have faced severe injustice. Shops in Tissamaharama pulled down shutters in protest.? ?
As jeep drivers and jeep owners stated, below are the problematic situations and grievances that they are facing due to the restricting of vehicles.? ?
?
Unhealthy competitions
President of Independent Jeep Drivers Association P.D. Keerthi, told the Daily Mirror that limiting vehicles would cause road accidents as jeep drivers have nothing else to do other than driving fast with the aim of obtaining the tokens first.? ?
?According to that regulation, ticket counters at Yala are closed sharp at 8 am after starting issuing tickets at 6 am. When many tourists arrive late and they have to return disappointed. We used to pick tourists up at 5 am and stay in the queue for an hour or less. We will have to pick up tourists at least by 4 am to be included in the first 150 vehicles. The problem is that tourists aren?t keen on being picked up as early as 4am. Once we pick them, we will have to drive fast to obtain the tokens first, else our business is gone for that day. We won?t be able to maintain the speed limit of 30 kmph due to the tough competition that exists to enter the park,? Keerthi remarked.? ?
?
Drivers, pushed to become poachers
It goes without saying that there is no other group of people like jeep drivers who know Yala like the palms of their hands. Due to the fears of losing their livelihood, the circumstances will push them to become poachers, Dr. Pilapitiya warned.? ?
Dr. Pilapitiya, who resigned from the post in June, last year, due to an unbearable political backlash, said that immediate action taken to restrict the number of vehicles will adversely effect the jobs of many drivers.? ?
?It is impractical and ridiculous to find overnight solutions for issues that have existed for many years. Hasty decisions will lead to new issues. When drivers feel insecure about their jobs, they look for alternative earning opportunities,? he said.? ?
Commenting on what Dr. Pilapitiya predicted, President of Independent Jeep Drivers Association P.D. Keerthi said they can?t give a guarantee that affected drivers would restrain from poaching activities unless they are provided with other options in the future.? ?
Even Minister Jayawickrama Perera in an earlier interview with the Daily Mirror accepted that a poaching mafia is in operation in many forests belong to the DWC, including Yala.? ?
?
Collapse of business entities
S.P. Sugathadasa , a driver who has been working in Yala for almost 35 years, told the Daily Mirror that business entities based on tourism in Tissamaharama would suffer due to the limitation of vehicles entering the park.? ?
?From star-level enterprises to small scale shops, all the business entities in Tissamaharama will face problems with the decline of income from tourists who used to pour into the park daily. All we want is our business to continue smoothly,? he said.? ?
Commenting on limiting the jeeps, Dr. Pilapitiya said that the sub-committee headed by him felt that it wasn?t practical to introduce limits to vehicles until Yala Blocks 3, 4, 5 and Lunugamwehera National Park are developed for wildlife tourism.? ?
?This will take a couple of years, so the Committee recommended that vehicle limits to Yala Block 1 be introduced in a phased manner commencing in 2020. In the meantime, the introduction of a uniflow system within Yala, strict enforcement of discipline against drivers violating park rules, speed bumps to regulate the speed of vehicles and an extension to the closure period of the park, were among the 31 short term, 7 medium term and 2 long terms actions recommended in the Action Plan,? he stated.? ?
Turning his focus on the plan, he said, it was even endorsed by the Prime Minister?s Office and DWC was instructed to implement the plan, which they commenced. However, as with everything in Sri Lanka, politics took center stage and there was political interference in a professionally prepared plan.? ?
Even though jeep drivers protested, Minister Jayawickrama Perera told the media that the regulation wouldn?t be relaxed.?
?
Increasing number of vehicles to?500
Out of the blue, the Minister of Sustainable Development and Wildlife Gamini Jayawickarama Perera on Wednesday decided to increase the number of safari jeeps accessing the Yala National Wildlife Park to 500 a day.? ?
The limits on vehicles the DWC announced at the instructions of the Minister of Wildlife, has now been increased on three occasions by none other than the Minister himself, who introduced the limits.? ?
This new decision has drawn angry responses from environmentalists and wildlife activists. According to the information received by the Daily Mirror, the decision had been taken amidst opposition of some senior officials of the DWC.? Minister Gamini Jayawickrama Perera, Minister Sajith Premadasa, Director General of the DWC M.G.C.Sooriyabandara, Director of Planning of the DWC Ranjan Marasinghe and four jeep drivers associations attached to the Yala Park attended the meeting.? ?
?
Minister Premadasa mediates
Speaking to us after the meeting, President of the Independent Safari Jeep Drivers Association P.D.Keerthi said it was minister Sajith Premadasa, local politician from Hambantota district, who fixed the meeting with Minister Jayawickrama Perera for jeep drivers to present their demands.
During the said meeting, Minister Perera also decided to extend the time period during which ticket counters are open for visitors. Accordingly, the ticket counters will be open from 6 to 11 am and 1 to 2 pm.?? Thanking the Minister Premadasa, Keerthi said they are satisfied with the decision that was made.? ?
?
"?Thanking the Minister Premadasa, Keerthi said they are satisfied with the decision that was made"
?
DWC?s plan to implement online booking withdrawn
The DWC was planning to introduce an online tickets booking system for visitors entering Yala. Sources close to the Department said the relevant officials had already started developing the software for the system.? The jeep drivers associations opposed the online ticket booking system because they feared it will eat into the extra income that they generate by selling tickets to foreign tourists at higher prices, a senior DWC Spokesman told the Daily Mirror.? ?
During Wednesday?s meeting, Minister Perera instructed the DWC to withdraw the online tickets booking system, disregarding the effort of the relevant DWC officers. ?The department had put up banners in English informing foreigners about real ticket prices. The jeep drivers showed opposition and the authorities instructed the staff to remove these banners. The mafia of jeep drivers is all empowered by politics,? he said.? ?
?
Former DG detests involvement of politics
Dr. Sumith Pilapitya criticized the new decision and said wildlife will subject to more repercussions.? ?
?I for one, was totally opposed to the early opening of Yala and limiting the number of vehicles all of a sudden. I was shocked that the politicians had decided on a limit to the number of vehicles, when everybody except obviously the two of them, knew that they themselves will overturn their own ruling due to pressure from the jeep drivers. This is exactly what has happened. The limit of vehicles entering the park has been increased to 500 per day following a decision taken by the Minister of Wildlife on November 8, 2017, just 20 days after his first ruling to limit the number of vehicles,? he said.? ?
Dr. Pilapitiya was also of the view that allowing 500 vehicles to enter the park every day is like having no limit at all because 97% of the year, the number of vehicles entering Yala Block 1 is less than 500 vehicles.? ?
He further went on to say, ?It is unfortunately the DWC as the custodians of wildlife has to make an announcement to increase vehicles, making them look indecisive and unprofessional.? ?
?I was opposed to placing limits on vehicles entering the park until the other surrounding parks are developed and wildlife sightings are improved in these parks, because one doesn?t need to be a rocket scientist to realize that the politicians don?t have the backbone to implement the decisions they themselves make. So now we have meaningless limits on vehicles, which is another attempt by the politicians to hoodwink the public and conservationists. This is because the new limit is higher than the number of vehicles actually entering the park, except during the December holiday season?so basically there is no limit. Had the DWC been permitted to stick to its plan, this mess wouldn?t have happened and the DWC would not have lost credibility.?? ?
?
"I was opposed to placing limits on vehicles entering the park until the other surrounding parks are developed and wildlife sightings are improved in these parks"
Specifically, speaking about continuous allegations of political interference at the Wildlife and Conservation Department, Dr. Pilapitiya said, ?The Government did nothing to manage this exponential rise in tourism in Yala over the past several years. We know that politicians are only interested in votes, so the livelihood of jeep drivers will be more important to them than wildlife conservation.? ?
?What has political interference done to the DWC?s management of Yala now? The Fauna and Flora Protection Ordinance mandates the DWC to protect, conserve and regulate wildlife resources and this mandate does not lie with the Minister of Wildlife. Yet decisions are made by the Minister, without advice from DWC and reversed against the advice of DWC, which has only served to demean the regulatory mandate of DWC and makes DWC look unprofessional in the eyes of the public.??
?
?
Several attempts made to contact Ministers Jayawickrama Perera and Sajith Premadasa proved futile. Minister Perera had underscored that he made the decision to restrict vehicle access to Yala for the safety and well-being of the animals and the preservation of the park. The issues and purposes which made him to make such a decision still remain unaddressed and unsolved. But, he increased the number of vehicles in a day to 500.
?
It poses a question as to what really happened to the ministry?s aspirations for the well-being of animals and conservation of Yala?

Myth  Buster
	
MYTH: Vaccines cause autism??
BUSTED:? ?This is definitely a myth. It is one of the biggest tragedies of our time, where a doctor falsified his research and published a paper which stated that autism is caused by the MMR vaccine (measles mumps rubella vaccine). This resulted in many people not taking the vaccine, which led to many illnesses, deaths and deafness. It was then proven that he had fabricated most of his research and he was struck off the register. It was one of the largest blows to the vaccination efforts and they have still not recovered from it. Vaccines are the single most important breakthroughs in reducing infections. In the olden days people used to have many children because only a few children would survive to adult life because of infections such as tetanus, diphtheria, mumps which were all killer diseases that reduced the population of the children at the time. Now we hardly ever hear of these infections causing mayhem as they are all preventable by vaccination. We should congratulate Sri Lanka as 95% of children receive the vaccines that are provided free by the Government.? explained Dr. Enoka Corea, Senior Lecturer, Department of Microbiology, Faculty of Medicine, Colombo.?

No point of allocating Rs 270mn for NEC: Herath
	
Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) Parliamentarian Vijitha Herath today charged that there was no point in allocating Rs 270 million through the 2018 budget for the National Economic Council (NEC) as the country?s economic reforms were being handled by the Economic Committee headed by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.
Therefore he questioned whether there was a need to pump more money into the NEC as the duties are already being handled by the PM's committee and as such would end up getting duplicated.
He said this shows that the present government has no economic vision for the nation and added that the budget 2018 was only going to add an additional burden onto the public. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

Respiratory health hurdle
	
Pneumonia
There are always many health hurdles to clear. Days set aside in the world to remind citizens of maladies is a great way to raise awareness against them. World Pneumonia Day falls on November 12, reminding us to strengthen our guard against Pneumonia. If medical attention is sought on time, pneumonia can be cured completely. If left untreated, it could be fatal. A cough or a cold doesn?t always signify a case of Pneumonia. It could also indicate other respiratory problems such as asthma or even bronchitis. So how do you know if you are suffering from pneumonia? Dr. Geethal Perera, Consultant Respiratory Physician of the Sri Jayawardanapura Hospital enlightened us on this subject during an interview done with Health Capsule.??
?
Simply put, Pneumonia is the inflammation of the lungs. ?The respiratory system of our body consists of nose, throat, trachea, bronchi, lungs, etc. The disease affects air spaces in the lungs known as lung parenchyma,? said Dr. Perera. Pneumonia which starts in the lungs can give rise to sepsis affecting the blood, kidneys and?other organs.? ?
He said that infectious types of pneumonia are more common. ?There are cases of Pneumonia that take place due to autoimmune diseases. But these cases of pneumonia are rare. Infectious cases of Pneumonia take place due to microbes such as viruses and bacteria. Other micro organisms such as fungi can cause pneumonia too,? explained Dr. Perera.??
Viral Pneumonia??
Viruses are a cause for Pneumonia. Influenza A viruses can lead to viral epidemics and during such plagues one has to take care. ?There are many viral infections including influenza that don?t affect the lungs initially. So there is no cause to panic. But when viral pneumonia occurs, it damages the lungs, making it easy for other microorganisms such as bacteria to invade and multiply, thus aggravating the condition. This leads to drastic situations,? Dr. Perera further explained. The respiratory physician further indicated that care has to be taken especially during plagues when viral diseases such as H1N1 influenza spreads. This is because the immune system weakens, paving the way for micro organisms that cause pneumonia.? ?
Bacterial Pneumonia??
These cases of pneumonia are caused by bacteria. Dr. Perera said that the most common cause of Bacterial Pneumonia is the bacterium, Streptococcus. ?These bacteria are naturally found in the upper respiratory tract such as the nose and the throat. They don?t cause harm under normal conditions. when people aspirate due to different reasons, throat secretions get into the lungs. The throat secretions will contain the Streptococcus bacteria as well. When they enter the lungs in large quantities, Pneumonia could occur . This is especially harmful for a person who has weak lungs.This is the most common form of bacterial Pneumonia,? he said.? ?
According to Dr. Perera, environments in places like hospitals and ICUs contain many virulent and drug resistent microorganisms. These micro organisms when inhaled get colonized in the throat. These organisms can also cause harmful?Pneumonia conditions.? ?
?
Taking?antibiotics?irrationally will destroy the natural micro organisms in the throat. Thus the harmful micro organisms enter the lungs when aspirated. The Pneumonia condition caused this way is more?severe
?Taking antibiotics irrationally will destroy the natural micro organisms in the throat. Thus the harmful micro organisms enter the lungs when aspirated. The Pneumonia condition caused this way could be difficult to treat,? said Dr.Perera.??
Usually bacterial Pneumonia is acute, but in contradiction, tuberculosis is a condition that doesn?t infect a person acutely. ?This means that your body won?t respond immediately to the micro organism causing tuberculosis, hence symptoms won?t appear immediately. Pneumonia due to Tuberculosis develops slowly over a long period of time,? he accentuated.??
Risk groups??
Dr.Perera listed persons who have a higher tendency to contract Pneumonia. ?patients with a tendency to aspirate such as stroke patients can fall victim to Pneumonia. Bed? ridden patients who are unable to move are susceptible to hypostatic Pneumonia. Patients with immunosuppressive diseases are in the risk category as well. Due to their weak immunity, they can?t guard against lung infections and these could lead to Pneumonia. They include children in disadvantageous communities- who suffer from malnutrition and rheumatoid- arthritis patients, the elderly, HIV patients, kidney patients and patients who have undergone transplants. These patients should also take extra care,? he warned.??
High fever with chills, shortness of breath, being lethargic, in the chest, an initial dry cough that develops in to a wet cough are some of the symptoms, according to Dr.Perera. Coughing out blood or pus is an immediate signal that you should consult?your physician.? ?
When to seek medical help??
Dr. Perera added that the disease depends on the patient. ?If a person is suffering from severe symptoms and is in the risk category, it is advised to seek medical attention within 3 days after observing the symptoms. If it is a patient who has undergone a transplant, the patient should seek help immediately within a day of experiencing the symptoms. If a healthy person suffers from symptoms of a common cold, such as a running nose, and if they aren?t short of breath, it is advised to take fluids and bed rest and observe whether the condition subsides. If it persists even after 3-5 days, it is advisable to consult a doctor who will assess the condition and provide appropriate treatment.Correct antibiotics should be started after proper assessment by a qualified doctor at the right time,? notified Dr.Perera. He also stated that there are cases where people suffer from coughs for more than 2 weeks, but assume it is just a cold and nothing severe. Unlike pneumonia, tuberculosis isn?t an acute disease. This could be a sign that you are suffering from tuberculosis, so seeking medical attention at the right time is important.? ?
Diagnosis of the disease??
A chest x-ray and blood test will be called for the purpose of diagnosis when coughing become persistent. The physician will look for any signs of pneumonia (or tuberculosis) using the x-ray. ?In the case of bacterial pneumonia treatment and appropriate antibiotics will be prescribed. When pneumonia is diagnosed early hospitalization isn?t necessary, but that?s if the condition of the disease is uncomplicated. But follow ups are necessary to ensure the complete cure of the disease is achieved. More severe, complicated forms of Pneumonia will require hospitalization,??
he advised. Viral Pneumonia won?t respond to antibiotics. Drugs known as antiviral drugs are available in the treatment of Viral Pneumonia. A very few antiviral drugs are used to treat viral infections. ?These drugs aren?t used commonly. If overused, the viruses become resistant to them as in the case of bacterial resistance development to antibiotics. They are issued to in-house patients in hospitals under a prescription. Anti viral drugs can?t be bought over the counter at pharmacies,??
Dr.Perera stressed.??
Prevention??
Some forms of Pneumonias are contagious. So preventing the spread of disease is important.??
?Hand hygiene is vital. Wearing a mask is advised if you are suffering from a cough or cold. It prevents you from touching your face with hands soiled with bugs.? After people blow their noses or rub their noses using their hands, they might touch their faces with these hands. This can spread the germs. The best method in preventing the spreading of a disease is to prevent others from catching your cold or cough as they are contagious. The contraction of these diseases could lead to Pneumonia in aggravated conditions with a weakened immunity. Avoiding alcohol and smoking is also advised.
Getting drunk tends to lead to aspiration which could cause Pneumonia,? he informed.??
?Pneumococcal vaccines are available. It is a preventive method. Patients suffering from long-term lung diseases and immune compromised patients- including patients under the risk groups- can receive vaccination on the recommendations of a consultant physician.??
? ?Antibiotic abuse causes resistance in bacteria. Therefore taking antibiotics at initial stages of a disease without proper diagnosis can be harmful. This affects the natural microorganisms in the body, paving the way for harmful ones to enter the system that causes disease,? explicated Dr.Perera. After all, you may be suffering from just a cold and it may not be serious. All you may need is symptomatic treatment (excluding antibiotics) and bed rest.??
?It is believed by many that having baths can cause pneumonia. This is completely false!!!,? concluded Dr.Perera.??

SriLankan to be operated on a PPP soon: Mangala
	
The Government hopes to operate the national carrier SriLankan on a public-private-partnership and is currently discussing this matter with several business entities including Qatar Airways, Finance and Mass Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera told a media briefing today.
"Government is unable to bear the burden of this loss-making airline any further and is exploring other options on how best to operate this airline," he said.
The minister said SriLankan would be converted into a public-private-partnership or PPP in line with Thursday's Budget proposal to initiate such partnerships to effectively manage State entities.
He said the banks would not be allowed to burden the people with the debt re-payment levy, which was one of the new taxes introduced in the 2018 Budget.
The minister said it was actually a ?Medamulana tax? because the revenue thus collected would be used to repay the huge loans obtained by the previous government.
With regard to the new tax formula on liquor introduced in the Budget, the minister said under the new proposal, strong alcoholic drinks will be subjected to a tax of 84 per cent while light alcoholic drinks will be subjected to a tax of 13 per cent while the tax on a litre of beer has been reduced to Rs.100 from the current tax of Rs.190.
"The fees charged for the issuance of Passports, National Identity Cards, entry to national parks such as Yala and the National Zoological Gardens had been increased because they have not been changed for the past three years," the minister said and added that these fees had been increased by 15 per cent from January 1, 2018.
"The government has presented a blue-green budget while focussing on aspects which none of the previous budgets had looked into," he said and highlight the fact that one such proposal was the provision of loans up to Rs.200,000 to GCE Advanced Level students who failed to enter universities so that they could pursue higher studies.

## Title: Tackling  child obesity   in a developing world
## Section: Medicine

Tackling  child obesity   in a developing world
	
The world around us is developing rapidly, and this advancement sometimes comes at a cost. Obesity results from a sedentary lifestyle and an unhealthy diet. These two factors are a huge drawback in a country?s progress, especially with low and middle income countries. Obesity is a worrying condition especially with children. It has the potential to negatively affect the future generation. According to the WHO, in 2016, the number of overweight children under the age of five was estimated to be more than 41 million, worldwide. Even more alarmingly, almost a half of these children were estimated to be living in Asia. Similarly, childhood obesity has become a big problem in Sri Lanka too. Therefore, we contacted Dr. Shanthi Gunawardena, Consultant Nutritionist at the Ministry of Health to clear doubts associated with Childhood Obesity, its causative factors and the preventative measures that we could take.??
?
How does one identify childhood obesity?
?
Even though we use Body Mass Index (BMI) as a form of measures in monitoring weight in adults, the same can?t be done with children because their bodies undergo many physiological changes when they are young. ?We have growth monitoring charts to monitor their growth during childhood,? said Dr. Gunawardhana.?
?
A child is exclusively breast fed until he reaches the age of 6 months. And if the child is healthy and sufficiently breastfeeds there should be a steady growth. This growth can be monitored using the growth chart in their Child Health Developmental Record (CHDR). After 6 months, complementary food is introduced into the diet in addition to breast milk. If the child is over fed or under fed, we could again identify from the CHDR?, explained the doctor.??
?
The child?s weight is continued to be monitored and recorded up until preschool years in the CHDR. In school too School Medical Inspections are conducted and obese children are referred to the MOH or the hospital nutritionist. ?Even parents can measure their child?s BMI, and compare it with the chart included in their CHDR, which covers all ages up to 19 years of age. If the child is between the normal weight ranges, he should be within the green coloured lines,? she elaborated.? ?
?
What is the cause of Childhood Obesity?
?
The most common cause for obesity is the energy imbalance between the calories consumed and the calories expended. The high calorie, high salt diet as well as the physical inactivity are the usual culprits.??
?
According to Dr. Gunawardhana, most cases of childhood obesity present after the age of two years, because they are completely weaned off milk and are eating the family diet by that time. So the fast food, refined sugar and high salt that are included in the family?s diet become part of their diet too.??
??Most parents or babysitters are used to feeding children with biscuits and fast foods (short eats) to keep them from fussing. These foods are high in carbohydrate and sugar content. They usually sit the child in front of the television and feed them while watching the teledramas etc., As a result more food than required is usually fed to the child unknowingly,? explained the doctor. ?Even when the family is following a healthy diet, children may be attracted by the eye catching
?
?
?
advertisements associated with fast foods and demand them. This leaves parents with no alternative, but to buy these fast foods,? she said.??
?
Eating salt rich food also contributes to weight gain because they increase water retention. If such foods continue to be present in the diet for a long time they may give rise to more serious conditions like high blood pressure and even heart attacks, warned the doctor. ?Formula feed also contributes to weight gain because of the composition which is different to that of normal breast milk. Therefore Formula feed should not be used as an alternative for breast milk without medical advice,? she cautioned.??
?
She also explained that the lack of physical activities resulting from the modern recreational activities popular with children, like video games, mobile and watching television, also play a major part in weight gain. Most urban houses lack space outside for children to play, and even when there is enough space, parents are reluctant to let children play,? fearing they?ll fall and injure themselves,? she elaborated.??
?
Rarely, the cause of obesity may be an underlying disease or a hormonal imbalance, like the thyroid deficiency, added Dr. Gunawardhana.??
?
Obesity outcomes
?
In addition to having a psychosocial issue worrying a child due to stigmatization as ?fat?, which may result in long term behavioural changes, obesity in long term affects a child?s physical health significantly.??
?
Childhood obesity has a high risk of continuing into adulthood, which will give rise to a multitude of problems including Diabetes, Hypertension and High Cholesterol, early in their lives. ?Children as young as 10 or 11 years present with Diabetes and even heart attacks, and the main cause for this is obesity,? Dr Gunawardhana said. They are also more likely to develop some forms of cancers like colon cancer and osteoarthritis.??
?
In addition, overweight girls are at a higher risk of early menarche. They are more prone to develop a condition called Poly Cystic Ovarian Syndrome, which causes a girl to develop masculine features like growth of facial hair and to cause sub fertility later in their lives, she explained.??
Treatment and prevention
?
?When an obese or an overweight child is presented to a nutritionist, we obtain the history from them, including a dietary history. Investigations may be needed to exclude pathological obesity, which is a result of other underlying disease conditions,? said the doctor, further explaining that after excluding other causes, the child and the guardians are given advise on dietary and lifestyle modifications.??
?
?Ideally, our diet should include a minimum of two types of vegetables, one type of green leaves, and two types of fruits per day, which should be distributed throughout the meals. 6/8 glasses of water per day is recommended. However this may change depending on the amount of activity or the climate etc. Less than five teaspoonfuls of sugar and one teaspoonful of salt is the ideal amount per person,? said the doctor, adding that usually a 175ml bottle of soft drink carries more than 5 spoonfuls of sugar.??
?
?Every child should be allowed to play outside for at least one hour per day,? stressed Dr.
Gunawardhana. She further stressed that physical activity like running around, climbing and jumping was recommended.
?
She also had a warning for parents of infants and toddlers. ?Parents tend to think that chubby children are cute and ignore the doctors advises in preventing obesity. This should be discouraged because obese babies have a very high chance of developing into overweight adults,? she cautioned.??
?
She concluded the interview, stressing on the importance of preventing both obesity and malnutrition by maintaining the child?s weight keeping with his age and the height by following a healthy diet and an adequate physical exercise programme or activity.??

## Title: The evolution of Gigivitis

The evolution of Gigivitis
	
Many of us ignore the pain we feel in our jaw, striking it off as a toothache. we regard this as a trivial problem. But this ?trivial? problem could worsen as you continue to ignoring it. This is how people develop periodontitis. Speaking to the Health Capsule Dr. Vipula Wickramasinghe, General Secretary of the Sri Lanka Dental Association and Regional Dental Surgeon of the Colombo District, explained that the most common reason for the loss or extraction of teeth is due to periodontitis.??
?Explaining what periodontitis is he said, ?You can simply say that it is an extension of gingivitis. However, gingivitis involves only the gingiva. Whereas periodontitis is a disease that involves the tooth, the gingiva, the alveolar bone, the tooth bearing bone, and the periodontal ligaments, which connect the bone and the tooth. The inflammation of these three tissues is called periodontitis?.?
He further said that according to the last oral survey, which are results from 2003 and the last available statistics, 27% of people over 60 years of age don?t have a single tooth in their mouth. He explained that it is a very bad outcome and the last oral health survey was done in 2013, but the results are yet to be released.??
Causes
Speaking of how periodontitis is caused Dr. Wickramasinghe said, ?If you don?t treat gingivitis properly it leads to periodontitis. In gingivitis you have the inflammation of the gingiva. The plaque in the gingival pocket, with the calcium and the saliva it gets hardened, that makes calculus. When left untreated, bacteria in that calculus will inflame the bones and the periodontal ligaments. This is the same bacteria and the same scenario as gingivitis, but it is a more aggressive form of gingivitis.?? ?
Symptoms
He further explained that there are two types of symptoms. Those which are visible to the naked eye and those which are seen after examination. ?The symptoms that can be seen through the naked eye are the redness and the swelling of the gingiva. When you touch it there may be a discharge of pus. You may also have a lot of caluculii around the tooth and there will be slight or high mobility of the tooth,? he continued.??
?After an examination you will see very deep pockets and there will be bleeding and discharge of pus. There will also be a very bad odour and a very high degree of mobility with regard to the tooth,? said Dr. Wickramasinghe.? ?
Risk factors
Speaking of the risk factors Dr. Wickramasinghe said, ?People who do not brush their teeth properly fall into the high risk group. In Sri Lanka the main reason for periodontitis is the fact that dental hygiene has not been maintained since childhood. Furthermore, people who are diabetic are much more prone to periodontitis and people who are immune compromised, people who take immune substitute drugs for example cancer patients and HIV patients. There are also people with poor nutrition. There are certain drugs, medication for other diseases which can bring?
about periodontitis?.?
Prevention?
He further stated that prevention is better than cure. ?People should be advised that if they have any sort of bleeding or any sort of plaque surrounding the tooth they have to consult a doctor. Untreated gingivitis can progress to periodontitis,?said?the doctor.?
?We must prevent people from getting gingivitis. Both the doctor and the patient play a part in this. Proper brushing and maintaining good dental health, seeking advice from the doctor on taking medicines and mouthwashes and manual cleaning and other type of treatment are essential. If you have done that you won?t fall it. But there is a certain percentage of people in whom the gingivitis process takes place due to genetic reasons. One should mandatorily visit the dentist once in six months and this should be a regular part of one?s life. It is more important to focus on the prevention of gingivitis rather than on treatment,? he continued.??
Treatment
Dr. Wickramasinghe explained that the treatment for periodontitis is a little more complicated than the one given for gingivitis. ?The proper oral hygiene instructions must be given to the people and then cleaning of the teeth, maintaining good oral hygiene, controlling diabetic level or other disease level are essential,? advised the doctor.?
?There are some advanced treatment for periodontitis such as a bone graft or a gingival graft. But in Sri Lanka, the most common treatment that is done for adults is exfoliation or extraction of teeth. Due to mobility a lot of people lose their teeth because of periodontitis. It is very important that you maintain your oral hygiene from your childhood, otherwise at the later stages in your life you will develop periodontitis. The most common cause for the extraction or the loss of teeth in adults of over 50 years is due to periodontitis,??
he concluded.? ?

Correct procedure for wearing gems?
Before the explaining the effects and significations of precious stones or metals, we wish to briefly explain the correct procedure to be followed in wearing precious stones.
The precious stone or the gem is usually studded in a ring or other ornament. No matter where and how the precious stone is used it should be remembered that part of its surface should touch the skin and another of it exposed to the atmosphere.??
The upper part of the stone should be open to attract the radiation from the atmosphere and the lower part should touch the skin so that the radiation could pass into?the body.
Free from any blemish
If a jewel, gem, or a stone is to give its full beneficial effect, it should be free from any defect, a spot, a crack or any other blemish. The gem should be genuine, not cultured or artificial.
Varaha Mihir, the famous Jyotish Guru of ancient India has set apart a full chapter to gems and precious stones in his celebrated work, Brihat Samhita.?

1) Ruby 2) Pearl 3) Coral 4) Emerald 5) Yellow Sapphire 6) Diamond 7) Blue sapphire 8) Hessonite Garnet (Gomed) and 9) Cat?s Eye
