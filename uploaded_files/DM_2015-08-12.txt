Video: All use State resources PAFFREL
	
	The ruling party and the Opposition have both used State resources and State powers to get an advantageous situation during the forthcoming elections, a leading election monitoring body, Peoples Action for Free and Fair Elections (PAFFREL) said today.
	PAFFRELs Executive Director Rohana Hettiarachchi told a news briefing yesterday that there had been 131 complaints on using State power and resources to the elections out of which 88 were confirmed.
	"There has been 392 complains of election law violations and other incidents against the United National Front for Good Governance (UNFGG) and 376 against United Peoples Freedom Alliance (UPFA), 34 against the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) and 29 complaints over other parties, he said.
	However, Mr. Hettiarachchi said the political culture seemed to have change for the better, when considering the situation this time.
	He made this by comparing the incidents pertaining to assaults during the general elections of 2010 and 2015. Accordingly there had been 71 cases of assaults in 2010, while there had been 35 this year, according to him.
	The political culture had improved but it has to be sustainable, Hettiarachchi said.
	Another interesting disclosure made by Mr. Hettiarachchi was that most of the complaints had been received from general public unlike during the previous elections, where complaints were lodged by members of political parties.
	PAFFREL will deploy 13, 754 monitors on the Election Day, while there will be 25 mobile monitoring units with two monitors and 25 mobile units with four monitors in identified areas. (Yohan Perera and Darshana Sanjeewa)

Paddy Marketing Board considers taking MRIA stores
	
The Paddy Marketing Board was looking at the possibility of using stores at the Mattala Rajapaksa International Airport (MRIA) to store the paddy harvest of the Hambantota District in the Maha season, a top official told the Daily Mirror today.
PMB Chairman M.D. Dissanayake said they had requested the authorities to look into the matter after learning that there were some vacant stores at the MRIA.
However, Dissanayake said they had not reached a final decision as yet regarding the matter and added that it was a normal practice to use stores of other government institutions such as stores of army, Food Commissioner Department and Co-operative Development for storage facilities.
It is not a new practice. We have already used stores belonging to the Army and some other government departments for storage facilities, he said.(Ajith Siriwardana)

	There had been fewer violations of electoral laws so far and the poll seems to be cleaner than the Presidential Election, the Commonwealth Election Observers said today.
	The Chairman of the Observer Group, Former President of Malta Dr. George Abela told a media briefing that that observers were here in January during the Presidential Election and that they could see that the general elections seem to be cleaner than the Presidential Election.

SLIM Gamata Marketing adds new flavour with Fish Bonanza
	
The Department of Marketing, Faculty of Management and Finance, at the University of Ruhuna, in collaboration with the Sri Lanka Institute of Marketing (SLIM), are engaged in a bold endeavour to organize an event, Fish Bonanza, with the aim of amplifying the performance of the fishing community in Matara.
Moreover, the Department of Food Science and Technology, Faculty of Agriculture of the University of Ruhuna has extended their support to make this event a resounding success,by providing the required technology tothe entrepreneurs to produce various types of value additions to fish products. Accordingly, fortysmall scale entrepreneurs were selected and trained to add value to fish, which enabled them to innovate and introduce a new product into the market. They were also empowered with the required marketing skills which are essential in a profit seeking enterprise, to create mutually satisfactory situations for the customer as well as the entrepreneur.
Highlighting the importance of the event, Prof. H. S. C. Perera, Dean, Faculty of Management and Finance, University of Ruhuna, said: Most of the universities in the world develop their status as entrepreneurial entities for the purpose of developing entrepreneurs who would contribute positively to the national growth of their countries. Universities should not limit their duties to teaching and research only. They should also engage in such activities as an important element of corporate social responsibility, he further said.
A. C. Karunaratne, Head of the Department of Marketing, University of Ruhuna stated that he is very proud to be a part of this worthy project. He reiterated that it is our duty and responsibility to uplift the economic and socio-cultural standards of entrepreneurs engaged in small scale enterprises, since they have now become a major component of a countrys national growth and revenue.
Stating a fact that was prevalent in the industry, Ruwan Liyanagamage, President of SLIM said, Even though the fish harvest is rich in the southern part of the country, the fishing community is not financially stable. They utilise traditional technology and systems in harvesting and processing, and value additions have not been given due attention. The SLIM Fish Bonanza gives them a great opportunity, to proactively engage in a project where their skills, knowledge and profits are enhanced, which leads them towards a sustainable livelihood.
Dr. Nilantha Liyanage, Head of the Department of Food Science and Technology, Faculty of Agriculture of the University of Ruhuna, who is also actively involved in this project, stated that with the initial preparatory trainings conducted by various NGOs, Agencies, and educational institutes such as SLIM, as also the University of Ruhuna, the fishing communities have begun to employ the new technologies they have learnt, which goes beyond their traditional ways and means. He admired the enthusiasm displayed by the trainees at the workshops that were conducted. He urged that this joint endeavour not stop at Fish Bonanza  Matara, but continue with the momentum that it gained, to the next level, which is National.
The final event of Fish Bonanza is scheduled to be held at the Matara beach on 5th September, where the organizers have gone all out to put together an event which will be unforgettable for all.
All food lovers and fish lovers are invited to venture on a gastronomically enticing and adventurous event, which in the style of SLIM, is unlike any other.

He said this had gone to the extent of preparing false manifestos by interested people.
He also drew attention to a fake Facebook page, claimed to be party General Secretary Tilvin Silvas official FB page.

Meanwhile, he said his party had accepted the suggestion that voting rights be given to a person, when he or she reaches the age 16.

Susil: Will sack top management of SOEs
	
	A UPFA government formed after August 17 would replace the entire top management of State bodies with highly qualified new officials and immediately open inquiries on 70,000 files claimed to have received by the government, since January on corruptions and misdeeds at State commercial ventures, the UPFA said today.
	The General Secretary of the UPFA Susil Premajayantha charged that the yahapalana government did nothing in the last six months, but conspired against the SLFP and Rajapaksas at the Temple Trees, resulting in a glut of arrests and recording of statements of close associates and politicians of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa.
	Do not think for a moment that we would abandon inquiring of those petitions on corruption. But we would for sure remove Chairmen, Directors, CEOs and working directors or any other official appointed after January 8.
	We also have a closer look at the educational and professional qualifications and the integrity of top officials before they are appointed to top posts at Corporations, Commissions, Statutory Boards, Authorities and other commercial ventures as per the guidelines set out by the Committee on Public Enterprises (COPE), Premajayantha said.
	Premajayantha said the UPFA government in its 2015 budget proposals had pledged to rectify pension anomalies of retired public servants based on the 2015 salaries effective from July 2015.
	Until then the Rajapaksa government proposed to pay an allowance of Rs. 3,000 per month for pensioners until the anomalies were rectified in July.
	The yahapalana government has reversed that decision and has now decided to revise pensions based on 2016 salaries and to continue to pay the Rs. 3,000 allowance up to then, which is a loss to pensioners, he said. (Sandun A. Jayasekera)
