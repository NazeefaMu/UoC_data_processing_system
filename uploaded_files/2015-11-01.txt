FBI says no bomb in Maldives President boat blast
	
	The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) appeared Saturday to contradict findings of other fellow investigators including Sri Lankan forensic experts as the US agency said it had found no evidence an explosive device had caused a blast aboard a speedboat carrying the President.
	?? ?
	Following the blast, several countries were quick to dispatch experts to the Maldives to help local authorities in their investigation. The international team of investigators included experts from India, Sri Lanka, Saudi Arabia, Australia and the US.
	The Wall Street Journal quoted an unnamed FBI spokesperson as saying that an FBI review of evidence, including an examination of the scene and chemical trace testing, determined that debris from the blast at first considered possible remnants of a bomb were, in fact, parts of the boat.
	?There is no conclusive evidence to attribute the explosion on the boat to an IED,?? the spokesman told the reputed publication.
	The FBI?s analysis is in direct contradiction with analysis from other international investigators, including forensic experts from neighbouring Sri Lanka and Saudi Arabia.
	President Abdulla Yameen Abdul Gayoom and First Lady Fathimath Ibrahim were travelling to Male from the airport on September 28 when the explosion took place. They had returned home that morning after concluding their visit to Saudi Arabia to perform the annual hajj pilgrimage.
	The president escaped unhurt, but the first lady suffered a spinal fracture. She is still undergoing treatment at the state run Indira Gandhi Memorial Hospital (IGMH) in Male.
	A national enquiry commission set up to investigate the blast on Thursday had said traces of high grade explosives had been found in the chemical analysis of the blast.
	In a statement, the commission said the Saudi Arabia forensics report had said trace amounts of RDX had been found in the chemical analysis of the blast.
	President Yameen also said Sunday bomb making material had been found in some of the houses searched during the raids.
	He had also said that his vice president was arrested last week because he posed a threat to the country and was using his influence within the police force to impede the investigation into the blast.
	Vice President Ahmed Adheeb Abdul Ghafoor was arrested last Saturday over the blast and taken to the police detention centre in the island of Dhoonidhoo in Kaafu Atoll.
	Police jointly with the military had been conducting raids across the capital.
	Several of the vice president's associates had also been arrested while most of the residences raided by the authorities have had close links to Adheeb.

She described how she was repeatedly beaten by the police during the clash between the police and the students.
?We were washing our faces at the pond after the fired tear gas when policemen and anti-riot squad personnel suddenly descended on us and started beating us. I fell when I was beaten several times on my spine. Even then they did not stop beating me,? Sasini said. Meanwhile, Sasini?s father Kingsley Kumarasiri said they had received telephone calls claiming they were from the Cinnamon Gardens Police asking Sasini to report to the police to give a statement.

Karuna now blames Prabhakaran sting for leaving LTTE
	
	Vinayagamoorthy Muralitharan alias Karuna Amman, who was Special Commander of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in the eastern Sri Lankan districts of Batticaloa and Ampara, says that the rift between him and LTTE Supremo Velupillai Prabhakaran took place in December 2002 when the Tiger chieftain accused him of ?betrayal? of the kind Mahendrarajah alias Mahatthya was accused of in the early 1990s and executed.
	Prabhakaran was livid with Karuna for persuading his chief negotiator, Anton Balasingham, to sign the December 5, 2002 ?Oslo Declaration? which had committed the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam to ?exploring the possibility of finding a political solution based on a federal structure within a united Sri Lanka.?
	At a stormy Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam?s Central Committee meeting at Kilinochchi later in December, Karuna owned that he persuaded a reluctant Balasingham to accept the Norwegian Government?s draft declaration while other members of the LTTE delegation were either non-committal or suggested consultation with Prabhakaran before signing.
	Defending his action, Karuna said that he supported the signing of the Declaration only to ?save the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam from isolation? in the international community which had become hostile to armed movements following the September 11, 2001, terrorist attack in New York.
	?Prabhakaran was a good man, but he had no knowledge of globalization,?? Karuna told Indian Express.
	?At the special Central Committee meeting at Kilinochchi, Prabhakaran tore a copy of the Oslo Declaration to bits and accused me of selling out the struggle for Tamil Eelam. I tried to explain to him that the Declaration had only said that the two sides would explore a federal solution, not accept it. The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam could always quit the talks if these were unsatisfactory, I submitted. But my arguments fell on deaf ears.?
?However, the real sting was in Prabhakaran?s charge that I had betrayed him as Mahatthya (his Deputy) did earlier. This hurt me deeply, because unlike Mahatthya, who was planning to kill Prabhakaran, I was only trying to save him and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam,? Karuna said.
Sensing trouble, Karuna asked the European ceasefire monitors to urgently send a helicopter to fly him to his base in Batticaloa. ?Once in Batticaloa, I refused to answer summons to come to Kilinochchi, knowing full well what would happen if I did,? Karuna told Express.

LTTE detainees likely to be released before Deepavali: Marapana
	
Law and Order and Prison Reforms Minister Tilak Marapana said he hoped that the LTTE detainees could be released before the Deepavali festival on November 10, 2015.
Addressing the opening ceremony of the modernized prison near the Pannai lagoon in Jaffna on Saturday, he said the country?s prisons had about 18,000 detainees, but most of them were not those who should have been detained.
The minister said several of them had been put in the jail for minor offences or for want of legal aid. He stressed the need to focus special attention on them.
?The LTTE suspects on remand without charges being filed against them should be released. If they are considered a threat to law and order, they should be ordered to report to the police in the respective areas at regular intervals.
The suspects in cases that have been pending for years could be released on bail. President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe have instructed the Attorney General?s Department to take a decision in this regard soon.
Police take a long time to complete investigations and to file action against suspects and that cases drag on for more than ten years. This has created hardship to the suspects, their relatives, and even the judges and the lawyers.
This situation demands immediate replacement of the prevailing legal system. I am planning to reduce the number of detainees by at least 25 per cent," the minister said. (Romesh Madusanka)

Marapana should resign if police acted unilaterally: JVP
	
The Minister of Law and Order should resign his portfolio if the the police had unilaterally decided to baton charge the students of the Higher National Diploma in Accountancy (HNDA), the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) said today.
?
JVP Leader and Chief Opposition Whip Anura Kumara Dissanayake told a media briefing that the Law and Order Minister Tilak Marapana should resign if the police had on its own and without the prior knowledge of the minister had decided to attack the students during their protest last week.
"The indiscriminate attack only highlights the minister's failure to monitor and the direct the institutions under his purview," Mr. Dissanayake said. ?The Police is part of the government and the government cannot run away from its responsibilities."
He said the police had acted against the law because they could only hit a person below the waist but in this instance the Police were clearly seen hitting the students on the head as well.
Mr. Dissanayake said the students were compelled to go ahead with the protest because they were denied an opportunity to meet the subject minister by the ministry authorities.
He said he would make a special statement in parliament on Tuesday regarding the matter. (Yohan Perera)
