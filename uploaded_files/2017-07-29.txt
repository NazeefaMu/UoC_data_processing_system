Brand new system of governance  in the offing - Ranil
	
The premier speaking at the 17th Dudley Senanayake memorial lecture? reveals that the constitutional assembly will have to take some important decisions in the near future
?
?Many suggest that we return to the Soulbury Constitution?
- Prime minister Ranil Wickremesinghe
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe on Thursday indicated that
Sri Lanka may usher in a new system of governance as per the new constitution as circumstances don?t allow the country to return to a West Minister system which existed until the 1970s. Prime Minister Wickremesinghe made these comments at the Dudley Senanayake memorial lecture organized by Dudley Senanayake Foundation together with Friedrich Naumann Stiftung Fur die Freiheit at Temple Trees. The premier said the constitutional assembly will have to take some important decisions in the near future.? 
?
?Many suggest that we return to the Soulbury Constitution, but it may be difficult to return to this system of governance which existed until early 1970s. I say this because the parties have committed themselves to the maximum devolution of power unlike those days where the Government agents represented the state at the village level. However, today, there is a provincial council system. One has to consider the relationship between the periphery and the provincial councils. How do we share power between them? These are important issues. In a devolved government the first thing to be considered is the relationship between the central executive and the provincial executive,? Wickremesinghe said. ?
?Areas under discussion are the executive presidency and how to increase the power of Parliament, so that it could control the government. How to steer a government that is under the control of Parliament?. There are some parties who want the executive presidency to be abolished and others who want it retained. There are some others who want to return to a system based on Soulbury Constitution,? he added. ?
?
?
"Around the past ten years we have seen the strengthening of the presidency"
?
?Around the past ten years we have seen the strengthening of the presidency. We saw the strengthening of the presidency, expect during the time I was the Prime Minister under President Kumaranatunga. Since 2005 the presidency has been strengthened at the expense of Parliament. The House actually suffered. As a result the country fell into a deep debt. The debt the country has to repay has exceeded Rs 4 trillion. We found the chief justice being removed without going through an impeachment process. There was no resolution to remove the Chief Justice. We saw Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka being put in jail. We thought then that we should do away with the Executive presidency. That brought many forces together and a constitutional assembly was subsequently appointed. Before doing that the 19 amendment was brought in and some powers of the executive presidency were removed. We will have to see whether there should be a Parliament controlled government and what are the powers which an executive president should hold, whether the Prime Minister is directly elected or should we go for the US style where the party which obtains a majority of seats in Parliament gets to appoint the premier, or the Prime Minister is appointed through a confidence vote. Then we have to think of the electoral system. Are we to adopt the New Zealand system where 60% percent of the seats are elected under first past the post system and the rest are named under the electoral lists? These are the issues we have to discuss and decide upon. ?
?
?
"I say this because the parties have committed themselves to the maximum devolution of power unlike those days where the Government agents represented the state at the village level"
?
Six sub committees of the constitutional assembly have submitted their reports Thereafter an interim report will be presented to the assembly and, after a debate, a final decision will be taken,? Wickremesinghe further said. ?
The Premier paid a glowing tribute to his predecessor the late Senanayake and recalled how he got to know the late leader in the 1950s when he was just a student. ?During the time of Late Dudley Senanayake there was a different model of government. The late President Jayewardene proposed the introduction of an executive presidency in the 1960s, but Senanayake opposed it. Senanayake maintained that the existing system was best for Sri Lanka. Senanayake resigned from the UNP earlier in the 1950s and late Sir John Kotelawala became the leader of the UNP. He returned to politics later and led the UNP to victory in 1960 and in 1964 during which Sirimavo Bandaranaike?s government was defeated in Parliament when she tried to introduce a press council bill. Senanayake led the UNP to victory in 1965. Then came the Kalutara resolution where UNP accepted democratic socialism as a style of government,? he recalled?

?We don?t want a repeat of 1953?
- State Minister of Defense Ruwan Wijewardene
?
State Minister of Defense Ruwan Wijewardene, in his speech, compared the times of Premier Senanayake-who took full responsibility for the unfortunate incidents in the 1950s-with the period when the previous regime existed when he payed tribute to the late leader. He said the following in his speech. He also lauded the current premier as well.? 
?
?First and foremost on behalf of the Dudley Senanayake Foundation I would like to extend my heartfelt gratitude to the Prime Minister, Ranil Wickremesinghe for accepting our invitation to be the guest speaker at this event. Sir, we are truly humbled by your presence, inspired by your words and I can?t think of a more fitting person to invite to deliver the keynote speech in memory of the late Dudley Senanayake. I say this cause I believe that you share the same principles and values as the Late Prime Minister. No matter what obstacles and pressures that you have faced and experienced, you haven?t let that experience compromise your principles in any way.? ?
Your style of governance is much aligned to that of President J.R. Jayewardene. However your liberal values and democratic ideals are quite similar to that of Dudley Senanayake. But the similarities aren?t only restricted to values and ideals, but stretch to certain decisions and action you have taken throughout your career. ?
Senanayake was a man of principles. He was not hungry for power, nor did he allow ambition to drive him. He had a genuine love for his country and his people. Take for example the crossover of Deputy Prime Minister C.P. De Silva to the opposition in 1964. It led to the toppling of Bandaranayake?s SLFP government which resulted in an election that saw the UNP win with a comfortable majority.
Senanayake promptly offered the post of Prime Minister to C.P De Silva for he believed that it was solely due to C.Ps defection to the UNP that resulted in their win at the elections. Seldom do you find a politician who would offer his opportunity- to serve in the highest post of the land- to another, especially after a win. In a similar fashion, Prime Minister Wickremesinghe, as the Leader of the United National Party took a step back and supported the then General secretary of the SLFP Maithripala Sirisena to come forward as the common candidate for the Presidential Elections in 2015. ?
?
?
"No one has come forward to take responsibility for the death of Roshan Chanaka, Thajudeen, LasanthaWicramatunge and Eknaligoda and countless others"
?
The civil disobedience against the UNP Government in 1953 saw an escalation of violence, sabotage and destruction of government infrastructure across the island. The clashes that erupted between the police and demonstrators resulted in 10 casualties. The very next day Dudley Senanayake resigned as Prime Minister. As Prime Minister he saw it as his duty to take responsibility for their deaths. He couldn?t bear the fact that 10 valuable lives were lost under his tenure.? ?
Fast forward to 2013, to the town of Rathupaswela. Residents of the area demonstrated against a factory they believed was contaminating their ground water supply. The then government sent in the army to quell the demonstrators and as a result 3 young persons died of gunshot injuries. Till this day no one from the previous regime has come forward to take responsibility for the loss of those innocent lives. Similarly no one has come forward to take responsibility for the death of Roshan Chanaka, Thajudeen, LasanthaWicramatunge and Eknaligoda and countless others who went missing during the time of the conflict. ?
From 2013 we come to the present times where we are experiencing a very similar environment to that of the Hartal in 1953, with civil disobedience, trade union action and demonstrations becoming a daily occurrence. They have caused much hardship to the general public. Doctors are striking for reasons that aren?t related to their profession while an upsurge of dengue hospitalizes more than 100,000 patients and leaves 300 dead. Students who take advantage of the free education that is provided to them by the state- through taxes paid by you and I- are demonstrating against private universities and blocking roads and challenging the police. The trade unions are threatening to disrupt work in their respective field.? ?
All this has caused inconvenience and placed a huge burden on the public, so much so that some are questioning whether ?yahapalnaya? works? Critics have gone further and state that democracy doesn?t suit a country like Sri Lanka. They say they wish to see the previous regime back in power, clearly not thinking things through. But this is the sentiment of many. It?s time for tough action. Obviously we don?t want a repeat of 1953, but tougher action within a legal framework must be taken against elements that are determined to create social unrest for their political gain.? ?
?
?
"They say they wish to see the previous regime back in power, clearly not thinking things through. But this is the sentiment of many. It?s time for tough action"
?
Israel I believe, has a good method when dealing with trade unions. while trade unions in Israel are very powerful, however by law, they are bound to give notice to the state 14 days prior to the commencement of a strike. This gives the state two weeks to negotiate and redress the issues of the unions. ?
Ladies and gentlemen What I have mentioned before are but a few examples of Dudley Senanayake?s character that we can all learn from. It weren?t power and prestige he was seeking, but how well he can use the power of his office to serve his country and his fellow man. Abraham Lincoln once said and I quote ?Nearly all men can stand adversity, but if you want to test a man?s character, give him power?.? Dudley Senanayake never misused his office for his personal benefit. Even when his health was failing, he insisted that his doctors fees and travel expenses? be paid by his personal funds and not by the funds allocated to the Prime Ministers office by the state. He never surrounded himself with armed guards and back-up vehicles, rather he preferred to drive on his own. This is the conduct of an outstanding statesman that present day politicians should aspire to. ?
I believe we shouldn?t measure the character of a leader by the power he or she retains, or by the number of years they remain in power, but by the principles they live by and by their actions. Dwight D Eisenhower once said, ? The supreme quality for leadership is unquestionably integrity. Without it, no real success is possible, no matter whether it?s on a section gang, a football field, in an army, or in an office.? he said in his speech.?
?
?Dudley was a remarkable orator?
- D M Swaminathan Chairman Dudley Senanayake memorial Trust
?
Minister D.M Swaminathan too began by stating that there are similarities between the late Prime Minister Dudley Senanayake and the current Premier Ranil Wickremesinghe. But he said that there was only one difference and that was Senanayake was an old Thomian while Premier Wickremesinghe is an old Royalist. Swaminathan made these comments in a lighter vein.? 
?
Paying a glowing tribute to Senanayake, he said the late Prime Minister was a member of BAR after completion of his studies but that was before taking up politics. ?He was a remarkable orator and had a character of his own compared to the others in Parliament at that time like the late Colvin R De Silva, Dr N M Perera and S W R D Bandaranaike. Premier Senanayake was once stopped by a traffic constable and he congratulated this constable for upholding the law. This is why he scored more than other politicians during his time. ?
?
?
"Premier Senanayake was once stopped by a traffic constable and he congratulated this constable for upholding the law"
?
While mentioning that Senanayake was an eligible bachelor, Swaminathan went on to relate a story as to how the late leader got about looking for a suitable bride at the Ratwatte Walauwa in Balangoda. ?While the Senanayakes were having Watalappan for dessert, after dinner, the parents asked Senanayake?s opinion of the young lady they came to meet. Then Senanayake replied to his parents saying ?hari shook, hari shook? (very good very good when translated to English). Then his mother wanted to reconfirm Senanayake?s opinion on the bride as she wanted to make sure that her son will soon bring the young lady to to their home. She posed the question and Senanayake again gave the identical reply.? Senanayake?s mother was happy. Then Senanayake said ?no amma I referred to the watalapan when I said ?hari shook hari shook?. There would have been a UNP SLFP joint government if late Senanayake married that young lady from the Ratwatte Walvuwa,? Swaminathan said in a lighter vein.?

CEB to further restrict electricity supply to consumers
	
The Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) yesterday warned of a further restriction in the supply of electricity due to the reduction of hydro-power electricity generation as the water levels in the reservoirs had dropped drastically to 36 per cent of capacity.
CEB media spokesman Sulakshana Jayawardana said the daily electricity demand in the country had increased by over 2,400 megawatts (MW) with 44 Gigawatt-hours (GWh) used in the day-time alone.
Mr. Jayawardana told Daily Mirror that county?s total capacity is 4,000 MW and from that 1,350MW was generated using large scare hydro-power plants while another 350 MW was generated by small-scale hydro-power plants.
He said the prevailing dry weather has severely affected hydro-power generation with the need to supply water for drinking and harvesting necessitating further cuts in the supply of electricity to consumers. He requested the public to use electricity sparingly, especially during the peak period from 6.30 pm to 10.30 pm.
Meanwhile he said they had been trying to re-instate a private power plant at Kelanitissa which had not been operational for some time, however a technical fault was not allowing this to take place. He said the AES Kelanitissa power plant has a capacity of 163 MW.
On Thursday (27) Daily Mirror reported that a 110 MW gas turbine plant at the Kelanitissa Power Station had also tripped due to the dry weather situation in the area. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

China to help SL produce thin-film solar cells
	
Sri Lanka will be soon producing thin-film solar cells on a commercial basis with technological cooperation from China as a means of popularising the use of solar panels for domestic power generation, Science, Technology and Research Minister Susil Premajayantha said.
He said a number of young technicians were being trained on ?Modern Solar Power Technology? at the Colombo, Ruhuna, Jaffna and Kelaniya universities.
"I paid a visit to China last week with some Sri Lankan scientists to obtain first hand experience on solar power technology. The Chinese government is helping us to develop solar power technology in Sri Lanka. I hope we will be in a position to drastically reduce the use of costly thermal power generation which is also an environment pollutant,? the minister said.
He said producing it locally on a mass scale would help the government?s plan to phase out coal and thermal power generation and increase solar power generation to 800 MWs by 2030.
Thin-film technology has been cheaper but less efficient than conventional c-Si technology. However, its quality standards have significantly improved over the years. The lab cell efficiency for CdTe and CIGS is now beyond 21%, out-performing multi-crystalline silicon, the dominant material currently used in many solar crystalline systems.

JVP Leader and Chief Opposition Whip Anura Kumara Dissanayake told a media briefing that signing the agreement itself would not pave the way for the authorities to implement it. ?The parties may sign a paper today but the workers at the ports authority could always prevent it being implemented," he said.
The MP said the government led by President Maithirpala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe have been stubborn when it came to the signing of the Hambantota Port Project agreement. He asked how the signing could take place today when the President himself had assured the trade Union that the agreement would only be signed after obtaining the views of the Opposition.

Nawaz Sharif steps down as PM after SC?s disqualification verdict
	
ISLAMABAD/KARACHI ??
The Supreme Court on Friday disqualified Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif from holding public office in a landmark decision on the Panama Papers case. ??
Shortly after, the PM House issued a notification saying that Nawaz Sharif, despite having ?strong reservations? on the SC?s verdict, has stepped down from his post as the premier. Reacting to the court?s order, a PML-N spokesperson said that the party will utilise all legal and constitutional means to contest the verdict. ?
The decision brings Sharif?s third term in power to an unceremonious end, roughly one year before the scheduled general elections which would have seen him become the first Pakistani prime minister to complete a full five-year term. It is unclear at the moment who will be appointed to take over the post till the next general elections, which are scheduled for 2018. ??
The Supreme Court said the ECP should de-seat the PM for not disclosing his role in the Dubai-based Capital FZE company in his nomination papers, saying that this meant he was not ?honest?. ?
Justice Khan, who had headed the apex court?s implementation bench announced that the larger bench had unanimously deemed PM Sharif unfit for holding office and would also order an accountability court to open references against him and his family. ?
The judges ruled that he had been dishonest to parliament and the courts, and could not be deemed fit for his office. ?

How JR was forced to sign the Indo -Lanka Accord 30 years ago
?
Thirty years ago on this day (July 29th 1987) an accord was signed by Rajiv Gandhi and Junius Richard Jayewardene
	The India - Sri Lanka Accord known popularly as the Indo-Lanka peace accord was hailed then as a great breakthrough in relations between India and Sri Lanka. ?
	Jayewardene foresaw a potential threat from India after both countries attained freedom from the British.
	In short there were three basic reasons for Indian intervention in Sri Lanka then.
	The immediate consequence was the accord. Yet, later events proved that JR had only ?stooped to conquer?.
	So, food parcels were dropped in what was essentially a ?demonstration effect? device.?
	President JR Jayewardene realised what was in store if he failed to toe the ?Lakshmana Rekha? being drawn by India. So he ?bowed? to the big neighbour.

By D.B.S. Jeyaraj
Thirty years ago on this day (July 29th 1987) an accord was signed by the then Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi and Junius Richard Jayewardene the then President of Sri Lanka in Colombo that had far reaching implications for both the tear drop island in the Indian Ocean and its giant neighbour.?
The India - Sri Lanka Accord known popularly as the Indo-Lanka peace accord was hailed then as a great breakthrough in relations between India and Sri Lanka. Two related letters known as ?annexures? were also signed by both leaders.
The preamble of the accord reads as follows ??
?The President of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka, his Excellency Mr. J.R. Jayewardene, and the Prime Minister of The Republic of India, His Excellency Mr. Rajiv Gandhi, having met at Colombo on July 29, 1987?.
?Attaching utmost importance to nurturing, intensifying and strengthening the traditional friendship of Sri Lanka and India, and acknowledging the imperative need of resolving the ethnic problem of Sri Lanka, and the consequent violence, and for the safety, wellbeing and prosperity of people belonging to all communities of Sri Lanka. Have this day entered into the following agreement to fulfil this objective?.
In realistic terms the accord of July 29th 1987 was a triumph for Indian coercive diplomacy. It was opposed by (and still is) significant sections of the Sri Lankan people.?
A flashpoint indicative of the simmering tension that prevailed then was the attempted assault of the visiting Indian premier by a Sri Lankan naval rating Vijaya Rohana de Silva Wijemuni. The Naval Rating, who was part of the Navy Guard of Honour being inspected by Rajiv Gandhi, took a swipe with his rifle at the Indian Premier?s head.
Mercifully Rajiv saw the swinging rifle from the corner of his eye. He sidestepped deftly and ducked swiftly.?
Instead of reaching out to the affected victims of the July 1983 pogrom and alleviating their hardship the JR regime was hell bent on appeasing the majority. Blaming the Victim syndrome was seen at its best then.
?
The firearm struck his shoulder. Had that blow been fatal, Indo-Lanka relations may have changed drastically in favour of the Sri Lankan Tamil people. However, the very same Rajiv Gandhi who survived the ?Sinhala? assault in 1987 could not escape death when a Sri Lankan Tamil girl known by the nom de guerre ?Dhanu? with explosives strapped to her body blew herself up at a place in Tamil Nadu called Sriperumbudoor in 1991.
The political pendulum in India swung sharply against the Sri Lankan Tamils thereafter.
?
Indian High Commissioner Jyotindra Nath Dixit
Foremost among the many architects of the accord was former Indian High Commissioner in Colombo Jyotindra Nath Dixit known as ?Mani? Dixit. Twenty months after the signing of the accord J.N. Dixit delivered a lecture on Sri Lanka at the United Services Institution in New Delhi on March 10, 1989. Dixit summed up the rationale for exercising Indian ?power? immorally to coerce Sri Lanka into signing the accord thus - ?The chemistry of power, the motivations which affect the interplay of power between societies are not governed by absolute morality. ......?It is an external projection of our influence to tell our neighbours that if, because of your compulsions or your aberrations (sic.), you pose a threat to us, we are capable of, or we have a political will to project ourselves within your territorial jurisdiction for the limited purpose of bringing you back.?
?Sounds slightly arrogant! It is not arrogant. It is real-politik, and it brings you back to the path of detachment and non-alignment where you don?t endanger our security.?
The irony in all this was that the signatory on the Sri Lankan side was President J. R. Jayewardene. JR as he was popularly known was steeped in historical knowledge being an avid reader of history books. He had the uncanny ability at times to predict the future course of events in International relations. JR was concerned about the position of Sri Lanka (then Ceylon) vis-a-vis India ( pre-partition) after the British granted independence. The writing was on the wall for the British Empire even as the second World War was raging.?
Jayewardene foresaw a potential threat from India after both countries attained freedom from the British.
JR Jayewardene along with Dudley Senanayake had been elected Joint Secretaries of the Ceylon National Congress in 1940. In this capacity JR interacted with several leaders of the Indian National Congress. One of them was Jawaharlal Nehru who went on to become Independent India?s first Prime Minister in 1947. Nehru who served as Premier till 1964 was the father of Indira Gandhi, Grandfather of Rajiv Gandhi and Great -grandfather of Rahul Gandhi.
On July 20, 1940, JR Jayewardene wrote to Jawaharlal Nehru: ?Events are moving with such rapidity in the world today that a slave India and Ceylon may be free tomorrow, without a struggle. What of Ceylon? If nothing else happens, is it possible that she may be bartered away by a peace treaty? This is a question that is troubling many of us in Ceylon.??
?
Nehru replied on August 1, 1940:?
?Ceylon is too small a political and economic unit to stand by itself in the future world. I quite agree with you that there might be danger ahead for Ceylon under these circumstances. It will therefore be highly desirable to discuss the future relations of India and Ceylon, so that our minds may be clear and we should know what we are aiming at.?
?
?Monroe Doctrine? of USA in the Indian Ocean
Even if JR?s worries may have been laid to rest by Nehru?s reply at that time, post - independence course of events evoked fresh doubts and misgivings. In 1954 JR was Minister for Agriculture and Food in the Govt. of Prime minister Sir John Kotelawela. The South Asian Prime Ministers? Conference was held in Colombo that year. On March 19, 1954 Jayewardene sent a memorandum to his Prime Minister. In that he alluded to the Monroe doctrine of the USA and emphasised that India should not be allowed to play a similar role in the Indian Ocean region.
?
JR wrote:?
?If we look again at the American scene, we see that the U.S.A. so long ago as 1823 enunciated the Monroe Doctrine and exercised supervision over the entirety of the American Continents, both North and South. It is therefore necessary to see that the states in this region are not cut off from the rest of the world from economic or military aid, such as Pakistan has recently secured from America. India should not be permitted to proclaim a ?Monroe Doctrine? in the Indian Ocean where she will play the role that the U.S.A. plays in the Atlantic.?
Yet, through a quirk of fate the very same JR Jayewardene, who foresaw the potential danger of Indian domination decades ago and was keen on preventing it, happened to be the Sri Lankan leader who bowed down to New Delhi and accepted Indian overlord-ship by way of the accord and annexures in 1987.
Tamil National Alliance (TNA) Spokesperson and Jaffna District parliamentarian M. A. Sumanthiran in a recent article in ?The Hindu? observes thus ??
?The Indo-Sri Lanka Accord itself was unique in that it was a bilateral international agreement between two sovereign nations, where one promised the other that an internal political rearrangement would be made in order to solve the Tamil national question. It was indeed ironic that a President (Jayewardene) who popularised and deified the concept of ?unity, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Sri Lanka? assured the neighbour as to how he would solve an ?internal? political question and then invited the Indian Army into Sri Lanka to help implement the accord?.
What then led to this perceived ?downfall? on the part of Junius Richard Jayewardene? Why did the man who as a Cabinet Minister wanted to resist Indian supremacy in 1954 do an about turn in 1987 as Executive President and cave into Indian demands??
The course of events that led to this transition or transformation is a remarkable political tale by itself.
?
?Intermestic? Term Coined by Henry Kissinger
The ?Tamil issue? is for Sri Lanka and India is an ?intermestic? issue. The term ?Intermestic? was first coined and used by Henry Kissinger to explain international issues having domestic economic implications like for instance the middle-eastern situation abroad impacting on the price of gas in the US. The term coined by Kissinger took the ?inter? from International and ?mestic? from Domestic.
It was however veteran Journalist and foreign affairs expert Mervyn de Silva who popularised the term in Sri Lanka.?
?
The fundamental difference in New Delhi policy towards Pakistan in 1971 and Sri Lanka in 1987 was that in the case of the former it suited Indian interests to fracture Pakistan and create Bangladesh while in the case of the latter, Indian interests were better served by preventing dismemberment of Sri Lanka and unifying the Island by preventing the creation of ?Tamil Eelam?.
?
Mervyn was then editing the ?Lanka Guardian? fortnightly and writing a weekly column for ?Sunday Island?.?
Mervyn applied the term to all issues crossing the boundaries between the International and the domestic and belonged to both spheres thereby necessitating this sub-category.
According to Mervyn, Sri Lanka?s Tamil issue was for Sri Lanka a domestic issue with an international spillover and for India it was an international issue with a domestic spillover. Hence for both Colombo and New Delhi it should be regarded as INTERMESTIC, i.e. ?at the interface of the international and the domestic?.
Generally countries act in their own self ? interest but often attribute lofty motives for such actions .Indian involvement in the affairs of its neighbours has been described as benign intervention by Indian academics and analysts.?
The undermining of the Rana family and empowerment of the Shah dynasty in Nepal, the dismemberment of Pakistan and creation of Bangladesh, the Indo-Lanka accord and induction of the Indian Army as a peace-keeping force in Sri Lanka and the quick action in Maldives to crush a coup d?etat aided by Sri Lankan Tamil militants of the PLOTE (Peoples Liberation Organization of Tamil Eelam ) are some instances of Indian benign intervention.
?
?Benign Interventions? Served India?s Interests
Needless to say all these cases of ?benign intervention? also served India?s interests in the region. But such is the nature of international relations. All countries have their own interests at heart and smaller entities identifying common interests with larger interests and harmonising accordingly have greater chances of bettering the prospects for themselves.
In the case of Sri Lanka the twin tenets of basic Indian policy was preserving the unity and territorial integrity of Sri Lanka on the one hand and ensuring the rights of the minorities particularly the Sri Lankan Tamils on the other. This framework in essence was conditioned by the intermestic factor.
The 1983 July anti-Tamil pogrom saw more than 100,000 Tamils fleeing to Tamil Nadu as refugees. The presence of Tamil refugees on Indian soil was the ?locus standi? for India to seek a greater role in Sri Lanka. Instead of reaching out to the affected victims of the July 1983 pogrom and alleviating their hardship the JR Jayewardene regime was hell bent on appeasing the majority. Blaming the Victim syndrome was seen at its best then.
The Govt. introduced the Sixth Amendment to the Constitution disavowing separatism. All MPs were required to take an oath to that effect to retain Parliamentary membership. The Tamil United Liberation Front (TULF) with sixteen MPs in Parliament refused to take the oath on a matter of principle.?
As a result they forfeited their seats. The Sri Lankan Tamil voice was effectively driven away from Parliament.
?
Ex- TULF MP?s Took Up Residence in Tamil Nadu
Several ex-TULF MP?s including Opposition leader Appapillai Amirthalingam took up residence in Tamil Nadu. With more than a hundred thousand refugees on its soil providing a ?locus standi?, New Delhi offered its good offices to mediate and bring about a negotiated political settlement.
There was an imperative need for India to intervene at that stage. The Sri Lankan Tamil issue was a crucial emotional issue for Tamil Nadu at that time. There was a fear that the mood may turn volatile and result in a law and order crisis. Also there had been a flourishing secessionist movement in Tamil Nadu at one time. It had been checked and transformed democratically. The former Tamil separatists were well integrated into the Indian fabric.?
Now there was apprehension that the fabric may be torn and separatist tendencies revived because of the Sri Lankan Tamil crisis impacting on Tamil Nadu.
If secession was encouraged in Sri Lanka that could have a demonstration effect on other states including Tamil Nadu in India. If the Tamils were allowed to be continually victimised in Sri Lanka that too could radicalise Tamil Nadu in the long term . These parameters necessitated in India fashioning policy ensuring both the unity of Sri Lanka as well as Tamil rights.
?
Creating Bangla Desh and Preventing ?Tamil Eelam?.
The fundamental difference in New Delhi policy towards Pakistan in 1971 and Sri Lanka in 1987 was that in the case of the former it suited Indian interests to fracture Pakistan and create Bangladesh while in the case of the latter, Indian interests were better served by preventing dismemberment of Sri Lanka and unifying the Island by preventing the creation of ?Tamil Eelam?.
The intermestic nature of the issue had two additional aspects too. One was that New Delhi at that time feared an arc of encirclement by ?hostile? forces. India feared a Washington-Tel Aviv- Islamabad axis. The Jayewardene Govt was seen as a Western puppet and lackey (after all JR had been nicknamed ?Yankee Dickie? at one time).?
It was necessary therefore to win over Colombo and bring Sri Lanka within the Indian orbit. The Tamil issue provided an opportunity to de-stabilise Sri Lanka and pressure Jayewardene into submitting to Delhi diktat.
In short there were three basic reasons for Indian intervention in Sri Lanka then.
Firstly the Jayewardene Govt was spurning ?non ? alignment? and taking Sri Lanka into a pro ? Western orbit. Under prevailing conditions of the day New Delhi feared a Washington ? Tel Aviv ? Islamabad axis. India needed to bring Sri Lanka to ?heel? and keep out undesirable elements out of the region.
Secondly there was the domestic imperative. There was much concern in Tamil Nadu for the plight of Tamils in Sri Lanka. Tamil Nadu was once home to a flourishing separatist movement. India was concerned about the fall ? out from Sri Lanka on Tamil Nadu if the conflict escalated here.
The third was the unacknowledged personality factor. It is a fact that basic policy is formulated by the bureaucracy in India and that the political executive is guided by it. Individual leaders by force of their personality may effect a change in the style of implementation but cannot effectively change the substance of policy.?
What happened here was that Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi was not very fond then of President Jayewardene or Prime Minister Premadasa.
?
Allusion of Cow and Calf to Indira-Sanjay and Sirima-Anura
Indira Gandhi declared emergency in 1975 and imposed iron rule in India. She jailed her political opponents. ?Indira and her son Sanjay Gandhi were accused of being virtual dictators. When elections were held in March 1977 the Congress party that had ruled India from 1947 lost for the first time in 30 years. Both Indira and Sanjay lost in their constituencies of Raebareli and Amethi respectively. In July 1977 elections were held in Sri Lanka. The incumbent Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) Prime Minister and her son Anura Bandaranaike contested in the electorates of Attanagalle and Nuwara-eliya-Maskeliya respectively. The irrepressible Ranasinghe Premadasa made a comparison between India and Sri Lanka at election meetings. He repeated on numerous occasions that just as the cow and calf were booted out by the Indian people, the Sri Lankan voters too would reject the cow and calf here.
The allusion of cow and calf were to Indira-Sanjay and Sirima-Anura.?
Just as the Congress lost in India, the SLFP lost in Sri Lanka but unlike in India the cow and calf won in Lanka.?
?
Once a viable solution was arrived at, the Tamil armed struggle was expected to end. But the Tamils were not to be abandoned entirely.?
?
Indira, however had got to know of Premadasa?s allusions and was not amused. In fact she was angry. Proctor S. Sivasubramaniam, the father of former Kopay MP S. Kathiravetpillai, was a family friend of the Nehru-Gandhi family. In conversation with Mr. Sivasubramaniam, Indira Gandhi expressed her resentment at the UNP and its perceived proximity to Morarji Desai?s Govt.?
On the other hand the TULF by remaining fiercely loyal to Indira during her days of defeat had become closer to her. According to reputed Indian analysts, such as A. G. Noorani ??Indira personalised her foreign policy. Her favourites were Sirimavo Bandaranaike, Sheikh Hasina and Benazir Bhutto. Her bete noires were Zia, the King of Nepal and JR Jayewardene.
?
Triple Factor Confluence in Indo-Lanka Relations
This triple factor confluence in Indo - Lanka relations during the Indira-JR period deemed it necessary that India made a ?benign? intervention in Sri Lanka after Indira Gandhi was premier again in 1980. There was little love lost between the JR and Indira led Govts. The Brahmins of South Block were for an intervention in Sri Lanka for two objectives.
1) To help resolve the ethnic conflict within a united Sri Lanka but in a manner acceptable to Tamils,
2) Make Colombo accept New Delhi?s hegemony over the region and appreciate Indian security concerns and teach the Jayewardene regime a lesson while rewarding the TULF.
It was at this point that the July 1983 pogrom occurred. Thousands of Tamils fled as refugees to India. Indian interests in Sri Lanka were harmed. This provided a ?locus standi? for India to intervene in Sri Lanka. Jayewardene then played into India?s hands by bringing in the 6th Amendment disavowing separatism.?
This effectively disenfranchised the Tamil representatives in Parliament. JR also refused to talk directly to the TULF. This created an opportunity for India to step in and offer its ?good offices? to bring about ethnic reconciliation.
?
India Followed Two-track Sri Lanka Policy
So, Gopalaswamy Parthasarathy became India?s official emissary tasked with evolving political rapprochement. But India followed a two ? track policy. Tamil militant groups were trained and armed and housed on Indian soil. They were allowed to run political cum propaganda offices in Tamil Nadu publicly.
India?s objectives were clear. New Delhi wanted to use the Tamil militants as a cutting edge to destabilise the Jayewardene regime and also exert pressure on Colombo to deliver a political settlement.
Once a viable solution was arrived at, the Tamil armed struggle was expected to end. But the Tamils were not to be abandoned entirely. India would underwrite a political solution and maintain a physical armed presence in North ? East Sri Lanka to protect the Tamils and help implement the political solution.
In such a situation the Indian State trained and armed Tamil militants into guerrilla organizations. The idea was to fight and destabilise the North-Eastern Provinces to a great extent.?
Thereafter the Colombo Govt. would be compelled to turn to Delhi for assistance. That moment would be seized. Tamil Eelam was never on the cards. All this while New Delhi was offering its ?good offices? to bring about a negotiated settlement. In the exercise of this two-track policy, Indian envoys would engage with Lankan leaders and Tamil politicians on the one hand while India backed Tamil militant groups such as the LTTE engaged in violence against the Sri Lankan state on the other.
Meanwhile, Indira Gandhi was assassinated in 1984 and her son Rajiv Gandhi succeeded her. Rajiv?s ascendancy saw the veteran Gopalaswamy Parthasarathy being ousted as India?s special envoy to Sri Lanka on the Tamil issue.?
Foreign Secretary Romesh Bhandari functioned as emissary. He was followed by others such as P. Chidambaram, K. Natwar Singh and Rajah Dinesh Singh.?
Foreign Secretaries too changed from Bhandari to Venkateswaran and then K.P. S. Menon. Despite these changes the basic continuity in Indian policy towards Sri Lanka remained.
Dixit Warned Jayewardene of ?Unpredictable Consequences?.
There were many twists and turns but India?s strategy worked to a great extent for some time. But after the military operation in Vadamaratchy in May 1987 it appeared that Colombo was on the verge of wiping out the LTTE. At that point India demonstrated very clearly to Colombo that it would not be allowed to crush Tamil militancy. Indian High Commissioner J. N. Dixit met President Jayewardene and warned him of ?unpredictable consequences?. Dixit writes about the meeting in his ?Assignment Colombo? book in the following manner-
?In one of my meetings with President Jayewardene late in May 1987, I protested against the blockade of Jaffna and the impact of Sri Lankan military operations on Tamil civilians of the area. I informed Jayewardene of my discussions with Lalith Athulathmudali wherein I had conveyed the message that India would not countenance the fall of Jaffna to Sri Lankan forces when India was still engaged in mediation efforts. I reminded Jayewardene that Rajiv Gandhi?s messages to him were a clear indication that India would be compelled to take action to protect Tamil civilians. Jayewardene was quite upset and he described my remarks as interference in the domestic affairs. ?............
?Jayewardene was not going to allow matters to rest in such obfuscations!?
He said:?
?Dixit, be precise. Tell me what you personally think will happen when you talk about ?unpredictable consequences?.? I said: ?You will forgive me for saying this Mr. President, the unpredictable consequences may be LTTE asking operational support from Tamil Nadu and it might end up with the break-up of Sri Lanka. Sri Lanka may not remain a united country.??
?Jayewardene looked at me in his typical droopy-eyed irritation and said: ?Mr Dixit, we are a small country, but I want you to know that I will not succumb to terrorist violence regardless of what you are saying. And please also note that this violence has been and is being supported by your Government and your country.?
?
Mr Dixit, we are a small country, but I want you to know that I will not succumb to terrorist violence regardless of what you are saying.
?
?Shock and Awe? Operation to Intimidate Sri Lanka
Despite the bullying by Dixit, President Jayewardene continued to remain defiant but New Delhi performed a ?shock and Awe? operation to intimidate Sri Lanka and its President further.?
On June 4, 1987 India informed Sri Lanka of its decision to drop relief supplies over Jaffna. Bernard Tilekaratna, Sri Lanka?s High Commissioner to India at that time, recalled his personal experience in an article in The Island of December 10, 1997. Tilekaratna wrote as follows - ?The President had offered to send Foreign Minister Hameed to discuss the developing crisis but India had already decided to send its Air Force planes not only five Antonov-22 transport planes but also four Mirage-2000 fighter planes, to escort them.?
?I had enough contacts in New Delhi to know that this move was planned some days in advance even though it was done in complete secrecy and no details were known. My information was that this would take place by air or through Indian warships and I had conveyed this to the President himself. When I was summoned to the Ministry of External Affairs by the then Minister of State for External Affairs, Natwar Singh, who was also a personal friend, and told rather grimly at 2.30 p.m. on 4 June that the aircraft would leave Bangalore in half an hour. My reaction was one of both anguish and sadness. I informed Natwar Singh that surely the proposed air-drop was a blatant violation of our territorial integrity and interference in our internal affairs and I was saddened by the fact that this step would bring Indo-Sri Lanka relations to the lowest level ever in the long history of its close and cordial relationship?.
?
Bernard Tilekaratna Hands Over Letter of Protest
?As regards conveying the message to the President, I told Natwar Singh the planes might as well leave as scheduled as it would take me half an hour to reach the Chancery and try to send the message. It was at this point that Natwar Singh offered me his personal hotline through to the Foreign Minister and his surprise was so great that it was my impression that this news was received for the first time. In fact I was asked to immediately hand over a letter of protest which I did in the Minister?s office itself before I returned to the Chancery.?
What Bernard Tilekaratna refers to is of course the infamous air drop operation by India over Jaffna . On June 4th 1987 the Indian Air Force conducted ?Operation Poomalai? ?by which food parcels were dropped over Jaffna in what was described as a humanitarian exercise. It was a blatant violation of Sri Lankan air space. This was in the aftermath of ?Operation Liberation? in Vadamaratchy and India claimed overt concern then about starvation in Jaffna. Actually no one was starving in Jaffna then. The whole exercise, beneath the humanitarian facade, was a power projection, intended to drive home a lesson to Colombo.
?
JR and the ?Lakshmana Rekha? Drawn by India
The real situation in Jaffna was distorted to convey an impression that there was starvation warranting the drastic action of violating Lankan air space. So, food parcels were dropped in what was essentially a ?demonstration effect? device. President JR Jayewardene realised what was in store if he failed to toe the ?Lakshmana Rekha? being drawn by India. So he ?bowed? to the big neighbour.
The immediate consequence was the accord. Yet, later events proved that JR had only ?stooped to conquer?.?

US Senate rejects President Trump?s attempt to overhaul Obamacare
	
On a day that promised to be long cots were delivered Thursday to senators? hideaways just off the Senate floor before votes on the health-care bill. (Washington Post/Melina Mara)?
?
?By Juliet Eilperin, Kelsey Snell, Sean Sullivan ? ??
(c) 2017, The Washington Post ? Jul 28, 2017 - WASHINGTON -- Senate Republicans suffered a dramatic failure early Friday in their bid to advance a scaled-back plan to overhaul the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare), throwing into question whether they can actually repeal the 2010 health law. ??
Their latest effort to redraw the ACA failed after Sen. John McCain?s decision to side with a couple other Republicans against President Trump and GOP leaders. The Arizona Republican, diagnosed with brain cancer last week, returned to Washington Tuesday and delivered a stirring address calling for a bipartisan approach to overhauling the ACA, a process that may have compelled McCain to cast his rebellious vote. ??
The vote was 49 to 51. ??
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., had hoped to approve the new, narrower rewrite of the health law at some point Friday, after facing dozens amendments from Democrats. But the GOP defections left McConnell without a clear bill to push. ??

Venezuela crisis tips into showdown
	
CARACAS AFP July28, 2017- Venezuela careened towards a showdown on its streets Friday between anti-government protesters and security forces, raising international alarm at worsening deadly unrest and prompting the United States to order the families of embassy staff out. ??
The opposition called fresh nationwide demonstrations to defy a new government ban on rallies ahead of a controversial vote Sunday to elect a body to rewrite the constitution. ??
Four months of protests against unpopular leftist President Nicolas Maduro have already claimed 112 lives, according to prosecutors --seven of them during a two-day general strike that ended Thursday. ??
Tensions have been heightened by a decree from Maduro banning protests and warning that anyone who marches against the ?Constituent Assembly? risks up to 10 years in prison. ??
The opposition coalition, shot back with a tweet saying ?the regime declared we can?t demonstrate... We will respond with the TAKING OF VENEZUELA.? ?
