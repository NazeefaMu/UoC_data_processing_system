H?tota IPZ was former regime?s plan: Ranil
	
The industrial zone in Hambantota was originally planned by the previous regime led by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said on Saturday.
Speaking during the inauguration of the Southern Industrial Zone, the Prime Minister said the present government was also following the former regime in setting up the zone.
" The previous regime actually got into an agreement to set up the zone in 2014," he said
Further he said that a committee headed by Law and Order Minister Sagala Ratnayake and Former Speaker Chamal Rajapaksa had been appointed to find suitable land for the zone.
?I thank Mr. Rajapaksa for his cooperation with the government in finding lands for the zone," he said.
He said if the government had decided against going for an agreement with China or a joint venture to swap against the loans given by Exim Bank it would be been necessary to increase VAT further.
?Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake suggested us that VAT would have to be increased or the Port has to be sold out but we finally decided to go for a Joint Venture," he said.
" We would have loved to keep a 40 percent or 51 percent stake of the port but that could not be done as we would have had to increase the VAT to generate funds to pay the loan this year," he added while revealing that more than Rs. 1 billion was to be paid this year.
Chinese Ambassador Yi Xianliang said Chinese investors would always give priority to Sri Lanka.
He said a China-Sri Lanka bilateral relation was a role model for all bilateral relations in the world.
"We have investments in India, the US and number of other countries but we give priority to Sri Lanka," he said.
He then requested the Chinese investors to take care of the environment when running their industries.(By Yohan Perera)

## Title: India opposes SL?s bid to shape ETCA to suit political exigencies

India opposes SL?s bid to shape ETCA to suit political exigencies
	
Negotiations between India and Sri Lanka on an Economic and Technical Cooperation Agreement (ETCA) hit the hard road at an official?s-level meeting held in Colombo on January 4 and 5, Indian Express reported.
Informed sources told Express that the Sri Lankan side was pressing the Indians to make certain concessions explicitly to enable it sell the pact to the Sri Lankan masses who tend to imagine that ETCA would be a rank give away to the Big Brother across the Palk Strait.
The Indian side resisted these moves on the grounds that trade pacts are too serious, too far reaching and wide-ranging in their impact to be tailored to suit short-term political requirements.
However, the Sri Lankan side had good reasons to pursue a political goal.? Even as the talks were on in the city, posters against ETCA, describing it as ?aggression?, appeared in parts of Central Colombo. At any rate the Sinhalese language slogan ?ETCA EPA? (No to ETCA) has caught the imagination of the people.
With the opposition, led by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, backing the anti-ETCA campaign, the pact is expected to be an issue in the forthcoming local bodies and provincial elections scheduled for June-July and September respectively, unless it is tailored to suit the electoral agenda of the ruling coalition.
But tailoring it to an electoral agenda might mean India?s giving in to Sri Lanka in ways which could adversely affect the interests of its own private sector. This aspect has to be borne in mind as the primary driving force in the liberalized Indian economy is the private sector.
There were differences over priorities. The Sri Lankan side lay great stress on correcting the flaws or removing the irritants in the Free Trade Agreement (FTA) which became operational in 2000. The Sri Lankan side has been seeking the removal of a plethora of Non Tariff Barriers (NBTs) which impede the entry of Sri Lankan goods into the Indian market. Sri Lankans feel that if the NTBs are not there, the trade gap would not be as big as it is now.
But the Indians have had difficulty in removing many of the NTBs. Or, as the Sri Lankans allege, they have been tardy and reluctant.
At any? rate, Indians think that pegging the signing of ETCA to removing the flaws in the FTA is neither warranted nor practical because the two are different kettles of fish. FTA is about trade in goods while ETCA is about investment, services and economic cooperation. It is to be a re-designed??? reincarnation of the now abandoned Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement (CEPA).
At official level trade talks, the minutiae tend to get a lot of attention. Discussions take place over every sentence and paragraph and the order in which they are written. It is said that the Sri Lankans wanted some things to be stated not only in the introductory statement but also in the main body of the agreement as a clause which the Indians resisted.
Above all, there were differences over the time period to end the negotiations and sign the pact. Not having been able to sign it by December 2016 to time with the second anniversary of the Sirisena regime, the Sri Lankans wanted the talks to be wrapped up fast by mid 2017 before the local bodies and provincial elections. But the Indians would not be hustled as trade talks are complicated affairs and take years to conclude internationally.
India was not averse to holding meetings often, say once in a month, but it was against rushing through as both sides have vital interests to be safeguarded or pursued. As the Indian Commerce Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said? during her visit to Colombo last year, both India and Sri Lanka have concerns, interests and issues to address, and that India is not in favor having a strict timeframe to wrap up the talks.
While no date was fixed for the next round of talks, it is likely that the next round could be held in February.(Indian Express)

SL to urge UN to declare Vesak as full UN holiday
	
President Maithripala Sirisena is to submit a proposal to the International Buddhist Seminar-a segment at the 2017 UN Vesak Day celebrations to be held in Sri Lanka- to declare Vesak Day as a fully-fledged UN holiday, Parliamentary reforms and Media Ministry Secretary Nimal Bopage said today.
The 193-member UN General Assembly in 1999 declared an ?International Day of Observance for Vesak? on the initiative of the then Foreign Minister Lakshman Kadirgamar.
UN Vesak Day celebrations would be held in Sri Lanka on May 12 to 14 this year with the participation of more than 1,000 delegates representing all Buddhist countries around the world, Bopage stated when he visited the Mahanayake of the Malwatte and Asgiriya Chapters at the respective Temples in Kandy.
Respecting the diverse religious affiliations of UN staffers, the General Assembly unanimously adopted a resolution in January last year recognising seven new UN ?floating holidays?, including Vesak, Orthodox Good Friday, Yom Kippur and Diwali.
According to the resolution, staff members should inform their supervisors in advance, as early in the year as possible, of the floating holiday they wish to observe.( Nadeeka Daya Bandara)

Unity Govt. will serve full term -- President
	
President Maitripala Sirisena, in his second year anniversary speech, asserted that the current national unity government would serve its full term, and said anyone interested in nation building should join hands with it.
He said some politicians who had been rejected by the people were talking about elections, but the elections would only be conducted in another four years' time. Therefore, he said there should not be any doubts about the government.
Addressing the ?National Convention? held this afternoon at the BMICH to mark the completion of two years since his victory at the Presidential Election, President Sirisena said the Presidential election was held in 2015 as the Mahinda Rajapaksa government could not face the aggressive attitude of the international community towards it and the impending economic crisis.
