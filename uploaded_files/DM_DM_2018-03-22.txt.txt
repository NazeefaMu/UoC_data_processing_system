Cambridge Analytica CEO claims influence on US election
	

The suspended chief executive of Cambridge Analytica said in a secretly recorded video broadcast on Tuesday that his UK-based political consultancys online campaign played a decisive role in U.S. President Donald Trumps 2016 election victory.
CEO Alexander Nixs comments, which could not be verified, are potentially a further problem for Facebook Inc as it faces lawmakers scrutiny in the United States and Europe over Cambridge Analyticas improper use of 50 million Facebook users personal data to target voters.
The social media networks shares fell for a second day, closing down 2.5 percent, as investors worried that its dealings with Cambridge Analytica might damage its reputation, deter advertisers and invite restrictive regulation. The company has lost $60 billion of its stock market value over the last two days. Cambridge Analyticas board of directors suspended Nix on Tuesday, shortly before the second part of British broadcaster Channel 4s expose of the firms methods.
In the programme Nix describes questionable practices used to influence foreign elections and said his firm did all the research, analytics and targeting of voters for Trumps digital and TV campaigns. He also boasts he met Trump when he was the Republican presidential candidate many times. Nixs comments do not represent the values or operations of the firm and his suspension reflects the seriousness with which we view this violation, Cambridge Analytica said in a statement on Tuesday.

Cant accept all UNHRC recommendations: SF
	
Minister of Regional Development Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka yesterday said that all the recommendations made by the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) in Geneva cannot be accepted as not all the charges were true.
He said some charges were exaggerated and were made after the war based on the agendas of a few to sling mud at the country. There could be exceptions but we are not ready to blindly accept all the allegations brought against the country, he said.
The Minister said the Rajapaksa administration had aggravated the issue when the war crime claims were first made. "Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa and his brother, then Defence Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksas offensive behaviour aggravated the issue further," he said. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

Fraud suspect Wijenayake in President's delegation of Japan visit: JVP
	
JVP MP Bimal Ratnayake said today former MP Piyasiri Wijenayake, who was held responsible for fraud by PRECIFAC, had accompanied the President on his recent visit to Japan and said this would negatively influence the legal proceedings against him.
He asked in parliament how the President took him on a state visit when he was accused of a fraud by a commission.
"Mr. Wijenayake was seen attending a discussion between the President and the Japanese Prime Minister. How is the law enforced on such suspects when they are taken on state visits like this. I ask the Law and Order minister to inform parliament whether this would unduly influence the judiciary and the police," Mr. Ratnayake asked.
He said PRECIFAC had held about 200 people responsible for fraud and corruption. (Ajith Siriwardana and Yohan Perera)

Govt. compelled to give poison if people ask for it:  Harrison
	
We would be compelled to provide them with poisonous synthetic fertilizer as a Government if the people demand so to increase their harvests, Rural Economic Affairs Minister P Harrison said.
Addressing an event in Thalawa Divisional Secretariat the minister said the Government took a decision to reduce the usage of synthetic fertilizer as a solution to the kidney disease and to direct the farmers on organic fertilizer.
However, he said at the recently held Local Government Election the people had given a message to the Government to provide the synthetic fertilizer which causes kidney diseases instead of the organic fertilizer.
Nearly 100,000 people affected with kidney disease due to glyphosate. Yet the people taught us a lesson that they want it and will not vote for us if not. Therefore we had decided to give synthetic fertilizer from next Yala Season for Rs 500, he said.
He further said that as the government it was helpless as the people oppose any action initiated for their own safety. (Dayaratne Abogama)

Hindu priest killing: Soldier, 3 others sentenced to death
	
A soldier and three others accused of killing a Hindu priest in Murugumoorthi Sankanai, Jaffna on April 11, 2010, and severely injuring another were convicted and sentenced to death yesterday (22) by Jaffna High Court Judge Manikkavasagar Illanchelian.
The three who were convicted were identified as Pedurusingha Gunasena, K. Muhundan alias Shakthi and Balasubramaniam Shivaruban of Jaffna
The Judge stated that after a lengthy trial the prosecution had been able to prove their case beyond a shadow of a doubt. Accordingly, he ordered that the three who were convicted be hung on a date to be determined by the President.
The murder of the chief priest of the Hindu Kovil S. Sivanathan at Murugamoorthy Road Sankanai in Jaffna was proved to have been carried out by these three convicts using automatic firearms. His two sons had also been injured in the shooting. The killers had also got away with Rs.50,000 and a motorcycle.
Manipay Police had launched investigations into the killing while the army had also launched an investigation into the incident given the fact that a soldier was one of those accused.
The judge also sentence all three to 20 years imprisonment for robbery and assault. (Sithum Chathuranga)

Intriguing K.A.W. Perera And the roads he took us through
	
Thats the road the man took us through. It is a road that has been stalled midway, in the name of the art house. And a road we need to return to. Right now
Trash doesnt belong to the academic tradition, and thats part of the fun of trashyou know (or should know) that you dont have to take it seriously, that it was never meant to be anymore than frivolous and trifling and entertaining. (Pauline Kael)
The man triumphed, I think: in his ability to make us forget everything that preceded what we were seeing
	Directors like Perera come out of a certain milieu
	Pereras movies never had such plots: where they promised to parse and get together logically was exactly where they detoured
From his debut to his finale, K. A. W. Perera lived for nearly 45 years and gave us more than 25 films.
None of them impressed critics, and none of them were meant to, but they enraptured audiences and made them come back for more in ways no other filmmaker could hope to match.
I have a neighbour who swears by the artifice of Janaka saha Manju, and her son, a close friend of mine, makes it a point to tell me that it always moves him and her to tears.
I tried for a long time to cry at Janaka saha Manju; I found out that I could not, and I found out that in certain sequences I would burst out laughing.
One way to equate the work that came out of this social subset is by equating it to kitsch, or trashy art
But thats where the catch was: even in the most banally conceived scenes, Perera targeted a specific subset in our society who had been missed out by other mainstream filmmakers, and along the way transformed the unreality of his stories to the tears, laughs, and sobs and smiles he compelledfrom them.
Theres something about an artist like K. A. W. Perera that intrigues me. Their awareness of the shortcomings of their own craft  the inept performances, the crude scripts, the bizarre finales and culminations and revelations  is more often than not compensated for by their urge to tell a story that enchants. Nothing sustains interest in a filmgoer, after all, than a plot that parses.
But Pereras movies never had such plots: where they promised to parse and get together logically was exactly where they detoured, and sometimes wildly, to subplots and storylines that neither made sense nor were really essential to the larger narrative.
Janaka saha Manju is, in that respect, not really about Janaka and Manju, rather a ton of other stories and subplots that somehow keep us entertained in the crudest way possible.
But thats where the man triumphed, I think: in his ability to make us forget everything that preceded what we were seeing and everything that followed what we just saw.
Directors like Perera come out of a certain milieu, and Perera fitted that milieu perfectly. One way to equate the work that came out of this social subset is by equating it to kitsch, or trashy art, the sort that fulfilled the most rudimentary function of any art: keep audiences fixed to their seats. The man who gave us Janaka saha Manju never intrigued us, nor was he a born craftsman, but he was a teller or tales, and our society, even more than neighbouring societies, was filled with the milieu he happened to come from, which happened to be the same milieu that demanded, more than anything else, that what they were watching, reading, and listening to was basically first and foremost a story.
So what of hisown story
Koddul Arachchige Perera was born in 1915 in Colombo. His mother, Kavinihamy Ratnayake, privileged his education so much that she got him admitted to Ananda College, back then a repository of Buddhist education. Ananda wasnt far off, but nor was it nearby, so young Perera had to go by bus every day and spend 25 cents on the ride.
From an early age, however, he was an ardent consumer of bioscope, the peepshow, which meant that he had to save money for the occasional jaunt to the theatre. His parents didnt really approve of this, and werent ready to give him pocket money for the purpose, so he eventually struck a plan: he would go to school by foot, saving the 25 cents in such a way that he would be able to spend the fare on movie tickets.
Owing to his mothers strictness, however, he did not neglect his studies: in the end, he passed the Junior School Certificate. What happened next could have come out straight from one of his films: while studying at a private institute to prepare himself for the University Entrance Examination, he met a girl called Agnes whom he befriended and became a lover of, the problem being that the romance was never sanctioned by his parents. Since he disobeyed them and went ahead, and since they cut him off from the family, he had to face a dwindling financial situation which he tried to evade by finding a job through the Employment Exchange. On his first attempt, however, he was rejected; on his way back home, he was called to the Exchange by an official who had happened to be one of his teachers at Ananda. Eventually, he was hired as a clerk at the Education Department.
Ananda had given him a sound knowledge of the local arts, including the local theatre. Perera had quickly become a lover of drama, and while at the Department he wrote scripts for Radio Ceylon. His radio plays soon picked up and became popular with audiences, one of whom happened to be the Director of the Department.
Perusing his qualifications, that Director appointed Perera as an Assistant English Teacher at a school in Biyanwala.
Theres something about an artist like K. A. W. Perera that intrigues me. Their awarenessof the shortcomingsof their own craft
Four years later, though, he was out of the teaching profession and in Radio Ceylon, as a full time writer and copywriter. His penchant for written dialogues which were, for their time, down to earth, got him the attention of Lester James Peries, who, fresh out of the Government Film Unit, recruited him as the dialogues writer for Sri Lankas first genuinely conceived film, Rekava. He later wound up as the dialogues writer for Periess next film, Sandeshaya, after which he co-directed his debut, Pirimiyek Nisa, with T. Somasekaran, in 1960 and under the patronage of E. A. P. Edirisinghe. Senasuma Kothanada, a love story which featured the likes of Gamini Fonseka and Jeevarani Kurukulasuriya and which introduced Premasiri Khemadasa to the world of film music, was an overnight sensation when it was first released in 1966. Naturally enough, Perera waded on unhindered, with Kapatikama, Bicycle Hora, Penawa Neda, Kathuru Muwath, Seeye Nottuwa, Lokuma Hinawa, Ihatha Athmaya, Aparadaya saha Danduwama, and Lasanda.
After Lasanda (in 1975), he gave his most phenomenally successful work: Duleeka, Wasana (Geetha Kumarasinghes debut), Nedeyo (where he introduced Vijaya Nandasiri to the cinema), and of course Janaka saha Manju. They dont come like that anymore. Then again, they never could.
With some of the most telling titles any director here could conjure up (who else, after all, could have gone for such intriguing tags like Bangali Walalu or Wathura Karaththaya today  forget Jungi Hora, which isnt intriguing, only nauseating), he congealed into the most plebeian filmmaker Sri Lanka could claim. That was part of his magic and charm. And in the end, that magic and charm, despised by the critic, won everyone who patronised them, especially on account of the repertory of actors he went for: Upali Attanayake, Sonia Dissanayake, Joe Abeywickrama, and his own son, Jayantha Das Perera.
I talked with Jayantha some time back and I asked him to explain what it was that made up his fathers penchant for the box office.
For one thing, Jayantha replied, He had a way with his actors, more particularly his leading actors: Gamini, Vijaya, Joe, Upali, and Ravindra, to name just five. When I was in Janaka saha Manju, he didnt see me as his son, but as Janaka.
I remember I had to in one scene embrace and kiss Gothami Pathiraja, who played Manju. At that age I suppose I was a little wary of embracing women in such a crude way, because I distinctly remember my father, forgetting all propriety for one moment, shouting at me Dont you know how to kiss a woman No, he wasnt angry there. He was being sardonic. Frank. I think thats what came through his work. And I think thats what grabbed audiences back then. Grab is an understatement. For some time I couldnt understand what it was in Janaka saha Manju which demanded tears, but then it occurred to me: even those who wring their hands and sniff at it understand that the world they look at, the characters resident in it, and the storylines that colour it, are patently false. And yet they cry, not because they are deceiving themselves, but because they know that beneath the fissures of Janaka saha Manju, theres something that goes beyond the unreality of its experience and worldview.
By making us forget that unreality, Perera transformed our disbelief into emotion.
His was a world we were afraid to tread beyond the projector: a world which, like in Woody Allens The Purple Rose of Cairo, we went to observe and would swoon if ever it intruded on ours. In the end that became his magic touch, and he became a Midas: of the rough, unrefined sort perhaps, but a Midas nevertheless. That has got to be reason why his movies always made money.
When we watch Deveni Inima today, and cringe at the unpredictability and unreality of the plotlines in it, we are guilty of being repressed puritans. When we read Sujeewa Prasanaarachchis novels and cringe at the melodramatic overtones of his romances, again we are guilty. This is not because were pretentiously high-and-mighty, but because we think that the stories which run riot in them dont exist, when in fact they do: Ive come across schoolboys and schoolgirls who deceive half the world, the way the schoolboys and schoolgirls resident in Deveni Inima and Prasanaarachchis novels do, into thinking that they ARENT in love.
When I watch Janaka saha Manju, therefore, my disbelief at the incredulity of its plot is tempered, thankfully, by my realisation that this is what those who flocked in droves to see it back when it was released wanted: a sugar-coated variant on the lives they drew themselves to, which they would do anything to have.
The testosterone-laden adolescents who croon Sanuka Wickramasinghe, watch Deveni Inima, and impress their lovers with their voices, are really no different to the people we saw, and wanted to become, in one of K. A. W. Pereras tearjerkers. Thats the road the man took us through. It is a road that has been stalled midway, in the name of the art house. And a road we need to return to. Right now.

JO covering up sins through no-faith against PM: Akila
	
The joint opposition is attempting to cover up its misdeeds by moving a no-confidence motion against Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, said UNP Deputy General Secretary and Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam.
While vowing to defeat the no-confidence motion, Minister Kariyawasam said the joint opposition was trying to dodge legal action over its past frauds, corruptions and carnage.
The joint opposition is attempting to wash away its sins through the no-confidence motion. UNP MPs will not support this cause. I hope there will never be such brainless people in the UNP. Parliamentarians who are faithful to the UNP and willing to punish the culprits will never support this motion, he said.
The joint opposition yesterday handed over the no-confidence motion, signed by 55 parliamentarians (51 JO and four SLFP MPs), to Speaker Karu Jayasuriya. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)

land-filling damages Muthurajawelas  ecosystem
	
Muthurajawela, a fertile paddy land in the past, was made a protected wetland sanctuary under the Flora and Fauna Protection Act by a gazette notification dated October 31, 1996. This was done in recognition of its vast biodiversity. The internationally acclaimed wetland, located between Colombo and Negombo, is being undermined by unauthorised and illegal human activities. These activities are taking place despite the sanctuary boasting of environmental, economical and regenerative values. 
According to records at the Agrarian Development Department office, there are 635 acres of paddy fields in the Muthurajawela area. Marshlands and mangroves in the area amount to 7000 acres. 
Society of Protecting Muthurajawela Sanctuary, a leading and active environmental society in the areas surrounding Muthurajawela, is keeping a close watch on what is happening in Muthurajawela. 
Society of Protecting Muthurajawela Sanctuary is keeping a close watch on what is happening in Muthurajawela
	The societys president alleged that a top official was also involved in this illegal transaction
	The court issued an order banning garbage dumping, sand mining and land filling within the Muthurajawela Sanctuary
	The departments administrative legal officer said that he hadnt informed the new commissioner about the court case
The leaders in this society in the likes of its president Anil Jayamaha, secretary Senarathna Wanasingha and treasurer Dinusha Nanayakkara spoke to the Daily Mirror regarding the crisis. 
We have handed over a hard copy of the Supreme Court order to Gampaha District office, as well as the Bopitiya  Nugape Agrarian office. Therefore, they cannot say they are unaware of such a case
The leaders of this society alleged that the Agrarian Development Department had received a massive amount of money from a private developer to fill close to 406 acres of fallow fields and start a housing project in the Muthurajawela sanctuary. The lands are in Thuduwa  Bopitya and Kunjawaththa of the Wattala Divisional Secretariat area. This massive sum of money was to be paid in connection with a land area spreading to 65102 perches with each perch valued at 500 rupees. The society leaders said that they had got to know of this deal and prevented the department from continuing with it. 
They said the agreement was also a violation of a Supreme Court order which has temporarily banned landfilling, sand mining, dumping garbage and other illegal activities within the sanctuary. The societys president alleged that a top official at the Gamapaha District Agrarian Development office was also involved in this transaction. According to unofficial sources, this officer has close ties with ministers and top officials. It is also alleged that this assistant commissioner has threatened the district officer for carrying out her duties. 
We have handed over a hard copy of the Supreme Court order to Gampaha District office, as well as the Bopitiya  Nugape Agrarian office. Therefore, they cannot say they are unaware of such a case, the society officials said. 
The society had filed a Fundamental Rights violation case against the illegal activities of landfill, garbage dumping and sand filling in Muthurajawela Sanctuary. In the case SC. FR. No. 176/ 2017 the court issued an order on November 1, 2017 banning garbage dumping, sand mining and land filling within the Muthurajawela Sanctuary. The case has been filed against 11 institutions: Colombo Municipal Council (CMC), Municipal Commissioner, the Urban Development Authority (UDA), the Central Environmental Management Authority (CEA), the Wattala Pradeshiya Sabha, the Commissioner General of Agrarian Development Department, Director General of the Wildlife Conservation Department (DWLC), Director General of the Irrigation Department, Assistant Divisional Secretary of Wattala, the Geological Survey and Mines Bureau (GSMB) and the Attorney General of Sri Lanka. 
Even a paddy farmer has to have permission from the Department of Agrarian Development to do cultivation in Muthurajawela. It (The sanctuary) does not support farmers, but more than half of Agrarian Department owned land has been given to these crooks for landfilling. Jayamaha alleged. 
We are carrying out this fight to save this precious ecosystem regardless of the threats to our lives. We request the Government to do its duty first and then many problems would be solved
Internal miscommunication
We recently met the Agrarian Development Commissioner with representatives from a farmers association and the district officer. The newly appointed Commissioner said he was not aware of the mega deal since he was appointed only on February 20. The departments administrative legal officer, who was also present, confirmed that he had not informed the new commissioner about the court case. The commissioner responded by saying that internal miscommunication appeared to be the cause. The former Commissioner General had got involved in this deal during his final days in office. The payment was allegedly made by February 10, Jayamaha said. 
The society said that it had requested the new commissioner to save Muthurajawela and paddy cultivation was the only option to do this. The new Commissioner General had said that nobody could fill a land even if it was not a paddy land. He had then pledged that he would not allow any fraud. Answering a question as to why these businessmen are interested in filling and owning land in Muthurajawela, the society explained that it was done considering that they (businessmen) were seeking this land because Port City, the highway and other development projects were within close proximity to Colombo. 
They are blind to the harm they are doing to this valuable ecosystem and the destruction caused by these activities to surrounding villages, the society warned. 
The society pointed out that when the land is filled, occurring floods would affect hundreds of thousands of people residing in an around this area, belonging to 35 Grama Seva Divisions including Ja  Ela, Wattala, Kerawalapitiya and many other populated areas surrounding Muthurajawela. 
There are farmers willing to cultivate and the Agriculture Department is encouraging them to cultivate fallow fields. But the circulars do not pass onto the hands of farmers or their organizations due to the activities of corrupt officers. They do not pass the circulars to the farmers. If a farmer starts to cultivate paddy, then this business group buys over the farmers or bribes them, the society alleged. 
Threats to lives
The society leaders said, We are carrying out this fight to save this precious ecosystem regardless of the threats to our lives. We request the Government to do its duty first and then many problems would be solved. Police, local government politicians, ministers and the Government are directly involved in this. The president, who is also the Environment minister, has not uttered a word regarding this matter so far. Unofficial sources are saying that the bond scam money has been used in buying land at Muthurajawela. 
According to the Muthurajawela Master plan, the Department of Wildlife Conservation has been tasked to declare the marsh conservation zone as a sanctuary and to manage it accordingly. 
Acting Director of Department of Wildlife Conservation Manjula Amararathna when contacted said, The Agrarian Development Department has not issued the approval letter yet. We have a meeting on today and it is then only that we will be able to make a proper comment. Anyway, filling at the sanctuary is illegal and if landfilling takes place, such activities should be carried out in keeping with our rules and regulations.

SLLRDC responds
When inquiries were made regarding this incident from Sri Lanka Land Reclamation and Development Corporation (SLLRDC) Chairman Roshan Gunawardane, he made Deputy General Manager of Wetland Management Niamalashantha Wijayarathna speak to us.
I have not seen this letter yet therefore I cant comment on the content. If they are selling the land there should be conditions included in the letter. The normal procedure should be followed and an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) should be done, he said. 
Further explaining the procedure for selling land, he said, If any property contains the names Wela, Kumbura, Deniya, Ovita at the end of its name, the very first letter should be acquired from the Agrarian Department if any person wants to do any development project in these lands (Muthuraja - WELA). Its kind of an unofficial matter. No other Government institution can perform any task without obtaining permission from the Agrarian Development Department. If the department issues land, it is bound to ask for recommendation from related Government institutions. So far we have not been made aware of any matter related to this land selling. 
Answering how they could have performed such a task when there is an order from Supreme Court, he said the question should be asked from the Agrarian Development Department. 
The Daily Mirror was unable to contact the Commissioner General of Agrarian Development Department and his staff said that he was out of Colombo. Members of his staff did not provide us with his contact number. The Assistant Commissioner M. N. L. Sandamali when contacted refused to provide us with information saying, You cannot ask for info without the permission from ministrys secretary. She then told this scribe to contact the Commissioner General.

Legal action to be taken against those who misuse kerosene subsidy
	
The Petroleum Resources Development Ministry today said legal action would be taken against those misusing kerosene subsidies, which was a relief given by the President.
This would be done without considering positions of those involved and against filling stations which violate and misuse the kerosene relief given to them.
Speaking to the media, Minister Arjuna Ranatunga said an artificial increase was shown in the use of kerosene between 2014 and 2017.
About 1,38,505 kilo litres of kerosene had been used in 2014 and it was increased to 1,98,090 kilolitres in 2017, Minister Ranatunga said.
He said one litre of kerosene was selling in the market at a price of Rs.48 as a relief for the people following instructions of the President.
The total loss for kerosene in 2017 was Rs. 5.4 billion and it had been increased by misusing the facility and furthermore the President had instructed to cancel the licence of the filling stations,Minster said. (Chatruranga Samarawickrama)

Misunderstanding the Prophets teaching on violence
	
In the above captioned article by Jonathan Powell, published in the Daily Mirror of the March 10, he quotes verse 29 of Chapter 9 of the Holy Quran, which is often quoted by detractors to support their misunderstood claim that offensive violence is sanctified in Islam. This verse has been explained time and again refuting this baseless claim but that does not stop the detractors.
The verse 9:29 (not correctly quoted by Jonathan Powell) translates as:
Fight against those who believe not in Allah, nor in the Last Day, nor forbid that which has been forbidden by Allah and His Messenger, and those who acknowledge not the religion of truth among the People of the Scripture.
For those who are objective and have an open mind, this verse does NOT sanctify violence as claimed by Powell and his likes. It is a specific command to meet a specific situation and Nothing more
This verse, like many other verses in the Holy Quran, is contextual and a specific command to fight the Byzantine Romans and other hostile powers who were planning an invasion against the Muslims in Arabia. In context, it is a distinct response to aggression, in particular the assassination of one of the Prophets ambassadors who carried a letter to the Christian ruler of Busra.
For those who are objective and have an open mind, this verse does NOT sanctify violence as claimed by Powell and his likes. It is a specific command to meet a specific situation and Nothing more.
It will be quite relevant to examine the situation of the Muslim world during the last 100 years or so. The Muslim Empire - the Ottoman Empire - was disposed of by the West led by Britain during WWI. Not content with that, the West set about the Balkanisation of the Muslim Middle East soon after WWI. In furthering their Hostility towards the Muslims, soon after WWII, the Zionist state of Israel was set up in the middle of the Muslim Middle East by the West. The continuing and unending Brutalities inflicted by Israel on the original inhabitants of Palestine, for Seven Decades, has resulted in the killing of tens of thousands and the eviction of millions of Palestinians from their homes, who have been forced to live a life of misery in squalid refugee camps. The Palestinians in the Occupied West Bank and Gaza (under Blockade since 2007) are subject to vicious oppression with no end in sight for the severe persecution that the Palestinians suffer on a daily basis.
The West extended its animosity towards the Muslims further by the invasion of Afghanistan in 2001 followed by the invasion of Iraq in 2003

The West extended its animosity towards the Muslims further by the invasion of Afghanistan in 2001 followed by the invasion of Iraq in 2003. The Iraqi invasion was justified through Blatant LIES and Vile PROPAGANDA. These invasions resulted in the killing of millions of Afghanis and Iraqis with millions more maimed and wounded and more millions forced out from the comfort of their homes to a wretched life as refugees. These countries have been bombed to Stone Age by the West. Iraq was a rich country with a highly developed infrastructure before the invasion. The stable and wealthy Libya was targeted next by the West in 2011 which resulted in the ouster and cold blooded murder of its leader Gaddafi. The country is reduced to ruins and is in chaos now. It is Syrias turn now with no end in sight.
Getting back to the verse 9:29 which was specifically in relation to the threat from the Western Byzantine Romans, is it so hard to understand its relevance to the Savageous blood bath, humiliation, indignity and unending suffering the Muslim world has been subject to as a result of the ruthless attacks by the West for the past century and continuing There is little doubt that the vicious attacks on the Muslim World by the West is well planned and executed and is unlikely to be halted in the foreseeable future. The only question is, which country will be next and when will the Rapacious West turn its war machine on that country. I trust that your readers will understand the Quranic verse in its correct context.

President Maithripala Sirisena, who today inspected the Muthurajawela sanctuary, ordered the restriction of all kinds of activities including any construction and land fillings, which could result in the environment surrounding the sanctuary being destroyed, the Presidents Media Unit said.
It said the President had also instructed that the permission granted by any state institution to carry out land fillings be rescinded and disciplinary action be taken against the state officials known to be aiding in actions which would result in the sanctuary being destroyed.
Recently there were several media reports on acts of environmental pollution occurring near Muthurajawala Sancturay which is a very important wetland in Sri Lanka. In view of these reports, the President undertook an observation visit to the sanctuary.
After the visit, the President held a special meeting with ministers, government officers, and security forces chiefs before issuing those instructions.
He also directed the officials to obtain legal advice to gazette these lands as wild life and environmental conservation regions and said even for a land with ownership deeds, permission should not be granted for construction or land filling, if there is an adverse effect on the environment.
The President instructed the IGP to provide special security through Special Task Force and erect barriers on the roads that lead to the wetlands and prevent acts of environmental pollution taking place near the sanctuary.

Political power devolution integral for SLs reconciliation
	
As Sri Lanka acknowledged with its co-sponsorship of the UN resolution of 2015, devolution of political authority through constitutional reform is integral to lasting reconciliation and non-recurrence of violations and abuses, a joint statement issued by four UN member States said.
The statement issued on behalf of Macedonia, Montenegro, the US and the UK said they remain concerned about reports of abuse of authority by some security officials in Sri Lanka.
Also, the multiple incidents of inter-communal violence, attacks and hate speech against minorities are alarming and demonstrate the need for reconciliation efforts, it said.
While thanking the UNHR High Commissioner for his update on Sri Lanka, the four countries said they welcome the overall improvement in human rights and democratic reforms noted by his update.
The statement said Sri Lanka is safer and freer than it was in 2015 and The Governments constructive engagement with UN special procedures and support for the Peace-building Priority Plan is welcome.
The Consultation Task Force issued an important report to reflect the views of Sri Lankans and recent legislation on enforced disappearance is also positive. While welcoming these steps, we are disappointed that the pace of progress has been slow. Much still remains to be done to implement Sri Lankas commitments, it said.
It said families of disappeared persons from all communities have waited too long for answers and urged that the Office on Missing Persons be fully operational without delay.
With determined leadership and a clear timeline for action, this Government can deliver the reform and justice agenda, and take the actions needed to support long-term reconciliation. Sri Lanka still has an historic opportunity to avoid returning to divisions of the past. We firmly believe that implementing the reforms in the UN resolutions 34/1 and 30/1 will help give all Sri Lankans assurance of the safe, peaceful and a prosperous future, it said.

Regret slow progress in transitional justice mechanisms in SL
	
The Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) yesterday told the UNHRC that it much regrets to learn of the slow progress in establishing transitional justice mechanisms in Sri Lanka.
Speaking at the 37th session of the Human Rights Council, Kate Gilmore, the United Nations Deputy High Commissioner for Human Rights however welcomed the Governments constructive engagement with the OHCHR and the human rights mechanisms, including its cooperation with visits of this Councils Special Rapporteurs on human rights and terrorism; on truth, justice, reparation and guarantees of non-recurrence; and the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention. It said that in the absence of concrete results or publicly available drafts of legislation, it seems doubtful that the transitional justice agenda committed to by the Government under this Councils resolution 30/1 could be fully implemented before our next report in March 2019.
She also said that the HR commission was seriously concerned about multiple incidents of inter-communal violence, attacks and hate speech against minorities observed last year  a worry further exacerbated by recent developments that have occurred since the drafting of the report, including violence against Muslims in the Kandy district that led to the proclamation of a state of emergency for 12 days.
Allegations of continuing use of torture and reports of harassment or surveillance of human rights defenders are more than worrying.
In light of the gravity of the above matters and given the important role that this Council has played to date, the High Commissioner strongly advises that this Council continue to focus its attention on the human rights of the people of Sri Lanka and in particular on the processes in place for accountability and reconciliation, the statement added.

Foreign Minister Tilak Marapana told the 37th Session of the UN Human Rights Council, in Geneva that "it has a long history of integrity and professionalism and since January 2015, steps have been taken to further strengthen its independence.
The minister elaborated the actions taken by the government.
The reconciliation and development agenda cannot be successfully achieved by government working alone. The participation of political parties, civil society, academia, the business community, the media as well as the international community are essential for this important national endeavour, he said.
We would like to stress with sincerity and conviction that we will not be deterred by anyone in fulfilling the undertakings given by us to our people, which will lead to building a peaceful, stable, reconciled and prosperous Sri Lanka for all our citizens, the minister said.
The legacy of conflict in Sri Lanka is heavy, and it permeates our society to this day. Extremists constantly strive to take advantage of this situation to achieve political gain. This realization only makes us even more determined to ensure that we never return to the violent days of the past. It is our intention to ensure the fulfilment of our commitments to all our people and bring closure to a sad and disturbing period of our recent history, he said.

Strike by non-academic staff causes ripple effect State higher education system indefinitely paused
	
23 days have elapsed since the University Non-Academic Staff decided to stay away from performing their duties until their grievances are met. The University system cannot function without them. Everything from keeping the universities clean to doing most of the paper work, it is the non-academic staff that forms the entire systems heart and makes the institution function smoothly. As a result of this strike the electricity and water supply was disconnected, making things worse. More than 15,000 non-academic staff members agreed to support trade union action which began in the form of a strike on February 27. Operations in over 15 state universities and higher education institutes governed by the University Grants Commission (UGC) have come to a standstill. On March 20th (Tuesday), the University Trade Union Joint Committee (UTUJC) staged a protest where its participants walked from Rajagiriya to Parliament roundabout voicing their demands. But conditions remain the same. This indefinite strike has paralysed all academic activities including lectures and exams of undergraduates and post-graduates. 
Hence the Daily Mirror sheds light on how this strike adds hay to the already burning higher education system in the country. 
Finance Ministry not in a position to release money 
	Bio-matter and other resources at risk of dying 
	Small businesses around universities affected 
	Higher Education Minister keeps silent and travels overseas 
Strike will continue until govt. responds with a proper solution 
Inter-University Students Federation Convener Lahiru Weerasekara said that as a result of the ongoing strike, lectures, exams and other academic activities have come to a standstill. The Government doesnt seem to be providing a solution for this problem. They promptly solved the SAITM issue, but what about this problem The Government had initially agreed to pay these allowances, but it has now turned a blind eye to this issue. Therefore its fair for these people to go on strike. They would continue this strike until the Government responds properly and brings a solution,said Weerasekara. 
These allowances were never included in a budget
When contacted, the University Trade Union Joint Committee Chairman Edward Malwattage said that although they had met with the PMs Coordinating Secretary and expressed their concerns, they didnt get a satisfactory response. They understood the hardships that we were experiencing, but they didnt have a proper solution at hand. The Secretary in fact suggested that discussions should commence with the University Grants Commissions (UGC), Finance Ministry and a few other authorities, but that still doesnt address our concerns. We were asked to resume duties, but we arent ready to do that. 23 days have elapsed and all activities at state universities have been crippled. It has been one and a half years since these matters were raised in Parliament, but no allocation was made from the Budget for these allowances. As a result, the Finance Ministry is not in a position to release the money,said Malwattage. 
Speaking further Malwattage said that as a result of this strike the entire university system has been handicapped. There are various businesses which depend on the universities. For example, the bus service which manoeuvres through the Peradeniya University earns an extra income from the students who travel in it. This is the same with people doing businesses in the Pambahinna town closer to the Sabaragamuwa University. But all these services have been affected in addition to shops providing printing, photocopy and typesetting services with restaurants being among other establishments that are affected. Therefore theres a greater damage already happening than what you could just see, he said. 
These workers are requesting for an allowance which was promised sometime back. The daily activities of a university require a huge amount of money and when universities are shut, the expenditure is even higher
The Govt. seems to be ignoring state universities 
Airing his concerns, Federation of University Teachers Association (FUTA) Assistant Secretary Dr. Athulasiri Samarakoon said that the Government has to respond as quickly as possible to this issue. Theres limited focus on the education system today. One example was the SAITM issue which dragged on for years. With strikes of this nature the entire education system would be disrupted. These workers are requesting for an allowance which was promised sometime back. The daily activities of a university require a huge amount of money and when universities are shut, the expenditure is even higher. Sometimes we wonder if the Government is focusing more on Non-State Universities (NSUs) and ignoring all state universities. They should consider higher education as a priority. We see many technical educational institutes mushrooming, but theres no point in only providing technical education. In fact education should be a holistic experience for students. It is high time that the system is reformed in such a way that education is given more prominence. If not the efforts of all lecturers as well as students would be wasted, said Dr. Samarakoon. 
Speaking further Dr. Samarakoon added that there are no electricity and water facilities at all universities. Therefore bio-matter collected for research purposes are at risk. As such this strike also contributes to the wastage of resources as well. When exams are delayed, it is difficult to set timetables as well. Even these students enter universities with hopes of graduating as soon as their courses are completed. But unfortunately with these strikes, they would have to keep waiting. It is rather doubtful whether the Government is unstable to the extent that it cannot take a decision regarding this problem. So far the Higher Education minister too seems to be silent about this incident, he said. 
The Daily Mirror learned that the Higher Education and Highways Minister Kabir Hashim was to travel overseas and therefore was not available for comment. 
Several attempts made to contact UGC Chairman Prof. Mohan De Silva too proved futile. 
Its inhumane to keep animals in cages for a long time 
Footage of animals kept for research purposes at the Veterinary Teaching Hospital in Peradeniya highlighted another sorrowful aspect of the on-going strike. In addition to that, the Veterinary Clinical Science Department and the Ambulatory Clinic at the Peradeniya University is one of the many departments that have been affected by the strike. Speaking to the media, Head of the Department and Senior Lecturer in Veterinary Pharmacology Dr. Nayana Wijayawardhane said that this is not a matter only related to the wages of employees. We work with animals and cannot talk to them. Therefore we have to ensure that they are properly fed and cared for. We conduct a lot of research involving them and it is inhumane to keep them in cages for a long time, said Dr. Wijayawardhane.

The importance of enchanting forests Forests are vibrant ecosystems essential  for life on earth
	
Life on earth is impossible without trees. Besides proving shelter for wildlife and livelihoods for humans, it has a great impact on our survival. The ecosystem services provided by forests are critical to human welfare, as they provide sustainable livelihoods for people in many ways starting from the air we breathe tothe wood we use.
Forests protect watersheds and contribute to freshwater supplies by filtering and regulating water, act as a storehouse for carbon, help save energy by cooling the air, prevent soil erosion, mitigate climate change, act as an air filter and remove harmful pollutants in the air and particulates, reduce noise pollution by being a shield for homes from roads and industrial areas, serve as a buffer in natural disasters like floods, provide energy through fire-wood, provide food and medicine for local populations and animals, help to maintain and increase biodiversity, generate tourism and build economies, encourage active and healthy lifestyles by preventing diseases and improving mental health, and also provide a place for people to socialize.
The ecosystem services provided by forests are critical to human welfare
	Life on earth is impossible without trees
	the Department of Wild Life Conservation was established to manage the forest areas
About 1.6 billion of the worlds population depends on forests mainly for food, firewood, fibre, water and medicine. Despite this, people allow them to slowly disappear by destroying millions of hectares of forests every year. Although 80% of the terrestrial biodiversity lives in forests, many species go extinct as a result of the forests being destroyed.
Unplanned development led construction and urbanization could face a number of problems
History of forests and nature conservation in Sri Lanka
Sri Lankas heritage of fauna and flora protection runs as far back as 2200 years when the first (fauna & flora) wildlife sanctuary in the world was created at Mihintale, 12 km east of the UNESCO World Heritage Site of Anuradhapura by King Devanam Piyatissa (307-266 BC); long before Chief Seattle the Native American Chief made his statement about humans living in harmony with nature and land.
After the British invasion, a number of efforts, have been taken for conservation of forest resources in Sri Lanka. The major intervention was enforcing the Forest Ordinance in 1885, and Fauna and Flora ordinance in 1937. In 1947 the Department of Wild Life Conservation was established to manage the forest areas which are essential for Wild Life conservation and tourism. In 1881, the forest cover in Sri Lanka was 71% and the human population was 3.5 million. In 1956 the forest cover diminished to 44%, in 1992 to 33%, and then recorded as 29.7% at the last forest cover assessment carried out in 2015. Increasing human population pressure, large-scale agricultural and irrigation development projects, and roads and urban development programs have resulted in the sharp reduction of forest cover in Sri Lanka. About 1,200 years ago during the era of the kings, the popular concept was Reservoir- Pagoda-Cropping land (Wava-Dagaba-Ketha), where land areas were set aside and defined for specific purposes such as water catchment, agriculture, settlement, development etc.
According to the United Nations, half of humanity (around 3.5 billion people) live in cities today. By 2030, almost 60% of the worlds population will live in urban areas, and 95% of urban expansion in the next decades will take place in the developing world. The worlds cities occupy just 3% of the Earths land but account for 60-80% of energy consumption and 75% of carbon emissions. Rapid urbanization is exerting pressure on freshwater supplies, sewage, the living environment, and public health.
International Day of Forests 2018  Key message
On 28th of November, 2012, the United Nations General Assembly proclaimed March 21 as the International Day of Forests to raise awareness of the importance of all types of forests for the benefit of current and future generations. Highlighting the importance of forests, trees and greenery in urban areas, this year the International Day of Forests will address the theme Forests for sustainable cities.
-Why we need sustainable cities
Unplanned development led construction and urbanization could face a number of problems and questions such as unplanned settlements, traffic congestion, increased waste resources, weakened social control and discipline, limited social services such as housing, water supply, sanitation, education, and medical facilities, create chaos in land-use patterns and contribute to environmental challenges such as natural disasters, climate change, and pollution.
Urban environments are more complex and are subjected to strong human influence. The rapid worldwide urbanization of the human population raises concerns about the sustainability of cities. Urban forestry initiatives have seen a noteworthy level of evolution in Europe and USA. Urban forestry is a challenge and not the same approach will fit all, therefore, each country will have to find its own path. People should understand that investing in and maintaining urban forests is beneficial because healthy urban forests can be enjoyed by generations.
In 1881, the forest cover in Sri Lanka was 71% and the human population was 3.5 million

- Forests for sustainable cities and ESCAMP
In relation to this years theme - Forests for Sustainable Cities - the Ecosystem Conservation and Management Project (ESCAMP) implemented by the Forest Department, and the Department of Wildlife Conservation, addresses some of these issues in our country, mainly through its component on Pilot Landscape Planning and Management.
The goal of ESCAMP is to inspire and advance the conservation and management of ecosystems in Sri Lanka and help people - to better understand the value of forests in their surroundings, to their own lives, health, economies and well-being of their communities by protecting and expanding ecosystems, managing forests through reforestation, and increasing the understanding of the importance of forests. The values of ESCAMP are to design with nature and culture, use a decision-making hierarchy for preservation, conservation, provide regenerative systems, support a living process, use a collaborative and ethical approach, and foster environmental stewardship.
Although we have formed an International Day of Forests and heading towards progress, it is essential to know that trees dont grow up overnight, and there is still a long way to go. Every positive action we take is a step toward healing our planet. By caring for nature, we care for ourselves, therefore, protecting the trees on our planet should be a real priority for all of us, since a little care couldgo a long way.

Educatingschool children about Mental Health in Dehiowita
In 1995, Sri Lanka reported an approximate 47 deaths by suicide per day for every 100,000 persons. Over two decades later, the country reports an approximate 8-10 deaths due to suicide per day in 2018. The number of attempts at death have increased to an average of twenty. These are just reported statistics; combined with those unreported, Sri Lanka remains a country with an above average rate of suicide- and consequently, with a below average level of satisfactory mental health.
In an attempt to raise awareness on suicide prevention, mental health and to shatter the stigma revolving around mental health problems, three individuals involved in the fields of psychology and suicide prevention will embark on a 72 day walk around the coastline of Sri Lanka. Footsteps to Freedom was curated by counselling psychologist NivendraUduman in 2016 and demonstrated a successful reach with over 100 workshops conducted in 44 days due to his commitment to raising awareness on these issues.
This year, he is joining hands with colleagues for a second journey around Sri Lanka. Footsteps to Freedom is an initiative that aims to shatter the stigma on mental illness and encourage those suffering from mental illness to seek help. With the 2018 walk, we also hope to connect deeply with people from all backgrounds and communities, empower them to seek help for themselves and to look out for the wellbeing of their community, said Uduman.

In April, Uduman along with Ranil Thilakaratne and Sara Nazoor, who are actively involved in promoting suicide prevention and better mental health for all Sri Lankans will walk along the coastline, once again with the intention of raising awareness on mental health and suicide prevention.
The walk (scheduled to start on April 01st in Mount Lavinia) will consist of a series of planned and unplanned awareness raising sessions for established organisations and schools along with tea shops, bus stands and smaller village community gatherings throughout the period of 72 days. The sessions will focus on how one can recognise warning signs of those at risk of suicide, helplines available, actions an individual can take prior to seeking professional help etc,all of which will contribute towards creating a sustainable foundation that would promote better mental health and psychosocial wellbeing.
The World Health Organisation predicts that depression will be the leading cause for disability by 2020. WHO also reports that 322 million in the world currently suffer from depression, with nearly 800,000 deaths by suicide occurring annually.
In his first 550 km+ walk around the country, from Dondra to Point Pedro, Nivendra conducted over 100 sessions to raise awareness on mental health in 44 days. In 2018, Uduman is walking once again with Ranil Thilakaratne, from the CCCline 1333 and Sara Nazoor, a trainee psychologist over a span of 72 days covering approximately 1400 kilometres. The walk will be in aid of two charities working in the areas of emotional wellbeing and suicide prevention in Sri Lanka: CCCline1333 and Shanthi Maargam.

Zuckerberg admits 'mistakes' amid Trump-tied data scandal
	
Facebook honcho Mark Zuckerberg offered to testify before Congress over the Cambridge Analytica scandal as he apologized for the first time for allowing personal data to be misused in the lead up to the 2016 presidential election, the New York Daily News reported today.
After five days of silence, Zuckerberg appeared on CNN on Wednesday night and addressed the scandal by saying, So this was a major breach of trust, and Im really sorry that this happened.
You know, we have a basic responsibility to protect people's data. And if we can't do that, then we don't deserve to have the opportunity to serve people. So our responsibility now is to make sure that this doesn't happen again, he added.
Facebook has been embroiled in scandal since it was revealed Friday that the Trump campaign-connected data-mining firm Cambridge Analytica improperly accessed personal information on more than 50 million users.
The British-based company used the information to create complex algorithms that could have influenced Americans to vote for candidate Donald Trump. Those explosive revelations were exacerbated after Cambridge Analytica CEO Alexander Nix was caught on video telling an undercover Channel 4 reporter that his company "informed all the strategy" of President Trump's campaign, including "all the research, all the data, all the analytics, all the targeting."
Authorities in both the U.S. and England have questioned how Facebook could have allowed this to happen.
After Sen. Dianne Feinstein and other members of Congress called for Zuckerberg to testify, he said, So the short answer is, is I'm happy to if it's the right thing to do. Facebook testifies in Congress regularly on a number of topics, some high-profile, and some not.
And our objective is always to provide Congress...to have the most information that they can, he added.
Zuckerberg also admitted in a lengthy statement on Wednesday that the company found out in 2015 that a Moldavian scientist named Aleksandr Kogan had shared a large amount of personal data with Cambridge Analytica that he had obtained through a quiz app.
"It is against our policies for developers to share data without people's consent, so we immediately banned Kogan's app from our platform, and demanded that Kogan and Cambridge Analytica formally certify that they had deleted all improperly acquired data," Zuckerberg said.
But, as revealed last week, Cambridge Analytica did not delete a large chunk of the data, which was subsequently used for the company's Trump-connected election work.
Zuckerberg admitted Facebook made mistakes and could have done more to make sure the data was actually deleted. He pledged to take a number of steps in upcoming weeks to beef up the social media platform's privacy, including auditing all apps that have had access to large amounts of personal data.
Zuckerberg also promised that developers will be blocked from accessing personal data if it's been more than three months since the users last went on their apps.
"I'm responsible for what happens on our platform," Zuckerberg said. "While this specific issue involving Cambridge Analytica should no longer happen with new apps today, that doesn't change what happened in the past."
CNN correspondent Laurie Segall also confronted Zuckerberg about Facebooks impact on the 2016 elections but he avoided a direct answer and said, Oh, thats hard.Its really hard for me to have a full assessment of that before listing a number of different forces at play.
If you told me in 2004 when I was getting started with Facebook that a big part of my responsibility today would be to help protect the integrity of elections against interference by other governments, you know, I wouldn't have really believed that was going to be something that I would have to work on 14 years later, he said.
Russian troll farms utilized Facebook, along with other social media platforms, to create divisive content and targeted ads that reached millions of Americans ahead of the 2016 elections.
When asked whether Facebook should be regulated, Zuckerberg suggested he was open to the possibility and turned the conversation to online advertisements.
Im actually not sure we shouldnt be regulated, Zuckerberg said Wednesday.
If you look at how much regulation there is around advertising on TV, in print, you know, it's just not clear why there should be less on the internet. You should have the same level of transparency required, Zuckerberg said.
People should know who is buying the ads they see on Facebook, and you should be able to go to any page and see all the ads people are running to different audiences, he added.
Facebook has seen its stocks plummet even though it quickly banned Cambridge Analytica from its platforms after news of the personal data misuse first surfaced.
