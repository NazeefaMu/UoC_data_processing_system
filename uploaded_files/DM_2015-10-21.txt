Video: Action soon on Avant Garde: RW
	
	There was no move by the Attorney General or anyone else to sweep the Avant Garde case under the carpet, but facts were being looked at to file legal action against the company under the Money Laundering Act, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe informed Parliament today.
	Premier Wickremesinghe, who was responding to a question raised by Chief Opposition Whip Anura Kumara Dissanayake, said the Attorney General had never advised to stop the investigations at any time, but had advised to see whether there was any provision to file a case under the Money Laundering Act.
	He said the Attorney General's opinion was sought as the Solicitor General and his deputy held different views on it.
	"The Attorney General was given the opportunity of giving an opinion because of the given situation," he said.
	The Premier said this in response to a statement made by Mr. Dissanayake that the Deputy Solicitor General had informed the President that former Defence Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa can be arrested and whether to go ahead with it.
	The Prime Minister also said there was no evidence to suggest that the then Sri Lankan Ambassador in Nigeria had signed an agreement with a Nigerian company as alleged, while there was no documentary evidence that permission was given to the floating armory to station at the Galle port.
	He said the Sri Lankan security forces had not given orders to issue any arms from the Avant Garde armoury.
	He said a decision would be made by the government on the armoury, once all investigations were over. (Yohan Perera and Kelum Bandara)

Japanese Judge Noguchi calls on MR
	
	Japanese Judge Motoo Noguchi who called on former President Mahinda Rajapaksa at his residence this morning has agreed that the best course of action was to have judicial mechanisms manned by Sri Lankas own nationals, a statement issued by the former presidents media office said.
	When Mr. Rajapaksa has said that the appointment of foreign experts as judges exercising judicial power in respect of the Sri Lankan armed forces and other Sri Lankan citizens was at no time contemplated by his government, Mr. Noguchi has agreed that the best solution was to have a domestic judicial mechanism.
	The appointment of foreign experts as judges is politically unacceptable to our people and also because it involved conflict with basic provisions of the constitution of Sri Lanka, Mr. President has said.
	He has described in some detail the challenges which confronted his government and the strategies which he put in place to overcome them.
	Meanwhile, Mr. Rajapaksa clarified that the intention of his government, in response to a written request by Chairman Maxwell Paranagama was to secure for the benefit of the Sri Lankan commission the expertise of several international experts including Mr. Noguchi.
	Mr. Noguchi appreciated the invitation extended by the former government to serve in an advisory capacity to assist the Commission on Missing Persons and described his experience in the war crimes tribunal of Cambodia and the manner in which it was functioning.
	Mr. Rajapaksa pointed out the fundamental difference between the Sri Lankan and Cambodian contexts, and referred to the salient features of the Sri Lankan situation, the basic element of which was the eradication of terrorism and the availability of the opportunity today for all citizens of Sri Lanka irrespective ethnic identity, to live in an atmosphere of peace and tranquility.
	Former External Affairs Minister G.L Peiris was also present at the meeting.

	Speaker Karu Jayasuriya said today that a parliamentary session cost as much as Rs.4.6 million and therefore the MPs should take their work seriously in the wake of a tense situation over the mispronunciation of Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake's name by UPFA MP Bandula Gunawardane during a speech.
	The atmosphere turned noisy after Mr. Karunanayake demanded the resignation of Mr. Gunawardena.
	He accused him of mispronouncing his name to give a wrong impression about him to the people and it was a malicious act.
	However, Mr. Gunawardane said he apologized to the Minister with permission from the Speaker, and therefore there was no need to make a fuss about it. The commotion that existed led to the session being adjourned for a short while. (Kelum Bandara and Yohan Perera)

Paranagama Commission rejects Darusman Commission's findings
	
	Rejecting that findings of the Darusman report that 40,000 civilians were killed during the final stages of the war and numerous other findings, the Commission of Inquiry into Abductions and Disappearances (Maxwell Paranagama Commission) had stated that it was the LTTE that had killed a majority of the civilians even up to the last hours of the conflict.
	The Paranagama Commission's report was tabled in Parliament by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe last afternoon.
	In coming to its findings about the LTTE, the Commission was cognisant of the fact that every major NGO and many international organisations recognized the parasitic conduct of the LTTE in its treatment of Tamil civilian population, including the forcible recruitment of children as soldiers, particularly in the last stages of the war," the report said.
	According to the report, it had been estimated by a respected Jaffna-based NGO that, in the final 12 hours of the conflict, a majority of the Tamil civilian casualties were caused by the LTTE.
	Denying that the army was involved in the killings, the report rejected the suggestion that civilians were either targeted directly or indiscriminately by the army as a part of an alleged genocide plan. Referring to the matter, the reports executive summary said: Commission finds that the Darusman Report, as well as other reports, have taken a particularly narrow and restricted view of the obligation upon the government to prosecute offenders.
	The LTTE was 'principally responsible for the loss of civilian life during the final phase of the armed conflict through their actions which included taking 300,000 to 330,000 civilian hostages, implementing a strategy of killing Tamil civilians to suit their military aims, using civilians as a strategic human buffer leading to considerable loss of civilian life, using hostages to dig trenches and build fortifications thereby exposing them to harm, sacrificing countless civilians hostages to keep the LTTE leadership in power.'
	The report also said that the LTTE had been arming hostages and forcing them into the front line leading to the deaths of large numbers, forcing a great number of children to man the front lines.
	However the commission also stated that shelling by the security forces had also caused a significant number of civilian deaths. The commission accepted that shelling by the SLA undoubtedly led to a significant number of civilian deaths, but the commission stresses that this was an inevitable consequence of the LTTEs refusal to permit civilians to leave their control in order to use them both as a shield and a pool for recruitment, even when the GOSL permitted a ceasefire on April 12, the report said.
	The Commission had recommended that to, deal with the issue of missing persons, effective mechanisms must be established at various levels. It also recommended providing livelihood development assistance and a process of counseling and psychosocial related services. Finally, an effective Truth and Reconciliation Commission had also been recommended.
	The Commission of Inquiry into Abductions and Disappearances (Maxwell Paranagama Commission) conducted 12 public sittings in the North and the East. Each public sitting was spread over a period of four days.
	The Commission, chaired by Maxwell Paranagama, comprised Suranjana Vidyaratne, Mano Ramanthan, WAT Rathnayaka, H Sumanapala and Maxwell Paranagama. (Yohan Perera and Kelum Bandara)

PMK wants TN varsities to conduct distance education in SL
	
	PMK leader S. Ramadoss on Tuesday appealed to the University Grants Commission (UGC) to allow universities in Tamil Nadu to conduct correspondence courses in Sri Lanka for the benefit of Tamil students in Sri Lanka.
	The UGC had directed the universities not to run off-campus/ study centre/ outreach centre outside the territorial jurisdiction of the State.
	The UGC direction will affect the future of students, particularly 5,000 Tamil teachers in government run schools because the government there had made it mandatory for them to complete degree courses in five years. If distance education centres are closed they cannot continue their degree courses, Dr. Ramadoss said.
	Recalling the stay granted by the Madras High Court on the direction of the University Grants Commission on a petition filed by the Annamalai University, Dr Ramadoss said though he did not want to go into the details of the case, the UGC should allow universities to conduct distance education in Sri Lanka.

	The Police Legal Divisions Acting Director has been removed from his post with immediate effect while several officers are being investigated after the Legal Division failed to represent IGP N. K Illangakoon in the Prageeth Ekanligoda case earlier this month.
	Clarifying certain news reports that the IGP had overlooked the Court of Appeal directions to appear in Court on October 9, Police said the fault lay with the police legal division which had failed to carry out its duty.
	The Police said IGP Illangakoon was noticed to appear with regard to the Habeas Corpus application filed on behalf of three army officers held in remand custody in connection with the disappearance of Mr. Ekneligoda.
	The IGP was overseas at the time and the legal division was expected to represent him in Court but it had not happened, a police statement said. 
	The IGPs failure to appear prompted the court to issue notice directing him to appear on October 16. An internal investigation is being conducted while the acting director was removed from his post. (Darshana Sanjeewa)

SA High Commissioner warns against complacence
	
	The South African High Commissioner to Sri Lanka Geoff Doidge warned that Sri Lanka should not get too comfortable with the 'honeymoon period' granted by the international community and the human rights fraternity with regard to the UNHRC resolution passed last month.
	"Everything will not be hunky-dory for long. In my opinion it is the calm before the storm, he said.
	The High Commissioner made these comments at a training workshop on a transitional justice mechanism organised by the National Peace Council (NPC) of Sri Lanka.
	He added that Sri Lanka should not dismiss the report and the resolution and let the recommendations made in the investigative reports fade away -- as inaction would have consequences.
	Criticising the previous regime for not implementing the recommendations, he said that nothing was done by it even though the time and the environment were right to take action in 2011 .
	However, he said, Sri Lanka had no excuses now, especially taking into account the fact that Sri Lanka had co-sponsored the resolution. He also warned that there was no getting away with it and, therefore, it was best to face the issues and deal with them.
	The High Commissioner pointed out that there were several issues that needed resolution; as Sri Lanka had to deal with a past consisting of decades of political oppression and war.
	"There is a trust deficit in Sri Lanka, one hand does not trust the other, he said.
	He said that, going by the South African experience, the best way to deal with these issues would be to establish a tailor-made Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC). He also emphasised the need to release political prisoners.
	He urged the government to learn from the successes of the South African experience and not repeat its mistakes.(Shihara Maduwage)

SL born Khamshajiny to become Dy. Mayor of Oslo
	
	Sri Lankan born Khamshajiny Gunaratnam is to become the new deputy mayor of Oslo as Norways Labour Party and its Green and Socialist allies retake the city after eight years of Conservative rule.
	Gunaratnam was 23-years-old when Norwegian terrorist Anders Behring Breivik attacked the Labour party summer camp she was attending on the island of Utya in 2011.
	The 27-year-old Utya survivor who styles herself Kamzy  was born in Sri Lanka and moved to Norway when she was three years old.
	
	She will be formally elected at a meeting of the citys new council on Wednesday.
	
	She will serve under the citys new mayor Marianne Borgen, a longstanding politician for the Socialist Left party.
	
	Borgens appointment ended hopes that the city could see its first Muslim mayor, after the Green Partys candidate Shoaib Sultan became sidelined in the Labour Partys coalition deal.
	
	It was for me the safest place in the world, she told the New York Times after the event in Utya.
	
	She told the Financial Times how she decided to try to swim to land from the island, despite seeing many turning back in exhaustion. 
	
	Eventually, I decided I would rather drown than be shot, she said. (thelocal.no)

Somawansa ready to join even Wimal to defeat UN resolution
	
Former JVP leader and present leader of the Janatha Sewaka Party, Somawansa Amarasinghe today said he would join with any political party or any politician including Wimal Weerawansa if they have a definite agenda to defeat national challenge of the resolution adopted by UNHRC.
Speaking to Daily Mirror, he said he intends to have discussions with any politician before teaming up to defeat the investigative mechanism proposed by UNHRC resolution.
He said it is high time to create a national push against the so-called UN resolution that leads to a separate state in the country.
We need a proper and certain agenda based on democracy and equality to defeat the UN resolution which has violated even the UN convention. This propaganda is handled by separatists because such global organisation is not supposed to adopt country-specific resolutions violating the countrys sovereignty and Constitution. But, in our case, they have proposed to amend the Constitution and Judiciary of our country. I cant remain silent when such resolution is destroying our independent state, Mr. Somawansa said.
