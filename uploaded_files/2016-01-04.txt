A fish tank project that smells fishy!
	
An aquarium has been put up in the Gampaha district at a cost of Rs.11.8 million without following the tender procedure, they say.
A fair white collar high up had given the okay for the aquarium project on the request of a prominent politician in the area.?
Meanwhile, a big question mark hangs over how funds had been raised to purchase a coconut estate in the name of the husband of the fair white collar bigwig.
The informed ones discussing the doings of this lady recall that once when her husband, a class two officer in the administrative service was transferred to the pool, she used her clout to nominally attach him to her office enabling him to enjoy a 14-month holiday with all perks including an official vehicle at his disposal.

My wife threatened to divorce me if I gave my Peacock Mansion to MR
	
	My wife threatened to divorce me if I gave my Peacock Mansion to former president Mahinda Rajapaksa, Sri Lanka Labour Party Leader and Entrepreneur A.S.P. Liyanage said today.
	A.S.P. Liyanage arrived at the Bribery Commission today to make a statement in connection with his offer to hand over the Rs.830 million worth Peacock Mansion at Rajagiriya to former president Mahinda Rajapaksa.
	While addressing the media, he said, the main reason for not giving his mansion to Mahinda Rajapaksa was his wife?s insistence. She said she would divorce him if he did. This was the only force that was used on him.
	No other people influenced me. She did this for my own safety, not to harm me,? he said.
	?I was hoping to hand over my Peacock Mansion to the former president Mahinda Rajapakasa for two years, until he got his official house.
	Holding this kind of investigation is good because everyone will come to know the reason behind my offering Peacock Mansion to the former president,? he said.
	While recording my statement, the Bribery Commission wanted to know whether I had any agreement to sell or hand over my mansion to the former president.
	?One should have the freedom to hand over anything anyone free of charge. That is the fair method in the world. But, unfortunately, we now have no independence. I also escaped by a hairsbreadth,? he said.
	My statement was recorded due to many complaints made by several organizations, but this investigation ended today. The Bribery Commission said they would inform me if they needed any more information.
	The complaints made against me were fair. Everyone has the right to make complaints. Mahinda Rajapaksa is very fond of to my house. He visited my place several times and he will come to my house even today if I ask him. President Maithripala Sirirsena has given him an official residence but he hasn?t gone there yet.

Deadly earthquake shakes India, Bangladesh
	
	A 6.7 magnitude earthquake hit India?s remote northeast region before dawn on Monday, killing at least four people, injuring 100 others and causing damage to several buildings.
	The death and injuries were caused by falling debris in and around Imphal, the capital of Manipur state, police said.
	The powerful tremor left large cracks in walls and a portion of a popular market building collapsed in the state capital.
	A newly constructed six-storey building also collapsed in Imphal, the police control room said.
	The early morning tremor was also strongly felt in the Bangladeshi capital Dhaka. Police there said 40 people were being treated at a major hospital, including one university student who jumped from a fourth-floor balcony and was in a critical condition.
	India?s meteorological department said the epicenter of the quake was in Tamenglong region of Manipur state, near the country?s borders with Myanmar and Bangladesh.
	The US Geological Survey said the depth of the quake was 55km (34 miles).
	The tremor hit at 4.35 am (23.05 GMT Sunday) 29km west-northwest of the city of Imphal, USGS said.
	People panicked and rushed out of their homes in Gauhati, the capital of neighbouring Assam state, as they felt massive shaking at least twice within 60 seconds.
	In its initial assessment, USGS said ?some casualties and damage are possible and the impact should be relatively localised?.
	It said buildings in the area were largely ?highly vulnerable to earthquake shaking?. The area is dotted with small houses and there are few tall buildings in the region.
	USGS issued a yellow alert for casualties and damage, with a 35% likelihood of between one and 10 deaths from the tremor.
	Residents of Imphal said furniture was knocked over and books fell off shelves. ?The ground swayed for almost a minute, jolting people awake in their homes,? said one resident, Apem Arthur.
	The tremors were also felt in Kolkata, the capital of West Bengal state, some 600km distant. ?Many people were seen coming out of their homes in panic,? said local resident Rabin Dev.
	India?s seven northeastern states, joined to the rest of the country by a narrow sliver of land, are located in an area of frequent seismic activity. The border region is remote and sparsely populated on the Myanmar side.

HRC calls for abolishing death penalty
	
	The Human Rights Commission today said that it had recommend President Maithripala Sirisena to abolish the death penalty in Sri Lanka in keeping with the country?s commitment to a more humane society consonant with the human rights principles and values.
	?The Human Rights Commission wishes to bring to Your Excellency?s and the Government?s attention to the recommendations regarding the abolition of the death penalty, which is imperative for Sri Lanka in recognition of the growing global recognition that the death penalty seriously violates several human rights including the right to life and freedom from cruel and inhuman punishment,? the Commission said.
	In a letter signed by Commission?s Chairman Dr. N. D. Udagama, the Commission said that it advise and assist the government in formulating legislation to promote and protect fundamental rights and to ensure that national laws and administrative practices are in accordance with international human rights norms and standards.
	The letter said the death penalty was an extreme, irreversible punishment and is ineffective as a deterrent to crime.
	It said Sri Lanka should demonstrate its commitment to the sanctity of life and fundamental human rights principles by joining the more than 100 nations in the world that have abolished the death penalty thus far. ?Another 60 countries do not carry out death sentences in practice,? it said.

Maldives says SL didn't blacklist top diplomat, MP
	
	The Maldivian Government denied Sunday reports that authorities of Sri Lanka had confiscated passports of two high ranking Maldivian officials after they were blacklisted "by mistake."
	Haveeru reported that the passports of foreign minister Dhunya Maumoon and her brother Faris Maumoon, who is a parliamentarian, were confiscated after they travelled to Sri Lanka on an unofficial visit. They were reportedly held at the airport for more than an hour before being told that they had been blacklisted ?by mistake?.
	Denying the report, the foreign ministry said on twitter that several Maldivians travelling overseas since the terrorist attacks in the US on September 11, 2001 face questions at immigration counters at various airports.
	?Names of Minister Dunya & MP Faris never blacklisted, and their passports never confiscated,? a tweet read.
	Dhunya and Faris -- children of former president Maumoon Abdul Gayoom -- was in Sri Lanka to visit a relative admitted at a Sri Lankan hospital. Their father and other family members had separately gone to Sri Lanka to visit their relative receiving treatment, but they did not face any obstacles.
	On his visit, Gayoom met Sri Lankan President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, while Dhunya separately met with the prime minister.
	The incident followed the arrest of three people over a recent assassination plot on the president that involved a sniper brought into Maldives from Sri Lanka.

Meethotamulla protest: Lawyers, Police clash compels court to adjourn
	
Court adjourned for ten minutes amid heated arguments between the Police and the lawyers for the aggrieved party when the case, on the attack on those protesting against the dumping of garbage at Meetotamulla, was taken up for inquiry today.
Magistrate Mohamed Mihiran left the bench during the heated inquiry between the two parties accusing each other of insulting the Court.
In this case, the Kolonnawa UC Chairman Ravindra Udayashantha is charged with having assaulted those who participated at a peaceful picket against dumping of garbage in Meethotamulla.
The lawyers said the police had not arrested the other suspects who are alleged to have assaulted the protesters because the police was biased in favour of the UC chairman and his supporters.
Later the Magistrate who resumed the inquiry released Mr. Udayashantha on bail with two sureties of Rs.100,000 each.
The Magistrate said the UC chairman would be remanded until the adjudication of the case if he engaged in such acts again.
The Magistrate also directed the Police to arrest the other suspects involved in the assault and to produce them in Court. (T. Farook Thajudeen)

PHU holds 'black' news conference
	
Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) General Secretary Udaya Gammanpila, who earlier requested the people to display black flags to oppose the actions of the government, today organised a ?black? news conference and said Sri Lanka was experiencing one of the darkest eras of its history under the reign of the present government.
The MP, along with other party officials, wore black clothes and held the weekly news briefing of the PHU in front of a black coloured banner at the party head office in Kotte.
?Instead of our usual colour white, we decided to wear black today to convey our objection to the administration of the government and so-called Yahapalanaya which commenced on January 8, last year. As soon as the President was appointed on January 8, he appointed the Prime Minister violating the Constitution. This is how the journey of the Yahapalanaya started,? he said.
He said the Central Bank Bond Sale issue which took place last year had caused the deflation of the Rupee and the Financial Crime Investigation Division (FCID) established by the government was similar to Adolf Hitler?s Gestapo.
MP Gammanpila said the underworld was also reviving its head again and the Colombo City had turned into a hell. He said the government was protecting MP Hirunika Premachandra, who was allegedly linked with an abduction incident at Dematagoda.
?These are a few unwise and harmful actions and behaviour of the government and this is why we request the people to hoist black flags to convey their objection to the government. We don?t want to rebel to topple the government, we simply want to get it on the correct path. If it failed, we will topple the government,? he said.? (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Crown Witness alleges Navy officials involved in Raviraj killing
	
While giving evidence relating to the inquiry on the killing of former TNA Jaffna District MP Nadaraja Raviraj led by the DSG, the crown witness of the inquiry, Sampath Prithiviraj, revealed that the alleged killing was planned by officials attached to the Navy intelligence office located in the Gangarama, Laundrywatta area at that time.
The witness was earlier a suspect in the incident and later turned a witness to the case.
He stated that he had served as a motor bike rider for special operations in Batticaloa, where he started connections with the suspect Palana Sami Suresh.
In 2006, after he had arrived in Colombo, he once again continued his relationship with ?Sami? and through him got to know Prasad Kumara, Charan, Wajira, Gamini Seneviratne, Fabian Royston Toussaint and other intelligence officials.
He further stated that the suspect, Sami, had taken him to the Navy Intelligence Office in Gangarama and introduced him to other officials.
On November 8, 2006, he was told by the suspect Sami that they had attempted to kill Mr. Raviraj but failed.
Then in November 10, 2006, he was summoned by the same suspect to attack some LTTE cadres.
The witness was asked to come to the Borella Cemetery junction in the morning in the motor bike which was provided by the suspects.
Then Prasad, Seneviratne, Wajira and three others had come to the place in two three-wheelers, while Sami, Charan and Toussaint had arrived in another three-wheeler.
He further stated in his statement that he was only asked to stay at the Martha Road junction and take the shooter and flee from the scene.
He stated the suspect ?Seneviratne? was with a black bag and waited until the former MP?s vehicle arrived.
Then the suspect Seneviratne came from the opposite side of Raviraj?s vehicle and shot Raviraj and his driver Lakshman and fled with the witness to the Navy Intelligence Office located in Laundrywatta on Gangarama road.
The witness further declared that he was unaware with the incident fully as he didn?t know about the victim until they finished the operation and came to the navy Intelligence office in Laundrywatta.
After the leading evidence in the non summary inquiry, the Deputy Solicitor General allowed for the cross examination.
The defense counsel requested for another date to cross examine the witness as they needed to peruse the statements of the witness and get advice from their clients.
Earlier, seven suspects, Palana Sami Suresh, Prasad Hettiarachchi, Gamini Seneviratne, Pradeep Chaminda, Sivakanth Vivekanandan, Fabian Royston Toussaint and Sampath Munasinghe were charged on five counts over the killing of Mr. Raviraj.
The Court had also on the last occasion fixed to hear the case in the absentia of three suspects of Palana Sami Suresh, Sivakanth Vivekanandan and Fabian Royston Toussaint under clause 148 of Code of Criminal Procedure.

?Will not act in haste on special court?: President
	
	The? Sri Lankan government would not act ?in haste? on the issue of setting up a special court on allegations of violations of human rights in the last stages of the civil war, President Maithripala Sirisena said yesterday.
	Answering questions on the status of implementation of a resolution adopted by the United Nations Human Rights Council in October on accountability, Mr. Sirisena, in an exclusive interview with The Hindu at his residence, replied in Sinhala that what should be done first was to ?evaluate? what had happened [during the war]. Only after ascertaining the situation would ?subsequent steps? become necessary. Calling for a gradual approach in the implementation, he alluded to the resolution and maintained that ?we have not been ordered to do anything.? The government would do ?whatever is necessary.? The implementation should be a ?collective exercise,? he said, referring to the establishment of a body headed by former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga on reconciliation and another institution to go into complaints regarding alleged disappearances.
	As for the move to draft a new Constitution, the President pointed out that he would make a statement in Parliament on January 9, initiating the process. However, he clarified that only after a ?comprehensive, organised and nationwide? debate among different sections such as constitutional experts and civil society organisations, would a decision be taken whether a fresh Constitution was needed or amendments to the existing Constitution were sufficient.
	The debate was expected to go on for a year. At the same time, Mr. Sirisena made it clear that he was firm on the abolition of executive presidency, one of his key promises during the 2015 January presidential elections. Asked whether the 13th Amendment, an outcome of the India-Sri Lanka agreement of 1987, would be retained in the event of having a new Constitution, he replied that this would be finalised at the conclusion of the debate.
	On his stand on devolution, Mr. Sirisena recalled that Sri Lanka had a ?long history? of devolution and emphasised that new constitutional provisions should be made after a ?proper study? of issues concerning the nation?s sovereignty and interests.
