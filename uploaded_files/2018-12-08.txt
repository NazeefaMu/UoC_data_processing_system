Amid riot fears France to close Eiffel Tower, Louvre
	
PARIS REUTERS Dec 6 - France will close the Eiffel Tower and other tourism landmarks in Paris and draft in thousands more security forces on Saturday to stave off another wave of violent protests in the country over living costs.? ?
?With protesters from the ?yellow vest? movement calling on social media for ?Act IV? - a fourth weekend of protest - Prime Minister Edouard Philippe said 89,000 police nationwide would be deployed to stop a repeat of last Saturday?s mayhem across France.? ?About 8,000 of these would be deployed in Paris where rioters torched cars and looted shops off the famed Champs Elysees boulevard, and defaced the Arc de Triomphe with graffiti directed at President Emmanuel Macron.? ?
?Seeking to regain the initiative after weeks of civil unrest, the government appeared ready to offer concessions. Yet, five days after the worst rioting central Paris has seen since 1968, all signs are that the government has failed to quell the revolt.? ?
?A repeat of last Saturday?s violence in Paris?s city centre would deal a blow to the economy and raise doubts over the government?s survival.

Corbyn signals Labour may back a second referendum
	
UK, (Daily Mail), 7 December 2018 - Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn has given his clearest indication yet that Labour is moving towards backing a second referendum.??
Writing for the Guardian, the Labour leader said ?all options should be on the table? in the event Theresa May?s Brexitdeal is voted down next week.??
He said that if the deal was defeated, the Government will have lost its majority in Parliament and its ability to govern.??
Labour?s line until now has been to call for a general election to break the deadlock so they could try to negotiate Brexit.??
But Mr Corbyn said that should there be no general election, all options should be open - including a second referendum.??
?In the past, a defeat of such seriousness as May now faces would have meant an automatic election. But if under the current rules we cannot get an election, all options must be on the table,??he said.?

## Title: How many are ready to die for democracy?

How many are ready to die for democracy?
	
At a time of unprecedented political turmoil when Sri Lanka?s political leadership and people?s mainline representatives are in a crisis where for most of them their reputation has been shattered, the world on Wednesday marked the fifth anniversary of the death of South Africa?s legendary President Nelson Mandela.? ?
Much is the inspiration, the encouragement and ideals that Nelson Mandela could give to world leaders and politicians. We hoped that in overcoming the current crisis our leaders also will take the right perspective and paradigm shift from Mr. Mandela and become game changers. Thereby they will be remembered in the golden pages of our history, rather than ending up in a garbage dump. One of his main lessons was that he lived for democracy, and a free society, would fight for it, and was even ready to die for it.? ?
After serving decades in prison and suffering much, he peacefully won the power struggle of South Africa?s black majority and became the President in July 1994. The people loved him and he could have served for a lifetime, but chose to retire after one term. This is another important lesson for our leaders who appear to have problems in letting go because power corrupts even the best of leaders.
?Instead of persecuting the white minority leaders, President Mandela set up the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC), where the white minority leaders were given an opportunity to admit their guilt, to be forgiven and play their role in society. During the proceedings of the TRC, one military officer was on trial for killing the husband and the only son of a coloured woman. When he pleaded guilty, the commission asked the woman how she would respond to it. She made two requests. One was to be shown where her husband was buried so that she could go and pay her respects. The woman paused before making her second request. A hushed court also waited and when the judge asked what her second request was, she told the young killer, I want you to come and be my son. The young killer collapsed in disbelief, but through Nelson Mandela, the world came to know of the power of repentance, forgiveness and reconciliation.?
?
Mr. Mandela was born on July 18, 1918. Hearing the elders? stories of his ancestors? valour during the wars of resistance, he dreamed also of making his own contribution to the freedom struggle of his people.? ?
Mr. Mandela began his studies for a Bachelor of Arts degree at the University College of Fort Hare but did not complete the degree there as he was expelled for joining in a student protest. He later completed his BA through the University of South Africa and went back to Fort Hare for his graduation in 1943.? ?
According to the Mandela Foundation, the legendary leader, while increasingly politically involved from 1942, only joined the African National Congress in 1944 when he helped to form the ANC Youth League. Mr. Mandela rose through the ranks of the ANC Youth League and through its efforts, the ANC adopted a more radical mass-based policy, in 1949.? ?
In 1952 he was chosen as the National Volunteer-in-Chief of the Defiance Campaign with Maulvi Cachalia as his deputy. This campaign of civil disobedience against six unjust laws was a joint programme between the ANC and the South African Indian Congress. He and 19 others were charged under the Suppression of Communism Act for their part in the campaign and sentenced to nine months of hard labour, suspended for two years. A two-year diploma in law on top of his BA allowed Mandela to practise law, and in August 1952 he and Oliver Tambo established South Africa?s first black law firm, Mandela & Tambo. At the end of 1952, he was banned for the first time. As a restricted person he was only permitted to watch in secret as the Freedom Charter was adopted in Kliptown on June 26, 1955.
On October 9 1963, Mr. Mandela joined 10 others on trial for sabotage in what became known as the Rivonia Trial. While facing the death penalty his words to the court at the end of his famous Speech from the Dock on April 20, 1964, became immortalised. ?I have fought against white domination and I have fought against black domination. I have cherished the ideal of a democratic and free society in which all people live together in harmony and with equal opportunities. It is an ideal which I hope to live for and to achieve. But if needs are, it is an ideal for which I am prepared to die. ?? ?
On this Mandela Remembrance Day, we would like Sri Lanka?s leaders and other politicians to ask themselves, how many are ready to die for democracy and a free society.? ?

## Title: Immunity not to President's actions: Kanag Iswaran PC

Immunity not to President's actions: Kanag Iswaran PC
	
President?s Counsel K. Kanag Iswaran yesterday countering the arguments of the respondents and the intervernient petitioners underlined the fact that the immunity conferred on the Executive President was only on his person and not on his acts or actions.
Kanag Iswaran PC appearing for TNA Leader R. Sampanthan said this before the seven-judge bench of the Supreme Court which took up for hearing the fundamental rights petitions against the dissolution of Parliament by President.
Ten fundamental rights petitions against the dissolution of Parliament came up before the Bench comprising Chief Justice Nalin Perera, Justices Buwaneka Aluwihare, Sisira J de Abrew, Priyantha Jayawardena, Prasanna S. Jayawardena, Vijith K. Malalgoda and Murdu Fernando.
Kanag Iswaran PC said he did not propose to deal with the jungle of arguments of single instances put forward by the various respondents, on account of time constraints.
He said President?s Counsel Sanjeewa Jayawardene and the other Counsel of a similar persuasion had sought to submit to Court their interpretation of the relevant constitutional provisions on the basis of the Sinhala text of the Constitution.
Counsel said not being competent in that language, he had requested President?s Counsel Thilak Marapana and the other Counsel for the petitioners, to deal with that aspect. He informed Court that they assured him that the Sinhala version was in no way different to the English version and that he knew for a fact that the Tamil version was no different either.
He said therefore, he was responding to only the Attorney General in respect of his submissions, principally on the question of the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court to hear and determine his petition on the two grounds urged by the Attorney General, namely,
?The provisions of Article 38 (2) provide a specific mechanism ?for the Supreme Court to exercise jurisdiction over allegations of, intentional violations of the Constitution, misconduct or abuse of power by the President;
?Dissolution of Parliament by the President, does not constitute ?executive or administrative action?, falling within the purview of Article 126 of the Constitution.
He said the objection premised on Article 38 (2) was concerned and that it was clear that the said objection was based on the supposition that Article 38 (2) operates as an ouster of Articles 17 and 126 vis-?-vis the Fundamental Rights Jurisdiction of the Supreme Court.
Counsel said one section of the Constitution could not oust another section of the Constitution.
The Constitutional jurisdiction of the Supreme Court to grant relief for the infringement of Fundamental Rights by the Executive or Administrative action could not be ousted in the absence of a Constitutionally or valid derogation from that jurisdiction he pinpointed.
He said Ex facie the Constitution such an ouster cannot be validly asserted.
He brought to cognizance that a total ouster is found in the interpretation section of the Constitution, namely, Article 154J (2) ? Public Security.
He said the said interpretation section reads as, ?A Proclamation under the Public Security Ordinance or the law for the time being relating to public security, shall be conclusive for all purposes and shall not be questioned in any Court, and no Court or Tribunal shall inquire into, or pronounce on, or in any manner call in question, such Proclamation, the grounds for the making thereof, or the existence of those grounds or any direction given under this Article.?
He submitted that the Article 170, defining a judicial officer as ? ?judicial officer? means any person who holds office as a Judge of the Supreme Court or a Judge of the Court of Appeal; any Judge of the High Court or any Judge, presiding officer or member of any other Court of First Instance, tribunal or institution created and established for the administration of Justice or for the adjudication of any labour or other dispute but does not include a person who performs arbitrary functions or a public officer whose principal duty or duties is or are not the performance of functions of a judicial nature. No court or tribunal or institution shall have jurisdiction to determine the question whether a person is a judicial officer within the meaning of the Constitution but such question shall be determined by the Judicial Service Commission whose decision thereon shall be final and conclusive. No act of such person or proceeding held before such person, prior to such determination, shall be, deemed to be invalid by reason of such determination.?
Kanag Iswaran PC said the above ouster clauses seek to even exclude the Fundamental Rights jurisdiction of the Supreme Court and maintained that therefore, Article 38 is no ouster at all.
He said the petitioner is well within his rights to have invoked Articles 17 and 126 of the Constitution, because it is an acknowledged principle of law that there is no justification in law for holding that only one of the available remedies can be availed of and that the other consequently stands extinguished, nor can it be contended that the aggrieved party be confined to only one remedy.
He further said that passionate presentations were made on the question of the sovereignty of the People and the franchise of the People and the obligation of the President to heed that and for the Supreme Court to take note of that fact.
He mentioned that in passing that, the sovereignty of the People and who the depositories of that are is to be seen in Article 4 and that the Article 4 (a) provides that the sovereign legislative power of the People is in the Parliament and that the Article 4 (b) provides that the sovereign executive power of the People is in the President.
He maintained that therefore under the Constitution that the President cannot interfere with the legislature except as strictly provided by the Constitution.
The dissolution of the legislature must therefore strictly be in terms of the Constitution and the President is not a Monarch, he too is a creature of the Constitution. It is settled law that the official acts of the President constitute ?executive? actions, he said.
He submitted that the concept of ?executive and administrative? action is much wider than executive power.
He stated the Petitioners invoked a right given to them under Article 17 read with Article 126 read together with the proviso to Article 35 (1).
In terms of the proviso ?anything done or omitted to be done by the President, in his official capacity? are in fact ?executive or administrative? acts in terms of Article 17 and, therefore, the reference to Article 126 is made in the said proviso, he stressed.
The contention of the Attorney General that the President?s act is not ?executive or administrative? action is in terms of the Constitution wholly untenable, he contended.
The issue of dissolution which the Supreme Court is called upon to decide is not justiciable because it is a political question, he claimed.
He recollected that another interesting, if not intriguing, submission was about a ?legislative driven process? and a ?executive driven process?.
This description, curiously, lays emphasis only on the driver and forgets the vehicle, which is Article 70 (1), he said.
Without the vehicle, the driver cannot move. Whether legislative driven or executive driven, you need to have a Proclamation, he stated.
The functionaries of the three wings, namely, the legislature, the executive and the judiciary, derive their authority and jurisdiction from the Constitution. The Constitution is the fundamental document that provides for constitutionalism, constitutional governance and also sets out morality, norms and values which are inhered in various Articles and sometimes decipherable from the constitutional silence, he said.
Its inherent dynamism makes it organic and therefore the concept of constitutional sovereignty is sacrosanct. It is extremely sacred as the authorities get their powers from the Constitution and nowhere else. It is the source, that is the supremacy of the Constitution, he highlighted.
He reminded that passionate speeches had been made, mostly political, warning the Supreme Court of the impending dangers and the like if the dissolution is not upheld. It went as far as calling the challenge to the dissolution as terrorism, he said. He recall the words of Dr. Ambedkar: ?I feel that the constitution is workable; it is flexible and it is strong enough to hold the country together both in peace time and in war time. Indeed if I may say so, if things go wrong under the new Constitution the reason will not be that we had a bad Constitution. What we will have to say is that Man was vile.?
There were 10 fundamental rights petition filed against the declaration of dissolution of Parliament by the President. Five sought to intervene to counter the main petitions.
Petitions seek a declaration that proclamation of dissolving Parliament infringes the fundamental rights.
They ask the Court for a declaration that the decisions and/or directions in the proclamation is null and void ab initio (ineffective from the beginning) and of no force or effect in law.
The petitions were filed by Kabir Hashim and Akila Viraj Kariyawasam of UNP, Lal Wijenayeke of United Left Front, CPA, Member of the Election Commission Prof. Ratnajeevan. H. Hoole, Attorney-at-Law G.C.T. Perera, Sri Lanka Muslim Congress, All Ceylon Makkal Congress, Mano Ganesan MP.
K.Kanag Iswaran PC, Thilak Marapana PC, Dr Jayampathi Wickremaratne PC, M.A.Sumanthiran PC. Viran Corea, Ikram Mohamed PC, J.C.Weliamuna PC, Ronald Perera PC, Hisbullah Hijaz and Suren Fernando appeared for the petitioners.
Gamini Marapane PC with Nalin Marapane, Sanjeeva Jayawardane PC and Ali Sabry PC appeared for the intervenient petitioners opposing the main petitions. (S.S. Selvanayagam)

Mahinda?s Hurried Backdoor Power Grab and the Gotabhaya Factor
	
?
Consistency not necessarily a virtue in politics
19A delivered three blows to Rajapaksa family
Basil cautioned his elder brother about wisdom of being sworn in as PM without a viable majority
Gota and Namal not well-disposed towards each other
Political patronage, nepotism and family bandyism widely prevalent
?
?
By
D.B.S. Jeyaraj?
Former President and current Kurunegala district MP Mahinda Rajapaksa was interviewed regarding the present political situation by Kelum Bandara of ?Daily Mirror? last week. One of the questions posed to Mahinda in the interview was ? ?There is perception among some that you took over the government entering through the backdoor despite your ability to win elections in the future. What is your view?? Mahinda?s somewhat defensive response was as follows;?
?There is no such thing called capturing power through the backdoor. A political party is not meant to be in the opposition forever. It should try to become the ruling party on the very first occasion made available to it. We vowed to topple the government after two Vesak Poyas. One Vesak Poya is over. We toppled the government before the next Vesak Poya. Our duty is to topple the government if it is possible. It is actually in the greater interests of the country. The previous government alienated the national assets. If it continued, there would be nothing left in the country for posterity. We reversed the move to introduce a separatist Constitution. Otherwise, it would also have been declared as adopted by voice vote in Parliament (Ekath aye uye gala sammatha karai.)??
?In that context, we have taken a correct decision in the interests of the country. We also faced a similar problem with regards to the Free Trade Agreements at that time. The previous government did not think of the country. They acted in their personal interest and the interests of foreign countries?.?
The question posed by? about the perceived backdoor entry by Mahinda Rajapaksa to the prime ministerial seat is a perplexing point that has been the subject of many a political discussion. After the remarkable electoral performance of the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) at the local authorities? elections in February 2018, it was clear that the writing was on the wall for the Sirisena-Wickremesinghe Government. The situation was such where the confident Mahinda Rajapaksa camp was demanding elections to the Provincial Councils where polls were due. The government had no convincing answer. It was simply trotting out lame excuses for delaying elections thereby strengthening the impression in the country that a return of the Rajapaksas to power through elections was inevitable.?
In a further twist, President Maithripala Sirisena and Mahinda Rajapaksa who were supposedly at loggerheads with each other seemingly buried the hatchet in a political move aimed at undermining Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe. The political grapevine buzzed with the news that the Sirisena and the Rajapaksa camps had realigned politically. There were also unconfirmed reports of clandestine canvassing of members from many shades of opinion within Parliament. A substantial number of MPs from the SLFP as well as sections of the UNF were tipped to switch loyalties. There was a strong possibility of the UPFA-SLFP faction within the government ?officially? pulling out. Speculation was rife that the political reconfiguration process would result in a defeat for the government during the budget vote. If and when this happened President Sirisena was expected to appoint Mahinda Rajapaksa as the Prime Minister who would then be seen as commanding the confidence of the House in a drastically-reconfigured Parliament. This belief began gathering momentum and it seemed that the return of the Rajapaksas was inevitable. Many even began preparing for such an eventuality.?
?
PURPORTED PRIME MINISTER AND MINISTERS?
Against this backdrop, where Mahinda Rajapaksa was expected to march in triumphantly towards his rightful position of Prime minister through the proverbial front door, recent events have belied all such speculation. Instead of the anticipated front door entrance, Mahinda made an unexpected backdoor entry. On October 26 President Sirisena removed Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and replaced him with Mahinda Rajapaksa as prime minister. The newly-appointed Premier did not have a majority. In order to facilitate the cobbling together of a majority of MPs through various ?incentives,? Parliament itself was prorogued until November 16. Although some MPs did jump from horse to horse through suspected horse deals and were rewarded with posts and perks, there were no large-scale crossovers. As a result of which a viable majority eluded Mahinda Rajapaksa. This very obvious truth was demonstrated on more than one occasion with a majority of Parliamentarians voting adversely against the purported Prime Minister Rajapaksa and his purported ministers.?
President Sirisena then dissolved Parliament and scheduled fresh elections in another controversial move. Several Fundamental rights petitions were filed against the presidential decree and a Three -Judge Bench of the Supreme Court issued a stay order after preliminary hearings. In a related development, 122 MPs sought a writ of Quo Warranto from the court of appeal against purported Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa and 48 others functioning as purported cabinet ministers, state ministers and deputy ministers respectively. The Appeal? Court too issued an interim order temporarily restraining Mahinda Rajapaksa and others functioning as Prime minister and as ministers pending final determination of the case. Likewise a seven judge bench of the Supreme Court headed by Chief Justice Nalin Perera commenced hearing the FR petition cases against dissolution of Parliament and scheduling of elections.?
?
In what appears to be an indecent haste to capture power, Mahinda Rajapaksa seems to have miscalculated badly in getting himself appointed as a ?Prime Minister without a majority? to Replace a ?Prime Minister with a majority?
?
The cumulative result of all these happenings has resulted in the diminution of Mahinda Rajapaksa?s political stature and reputation.
Notwithstanding the current political crisis, there is no doubt that Mahinda Rajapaksa is the single-most popular mass-figure in the seven Sinhala majority provinces of Sri? Lanka. In spite of this mass support, Mahinda Rajapaksa has been unable to utilize it appropriately and mount the Prime Ministerial seat gloriously. His hasty, ill-advised attempt to grab power through Machiavellian stratagems has resulted in Mahinda cutting a pathetically forlorn figure. The man described as the ?Medamulana Machiavelli? has been denied the spoils of prime ministerial office. Furthermore his larger than life image has been considerably dented. Mahinda is depicted by his detractors as a selfish, power hungry politician without principles or scruples who would resort to diabolical measures to seize power. While Maithripala Sirisena goes on ranting and raving against Ranil Wickremesinghe, the downsized Mahinda is not very vocal nowadays. The once mighty roar of the ?Lion of Ruhunu? is mostly inaudible and whenever audible, sounds like a howl of a Hyena deprived of its (not so rightful) prey.?
?
BRANDED WITH STAMP OF ILLEGITIMACY?
It is in this context that friend and foe alike keep wondering as to why Mahinda Rajapaksa has placed himself in this predicament. In what appears to be an indecent haste to capture power, Mahinda Rajapaksa seems to have miscalculated badly in getting himself appointed as a ?Prime Minister without a majority? to Replace a ?Prime Minister with a majority.? His short- lived, highly-contested stint as Prime Minister is now branded with the stamp of illegitimacy. This makes many ponder as to why Mahinda was in such an undue hurry to grab power through questionable methods when power may have been handed over to him on a platter had he been patient. The Kurunegala district MP himself is aware of such opinion and has tried to offer explanations whenever possible. His response in the ?Daily Mirror? interview is one clear example.?
There have been other such instances too. Some days before the ?? interview, Mahinda Rajapaksa addressed a gathering at his office on Nov 25th.The text of a speech delivered by the Ex-president was issued as a media release. In that speech Mahinda made reference to this burning question and stated as follows ? ?Some people ask me why I accepted office when there was less than 18 months to go for the next elections. I have heard members of the UNP saying that if I had been patient for another 18 months, I could have won the ensuing election with a two thirds majority. We did not form a government to continually administer the country but to hold a general election. The President explained in his address to the nation that he appointed me as the Prime Minister only after things reached a stage where he had absolutely no other option. When the government is entrusted to me in such circumstances, I cannot in all fairness, shun the responsibility. This was not a question of political power. The fate of our country and the futures of our younger generation were at stake. Furthermore, if after everything was said and done, it was still we who would have to assume that responsibility anyway, there was much to be said for assuming office before further damage was inflicted upon the country.??
?
Since Mahinda was debarred from contesting the presidency, some of Mahinda?s political minions began exploring the possibility of making Mahinda Prime Minister with executive powers
?
This then is the essence of Mahinda Rajapaksa?s explanation of why he chose to grab power so hastily through an unorthodox procedure instead of waiting a little longer to gain power via appropriate channels. According to Mahinda he has done so for the sake of the country and the people. He says he was motivated not by the lure of political power but by a supreme sense of duty and because he was conscious of his responsibilities. President Sirisena was in a difficult situation and turned to him (Mahinda) for help and that was why he took on the responsibility says the ex-president. ?When the government is entrusted to me in such circumstances, I cannot in all fairness, shun the responsibility. This was not a question of political power. The fate of our country and the futures of our younger generation were at stake.? Noble sentiments indeed!?
?
POWER, POSITION, PRIVILEGES AND PERKS?
Although political leaders often claim that they are in politics to serve the people, the reality is something different. One thing we have learnt from past experience is that in Sri Lanka almost all politicians claim to have altruistic motives for doing politics. None of them admits or acknowledges that he is in politics for the pursuit of power, position, privileges and perks of office. Consistency is not necessarily a virtue in politics. Many of them switch sides smoothly whenever it suits them. Avowed policies are altered easily. Their family members and cronies prosper within a short time of a politician getting appointed to an influential post. Political patronage, nepotism and family bandyism are widely prevalent. Political dynasties proliferate. Yet the politicians will continue to repeat ad nauseam that they have dedicated their lives to the people and are making huge sacrifices to uplift the masses. Therefore when politicians say they are accepting office due to patriotic motives , such utterances need to be taken not merely with the proverbial pinch of salt but with a hefty fistful of it.?
So when a veteran politician like Mahinda Rajapaksa says he resorted to a premature power grab for the country and people alone that cannot be accepted immediately at face value. His claims need to be scrutinized more intensely and intricately. Any political analysis of the underlying motives behind Mahinda Rajapaksa?s illegitimate power grab has to delve deeply into recent happenings of a political nature within the Rajapaksa family circle. The turbulent intra-family political currents within the Ruhunu Rajapaksa family and the deterioration of inter-personal relations between President Sirisena and his Prime minister Wickremesinghe need to be examined in detail to comprehend the prevailing political situation and understand - not necessarily accept or condone ? the reasons behind Mahinda Rajapaksa?s impatient power seizure exercise.?
?
A basic undeniable fact of contemporary life in Sri Lanka is the political importance if not supremacy of the Rajapaksas. In that context the succession stakes issue within the Ruhunu Rajapaksa clan plays a pivotal role in the on going political drama
?
A basic undeniable fact of contemporary life in Sri? Lanka is the political importance if not supremacy of the Rajapaksas. In that context the succession stakes issue within the Ruhunu Rajapaksa clan plays a pivotal role in the on going political drama. The ?Medamulana Dynasty? in the Ruhunu Rajapaksa clan comprises the family members of former State Councillor and Parliamentarian Don Alvin (DA) Rajapaksa namely Mahinda Rajapaksa and his brothers Chamal, Basil and Gotabaya along with Mahinda?s son Namal and Chamal?s son Shasheendra. Although the ?Ruhunu Rajapaksa? family has been in politics for several decades, its ascendancy to the pinnacle of power came only after Percy Mahendra Rajapaksa, known to his country and the world at large as Mahinda Rajapaksa, became Sri? Lanka?s fifth Executive President on November 18, 2005.?
?
FIRST FAMILY IN SRI LANKAN POLITICS?
Thereafter, the Rajapaksas established themselves rapidly as the ?numero uno? family in Sri Lankan politics. Apart from Mahinda Rajapaksa as President, family members and extended family members monopolised plum positions. Various posts in different spheres -- from Defence Secretary to diplomatic representative -- were held by the clan. During the days of the Rajapaksa regime it was an open secret that no major enterprise or project could be undertaken in the island without the blessings of at least one Rajapaksa. Nepotism and Family bandyism was a way of life under the Rajapaksa dispensation. The Ruhunu Rajapaksas perceived as the first family in Sri Lankan politics began ruling the roost in an authoritarian mode. With the 18th Constitutional Amendment being passed, the two-term limit for contesting Presidential elections was removed. It appeared that the politically-invincible Mahinda Rajapaksa was set to rule Sri Lanka for life as President.?
When presidential elections were called ahead of time, party secretary and senior Cabinet minister Maithripala Sirisena defected and became the common opposition candidate. The January 2015 Presidential poll resulted in Maithripala Sirisena (51.28%) defeating Mahinda Rajapaksa (47.58%). A UNP-led coalition government was formed with Ranil Wickremesinghe as Prime Minister and Maithripala Sirisena as President. The 19th Constitutional Amendment re-imposing the two-term limit for the Presidency was passed. With Mahinda Rajapaksa being Constitutionally-debarred from contesting the presidency again, it appeared that the political fortunes of Ruhunu Rajapaksas were on the wane. A number of inquiries probing the alleged corruption and abuse of power by various Rajapaksa family members were initiated. Cases were filed in court and a few Rajapaksas like Basil and Namal were even imprisoned for short periods. Gotabaya Rajapaksa continues to wage many legal battles to ward off arrest and possible detention.?
?
Whatever the state of relations between Gotabaya and Namal, Mahinda is too seasoned a politician to let that cloud his judgment or turn hostile to his brother. Mahinda?s primary concern was to recapture power as quickly as possible
?
The 19th Constitutional amendment delivered three blows to the Rajapaksa family. It reversed the 18th constitutional amendment by restricting the Presidential terms of office to two. Since Mahinda Rajapaksa had served two terms as President he was disqualified from contesting the Presidential elections again. This was the first blow. The 19th Amendment also debarred dual citizens from contesting Presidential and parliamentary polls. This rendered Mahinda?s brothers Basil and Gotabaya ineligible to contest as they were US citizens also. This was the second blow. 19A also raised the age limit to be President. Earlier it was 30 but now it was 35. Mahinda?s eldest son Namal Rajapaksa was born in 1986. As such he would only be 33 next year and therefore can?t seek the presidency even if he wanted to. This was the third blow.?
?
SLPP BECAME AN ESTABLISHED POLITICAL ENTITY?
In such a situation, many political observers felt that the writing was on the wall politically for the Ruhunu Rajapaksas. But that did not happen. Despite the adverse setbacks, the political stock of Ruhunu Rajapaksas continued to remain on par with ?Medamulana Mahinda? continuing to retain his position as the single-most popular political leader in the seven provinces outside the North and the East. Moreover, the newly-formed Sri Lanka Podujana Party (SLPP) which revolves around Mahinda Rajapaksa got the better of both the UNP and SLFP and emerged as the leading victor at the local authorities? elections. The SLPP with its symbol of lotus bud became an established political entity known popularly as ?Pohottuwa.? In such a situation the Mahinda-led opposition seemed confident that the days of the Sirisena -Wickremesinghe government were numbered and that the political resurgence and return to power of the Ruhunu Rajapaksas was inevitable.?
Since Mahinda was debarred from contesting the presidency, some of Mahinda?s political minions began exploring the possibility of making Mahinda Prime Minister with executive powers.?
With the newly formed SLPP winning splendidly at the local authority polls it appeared that any candidate with Mahinda?s backing could romp home the winner in the presidential stakes. Thereafter Mahinda would be made prime minister with maximum powers possible. The Rajapaksa camp began asserting boldly that either Mahinda or a suitable person nominated by him would be at the helm of Sri Lankan affairs soon. Although no candidate was openly named, there were organized efforts to prop up Mahinda?s brother and former Defence secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa as the presidential candidate. It was said that Gota would relinquish his US citizenship at the appropriate time and become an eligible candidate. Gota himself began promoting himself indirectly through organizations such as ?Viyathmaga? and ?Eliya.? While the prospect of Gota being Presidential candidate was welcomed by many in the Rajapaksa camp there were some dissidents too particularly within the family circle.?
In an unexpected turn of events, the rising tide of optimism within the Rajapaksa camp started ebbing with distressing news of simmering tensions within the Rajapaksa extended family. Much of this was due to the 19 A ill- effect it was felt. In the absence of Mahinda who among the Rajapaksas could contest the presidential elections? Was the multi-crore question. Though Gota was the front -runner, there was opposition to him too. It was rumoured that Mrs. Shiranthi Rajapaksa and eldest son Namal along with Basil Rajapaksa were not enthusiastic about Gota.
Speculation was rife and the rumour mills began working overtime. The political grapevine began humming with sensational dollops of news about dissension and divisions within the Rajapaksa clan. It was as if the Rajapaksa family was tearing itself apart over the P residential candidacy stakes.?
It was against this gloomy backdrop that the ?Pater Familias? of the DA Rajapaksa family initiated a proactive move to resolve differences and forge unity. Though Mahinda is the most powerful and influential member of the family he is not the head of the family according to socio-cultural norms. In the absence of parents that honour goes to the eldest son in the family. Chamal Jayantha Rajapaksa born on October? 30, 1942 is the eldest of Don Alvin and Dona Dandina Rajapaksa?s nine children comprising six boys and three girls. Mahinda is the third child and second son.?
?
MEETING OF RAJAPAKSA SIBLINGS?
Chamal Rajapaksa arranged for a meeting of the Rajapaksa siblings in March this year. The meeting was held at the residence of one of DA Rajapaksa?s daughters. The Rajapaksa brothers and sisters converged at the venue without their spouses or offspring being present. The objective of the family conclave was to unanimously select an alternative to Mahinda to contest the Presidential elections. The selected candidate would contest polls and hopefully win the elections. Thereafter he would take steps to transfer power back to Mahinda Rajapaksa. The methodology for this would be devised at the appropriate juncture depending upon the prevailing political circumstances and environment. Until such a transfer of power is effected the chosen candidate would abide by Mahinda and be guided by him.?
Chamal Rajapaksa declined to be the chosen candidate. Basil also opted out. This left Gotabaya who was willing. Gota said that he would renounce his US citizenship in due course and that the entire process would not take more than two to three months at the most. Basil also extended his support to Gota and said that he would help him run the government if elected. It was agreed that Mahinda would remain head of the party while Gotabaya would be the presidential candidate. Mahinda also said that it would be premature to announce the candidacy now and said he would do so when the time was conducive. This was agreed upon.?
Thereafter the Rajapaksa family demonstrated through their actions that they were closing ranks. Mahinda and Basil visited Gotabaya?s ?Viyathmaga? office publicly. Gota reciprocated by visiting the SLPP party headquarters officially. The Rajapaksa siblings also re-iterated in media interviews that there was no dissension among them. Everything seemed hunky-dory and it seemed to be only a matter of time before Mahinda would officially announce Gotabaya?s presidential candidacy.?
But then something seemed to have gone wrong with the Rajapaksa family plans and there was soon hidden discord. The family consensus on a presidential candidate did not seem to be valid any more. It appeared that Gotabaya was being opposed within family circles again. Mahinda Rajapaksa?s interview to ?The Hindu? newspaper during his trip to New Delhi in September strengthened this impression further. When Mahinda was asked about the possibility of his brother being a contender at the presidential poll, he did not endorse Gota or anyone else for that matter and instead laid down what could be termed as conditions. He said, ?My brother is certainly a contender, but the party and the coalition will have to decide who the people want?. In replying to a related earlier question Mahinda said, another option is to ?announce a candidate acceptable to all.??
?
PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDACY OF GOTABAYA RAJAPAKSA?
What this meant was that the prospective candidate should be acceptable to a broad constituency and that the decision on a candidate should be endorsed by the Pohottuwa party and the joint opposition coalition. It was well-known that Mahinda had steadfastly refrained from publicly naming his ex-defence secretary sibling as the presidential candidate despite strenuous efforts by the pro-Gota lobby. In the ?Hindu? interview, the conditions stipulated by Mahinda were double-edged as far as Gotabaya Rajapaksa was concerned. Would Gota be endorsed by all shades of opinion in the SLPP and joint opposition? Gota may be acceptable to a large number of Sinhala Buddhists but would he be acceptable to substantial segments of the religious and ethnic minority communities in the Island? If the answers are positive then the presidential candidacy of Gotabaya Rajapaksa would be a certainty. If the answers are negative then there could be no firm decision on Gota being the chosen candidate. This demonstrated reluctance on the part of Mahinda to name Gotabaya as the presidential candidate spoke volumes about intra-family splits and prolonged the prevailing state of uncertainty.?
According to informed sources familiar with inner -currents within the Rajapaksa clan say the family consensus on nominating Gotabaya Rajapaksa as the Presidential candidate did not last long despite the initial euphoria. The main reason according to these sources was that the ?decision? had been taken by the Rajapaksa siblings without the concurrence of their spouses or off- spring. The main obstacle to Gotabaya?s candidacy was Mahinda?s wife Shiranthi and eldest son Namal. They were worried that once the mantle of leadership in the form of the presidency was donned by Gotabaya, the chances of it ever falling upon Namal were remote.?
It was no secret that Uncle Gota and Namal were not well-disposed towards each other. Gotabaya feels that one of the chief reasons for Mahinda losing the presidential poll in 2015 was due to the conduct of his sons notably Namal. Gota in fact had even lost his cool and pitched into Namal in the aftermath of the defeat. Though Namal had kept silent, there are reasons to believe that the nephew had thereafter fought a ?guerilla war? through media circles against Gota?s potential candidacy. It is well -known among journalist circles that many of the ?inspired leaks? in the media that are hostile to Gotabaya can be sourced to the pro-Namal establishment. A controversial incident in this regard was the purported negative remarks made by outgoing US ambassador Atul Keshap to Mahinda Rajapaksa at a one to one meeting about Gotabaya Rajapaksa?s presidential candidacy. It is strongly suspected by concerned parties that circles close to Namal were instrumental in a Northern newspaper scooping the news story.?
?
ELDEST SON NAMAL RAJAPAKSA?S POLITICAL FUTURE?
Whatever the state of relations between Gotabaya and Namal, Mahinda is too seasoned a politician to let that cloud his judgment or turn hostile to his brother. Mahinda?s primary concern was to recapture power as quickly as possible. If Gotabaya was the best possible candidate to spearhead a Rajapaksa renaissance in politics, he was quite prepared to back his brother notwithstanding resentment evinced by Shiranthi or Namal.
Nevertheless as a father, he was very much interested in Eldest son Namal Rajapaksa?s political future. According to unconfirmed reports Mahinda is believed to have asked Gota privately that after becoming president Gotabaya should ensure and guarantee a smooth political passage for Namal Rajapaksa as Gotabaya?s successor if possible. Gota known for his blunt, direct manner of speaking had supposedly refused point blank. The ex-defence secretary had said that no one could guarantee anyone anything in politics. Gota had said it was up to Namal to forge his political future to the best of his ability and that he (Gota) would help him as much as possible but could not and would not provide a fool -proof guarantee. Mahinda apparently was disappointed by this.?
Even if there was cause for Mahinda to be miffed with Gota over the Namal factor it was not that issue which made the ex-president review the family decision to go ahead with Gota as presidential candidate option. Subsequent course of events compelled Mahinda to do a re-think about it. Firstly there was opposition within the Mahinda camp towards Gotabaya?s candidacy. Though Gota had sizable support within the broad folds of UPFA ? SLFP- SLPP combine, there was opposition too. The outspoken comments of Kumar Welgama and Vasudeva Nanayakkara opposing Gota?s candidacy being indicators.?
Furthermore there was Basil Rajapaksa. Although Basil was prepared to abide by the family consensus on Gota many in the SLPP were not prepared to do so. They made this known to Basil effectively and the master political planner who was responsible for the Pohottuwa?s victory at local polls began having second thoughts. There were two concerns. Basil was trying to re-invent the SLPP into an inclusive political party with the aim of wooing the minority communities as it was felt reliance on a sole Sinhala constituency alone was counter-productive politically. There were valid doubts whether Gota could appeal to the non ? Sinhala Buddhist constituency.?
The second concern was about the alternative political apparatus being built up by Gotabaya to mobilise support for him. The vast array of professionals, captains of commerce, former defence service personnel and Buddhist leaders from clergy and laity being engaged in the pro-Gota campaign was impressive. But how was this newly formed alternate power bloc going to fit in with political party formations in the traditional mould like the SLFP, SLPP and UPFA? Was Gota planning to run a presidential administration outside the parliamentary cabinet of ministers??
?
?HITLER-GOTA? REMARKS BY ASGIRIYA ANUNAYAKE THERA?
More importantly the political conduct of some prominent persons supporting Gotabaya and their public utterances were chauvinistically hawkish. Their pronouncements and viewpoints may have titillated ethno-populists and ethno-supremacists within the majority community but aroused fear and loathing among moderates of the majority and minority ethnicities. Gota himself seemed to be unwilling or unable to control these extremist elements. An example being the remarks about ?Hitler - Gota? made by the Asgiriya Anunayake Thera. Under these circumstances there were doubts firstly about Gota winning at the presidential hustings even if he were eligible to contest. Secondly there were misgivings about the forces unleashed by Gota running amok if and when victory was registered.?
Given this conflicting situation Mahinda Rajapaksa seemed to be mulling over the decision to announce Gota?s candidacy publicly. For one thing the presidential poll was due only in 2019 and there was no hurry. But the real reason seemed to be that Mahinda himself was reluctant to make a formal announcement about Gota being the presidential candidate. In spite of many direct and indirect entreaties made by Gotabaya and by others on Gota?s behalf that an announcement should be made ?Mahinda Aiya? was not ready to do so. It was not that Mahinda was opposed to Gota?s candidacy but the ex-president seemed unwilling to do so at this juncture. It was as if he was waiting for the correct time to commit himself or as if he was procrastinating in the hope that a better option may turn up. Gotabaya himself sensed this and was unsure of being nominated as the presidential candidate. Hence, his reluctance to relinquish his US citizenship at this point of time. If he were sure then Gota would have given up his US citizenship promptly. So Gota engaged in the waiting game while promoting his campaign through regular meetings held by organizations and groups affiliated to him.?
Meanwhile events began to overtake. The pace and course of political currents necessitated a drastic alteration of Mahinda Rajapaksa?s plans and objectives. It became importantly imperative for Mahinda Rajapaksa to capture power directly as early as possible. Mahinda could not afford to wait patiently for the 2019 presidential poll. He decided to dispense with the Gotabaya as candidate plan temporarily and instead decided to jump into the fray himself. Mahinda was even prepared to patch up differences with Maithripala Sirisena and form a tactical alliance with the president for this purpose. Earlier Mahinda wanted to split the Sirisena-led SLFP from the so called ?Yahapalanaya? Government and harness enough MPs from all sides to defeat the residual UNF Budget in a Parliamentary vote. Thereafter Maithripala would appoint Mahinda as premier in reconfigured Parliament. However when Maithripala Sirisena for reasons of his own wanted to expedite matters by removing Ranil Wickremesinghe and immediately replacing him with Mahinda Rajapaksa as PM, the ex-president did not want to miss that opportunity.?
?
LULLED INTO A FALSE SENSE OF COMPLACENCY?
Even though he did not have a majority of MPs supporting him in Parliament, Mahinda was prepared to be appointed as premier. Mahinda however was supremely confident that he would be able to get many more than the numbers required within a very short time. For one thing Maithripala had already assured him that the numbers were there pending finalization. Besides flatterers like SB Dissanayake lulled him into a false sense of complacency by telling Mahinda that there would be a landslide of defections from all parties when it became known Mahinda Rajapaksa was the new Prime Minister.?
It is reliably learnt that Basil Rajapaksa cautioned his elder brother about the wisdom of being sworn in as Prime Minister without a viable majority in hand and had suggested that Mahinda wait until the Ranil regime was defeated in the Budget vote and capture power in a more credible and effective manner. But Mahinda would not hear of it. He told his younger brother in Sinhala that power would not come in the way we want or at the time we want and that when an opportunity to seize power loomed large on the political horizon, it should be grasped immediately without delay. It was this line of thinking which resulted in Mahinda Rajapaksa making a power grab through the backdoor. The best laid plans of Mahinda and Maithripala turned awry due to their failure to garner a majority among Parliamentarians. The end result has been a colossal political crisis that has paralysed the nation and made Sri? Lanka an object of scorn internationally.?
Why then did Mahinda Rajapaksa with his years of vast political experience embark upon this risky political venture? What are the reasons and motives that compelled him to opt for a backdoor entry to the seat of power in such a hurry? And where does the current situation leave Gotabaya Rajapaksa? Some of the answers to these burning questions have been touched upon briefly in this article. The issues would be discussed in greater detail in a forthcoming article.??

Nelson Mandela: A revered statesman and global icon
	
?
He negotiated with the apartheid White regime and without bloodshed shared the ruling powers with the White minority, abiding with principles of equal opportunity to all citizens
He adhered to the Constitution of the country to the letter which was adopted in May 1996 by the Parliament of South? Africa and never transgressed any of its clauses to be in power for life
?
During this critical juncture when our country is going through a constitutional crisis, reading about the life of a statesman like Nelson Mandela seems to be an interesting learning experience to us all.?
Five years ago, Nelson Mandela, world renowned African leader, Nobel Peace Prize winner and the first Black President of South? Africa, passed away. Many leaders and representatives from 90 countries attended his funeral. The Blacks who had an overwhelming majority did not have any political right in the apartheid South Africa. Mandela fought for one person one vote and the rights of his brothers and sisters. He was tried unjustly as a terrorist and a political agitator and was imprisoned for 26 years from 1964 to 1990.?
Once released from prison, he negotiated with the White Prime Minster W.F. De Klerk for a democratic Constitution where all citizens would have voting rights. In 1994, Nelson Mandela was elected as the President of South? Africa with an overwhelming majority. He negotiated with the apartheid White regime and without bloodshed shared the ruling powers with the White minority, abiding with principles of equal opportunity to all citizens. Former White Prime Minister W.F. De Clerk became one of the members of his Cabinet.?
Mandela was admired throughout the whole world for the way he negotiated an amicable political settlement with the White supremacists. He was called the Gandhi of modern times and besides the Nobel Peace Prize, he was awarded multiple honours from all around the world including the US Presidential Medal for Peace, Lenin Peace Prize from Russia and Bharat Ratna from India.?
Refused Second Term?
The 1996 Constitution allowed him to run a second term. But in 1997 he resigned from the party leadership and refused to run for a second term. At the time of retirement, the Gallop polls showed 80% support for President Mandela. After retirement, he was active in initiating social activities to uplift the ordinary Black African people. He also raised funds to find a solution to the AIDS epidemic among the Blacks in Africa.
?
He overcame a bout of prostate cancer after retirement, but got respiratory infections at the end of his life and was hospitalised on several occasions. On December 8, 2013 he succumbed to a severe lung infection.?
In 1994 he divulged his political ideology:?
?A friend once asked me how I could reconcile my creed of African nationalism with a belief in dialectical materialism. For me, there was no contradiction. I was first and foremost an African nationalist fighting for our emancipation from minority rule and the right to control our own destiny. But at the same time, South African and African continents are part of the larger world. Our problems, while distinctive and special were not unique, and a philosophy that placed those problems in an international and historical context of the greater world and the course of history were valuable. I was prepared to use whatever means necessary to expedite the erasure of human prejudice and the end of chauvinistic and violent nationalism.??
Lessons we can learn?
The world?s politicians can learn an enormous number of lessons from the life of Nelson Mandela. He was strongly urged by his party supporters not to resign from the party leadership. But he trained two or three younger people in the African National Congress and gave up his leadership to them. He fought and won the democratic rights for his people with patience and sacrifice. He spent 26 years of his life in prison facing harsh conditions because he was convinced about his mission to his people.?
The whole nation and leaders of the other African countries urged him to contest the presidential election at least for one more term. He gracefully rejected to run for a second term. According to opinion polls, 80% of South African people wanted him to contest. He never thought that the survival of the South African democracy depended on him being at the helm of the government. He once said, ?I am not a messiah, but an ordinary man who had become a leader because of extraordinary circumstances.??
He adhered to the Constitution of the country to the letter which was adopted in May 1996 by the Parliament of South? Africa and never transgressed any of its clauses to be in power for life. He respected the Constitution which enshrined a series of institutions to place checks on political and administrative authority within the constitutional democracy. He respected the will of the people both Blacks and Whites in the country.?
He worked hard even after retirement from politics to eradicate the AIDS virus, poverty and hunger from the African continent. From the international monetary awards he received, he created the Mandela Foundation in 1999 based in Johannesburg to focus on rural development of Africans, school construction and combatting HIV/AIDS. He created the Mandela Rhodes Foundation to provide postgraduate scholarships to bright African students.?
He publicly criticized some of the African leaders such as Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe who were holding on to their power.?
He strongly opposed the NATO intervention in Kosovo and the US-UK intervention in Iraq, labelling the Iraqi invasion as a ?tragedy.? A strong follower of Mahatma Gandhi of India and Martin Luther King of America, he gained universal franchise and political freedom for his Black South Africans. His biographers called him, ?one of the most revered persons of our time.? Another called him a ?global icon.?? ? ?

Northern Sri Lanka an important  trade link with China: Archaeologist
	
?
A team of archaeologists from Shanghai? Museum in China recently conducted an excavation mission in Sri? Lanka to find links with the ancient silk route. It happened at a time when China had launched its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) based on the ancient silk route to improve connectivity with the rest of the world. Sri? Lanka is among the countries that pledged cooperation with BRI.?
Chen Jie, who led the five-member team, in an interview with Daily Mirror speaks about the mission and archaeological finds made. He also sheds light on Sri Lanka?s positioning on the ancient silk route. Excerpts:?
?
Q How do you see the positioning of Sri? Lanka in the ancient silk route??
The Maritime Silk Route starts from Chinese coastal ports, extending through Southeast Asian countries to the Indian Ocean, Red sea and then Europe and even East Africa. It has constructed an international network for trade and cultural exchanges, promoting the development of countries along the route. Located at the heart of the Indian Ocean and right in the middle of the sea route between the East and the West, Sri Lanka has played a pivotal role in the maritime trade. Links between Sri? Lanka and China can be traced back to over 2000 years ago. In the 5th century, eminent Chinese monk Fa Xian spent two years in Sri Lanka studying Buddhism. From the 6th century on, exchanges between the two countries have become more and more frequent. Notably in the 15th century, Zheng He?s fleet made several stops in Sri Lanka during his voyages. People from both sides expanded trade and enhanced friendship. The trilingual inscription which was found in Galle in 1911 is important evidence of this milestone.?
From 2018 on, the Sino-Lanka Archaeological Project has been launched through cooperation between the Central Cultural Fund and the Shanghai? Museum. A joint archaeological team has been deployed to explore the economic, cultural and religious exchanges among different countries through excavation and research of the sites and relics related to the Maritime Silk Route in Sri Lanka.?
?
Q What did you discover during excavations??
During August and September this year, the Sino-Lanka Archaeological team started its first mission in Jaffna, the important port city in Northern Sri Lanka. The Allaippitti site in Kayts was excavated while a test-trench was dug inside the Kayts Fort. There are important findings, especially in the Allaippitti site. Quite a number of Chinese ceramics were found, providing significant evidence of the trade links between Sri Lanka and China.?
The excavated artefacts are mainly Chinese ceramics, accompanied by a few local and Southeast or South Asian pottery. The Chinese ware can be dated to the second half of the 11th century and early 12th century, in the late Northern Song dynasty in China.?
The majority of Chinese ware was produced in the coastal areas of Guangdong and Fujian provinces. The most identifiable pieces are products from Chaozhou and Xicun kilns in Guangdong, while a small number of sherds are from Yaozhou kiln in Northern? China. In the late Song period, Guangzhou surpassed ports in Zhejiang and Fujian provinces and became the most important port for overseas trade, which definitely led to the boost of the Xicun and Chaozhou kilns for export porcelain.?
These excavated wares will certainly shed light on the researches of maritime routes, trade network as well as the links between Sri? Lanka and China.?
?
Q What is the special reason for you to undertake your work in Jaffna??
Jaffna is an important port in Northern? Sri Lanka. It is adjacent to the Indian subcontinent and is an important channel for early sea routes. In the past archaeological investigations, many Chinese?
types of porcelain were found in Jaffna, so this area is an important place to understand the early Sino-Lanka relations.?
?
Q How can the two countries cooperate with each other to preserve the archaeological heritage??
Cultural heritage is an historical treasure left by humans in the past. These heritages are important material to understand the interrelationships of early human civilizations, so it is first necessary to recognise their historical values through research.?
With the construction of the city and development of the economy, some cultural heritages are in danger of serious damage. If we do not strengthen the protection of cultural heritage, we will lose them and our memories of history forever. Therefore, we should cherish and care for them together.?
In recent years, China has accumulated a lot of experience in the protection of cultural heritage. If possible, the two countries can cooperate in the protection of cultural relics, the use of cultural heritage and museum management to preserve the heritage of human civilization.?
?
Q What are the areas for further archaeological explorations??
Sri Lanka is an island with many important ports along the coast and a large number of remains associated with the Maritime Silk Road. The joint archaeological team will study the theme of the Maritime Silk Road and carry out archaeological investigations and excavations of relevant port areas. In addition to Jaffna, areas that may work in the future include Trincomalee and Galle.?
?
Q How do you look at the Buddhist lineage between Sri? Lanka and China??
Links between Sri Lanka and China can be traced backed to over 2000 years ago. This fact is not only based on the records of literature, but also confirmed by archaeological findings. Not only in the ports of Sri? Lanka, but also in urban cities like Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa, a large number of Chinese ceramics, coins and other cultural relics have been discovered. These show that Chinese goods have always been very popular products in the maritime silk trade at that time, or in the relationship between China and Sri Lanka.?
The influence of different countries is not one-way. In the long history of exchanges, Sri Lanka?s Buddhist tradition has also had an impact on Chinese religious thought. According to literature, there are Buddhists who came to Sri? Lanka from China like Fa-Xian and Sri Lanka had sent people to China to promote Buddhism.? ?

The world is ending wars Middle-income countries are more warlike than very poor or rich ones
	
?
Democracies do not go to war with each other
Countries most prone to war are not democracies or autocracies, but countries in between
?
We need jaw jaw not war war?, said Winston Churchill rather hypocritically. Still, he would be glad to see that the number of wars around the world has fallen dramatically since the end of World War II, despite the conflicts in Korea, Africa, Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, Lebanon, Pakistan versus India, Central America, Cyprus, ex-Yugoslavia, Syria and now Yemen.
Compared to centuries past this has been a remarkable era, yet one not often acknowledged.
Interstate wars, apart from India versus Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iran and Yemen, have vanished off the map. The wars that remain are civil wars.
The democracies do not go to war with each other, as British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher long ago observed.
A detailed study made by the Economist last month, analyzed all international wars since 1900, along with the belligerents? wealth and degree of development.
It counted all conflicts in which at least 100 people per year were killed, excluding deaths from terrorism, massacres of civilians outside combat, starvation or disease.
The data showed a strong correlation between democracy and peace, with the exception of the US.
The countries most prone to war these days are not democracies or autocracies; they are countries in between.
A similar finding applies to prosperity. Middle-income countries are more warlike than very poor or rich ones.
Why? Wars are expensive, and citizens in tyrannies struggle to organize uprisings. Perhaps a little political competition or wealth makes it easier to take up arms.
The development and growth of international law have undoubtedly had a cooling impact. Grotius, the great Dutch philosopher, wrote in the early 17th century: ?Where judicial settlement ends, the war begins?.
?
The data showed a strong correlation between democracy and peace, with the exception of the US. The countries most prone to war these days are not democracies or autocracies; they are countries?in between
?
To wage war was not a criminal act. It was what States did to uphold the law. Grotius was a clever man but in fact, his writings sanctioned the two terrible world wars.
We now realize that ?legalizing war legitimized violence and blocked routes to peace?, as written by Oona Hathaway and Scott Shapiro in their seminal book, The Internationalists.
It was a successful Chicago Corporate lawyer, Salmon Levinson, who wrote in 1917, ?The only real way to bring an end to the war is to outlaw war?.
All the plans made before assumed the legality of the war. Levinson drew up a plan to outlaw war unlike any other peace plan than under discussion.
Levinson organized a global social movement around the idea of Outlawry. He made an impact. At a special conference in Paris of major countries on August 27th, 1928, the French Foreign Minister Aristide Briand, declared that the day would mark ?a new date in the history of mankind? and the end of ?selfish and willful warfare?.
By signing a treaty, soon to be known as the Kellogg-Briand Pact, the nations of the world would no longer treat war as a lawful means to resolve disputes.
Briand said the treaty would ?attack the evil at its very root? by depriving war of ?its legitimacy?.
That day, 15 nations signed the Peace Pact, and within a year nearly every nation in the world did the same. For the first time in history, a war was considered to be illegal. Tragically, the Pact didn?t survive the pressure of events and the selfish, nationalistic, views of antagonistic countries.
The first challenge came from Japan when it invaded Manchuria in 1931. The League of Nations was paralyzed. The other important institution, the International Court Of Justice, whose charter said that disputes had to be submitted to it, was ignored.
The US Secretary of State, Henry Stimson, started to think about sanctions- ?Sanctions of peace? to replace the ?sanctions of war?. In January 1932 Stimson delivered diplomatic notes to Japan and China, saying, ?The US Government does not intend to recognize any situation, treaty or agreement which may be brought about by means contrary to the covenants and the obligations of the Pact of Paris.?
The League allowed that Japan might take Manchuria but Manchuria would not belong to Japan. Later, other signatories of the Pact- Germany, Japan and Italy- ignored it.
At the end of the Second World War, the United Nations Charter included the words of the Pact verbatim:
?All members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state.? There was one exception- if the Security Council authorized force to keep the peace.
Today we look at a world where territorial conquest has all but disappeared. Immunity for Heads of States no longer exists.
The International Criminal Court can prosecute those accused of war crimes. Before 1928 the average State could be expected to be conquered once in a person?s lifetime. Now, it is once or twice in a millennium.
Progress?
Yes, a lot of it. Most people, especially politicians, are blind to this momentous achievement.?

UNP, JVP mull over impeaching Prez Any compromise on current crisis is a question of pride for UNP,
	
The UNP along with the parties backing it is mulling over the possibility of moving an impeachment motion against President Sirisena (Pic AFP)?
The United National Party (UNP) along with the like-minded parties such as the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP), was upbeat when the Court of Appeal issued an order restraining the Cabinet and Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa from functioning.? ?However, it flew out of the window as President Maithripala Sirisena even discarded its appeal, for the second time, to reappoint UNP Leader Ranil Wickremesinghe as the Prime Minister.? ?
Hot on the heels of the Appeal Court ruling, the UNP representatives hurried to the Presidential Secretariat to engage the President with much hope. They believed the President would be flexible enough to reinstall the UNP-led Government under Wickremesinghe as the Prime Minister.? It proved otherwise as the President, at the very onset, expressed his unwillingness to reappoint Wickremesinghe.?
?Don?t you have any other nominee for premiership other than Mr. Wickremesinghe?? I cannot talk about his reappointment at all,? the President? ? said as he sat down at the negotiation table. It was a shock for the UNP which expected the President to show some flexibility under the present compelling circumstances.?
UNP MP for the Hambantota district Sajith Premadasa was the first to speak out.? He appealed to the President to allow his party to form the Government under Wickremesinghe. ?We have not thought of anyone other than Mr. Wickremesinghe to be our Prime Minister,? he told the President.??
MP Premadasa?s assertion has to be weighed in a context where some MPs of his party try to promote him as the Prime Minister in place of Wickremesinghe.? Probably, the UNP would have requested him to respond to the President in the manner to quell the effect of such rumours circulated in political circles.? According to inside sources, some UNPers such as Ranjith Madduma Bandara and Ashok Abeysinghe openly advocated the premiership for Premadasa.? Be that as it may, Premadasa is not ready for it at this juncture as indicative of his stoic silence on that matter. For him to stake over such responsibilities, he insists that the party leadership? ?be given to him first.
The two higher courts of the country gave rulings against your decisions. It means your actions were unconstitutional. Now, you have to appoint the MP commanding the majority support in Parliament as the Prime Minister
On the other hand, he seems to be having second thoughts on becoming the Prime Minister during this trying time. The country is riddled with issues, and it may be difficult for him to? ?address them by becoming the Prime Minister. Any failure on the part of him would reflect badly on him, and as such he wants to stay away for the time being.? Failure will also spell political doom for him in the long-run.? So, Premadasa?s hands off attitude could be understood.??
Kiriella confronts President
After Premadasa, UNP MP Lakshman Kiriella somewhat confronted the President at Monday?s meeting. ?The two higher courts of the country gave rulings against your decisions. It means your actions were unconstitutional. Now, you have to appoint the MP commanding the majority support in Parliament as the Prime Minister. It has to be the person commanding the majority support. Otherwise, it cannot be done at your whims,? he told the President.
The President turned furious a bit? ? over these harsh remarks by Kiriella. In an equally harsh tone, he responded to Kiriella saying he would not give the premiership to Wickremesinghe even if 225 MPs signed affidavits pledging support to him. Also, All Ceylon Makkal Congress (ACMC) Leader MP Rishad Bathiudeen made a veiled threat to the President. ?Some lawyers say you may end up in jail unless you address this now,? he said.??
As the President refused to budge even an inch from his stance, the UNPers realised that it would be futile to prolong the discussion. As such, they wound up the meeting and walked out of the Presidential Secretariat to be mobbed by the media personnel for comments.??
Question of pride?
Afterwards, on Tuesday evening, the President lashed out? Wickremesinghe publicly at his party?s Convention and reaffirmed his position? ?of not awarding the premiership to him no matter what.? However, the UNP, as a party, is not ready to relent in the face of the President?s tirade.? In fact, it has now turned out to be a question of pride for both the President and the UNP alike.
If the President takes a step back, it would amount to a victory for the UNP. Likewise, it would be a gain for the President if the UNP makes way for the appointment of a new Prime Minister other than Wickremesinghe.? In this manner, it is a tug-of-war which both sides cannot afford to lose at any cost.?
As an affront to the President?s toughened position, the UNP is now contemplating the adoption of a motion in Parliament expressing confidence to Wickremesinghe next week.? Also, the UNP, along with the parties backing it, is mulling over the possibility of moving an impeachment motion against the President.??
Alongside, one would be able to predict how the crisis will end only after the Supreme Court rules on the dissolution of Parliament. If dissolution is affirmed by court, dates will be fixed for the General Elections. In case, dissolution is ruled out, the tussle for power will be intensified with each side trying to rope in members to secure the required majority.? In such an eventuality, an impeachment motion against the President is highly likely.?
TNA in dilemma?
In the midst of such interesting and dramatic political developments in the country, the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) gained influence in Parliament because its numerical strength holds sway in an otherwise hung Parliament.? Alongside, it pledged to support the UNP to form a Government.
TELO, an ally of the TNA, is irked by the TNA?s decision to extend unconditional support to the UNP.? ? It insists that the TNA should get a written commitment from the UNP to address some of the issues confronting Tamil people in the north and the east.?
The representatives of the political parties aligned with the TNA met at the Opposition Leader?s office on Tuesday evening to discuss the situation further.
On behalf of TELO, five members attended it. They are N.Srikantha, M.K. Sivajilingam, K.Karunakaran, Selvam Adaikkalanathan and Vino Noharathalingam. ITAK was represented by its leader Mavai Senathirajah, R. Sampanthan and M.A. Sumanthiran. MP Dharmalingam Sidaththan and S. Ragavan represented PLOTE at the meeting.
TELO put forth five demands to be negotiated with the UNP for a written understanding.? ?They are the release of military-held lands in the north, the repealing of the Prevention of Terrorism Act, the release of LTTE suspects commonly referred to as political prisoners, the implementation of the 13th Amendment in full along with land and police powers and the merger of the north and the east. TELO representatives argued that? ?the TNA should get a commitment from the UNP to implement these five demands. They opined that the successive Sinhala leaders deceived the Tamils right throughout, and therefore no room should be left for it to happen once again.?
If the President takes a step back, it would amount to a victory for the UNP. Likewise, it would be a gain for the President if the UNP makes way for the appointment of a new Prime Minister other than Wickremesinghe.??
However, Sampanthan, as the TNA Leader, was averse to the idea of signing a written agreement. Instead, he said the UNP leadership could be trusted to address these concerns, and therefore a chance should be provided.
Srikantha, a politburo? ?member of the TELO, said it would be unwise for the TNA to antagonise Mahinda Rajapaksa unnecessarily.?
?We should not take sides on this. If we want a political solution, it has to be approved by two-thirds in Parliament. How can we get it without Mahinda?s support? We should not antagonise him too much,? he said. The meeting had ended inconclusively.
EPRLF breaks ranks with TNA
The current? ?political crisis is taking its toll in this way on the TNA. Already, the TNA is challenged by former Northern Province? ? Chief Minister C.V. Wigneswaran who has formed a new party. He has now initiated talks with like-minded political parties in the north to form a new alliance as an alternative to the TNA.?
Already, EPRLF, a long- time ally, has abandoned the TNA and joined hands with the Chief Minister?s party. As a result, the TNA is now an amalgam of three parties only.? So, it won?t be a clean sweep for the TNA next time.?

US resolution condemning Hamas fails to muster required support
	
?
By Carol Morello, Loveday Morris (c) 2018, The Washington Post Dec 07, 2018 - A resolution that would have condemned the militant group Hamas and its attacks on Israel failed to pass the United Nations on Thursday, despite an aggressive campaign by the United States and Israel to cast it as a vote on peace and terrorism.? ?
Nikki Haley, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, argued for a simple majority vote, but a last-minute rule change was passed that foreshadowed the resolution?s failure.? ?
The vote also represented a political disappointment for the Trump administration, which had lobbied hard to get many Arab states to break away from their routine support of the Palestinian position and support the anti-Hamas resolution. But all the Arab states voted against it, even those that have signed peace treaties with Israel.? ?
Their refusal to back the U.S. resolution comes just weeks before the White House prepares to unveil a proposal to get Israelis and Palestinians back to the negotiating table. Support from the Arab states is considered crucial to getting it launched, and the U.N. vote suggests it might get a standoffish reception.? ?
The Kuwaiti representative, speaking on behalf of the Arab bloc, condemned violence and extremism but expressed concern that the U.S. draft resolution skirted any mention of a two-state solution and sought only to condemn one party in the conflict.?

We're opposed to amending 19A: UNP
	
The UNP said yesterday it was opposed to the proposal made by President Maithripala Sirisena to amend the 19th Amendment to the constitution.
UNP MP Ajith P Perera told a media briefing that it was likely that the President had wanted the 19th Amendment to the Constitution changed so as to have the authority to dissolve Parliament at anytime he wished and and to have the authority to appoint, transfer or remove any public officer including police officers.
?The President cannot afford to propose to strengthen the power of the Executive as he received a mandate to abolish the executive presidency and pledged he will serve only a single term as the President of the country,? the MP said. ?Besides we are not prepared nor is there any valid reason to take away the independence of the judiciary and the independent commissions."
He said there was a globally accepted notion that dissolving Parliament any time before its term ends tends to create unrest in a country and dismissed the reports which said his party was planning to select a suitable candidate for the post of prime minister by way of a secret ballot.
?We have already decided that our leader Ranil Wickremesinghe should be appointed as the Prime Minister. Our Deputy Leader will move the confidence vote on December 12 in Parliament. The actions of the President has united all the members of the UNP,? the MP said.? (Yohan Perera)

## Title: Will not  declare snap presidential poll President

Will not  declare snap presidential poll President
	
It was inappropriate to take dissolution of Parliament?to court
	19th A has grey areas in addition to its positive side
	RW arrogated to himself presidential power
	I looked aside as I wanted to be grateful to him
?
?
Ahead of the Supreme Court ruling, President Maithripala Sirisena, in an interview with , speaks about the?steps taken by him to appoint a new Prime Minister and his intentions for the future.?
Excerpts:
?
QAfter you appointed a new government, you spoke with confidence that it would get the required parliamentary majority. It is not so now. What happened actually?
Based on negotiations undertaken by Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa along with the relevant parties, I was informed that it would be possible to muster the support of 113 members. I expressed my views in this regard depending on information fed to me by the relevant parties involved in negotiations only.??
QIn your view, what is the reason for the inability to get the required number at?the end?
It is not a secret that a monetary value descended upon MPs in this exercise. In the actual sense, the price tags were attached to the MPs. It is like tender calling in normal business operations. I personally learnt that some MPs asked for Rs.500 million. I did not talk to anyone personally. In my political career, I have not offered even a petty cash inducement to a local government member at least. I will stick to this principle even in the future.??
If we look at our post-Independence history, we have experience in this regard. We remember how the government of late Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike collapsed in 1964 over the legislation to acquire Lakehouse. I heard that price tags were attached to the MPs for the first time in 1964 when 11 MPs including C.P. de Silva from Polonnaruwa crossed over in a move to topple that government. That is as far as I can remember. I do not know whether any such thing existed before that. Since then, the political crossovers have taken place under different governments.? ?
In 1994, in the event of the elections to the Southern Provincial Council, the members were lured through cash offer inducements in the same fashion.??
Late President R. Premadasa only brought the Act governing the local authorities. Before the enactment of this law, I remember the local government election conducted under the old law in 1969. After that, such elections were conducted under the new law enacted by Mr. Premadasa. The new law rectified all the lacunas previously exploited to financially induce members at local government levels to change parties. Before that, under the old law, Gam Saba members were attached with price tags of Rs.400, Rs.500 or Rs.100 as an inducement to switch sides. I remember vividly how Gam Saba members changed their parties for such cash offers. I remember what happened to the Gam Saba member of our village. People laid siege to his house. The tyres of his vehicles were punctured. In that sense, it is not a novel phenomenon in our country. We have a disgraceful history in this respect.? ?
This time, I heard some bargained themselves for sums as high as Rs.500 million.Mr. Mahinda Rajapaksa could not muster the majority because of such high price tags quoted by the MPs. If not for that, he could have got the majority. Then, the current political turmoil could have been averted well.??
QIn your address to the party convention, you spoke with confidence that the crisis would be resolved within one week?
Yes, definitely.? ?
QHow are going to resolve it in a week?
The Supreme Court was supposed to complete hearing submissions on the court case in this regard by December 7. The ruling will be delivered by Monday or before. That is what I believe. I gave my assurance according to this belief. The ruling regarding the dissolution of Parliament will clear the air for everything to settle. It will end the crisis. If the court rules in favour of dissolution, there will be an election. Then, the problem is over. Otherwise, I will have to afford the opportunity for the party with majority support in Parliament to form the government under someone handpicked by me as the Prime Minister.? ?
QYet, you said you would not give premiership to UNP leader Ranil Wickremesinghe at any cost. The UNP insists that it will nominate only Mr. Wickremesinghe to the post. Then, it will lead to further stalemate. Won?t it?
I have categorically stated that I am not ready at all to appoint someone, unfit for the country, and corrupt, as the Prime Minister. I have not changed my stance.??
QThen, is it possible for you to handpick someone other than him?
Why can?t I do it? There are 224 others other than Mr. Wickremesinghe. Can?t these political parties identify even a single MP other than Mr Wickremesinghe???
QIn your speeches in the past, you always said that you had won over the world. You said Sri Lanka had only friends, no enemies in the world. But, your action for the change of government is criticized by the western envoys. What will happen to the international trust you built?
No envoy has threatened us. There is no undue influence or pressure on us. They expressed their opinions. They held talks with us. Whenever I called for a meeting, they participated in it. They met me individually or as a group. They expressed themselves. I put forth my position. It is a feat of democracy as I can see. The media have played it up as a huge crisis. These are not serious matters in my view.??
QWhen you defected from the Mahinda Rajapaksa government in 2014, you made a scathing attack on him. You joined hands with the UNP leadership. Today, you say Mr. Rajapaksa is even better than Mr. Wickremesinghe. What is the reason for your change of attitude?
I will refer to a rural proverb. The true colours of a bird become visible only when it takes flight. It is the same story with Mr. Wickremesinghe. The true nature of Mr. Wickremesinghe also became apparent only after he took over power.? ?I never thought Mr. Ranil Wickremesinghe would be such a person- stubborn, adamant, and not ready for dialogue or to listen.??
Mr Wickremesinghe makes a hue and cry about democracy. But, he is the person who ruled out democratic space within the UNP for the last 25 years. During the last four years, he arrogated to himself the presidential powers in addition to being the Prime Minister. I maintained silence in the face of such actions as I wanted to be grateful to him.? ?
He arrogated to himself some presidential powers on matters such as bilateral agreements with other countries, diplomatic engagements, agreements with the foreign leaders, and foreign investment.? ?According to the Constitution, the President has the sole authority on land power. Without my authorization, he proceeded with the Hambantota Port deal and the Free Trade Agreement with Singapore.? ?
During my election campaign, I, along with him and others, said that the work on the Port City project would be suspended. After the election, Mr. Wickremesinghe, without consulting me, contacted the project company and suspended the work. He never discussed terms and conditions reached with the company for suspension of work. After a few months, again without consulting me, he gave the go-ahead for the project on fresh terms. It is impossible to reach any agreement with a foreign investor on land matters without authorization by the President.??
QDoes it mean that he acted as if there was no President for the country?
He acted as if there was no President for the country. He sometimes worked virtually putting me in the shoes of a local government member, let alone the President.??
I have already said that I will appoint a presidential commission to probe frauds and malpractices during the past three and a half years. It will have an important job in investigating such frauds, malpractices, improper transactions and decisions taken on the contrary to the provisions of the Constitution.? ?When the Central Bank bond fraud was probed, there was undue influence on the investigative officers. In fact, those investigative officers came under scrutiny. A number of institutions such as the Criminal Investigation Department (CID), the Police Department and the Attorney General?s Department conducted investigations.?
?
The CID officers involved in probing the bond fraud, were subjected to inquiries on the charge that their actions amounted to harassment of Mr. Wickremesinghe. These officers got intimidated as a result, and investigations were crippled. The officials who were otherwise conducting investigations enthusiastically became discouraged.? ?As a person who was close to both Mr. Mahinda Rajapaksa and Mr. Ranil Wickremesinghe, I know the characteristic differences of the two. In a family, only the husband and the wife know their compatibility with each other.??
I have a long-standing political relationship with Mr. Mahinda Rajapaksa. I had political contact with Mr. Wickremesinghe for four years. I know both well.? ?
QHow do you compare and contrast the two? I am asking that question because you said you would end up buried six feet under the earth if Mr. Rajapaksa won. Today, you say Mr. Rajapaksa is better than Mr. Wickremesinghe
As I said at that time, I would have ended up buried six feet under the earth. However, my motherland would have been buried without any trace, in the manner Mr. Wickremesinghe worked. It is far more dangerous to see my country being obliterated from the world map virtually.??
QWith the enactment of the 19th Amendment, you lost some authority as the President. Especially, you lost the power to dissolve Parliament after one year. You would have been on a strong footing in dealing with the current crisis if not for that. Do you regret the enactment of the 19th Amendment?
No. It is a positive piece of legislation. It is absolutely essential for the country. It strengthened the democratic institutions of the country. It upheld human rights and ensured judicial independence. We have to protect the 19th Amendment.??
Yet, there are some grey areas in it triggering political concerns. For example, today?s Parliament is a hung Parliament. No one has a clear-cut majority. It is a reason for this political crisis to prolong. It is difficult for a party to take decisions under these circumstances.??
If the power to dissolve Parliament were retained, it would have been better to deal with the current crisis. People have to decide. It is their right. Today, price tags are attached to MPs. As a result of this crisis, some MPs got BMW cars as inducements. They drive them without number plates these days. They got new vehicles. The credibility of some MPs has suffered. The party leaders cannot take a decision. The MPs come out with their personal concerns such as the loss of their pension rights in the event of dissolution of Parliament. They are least bothered about the plight of the country. They must be ready to make a sacrifice for the country.??
It was inappropriate for anyone to go to court against the dissolution of Parliament in a crisis situation like this. I will not comment on whether the judiciary can rule out dissolution or not. Be that as it may, the Legislature and the Executive should have been able to resolve this crisis without going to court. If this case was not taken to court by anyone, the current crisis would have been solved by now.??
Today, if I call for a meeting with any leader, he will come. We have political issues, but not personal animosities. We discussed the issue at length. We must recognize that democratic ambience and be happy about it.??
As the matter was taken to court, we lost the opportunity to resolve it within the democratic ambience. If the matter is referred back for us to resolve, I think it will be better. These are not criminal cases. This is a political question. It has to be addressed politically. The political leaders should have wisdom and magnanimity for it. Law is above anyone.??
?
The complications in the 19th Amendment are a hindrance to resolve this matter.? ?
We remember the day it was enacted. The vote was taken up at 5.00 pm. It lasted for long hours. The problems that arose during the process were addressed through hurriedly conducted meetings. The parliamentary session was conducted under a tense atmosphere. There was no opportunity to give careful and peaceful thought on matters at hand. That is how a piece of legislation detrimental to the future of the country, was enacted.? ?
QWas there a need to enact it hurriedly?
I do not think there was such a need to rush through. Actually, Mr. Ranil Wickremesinghe, along with a few others who assisted him, is responsible for the hurried enactment of it leading to the present crisis.??
QDespite the Executive and the Legislature being involved in a crisis, normalcy prevails in the country. People get on with their lives without any tension among them over the crisis. What is your view on it?
It is definitely correct. I will add something to your question. There is no Prime Minister. There is no Cabinet. However, the President governs the country together with the Ministry Secretaries under the blessings of the Triple Gems. There are no clashes in the country. That is because of the moral discipline of our people. Despite skullduggery and idiocy among politicians, people have put the country before self. They carry on their routine activities peacefully. This is the moral discipline of our people nurtured by the Buddhist culture and values for millennia.? ?
Also, the spirituality of Christianity, Hinduism and Islam contributed to the moral conduct of their followers in our country. People of all these religious groups have regards for the country.??
I am very happy about it. People have cooperated with me in the conduct of governing affairs with the Ministry Secretaries. I am grateful to people for it.??
QThe UNP calls for an early presidential election. It is possible only if you become the candidate. Are you ready?
?I am not ready to work according to the political agendas of others. My official term will end next year. Then, there will be a presidential election for sure. If there is a snap presidential election, only I have to declare it. I have no intention of declaring such a presidential election. I am not ready to fall in line with the political agendas of the others.? ?
QAre you planning to run for presidency for the?second term?
There is one more year for it to be decided. There is no need to decide on it now. If you look at the past one month, politics was riddled with happenings on an hourly basis. As media personnel, you all have so many news stories. That is what happened during the past five weeks. Who could say what will happen in a period of one year from now on? We cannot say it now.??
QWhen you defected from the last government, you were harshly critical of former Minister Basil Rajapaksa. Now, we see reports about you having meetings with him. How is chemistry between you and?him now?
The Indo-China border war in the 1960s claimed so many lives in the 1960s. The leaders of those two countries were able to sit together. We are familiar with decisions taken by the political leaders to address disputes involving Diego Garcia islands.??
As for our Kachchaithivu issue, Mrs. Bandaranaike and Indira Gandhi addressed it after five-minute talks.??
In politics, there are no permanent enemies or friends.??
QHow do you see the role of the Speaker during this critical time?
The MPs hold different views with regard to his conduct. After this crisis erupted, I was able to meet with him and discuss it on several occasions. He came to see me here. Likewise, I contacted him over the phone. We were able to resolve so many issues. We were able to do it using our political maturity, knowledge and experience. If others, especially Mr. Ranil Wickremesinghe can behave in the way we did, this problem could have been addressed easily.? ? ?
