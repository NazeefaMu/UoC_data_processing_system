Myths and Misconceptions about Kuja Dosha
	

Some of our readers, at least those who happened to read the Part 1 of this article that appeared in the Jyotisha page last week may know now that Mars occupying the 1st, 2nd, 4th, 7th, 8th or the 12th House in a Natal Chart of an individual causes Kuja Dosha which is also widely known as Mangalik Dosha and Bhauma Dosha.

Rashi misinterretation
It is a matter for regret that there appear to be many astrologers in this country who would quickly pronounce the presence of Kuja Dosha the moment they notice that Mars is placed either in the 1st House or the 7th House without analyzing the horoscope in its entirety to ascertain whether there are planetary combinations that nullify or dilute the effect of Kuja Dosha in each case.

Is half the world population Mangalik
In this context, this writer would like to recall a very valid point that an eminent astrologer has made to demonstrate the fallacy of attributing Kuja Dosha to every case where Mars is positioned in the 1st, 2nd, 4th, 7th, 8th or the 12th House in a horoscope.
It goes without saying that Mars being one of the planets in Astrology should occupy one of the 12 Houses in a horoscope. This eminent astrologer says that his calculation is that Mars by being in one of those Houses affects five persons out of every 12 which means Dosha afflicts about 42 percent of the world population at a given moment. He adds that if the Houses to be affected are reckoned from the Moon sign as well, the figure supposed to be liable to get affected will rise to 52 percent which works out to more than half the world population. He asks whether it is rational to believe that the Kuja Dosha ruins the marriage of more than half the world population!

Kuja Dosha not a myth either
The astrologer says that he would not dare make a sweeping statement that there is no affliction called Kuja Dosha. He adds that though there is a malefic yoga called Kuja Dosha, there are many planetary combinations capable of nullifying or diluting this Dosha. In fact, the sages in ancient India such as Parasara and Jaimini have explained those combinations in theircelebrated works.

What Mars represents
A negative Mars or a malefic Mars causes anger, intolerance, harsh speech, aggressiveness and tendency to destroy things. However, a positive Mars gives courage, boldness, drive, energy, leadership qualities and executive skills among other things.

What the Houses represent
The 7th House in a horoscope represents marriage, spouse, sex drive and partnerships and the 8th House life after marriage and the longevity of the spouse. The 2nd House which is called Kutumbhasthana denotes the married life of a couple, the 4th House which is called Gruhasthana the family life settled in a permanent residence. The 12th House denotes the status of physical love.

Rationale for Kuja Dosha
Mars commands full aspect over the 4th, 7th and the 8th Houses from its own position. Therefore, a malefic Mars can spoil these three Houses in addition to the House it occupies.
Success of marriage depends on mutual love, tolerance and sacrifice and a malefic Mars could destroy all these attributes with its bad temperament, intolerance and aggressiveness leading to constant quarrels, clashes and unhappiness. This is Mars blemish or Kuja Dosha!
There are numerous planetary combinations that nullify or dilute Kuja Dosha. Therefore, one should not hasten to pronounce the presence of this Dosha just going by the basic definition.However, one may ascertain the dignity of the 7th House and the 8th House and their lords and the Moon and Venus for making a gainful snapshot judgment about the existence of Kuja Dosha.

Nalaka de Silva arrested over plot to kill an ASP: Police
	
Ex-TID DIG Nalaka de Silva was arrested in connection with the alleged plot to kill ASP Prasanna Alwis and not in connection with the alleged plot to assassinate President Maithripala Sirisena and Gotabaya Rajapaksa, Police Spokesman Ruwan Gunasekara said.
The CID arrested Nalaka de Silva on Thursday and he was remanded till November 7 by Colombo Fort Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne in connection with the alleged plot to assassinate several VIPs.
SP Gunasekara told a news briefing today that the former DIG was arrested under the provisions of the Penal Code and the Prevention of Terrorism Act.
Although the statements made by Namal Kumara to the CID included an alleged plot to assassinate President Maithripala Sirisena and Gotabaya Rajapaksa, the six voice cuts obtained by the CID were in no way connected to the plot to assassinate them, he said. It is only through the investigations carried out by the CID that the plot to kill ASP Prasanna Alwis was revealed and no evidence found in any of the voice cuts."
SP Gunasekera said they would continue to investigate whether there was any plot to assassinate the President and Mr. Rajapaksa.
The CID launched investigations into the assassination plot on September 14. The CID has recorded statements from 89 people including two SSPs and 47 police personnel, he said and added that the CID would seek the assistance from overseas to recover the voice recordings which were reportedly deleted by Namal Kumara.

Need is South Asian outlook; not Global
	
The economy should be geared for the South Asian market and not to the global market -the fly bynight investors

Last week, no less a person than the most trusted ally of President Sirisena, the General Secretary of the UPFA Minister of Agriculture Mahinda Amaraweera said there were four RAW agents in the Cabinet, whose names would be exposed in due time.
Wonder why RAW would want to spend on four moles in the Cabinet when one or two at the most can tell them all that they wish to hear at half the cost.
The General Secretary of President Sirisenas SLFP Minister Duminda Dissanayake said, people didnt deliver on their responsibility in Sri Lanka, but did others work.
Addressing a gathering in Thalawa he said, that politicians turned to singers, singers advice on business, doctors advice on economy and monks advice on politics.
Theres no way forward unless we do, our part of the job, he said.
Elections Commission Chairman Mahinda Deshapriya has sent a strong letter to the Government and registered political parties alleging, the Government not deciding to hold PC elections allowed a dictatorial rule in the Provinces through the bureaucracy.
PM Wickremesinghe speaking to new GS Niladhari appointees had said, Sri Lanka would be better off by National New Year 2019.
Thats just four months away. Meanwhile, the rupee further depreciated and is around Rs.173 per US dollar, expected to hit the 200 rupees low by Christmas.
Verite Research, a Colombo based research and think tank, announced that the 2018 Budget had failed to deliver on its proposals during the past six months.
Of the 38 proposals we were tracking, only 50 percent had action plans or progress reports that were released by relevant agencies, said Verites Research Director Subhashini Abeysinghe.
It was said, the undisclosed proposals that totalled Rs. 45 billion, included proposals for education reforms, urban regeneration and establishment of medical faculties in three Universities.
Tuesday last, former MP Kesaralal Gunasekere, wrote to the Daily Mirror an article headlined Get the country back on track.
Gunasekeres opening lines are worth quoting.
We are going through a very critical phase in Sri Lanka. The country needs immediate measures to put things back on track, which will give short and long-term lasting resultsmindful that our programmes MUST give results, which benefit all citizens, and not just a fewFor example, we are all well aware, that the airport in Mattala, the port in Hambantota, the Convention Centre in Hambantota and even the Uma Oya-project in the Uva Province have not given us the expected results.
This is a glimpse of whats happening around us. The political leadership crisis in Government, lack of a clear vision for the future, the total absence of proper planning, reckless Governance without direction, pathetic inefficiency in State administration topped up with continuing corruption and fraud, completes the extremely unpleasant picture three years plus after Rajapaksa was ousted.
Within this chaos, all major projects that Gunasekere has listed and has not, are mega deals- no doubt-packed with heavy corruption.
They were used against the Rajapaksa leadership during the two elections in 2015. In the year 2015, we saw many anti-corruption leaders popping up in Colombo, with numerous name boards doling out information on mega Rajapaksa corruptions to the media, almost every day.
Three years and 10 months after the 2015 Presidential Election, Mega Rajapaksa corruption is no more the sustaining factor of this extremely difficult Yahapalana co-habitation.
None of the big sharks they named during the elections has been booked to date with convincing and firm evidence.
Then came the case against Johnston Fernando and two officials, who were tried for misappropriating Rs.5.2 million.
All were acquitted by the Kurunegala High Court Judge Ms Menaka Wijesundera on lack of credible evidence. This took steam off from all anti-corruption campaigns the JVP, the Colombo Yahapalana apologists and the actor, deputy minister cum publicist Ranjan Ramanayake were politically living on.
Meanwhile, the UNP leadership has not been able to climb out of the Bond Scam debris, with Arjun Aloysius and Palisena still in remand prison.
Latest is State Minister Senasinghe alleged of fiddling with the high-speed railway project, while there are questions over BOI itself over decades.
He was pitifully stuck in the stinking pit of the Bond Scam too.
There are many others in the UNP who are very much in business.
Now coming back to Gunasekeres lament to have the country back on track, the most important question is, which track should we get back to
This country can never be put on its feet unless development is redefined within a paradigm shift in economic policy and strategy to benefit all citizens and not just a few as requested by Gunasekere.
Sadly, all who want to have the country back on track, dont question the filthy role of the free market economy that creates this chaos.
The free market economy can never be packaged without corruption and cannot be designed for the benefit of all citizens.
In fact, free markets are never designed and planned. They are exclusively urban markets, left open with the role of the State switched to facilitate a free for all, with the filthy rich collecting all profits.
It is not about who runs the Government. The next man or woman who sits on the saddle after the 2020 Presidential Election would be no better. Perhaps, would be far worse. Be it Rajapaksa, Sirisena or Wickremesinghe, corruption is what FDI projects for export production thrive upon in these free markets.

"Country can never be put on its feet unless development is redefined within a paradigm shift
None of the big sharks they named during elections has been bookedto date"
Chinese, Indian and all other investors come here to hoard big money in double quick time with massive State concessions, at the expense of the taxpayer.
This has been no different in Malaysia, in the Maldives, in Bangladesh, Pakistan and in all places where free markets and investments decide what development is. In free markets, big money that comes and goes does not take People into account and People are not necessary except as cheap, unorganized labour.
From the Hambantota Port, through Mattala Airport, the International Convention Centre, the Colombo Port City to the once sweetly sung Megapolis Development, is not a development the people need and a necessity for the people.
Thus, nothing has changed, though the Presidency and the Government did from Rajapaksa to Sirisena-Wickremesinghe.
It was just that with Yameen and China in the Maldives and Razak and China in Malaysia.
In Malaysia, it took a 93-year-old man to come back and tell what went wrong and what goes wrong.
We do not want a situation where there is a new version of colonialism happening because poor countries are unable to compete with rich countries, said Mahathir Mohamad, recently re-elected Prime Minister of Malaysia at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing after meeting with Chinese Premier Li Keqiang. (NYT- 20 Aug. 2018)
Concluding a five-day visit, the NYT reported, Mahathir Mohamad said on Tuesday that he was halting two major Chinese-linked projects, worth more than $22 billion, amid accusations that his predecessors Government knowingly signed bad deals with China to bail out a graft-plagued State Investment Fund and bankroll his continuing grip on power.
Quoting Mahathir Mohamad, the NYT said:
Its all about borrowing too much money, which we cannot afford and cannot repay because we dont need these projects in Malaysia.
He had earlier suspended the projects, leading some analysts to believe he wanted to renegotiate the terms during his China trip. Instead, he announced that the deals were off, for now, wrote NYT.
This is quite a contrast to how the Sirisena-Wickremesinghe leadership handled the Rajapaksa-China projects they vowed would be scrapped when voted to power.
Hambantota Port deal was renegotiated and left with the Chinese for 99 years, as good as lifetime ownership.
The controversial Colombo Port City was renegotiated too and now the Chinese company has a 99-year lease there as well, and extended reclaimed land with law unto themselves.
Apart from losing jobs to cheap South and South East Asian labour, we are also getting socio-culturally entrenched with South East Asian ethnic labour and more with Chinese and Indian labour on long-term projects allowed to bring their own men.
This, in contrast to Mahathir Mohamads vision for the future that seeks to have a people-centred regulated economy, is one that is being opened up more and more, leaving all decisions to foreign investors; what to invest on and manufacture for big profits, where to invest on, from where the labour is and at what wage and working conditions, for profits they decide. Thus this is a free market economy that does not give us space and opportunity to define our own destiny.
We have thus not learnt during the 40 years since we opened up our economy, that our economy should be geared for the South Asian market and not to the global market the fly by night investors produce to earn big profits for themselves.
With India next door having many economically growing Federal States like Tamil Nadu and SAARC as a regional collective, regional affiliations can be our pedestal for growth, economically and culturally.
It is time we start discussing Sri Lanka within South Asian Development with mechanisms to safeguard human rights, a functional regional democracy and a regional economy that can collectively benefit SAARC countries.

New constitution: Second interim report on Nov. 7
	
The second interim report of the new constitution is to be presented to the Constitutional Assembly by the steering committee on Nov. 7, top government sources said yesterday.
A senior official attached to the Constitutional Assembly told Daily Mirror that a document was due to reach them on November 7, but declined to reveal what the document would be.
However, the Daily Mirror learns from reliable sources that the document referred to is the second interim report on the new constitution. The dates for debate on the report will be decided later according to sources.
The first interim report was presented to the assembly on September 2017 and did not get a favourable response with some political parties who are allies of the government also opposed to parts of it.
A key ally of the government opposed the abolition of Executive Presidency while the nature of the State was opposed by both the opposition and several allies of the ruling coalition.
The report also received criticism from the Mahanayakas of the Asgiriya and Malwaththa Chapters.
The move comes despite the 20th Amendment to the Constitution seeking the abolition of Executive Presidency being presented in Parliament by the JVP. (Yohan Perera and Ajith Siriwardana)

Plans, expert solutions, suggestions gather dust... but Metal monsters continue to slaughter  wild e
	
There are much deliberations at high places by many experts to find a solution to the carnage that is taking place on the rail tracks, while wild elephants succumb to gruesome deaths at an alarmingly rapid rate. In typical Sri Lankan style there are committees appointed to study and report on the issues, (when the facts are too well known) and then when the report is submitted it will gather dust on some shelf somewhere. 
When there is a serious issue at hand, those of us who have been in the upper levels of private sector management do well know, that wide consensus-based decision-making is not the best idea under the circumstances. The need of the hour is to take swift decisions, the best decisions under the circumstances, and to immediately mitigate the crisis. It may not be the best solution, but to stem the rot, something needs to be done fast and effectively, and this calls for swift decisive actions, without wasting time on prolonged discussions. 
In the same manner what is needed in this case also is to take stock of the present situation, and come up with a simple, effective and readily implementable solution fast. 
So lets take stock of the current situation: 

"The best decisions under the circumstances, is to immediately mitigate the crisis. It may not be the best solution, but to stem the rot, something needs to be done fast and effectively, and this calls for swift decisive actions, without wasting time on prolonged discussions"
 The deaths are occurring on certain stretches of the railway tracks predominantly. These areas are readily known to the scientific community doing research on elephants. (e.g Palaugaswewe, Welikande areas) 
 These areas cover stretches of several km of the track at specific places 
 The deaths occur predominantly at night 
 Having the engine drivers slow down when close to these areas is not a realistic option. It just does not happen. (this solution has been tried for several years, with sign boards warning drivers to slow down. But due to indiscipline and negligence, and the usual Sri Lankan style of lack of application and follow up and inability to implement a decision, it ended as an utter failure). 
 Similarly installing high-tech solutions (such as thermal imaging) is of no use because the drivers do not generally heed the warnings. 
 Deploying a wildlife warden to travel in the locomotive also has its downside, as it is not clear whether the warden would have the authority over the engine driver to enforce a slow drive. 
Given these constraints, the only logical short-term solution has to be an early warning system to frighten off the elephants, triggered automatically by the approaching train. This would take away all the unreliable human invention variables that form the equation. 

	Strobe lights are considered the best way to frighten the beasts
	
	
	HEC is the result elephants losing their habitat and coming into contact with humans more than before
	
	
	Elephant deaths occur predominantly at night
	
	
	Elephants hear low frequencies better than high frequencies
	
So, with this in mind, I greased the rusty cog wheels of my early engineering training and came up with a simple, effective, relatively cheap idea that may be worth considering. (My in-plant training at the signals division of the railways many moons ago, did help)! 
The early warning system is a wired electrical alarm triggered by the loco itself. It sounds an audible and visual (strobe lights) alarm some 1.5-2.0 km ahead of the train, to frighten off elephants in the vicinity of the tracks.The triggering device could be a simple proximity switch by the side of the track, or a pressure switch embedded in the track (or other similar device). 
The wiring circuit could be run along the track to the point ahead where the alarm is installed. The alarm itself could be a low frequency powerful horn (elephants hear low frequencies better than high frequencies) and a set of multiple strobe lights mounted on a mast. 
The electrical power required for the entire system for 2 strobes (500 Watt/sec) and one powerful alarm, will require about a total of 1.5 to 2.0 kw of power (according to my rusty engineering knowledge). In some areas there is grid electrical power available. If off grid, a solar panel array coupled with a battery bank could also be used. This has to be sized so that there would be sufficient power stored for the system for one whole night or more (allowing for overcast days where charging is slower during the day). 
My basic calculations indicate that each unit would cost in the range of Rs.1.5 m and several such units have to be installed along the length of the track. As the train passes, it would trigger different track circuits along the stretches that are known elephant crossing areas. The system is easy to install, not hi-tech, and relatively less expensive. 

"The early warning system is a wired electrical alarm triggered by the loco itself. It sounds an audible and visual (strobe lights) alarm some 1.5-2.0 km ahead of the train, to frighten off elephants in the vicinity of the tracks"
I am not for one moment suggesting that this is a fool proof method that will work. A few pilot systems have to be installed and tested out. In fact some of the elephant experts whom I talked to say that over time, the elephants (that are very intelligent animals) would get used to the alarm and would not move away. 
In the absence of any quick do able solutions, maybe something like this needs to be triedwhile the longer term, more permanent solutions are debated and implemented. We owe it to ourselves to do something fast. At least to try and do something. 
Of course the root cause is a much larger and complex issue. The Human-Elephant Conflict which is the result of elephants losing their habitat and coming into contact with humans more than before. A few weeks earlier while on a drive to the east coast I saw seven elephants at the height of mid-day, by the road side in the Habarana area, some soliciting food from passers-by. A decade ago one would have seen elephants on the road only late in the night.With dwindling food sources and habitat, the elephants are now venturing out into human territories. 
The solutions to the Human-Elephant Conflict are very complex, and needs a holistic national effort to mitigate. Alas that is but a pipe dream. 
As Dr. Upatissa Pethiyagoda so aptly says until We are the intruders and we deserve to honour both human rights and elephant rights. As a tourist attraction, they may have already paid for their keep, and it is time for us to reciprocate. He goes on to say that we have to put the elephant first, and that we should not call it the Human-Elephant Conflict, but on the contrary call it the Elephant-Human Conflict! Until there is such a paradigm shift in our thinking nothing can be done. 

"Up to October 15 this year, some 225 elephants have died. This translates into about 5 deaths per week! And thats only the number that is recorded. What about the elephants that die inside jungles which are not accounted for"
Today elephants are dying at an alarming rate (not only due to train accidents). It is reported that up to October 15 this year, some 225 elephants have died. This translates into about 5 deaths perweek! And thats only the number that is recorded. What about the elephants that die inside jungles and are not accounted for 
Can we afford to sit back and watch Sri Lankas bountiful nature be ravaged and decimated before our eyes

SL Commander in Mali - We're not responsible for his recall: HRCSL
	
The Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka (HRCSL) yesterday categorically rejected allegations of being responsible in any manner for the UN request for the repatriation of Lt. Col. Kalana Amunupura, the Commander of the Sri Lankan Military Contingent deployed in Mali as part of the UN Peacekeeping Mission.
"With reference to the Daily Mirror article titled, 'UN request to withdraw the Commander, Prez expresses concern, has misgivings about the role played by the HRCSL," Chairperson Dr. N.D Udagama," said in a statement.
"HRCSL vetting was suspended pursuant to a letter dated May 23, 2017 sent to the Commission by the then Army Commander Major Gen. Krishantha Silva, stating that the entire contingent to be sent to MALI for peacekeeping purposes has been vetted by the UN and that vetting by HRCSL was not required. HR vetting in regard to the military contingent for UN Peacekeeping to MALI was carried out by the UN and is a fact known to all parties concerned.
"In fact, we note that Lt. Col. Amunupuras name was not in the list of names sent by the SCA to the HRCSL on January 25, 2017 for vetting.
"We note that the Daily Mirror news item captioned Lt. Col. Amunapura recalled from Mali, published in todays Daily Mirror (26th October, 2018) which reports that the Sri Lanka Army has confirmed that the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka (HRCSL) was in no way involved in the decision to recall Lt. Col. Kalana Amunupura," the statement said.

Sports club prefers serving drinks  to sport
	
In the Heritage City of Kandy most clubs have violated the Cultural Triangle laws and operate as private clubs showing no interest to be involved in sport. As a result of the questionable activities of these clubs all ethnic groups are showing concern and raised objections over a certain sports club in the vicinity of the Temple of the Tooth in Kandy. This club does not indulge in any sports activity, but is very active when it comes to the sale of liquor and renting out rooms for personal engagements. The talk of the town is how they renew their liquor licenses This is despite strict laws being present. There is little regard to the fact that the Junior School of Mahamaya Girls College is situated next to a club. A few yards away there is D.S.Senanayakle College and Dharmaraja College and opposite the club there is a Nursing home. Its a matter to be concerned because the Maligawa is just a five minutes away from the club.
The club officials are promoting the place saying that though this is not a five star property it is the best place to break rest and then visit Kandy. Its a 5-8 minute walk to the Kandy City Center from the club. The place still has a lot of colonial charm. Pictures portraying British history still avails itsself on the walls of the club.
Whats shocking is that the Excise Department renews the clubs liquor license despite there being no sports at this institute. Sports lovers of Kandy wish that this matter gets the attention of the two Mahanyakes, the President and Prime minister.

Two Pakistanis who swallowed heroin capsules arrested
	
Two Pakistan nationals, a man and a woman, were arrested by the Police Narcotics Bureau at the BIA while arriving in Sri Lanka from Lahore after swallowing heroin capsules yesterday afternoon, Police Spokesman SP Ruwan Gunasekara said.
He said the suspects were admitted to the Negombo General Hospital. So far, 35 heroin capsules have been found from the stomach of the woman and none from the male suspect.

What you should know about Psoriasis
	
Skin Conditions occur due to various reasons and psoriasis is one of them. According to the International Federation of Psoriasis Associations (IFPA), more than 125 million people around the world are living with a psoriatic disease thereby making it a global concern. World Psoriasis Day falls on October 29 and this years theme focuses on treating Psoriasis seriously as it may affect patients in many ways. Hence we spoke to Consultant Dermatologist Dr. Nayani Madarasingha who shed light on the causes, symptoms and treatments of this condition.

What is Psoriasis
Psoriasis is a common skin condition that speeds up the life-cycle of skin cells. It causes cells to build up rapidly on the surface of the skin. The extra skin cells form scales and red patches.
Psoriasis is a chronic disease that often surfaces and disappears. The main goal of treatment is to stop the skin cells from growing so quickly.
Psoriasis is not infectious, said Dr. Nayani Madarasingha in her opening remarks. 30% of people get Psoriasis through their genes. Those with a family history of Psoriasis have a higher chance of having symptoms. Once the cells from the basal layer moves up they change their shapes during the way and once the nuclei die they become lifeless and shreds off. The entire process spans for about 28 days and it is invisible. But in some people this process happens in an abnormal way and it happens fast. So the dead skin layer accumulate on the skin. It could occur in childhood or later in life, Dr. Madarasingha said.
Some of the common areas where this condition could occur include elbows, knees and even the scalp, she continued. Psoriasis that occurs in the scalp could have thicker scales when compared to dandruff. Sometimes it could even affect the entire body including the palms and soles,she
went on.

Symptoms
Some of the common signs and symptoms include : 
Red patches of skin covered with thick, silvery scales,
	Small scaling spots
	Dry, cracked skin that bleed
	Thickened, pitted or rigged nails 
	Swollen and stiff joints 

Variants of Psoriasis
According to Dr. Madarasingha there could be variants of Psoriasis and Pustular Psoriasis is one of them. Here tiny pustules could appear in the form of yellow blisters. Symptoms could include fever, dry skin and it could affect the nails thereby causing discolouration or it may come to a point where nails will fall off from the nail bed, -the doctor emphasised.

Other types of Psoriasis include : Plaque psoriasis :The most common form, plaque psoriasis causes dry, raised, red skin lesions (plaques) covered with silvery scales. Nail psoriasis : Psoriasis can affect fingernails and toenails, causing pitting, abnormal nail growth and discoloration. Guttate psoriasis :This type primarily affects young adults and children. Its usually triggered by a bacterial infection such as strep throatInverse psoriasis : This mainly affects the skin in the armpits, in the groin, under the breasts and around the genitals. Inverse psoriasis causes smooth patches of red, inflamed skin that worsen with friction and sweating. Erythrodermic psoriasis : The least common type of psoriasis, erythrodermic psoriasis can cover your entire body with a red, peeling rash that can itch or burn intensely.Psoriatic arthritis : In addition to inflamed, scaly skin, psoriatic arthritis causes swollen, painful joints that are typical of arthritis. Sometimes the joint symptoms are the first or only manifestation of psoriasis or at times only nail changes are seen. Symptoms range from mild to severe, and psoriatic arthritis can affect any joint. 
Dr. Madarasingha further said that people having Psoriasis have higher risks of developing obesity and cardiovascular diseases as well. In Sri Lanka we do find people with mild conditions, but the prevalence rate hasnt been calculated, she further said. 

Risk factors
Anyone can develop psoriasis, but these factors can increase your risk of developing the disease:Family history : This is one of the most significant risk factors. Having one parent with psoriasis increases your risk of getting the disease, and having two parents with psoriasis increases your risk even more.Viral and bacterial infections : People with HIV are more likely to develop psoriasis than people with healthy immune systems are. Children and young adults with recurring infections, particularly strep throat, also may be at increased risk.Stress : Stress can impact your immune system and high stress levels may increase your risk of psoriasis.Obesity : Excess weight increases the risk of psoriasis. Lesions (plaques) associated with all types of psoriasis often develop in skin creases and folds.Smoking : Smoking tobacco not only increases your risk of psoriasis but also may increase the severity of the disease. Smoking may also play a role in the initial development of the disease.

Treatment
According to the dermatologist, treatments depend on the severity of the condition. There is no cure for Psoriasis but it could be treated. If the condition is severe where it has affected a greater surface area of the body we recommend oral drugs. In severe instances we also recommend phototherapy where we use UV light to treat the condition. Even injections could be given. Sometimes it appears during a certain period and then goes off. In such instances people can stop medication once its fully recovered, the doctor said.

Wrapping a puzzle in a conundrum!
	

The Green party activists in an upcountry district met for a discussion in the salubrious city quite recently.

The party high-up representing the district chaired this meeting. Who is going to be the party candidate at the coming big poll was the question many participants raised at this meeting.
The activists expected an answer to this question from their leader himself notwithstanding a recent official party announcement that a choice is yet to be made.
The district chief hinted three names -his own and those of two others known to have been long time aspirants. He added:
But, there is also the possibility of the candidate being someone occupying a much higher position!

A great personality imbued with merit and wisdom
	
Remembering Sir Cyril de Zoysa on his 122nd birth anniversary

I am now a free man. Ones affluence is not a matter of importance. Everything is delusive. I was born without wealth. I shall pass away without wealth. My peace, my joy, my strength lies in my philosophy  in the Dhamma to which I subscribe. This is a statement Sir Cyril de Zoysa made in his twilight years. Contained within this is the truth and reality of life that every religion preaches. 
Sir Cyril de Zoysa is no more. Although he is not physically present with us, his lifestyle was such that he left behind a generous bequest of examples for us to emulate. I have not seen Sir Cyril de Zoysa in the flesh and blood, but I have seen the services he has rendered to all and sundry. Through such services, I see him. I see him also through the lives of his family members whom I know very closely. It was a close relationship that my father had with them. It is precisely because of this bond that my sisters, who were schooling at Kalutara Balika Vidyalaya and Holy Family Convent, Kalutara, stayed with Sir Cyrils sister in her home, at the outset, when they were admitted to schools in Colombo. As I write, thoughts come to mind of what my sisters said Sir Cyrils sister and how she treated them with love and care in her home at Frazer Avenue, Dehiwala.

"Sir Cyril de Zoysa is no more. Although he is not physically present with us, his lifestyle was such that he left behind a generous bequest of examples for us to emulate"
While he held the post of Chairman of the Urban Council (UC) in the 1940s, this particular sisters son, Kingsley Wickremasinghe, was later elected several times by popular vote to the chairmanship. I recall how much he wished to engage in the development of the Kalutara town and to solve the problems faced by people who were suffering from housing problems, and how much effort he spent on this matter. This was the time when I was State Minister of Housing. I believe that his desire to ease the pain of the ordinary man, his forthrightness and the discipline he evinced are qualities he imbibed from the Cyril de Zoysa ancestry. 
In the 1960s during the days of my youth, I have seen Sir Cyrils brother, Advocate V. T. de Zoysa, together with Queens Counsel A.C. Goonaratne visiting us - being in and out of our home. At this time the two of them were in charge of the management of the affairs of the UNP in the Kalutara District. In turn my father too was in and out of their homes and their office. On many such occasions I have joined my father. Carrying forward this bond to the next generation, it is a great joy that today, Ajita and Tilak de Zoysa, continue to maintain a strong bond with us. Today, these two nephews, Ajita de Zoysa, Chairman of the Kalutara Bodhi Trust and Tilak de Zoysa, the Secretary, are engaged in carrying forward effectively Sir Cyrils vision suitably adapted to meet the needs of the era. It was during a time when for centuries, the native community was deprived of many of its fundamental rights as well as a sense of self respect, that Cyril de Zoysa was born,these were times when patriotic Sri Lankan leaders were resolutely striving to save the native community from this impasse and bring them forth to the forefront. Young Cyril too followed this path, took on these responsibilities as though they were his own, and made his contribution at prime level. The Kalutara Bodhi, Kalutara Vidyalaya and Balika Vidyalaya rank among the highest symbols of his contribution. 

"Today we live in an era which is in desperate need of sons in the image of Sir Cyril"
It is observed that patriotic heroes are born in different countries in different eras as though it were to help fulfil the needs of each such era. Sir Cyril de Zoysa may be deemed to be one such man of the era, born at the end of the nineteenth century in order to meet the needs of the 20th century. Born on October 26, 1896 in the Galle District and educated at St. Thomas College, Matara, Richmond College, Galle and Royal College, Colombo, he was admitted to the Ceylon Law College and then commenced his professional career in 1921 as a lawyer in the Balapitiya Bar. Later, he moved to Kalutara where he achieved fame as a clever lawyer. There in the city of Kalutara did the golden age of his life dawn. A true son of the soil, he dedicated his life to the service of the people in the capacity of Urban Council Chairman, a member and later President of the Senate. 
When he was a law student, he conducted private tuition classes. With his savings he bought a bullock cart and presented it to his father who was hitherto dependent on a hired cart to travel to his office to practice his profession as a notary. Thus, did he evince the great quality of fending for ones parents. 
Never did he lose his head when he received in his lifetime many official appellations, honours, positions and a knighthood. He simply used them in the service of the Sasana, his country and the community. However many services he rendered, buildings he constructed or donations he made, never did he seek publicity by having his name carved in stone or displayed on name boards. 

"He had made significant contributions towards Buddhistmissionary activities"
Deeply touched by the depths to which the Sacred Bodhi Tree at Kalutara had fallen owing to neglect caused by the fact that the country had fallen into foreign hands, he gave leadership to the mission to develop the sacred place, broke through all obstacles in his way and constructed at his own cost a stand upon which devotees may place flowers, thereby making this an open place of worship. He had the Kachcheri (the Government Agents Office), the Residency (official residence of the GA) and the premises acquired, and a Chaithya built atop the hillock, so that the sacred precincts flanked that part of the main Colombo-Galle Road, by way of an upper and lower compound with a Chaithya each on either side. 
On another occasion when he was again deeply touched by the state of neglect into which sacred Buddhist premises had fallen, he removed forthwith the gold ring he wore in a finger in his right hand and made arrangements to cash it in order to renovate the place. He has made significant contributions towards Buddhist missionary activities in various countries and also played a significant role in restoration of the London Buddhist Vihara. Very significantly, he had a section of the Buddhist Vihara redesigned to form living space for Sri Lankan (then Ceylonese) students in London.
When the restoration of the Kiri Vehera at Kataragama had come to a standstill, Sir Cyril took matters in hand and within a brief period of time completed the work, had the pinnacle placed atop the Dagoba, in traditional style, by the Prime Minister of the day, Dudley Senanayake. He had the road from Kataragama Devalaya to Kiri Vehera cleared and out of it made a beautiful path which connected the two religious centres, one to the other. 

"He set a fine example oftreating all religions with respect"
While Sir Cyril took the initiative in setting up the Moragalla Aaranya Senasanaya (hermitage), he was an unostentatious Buddhist who contributed much towards the development and progress of many Buddhist temples. Some such were the Kande Viharaya at Aluthgama, Gangarama Viharaya at Hunupitiya in Colombo, Jayasekararamaya at Kuppiyawatta in Colombo, Bellanwila Viharaya, Vajirarama Viharaya at Bambalapitiya and Saddharmalankara Pirivena at Pinwatta. The construction and donation of a hall in memory of his parents for the Young Mens Buddhist Association (YMBA) when he was serving as its President, the construction of the YMBA building in Colombo Fort and the construction of Pilgrims Rests in Kataragama, Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa are among the many altruistic services he rendered. 

"Never did he lose his head when he received in his lifetime many official appellations, honours, positions and a knighthood"
He established the Swarnapali Bus Company which developed into the South Western Bus Company. He commenced a Kataragama-Colombo bus service so that a link between the Southern and Western Provinces was formed. Through this he generated employment and gained much popularity. Soon, transport services were nationalised and the company taken over by the government.  Unbowed, Sir Cyril built a factory for the Associated Group of Companies on a vast tract of land at Palatota in Kalutara, to commence the production of hitherto imported tyres and tubes and to build a tyre retreading facility; also factories to produce batteries and for the local production of refrigerators of the Sisil brand.
With such foresight he created the circumstances under which the steady flow of exchange to other countries was arrested thereby ensuring vast savings for the country. This way he also generated employment opportunities for thousands of people. He did not forget his native village of Balapitiya where he commenced a power loom textile weaving factory thereby generating employment for many fellow villagers. 
It has never been known that he tried to have the Christian Church which is located next to the Bodhiya premises removed or to cause any inconvenience to the church, at any time. As a good Buddhist, living a life in accordance with the Buddhist philosophy, this may be cited as a fine example of treating all religions with respect. May I conclude this piece of writing with a quotation from Subhashita Kavyaya authored by erudite poet Alagiyawanna Mukaweti.
<U+0DB4><U+0DD2><U+0DB1><U+0DCA> <U+0DB8><U+0DB3> <U+0DB4><U+0DD4><U+0DAD><U+0DD4><U+0DB1><U+0DCA> <U+0DC3><U+0DD2><U+0DBA><U+0DBA><U+0D9A><U+0DCA> <U+0DBD><U+0DAF><U+0DD4><U+0DC0><U+0DAD><U+0DCA> <U+0DB1><U+0DD2><U+0DC3><U+0DBB><U+0DD6>

Fruitless it is to have sired a hundred sons of scant merit One lone son of character, wisdom and power would suffice to command the highest respect. 
Sir Cyril de Zoysa was a son of the soil of Sri Lanka, imbued with merit and wisdom; he earned the love and respect of all; he brought credit to Mother Lanka; he was indeed a rare human being. Today we live in an era which is in desperate need of sons in the image of Sir Cyril.

A factory belonging to a thick chum of a onetime powerful politico was sealed some time ago by the authorities for defaulting on tax payments amounting to some Rs.150 million.

The factory high-ups are said to be now going after the Provincial Chief to get the factory re-opened without paying the due taxes.
However, the Provincial Chief had put his foot down that the factory would remain sealed until the full tax payment was settled.
Reacting to the Provincial Chiefs firm response, the politico now mud on his face had reportedly told his buddy, If I were in the saddle, an occasion for you to go after various people with offerings would never have arisen!

By being able to give new life to PET plastic packaging, we are a proud partner in Coca-Colas vision of a World without waste and look forward to scaling the collection bin network across our other outlets too soon.

Dissolve Cabinet, form caretaker govt.: Rathana Thera
	
President Maithripala Sirisena should immediately dissolve the Cabinet and establish a caretaker government with the support of all political parties, Parliamentarian Ven. Athuraliye Rathana Thera yesterday said.
He said the country was going through a rough patch and there were agitations taking place, mainly in response to the alleged plot to assassinate President Maithripala Sirisena and former Defence Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa.
No one is taking this issue seriously. But I think everyone should. Even though I have my reservations about the President, at a moment like this we should all come together to protect him. If a foreign country or government is trying to assassinate him, it is the responsibility of the authorities to conduct a proper probe, he told a news conference.
Commenting on the reports of Cabinet Ministers having affiliations with RAW and the roles played by former TID DIG Nalaka Silva and the IGP in the alleged assassination plot, the thera said these issues raise many questions.
Why is India trying to kill the President Once he is no more, who will become the President. According to the Constitution, the Premier will become the President. Does India want to make the Prime Minister the President or want to kill him as well These are serious issues. It doesnt matter if its India or China. If any faction wants to harm our sovereignty, everyone should join together to prevent it from happening, the thera said.
The thera said Sri Lanka is on the verge of becoming an unstable country with assassination plots and alienation of national assets in order to satisfy world powerhouses.
Just because we leased out Hambantota Port to China, it doesnt mean we should give India another asset. We should try to get back the Hambantota Port. I think all ministers and officials of this government should resign and go for an interim caretaker government until the next election is held. The President has the power to call for one according to the Constitution, he said.
The thera said he would meet all political leaders including the President, the Premier, former President Mahinda Rajapaksa and the JVP to discuss the formation of an interim government in the next few days. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

He said he could not understand why 23 SLFP members were still in the government even after the media exposed an alleged plot to assassinate President Maithripala Sirisena and former defense secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa.
He said it was time for all the SLFPers to quit the government and unite all anti-UNP forces to form a government with Mahinda Rajapaksa as the prime minister.
We are canvassing for a caretaker government and not for an interim government to replace the yahapalana government. I cant think of a better opportunity to topple this government and form our own government. All progressive forces who are against the policies of this government must unite under Mr. Rajapaksa and form a government soon, the MP said.
Commenting on the remarks made by the President at the F.R.Senanayaka memorial ceremony, he said all what he said was correct.
DS and Dudley set up farmer colonies and resettled landless people there. We reap the benefits of these policies today. Unfortunately what Ranil is doing now is selling lands and national assets to foreigners. That is the difference between UNP under Senanayakas and Wickremesinghes, the MP said.
He said bankrupt politicians like Sarath Fonseka had undertaken the hatchet job on behalf of Ranil and was attacking the President.
MP Thilanga Sumathipala said requesting Indias assistance to probe Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) was an insult to SLC.
Arjuna wants to pay back the gratitude for India agreeing to purchase the Trincomalee oil tanks. Therefore, he requests Indias help to clean Sri Lankan cricket. This is an insult, he said (Sandun A Jayasekera)

Govt. must intervene to increase daily wage: Digambaram
	
The government should intervene in addressing the estate workers' demand for a daily wage of Rs.1000, if not he will have to reconsider his decision to be in the government, Hill Country New Villages, Infrastructure and Community Development Minister Palani Digambaram said.
Recently, estate workers carried out several protest campaigns demanding that their basic daily wage of Rs.500 be increased to Rs.1000.
The minister told a news conference that the Government had the capacity to intervene and resolve this issue.
I heard the owners of estates saying that they could not increase the daily wage because their factories were making losses. It is not true. They earn enough profits but they pretend that their factories are running at a loss, the minister said.
I urge the estate owners to hand over their businesses to the Government, if they cant run them properly."
He said he had informed Plantation Minister Navin Dissanayake about what was happening and that this matter would be discussed on Monday. (Sheain Fernandopulle)

Govt. to invite India to develop WCT
	
The government has decided to invite India to develop the West Container Terminal (WCT) in the Colombo Port as a joint venture with the Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA), Ports and Shipping Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe said.
He said the government-to-government proposal would be submitted to the Cabinet next Tuesday
Sounding a conciliatory note, he said Sri Lanka had never given an undertaking to India to develop the East Container Terminal (ECT) and admitted that there was a delay in implementing the projects contained in the MOU signed between the two countries on April 26, 2017.
The minister said Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi had pointed this out when he met visiting Sri Lankan Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.
He told the SLFP news briefing that President Maithripala Sirisena had explained Sri Lankas stance on the ECT to Premier Modi when the two leaders met in Katmandu on the sidelines of the BIMSTEC summit in August.
"Sri Lankas position is that the ECT will be developed by the SLPA as a fully government-owned venture without any foreign collaboration or investment," the minister said.
Quoting the MoU signed by Indian Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj and Development Strategies and International Trade Malik Samarawickrama, he said Sri Lanka had not agreed any to Indian involvement in ECT development plan.
The MoU in the 9th paragraph says, A container terminal in Colombo Fort as a joint venture which includes Indian investment considering that majority of transshipment in Colombo Port is related to India. The GOSL will announce the award of the contract in this regard by end of May, 2017.
This is the only reference in the MOU in respect of the Port of Colombo and it says nothing about the ECT but only about A Container Terminal," the minister said. "The WCT development project requires a huge investment and with the completion of the development protects at both terminals, Sri Lanka will have three big container terminals that also includes South Asia Gateway Terminal. All three terminals will provide berthing facilities to some of the biggest ships, container carriers and tankers."
Referring to the two statements issued in New Delhi and Colombo at the end of the Sri Lankan Prime Minister's official visit to India, he said Sri Lanka admitted to a delay in implementing other projects mentioned in the MOU and that Sri Lankan government would make every effort to expedite them.

How a bold idea built a billion dollar business
	
Kris Canekeratne to deliver Ray Wijewardena Memorial Lecture on October 29

Technology has started to lead the way and at times one may be confused as to whether it is the technology that uses people or vice versa. Identifying the growing inefficiency of legacy IT systems and the emergence of .com prompted an individual to do something different. This was when Kris Canekeratne initiated Virtusa and was instrumental in changing the IT paradigm by focusing on engineering arbitrage over basic cost-takeout measures. As the co-founder, Chairman and CEO of Virtusa Corporation headquartered in the US, his efforts have led to a billion dollar venture with a vision to become the best digital engineering services firm in the world. The annual Ray Wijewardene Memorial Lecture (RWML) organised by the Ray Wijewardene Charitable Trust brings an innovative mind to its spotlight. This years (RWML) will be delivered by Canekeratne himself, who will relate the Virtusa Story in terms of Creating a culture of Innovation. In an interview with the Daily Mirror, Canekeratne shared his views on why he initiated this platform, why businesses should integrate technology and securing digital ventures. 
Excerpts : 
What prompted you to initiate a platform such as Virtusa
We started Virtusa based on a belief that the software industry was ready for transformation. That the growing inefficiency of legacy IT systems and the emergence of Digital (.COM back when we started) was going to require global corporations to re-think and re-build their entire IT infrastructure. The big idea back then was to help big companies deal with their IT legacy systems by not just cutting costs, but by actually adding value. While competitors were fixated on cost arbitrage (delivering the same services from lower cost geographies), we focused Virtusa on software engineering arbitrage  providing clients the transformative and sustainable benefits of software engineering best practices such as application rationalisation, consolidation, modernisation and automation, to reduce costs and increase innovation velocity. That focus and capacity has resulted in us becoming one of the fastest growing digital engineering companies in the world. 
Why should businesses integrate technology in the long-run and to what extent has Sri Lanka succeeded in this approach
The only way to survive let alone thrive in todays hyper-competitive world is to harness the full power of technology. Businesses are no longer about just business, but about the movement of and access to the right information at the right time, both inside the company and between the company and their customers. The right IT infrastructure and the right consumer facing interfaces enable smarter decisions, better customer experiences, faster go to market, improved margins and as importantly competitive advantage. Sri Lanka has a terrific opportunity to adopt cutting-edge technology to provide citizens, visitors, customers and consumers a true Digital experience. In many ways, the fact that the Government of Sri Lanka and businesses in Sri Lanka didnt adopt Digital 1.0 presents a great opportunity to leapfrog by adopting Digital 2.0. Much of this lies ahead for Sri Lanka. 
How challenging was it to train individuals to think in an innovative manner Or was it a challenge at all
You cant decree innovation. You cant make people be innovative. And Im not sure you can train them. What you can do is allow them, enable them, and celebrate them when they are innovative. Fundamentally innovation organisations are the consequence of innovative cultures which are the result of innovative leadership. This really means that it starts at the top with leadership. Since our inception the management team of Virtusa has been focused on fostering innovation at every level of the organisation, encouraging all employees not just to do but to solve. Solutioning is a way of operating within Virtusa, serving as a force multiplier for sustained innovation and a highly effective talent attractor. Weve also gamified Virtusas Continuous Integration Continuous Deployment platform, resulting in best-in-class engineers and engineering teams across the company constantly setting and resetting the bar of excellence, and effectively contributing to an ever-innovating meritocracy by leveraging the power of engineer sourcing to innovate and drive high-performance. 

"More and more global companies realise that the next phase of productivity and competitive advantage lies in the integration and synthesis of historically discrete systems, data and the supporting technologies and building the connective tissue to support an engaging Digital experience"
What lessons could Sri Lanka learn from the West in terms of the fast moving ICT sector
The central tenet of IT in the 21stcentury is Integration and Digitization. More and more global companies realise that the next phase of productivity and competitive advantage lies in the integration and synthesis of historically discrete systems, data and the supporting technologies and building the connective tissue to support an engaging Digital experience. The technology platform companies are quickly demonstrating the power of building businesses that are exclusively Digital. You cannot go to an Amazon customer centre, sales office or call an Amazon call center to buy or return anything from/to Amazon; the only way you can transact is through an omni-channel Digital experience. Most industries in the US are rapidly embracing what technology platform companies are doing by building Digital first and, in some cases, Digital only businesses. There are great examples and lessons that both the Sri Lankan Government and Sri Lankan industries can learn from and emulate. 
Going digital also impose cyber threats. We see how Facebook has already gone out of control. How could businesses/clients secure their ventures on digital platforms
Cyber-terrorism is not going to abate, but that is no reason to not forge towards fully digital enabled businesses. There are 1.5 billion websites in the world. Around 200 million are active. 99.999% run little to no risk of being hacked, in part due to advances in cyber-security and in part due to the simple fact that they are not a target of interest. As you might imagine, in our work with the largest financial services and technology companies in the world, we cannot afford risk exposure of any kind. Thats why we deploy the latest encryption tools to guard what we do. Beyond this, we work with our clients to make sure that the systems that we build are outfitted with the latest cyber security technology. This is a rapidly evolving area and what is critically important is to invest in Cyber security to protect your Digital assets and business. 
In what ways has Virtusa paved the way for the local ICT industry to merge into global digital ecosystems
Over 90% of our clients and our revenue is from North America, EU, UK, Australia, Singapore and Malaysia. All of the technology that we build out of our centre in Colombo is for leading companies and industries in these countries. This requires us to identify and hire highly qualified software engineers who have an opportunity to join Virtusa and work on cutting-edge technology that is shaping the future of Digital 2.0. Additionally, our platforms are inherently global, our standards are Global and our team members are groomed to be global citizens that have a passion for innovation. In order to accomplish this, we collaborate with many of the terrific Universities in Sri Lanka and are very pleased with the quality of education and enthusiasm about the young engineering talent. 

"You cant decree innovation. You cant make people be innovative. And Im not sure you can train them. What you can do is allow them, enable them, and celebrate them when they are innovative"
What lies ahead for Virtusa And how could those interested in IT be a part of it
Virtusa and the industries we serve are at a seminal moment. The digitization of businesses and the world will only accelerate. The task to innovate will only grow in consequence. Virtusa is incredibly well positioned to help our clients envision and usher in transformative digital futures, creating competitive differentiation for them and for us. Over the past eight years, Virtusa has grown at the top echelon of the IT services industry, growing on average 25% year. We are well on our way to realizing our vision of becoming the leading Digital Engineering company in the world, by leveraging the platform and philosophies that helped us turn a bold start-up just outside Boston, Massachusetts into a billion+ dollar global leader. Our goals are to continue to grow above industry growth rates, expand our leadership position in Digital engineering, provide unparalleled career opportunities, and to be recognized as the best digital engineering company in the world to work at. 
Our Sri Lankan operation is a major part of our global organization. We continue to seek team members for a variety of positions. We welcome well qualified applicants for a variety of different roles and positions. These positions are publicised through a variety of Digital forums.

Human deaths  by elephants due to irresponsibility
	
Elephants dont kill humans; but humans who get themselves killed by elephants  Dr. Sumith Pilapitiya

In most instances its not the elephants that kill humans its the humans that get themselves killed by the elephants due to their stupidity and negligence said Dr. Sumith Pilapitiya former Director General of the Department of Wildlife delivering the monthly lecture of the Wildlife and Nature Protection Society (WNPS) Focus on Human-Elephant Conflict Management at the BMICH last Thursday (18).70% of the human deaths by elephants are due to human irresponsibility he added. 
He also said that the human deaths caused by elephants were a mere fraction when compared to the number of deaths due to motor accidents. Humans should take more responsibility for their lives. In most instances it is people who have been under the influence of alcohol that have got themselves killed by challenging the elephants rather than avoiding them. Dr. Pilapitiya said that there were instances when people had been so negligent that they have crashed into elephants and got themselves killed. If we are more responsible and do not act stupidly we can reduce the number of human deaths significantly he said. 

"The HEC conflict started increasing with the large scale irrigation and agricultural development drive which commenced in the 1950s"
In his opening remarks Dr. Pilapitiya said that in 1950s Singapore PM Lee Kuan Yew had been known to have told that he hoped someday Singapore would be like Ceylon but from the mid 1970s onwards every successive government in our country had hoped that Sri Lanka would march ahead of Singapore. But we are far from it today. One of the main reasons is that we continue to keep making mistakes and keep on repeating them without learning from them. When it comes to the management of the Human Elephant Conflict (HEC) once again I think we are in a similar situation he added. 
Referring to research material and statistics obtained from Dr. Pruthuviraj Fernando and the Centre of Conservation and Research (CCR), Dr. Pilapitiya said that in Sri Lanka there are known to be about 6000 elephants in the wild. Sri Lanka has the highest density of Asian elephants as well as a very high population density of humans inasmuch as it has a declining natural resource base. Unless we plan our development better conflict is inevitable he warned.HEC cannot be eliminated fully. As long as there are humans and as long as there are elephants there is going to be conflict. The only thing we could do is manage and minimize the conflict 
The HEC conflict started increasing with the large scale irrigation and agricultural development drive which commenced in the 1950s. In the year 2000, 150 elephants died in contrast to only 63 humans deaths caused by elephants. But in 2017, 256 elephants died while 87 humans had lost their lives to elephant attacks. 

	Wild Life Department was under severe pressure to carry out orders

	In 2017, 256 elephants died while 87 humans had lost their lives to elephant attacks
	
The committee for the preservation of wildlife appointed in 1959 came up with a plan to manage the HEC in the island by driving all the elephants from developing areas to Department of Wildlife and Conservation (DWC) protected areas through identified corridors and fencing them in. 
There were three approaches to manage the HEC namely 
1. Translocation of problem elephants to Department of Wildlife protected areas 
2. Large scale elephant drives from areas identified for development to DWC protected areas 
3. Confining elephants to DWC protected areas with the use of physical, biological and psychological barriers. 
If this strategy was successful the HEC would have been minimal today. A survey conducted by the CCR shows that 44% of the land area of the island is being shared by humans and elephants. He said that research had shown that capture and translocation was not successful nor could biological fences confine elephants within protected areas. 
Dr. Pilapitiya said that most national parks were at their maximum carrying capacity and by driving more elephants into such DWC protected areas would result in the death of many elephants and calves due to starvation. He mentioned of one elephant drive that costs the government Rs. 62 million to drive 225 elephants and calves into a wildlife protected area. He said that the end result was that the problem was not solved as it was only the she- elephants and calves that were driven while the single males and male groups had remained to forage on crops and many of these elephants that were driven died due to starvation.No one was held accountable for the fiasco and the waste of public funds. It was the development sector that should be held accountable as the wild life department was under severe pressure to carry out orders 

	44% of the countrys land area is being shared by humans and elephants
	
	
	Road accidents claim more victims than HEC
	
The National Elephant Conservation Policy (NECP) which is in effect today was drawn up by a multi stake holder committee and approved by the cabinet in 2006. Some of the goals of the policy are to ensure the long term survival of the elephant in the wild of Sri Lanka, to mitigate the HEC and to promote scientific research as the basis of conservation and management in the wild. Some key points are that managing as many viable populations of elephants possible that the land will support and the land holders will accept both within and outside the system of protected areas. The policy also specifically states that when elephants lose their range they die. 
Dr. Pilapitiya said that a new plan for resolving HEC was approved by the cabinet of ministers on August 7, 2018 which is more in line with the 1959 plan and contradicts certain aspects of the 2006 policy. To the best of my knowledge Policies should be driving plans and plans should not be driving policies he stressed. 
He also said that there are many positives in the recent cabinet paper such as constructing 2651 km of electric fences within identified areas which shows that there was still room to construct the fences on ecological boundaries rather than the administrative boundaries. It is imperative that inasmuch the new fences are constructed on the ecological boundaries and all existing fences should be relocated to ecological boundaries Dr. Pilapitiya emphasized. Among his concerns was arming those who are to be entrusted with maintaining the fences with sophisticated weapons that are capable of killing an elephant in its tracks. Accidents do happen! he quipped. 

"The HEC conflict started increasing with the large scale irrigation and agricultural development drive which commenced in the 1950s"
Dr. Pilapitya said that development plans should be made accepting the elephants presence and by working around them rather than driving them away. A win-win situation could be achieved by relocating the development project rather than create conflict He also said that it was scientific findings and past experience that should govern the decision making. All options should be looked at. Community based village fences and seasonal agricultural fences would be a viable alternative if it is not possible to construct fences on the ecological boundaries he said. 
These were some things that I intended to do when I was the Director General of the Department of Wildlife and Conservation but I resigned as I was unable to perform my duties due to political pressure Dr. Pilapitiya admitted. As conservationist we can lobby and convince decision makers to take the correct decisions rather than repeat the mistakes we made in the past

Inclusivity and diversity of Sri Lankan creative expression prominent at AK Lit Fest 2018
	
If there was a place where creative expression in a variety of forms found inclusivity, it was indeed at the A&K Lit Fest held recently at the Mount Lavinia Hotel. Hosted for the 4th consecutive year, this years festival created a platform for local creative talent in the true Annasi & Kadalagotu style.
The warm up sessions were stages for the budding writers, with the launch of the book The School Detective Gang by young Abdul Azeez, and creative writing workshops running parallel for adults and children. However, the entire attention of those present was directed at the next session Literature in Governance  the Politics of Writing with eminent politicians present not in their usual roles, but as those who have contributed to literature in their own accord. The discussion led by Malinda Seneviratne had Prof. Rajiva Wijesinhe, Dr. Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe and Imthiaz Bakeer Markar speaking about creativity and the effects of regulatory on it.
The diversity of creative expression continued throughout the day withGihan De Chickera speaking about The inherent Sri Lankan ability to see humour in everything and Anoja Rajapathirana presenting a heartwarming session on Writing with Disabilities. Two panels, which have owned a permanent space in the AK Lit Fest programme The Story behind the Story and The Virgin Authors hosted Sunela Jayawardene speaking of The Line of Lanka in the former, and debut writers Megan Dhakshini, Sarah Kabir, Nathalie Fernando and Chiranthie Rajapakshe in the latter discussing their inspirations, motivations and getting a book out for the first time.
The latest addition to the line-up was the short film screening showcasing 4 films by talented young film makers, focusing on current social issues, which generated much positive feedback from the audience since opportunities to watch such local films are very limited. Continuing with visual creativity, the most awaited session with the makers of Koombiyo generated a lively and in-depth discussion about the tele-drama industry in Sri Lanka and the expression of realistic social issues.
The late afternoon was dedicated to three distinct panels; Women in Writing, Science Fiction and Poetry Corner: from Bard to Verse, the latter featuring modern Sinhala poets. Each gained a significant audience, reconfirming an objective of the AK Lit Fest from inception  celebrating the diversity of literature in Sri Lanka.
Following Cornerstone Speeches  a panel, which was as diverse as it could be, demonstrating tips on comedy, publishing, writing and diplomacy, the closing session was a tribute to the venue of the AK Lit Fest, the Mount Lavinia Hotel. Mohan Raj Madawala, whose novel Lovina brought to life the legacy of the hotel presented the historical background to his book. The curtains drew down to the festival with an amazing performance by up and coming Sri Lankan folk rock band Bambaroo, who also had a song specially titled Lovina.
The only but distinct drawback of the festival was the limited representation of Tamil literature, which would perhaps be resolved next year, at the 5thAnnasi&Kadalagotu Literary Festival. Despite this, the event stood up for what it promised to give all literary lovers, an affordable opportunity to be a part of what was Simply Literature, Simply Local.

India wrestles with significant outbreak of Zika virus
	

By Joanna Slater (c) 2018, The Washington Post Oct 25, 2018 - NEW DELHI - India is working to control an outbreak of the Zika virus that has infected more than 130 people in the city of Jaipur.
The Zika virus is spread primarily by mosquitoes. When pregnant women are infected, particularly in their first trimester, the virus has been linked to serious birth defects.
India is one of more than 80 countries where the Zika virus is present. 
Of the 135 people infected, 125 have recovered from their symptoms, they said. Approximately 40 pregnant women have been infected with the virus and they will receive special monitoring. Zika burst onto the global stage starting in 2015 when an unprecedented outbreak took place in South America, infecting hundreds of thousands of people.

## Title: Investigating cancer
## Section: Medicine
## Date: 26 October 2018 11:04 am
Investigating cancer
	

A cancer in a patient can be suspected from what he or she complains of (Symptoms) and what the doctor finds while examining the patient (Signs). To confirm this suspicion, he will order some investigations (Tests). Today we will be discussing about some of the commonly used investigations during these situations. 
The tests done can vary widely depending on the type of the cancer suspected, area of the body involved, other medical problems of the patient etc. However, investigations done when a cancer is suspected falls under to two main groups. 
1. Investigations done to confirm a diagnosis of cancer 
2. Investigations done to assess the extent of spread of the cancer. 

Radiological Investigations
These are mainly used to visualise an image of the suspected tumour which can be deep within the body. These radiological investigations play an important role in identifying the extent of the tumour spread. 
Ultra Sound Scan
This is the simplest and often the first such radiological test thats used. It is specially useful to differentiate a solid tumour from a fluid filled cavity like an abscess. It is also helpful as it uses only sound waves and the scan itself will not cause any harm and therefore you can repeat it often.

 
Computed tomography (CT) scan
This gives much sharper pictures of the tumour compared to an Ultrasound scan. It is specially helpful in clearly identifying the margins of the tumour. This is very useful when planning a surgery to completely remove the tumour. The CT scan is also the investigation of choice when viewing lung tissues. However a CT scan uses radiation to image the body. This radiation can be harmful. Therefore unless the benefit clearly outweighs the risks CT scans cannot be done on the same patient often. 

Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scan
Here magnetic fields are used to draw an image of the body. Since radiation is not emitted it can be used repeatedly. To identify brain tumours MRIs are best during investigation. This is also the gold standard to image many other parts of the body including muscles, fatty tissues and other soft tissues when cancer is suspected. 
Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scan
This is the new kind on the block in Sri Lanka. The advantage a PET scan has over others is that not only does it identify a tumour it also predicts whether its active. The best use of the PET scan is to see the response to treatment. Sometimes when you treat a cancer with chemotherapy and repeat either a CT or a MRI scan you can see the tumour still persisting. This might be due to, although all the cancer cells in the tumour have died it will take more time for the mass to disappear. A PET scan not only shows a tumour, but also reveals if the cells in the tumour are metabolically active (Alive). This is very valuable to decide if a cancer is responding to treatment.


Histology
This means taking some tissue from a tumour and checking through a microscope for cancer cells. This is the gold standard way of confirming the diagnosis of cancer and also identifying which type of cancer it is. There are several ways of obtaining tissue for histological examinations. Some of them are: 

Fine Needle Aspiration Cytology (FNAC)
A small needle is inserted and a few cells are taken out of the tumour. This is often done without anaesthesia and is the least invasive of all tissue obtaining procedures. It is used in initial diagnosis of thyroid cancer, breast cancer, identifying metastatic lymph nodes etc. 

Tru-cut biopsy
The same principle as the FNAC are applied. A bigger needle is applied and here a piece of tissue and not simply few cells is extracted. Since a piece of tissue is obtained medics can correctly identify the type of cancer as well. It is usually done under local anaesthesia. If a tumour is deep within the body, a US or CT guidance can be used to correctly identify where to take the biopsy from. It is done in breast cancer, bone cancer, soft tissue cancers etc. 

Excision biopsy
If a tumour is small enough (eg: a lymph node) the entire tumour can be removed and examined to look for cancer cells. The advantage of this is even if its a cancer and the entire tumour are removed further surgery is not needed. 

Incision biopsy
When the tumour is too big to be removed in one go, a small part of it can be removed surgically to identify exactly what sort of a tumour it is. Then it can be made smaller via other treatment modalities and removed completely later. 
After obtaining tissues a chemical process called immunohistochemistry (IHC) is very useful in differentiating between cancers. Today we know that different cancers express different receptors on their cell surface. We have various chemicals which can bind to these receptors and give that tissue a particular colour. Therefore after using IHCs depending on the colours taken up by the tissues an accurate diagnosis of the type of cancer can be made. 

Tumour markers
These are proteins which are circulating in blood which can be very high when a cancer has taken root. Eg: CA 125 in ovarian cancer, Thyroglobulin in differentiated thyroid cancer, CEA in Colon cancer etc. These tumour markers can be detected through simple blood tests and their levels are often proportionate to the amount of cancer cells in the body. Therefore these are an ideal marker not only to check how it is responding to treatment, but also after completing treatment, to use as a screening tool to check for recurrence of disease. 
Today cancer treatment has come a long way from relying only on a doctors best guess regarding the type and the extent of the disease. Today an oncologists has many weapons to boost their decision making process. However the choice of ideal investigations to best suit the individual patient still needs considerable experience and skill.

Investigation into pipe bombs intensifies Suspicious packages sent to Biden, De Niro
	

Authorities found suspicious packages addressed to former vice president Joe Biden and the actor Robert De Niro, officials said Thursday, setting off a new wave of alarm amid a sprawling investigation into pipe bombs mailed to prominent political figures and critics of President Donald Trump. 
The new packages, which resemble those sent to figures including former president Barack Obama and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, were located in Delaware and New York. Like the others, they were intercepted before reaching their intended targets. 
The devices found so far, which officials have described as pipe bombs, have put many in the country on edge, and authorities have begun an intensive effort to find other explosives that may still be out there. 
Investigators found a package addressed to Biden in a Delaware mail facility that was like the other pipe bombs found this week, according to a law enforcement official. The package was apparently not delivered to Bidens home the official said.

A similar package was also found addressed to De Niro, who has publicly clashed with Trump, at his production offices in Manhattan, according to law enforcement officials. A police spokesman said the parcel was similar to explosive packages that had been publicized.

Is Sri Lanka beautiful  at heart - EDITORIAL
	
Little Sri Lanka is sure to get a bit cocky now with travel guide book publisher Lonely Planet naming the island to be the top tourist destination in 2019. 
Well, is there anything wrong in being proud of this achievement given that Sri Lanka has had little to celebrate after the civil war and after the islands administrators were seen as a ruthless bunch by the world in how they quelled the tiger rebels 
According to Lonely Planet, Sri Lanka has topped the list of travel destinations because the island now boasts of new roads, rail lines, new internal flights, opportunities for ecotourism, wellness retreats and offers travel packages that suit the budget of tourists from all walks of life. 
Sri Lankas Prime Minister was the first to jump on the bandwagon of celebrations and said, Lets make this award a starting point for us to take tourism to a higher level. But what we Sri Lankans dont quite seem to fathom is that tourists, specially Europeans, want to see decency, courtesy and respect for others practised in this island. Tourists are quite aware of the harassment that females have to endure at Sri Lankan night clubs and beach parties. They are aware of the fact that Sri Lankans have a very low opinion and little respect for white-skinned women who frequent the islands tourist hot spots.
Premier Wickremesinghe has been bold enough in stating that the tourism industry should review its shortcomings. The authorities in this country must know that tourism offers a window to tourists to take a peep into our culture and see how we treat out fellow human beings. 
Right now the roads to the north are opened up and there are many constructions taking place on both sides of the road. But the islands administrators are continuing to pay the heavy price for finishing off the war against the tiger rebels. Right now Sri Lanka is under fire by the OHCHR. The council has doubts that the transitional justice agenda committed to by Sri Lanka under the councils resolution 30/1 could be fully implemented before the next report of OHCHR is released in March next year. When tourists visit other nations they wish to see that the host countries are not violators of Human Rights. When countries violate human rights it makes the outside world look at them with condemnation and suspicion. 
The Sri Lanka authorities have done much for the well-being of the minorities and this was stressed recently by the premier himself. But According to Wickremesinghe, despite some progress being made in ensuring the rights of the minorities, the international community
remains rigid. 
When the foreign tourists use public transport they are often bugged by beggars, a good number of them being minors! This poses the question, how many children are denied of the opportunity to attend school
We are known for our great smiles and hospitality when these visitors are at our doorsteps or check into our hotels. But all that friendliness can vanish when they motor on the road. Sri Lankans are known to bring out the devil in them when they are behind the wheel of a vehicle. 
These tourists are often amazed when they are eyewitnesses to the protests which demand a change of Government. Recently we saw the JVP taking to the road in protest and demanding that the people rally together to unseat this Government. Udaya Gammanpilla of the Joint Opposition was quick to question why the JVP was complaining now because it initially supported the forming of this Government. Politicians are not soothsayers and can only trust and hope that a new Government will deliver when they back a move to form a regime. If a regime fails, even their supporters have a right tolook elsewhere. 
The rating by Lonely Planet is an eye-opener for Sri Lanka to right its wrongs. Foreign tourists are not fooled by the outer appearance of a nation. Beauty is only skin deep!

Khashoggis killing was premeditated: Saudi Public Prosecutor
	

By Tamer El-Ghobashy (c) 2018, The Washington Post  Oct 25, 2018 - -ISTANBUL - Saudi Arabias public prosecutor said on Thursday that Jamal Khashoggi was killed in a planned operation, based on information it received from Turkish investigators in Istanbul, according to a statement from the kingdoms Foreign Ministry. 
The Foreign Ministry did not say what led the prosecutor to draw that conclusion, only that it was based on information shared by Turkish investigators working with Saudi officials in Turkey. 
According to the statement, a joint Saudi-Turkish investigative team in Istanbul indicates that the suspects in the incident had committed their act with a premeditated intention. 
Still, neither Trump nor Saudi Arabia have been willing to implicate Saudi leadership in the journalists killing. American intelligence officials and lawmakers have said that an operation targeting a critic of the royal court in a foreign country is unlikely to have been ordered without the knowledge of senior Saudi officials.

Last week Saudi Arabia said it had arrested 18 people and dismissed five officials.

Kumar Welgama: Righteous anger or sour grapes
	

Political splits are inevitable. They happen and are easy to predict. The reasons for those splits, however, are difficult to ascertain. More often than not, feel-good, self-righteous, chest-thumping statements about democracy and good governance are made to the public. The public, for their part, believes these to be the causes for those splits, when the reality may be different. After all, who can now deny that the ruckus over good governance was a cover for the personality clashes that led to the defections of so many parliamentarians Who cannot now trace Duminda Dissanayakes decision to defect from the Rajapaksas to the Rajapaksas acts of snubbing his father 
The bottom line is that when it comes to defections like this, there are always distinctions made in public between righteous anger (provoked by the excesses of a ruling coalition) and sour grapes (provoked by the ruling coalition snubbing them). Such distinctions go a long way in painting the defectors as decent, just, and untainted by scandal. When, of course, the truth may be completely different. 
The Joint Opposition is more than three years old. The Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) is now almost two years old. The latter was an offshoot of a party, established in 2000, that had failed to garner much support: the Sri Lanka Jathika Peramuna (SLJP). The definitive precursor to the Pohottuwa, the SLJP had made waves as a political party with its own platform and manifesto, even campaigning at the 2015 election alongside a plethora of small time, independent candidates. Wimal Geenage, the leader of the party, who was probably (though we can never be sure) installed as a Rajapaksa Proxy at the elections (for the record, he emerged last, with a grand collection of 1,826 votes or 0.02% of the total number), raised speculation as to who would take over. When G. L. Peiris took over with the Joint Opposition, the SLJPslogo, a cricket bat, was changed to the now instantly recognizable flower bud. Much like Sarath Fonseka filing nomination papers from an unknown party linked to the Democratic United Front (DUF), then, the SLPP was a product of an unknown party, of vague political affiliations. 

"The definitive precursor to the Pohottuwa, the SLJP had made waves as a political party with its own platform and manifesto, even campaigning at the 2015 election alongside a plethora of small time, independent candidates"
It was also a product of a shifting array of ideologies. Broadly, these are of two types. On the one hand, there are those who wish to see MR return. On the other hand, there are those who wish to see the Rajapaksas return. Yes, there is a clear difference. The one has hedged its bets on the man behind the movement, the other on the culture of nepotism he is said to have institutionalized during his term. No, its not easy to distinguish between the two. Where would MR be without his family, after all, and where would that culture of nepotism be without him When the SLPP was begun, the Rajapaksa Restoration Project centred on MR. Supporters wanted him to come back. Gotabhaya and Basil, while not on the sidelines, were not a primary concern. The reason was obvious: Basil had, in popular opinion, had a history of shifting political loyalties (he abandoned the SLFP during the eighties), and Gotabhaya held a dual citizenship. For them to win big, a massive campaign had to be launched to market their winnability, Gotabhaya on the basis of his term at the Urban Development Authority (UDA) and Basil on the basis of his skills in getting things done outside Colombo (an ability that once earned him the unlovely sobriquet Mr. 10 Percent from Chandrika Kumaratunga). Kumar Welgama is not the first politician to harbour reservations about the trajectory of the SLPP in this respect. If rumours are true, such reservations have been harboured by other party firebrands, even the likes of Wimal Weerawansa and Gamini Lokuge. But Welgama is the first to come out publicly with his disenchantment. 
The statements he has made at rallies organised by the SLPP are revealing. He has claimed that he would not be supporting a candidate other than a democratic leader, that this extends even to the Rajapaksa family, and that the candidate the party fields in 2020 will have to be at least a Pradeshiya Sabha member. That last insinuation makes it clear that he is not happy with Gotabhaya Rajapaksa becoming the candidate. The reasons he gives are, while not vague, nevertheless complicated: he is for freedom and democracy, he is against nepotism, and he opposes racism. The racism charge fits in neatly with the UNPs image of Gotabhaya as a Muslim bashing opportunist, an image borne more than anything else out of a photograph taken of the man and Gnanasara Thera together. The nepotism charge and harangue against the mans democratic credentials (or lack thereof) fit in neatly with the UNPs white van rhetoric against his family. In other words, Welgama is subscribing to the propaganda those opposed to the SLPP, a party he ostensibly represents, is churning out to protect what little vililajjawa (shame) they have. For what reason 
We can speculate that it has nothing to do with the Rajapaksas or the values he claims to be standing for, and that it instead has to do with a clash between him and the other stalwarts. Since of late, he has gone public with his grievances with them, suggesting that Mahindananda Aluthgamage is a coward and that Gamini Lokuge was a member of the group that organised the burning of the Jaffna Library. We can speculate that he is probably being sidelined by the establishment in the SLPP. The conclusion, then, is that it is a case of sour grapes. 
On the other hand, Welgama is no Duminda Dissanayake. He has a history. He has displayed commitment. At the end of the day, yes, commitment is a mere token in that cynical sphere called politics where anyone and indeed anything can be brought over for a song and a dance. But then again, it counts. 
While Welgamas political career is not as illustrious as Lokuges or Weerawansas, it is nevertheless long. Rajitha Senaratne, a politician one would not associate with the man, claimed once that there were essentially two kinds of peoples representatives and that Welgama belonged to the class who were ready to spend their private assets and money for the sake of politics. Given the accusations against him based on what he did and allegedly picked up during his tenure as Transport Minister, such praise seems unmerited. But as far as history goes, his record cannot be questioned in the way, for instance, that Lokuges (very validly) can. 

"If rumours are true, such reservations have been harboured by other party firebrands, even the likes of Wimal Weerawansa and Gamini Lokuge. But Welgama is the first to come out publicly with his disenchantment "
His career picked up after 1989 when he contested (unsuccessfully) at the General Election, but it began seven years before, when he was given the post of organiser for the SLFP in Agalawatte by Sirimavo Bandaranaike. At the time, the SLFP was in deep waters, Basil Rajapaksa was working at the Mahaweli Development Project (after siding with and abandoning the Maithripala Senanayake faction), and Gamini Lokuge was getting ready to contest from the UNP in Kesbewa (he would win a year later). From Deputy Ministerial portfolios in Transport and Power and Energy under CBK, he graduated as Minister for Industrial Development and Ranaviru Welfare and subsequently Transport under MR the latter portfolio being considered a particularly difficult and trying one. How did he take to it Consider that there was little to no coverage of the mans activities from 2005 to 2010 and that there was a spike in coverage after he was appointed as Transport Minister in 2010, and youll realise that the mans strengths were in that field. He had a past there. He made use of it. 
During his term, the SLTB implemented measures to increase its fleet from 4,500 to 7,000, no mean feat considering it had to compete against a mafia of 18,000 private buses. The SLTB, far from becoming a profitable venture, institutionalized a culture of cost optimization. While these measures were ostensibly pro-privatization (he had to ward off accusations), they went hand-in-hand with a firmly centrist approach to the management of the SLTB fleet and property, including the Ekala workshop.
The truth is that the Welgama saga marks the first time the SLPP, which months ago seemed invincible, has ruptured from within. The state media has caught up, and it is having a field day. As a final point, then, we can ask: righteous anger, or sour grapes Quoting Queen and Bohemian Rhapsody, we can answer: it doesnt really matter.

May God save Islam from anti-democracy rulers!
	
In the Middle East, democracy should be what an oasis is to a desert. But the irony is while Saudi Arabias crown prince, who is turning out to be the chief suspect in the killing journalist Jamal Khashoggi, holds the Davos in the Desert economy summit with the aim of making his country the regions next investment hub after Dubai, his country is digressing into a Jahiliyya kingdom.
In Islamic literature, the word Jahiliyya refers to the ignorant period that existed before Islam liberated the people and set them on a path to become the bright stars in the firmament of knowledge. During the Jahiliyya period, slavery and superstition were rampant; women were treated like chattel with no civic rights; and female infants were buried alive, for they were considered a humiliation. Debauchery was widespread. Violence and revenge killings were part of life and it is said inter-tribal violence continued for decades over trivial matters such as the straying of ones camel into a rivals territory.
Since slavery had been part of jahiliyya, if a state treats its people like slaves, denies them the freedom of speech, movement and assembly, the freedom to choose their rulers and oppresses womens political and civil rights, it only promotes Jahiliyya. Sadly, Saudi Arabia, the birth place of Islam, fits the description. Saudi Arabias claim that it is governed by Islamic Shariah, it appears, is only a charade. Islam condemns lies and deception. But since Khashoggi was mercilessly murdered in Saudi Arabias Istanbul consulate on October 2, the Saudis have changed their narrations umpteen times before they admitted that he was killed during interrogation that went wrong. Yet, they have not provided answers as to what they did to Khashoggis body.
On Wednesday, three weeks after Khashoggi was tortured, killed and dismembered, the Saudi media showed footage of Crown Prince Muhammad bin Salman, the man accused of ordering the killing, shaking hands with Khashoggis son, Salah, a dual Saudi-US citizen.
Behind this cold-hearted show of indifference is the bitter truth that Khashoggis family members in the kingdom are virtual prisoners. They are prevented from speaking out or leaving the country.
Yesterday, the crown prince told the Riyadh investment forum that those responsible will be held accountable... in the end justice will prevail.
Can a government said to be run by Shariah law resort to intimidation, acts of cruelty and taking a life without a fair trial If this is what Islam is, then God save Islam from Saudi rulers!
On January 9, 2013, Rizana Nafeek, a 24-year-old Sri Lankan woman, was beheaded in Saudi Arabia, for causing the death of an infant in her care while she was only a 17-year-old maid in a Saudi household. Plea after plea for mercy was rejected with the infants mother insisting that Rizana be put to death. She was beheaded. Eye for an eye and a life for a life: We were told this was Saudi law. On March 25, 1975, King Faisal was shot dead by his nephew. The prince was found guilty and beheaded publicly: We were told this was Saudi law which applied equally to all citizens. But it is unlikely whether anyone will be found guilty and beheaded in the Khashoggi killing, though evidence is strong that Khashoggi was killed by a killer squad sent by a very powerful person.
It is no surprise that most Arab and Islamic leaders have chosen not to speak up for justice. Most of them are themselves autocrats -- and, by throwing their weight behind the Saudi rulers in the Khashoggi affair, they seem to endorse oppression, lies and deception so that they can continue to receive the millions of dollars the kingdom throws at them regularly. Some of them were present at this weeks Riyadh investment summit.
If democracy is considered the worst form of government, except for all the others, then monarchical rule is the worst of the worst and an insult to the collective dignity of the worlds 7.6 billion people in an era where attempts to erode not only the freedom of human beings but also animals are squarely condemned. But yet, rather than being criticised and ostracized for human rights violations, Middle Eastern monarchs and autocrats are hailed as great leaders and given red-carpet reception in blatant acts of political hypocrisy. The Wests inaction or ineffective action indicated that for Western countries, Saudi contracts are more important than human rights and democracy promotion. Are we living in an era of sham liberation and enlightenment
The bitter reality is the West thrives in Middle Eastern autocracy. Will the leaders of the United States, or for that matter any of the Western nation preaching democracy to the rest of the world, adopt a principled policy that they will not meet or share platforms with undemocratic rulers, until the Khashoggi killing is thoroughly investigated and those responsible are punished
In 2003, the then US President George W. Bush claimed he sent troops to Iraq to end Saddam Husseins brutal dictatorship and bring democracy to that nation. The question that remains unanswered is: Why did not he send troops to Saudi Arabia, Egypt and other Arab countries ruled by dictators The US intervention in Iraq, Libya and Syria has more to do with oil and geopolitics than any democracy promotion.
What went wrong with the 2011 Arab Spring It is alleged that the US supported the counter revolution in Egypt to overthrow the democratically elected post-Arab-Spring government and bring back an autocrat in Abdel Fateh al-Sisi. Donald Trump will not even ask the Saudi royals to respect Saudi citizens expectations for democracy and freedom, though he describes the Saudi action as the worst cover-up in history and implicated the crown prince in the Khashoggi killing, saying Well, the prince is running things over there... so if anybody were going to be, it would be him.
Khashoggi fought for democracy. He believed Islam and democracy were compatible. His mission was to bring democracy to freedom-starved people of the Middle East, especially Saudi Arabia, where jails are filled with people who expressed their desire to have more freedom, and a say in the way the government is run. The Khashoggi affair wont be the Magna Carta moment or the no-tax-without-representation moment for the Saudis.
We wont be surprised if an earthshattering political event is staged  for instance, a surprise US military attack on some nation or like Wednesdays parcel bombs  to cause the disappearance of the Khashoggi killing from the political and media discourse.

Modhis removal of  CBI head illegal and criminal: Gandhi
	

Congress president Rahul Gandhi on Thursday stepped up his attack on Prime Minister Narendra Modi over removal of CBI chief Alok Verma, describing the centres post-midnight decision as a panic reaction to the agencys move to probe the Rafale fighter jet deal.
Gandhi said Vermas removal from the post was not just an insult to the Constitution of India but also illegal and criminal.
The question is why was he removed at 2 am... The main reason is that CBI was going to begin investigation in role of Prime Minister in Rafale and the corruption by Prime Minister in the Rafale deal, he said.
The Congress has questioned the legitimacy of Alok Vermas removal given that the CBI chief has a fixed two-year tenure and Vermas term runs till January-end.

All these trips are being made at public expense, they say.

Former President Mahinda Rajapaksas security can be stepped up if threats to his life had increased, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said.
Responding to concerns raised by JO MP Dinesh Gunawardane, the premier went on to say that Mr.Rajapaksa was already provided with special security for his residences in Wijerama, Medamulana and Carlton House.
As he is engaged in active politics he has been provided with STF personnel for back up as well, he said.
Raising the issue of the former presidents security, MP Gunawardane said that the head of VIP security had informed Mr.Rajapaksas team that security needed to be tightened as threats had increased.
Meanwhile, Minister of Law and Order Ranjith Maddumabandara promised to discuss the matter with the IGP and the head of Mr.Rajapaksas security team. (Ajith Siriwardane)
