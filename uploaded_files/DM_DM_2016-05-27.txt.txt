SL missing persons office lacks consultations: HRW
	
The Sri Lankan government ratified the Convention against Enforced Disappearance but in the same week created an Office of Missing Persons without promised consultations with families of the disappeared, the Human Rights Watch said today.
In a statement published on its website, the HRC said the government should honor its pledge to hold meaningful consultations with the affected families and nongovernmental representatives about the missing persons office and the other transitional justice mechanisms.
At the UNHRC in Geneva last year, the government agreed to hold nationwide public consultations on all transitional justice mechanisms. However, on May 24, Sri Lankas cabinet approved the new Office of Missing Persons without talking with the families who have long waited for justice. At the same time, it kept a key promise on May 25 by ratifying the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance, it said. 
Brad Adams, HRW Asia director said the Sri Lankan government is creating important structures to address the scourge of disappearances in the country But it should only do this after receiving input from the families most affected, he said.
The Office of Missing Persons is one of four transitional justice mechanisms Sri Lanka agreed to establish during the September 2015 Human Rights Council session in Geneva. In line with this promise, the government established a task force on public consultations in January 2016. The task force has been receiving public submissions with the final deadline for submissions extended until June 24, after which it will submit a full report.
The government will submit a report on its progress on transitional justice issues at the June session of the UN Human Rights Council.
The government deserves high marks for ratifying the Convention against Enforced Disappearance, but it needs to take urgent steps to build confidence with affected communities, Adams said. The government should ensure communication, transparency, and dialogue in all its transitional justice mechanisms.

SL refugee in Australia ordered to return despite safety fears
	
A Sri Lankan asylum seeker who has lived in Australia since arriving illegally by boat in 2012 has been ordered to return to Sri Lanka, despite telling authorities he feared he would be persecuted for his religion. 
According to the WA Today website, the Federal Court of Australia on Friday had dismissed the man's application to have a previous decision not to grant him a protection visa re-heard
The man claimed he fled Sri Lanka after his father was shot and killed by the Sri Lankan army and he and his family were captured and beaten by separatist group, Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, in 2008.
He arrived in Australia in August 2012 and applied for a protection visa in May 2013 on the basis of his Tamil ethnicity.
"While the tribunal accepted that Tamils in Sri Lanka continued to face a degree of harassment and discrimination on account of their ethnicity, such as difficulties accessing employment and disproportionate monitoring by security forces, it did not accept that this amounted to denial of their capacity to subsist, serious physical harassment or any other form of serious harm," Friday's Federal Court response to the man's appeal application read.
He claimed that although the civil war had officially been declared over in 2009, treatment against Tamils was still "severe".
If he does return to Sri Lanka, he will likely face a short term of imprisonment for unlawfully leaving the country.

Vehicle prices increased again
	
Prices of motor vehicles with a cylinder capacity between 1000 cc and 1500 cc and three-wheelers have risen as a result of the increase in the Unit Rate Tax from midnight yesterday, the Vehicle Importers Association of Sri Lanka (VIASL) said today.
However, the prices of some of the smaller vehicles with an engine capacity of less than 1500 CC such as Toyota Vitz, Passo, Honda Shuttle (Hybrid), Freed, Vezel, Insight, Suzuki Hustler and Wagon R (hybrid) decreased.
The VIASL President Indika Sampath Merenchige said the Unit Rate Tax has increased from Rs.2.6 million to Rs.3 million resulting in the price of a Toyota Prius increasing from Rs.3.3 million to Rs.7.7 million and would likely discourage people from importing Japanese vehicles in the future.
This is the highest tax increase on vehicles in recent history. The excise duty which was maintained at a lower level during the past three weeks has also been increased, Mr. Merenchige said.
The prices of electric vehicles will be increased according to its battery capacity while the Customs duty on electric vehicles with battery capacity of 100KW has been reduced. 
As such the Customs duty of Rs.2.9 million on a Nissan Leaf electric vehicle would be reduced to Rs.1.7 million.
Tax on vehicles such as lorries, buses and vans have not been increased.
If this practice continues, only vehicles below 1000cc engine capacity will be imported to the country in the future. The imports of motor vehicles with cylinder capacity between 1000cc and 1500cc would be reduced by 85 per cent, Mr. Merenchige said.
Meanwhile, Chairman of Lanka Vehicle Importers' Association Mahinda Sarathchandra said prices of vehicles with cylinder capacity exceeding 1599cc (1600cc) would be increased because of the newly introduced Transected Value or Unit Rate Tax according to the Extraordinary Gazette Notification issued yesterday.
He said the tax on a Nissan X-trail which is currently taxed at Rs.4 million would increase to Rs. 8 million, a two-fold increase in the price.
A Mazda Axela now costing Rs.3.8million would rise to Rs.8 million. Petrol Prado 150 was increased by Rs.5 million, a Land Cruiser 202 was increased by Rs.10 million.
This price increase is an unusual increase by the government and it is unfair to have such vehicle price increases again in a situation where vehicle prices increased repeatedly in a short time, Mr. Sarathchandra said. (Chaturanga Pradeep)
