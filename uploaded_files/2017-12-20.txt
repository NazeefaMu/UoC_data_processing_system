An echo of failed talks down the corridor
	
?
A rumour that went viral in the recent past said that the political scion from Giruwapattu and the JO stalwart from the Gampaha political and willow wielding family were responsible for scuttling the efforts to unify the two factions of the Blue party.?
?
The Wayamba sporty one who was among those eagerly looking forward to the success of peace talks began blaming in public the young man from Giruwapattu and his senior colleague from Gampaha for being villains of the peace.?
While this blame game was going high, the young scion and the sporty one met face to face on a council corridor the other day. The sporty one brought up the controversial issue straightaway. ?Why are you against the unification????
?How is that you forgot all about the need to keep the party intact at the time they were whacking us left and right?? the young scion shot back.?
Then the sporty one began a lecture on the virtues of the party unity, the young man however, waving away what the sporty one started telling said: ?Now stop all that palaver! If you have nothing else to talk about, let us depart!???
Their encounter ended on this discordant note!

Asbestos ban may have played a hand in tea export ban: Navin
	
Russia may not be happy about the ban of the use of asbestos in Sri Lanka and may have played a hand in tea export ban, Plantation Industries Minister Navin Dissanayaka said today.
Minister Dissanayaka addressing the weekly Cabinet news briefing said however the government has deferred the ban on the use of asbestos, manufacture and import of raw material until further notice. The ban was to be effective from 1st of January, 2018.
?We are awaiting a response from the Russian Government to discuss the current issues cropped up after Russia suspended export of ?Ceylon Tea? to Russia after an insect ? Khapra Beetle ? detected in a consignment of tea exported from Sri Lanka last week,? he added.
He said that President Maithripala Sirisena wrote to the Russain President soon after he learnt about the suspension of tea exports and a team led by him would pay a visit to Moscow immediately after the Russian government invited Sri Lanka for talks.
The tea export ban to Russia affects the foreign income and tea industry negatively; no doubt about it as tea exports to Russia is around 11% of all tea exports from Sri Lanka. But it will not affect the tea prices as Sri Lanka maintains a good price in the global market for Ceylon Tea right now. Sri Lanka would take more precautionary measures to ensure the quality of Ceylon Tea exported to other countries including Russia and EU. We consider the possibility of fumigation or issuing a quality assurance certificate for each and every tea container to ensure they did not contain any foreign matter, Minister Dissanayaka said.

Ban on Asbestos to be relaxed
	
The Cabinet yesterday decided to relax the ban imposed on the use of Asbestos roofing materials imported from Russia amid reports that the Russian Federation had allegedly retaliated by suspending tea imports from Sri Lanka.
Russia imposed a temporary restriction on tea imports from Sri Lanka last Thursday saying a beetle was detected in a consignment of tea purchased from Sri Lanka.
However, it is believed that this was in retaliation to Sri Lanka?s decision to ban the import of Asbestos roofing materials from Russia with effect from 2024 on the basis that such roofing materials were harmful to the environment.
Plantation Industries Minister Navin Dissanayake briefed the Cabinet on the crisis triggered by the restriction on tea exports to Russia and is reported to have informed the Cabinet that the ban on the use of Asbestos roofing materials was a likely factor that led to this crisis.
President Maithripala Sirisena had subsequently instructed the Cabinet to withhold the decision to ban the use of roofing materials for an indefinite period. (Kelum Bandara)

The Diyawanna member wanted to wrap up the deal to suit his own terms, but the purohita who gauged the desperate situation the member was placed in took a firm stand on the bargain and finally the member agreed to the terms that the purohita stipulated.?
The end-result is that the member has agreed to make a somersault to yahapalanaya, they say.
The JO big guns on hearing about this are said to be making counter moves to prevent the imminent event.
Meanwhile, there are indications that the deal is likely to fall through due to a different reason: the member is insisting on team member status at state level and there is no positive response to it from the highest echelons so far, they say.? ? ?

Envisioning the future of digital banking
	
As digitalisation grows at a very fast pace, technology is redefining the way we live, the way we work and the lifestyle we lead.
As technology evolves, banks need to actively work towards integrating new technologies to serve customers better. Today, innovation and technology have become game changers in revolutionising the landscape of the financial industry where banks are compelled to evolve to sustain their growth in the modern world.
Seylan Bank Chief Information Officer (CIO) Harsha Wanigatunga said: ?Seylan Bank is a fast evolving bank and thus we are always on top of the technology in this digital era in multiple ways to serve our valued customers better. Towards this end, our focus has always been to offer innovative banking solutions, where the user experience is great and highest level of security is ensured. Given this the bank continues to focus on the key pillars of customer convenience, security, innovative technology and process optimisation to offer an unparalleled digital banking experience to our customers. With our digital transformation, we are not only looking at providing financial solutions digitally but also fulfilling the needs and aspirations of our customers as well.? Elaborating on customer convenience, Harsha noted: ?Seylan Bank is continuously working on improving its back end and customer touch points to offer a frictionless, convenient and secure banking experience. Our IT team consists of highly competent industry experts who have been in the financial industry and are focused on developing innovative solutions that will further improve our customers? User Experience (UX) and e-banking platforms to offer customers a rich and convenient digital banking.?
Commenting on the security aspect, Harsha added: ?We have made a significant investment to design and implement state of the art security systems to ensure that our digital platforms are exceptionally safe and reliable, so our customers can transact with peace of mind. As an example, towards offering highly secure digital banking solutions, our ATM?s and POS terminals are EMV certified and we have adopted global best practices to ensure the highest level of security standards. We are also pleased to announce that Seylan Bank was the first bank in Sri Lanka to go-live with the LankaPay EMV certification. Therefore customers of any bank can utilise any of Seylan Bank?s ATMs to carry out their day to day transactions with zero concern.?
Harsha continued: ?Our payment systems comply with Payment Application Data Security Standard (PA DSS) and our infrastructure is PCI - DSS aligned. Staying relevant and up to date with modern security requirements is a challenging process, and it requires continuous research and development to adopt new approaches and technology to keep abreast with the modern threats. It is in this backdrop that we have invested and deployed state of the art security architectures to ensure highest levels of security and to deliver cutting edge digital services. The bank is committed to provide state of the art technology and superior experience to our customers continually.?
Whilst discussing Mobile Banking, Harsha stated that ?Mobile banking is the future and a significant focus will be given to mobile banking as it has become a game changer in the banking industry by providing banking in your palm. We have aligned our services with digital banking to offer efficient banking facilities at a single touch to our customers. While we continue to have SMS banking for our customers that don?t use smartphones, we strongly believe that the future of banking heavily relies on smartphones and we are optimising our mobile platforms towards this end.? However for customers who are more comfortable in working on larger screens we offer a state of the art Internet Banking facility, where ease of use, security and offerings are continuously being enhanced. Therefore, we have leveraged our digital banking products and services to transform the digital banking ecosystem to a whole new paradigm.? Commenting on the overall value of technology and how it empowers the staff of the organisation, Harsha in his closing statement said: ?From leadership planning to customer convenience, our plans are developed in a way that technology becomes the core enabler across all pillars of Seylan Bank?s strategy. Driving this growth, we are able to empower our employees with modern technology and enable them to deliver a more unique experience to our customers in every single way.?

Govt. to suppress opponents by creating Police State: Namal
	
The unity government is attempting to suppress its political opponents at the upcoming Local Government elections by creating a Police State, MP Namal Rajapaksa said today.
He said this after arriving at the Organised Crimes Prevention Division to record a statement over an alleged incident of insulting an FCID officer.
The FCID officer had reportedly lodged a complaint against MP Rajapaksa on the charges of being fat-shamed by him.
However, Mr. Rajapaksa said according to Minister John Amaratunga, the government beefed up its security with arms and police protection in preparation for the upcoming election.
?I was informed by the media that the driver of Minister Sajith Premadasa was arrested for possessing arms. However, he had been released on bail. I would like to know on what condition the suspect was bailed as possessing arms is a grave offence,? he said.
On a different note, Mr. Rajapaksa said the government?s foreign policy depended on an insect.
?The government has messed up its foreign policy. President Maithripala Sirisena boasted about banning Asbestos as they were cancerous. Recently, a beetle was found in a consignment of tea shipped to Russia and it resulted in Russia banning Ceylon tea. Against this backdrop, the President is attempting to lift the ban on Asbestos,? he said. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

The doctor got further disconcerted when he learnt that that the man had come prepared to deliver a talk as well. So he decided to nip it in the bud.?
Walking up to the lectern, the doctor addressed the gathering, ?Now you are to listen to the last but the most important speaker for the day, Our much respected leader??
The message conveyed went truly home for the disappointment was clearly writ on the faces of several bigwigs including that of the latecomer.?

Miracle at St. Anne?s Church, Wattala
	
Miracles occur in every religion and they certainly take various forms. From a Catholic perspective, a miracle is defined as an extraordinary welcoming effect wrought by God that surpasses the power and order of nature. Such an incident was recently reported from St. Anne?s Church in Wattala, where droplets of sweat were seen running down the forehead of a picture of Jesus Christ.? ?
In an interview with Daily Mirror, the Parish Priest of St. Anne?s Church, Rev. Fr. Sanjeewa Mendis said the incident that took place in the church was a miracle.
The Parish Priest said the droplets of sweat had been flowing from the picture since October this year.? ?
Rev. Fr. Mendis said the picture of the Saviour, which was kept in the house of a woman named Niromi Amarasinghe, was brought to the church after the supernatural occurrence continued.? ?
Rev. Fr. Mendis said the picture of the Saviour, which was kept in the house of a woman named Niromi Amarasinghe, was brought to the church after the supernatural occurrence continued
?The picture was brought to Sri Lanka by a group of priests who came here 12 years ago from Chalakkudi, India. The priests had distributed several pictures to the Catholics of the area who attended prayer sessions. However, the tear-like droplets had been flowing in the picture that was kept in Niromi?s house,? the Parish Priest said.? ?
Meanwhile, Niromi said she witnessed the droplets of sweat rolling down the forehead of the picture of Christ from time to time.?
The miraculous incident has further deepened the faith of all Christians. It has motivated them to believe that the Lord is truly present amongst us. I notice that more and more people throng and pray before the miraculous 
picture?Rev. Fr. Mendis
?
?
Fr. Mendis also said a similar incident had taken place in the parish of His Holiness Pope Francis, where droplets of blood was found from a statue of Jesus Christ.? ?
?Following the said incident, the blood had been tested to check whether it was similar to the blood group of Jesus Christ. Subsequently, it was proved that the blood shed from the statue was of the same blood group as Jesus Christ (AB+),? Rev. Fr. Mendis said.? ?
Some prominent miraculous incidents that have occurred in Sri Lanka;
nHoly Cross Church at Marawila - The holy face of Jesus Christ appeared on the crucifix placed inside the church? ??
St. Mary?s Church at Payagala - Appearance of Mother Mary? ?
	The holy face of Jesus appeared on a wall at Kandana? ?
	St. Mary?s Church at Nayakakanda - Mother Mary appeared inside the church? Opinion of laymen Ushantha Rajapaksha, a layman who flocked to witness the miracle at St. Anne?s Church in Wattala, said the droplets of sweat that shed from the forehead of the image were actual tears of Jesus who was crucified and resurrected.? ?
?I presume this will be a significant message from the Lord to renew the life of the people. At the same time, Jesus invites us to avoid what is bad and to embrace what is good, so that we will be able to experience the presence and love of God,? he said? ?
Another layman, Shirani Nirmala, said it was a symbol to signify that Jesus Christ was dwelling among us.? ?
I noticed the changes and showed it to my mother. We then decided to inform the Parish Priest about it. We were advised to bring the picture to the church. We had many family problems and they all gradually settled when the miracle started to occur. Ever since this miracle occurred, I have experienced some strange feelings which are hard to explain. This has strengthened our faith?
?
Niromi Amarasinghe, who first witnessed the miracle
?I could not believe my eyes when I was praying before the image. It was miraculous. My faith in the Lord deepened,? she said.? ?
?If we understand the reality that Jesus is asking us to change our lives, we will be able to experience a genuine transformation within us and through the grace of God,? said Mrs. Pinto, another layman.??

President is not in line with policies of government: GL
	
President, Maithripala Sirisena was doing the role of the opposition by publicly criticizing the government policies, chairman of the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP), Prof. G.L. Peiris said yesterday.
Addressing a news briefing, he said none of the past executive presidents had criticized in such a manner as the incumbent president was doing.
?It is evident with the occasions where the President has publicly announced its displeasure over certain policies of the government like the reduction of the tax of beer. We don?t recommend the act of the President. This depicts that the President is not in line with the policies of the government,? Prof. Peiris said.
Meanwhile, he said the restriction imposed on Sri Lankan tea by Russia would have an enormous impact on the economy of the country as Russia was the largest buyer of Sri Lankan tea.
?We should not rush into this issue. It is essential to deal in a comprehensive manner with the Russian government about the issue to find out an effective solution. Moreover, the government should work in a diplomatic manner with each other in order to solve the crisis rather expressing contradictory ideas on the particular issue,? Prof. Peiris added.

Royal Navy?s new ?3.1bn aircraft carrier springs a leak
	
?
It is the largest and most powerful warship ever built by the UK... and it?s leaking.??
Launched just weeks ago, the Royal Navy?s new ?3.1billion aircraft carrier has a ?significant? defect ? and could cost millions to repair.??
Top brass on the HMS Queen Elizabeth found the fault ? which affects an inflatable seal around one of the propeller shafts ? during sea trials.??
It is now causing the carrier to take on 200 litres of water every hour. The UK?s largest warship, which is currently in Portsmouth, may have to be moved to a dry dock for repairs. Insiders blamed the leak on Aircraft Carrier Alliance (ACA), the partnership that built the vessel.??
As ACA delivered HMS Queen Elizabeth to the Navy with the fault, the company will have to pay the cost of repairs.??
Weighing a colossal 65,000 tonnes, the Queen Elizabeth is 919ft long with a flight deck of four acres ? space for three football pitches. It was assembled at Rosyth from nine blocks built in six UK shipyards, including BAE Systems Surface Ships in Glasgow, Babcock at Appledore, Devon, and Babcock at Rosyth.??
The Queen commissioned the warship earlier this month, saying it embodied the ?best of British?.??
The Navy has not had an aircraft carrier since HMS Illustrious was scrapped in 2014. A Ministry of Defence spokesman said: ?An issue with a shaft seal has been identified during HMS Queen Elizabeth?s sea trials; this is scheduled for repair while she is alongside at Portsmouth.?

Seeking divine blessings is an uphill task
	
?
There is a leading politico in the upcountry estate sector who makes frequent visits to Kovils dedicated to the pantheon in the neighbouring country. His latest pilgrimage was to Lord Ayyappan Kovil at Sabrimale in Kerala.?
?
Devotees visiting this Kovil are required to observe the traditional rite of climbing a hill on the way to it, dressed in black. This leading politico too had started climbing the hill to gain access to the Kovil and had trekked only a few yards up the hilly terrain when he found himself too exhausted to proceed any further.?
The politico did not want to climb down nor could he clamber up the steep hill. Meanwhile, a small group of young men had come forward to carry the politico on a palanquin up to the Kovil, of course, for a substantial payment.?
At the Kovil he had conducted a pooja and said a fervent prayer for divine intervention leading to the offer of a high government position of power and authority to him in the near future, they say.?

## Title: SL asylum seeker to be deported from Australia

SL asylum seeker to be deported from Australia
	
A Sri Lankan Tamil asylum seeker has become the first person slated for deportation from Australia? without having his claim for protection even assessed ? after falling foul of the ministerial deadline of October 01 to apply, the Guardian today reported.
The man, who has been given the pseudonym Rajah because he remains at risk of being deported, was placed in handcuffs at Villawood detention centre on Wednesday morning and slated for removal in the evening.
It is believed he will be flown back to Colombo via Singapore. Returned asylum seekers are, almost invariably, arrested at Bandaranaike airport.
Rajah arrived in Australia by boat in 2012 seeking asylum, having fled government persecution after Sri Lanka?s brutal civil war. His lawyers say he has a credible claim of persecution, based on his Tamil ethnicity and family links to the now-defunct separatist military force the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, also known as the Tamil Tigers.
In May the immigration minister, Peter Dutton, announced that all asylum seekers who had not yet lodged their claims for protection with the government must do so by 1 October or they would not be considered at all.
He said some were ?fake refugees? for whom ?the game is up?. ?They need to provide the information, they need to answer the questions and then they can be determined to be a refugee or not,? he said.
Thousands of asylum seekers who had been living in Australia for years had only just had the ?bar? to applying for asylum lifted, and the waiting list for legal assistance at refugee legal centres was more than a year in some cases.
All of the new applications were put through the so-called ?fast-track? process, which removes many of the safeguards and appeals mechanisms.
Rajah struggled to fill out the 41-page application form in English unassisted, and was not able to access legal assistance before the deadline. Seven thousand asylum seekers were told they needed to meet the 1 October deadline. Rajah was one of 71 who failed to meet the cut-off.
With assistance from the Refugee Advice and Casework Service, he lodged an application for protection during October but was told he had missed the deadline and his claim would not be assessed.
His is the first case that has come to public notice of an asylum seeker being forcibly returned to their country of origin without their protection claim being considered.
Sarah Dale, principal solicitor with the Refugee Advice and Casework Service said Australia was setting a dangerous precedent.
?Based on our experience of thousands of cases, this young man has a credible case for protection, an application has been submitted to the department and the department is ignoring that. Their response, in a nutshell, is he failed to meet their deadline.?
But Dale said the deadline was ?entirely arbitrary? and without any justification. ?We told the government, repeatedly, that this would happen, that people, for a number of reasons, would not be able to meet the deadline, and now they risk being returned to a place where they face potential arrest or torture or harm.?
Australia is still legally bound by its non-refoulement obligations under the refugees convention. It cannot return a person to a place ?where [their] life or freedom would be threatened?.
Australia?s department of immigration declined to comment on Rajah?s case, but has commented on the return of Tamils generally, and its non-refoulement obligations.
?Australia does not remove people to Sri Lanka who engage Australia?s non-refoulement obligations,? a spokesperson said last week. ?Australia takes its non-refoulement obligations seriously.?

Sri Lanka embarks on the road towards a less-cash society
	
As the unlimited possibilities of a digital economy increase throughout the world, it is exciting to witness Sri Lanka emerging as a nation participating actively in the digital commerce revolution.
All indicators point to Sri Lanka being ready to embrace the benefits of low-cost, efficient digital forms of payment securely, reliably and easily in a world beyond cash. Given the large cash displacement opportunities available regionally, it can be said that Sri Lanka is well placed to experience the transition from using more cash to one that uses cashless payments with ease - empowering the economy and citizen-centric services while driving financial inclusion and accelerating growth opportunities.
I was able to gain key insights into the enthusiasm among Sri Lankans towards a digital economy when I undertook a week-long tour across Sri Lanka recently as a part of a charity drive, during which I opted to only pay with the card and not use cash. It was an interesting journey, given the challenges but also one that highlighted the optimism of people towards digital payments and the opportunity to expand usage at a wide level of markets. In this connection, the recent YouGov consumer payment attitude study that measured consumer sentiment around digital payments, affirms a growing interest among Sri Lankan consumers (51 percent) in favor of adopting new forms of digital payments. This also indicates a heightened level of awareness, acceptance and adoption of digital payments among consumers.
With over 18 million debit cards and 1.4 million credit cards in circulation as per Central Bank statistics, it is worthwhile to note that 70 percent of the population have access to some form of digital payment. Given a high mobile penetration level, it can be said that Sri Lanka has the potential to become one of the first South Asian economies to truly transition into a digital economy.?
Central Bank figures already seem to confirm a trend of thriving digital payments; an increase of 15 percent in credit cards and 11 percent in debit cards point to a figure of 19.5 percent of total cards in circulation as at mid-2017. It is also imperative to note that transactions done on cards in Sri Lanka last year without cash withdrawals, stood at Rs.290 billion, which includes POS (Point of Sale) and e-commerce engagements.
It can also be said that a growth in internet penetration together with an increased availability of low-cost smartphones could drive the potential for tremendous e-commerce possibilities. With just 4.2 percent of electronic personal consumption expenditure, there is considerable room for growth there. This is significant as digital payments enable individuals, businesses, and governments to engage in transactions efficiently while focusing on growth. For banks, payments providers, financial-technology start-ups, retailers, government and citizens, the potential is remarkable. In this connection, the recent study by Roubini Thoughtlab reinforces that opening up to digital payments may help Colombo obtain US$0.2 billion in net benefits annually, equivalent to three percent of the city?s average GDP. Estimated catalytic impact for Colombo over the next 15 years include 20.4 basis point increase in GDP growth rate and 2.1 percent increase in employment. Once again, this study helps us learn the actual benefits of going cashless for governments, businesses and consumers, stimulating long-term economic growth in the process.
We at Visa believe that the time is now to seize the opportunity ? undoubtedly, digital payments have the ability to transform the economic prospects of millions of people while empowering small businesses through actual financial empowerment. This process can be strengthened through the consolidation of three building blocks: enhancing widespread mobile and digital infrastructure, creating a dynamic business environment for financial services, and paving the way for digital payment innovations that meet the needs of individuals and small businesses in ways that are bigger, convenient and secure.
Of course, making this vision a reality would mean expanding secure access points, while offering consumers more choices that empower their lifestyles. Sri Lanka today engages with global markets while the retail sector is planning for more growth opportunities. The expansion of the tourism industry with more hotels and restaurants coming up would mean enhanced digital payment options. All of which would mean the need to expand the usage of digital payments which will contribute towards bolstering the economic potential.
As Sri Lanka looks to a future of exploring unlimited opportunities, it is good to focus on enhancing digital connectivity, enable digital identification across markets, secure payment innovations, empower citizen centric services, focus on better digital security while creating a greater sense of digital awareness. However, it is important for all of us to keep in mind that digital transformation is not a technological fix or a one-off plan, or a one-size-fits-all strategy. It is rooted in empowering a shared vision, one in which we can securely embed payments and commerce into any device. In the end, it is all about bringing the global digital revolution closer to meet specific socio-economic priorities through partnerships, innovation, and engagement among all key stakeholders at an economic, social and a community level.

SriLankan loss is greater than 'Aruvakkaru' project: Champika
	
The entire country should urge the government to hand over the SriLankan Airlines to the AirAsia which is a low-cost Airline as the national carrier is a financial burden to the country, Minister Champika Ranawaka said yesterday.
Responding to a question raised at a press conference Minister Ranawaka said SriLankan Airline is continuously making heavy losses.
He said it lost millions in several operations including when purchasing aircraft and it incurred a loss of Rs. 28 billion last year as well.
Minister said that only Rs. 15 billion was spent to construct the Aruwakkaru sanitary land fill to address city's grabage issue and the SriLankan Airline's loss was even greater than the garbage project.
Minister said the present government?s first move was to remove three aircraft purchased during previous government and later approved to remove another four aircraft.
Therefore Minister Ranawaka said that he doesn?t believe that it could be profitable to maintain the SriLankan Airlines further as such a strategic move is required to make a viable business venture.
?Both the SriLankan Airlines and Mihin Lanka became a burden to the country and the previous government should be held the responsible for it,? minister added. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

Suspicious ?Jet A1? fuel conforms to specs: Ministry
	
The Indian Oil Company?s imported stock of suspicious ?Jet A1? Aviation fuel which failed the first quality check has met standards set by the CPC during the second fuel sample testing, the Petroleum Resources Development Ministry said today.
The Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) conducted the second quality test with the participation of independent observers on Sunday (17) where they confirmed the samples were in line with CPC specifications.
Issuing a statement, the ministry said the rust in the oil tanker might have contaminated the fuel which could have ensured the stock did not meet specification during the first test. ?
The Ministry said that during the second test, rust might have sunk down to the bottom of the ship as it docked at the Colombo Port, which ensured the fuel samples were cleared and confirmed to be of high quality.
The ministry said it has started to unload the stock this morning. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

The way forward on Constitutional reforms
	
The discussion in the Constitutional Assembly on the interim report of the Steering Committee turned out to be a very positive discussion, where a large number of members of the constitutional assembly expressed their views critically.
There emerged few important positions on which there was wide agreement that will enable the Steering Committee to move on to the next stage of the process to prepare a draft constitution for the consideration by the constitutional assembly.
Positive developments that we notice through the discussion in the Constitutional Assembly on the interim report were:
i. The broad acceptance of devolution of power to the provinces.
ii. Acceptance of the need for a rights-based constitution with the wide chapter on fundamental rights.
iii. The importance of power sharing.
iv. The nature of the state to be unitary with its meaning well defined in the constitution itself with provisions for the protection of the rights of minority groups and marginalized sections of society through entrenched clauses.
v. Equality to be the foundation of the constitution.
It is seen that to proceed from this point to the next stage of preparing a draft constitution, certain important changes in the process is needed to strengthen the process.
It emerged from the discussion that the constitutional reform process is being carried on by a few, giving rights to the serious criticism that the process is not open and lacks transparency.
This drawback in the process has to be corrected at this point of the process to proceed further towards the ultimate step of drawing up a constitution acceptable to all sections of the people. The process has to be broadened to include:
I. In the steering committee even as observers representatives named by the President so that President will be able to play a major role in the process by his being privy to the discussions and decisions of the Steering and/or Drafting Committee and his views being placed before the Steering Committee / Drafting Committee.
II. It is absolutely necessary for the process to acquire legitimacy that there should be a broad consultative committee of persons from civil society (from outside the political community) who has the knowledge, experience, competence and acceptability to make a contribution on issues that may arise from outside the political community.
The nature of the state to be unitary with its meaning well defined in the constitution itself with provisions for the protection of the rights of minority groups and marginalized sections of society through entrenched clauses
For example, people of the calibre of Dr. Jayantha Dhanapala, Dr. Nihal Jayawickrama, Dr. Nessiah, Dr. Selvakumaran, Dr. Uyangoda, Dr. Harini Amarasooriya and Dr. Deepika Udagama to mention few names to explain my point.
The Steering Committee itself should be broadened to include such personalities who can contribute towards the development of a constitution acceptable to a vast majority of the people and more particularly to show that it is not the work of a few but the work of the best minds available, for example, it should include people of the calibre of Dr. Sarath Amunugama, Mahinda Samarasinghe, Iran Wickremaratne, Harsha De Silva, Ajith Perera, Dr. Fernandopulle.
What I would like to highlight is the fact that if the Constitutional Reform Process is to move forward and reach a meaningful end, then it is of vital importance to broaden the process and allow the meaningful participation of a wider section of society. These corrections have to be made today without delay.
There has to be a wider public discussion on the draft constitution if it is to gain legitimacy.

Tibetan culture plays important role in Sino -Lanka Buddhist relations- Prof. Zhang Yun
	
In the wake of criticism in the Western world against China on the situation in Tibet, a delegation of the Institute of History Studies and China Research Centre was in Sri Lanka to brief on the situation there. Director of the Center Prof. Zhang Yun said Buddhism was a major part of the Tibetan culture and that the Chinese Government took efforts to promote that culture as an integral part of Chinese society. International collaboration and academic exchange are key activities of the Chinese Tibetology Research Center. The Center has successfully held three international seminars for Tibetan studies. In 2001, about 220 scholars from 14 countries attended the Beijing International Seminar for Tibetan Studies.
There is distortion of truth by the Western media on the ground situation
	Buddhism has become an important and inalienable part of Chinese society
	We want?Sri Lankan people to understand what we are doing in Tibet
Excerpts from the interview:
Q What is the real purpose of your visit to Sri Lanka?
Our delegation is a Tibetan cultural delegation. We came here as part of a Tibetan cultural exchange programme. Buddhism is a major part of the Tibetan culture. That is the background of this visit. Tibetan culture will play an important role in China- Sri Lanka Buddhist relations.
Q Your visit takes place in the backdrop of Western criticism against what is allegedly being done in Tibet. What is your view?
That is one of the main purposes of our visit this time. That is to introduce our Tibetan culture and introduce our policy on the religion. We want to introduce our policy on the freedom of religion. We want Sri Lankan people to understand what we are doing in Tibet. The perception, expressed by the Western media, has been fed by Tibetans in exile. Of course, there is a distortion of the truth about the ground situation in Tibet.
There was a famous temple in the western part of Sichuan province of China. It is also a Tibetan Buddhist temple. The Central Government of China is renovating it. The Western media have projected such renovation work in a different perspective. It contradicts our real purpose. We do it to preserve the Tibetan culture in that area. The Western countries, or the media for that matter, have distorted facts about such renovation work. In fact, it is projected as if we are destroying that culture.
There was a famous temple in the western part of Sichuan province of China. It is also a Tibetan Buddhist temple. The Central Government of China is renovating it. The Western media have projected such renovation work in a different perspective
Q How do you define religious freedom?
Everyone has the right to decide whether to believe in a religion or not. Everyone has the right to believe in whatever religion he or she likes. Also, everyone has the right to give up his or her religion. Anyone, hitherto remaining as non-religious, has also the right to embrace new religious belief. That is how we define religious freedom.
Q What is the importance of Buddhism to foster cultural ties between Sri Lanka and China?
Chinese monk Fa -Hien spent twelve years in India. He also came to Sri Lanka. By the time, he was more than 70 years old. He had the spirit to explore more and more about Buddhism. He had the spirit to explore different cultures in India and Sri Lanka. At the time of Fa-Hien in Sri Lanka, his vision was to study Vinaya Pitaka among other discourses.
He brought it to China from here and established order among monks there at that time. That is very important for the Chinese. There are historical cultural exchanges. Among them is the arrival of Fa-Hien monk.
Q In developing the Chinese identity, how important is Buddhism?
Throughout history, we have three kinds of doctrine dominating our society. One is the Confucianism. It is more about politics and daily life of people. The other two are Taoism and Buddhism. Taoism is China?s own religion. Buddhism came from India and played an important role in the Chinese culture. Buddhism has a lot of influence on the daily life of Chinese society. Buddhism has become an important and inalienable part of Chinese society.
Q What is your impression about Buddhism in Sri Lanka?
I do not know much about Sri Lankan Buddhism. But, I know it has had a lot of influence on people here in instilling discipline and harmony among people.

Vandalizing an archaeological site in EP: Dept.vows to take legal action
	
The Department of Archaeology sought a report on the incident in which an archaeological site was vandalized in the Eastern Province on December 18, and vowed to take strong legal action against those responsible, an official said today.
Director General of Archaeology Prof. P. B. Mandawala told Daily Mirror yesterday he instructed the Assistant Commissioner of Archaeology, in charge of the area, to pay a visit to the vandalized site in the Trincomalee district yesterday and submit a report.
He said the Prime Minister?s office also made inquiries about it. He said the police investigations were on, in this regard.
Earlier, different civil society movements raised alarm about the continuous destruction being done to the Buddhist archaeological remains in the eastern province.
The Archaeological team discovered this site only on Sunday. However, it had been bulldozed the very next day by a group unidentified so far. At the site, there were archaeological remains of an ancient ?Dagoda? built during the Anuradhapura Era. (Kelum Bandara)

Vendom to make pleasure seekers think safe
	
Sri Lanka to install Smart Condom Vending Machines
Sexuality is part of what makes us human. In addition to its fundamental function of procreation, sex is also about sensual pleasure. 
According to psychology, many people long for this physical connection when trying to overcome their sense of alienation, isolation and loneliness. 
Although Asians end up with one partner in their life, the drive for sex would be different in people. 
In seeking sensual pleasure, people would often opt for unsafe sex methods which would lead to Sexually Transmitted Diseases (STDs) and other? complications.? ?
As a means of putting a halt to this phenomenon, various programmes were initiated in Sri Lanka as well.
One such successful venture was the establishment of the Family Planning Association (FPA). While addressing various concerns in relation to sexual life and other matters the FPA has come a long way since its inception. Recently, the FPA introduced a Smart Condom Vending Machine in order to break stereotypes when purchasing the products and to promote the concept of safe sex in a broader perspective.? ?
The Daily Mirror caught up with Thushara Agus, Executive Director of FPA, who shared her views regarding this bold initiative. She also spoke about the stigma associated with sexual matters and their future projects.? ?
?Colombo has a night life and one of our main objectives is to prevent the spread of Sexually Transmitted Diseases (STDS)
	There?s a range of condoms and a lubricant available in the machine. We have identified 10 locations within the Colombo city limits where these machines will be installed
	The Smart Condom Vending Machine (ingeniously named Vendom) will serve the purpose of purchasing your needs without having to go through the ?embarrassment?

The FPA was initiated back in 1953 as a volunteer-led organization to address issues pertaining to family planning, as the name suggests. ?There was a high maternal mortality rate at the time and families used to have more than five children,? recalled Thushara. ?Therefore the FPA responded to this growing concern and by the 1960s the Government took over the activities. The association conducted free family planning services through its maternal and child health programmes and these services are still available to date,? she explained.? ?
At present the FPA is an expansive and well-known NGO in the country that has extended its services to Sexual and Reproductive Healthcare (SRH) and welfare as well. The FPA believes that reproductive health is a fundamental right of every woman and man in the human life cycle. As such some of the key areas it focuses on includes providing adequate information and services, training and interventions, seeking to improve the acceptability, accessibility and the quality of SRH and to integrate human rights based and gender sensitive approaches.? ?
?Although the programme was introduced as a fully-fledged approach, we identified pockets of people who were underserved,? says Thushara further elaborating on the need for these services. ?A vulnerable group included young people who didn?t want to have safe sex and sexually active elderly people. Therefore we introduced a programme introducing contraceptive methods such as Prithi and Mithuri which did well in the market. Still there?s a stigma revolving around the purchase of condoms. People are unwilling to articulate the name and instead would gesture the sign on the Prithi packet. After repeated results we decided to install the vending machine. One of these machines was installed back in 1980s, but we failed because the machine was vandalised,? she reminisced.? ?
Vendom?
By the 1980s Sri Lanka wasn?t a tech savvy nation to get used to automatic methods of purchasing items. Having a conventional mind-set it wasn?t easy to buy a condom over the counter. But times have changed and the vending machine is a timely piece of technology. The Smart Condom Vending Machine (ingeniously named Vendom) will serve the purpose of purchasing your needs without having to go through the ?embarrassment.?? ?
?Colombo has a night life and one of our main objectives is to prevent the spread of Sexually Transmitted Diseases (STDS),? stressed Thushara. ?Consumer markets are getting automated and a local manufacturer came forward to help us in this vending machine venture. It?s a cashless transfer and we don?t have to worry about another vandalized machine. The customers will be charged a nominal price for their purchases and since it?s a telephone transaction it will be quite confidential too. Another advantage is that the bill produced will not indicate a description of the purchase.
There?s a range of condoms and a lubricant available in the machine. We have identified 10 locations within the Colombo city limits where these machines will be installed. The next location will be near the National STD Control Programme premises. So far we have been receiving a positive response especially through social media. Once the machine got installed there was a hype created and we are positive about this initiative in our forward march to end AIDS by 2025,? she stressed.? ?
With a few simple steps people can now purchase a condom through the machine. To make things easier, the steps are included in all three languages. For the time being, only Dialog customers can make use of this service, but in time to come, other telecommunication services will be introduced. Unprotected sexual activity is the reason behind many STDs and once acquired, patients experience a disturbed social and family life. The machines will also be installed in coastal areas and in places that attracts a vibrant tourist market. As such Galle and Hikkaduwa will be two other locations out of Colombo where these machines will be available in future.? ?
FPA will celebrate 65 years of service next year and we are planning to extend our services in various other areas and make life easy for everyone
Stigma
The topic of sex is never discussed, at least in the Asian context. People prefer to have their intimacies behind closed doors and in an event that any complications arise; they still prefer to remain tightlipped. Inheriting a colonial mind-set, Sri Lankans too are part of this section. As mentioned by Thushara herself, people prefer to gesture a sign rather than ?ask? for a condom when at the counter. When asked about this backwardness in discussing about sex-related matters Thushara said that her view is two-pronged.
?The culture prevents us from being open about sexual matters. I see a positive side in this mindset because if we were a sexually liberated society, people would end up having multiple partners and the spread of STDs would have been quite high. In that aspect, the cultural barrier should be given its due credits. Another aspect we need to focus on is that there?s an adventurous section of people in our society. They could be women or men. If not protected they will end up having STDs and will also be carriers of these diseases which would be an added risk to the already existing problem,? she affirmed.? ?
Speaking further she said that if men have impotence or other sexual dysfunction, they can speak to a doctor. ?We also have a service called ?Happy Life? where a doctor could be consulted over the phone if you have any problems relating to your sexual life. Callers can be anonymous and their confidentiality is ensured. Therefore I believe that cultural protection is good especially with this increasing urban population,? said Thushara.? ?
Comprehensive sexuality education?
Speaking about the Comprehensive Sexuality Education programme introduced to the school curriculum Thushara said that the Education Ministry should be given credit for this initiative. ?I believe that this is quite an effective step towards progress. But there?s also a concern about this topic not being delivered to 60% of the students.?
This is because sexual education is a component of the health science subject which 60% of students consider as an alternative subject. Therefore only about 40% of students will actually learn it in school.?
Hence a lot of improvements need to be done in advocating sexuality education to students. This is one of the main mechanisms which we could use in reducing sexual violence,? she added.? ?
The Sectoral Oversight Committee on Women and Gender of the Parliament of Sri Lanka launched a curriculum on Comprehensive Sexuality Education in May this year. The curriculum was piloted to Advanced Level students studying at schools in the Western province with an aim to expand it to other provinces in the future. Through this programme, young people will be able to protect their health, well-being and dignity. Some of its fundamental topics include gender, sexual and reproductive health, HIV and STIs, sexual and reproductive rights, prevention of violence and diversity and relationships.? ?
?
Counselling services and the way forward
Airing her views about the prevalence of HIV, Thushara said that Sri Lanka had had a low prevalence rate with HIV for the past 30 years. ?We didn?t have a so-called explosion of HIV patients. It was as low as 0.01% of the population. After we came across the first HIV infected patient we took the initiative to promote the concept of contraceptive methods and safe sex approaches. There were various targeted interventions focused on people who were at risk. Through awareness people now know that they can lead a positive life even with HIV. But we always try to prevent people acquiring STDs. As mentioned before, we are working towards ending HIV in 2025 and as such the FPA has taken an active role in this task,? she said.? ?
The FPA also conducts counselling services. Through their Alokaya Counselling Centre, the Association provides family counselling which is a crucial area of interest. Others include counselling on sexual matters taken in the form of individual or group sessions along with awareness programmes for the public and even Voluntary Counselling and testing for HIV. The Centre is equipped with counsellors qualified in mental health services.? ?
In her concluding remarks, Thushara said that families need to be together. ?We see that children and parents are distracted by electronic gadgets, which is not a good sign. The family should maintain its harmony in order to contribute to the overall well-being of its members. Hence, the FPA thrives to be your choice of place to go to in case of an issue concerning your family life. We are geared to provide a holistic approach in countering issues related to SRH services. FPA will celebrate 65 years of service next year and we are planning to extend our services in various other areas and make life easy for everyone,? said Thushara.? ?
