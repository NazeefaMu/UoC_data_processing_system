Allow me to carry out duties as SLFP Chairman: Maithri
	
	President Maithripala Sirisena today requested that he be allowed to carry out the duties as the Chairman of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP).
	He made this statement at the special workshop for SLFP electorate and district organisers held at the Sri Lanka Foundation Institute today.
	?As I remember, former President Chandrika Bandaranaike handed over the Party to former President Mahinda Rajapaksa and didn?t interfere because the party was handed over to carry out duties. Mr. Rajapaksa handed the party over to me so I should be allowed to carry out the duties. I have to make that clear,? President Sirisena said.
	The President said he said ?Yes? when Mr. Rajapaksa asked whether he accepts the Party but however President Sirisena had said that he needed to appoint a new set of office bearers.
	?Democracy has been ensured after I became the President of the Party. People are entitled to express freely now, which is a positive outcome. For the first time in the history, I witnessed the Party President being challenged by the members recently,? he said.

Video: Appointment of Kshenuka, a bad precedent - JVP
	
While claiming the appointment of former External Affairs Ministry Secretary Kshenuka Senaviratne as the High Commissioner to Thailand sets a bad precedent, the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) today urged the Ministry to probe the allegations against Ms. Senaviratne.
JVP General Secretary Tilvin Silva said the United National Party (UNP) was in the lead of levelling charges against Ms. Senaviratne when she was the Secretary.
?Today, the UNP government has appointed her to a diplomatic post. This is absurd. It had insulted the opinions of the people,? he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Video: CID gets statement from Danuna
	
	Based on a Court Order, the CID today recorded a statement from former Army Commander Sarath Fonseka?s son-in-law Danuna Tillekaratne with regard to the Hicorp deal which hit media headlines some years ago.
	It was alleged that Hicorp International had earned undue profits through arms procurement deals for the Sri Lanka Army at the time General Fonseka was the army commander.
	Danuna, who had been in hiding since 2010 after a court case was filed against him on the Hicorp deals surfaced in December last year.
	He rejected the charges levelled against him and said he would reveal where he was hiding once the court cases against him were concluded.
	?These accusations against me are baseless. They were made out to intimidate General Fonseka during the 2010 presidential election. I surrendered to the Courts at the most appropriate time because I wasn?t the centre of attention during 2015 presidential election,? he said.

Police investigations on Gota over Lanka Hospitals
	
The Police Financial Fraud Investigation Division (PFFID) has launched an investigation into a financial fraud that is alleged to have taken place between 2009 and 2014 at the Lanka Hospitals Corporation PLC under the chairmanship of former Defence Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa.
The PFFID informed Colombo Additional Magistrate Nishantha Peiris that the investigations were based on a complaint lodged by Dr. Neomal Alexander Perera, a cancer specialist attached to the Lanka Hospitals. ?
The Magistrate directed the police to file an investigation report in Court on June 4.
In his complaint, Dr. Perera said that Mr. Rajapaksa was appointed as the Lanka Hospitals Chairman after Sri Lanka Insurance reverted to government ownership after 65.14% shares were acquired by the state.? ?
The complainant said Mr. Rajapaksa took control of the affairs of the hospital and was responsible for a financial fraud amounting to Rs.600 million that took place after artificially manipulating the price of a Lanka Hospital shares at the stock market.
The complainant said Mr. Rajapaksa was also responsible for the rapidly increasing costs incurred on the board of directors amounting to Rs.12 million in 2014.
He said a fraud of Rs.350 million had been taken place when the hospital set up the LHD Diagnostics Laboratory and that several irregularities had occurred when purchasing two houses by the Lanka Hospitals without following a proper tender procedure. (Lakmal Sooriyagoda)

Poll after April 23 under caretaker Govt: UNP
	
	As this government has no mandate to govern the country after April 22, Parliament would be dissolved soon after April 23 and a general election held under a caretaker government Deputy Foreign Minister Ajith P. Perera said today.
	He said the government was confident that by then the Constitutional and Electoral Reforms would be introduced with the draconian powers of the executive presidency pruned and the proportional electoral system replaced by a mixed electoral system.
	The deputy minister said these changes were among the pledges given by President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe during the presidential poll campaign and also included in the 100-day programme.
	?The President and the Prime Minister are of one mind with regard to the dissolution of Parliament shortly after April 23 and general elections held under a caretaker government. The leader of the political party which has the largest number of members in Parliament will be appointed as Prime Minister and the leader of the political party which secures the second largest number of seats is to be appointed as the Deputy Prime Minister,? he said.
	He added that the incumbent government had not received a mandate for 6 years but a temporary mandate up to April 22 and therefore the government had no right to remain in power after April 23.
	The deputy minister said the government was confident that Elections Commissioner Mahinda Deshapriya would work out the modalities required for the mixed electoral system such as the demarcation of the electorates and other matters required to hold a general election within the stipulated timeframe.
	?Constitutional and Electoral reforms were popular demands during the presidential poll and voters gave a mandate to President Sirisena to introduce those reforms through his 100-day programme. The people were fed up with absolute and unfettered power concentrated in the hands of the executive presidency resulting in the vital pillars of democracy such as the Parliament and the Judiciary turning out to be mere rubber stamps. The then Parliament had to pass only the missives forwarded by the Presidential Secretariat and the Treasury. The Judiciary too was under the thumb of the President,? he charged.
	The deputy minister said he was confident that the main opposition, the United People?s Freedom Alliance (UPFA) would support the Government?s action plan with President Sirisena heading the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) and the UPFA.
	The entire exercise of constitutional and electoral reforms was to delegate the excessive powers of the executive presidency to the Legislature and the Cabinet so as to prevent questionable characters becoming people?s representatives ultimately lead to cleaner politics free of corruption, fraud, highhandedness and other misdeeds.

Rajiva sits in the opposition
	
	Former State Minister of Higher Education, Dr. Rajiva Wijesinghe crossed over to the Opposition today criticizing the removal of members of the University Grants Commission (UGC) and the procedure followed in appointing new members to it.
	Dr Wijesinghe in special statement in Parliament said the cabinet ministers had hoodwinked him by telling him that he will be allowed to run the higher education sector but in the end removed the members of UGC. He said the minister informed him that the President had wanted UGC members removed. However, the state Minister said the President had denied this when he inquired from him.
	Dr. Wijesinghe also said he was never given an opportunity to discuss these matters with the Prime Minister.
	Coming up with more allegations the former state minister said he was asked to select members for the UGC from a list which was supposed to have been at the Prime Minister?s Office. "How did such a list go to the Prime Minister? This is not the way to run the government," he said.
	Dr Wijesinghe said he is opposed to the Gazetted constitutional amendments as it was not the proposals which the cabinet agreed upon on Sunday and pointed out that replacing the executive presidency with an executive premier was dangerous.
	Dr. Wijesinghe said he would support President Maithripala Sirisena though he crossed over. "I don't want to sit with the ministers," he said while crossing the floor.
