## Title: Let the children speak and let us give an ear to their voices

Let the children speak and let us give an ear to their voices
	

ive me four years to teach the children and the seed I have sown will never be uprooted these were the words of Soviet leader Vladimir Lenin regarding children, and throughout the years, it is considered as a worldly truth for a child who is brought up in a good environment and is taught good social values and mannerisms. A proper education will never go astray.
A childs mind is full of imagination,creativity and dreams, not knowing the evil ways of the world. He/she is unassuming, innocent and genuine. Children are considered as gifts of God and it is every parents dream to bring up a healthy and educated child. But all children may not be that fortunate. Some maybe born with certain physical disabilities. But they do not mean the children are abnormal. We see in todays society how these children are being labelled as physically or mentally handicapped. Wherever they go they draw attention and often receive only sympathy - instead of the understanding and acceptance they need. These children are equally talented and skilled as any other child. Children with slow learning (dis)abilities may need more time to get accustomed to the learning pattern but would be able to catch up with all the activities if directed to a proper school for the physically handicapped. Hearing impairment is one such disability. But hearing impaired children are much more advanced because of their quick learning and being able to do all activities as any other child. The traditional methods include sign language, Braille and speech therapy. The number of visually and hearing impaired students in Universities has increased due to successful training and some tend to do higher studies and even hold responsible positions in their workplaces. 


The Daily Mirror had the opportunity of visiting the Centre for Education of Hearing Impaired Children (CEHIC) at Dalugama in Kelaniya. It is located in a calm and quiet area and away from the hustle and bustle of the city. The Schools surroundings and classrooms reminds one of the schools mentioned in the book, Totto Chan  The little girl at the window written by the Japanese Television personality and UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador, Tetsuko Kuroyanagi.This was translated into Sinhala later. The book is based on the values of the unconventional education that Kuroyanagi received at Tomoe Gakusen, a Tokyo elementary school founded by educator Sosuku Kobayashi. It conveys the message, apart from the educational values, social values and mannerisms too count in a childs behaviour. We had an interesting discussion with Rev. Sister Greta Nalawatte, the Founder and Directress CEHIC set up in 1982. Around 75 hearing impaired children are being trained under her guidance and a dedicated teaching staff. She had the brainchild of starting this amazing project at a time when hearing impaired children were isolated and often neglected, as deaf and dumb. A friendly and a dynamic nun with a charming smile, spoke to us on how she started a school which was of an international standard, completely free of charge, having all the necessary equipment with the latest teaching methods.
Rev. Sister Greta said, to label a child with hearing impairment as handicapped or abnormal is an injustice. Being hearing impaired or hearing challenged does not mean that a child is backward. These children are intelligent, with a variety of talents and they have the potential to achieve great things. None of us is perfect. Until we die, we all perhaps try to achieve perfection and personal fulfilment. Like us, a hearing impaired child is potentially perfect. 


The school itself is a pleasure to visit because of its beautiful surroundings and interior, well maintained garden and the spick and span class rooms, laboratories, library, music room, art room and other units. This is perhaps the only pre-school which has all the modern facilities - both technical and educational - modern methods of teaching, learning and extracurricular activities. It has 10 children between the age group of 8 months and 2 years in its Early Intervention Programme. One parent, usually the mother, sits with the child in the classroom and learns the teaching techniques alongside the child. The school has classes up to grade five. In its 33-year history, more than 560 hearing impaired children from the CEHIC have been integrated to the mainstream educational system through various schools throughout Sri Lanka. The integrated children who live within a reasonable travelling distance attend daily classes in the afternoons. There are trained teachers who teach subjects such as Mathematics, Science, Social Studies, Sinhala, English or Tamil from year One onwards. The CEHIC students who are preparing for their O/Level and A/Level exams are given extra help during weekends apart from their regular weekly afternoon classes. And above all, the children and their parents are taught about cleanliness and to care for their Centre, its premises, grounds and equipment. 


There are classes for various arts and crafts - sewing, dressmaking, cookery, carpentry, pottery, music, dancing and also a western band. The CEHIC children have also excelled in sports. The Centres Gymnastic team has achieved a higher status of excellence and has taken part in many national events over the years. The children are also taken on field and educational excursions occasionally. Trained teachers and experts such as reputed university lecturers, lawyers and artistes pay frequent visits to conduct programmes and workshops in their relevant subjects. Annual events such as parents day, childrens day and teachers day are held. In addition to those, festivals such as Vesak, Poson and Christmas are celebrated with friendship, harmony and devotion. 
Rev. Sister Greta always had one ambition. That was to help the needy and the less privileged. She had first joined the Catholic Congregation with the Sisters of Perpetual Help. They had run the St. Josephs School for the hearing impaired at Ragama for more than 80 years. She qualified as a Teacher in Special Education from the Teachers Training College in Maharagama. At that time, the most popular method used was the sign language. Sr. Greta was searching for some other modern and experimental method instead of the traditional system. She was so disappointed with the negative response that it led her to the brink of giving up the Deaf Education field altogether.


However, the encouragement of Rev. Fr. Aloysius Pieris S.J. and Rev. Fr. Oswald Firth OMI, had made her change her mind. She reflects with a smile that without the help and guidance of Rev. Fr. Pieris this would not have been an easy task. She was fortunate to get a scholarship from Japan where she received pre-school training for hearing impaired children based on Auditory Verbal Techniques. This encouraged her to pursue further her ambition of achieving what she wanted  a new method of education for hearing impaired children and to start a pre-school.
Though she had to leave Ragama, the childrens parents had their trust in her and somehow got her a position as the teacher-in-charge of a special unit at the Kirillawala Maha Vidyalaya. Earlier it was hard to convince the parents and the area residents to send their hearing impaired children, since they were of an opinion that she had come to convert them to Christianity. However, upon the request of Ven. Silogama Vimala Thera and the Principal of Kirillawala Maha Vidyalaya A. Ranasinghe, the number of children gradually began to increase. She then realized that her dream of integrating hearing impaired children would fail unless they were given a better pre-school training. She searched for a suitable place to start her school and a good Samaritan lady in the area donated her dilapidated house at Ranmuthugala, closer to the Kirillawala Govt school. This later expanded, and since the recruitment of staff and students increased, she moved to Kelaniya where a Muslim parent donated a share of their property at Dalugama in Kelaniya. This had adequate space to start a pre-school. 


The cost of the purchase was met by MISEREOR of Germany, based on the seminal project written by Rev. Fr. Firth at SEDEC in 1982. MISEREOR helped them for many years thereafter. The small school which started with a handful of children in Kirillawala has now grown into a fully equipped pre-school of a highest standard with an environment, especially built for children to learn with comfort and pleasure. There is an observation unit as well as an audiometric and hearing aid laboratory. Each child is admitted to the school after undergoing a hearing capacity test. Moreover, it adopts a special education system which no other school does to make learning a fun and joy for the children. Rev. Sr. Greta said that this pre-school produces children not only with sufficient knowledge, but also with good social manners and knowledge in cleanliness and personal hygiene. She says it is a must for the parent to work with the child, so that he/she too would gain some confidence and knowledge of how to bring up the child and groom him/her to be a disciplined citizen. The teachers are trained by Rev. Sister Greta herself under one-year probationary basis. Volunteers could help but they are not appointed as teachers because it is difficult to run on volunteers involvement alone, as this is an educational institute where much time and dedication are needed. 


Rev. Sr. Greta says these children lack communication and language skills and are not in anyway mentally disabled. The teachers and parents have to play an important role to get this task ahead. Since the technology is more advanced, the teaching methods have become much easier. The institution also conducts training programmes for university students who have their practical training sessions in speech therapy. The parents are giving their fullest support. There are CEHIC integrated students who study at prestigious schools all over the island. This is the only pre-school in Sri Lanka which uses the latest and scientific teaching methods apart from the traditional methods such as sign language. She says there are pre-schools that have mushroomed in every nook and corner. But they do not conduct proper teaching methods and they are only concerned about gaining profits. Everyone has a duty to perform in our school as this is a community school as well. Thus the concept of working as one family has been established. Sr. Greta said with a smile, if there is a good hearing aid and an intelligent mother, the child can go a long way, which means that the mother should have some knowledge, be creative and should be intelligent enough to learn and absorb the methods to guide the child. 
According to Rev. Sister Greta, the main cause for the children being handicapped are blood relationship marriages. For example, marrying first cousins. And some are chronic. If the blood groups do not agree with each other, the couple is prone to bear a handicapped child. The mother should be very careful within the first three months of pregnancy. Bringing up a child is not an easy task without prior knowledge. But she says if a child is brought up properly, and if the parents have the knowledge and preparation, they can give a lovely child to the world, and the child could be groomed to be a good citizen. From their younger days, the CEHIC children are taught to be disciplined and to be clean. So even if a CEHIC child goes to another school after completing five years, he/she would bear special qualities better than the other children who are more knowledgable and disciplined. It was a pleasure to see the children greet us saying ayubowan as we went to each classroom.
Rev. Sister Greta thinks that Sri Lanka has not focused enough on special needs education and does not adopt new training methods as done in countries which are more technically advanced. Those who have a love for this field could join us and the purpose should not be earning money. Before recruiting a child to the school she says We need to console the mother and convince her to train the child. They need a lot of counselling. When they come here for the first time, they are disheartened. But they have to accept the truth and make up their minds. If the parents are intelligent and the child is also creative, there is nothing they cannot do.


The CEHIC has a Board of Trustees, an educational board, and a management board all run by parents. The patrons include Ven. Welamitiyawe Kusaladhamma Thera, Rev. Sister Greta and Rev. Father Pieris SJ. It also includes Prof. Sarath Amunugama, vice chancellor of the Kelaniya University. 
The school is run mostly by donors, and it is a community school, neither a private institution nor a state-owned school. Rev. Sister Greta also has an aspiration of expanding the school in other areas of Sri Lanka. Reflecting on the journey she has come through, she is happy and content and hope to continue with her mission. We spoke to some of the parents and teachers of how they find the development of their children then and now.
Ms. Kumarage from Wanawasala in Kelaniya said that her child joined the school in 2013 and finds it highly successful. It is amazing. The child speaks to a considerable extent. And I feel so confident and happy about sending my child to this school. This is the only school in Sri Lanka which has modern learning methods.


Ruth Nayomi of Kirimatiyagara in Mahara has two children who are hearing impaired. One is 4 years old and the other 11. My son can speak and there is a big difference. Before we found this school, I had no idea of how to educate my child. I was at a loss. The hospital said he had a big hearing loss but directed me to this school. Rev. Sister Greta made a huge dedication to bring him up to at least this level. 
Paba from Bogawantalawa, says that she currently lives in Kiribathgoda. I came to know about this school from my husband, he sold tickets to do our childs surgery. During that time, a relative of a person who works at this school told my husband about this institution. We have been here for three years. I am so happy about my childs progress. He could not even walk properly, but now at least he can speak to a certain extent. There is no other school in Sri Lanka like this. Only God can create a school like this, was her emotional response. 


Lakshman Perera works as the audiometrician of the school and says it is not something which can be bought for money. I came here after seeing an advertisement in the papers recruiting new teachers from the science stream. I am the only one who is still remaining out of all six recruits. When I first came here, most of these buildings were not there. I have been here for 23 years. I am also working as an acting Principal for the school. I am also in-charge of conducting special occasions and festivals. This school is so special because it does not adopt traditional methods such as sign language. I gained a lot of self satisfaction by making my contribution to this institution, which is something money can never buy. 


Noel Kariyawasam is the administrator of the school. He tells us the reason as to why he left a responsible job with an audit firm and joined as an administrator here. This school trains those children who lack in speech and communication skills and train them to speak to a considerable level. The parents who send their children here leave very happily after 5 years. Children from distant places come here. Some parents have given up their jobs to come here. Some are even engaged in minor work. That is worth more than money. The school lacks funds and is run with greatest difficulty. But we somehow manage. 
The THULANA Research Centre for Encounter and Dialogue is considered as the heart of the CEHIC, since everything is administered from there and is sailing under the guidance and blessings of Rev. Fr. Pieris. THULANA was founded by him. He is a leading Asian Jesuit Liberation Theologian and also a Buddhist Scholar. The Centre was established after he witnessed the series of events that led to Marxist-inspired youth insurrection of 1971 in Sri Lanka. He had initiated an apostolate which has responded to two challenges  the challenge of the spirituality and philosophy of Sri Lankas major religion, Buddhism, and the challenge of the socio-political aspirations of the educated but marginalized rural youth. The name Tulana has its roots in the Sanksrit word for discernment. The Centre is a combination of a mini-university, a house for retreat and reflection, a centre for social animation, a forum for inter religious dialogue (mainly Buddhist and Christian) a place for various cultural expressions and exchanges (including Arts, music, film and video), a seat for theological renewal, and a venue for the peripheral people in all walks of life to meet and share experiences in a climate of mutual support. The institution is situated in a peaceful and a remote area at Gonawala in Kelaniya facing a paddy field. The surroundings clearly express the Catholic priests love for nature and its amazing natural habitat. He came here in 1974 and there were only a few inhabitants. But gradually with time, the number of inhabitants began to increase. He found it as a very convenient place and suited his taste. Doing justice to its name, the institution has spread through a vast area of trees, plants, flowers and to the constant chirping of birds could be heard the whole day, which is ideal for recreation and soothes the mind. Which is also ideal for meditation. It is amazing as how he turned out a normal compound into a research centre which is blessed with a well. Even the interior matches with the colours of the nature. Rev. Fr. Pieris says, We learn art from nature. 


Seminars and workshops are conducted regularly at the centre and its members are involved in grassroots animation work with landless and other dispossessed persons such as those affected by environmental destruction and marginalized the globalization process. Artistic activity is also on the Tulana programme and the centre houses a collection of art reflecting its ethos created by some of Sri Lankas leading painters and sculptors. The use of film, video and radio in its ongoing programme of encounter and dialogue began a few years ago with the arrival of its newest permanent member Robert Cruz in 1995. The gentle and soft spoken priest spared some of his time too. He said the CEHIC had a long history and that he helped Rev. Sister Greta to start up the school to liberate these children from being cornered and criticized. The organisations that are ready to help them cannot believe that they are doing all their services for free. He thinks that new methods should be included to the school curriculum.


Earlier Rev. Fr. Pieris recollects that they used to have meetings, such as parents meetings inside the hall. There are libraries that had books of every category, Literature, Philosophy etc. Rev. Fr. Pieris invented the research Centre at a time when he was invited to go to Rome to continue with his theological duties. But he preferred to remain in Sri Lanka. The priest is also an examiner and a University Professor. Politicians just visit, praise the place and go, but nothing happens more than that. That is not enough. More attention and assistance are needed from the relevant authorities, laments Fr. Pieris. 
It was an enjoyable and pleasant time that we spent at the CEHIC and the Tulana Research Centre, walking through the buildings and the artistic surroundings enriched with lovely paintings and sculptures. We gathered a lot of information about the social and charity work which they do with great difficulty. But yet, it is a joy for them to see the happy and innocent faces of the children in the school and the contentment of the parents which is considered the greatest profit they could make.

Maha Sangha has said new Constitution not required'
	
Asgiriya Chapter Mahanayake Most Ven. Warakagoda Sri Gnanarathana Thera stressed that a new constitution was not required and that the Maha Sangha had already informed it to President Mathripala Sirisena .
During a meeting with former Minister and National Freedom Front leader Wimal Weerawansa yesterday at the Asgiriya Temple, the Ven. Mahanayake Thera said they explained their stance regarding the proposed new constitution to the President and Prime Minister and that the President agreed to their opinion.
The NFF Leader and several representatives of the party met the Mahanayake Theras of the Malwatta and Asgiriya Chapters to explain the circumstances that led to five Parliamentarians including him to resign from the constitutional assembly.
The Anunayake Thera of the Asgiriya Chapter said the President informed them that even the draft of a new constitution was not yet ready, but they were not aware whether it was the Prime Ministers opinion as well.
Although the President said so, the government is apparently in the process of promulgating a new constitution. However, we told him that we would not agree to a process delegating more powers to the provincial councils. Chief Minister Wigneswaran has insisted that the Northern province should have a a federal system. It is inevitable that the other provincial councils would demand a system with similar powers. With this in view we highly appreciate the step taken by you to resign from the constitutional assembly Ven. Anunayaka Thera said.
Parliamentarian Wimal Weerawansa said they decided to resign from the constitutional assembly in the wake of the Mahanayak Theras statement that a new constitution was not required at this stage.
 If the Mahanayake Theras were not agreebale to a new constitution, we should not continue to function in the constitutional assembly. We are not prepared to support any move rejected by the Mahanayake Theras. The government empowered the entire parliament represented by 225 members to function in the capacity of constitutional assembly. After five members resigned, the constitutional assembly is defunct now. We have compelled the government to give up the process. Only the individuals having relations with NGOs are behind this secret ploy to transform the country into a federal state. He said.
Later he met the Mahanayake of the Malwatta Chapter Ven. Thibottuwewe Sri Siddhartha Sumangala Thera and discussed on the governments plan to introduce a new constitution. However the media was not allowed to cover his meeting with the Mahayanaka Thera.
Parliamentarian Udaya Pathma Shantha Bandara, Provincial Council Members Nimal Piyatissa, Nimal Premachandra, and Former Parliamentarian Piyasiri Wijenayaka attended the meeting. (J.A.L.Jayasinghe)

## Title: Mahendran's, Palisena's reps allowed to observe data retrieval

Mahendran's, Palisena's reps allowed to observe data retrieval
	
The Presidential Commission of Inquiry (PCoI) yesterday allowed legal representatives of Central Bank's former governor Arjun Mahendran and PTL CEO Kasun Palisena to be present when data was being retrieved from mobile devices and copied by the IT experts at the CID.
Considering all submissions made by the Attorney Generals Department and the Counsel appearing for Mahendran and Palisena, the Commission yesterday delivered a 21-page order in relation to the legal issues raised earlier by counsel.
On an earlier occasion, Chanaka de Silva who appeared for Mahendran made an application seeking permission for Mr. Mahendran's legal representatives to be present during the extraction of data from mobile devices.
Additional Solicitor General Yasantha Kodagoda objected to the application and was of the view that it was not desirable or necessary that a legal representative should be permitted on the basis that internationally such representation was not permitted.
However, the PCoI thereafter permitted both parties to assist the PCoI submitting the names of relevant authorities.
While observing best international practices, it considered Article 19 of the Budapest Convention, the Principle of Proportionality, Evidence Special Provisions Act, Computer Evidence Act, and other appropriate legislation.
The PCoI was of the view that it would permit legal representatives of Mr. Mahendran and Mr. Palisena to be present when the data was extracted and and copied at the CID because it was not prohibited by the law and is not contrary to international best practices.
The PCoI said there was reason to believe that allowing representatives to be present would compromise the process of the extraction and copying of data or prejudice this investigation.
It said it had comprehensively dealt with the legal issues issues raised by Presidents Counsel Kalinga Indatissa earlier that the PCoI had no power to require ones mobile communication devices and computer devices other than when the person was giving evidence.
However, referring to the Section 7 (1) (bbb) of the Commission of Inquiry Act, the Commission said in order to properly carry out the investigation and the inquiry specified in the mandate, the PCoI had the authority to require a person to produce his communication devices prior to that person giving evidence.
With regard to the earlier matter raised by PC Indatissa that the procedure followed by the PCoI up to now was flawed as a result of not having formulated rules; the PCoI was of the view that under the Section 25 of the Act which only reflected discretionary powers vested in the PCoI to make rules, it was not mandatory for a Commission to frame rules.
PC Indatissa said the AG's Department officials who were assisting the PCoI were not permitted to perform such functions under the law since it was only the PCoI which might determine the witnesses to be called and when they are to be called and statements recorded.
However, the PCoI held that the AG's Department officers have been assisting the commission as provided under the Section 23 of the Act and that they were also entitled to appear before it and give evidence under Section 26 of the Act.
Meanwhile, PTL CEO Kasun Palisena continued with his evidence for the fifth day with regard to secondary market transactions which they had engaged in with the EPF directly and through an intermediary in 2015.
The witness was of the view that by May 2015 the market yield rates were sliding because of various macro economic factors and that resulted in the PTL dealing with the EPF in secondary market bonds at a low interest rate.
During his evidence, he also showed that there were other transactions in the secondary market with the EPF and other primary dealers at a similarly low interest rates at this time.
Presidents Counsel Nihal Fernando and Counsel Romali Tudawe who led the evidence on behalf of PTL were of the view that PTL had dealt with the EPF in the secondary market both directly and through switches (or intermediaries) at a market-prevailing rate in 2015.
The counsel also said there were errors in the documentation submitted earlier by the Additional Director of CB's IT Department, Wasantha Alwis as to the methodology he used in calculating losses because some inclusions identified in that document as switches were actually sell and buy back transactions.
However, considering the time constraints, the PCoI yesterday questioned the PTL counsel whether it was necessary to mark and lead all the documents relating to the secondary market transactions since they were already in place before the PCoI.
Is that not superfluous to lead evidence in that way, Justice Prasanna Jayawardena asked.
Deputy Solicitor General Milinda Gunathilake said, It was not superfluous evidence but cosmetic.
However, Counsel Fernando PC was of the view that the Commission was restraining them by leading evidence through every single transaction referring to relevant documents and this could affect his client. He said to prove the wrong matching of the previous document submitted by Mr. Alwis they should be permitted to continue with the way they were presenting their case.
Subsequently, the Commission allowed the PTL Counsel to continue with evidence and requested to speed up the process. (Shehan Chamika Silva)

The repayment tenure of balance transfer is from 3 months to 36 months to suit the cardholders financial commitments. The monthly fee is as lowest as 0.9 percent on the amounts transferred with no other extra charges/interest. This option would be beneficial especially during a time where consumers are most likely to be overwhelmed by credit card bills due to past seasonal spends.
Speaking about the balance transfer option, Zeyan HameedNDBs Assistant Vice President credit cards stated As a bank that is concerned in continuously financially empowering our customers, this option will enable them to ease their credit card burden with this unique proposition.
Whilst credit card brings a whole heap of convenience and value additions, the natural inclination to buy now, pay later at times lead some of us to severely stretched finances whilecredit card bills hit high. Therefore it is advisable to stick to a planned budget which would stop you from overspending and making an effort to pay your credit card balance on time to avoid unnecessary charges.

There are many ways to getting the most from your credit cards rather than having to face unwanted financial pressure. 
While NDB advises you to use your credit card wisely, it also extends its balance transfer option to ease of your financial pressure.

New traffic fines put off till month-end
	
The gazette notice on increasing traffic fines up to Rs.25,000 will be delayed until the end of this month because of loopholes in the Motor Traffic Act (MTA), Chairman of the National Council for Road Safety, Dr. Sisira Kodagoda said today.
Even though the fine for reckless driving has been increased to Rs.10,000, MTA does not give a proper definition of reckless driving and if the gazette notice is issued without rectifying these shortcomings, the police can enforce the law as they wish, he said.
Dr. Kodagoda said they had reduced the fine for speeding to Rs.3,000 in the wake of requests made by several parties, but an additional 20 per cent would be added based on the extent of exceeding the speed limit.
He said the fine for overtaking from the left and using mobile phones while driving is Rs.2,000 and the fine for vehicles driven by minors the fine has been increased from Rs.5,000 to Rs.30,000.
Meanwhile, the maximum fine of Rs.25,000 will be implemented for offences such as driving under the influence liquor or drugs, driving without a valid licence or using those without a driving lisence to drive vehicles, carelessly crossing a railway track and driving a vehicle without valid insurance cover.

No one should interfere with the judiciary: BBS
	
The Judiciary and the Attorney General's Department should be independent and should be allowed to function as such without interference from anyone, the Bodu Bala Sena (BBS) group claimed today.
Addressing the media at the BBS Headquarters in Rajagiriya, Sinhala Ravaya General Secretary Magalkande Sudaththa Thera said no Parliamentarian should be allowed to interfere in cases filed at the Attorney Generals Department or with the Judiciary.
The President, the Prime Minister, ministers and MPs are known to interfere in the justice system, he pointed out, adding No one has the authority to delay or hasten court cases. Justice should be meted out in an impartial manner, Ven. Sudaththa Thera said.
Even in Parliament ministers are known to issue challenges to the Attorney Generals Department, Judges and the Judiciary, which has left the public disillusioned with the Judiciary, he said.
Therefore, the President and the Prime Minister should act immediately to bring disobedient ministers to book inside and outside Parliament, he said. (Chaturanga Pradeep)

Ridiculing AG Dept. an insult to Presidential Commission-BASL
	
Sri Lanka Bar Association President Udaya Rohan de Silva PC, said it was an insult to the Presidential Commission of Inquiry probing the bond issue when outsiders speak about its activities, ridicule them and point fingers at the officers of the Attorney Generals Department.
He said attempts seemed to have been made to violate the trust of the people about the Commission by popularizing the views of various people saying that certain things had happened due to the commission. He said some persons whose corrupt activities have been revealed seem to have attempted to tarnish the image of the rule of the law and its independence.
He said it went to prove that statements made regarding the hiding of 50 files of politicians against whom allegations have been levelled for crimes were done on the need of the Justice Minister. (Manopriya Gunasekera and Ranjan Katugampola)

SDB deploys efficient loan collection mechanism
	
SDB bank has introduced a broader and efficient mechanism to collect loan payments from its customers under the name Tele-collection.
Through this loan review mechanism, the bank will be able to keep tabs on customers and their repayment schedules, while obtaining details on all those who failed to make payments by the deadline.
SDB bank usually offers its loan customers a grace period of four additional days counting from the scheduled date of payment. With the new review system, a phone call is given to the relevant customer from the 5th day onwards to remind on repayment details. The bank also enquires regarding the reasons for the delay and finds means to help them overcome the difficulties and continue repayment.
Commenting on the Tele-collection Service, SDB bank Manager (Loan Repayment) S.H. S. I. Udayangana explained that the customers who failed to regularly make their repayment will be promptly informed and updated on the matter, and provisions will be provided to continue repayment on a regular basis.

The new unit has been established a year ago in conjunction with a series of internal changes made in the SDB bank.
The special mechanism further expedited and streamlined the bank services while facilitating quick access to the required information. SDB bank which was established 20 years ago, currently serves the nation with 91 branchesisland-wide.
In the banking sector, non-performing loan ratio was recorded as 2.6 percent by 31.12.2016 while in specialized banks the amount was recorded as 3.6 percent. However, the non-performing ratio of SDB bank was recorded as 2.1 percent, clearly portraying the success achieved through its unique loan collection system.
Following the investment of world renowned financial bodies SBI, FMO and IFC, SDB Bank has further consolidated its footing and continues to provide a number of services to uplift small and medium scale enterprises in collaboration with government institutions such as Central Bank of Sri Lanka, Ministry of Industry and Commerce, SouthernDevelopment Authority.

## Title: The tragedy of our comedy

The tragedy of our comedy
	
Suhada Koka
The end of tragedy in the West came about with the rise of reason and intellect. As Nietzsche points out in The Birth of Tragedy, Euripides and Socrates were the main culprits. Simply put, they rationalised what couldnt be rationalised. 
But Western tragedy, as Lionel Abel contends in his book Metatheatre: A New View of Dramatic Form, was never the preserve of Western culture. The best playwrights, including not just Aeschylus and Shakespeare, but also Euripides and Racine, were unable to depict characters that lacked self-consciousness. Self-consciousness is what inflates Macbeth, Hamlet, even King Lear. Their awareness of a destiny, of a cruel higher fate ordaining their universe, is what was supposed to compel their tragedy. No, Abel points out: by dramatising these characters and attributing to them a false sense of order, their writers were actually foregoing on their tragic element. 
Self-consciousness is also what epitomises comedy. The basic traits of the Western comic theatre  manipulation, deceit, contortion, and confusion  are to be found in tragedy as well. But what differentiates one from the other is their respective relations with the cinema. The Western tragedy approximates to the Western dramatic film only if the character or protagonist is compelled to break the fourth wall. This is rare, if at all because the cinema, unlike the theatre, believes in distancing the viewer from the plight of its heroes and heroines when the latter are faced with calamity. 
Maya
The worst of the American cinema  by which I include Tommy Wiseaus hilariously unwatchable The Room  breaks this rule, in which case the tragic element is sacrificed, sometimes inadvertently, for the comic. Wiseaus film is terrible because it tries to relate to us his protagonists tragedy (which, because this was a personal work of art, was also his tragedy) with pretensions to a dramatic form. He does not believe in distancing us. He is self-aware. Consequently, its mood deteriorates to a rather bizarre form of comedy. When one indulges in this playful wreckage of genres, one indulges in parody, the kind of parody that has pervaded comedians everywhere. Its a crude, hopelessly prolonged form that leaves us in the dark, groping for more. 
And its exactly that form of parody that has invaded our cinema, our directors, our scriptwriters, our actors. In the Western dramatic film the characters do not break the fourth wall to address us, unlike in a play. They keep us away from their dilemma. The same cant be said of the comedy film. Of comedy and drama in the theatre Susan Sontag (reviewing Abels book) contended that they were best defined in relation to each other. But in the cinema they are pitted against each another. Drama and tragedy lose their theatrical sense of artifice and epicness when adapted to the screen. Comedy and parody do not. Consequently, they are the more unsubtle of the two, and as such dont require a breaking of the fourth wall: they require the assumption that the fourth wall has already been broken even before they begin. And even in the movies. 
The difference between their comedies and our comedies is that in the West, even with the likes of Wiseau and Uwe Boll (whose films transcend their genres in a terrible way), humour never condescends to artifice: it celebrates it (Ill come back to this shortly). The characters are believable even in the most absurd situations. They are cheerfully dumb, which as Sontag points out secures their invulnerability (think of Harold Lloyd dangling dangerously from the hands of a clock high above a street in Safety Last). By contrast, here we neglect the believability of our protagonists. 

The problem with our directors today is that they dont make us laugh with original ideas. They merely recycle the past. And if they cant recycle the past, they recycle the foreign, marketing it as an original. Maya was the inevitable continuation of all those films which had certain superstars as cross-dressers (including Amitabh Bachchan and Shah Rukh Khan). The film inspired a panel discussion after its release, which tried to drive home the point that it was more than what it actually was. Of course, Ranjan Ramanayakes ascent (or descent) into a cross-dressing androgynous hero was worthy of any such point, but then at the end of the day, it was an exercise in recycled parody. 
Wada Bari Tarzan spliced footage from George of the Jungle. This was only to be expected; the production cost would have soared if Tennyson Cooray were to be filmed fighting a digitalised lion. But its shallowness came about precisely because of these slow footed attempts at parody. And it wasnt even a parody of what its title suggested, since the film is closer to the American cinemas own parodies of Tarzan. This parody of a parody, or a parody within a parody, is what our moviemakers have marketed to us as entertainment, and like obedient children, we watch and enjoy it. 
The difference between comedy and parody is the same as the difference between originality and mimesis. Its an extension of the idea of art as a replication of reality, the latter of which makes up the theory of aesthetics from Platos time. So if art is replication, the replication of art is further away from reality, even further away if its a replication of a replication (which is what recycled parody is). Any attempt at approximating to drama that ultimately proves to be unsuccessful is no different, as Wiseaus The Room and Bolls Alone in the Dark show. Its not even art, rather subversion of art, and like all acts of subversion the subversive artiste must be equipped with the necessary tools to transcend the limits of what he or she is doing.
Kolamba Sanniya
The most refreshing comedies from the last five years, including Giriraj Kaushalyas Suhada Koka, dont attempt at recycled parody despite their barely fleshed out plots. Suhada Koka has no original ideas that can distinguish it from those other comedies revolving around Rajamanthri. And yet, because of how well it offers variations on the same plotlines, the same narrative devices (case in point: Rajamanthri hiring his poor cousin as a household servant, in direct contrast to an episode of Ethuma where that same cousin and his mother are denied an audience at his office), it does more than reuse the past. Theres nothing being recycled here. Only refurbished. 
Suhada Koka, like Sikuru Hathe, King Hunther, and Ko Mark No Mark, doesnt belong to the category that most of Ranjan Ramanayakes movies do. The Ranja series, and even a film like Sinhaya (which has him as the guardian of an orphanage), are self-referential. Theres nothing new, not because of a want for new ideas but because Ramanayake has superseded himself so much that he doesnt need to be overtly self-conscious: we know the moment that blast of testosterone-laden music and that bald vigilante sporting sunglasses and an unsmiling face appear that its going to be the same deal. He is no subversive because, given his public image, why should he try to be As with the Tennyson Cooray and Bandu Samarasinghe vehicles, his work is therefore a slapdash rehash of everything youve seen before. 

What is tragic about our comedies, then, is that even the best of them are sometimes subject to the excesses of the worst.
Those excesses arent celebrated, they are condescended to. (This is the real difference between parody and recycled parody.) One notices such a dichotomy even in America: starting from the eighties, the deterioration of comedy into a poor, shoddy mimesis culminated in Epic Hard, Superhero Movie, and the Scary Movie series, all of which force us to enjoy their ill-timed, indifferently lit, and clueless plotlines. One cant be forced to laugh, of course, unless one is provided with cues to guffaw at the correct time. Resorting to such cues is a sign of artistic bankruptcy, though it does bring in dollars or rupees. 
Contrary to popular belief, tragedy never died in the West with Euripides. There was no tragedy in the first place, as Abel points out: all that was there was a form of theatre rooted in the self-consciousness of its characters. If what one takes as tragedy in this respect was similar to comedy, there was no dichotomy between the two onstage. But the cinema was a different art form, which meant that only comedy could subsist on self-consciousness: its greatest strength and weakness. In Sri Lanka, the comedy film has come to rely so much on this sense of self-consciousness that its deterioration to recycled parody could only spell out its death knell. 
At one level, its almost a national tragedy. But are we lamenting I dont think so. In France there was a theatre form that celebrated violence and horror. They called it the Grand Guignol. I rather think that we have transcribed it to our comedies, with the caveat that we have substituted gluttony and excess for gore and erotica.

## Title: Travelling becomes TORTURE as buses blare out degrading music

Travelling becomes TORTURE as buses blare out degrading music
	

When commuting in a bus jam-packed with hundreds of passengers smelling of sweat and struggling to maintain their balance, what tests our patience more than these inconveniences is the deafening music that blares from the vehicles stereo set-up. The question posed by many annoyed commuters is who needs this music Conductors or the bus drivers are sure to enjoy the music played for their entertainment. But such music rarely comes close to what passengers might wish to listen to when travelling by public transport.
Any passenger travelling in a bus has experienced at least once such annoying music. People listen to music for pure enjoyment and to relax. If music played within a bus is disturbing, it indicates in no uncertain terms that someone has stepped over the line. There are songs from the past that can soothe the listener, regardless of the place and the mentality the listener is in. Some of those golden oldies are still played only in a handful of buses in Sri Lanka. The music played in buses at present-which borders on noise rather than the sound produced by a combination of vocal and instruments- shows the poor taste for music of bus drivers and conductors. 
The National Transport Commission states that the maximum volume at which music can be played within a mode of public transport is 80 db (Decibel). Then its questionable how buses (especially the ones travelling long distances) install Hi-Fi buffels within a bus. Often these buffels are installed in many places within the bus which goes on to tell how deafening the music can be inside such vehicles.
When such blaring music is played, commuters can hardly converse. Such music has the potential to trigger a heart attack in a person who has a defective heart. How unhealthy is such music to passengers The Daily Mirror spoke to medical experts and accomplished individuals in the field of music to obtain their views on the subject.
There are no standards related to the human mentality and hearing with regard to public transport. It has been scientifically proven that when sounds reach a figure above a certain decibel they can cause damage to the human ear. Deafening, senseless and distasteful songs played within modes of public transport distort the minds of passengers. Whatever the passengers mentality, they are forced to keep listening to the audible junk while travelling in private buses or three wheelers (tuk tuks). Hence passengers are subject to stress as a result of the repugnant songs. Most of these songs arent welcome at any electronic media channel. Some of these songs are played on buses plying on the popular Matara-Colombo Highway. According to a survey done by undergraduates such songs are demanded by passengers commuting on buses on this popular highway. Most bus drivers and conductors are innocent and are lured to do so by promoters of such songs in return for benefits. There have also been occasions when drivers prefer such loud music because it keeps them awake during long journeys. Inadequate sleep is a health issue that has to be dealt with separately. Playing loud music and disturbing the peace of commuters certainly isnt the solution for this issue.
The present generation of children is exposed to such blaring music at home and when using public transport, hence its a challenge trying to familiarize such individuals to have a taste for classical music. Such efforts are taken during school hours. A large section of the society has been made corrupt by the ignoble taste for music. The rivalries that exist among private radio and television channels have also contributed to this social problem. 
We too attended musical concerts during our childhood, but the experience was totally different compared to today. We could enjoy the melodious music and meaningful lyrics. Even the Baila songs had a depth and the singers and the bands were more disciplined. 
The chaos caused due to the present trend in music is partially a result of subjects like literature and history being removed from the school syllabus. This has promoted a degrading taste for music, something which has caught up in popularity. Decision makers in the country should never count the heads present at a musical show while taking decisions related to culture, Wickramasinghe stressed.
Commenting on the music played in buses he added, Any music played within a mode of public transport has to conform to the specifications regarding the length and width of the vehicles. This is with regard to the sound that can be borne. This issue demands government to be involved and the public must stand up against this public nuisance.

The annoying music played in buses, in the morning, can affect a persons productivity at his or her workplace. If smoking is prohibited in selected areas in public places, the public will oppose if someone smokes. But nobody is interested in taking action against the mental abuse caused by bus drivers or the conductors using loud music. Loud music disturbs the sound mentality of passengers and hinders communication. 
Long distance buses travel while playing extremely loud music. Those playing such music consider it to be an aid that prevents one from falling asleep. Yet they have conveniently forgotten the rights of the passengers. In Sri Lanka the rights of passengers are simply disregarded. Passengers have to simply bear such an inconvenience. In countries like England, its prohibited to play music in buses. In such countries earphones producing too-loud music is treated as a contravene.
This is how other countries are protecting the rights of commuters. It has been proven that words, and how they are pronounced, can influence humans in a good or bad way, said Dr. Dias.
Loud music played in enclosed places can disturb the mentality and hearing of passengers. The comfortable level to play music is around 60-70db. Playing loud music, which is over 80db, can damage hearing. When exposed to very loud music daily for prolonged periods, it can permanently damage hearing. Some passengers insert plugs to their own ears to block messy music. To do this they increase the volume of the music of their choice, which causes more harm in the process. 
Dr. Yasawardane suggested measuring the level of volume using apps to figure out whether the levels are just right or exceed healthy limits. He also reminded people that ones capacity to hear can be tested by undergoing an Audiogram test.

The Presidential Commission of Inquiry (PCoI) said today it would not summon witnesses whose evidence was not necessary because of various opinions expressed by individuals in the media or in other forums.
In a special statement at the start of yesterdays proceedings, PCoI Chairman Justice K.T. Chitrasiri said the Commission had focussed attention to some remarks and reports published in the media, questioning the relevancy of summoning witnesses, who testified recently, on matters that the Commission is required to inquire and some suggestions made by various individuals as to who they preferred should be summoned before the Commission.
It was of the view that it had called only the witnesses, whose evidence was clearly relevant and necessary to the inquiry.
We wish to emphasize that this Commission of Inquiry is governed by the mandate issued to us. We cannot go outside it, the PCoI said. (Shehan Chamika Silva)
