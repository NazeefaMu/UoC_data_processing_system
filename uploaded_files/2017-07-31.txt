Aloysius doesn?t remember password
	
President?s Counsel Anuja Premaratne, appearing for Arjun Aloysius today informed the PCoI that according to his instructions Mr. Aloysius has forgotten the password of his Apple Account.
PC Premaratne is appearing for Mr. Aloysius in the wake of President's Counsel Kalinga Indatissa?s withdrawal.
PC Premaratne sought PCoI?s indulgence to get back the Mr. Aloysius' SIM card handed over to the CID or to obtain a SIM card with the same number from the mobile service provider. He was of the view that his client was in need of his SIM card considering the difficulty he has in conducting his business matters.
However, Additional Solicitor General Yasantha Kodagoda objecting to the request said Mr. Aloysius had not supported the investigation so far by providing his apple account and the password.
?Forgetting the password cannot be accepted because the investigations had revealed that he had used his account for the i-store to download applications, and the new version of the IOS had been updated on his phone which cannot be done without the password, so forgetting it is an absurd excuse,? the ASG said.
He said Mr. Aloysius had lied and it will be proved at the appropriate time and hinted that the investigators were carrying out other methods to locate the password.
The ASG said all the devices could be returned within 48 hours if Mr. Aloysius divulged his password, or else the investigators would need time to do locate the password and Mr. Aloysius would have to be patient it was found. (Shehan Chamika Silva)

Australia foils ?terror plot? to bring down airplane
	
?
Australia has foiled an Islamist-inspired ?terrorist plot? to bring down an airplane with an improvised explosive, authorities said Sunday, after four people were arrested in raids across Sydney. ??
Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said the plot appeared to be ?elaborate? rather than planned by a lone wolf, as security was beefed up at major domestic and international airports across the nation. ??
??I can report that last night there has been a major joint counter-terrorism operation to disrupt a terrorist plot to bring down an airplane,? Turnbull told reporters. Authorities believed they planned to smuggle the device onto a plane to blow it up, the ABC added. ??
Four men were arrested Saturday after armed police stormed homes in at least four neighbourhoods. Names and ages of suspects have not been released and they have not been charged by police. ??
The Seven Network reported 40 riot squad officers moved on a terraced house in the inner city suburb of Surry Hills, as TV footage showed a man with a bandage on his head being led away by authorities, draped in a blanket. ? Sections of surrounding roads remained cordoned off on Sunday as forensic officers and investigators wrapped up and removed items from the house. ??
Airline passengers have meanwhile been asked to arrive at least two hours early for domestic flights and three hours for international routes, and to limit their baggage. ??
Turnbull said the national terror alert level, which was raised in September 2014 would?
remain probable.?

## Title: Dudley and Ranil share rare honour

Dudley and Ranil share rare honour
	
	Of being Prime Minister of the country four times
	
	
	Men of honour to their grand old party, the UNP
	
?
It is few who have had the rare privilege of being Prime Minister of any country four times. In this beautiful land of ours, blessed with the timeless beauty of nature?s magnitude, it is just two people who have achieved this honour.? ?
Therefore it was fitting that one of them, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, gave the 17th annual oration this year in honour of the late Dudley Senanayake, who was the other, several decades ago. Temple Trees was home to both of them, at one time or another and this being the venue this year, made it yet another cherished event, leaving their footprints once again, in the sands of time of our country?s history.?
There has been an erosion of standards in many spheres of life including politics today. Both the late Dudley and Prime Minister Ranil stand out as men of honour, beacons of loyalty to their grand old party, the UNP. Even when Dudley withdrew from politics for a while, he never jumped a political fence to join another party, although invited to do so. Ranil Wickremesinghe too, despite the ups and downs which are invariably a part of a politicians life, has stayed loyal to his party through thick and thin. Both of them suffered countless insults, but took them in their stride, not deviating from their straight political walk. Both are known for their unwavering belief in a school of thought that transcends ethnicity, religion, race, language, class, caste, upcountry- low country divisions which have divided our country and hindered our progress. ??
?
"Ranil entered Parliament in 1977, when the UNP won a landslide victory and was the youngest Minister in the then Cabinet"
?
Dudley was a liberal democrat at heart, Ranil?s thinking too, is inclined in that direction. Both are respected for their respect for others, common sense, simplicity, integrity and belief in the rule of law and democracy. They also share a natural shyness, both lived in the homes their parents built, never made millions, never built vast luxurious mansions or squandered public funds to boost their images, preferring a simple lifestyle, unimpressed by the grandeur and pomp of power.? ?
As Prime Minister Ranil mentioned in his oration, the world and politics have changed immeasurably, since Dudley?s time. He recalled that as a child and a student, he had been fortunate to meet and learn from our past Leaders, who were frequent visitors to his parental home. The late Dudley and J.R. being among them. He also had the privilege of attending debates in Parliament in the sixties,listening to those parliamentarians who were experts at wit and humour. They were in a class of their own in the style and language of debate. He also recalled that the late Dudley had been against the Presidential system. He recalled how Dudley led the party from outside Parliament, when he returned to politics at the invitation of UNP stalwarts in 1958 as he hadn?t contested at the 1956 election. He and the late President J.R. Jayewardene who had lost his seat led the struggle from outside, and there were countless protests, fighting for the freedom of the press and other issues affecting the masses. The late Dudley led the party to victory in 1965, and was Prime Minister till 1970. He spoke of the open economy which was President Jayewardene?s brainchild, begun after Dudley?s time and the political thinking that prevailed during that period.? ?
?
Our country can be proud of both these leaders, Dudley Senanayake and Ranil Wickremesinghe. I believe these words of Gilbert Holland written in the late 19th century epitomize them both
?Ranil entered Parliament in 1977, when the UNP won a landslide victory and was the youngest Minister in the then Cabinet. At the oration, Prime Minister Ranil spoke without a note, taking us back down memory lane, right through Sri Lanka?s political journey. I was amazed as all listeners were, at his elephantine memory and his vast reservoir of knowledge. The late Dudley?s secretary, Joe Karunaratne told me that the oration was one of the best he had heard and I commented that this was because of the vast experience Ranil had and the knowledge he had gained through his forty years in politics. He spoke of the absolute power of the executive Presidency which had been abused in unprecedented fashion by the Rajapaksa government. The country fell into deep debt as a result of misrule, extravagance and the use of State funds to enhance personal glory. The debt which the country has to repay has exceeded Rs 4 trillion. The Chief Justice was removed without going through an impeachment process, without a resolution brought in Parliament to do so. Field Marshall Sarath Fonseka was thrown into jail and treated like a criminal, after his courageous service to the country which enabled us to win the war. Today, it is obvious that people want a change in the Constitution, some have even suggested a return to the Soulbury Constitution, he said they are looking at many options and systems which have been adopted in other parts of the world like the US, New Zealand and other countries. The UNP has accepted and is committed to democratic socialism as the style of government they believe in.? ?
?Our country can be proud of both these leaders, Dudley Senanayake and Ranil Wickremesinghe. I believe these words of Gilbert Holland written in the late 19th century epitomize them both. We need more of this calibre as future leaders.? ?
?
?A time like this demands strong minds, true faith and ready hands!? ?
Men whom the lust of office does not kill,? ?
Men whom the spoils of office cannot buy,? ?
Men who possess opinions and a will,? ?
Men who love honour, men who cannot lie.??

Gemunu complains to Bribery Commission over NTC
	
Lanka Private Bus Owners? Association (LPBOA) lodge a complaint to the Bribery Commission a short while ago over the National Transport Commission (NTC) and Transport Minister Nimal Siripala De Silva on the irregularities taken place when issuing the southern expressway route permits.
LPBOA President Gemunu Wijeratne alleged that the NTC has called off the southern expressway route permit tender and had awarded the temporary permits to the same bus owners without any transparency.
He said already the Presidential Commission of Inquiry (PCoI) and the Bribery Commission conducting two separate investigations over the matter.
He also said the tender was withdrawn on two occasions on August 6, 2016 and July 14 this year.
?A route permit for the expressway is issued for five years. NTC is getting Rs. 750,000 per permit annually. We have requested the permit for a greater price. Therefore government has incurred a loss of Rs 20 million as revenue because of ignoring the tender procedures,? he said. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

?
Lankaputhra Development Bank has come forward to provide loan facilities to entrepreneurs who are already engaged in the orchid industry and who intend to grow orchid. ?

The allies of the national unity government should concentrate on the country's development instead of turning on one another, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said yesterday.
He made such remarks during a religious ceremony held at Kande Vihare in Aluthgama. ?There is no point in confrontational politics at the moment as what is needed at present is for everyone to focus on development" he said.
He said the Hambantota Port deal will bring many benefits to Sri Lanka. He said it would help reducing debt. "A total of Rs 47 billion was spent on the Hambantota Port. These funds could have been used to provide better health and education services to the people instead. It would have been possible to increase the allocation for education by 60 per cent if the country did not fall into debt as a result of the Hambantota Port project" he said.
The premier added that Sri Lanka would get annual revenue of Rs.1.1 billion as a result of the Hambantota Port agreement being signed. He said all the major towns would see massive development taking place in the coming years.(Yohan Perera)

President Maithripala Sirisena today said everybody should keep in their minds that his blessing is essential to form a new government though some groups are dreaming of changing the numbers in Parliament and capture power to form a government.
Commenting on a statement by an opposition parliamentarian as well as a former minister who said the power of the government and the Presidency will be over after winning the support of 113 members in Parliament, the President pointed out that according to the Constitution, nobody can form a new government without his blessing.
He stated when the current government is forwarding its activities by removing all barriers, some empty vociferous people are trying to make disturbances.
The President was speaking at the occasion to open the new building of the Regional Education Office in Hingurakgoda today.
?Some media today have given space not for the people who work with a true feeling about the country, but for the empty vociferous people. Therefore, some people in the country have been given a misunderstanding about the government?, the President said.
?Some people raise these useless voices as they cannot bear the program of the current government carried out through protecting of the freedom and the democracy in the country by changing the way of the country which had been forwarding through fraud, corruption, waste and the family based authority, under my leadership as a leader who raised from the village?, he said.

Pan Asia Bank bottom line narrows 12% during June quarter
	
The mid-sized bank, Pan Asia Banking Corporation PLC, has reported a decline in its profits for the April-June quarter amid higher cost of funds and poor asset quality in a higher?
interest rate environment.?
According to the interim financial accounts filed with the Colombo bourse, the bank, with an asset base of about Rs.130 billion, reported earnings of Rs.2.51 a share or Rs.263.5 million for the quarter under review, down 12 percent year-on-year (YoY).
The financials showed that the core-banking operations had suffered a blow from the higher interest rates as the net interest income edged down by 3.0 percent YoY.
The bank had a net interest income of Rs.1.17 billion for the period as the interest expense rose by as much as 29 percent YoY, while the interest income rose by only 17 percent YoY during the same period.?
The margins came under pressure as the net interest margin fell by 14 basis points to 3.73 percent YoY.?
The most notable was the increase in bad loans as the non-performing loans ratio jumped to 6.26 percent from 4.74 percent in December 2016. The bank has been consistently bringing down its non-performing loan ratio during the last three years but the June quarter marks?
a reversal. ?
This could be attributed to the increase in sour loans amid some lackluster growth in the loans and receivables.?
The loans and receivables grew by not more than Rs.1.8 billion during the six months to June 30, 2017, despite Pan Asia Bank?s competitors were seen growing their loans faster.?
The bank had a gross loans and receivables book of Rs.102.9 billion by June?
30, 2017.?
Meanwhile, the deposits grew by Rs.6.6. billion to Rs.98.1 billion, largely from the medium-term deposits as the low-cost deposit portfolio saw its size diminishing further.?
Lower current and savings accounts (CASA) appears to be also an issue for the bank in fighting the higher cost of funds, which has been pinching its margins.?
The bank in March 2017 raised a little over Rs.2.0 billion via a rights issue to stay in line with the Central Bank?s interim minimum capital requirements.
With the rights issue proceeds, the bank is now well compliance with the BASEL III minimum capital rules but fresh capital would be required going forward to fund growth in the medium term.?
Meanwhile, for the six months ended June 30, 2017, the bank reported earnings of Rs.2.96 a share or Rs.616.8 million, up 2.0 percent from a year earlier.?
?
Prasanna appointed as new Chairman?

His appointment comes in the wake of the retirement of Eshana De Silva, who functioned in the top post less than a year.

SriLankan crew members avert major incident onboard UL 166
	
Cabin crew members aboard SriLankan flight enroute to Colombo from Kochi? on Sunday had managed to successfully avert a major incident which is believed to have been caused by the ignition of a lithium battery pack or mobile phones in a passenger?s hand luggage, the Airline said today.
Issuing a statement, it said the cabin crew members noticed smoke appearing from an overhead luggage bin.
?The aft cabin crew members rapidly armed themselves with fire extinguishers and opened the bin. Upon finding a bag emitting smoke, they sprayed it with an extinguisher. The crew then removed the bag from the overhead bin and carried it quickly away from the passengers to the aft galley, at which time it began to emit smoke once again at a faster rate. Suspecting a lithium fire, they adopted the lithium fire extinguishing procedure by immersing the bag in a container of water.?The situation was successfully contained and the bag ceased to emit smoke. Upon investigation, the crew found a lithium battery pack and two mobile phones in the bag,? the statement said.
?
The crew had informed air traffic controllers at the BIA and the aircraft was met on arrival by dangerous goods experts, firefighters and other safety related personnel.
?With its prime priority being the safety and well-being of its passengers, SriLankan Airlines provides all its cabin crew with rigorous training in the handling of all types of emergency situations including possible fires on board. Also, the Airline?has been actively involved in global safety measures with regard to spontaneous ignition of Lithium batteries. In October 2016, SriLankan imposed a total ban on the carriage and usage of ?Samsung Note 7? on board its aircraft,? the statement further said.
?
SriLankan Airlines, which launched an investigation into the incident, commended the crew for their vigilance, timely action and calmness under pressure in adopting the proper procedures, which avoided a major incident.

## Title: The story of the Sacred Tooth Relic

The story of the Sacred Tooth Relic
	
?
The world?s greatest pageant where animals and humans mingle without any untoward incidents is the Kandy Esala Perahera which paraded the streets this year on July 29, 2017 (Saturday) at the auspicious time of 6.58 pm with the rituals enacted within the inner shrine room or ? Wadiahiristanaye ?? ?
The first night was more eventful especially for the infants, pregnant mothers and children below five years. They come to witness this wonderful pageant, on the very first night, which is the ?Kumbal? Perahera.? ?
According to the Diyawadana Nilame Pradeep Nilanga Dela, around ninety elephants, including Tuskers are lined up for the event.
The Temple is associated with formal rites and rituals throughout the year and the climax, the Annual Perahera, which is combined with the beliefs and the mystique of the Sacred Tooth Relic.
The story of the Sacred Relic enshrined within the Sri Dalada Maligawa is deeply entrenched in the system. The lives of the people are dominated by this singular Relic, which has made its way over the waves by the miraculous powers that it possess. There is a spiritual adventure behind this Sacred Relic. Why should such a mass of people come to witness this Perahera and also seek the blessings of the ritual enacted with the Perahera or procession of men and animals.? ?
If one has to say the adventure of the Sacred Relic, then it has to be said. The story begins from ancient India, where the Buddha was born, to be exact in the Botanical Gardens of Lumbini, present Nepal .? ?
The Buddha, after his demise was cremated at Kusinara in the ?sal? flower garden of the Kings of Mallawa. There would have been a mass scale war if the distribution of the relics which fell out of the cremation pyre was not solved equitably, Budda?s four Sacred teeth, Sacred Jaw and the Sacred forehead remained in the ashes.? ?
The clan of Dambadiva Mallawa Kings arrived in Kusinara with their armed forces and demanded the relics. They were even ready to wage a war against any King who resisted of obtaining the Relics they needed.?
?
"The lives of the people are dominated by this singular Relic, which has made its way over the waves by the miraculous powers that it possess."
?
?
A Bramin known as Drona mediated among the Kings and brought about a settlement when the Kings who were present with their armed forces agreed in the settlement suggested by Bramin Drona. The Bramin Drona used a measurement that was prevalent at that time known as ?Neeliya?. The kings agreed on this measurement and commenced the division.? ?
During the process Bramin Drona took one of the Sacred Teeth and hid it in his turban as it is said that the mightiest of the mighty - God Sakara - from his heavenly seat of divine powers saw the greed of Bramin Drona and he in turn took away the Tooth Relic and enshrined the Sacred object in his heavenly paradise.? ?
An Arahat by the name ?Bem? obtained a Sacred Relic also from the cremation pyre. He placed the Sacred Relic in the custody of King of Kalinga One to the cult of snakes and one to the city of Ghandara. To make matters short, King Gunaseeva from Kalinga (present day Orissa) eventually inherited the Sacred Tooth Relic which is now deposited in Kandy, which is acknowledged to be the Sacred Tooth Relic obtained by Arahat Bem.? ?
King Gunaseeva was under the suzerainity of King Pandu and having observed that King Gunaseeva was engaged in a heathen worship, tried to destroy the Sacred Relics by various means. Having been unsuccessful King Pandu gave away the relic to King Gunaseeva to worship the way he wishes.? ?
The Minister in charge of the daily devotions to the Sacred Tooth Relic was Prince Danta. King Gunaseeva gave his daughter Hemmali in marriage to Prince Danta. As time went on, he found that there was to be a war with other Princes and he knew that he would resist his aggression as many were involved. All this was to gain control of the Sacred Relic.? The first thing he did was to safeguard the Sacred Tooth Relic, he called his daughter and Son-in-law Danta and bade them to take away the relic to Sri Lanka, which he considered the only place safe for the Relic.? ?
?
Ehelepola Nilame tried to imitate in one Perahera as the King, but the British made short rift of this adventure, fearing that people would be with him
King Gunaseeva first made a receptacle of pure Gold for the Sacred Tooth Relic which was in the shape of a ?Corn- Cob?. The gold receptacle was studded with red rubies. The top of this receptacle was round in shape and when stuck on the hair knot of Princess Hemmali, it looks like another piece of jewellery.? ?
So disguised in this manner, Prince Danta and Princess Hemmali travelled to Sri Lanka during the reign of ninth year of King Megavanna. This was in 371 AD. The early history of the Relic is depicted in a classic ? Dalada Sirita ? by Devaraj - the Miniser of Religious Affairs during the reign of King Parakamabahu IV ( 1302-1346).? ?
In the chequered history of the relic, it had travelled right through the country, the one ambition by all who held it was that it should not fall into the hands of an enemy.? ?
The original Corn-Cob receptacle is still in the Sacred Temple of the Tooth in Kandy in the last casket of the seven caskets, where key of the casket is held by the Mahanayake of Asgiri, whoever comes to office. There is no change and the red rubies like the corn seeds are still intack seen by the writer during the custodianship of the former Diyawadana Nilame Neeranjan Wijeyratne.? ?
The Sacred Tooth Relic was once taken out of the Sri Dalda Maligawa in 1828, with the assistance of the British Governor and after the famous rebellion the Sacred Relic never left the Sri Dalada Maligawa. ??
The British cared for it and even placed an Army Guard over the Sri Dalda Malgiawa and the keys of the Maligawa were in the hands of the Government Agent, Sir John D?Olyly.? ?
In ancient days it was the Maha Sangha who paraded behind the Tusker when the Sacred Tooth Relic was taken in procession. There was no Diyawadana Nilame to go behind, while the King rode a white steed behind the Maha Sangha.? ?
Presently, the Kandy Esala Perahera carries the Golden Perahera Karanduwa on the Tusker - last Satruday night Indiraja carried the Golden Karanduwa (Gift of the Prime Minister of India at that time) Now the Sacred Relic is NOT taken in the Perahera any more. ??
Ehelepola Nilame tried to imitate in one Perahera as the King, but the British made short rift of this adventure, fearing that people would be with him.? ?
So this is a shortest story of the Sacred Tooth Relic and which is NOT being carried in the Kandy Esala Perahera any more.?

Trump: Won?t let China ?do nothing? on N. Korea
	
?
WASHINGTON AFP July30, 2017 ?- US President Donald Trump warned Saturday that he would not allow China to ?do nothing? on North Korea, after the hermit state launched an intercontinental ballistic missile it boasted could reach the United States. ??
North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un boasted of his country?s ability to strike any target in the US after the ICBM test that weapons experts said could even bring New York into range --in a major challenge to Trump. ??
In his critique of Beijing, which came in two tweets, Trump linked trade strains with the Asian giant --marked by a trade deficit of $309 billion last year-- to policy on North Korea, after South Korea indicated it was speeding the deployment of a US missile defence system that has infuriated China. ??
??I am very disappointed in China. Our foolish past leaders have allowed them to make hundreds of billions of dollars a year in trade, yet they do nothing for us with North Korea, just talk,? Trump wrote. ??
??We will no longer allow this to continue. China could easily solve this problem!? Trump, who is at loggerheads with Beijing over how to handle Kim?s regime, has repeatedly urged China to rein in its recalcitrant neighbour, but Beijing insists dialogue is the only practical way forward. ??
The tweet storm coincided with a bilateral mission led by US strategic bombers on Saturday that flew over the Korean Peninsula in a pointed show of force in response to the latest ICBM tests. ?

UNP keen on Unity Govt. to solve national issues: Kabir
	
Public Enterprises Development Minister Kabir Hashim said today the United National Party (UNP) had no issues in securing parliamentary majority but their aim was to continue to function as a Unity Government to find solutions to national issues faced by Sri Lanka.
?The UNP would have had an advantage if it formed a UNP government. But we believed that the best way to resolve national issues was through a unity government concept,? he said.
When asked by journalists whether the UNP hoped to join the TNA to form a government if some SLFP members quit the government as claimed, the minister said there was no reason to do so because UNP had no issues with regard to securing a parliamentary majority.
?What is important is to protect the national government concept. We can engage in party politics after 2020. We promised to resolve issues faced by this country. We must do that first,? he said. (Ajith Siriwardana)
