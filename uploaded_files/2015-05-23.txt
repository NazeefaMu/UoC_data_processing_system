Video: Bonds worth Rs.2.7 trillion sold during previous regime - PM
	
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said yesterday Treasury Bonds worth a staggering Rs.2.7 trillion had been sold by the Central Bank to an accomplice of the previous regime by violating standard tender procedure in 2012, 2013 and 2014.
He said the committee appointed by him to inquire into the controversial sale of Treasury Bonds during tenure of Central Bank Governor Arjuna Mahendran had come across these startling facts.
?The February Central Bank sale was only about Rs.10 billion and the decision on the sale had taken by the Tender Committee. Its decision had been later approved by Governor Mahendran. However, Treasury Bonds worth Rs. 2.7 trillion had been sold from 2012 to 2014 violating CB policies,? he said addressing the United National Party (UNP) activists at Sirikotha.? ?
He said February?s Bond sale had been carried out in a transparent manner at a public auction but said in previous years there had been no public auction and this had discouraged primary dealers of the Central Bank.
?
The Prime Minister said? Rs.2,437 billion worth Bonds had been sold after calling for tenders but the then CB Governor had been directly involved in the Tender Committee in violation of the standard procedure.
?The Governor cannot take action on behalf of the Tender Committee but that was what happened during tenure of the previous CB governor. The Committee had not been informed of the decisions of the then Governor. It is also not clear who purchased these bonds. Although the previous government had favoured its sycopants it failed to grant any relief to the ordinary people or pay them a living wage,? he said.
The PM said the Opposition was uncomfortable with the full report of the Committee being published because of the fear that the acts of blatant fraud and corruption during the previous regime would be revealed in the process.? ?
?The Opposition wants to cover up their acts of corruption by focusing only on Mr. Mahendran, whose name had been cleared by the Supreme Court. However, we agree with the Speaker?s decision to refer the committee report to COPE and to await its response,? he said.(Lahiru Pothmulla)WATCH

<U+200B>Lankan driver jailed over jogger death in UK
	
An "extremely tired" van driver who hit and killed a jogger near Epsom after working a 12-hour night shift has been jailed for four years, in the United Kingdom.
When his vehicle fatally struck Louisa Gammie in Worcester Park on a morning last November, 34-year-old Shamugarasa Vinayagasivampillai had only slept for only around four hours, having just worked a 12-hour night shift for the previous seven days.
Vinayagasivampillai was sentenced at Guildford Crown Court on Friday having previously pleaded guilty to causing death by dangerous driving.
He was behind the wheel of a Nissan Primastar van in Old Malden Lane on Saturday November 8 2014 when he veered across the road, missed the oncoming traffic, but hit Ms Gammie.
The 39-year-old sadly died in hospital the next day.
The court heard that the defendant, of Meadway in Surbiton, held down two jobs - a 12-hour night shift for seven days a week, plus an afternoon job four days a week.
He had worked both before the tragic incident and had just run an errand for his uncle when he struck Ms Gammie, who was running along the verge.
Prosecutor Rossano Scamardella said: "Police officers at the scene noted that, notwithstanding what had just happened, the defendant kept falling asleep.
"He could not remember what had caused the collision. The first thing he knew he heard a bang and saw people getting out of their cars in his mirror."
Mr Scamardella told the court the defendant had previous convictions for drink driving and driving without insurance from 2012.
Defence counsel Nicholas Barraclough said his client had been financially responsible for his mother in Sri Lanka, from where he had come as a refugee in 2000, as well as his two sisters, who's weddings and dowries he had recently funded shortly before the accident.
"Nothing can be said at this stage on his behalf to make this tragedy any better for the family," he said.
"All he can do through me is humbly and sincerely apologise for his actions."
Sentencing the defendant, Judge Christopher Critchlow said: "You have brought a tragedy to the family who sit in this court as a result of your driving when you were plainly too tired.
"You should not have been anywhere near a motorcar.
"Nothing I can say can bring back to her family a talented woman: an HR adviser; a young mother and partner. It was an awful day for that family which they will never forget."
Judge Critchlow also disqualified the defendant from driving for six years.
Following the sentencing, Detective Sergeant Gary Wright said: "This was a tragic incident which resulted in a woman losing her life, and our thoughts and sympathies remain with her family and friends.
"Shamugarasa Vinayagasivampillai's reckless actions by getting behind the wheel that morning when he was extremely tired had catastrophic consequences, which Louisa Gammie's family will have to live with for the rest of their lives."
And in a clear warning to other motorists, DS Wright added: "If you know you are tired, the answer is simple ? do not drive.?(getsurrey)

The order was issued to Janatha Balaya Organisation, Jaffna Women?s organization and Northern Provincial Councillor Anandi Shashidharan.
Around 130 suspects were remanded on charges of unlawful assembly and stoning the Jaffna Courts Complex on Thursday.
