Alarmed by Australia separating SL family: UNHCR
	
The UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, today said it is alarmed by a separation of a Sri Lankan refugee family in Sydney by the Government of Australia.
In a statement it said the deportation overnight of the Sri Lankan father leaves his Sri Lankan partner, who is a recognized refugee, alone in Australia with their 11-month-old daughter.
This contravenes the basic right of family unity, as well as the fundamental principle of the best interests of the child. UNHCR sought assurances from the Australian Government that the man would not be removed from Australia and be allowed to remain with his family.
Private legal representatives had also lodged multiple requests for intervention with the Home Affairs Minister. We regret that those collective representations were unsuccessful, it said.
Australias current policy of offshore processing and deterrence has led to the ongoing separation of refugee families since 2013.
Asylum-seekers who arrive to Australia by sea have been prevented from reuniting with their loved ones in Australia, including spouses, parents and children.
UNHCR is aware of several other parents currently held under Australian offshore processing in Nauru, whose spouses were transferred to Australia for medical reasons, including in order to give birth.
The Government of Australia has refused to allow them to be reunited in Australia, despite the fact that neither Nauru nor Papua New Guinea are considered suitable places of settlement for the vast majority of refugees.
In more than one instance, children have also remained in Nauru separated from an adult parent sent to Australia for medical care. This has had a particularly devastating effect on their deteriorating mental health.
This latest incident goes beyond a refusal to reunite families, to instead actively and indefinitely separate them. Current legislation prevents the Sri Lankan mother in this case from ever sponsoring her spouse to join her and their child in Australia.
The husband and father is likewise prevented from ever obtaining even a short-term visa to visit his family. Sadly, the family members expect to be kept apart indefinitely.
The UNHCR urged Australia to uphold the fundamental principle of family unity, and allow family members to be together.

Britain in secret talks to evict Julian Assange
	

UK (Daily Mail), 15 July 2018 - Britain is in secret talks with Ecuador to evict Wikileaks founder Julian Assange from its embassy in London.
Senior foreign officials, believed to include the Foreign Office minister Sir Alan Duncan, are in talks to try and decide Mr Assanges future.
He has been living at the embassy in Knightsbridge, in London, since June 2012.
The top-level discussions come just weeks before a UK visit by new Ecuador President Lenin Moreno who has previously called Assange a hacker and a stone in the shoe, according to The Sunday Times.
In a recent visit to Ecuador in late-June US Vice President Mike Pence raised the issue of the Australian anti-secrecy activist.
Foreign Minister Jose Valencia said: Ecuador and the United Kingdom, and of course Mr Assange as a person who is currently staying, on asylum, at our embassy

Britains Conservative Party in turmoil
	
UK, (Daily Mail), 15 July 2018 - The Labour Party today hinted that they could back a second EU referendum - as the Conservative party Brexit civil war threatened to tear the party apart.
Labour deputy leader Tom Watson said that a second vote cannot be taken off the table completely.
The hints come as the Tory Brexit civil war continues to rage as with mutinous Brexiteers warning the PM she must ditch her Chequers plan to risk being ousted as leader. 
London Mayor Sadiq Khan -Labours most senior elected politician- told the BBCs Andrew Marr Show: If our Parliament rejects the deal the Prime Minister makes with the European Union this autumn, there are two options. 
One is a General Election. The second option is a referendum for people to have a say on what the government has done in relation to deal with the European Union. 
Im not sure what other options the Government have.

Building Brains, Building Futures
	
Minister of Finance accepts proposals to increase funding in early childhood development for 2019 National Budget at the Building Brains Building Futures High Level Meeting on 16th July in Colombo organized by the Department of National Planning and supported by UNICEF.

In a landmark event, marking Policy Makers Day of National Early Childhood Care Week 2018, Building Brains, Building Futures, The Sri Lanka Early Childhood Development (ECD) High-Level Meeting presented early childhood-centric budget proposals to Minister Mangala Samaraweera, Minister of Finance for his consideration in the 2019 National Budget.
Investing in health, nutrition, education and protection from birth through to age five  known as Early Childhood Development  enables all children to reach their full brain capacity, and is one of the most effective and proven drivers of sustainable economic growth.
Budget proposals focussed on Health and Nutrition, Protection and Early Childhood Education were presented by the Ministries of Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine, Women and Child Affairs and Education, to the Minister of Finance and Mass Media for his consideration in the National Budget for 2019.
For Sri Lanka, the cost of not investing in critical interventions that ensure a childs full brain development could be substantial including a generation with poorer health, fewer learning skills and even a reduced earning capacity resulting in a weaker economy with a greater burden on social welfare systems.
Speaking at the event, UNICEF Representative for Sri Lanka Tim Sutton said The proposals presented today have the power to transform the lives of children and drive Sri Lankas economic growth. Evidence shows that this investment is one of the most cost-effective ways to build this countrys human capital, with a return on investment of as much as 13.7 per cent. We urge the Government of Sri Lanka and the Members of Parliament to support this call for national budget investment in early childhood, to ensure that every child in the country reaches their full potential.

Government Ministries and UNICEF join forces to secure increased national budget investment in Early Childhood Development from the Minister of Finance and Mass Media
The event was attended by Prof. Edward Melhuish - Professor of Human Development, University of Oxford and UNICEF Regional Director for South Asia Jean Gough among other parliamentarians, ministry officials and members of the diplomatic corps.
The High-Level Meeting, was organized by the Department of National Planning and supported by the United Nations Childrens Fund (UNICEF) in partnership with the Ministry of Finance and Mass Media, Ministry of National Policies and Economic Affairs, Ministry of Education, Ministry of Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine, Ministry of Women and Child Affairs, The Parliamentary Caucus for Children and World Bank.

Church of Ceylon says no to death penalty
	
The Church of Ceylon (Anglican Church) on Monday said it was against the death penalty and instead called on the government to vigorously combat drug smuggling and distribution at all levels in the society.
Issuing a statement, the Church of Ceylon said it cannot in any way agree with the move to resume the execution of those sentenced to death for drug related crimes and are yet continuing to be involved in the drug trade while in prison.
As Christians, we believe that all people are made in the image of God and are therefore imbued with the spark of the divine within them, however obscured and hidden it may be. This is why the taking of human life is expressly condemned by the Church, whether by man or by the State. We believe the move has been rushed into without proper reflection in the backdrop of criticism and public disquiet about the spate of gang related murders and shootings in the recent days, it said.
The statement said the engagement in criminal activities outside prison by convicted persons cannot take place without the connivance of prison authorities.
The government cannot absolve itself from its duty to devise ways of minimizing such occurrences. It must take quick but well designed steps to put into place strong security measures in prisons. Obtaining the services of experts here and even abroad, if required. It cannot resort to hanging people to escape its own obligations, it said.
The Church said their opposition to death penalty does not mean that it is unconcerned about the drug menace.
We are indeed very deeply concerned by this widespread and very dangerous threat especially to the young people of our country and its consequences on wider society. We encourage our clergy and organizations to carry out awareness programmes and join with others in doing whatever we can to protect children. The church is willing to join and offer our assistance to the government in this regard in the educational sector, it said.
It is widely spoken including in government circles, that it is the sprats who are being caught and punished while the sharks are allowed to remain free to carry on their business, profitable to many, even politicians it is said. The law ought and must be applied in full force equally to all involved in this destructive trade, the Church of Ceylon said.

Death sentence: Woman tops the list
	
Justice and Prison Reforms Minister Thalata Athukorala said yesterday that a woman prisoner headed the list of the death row criminals, submitted to be hanged.
At an event held in Kahawatta, the Minister said the country had already become a drug trafficking hub when they came into power.
Some officers, prison officials and police officers are involved in drug trafficking. We are taking every action to curb this menace in the country she said.
Meanwhile, the Justice and Prison Reforms Ministry said yesterday that although the list of convicted drug traffickers who were sentenced to death was submitted to the ministry, a comprehensive report was being prepared to be handed over to the President.
A spokesman for the ministry said that the President had asked for a report from the ministry and not from the Prisons Commissioner.
It is not a simple task to complete such a report within a day or two. The ministry needs to look into every possible angle to make it right. There are some foreign convicts who have been sentenced to death over drug-related crimes and some convicts have several court cases. If we sentence a wrong person to death it would lead to chaos, he said.
It was reported that a list consisting of the names of 18 convicts, who were sentenced to death for drug-related crimes, had been submitted to the Justice and Prison Reforms Ministry by the Prison Commissioner. (Darshana Sanjeewa)

Eternal link  between chemicals,  Food and  disease
	
Since Sikkim became the first organic paddy farming state in India in 2015, many other countries have shown interest in working towards establishing a safe andorganic food industry.
Senior Professor and Chairman of the Department of Food Science & Technology at the University of Sri Jayawardenepura, K.K.D.S Ranaweera, explained how people can avoid diseases like cancer by consuming organic food. The professor also explained why people should change the present system and adopt the old system of farming and food consumption. 

The Gene Structure of humans who lived 10,000 years ago was different compared to the modern humans. The majority of the food they consumed were of plant origin and not artificial like today. Maybe the food we consume today is incompatible with our genes and it is causing non-communicable diseases. 
Those people lived before the boom in the pharmaceutical industry and controlled diseases with the food and the medicines found in the wild. They didnt consume higher levels of sugar or anything artificial. Their drinking water was not contaminated with harmful chemicals and they didnt have diseases such as Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD).  Professor Ranaweera said. 
How are cancer cells formed


The human life starts with one cell dividing and multiplying into trillions of cells which are then coordinated. There are about 80-100 trillion cells in the human body. The coordination keeps the cells well tuned into do what is expected. 
This coordination is broken sometimes when the cells lose control and become abnormal. Genes sometimes change themselves in a way that could develop cancer cells. Cancer cells have an advanced defensive mechanism when compared to healthy cells in our body. They can move anywhere. They grow without control in blood cells and lymphatic cells. 
Cancer cells make a lump or a cluster of cells, grow and spread. This is how cancer cells grow except for Leukemia cells. There are more than 100 types of cancer. Abnormal genes inside a cell are the cause of this abnormality. 
A developing fetus has the best gene combination of father and mother. When the babys genes fail to meet the demands of the environment it is being born to, stillbirths occur as a result of the Natural Selection, which might create a baby with resistance to the Viruses like HIV, in the future. professor Ranaweera noted.  A gene is a sequence (a string) of bases. Its made up of combinations of A, T, C, and G. These unique combinations determine the genes function, much as letters join together to form words. Each person has thousands of genes - billions of base pairs of DNA or bits of information repeated in the nuclei of human cells -which determine individual characteristics (genetic traits), MedicineNet.com says. 
There are friendly as well as unfriendly genes in our body. Friendly genes help us to fight diseases and suppress the bad ones, while some do help the spread of diseases.  Some genes get silenced (by attaching to a part of Methyl or CH3) and loses the ability to help us in fighting diseases. Gene Silencing is resulted by the food and drinks we consume while other factors are stress, food additives, certain medications and drugs. (Medicines are as harmful as pesticides, even though we do not think deeply of the danger of the former.) 
Irradiation (exposure into a radioactive substance), Ultra Violet rays, X rays, Cigarette smoke, a high dose of medicine as well as long-term consumption of medicines, pesticides, chewing betel nut with tobacco, some viruses and most serious Free Radicals make cancer cells except for gene silencing. Professor Ranaweera explained. 
The story of Free Radicals
Unpaired electrons are called free radicals - an atom or atoms with at least one unpaired electron; in the body, it is usually an oxygen molecule that has lost an electron and will stabilize itself by stealing an electron from a nearby electron - (defined by the Vocabulary.com) 
These free radicals are made in our body. They are made naturally. Those are aggressive and try to bond themselves with another electron, regardless of whether it is good or bad.


Then the robbed electron becomes a free radical (because there is only one electron) This robbing and pairing might proceed in a chain, and the entire DNA molecule could be changed, generating a cancer cell. Free radicals display both good and bad traits as well as fighting viruses and bacteria.

Oxidation (exposure to air) can get one electron out of a paired electron other than free radicals. Cigarette smoke might have oxidation compounds, which force one electron out of the bond. Free radicals cause Cancers and Organ damage (Liver -the machine in human). Pesticides and other chemicals are far harmful to the liver than liquor. 
If one electron volunteered to give an electron of its pair, the chain reaction stops. Those volunteers are called antioxidants that are so common in fruits and vegetables.

We can control this dangerous play of free radicals by consuming more fruits and vegetables. It is true, fruits and vegetables can prevent the formation of cancer cells, but from where on the earth comes fruits and vegetables free of chemicals such as pesticides and herbicides he questioned. 

Chemicals and the food chain
It was discovered that artificial chemicals avoid the damage of pests and weeds and improved harvest. The West began to research on food species and introduced their new, but less successful varieties and developed the existing ones. Even then we had developed agricultural practices in Sri Lanka, which were later replaced by the Westerners. 
They acquired and deposited those samples in their Gene Banks in the guise of offering scholarships to countrymen, In the name of International Rice Research. It was easier for them to manipulate us since the islanders always looked down upon themselves. 


New varieties were lower in quality compared to the local ones which had great characteristics of resisting salt and floods. Punctual management, proper caring and more water were needed for the newly introduced ones. However the root system was also weaker and chemicals were mandatory in all paces of cultivation. The commonly used chemicals eventually became hazards not only for pests and to the soil, but also for the farming and consuming human, environment and the wildlife. 
Years passed and the farmers couldnt survive without pesticides, herbicides and fertilizers. Many of them are still unaware of the toxicity of these highly poisonous substances. After knowing of these dangers, some farmers grow vegetables and crops for their own consumption, free of chemicals. Responsible Government officials lack the interest to inform and explain the dangers of these hazards. he pointed out. 

We can control this dangerous play of free radicals by consuming more fruits and vegetables. It is true, fruits and vegetables can prevent the formation of cancer cells
Ignorant farmers
Some farmers make a Cocktail by mixing several pesticides together. They are unaware of the fact that when applying these to vegetations such as Snake Gourd most of the spray falls back on them. It takes time to decompose chemicalsin vegetations.
Therefore farmers are advised to use them at least two weeks before harvesting time, but they use it the day before. They have no understanding of the doze too. 
Using Glyphosate in tea plantations is quite popular in the hills while some paddy farmers use the same substance for their rice harvest, expecting a smooth and separate bran (the outer husks of the grain) and the seed during threshing. Manioc farmers are using it around the bush a few days prior to harvesting so that the entire bush comes out smoothly. 
These are the results of the restricted connection between farmers and the immediate Agrarian officers. Private agrochemical firms take this opportunity to reach farmers, giving sound advice and good chemicals for crops. The remaining gap in these loopholes allow the malpractices and misuse of pesticides and fertilizers. 
Sri Lanka is a paddy farming country inheriting a proud history of successful agriculture, but hasnt yet produced any equipment to test the percentage of pesticides, herbicides or other chemicals present in the crops. 
Sri Lankan farmers are still using banned pesticides secretly. Many of these pesticides dissolve in the fat layer in our body since many pesticides are not water-soluble. Therefore the pesticides we consume could have been stored in our body, in the forms of Vitamin A & D. These substances will produce unhealthy long-term results. Professor Ranaweera noted. 
Fruits and vegetables
The majority of fruits and vegetables we consume are results of the basic needs of plants (Primary Metabolize), such as fruitsand seeds. Some plants have unique characteristics developed to protect themselves from herbivores, to resist drought, salinity and floods, and attract animals etc, - these fall into Secondary Metabolize which are known as Bio-Active Compounds. These are present in spices (Cinnamon), food, antibiotics. 
The bright red colour in Water Melon and Tomatoes is a pigment called Lycopene present in fruits and vegetables in Carotenoid Family. Lycopene is strong enough to fight free radicals, Low-Density Lipoprotein (LDL - bad cholesterol) in blood, and cancers in Pancreas, Colon, Rectum, Esophagus, Breasts, Teeth and even the Cervix. (Lycopene pigment emanate only when the food is cooked or heated up.)  Vegetables in Brassicaceae family including Cabbage, Broccoli, Brussels Sprouts, Chinese Cabbage, Cauliflower, Radish, Mustard and Turnips have a natural component, a bioactive group called Glucosinolates, which protect the body from cancers. Eating those vegetables is like having medicine.
But there will be benefits only if the vegetables are planted naturally, without the use of chemicals.  According to the results of a university research, Purple Cabbage is rich in glucosinolates. Chewing the food will give the best effects. The majority of fruits and vegetables are rich in flavonoids, Isophane, and saponins that may help lower the risk of cancers. 
Small Onions, Green Tea, Red Grapes have a component called Quercetin which helps the DNA methylation in a good way. Genistein present in Soy Bean and Curcumin changes the DNA methylation according to the bodily needs. Vegetables belonging to the Caretonoid family like Pumpkin and Carrot as well as fruits like Mango also possess antioxidants. 

The commonly used chemicals eventually became hazards not only for pests and to the soil, but also for the farming and consuming human
Many farmers and sellers use calcium carbide (highly carcinogenic substance) to forcefully ripen fruits as mango, pineapple, and bananas. Many fertilizers could include heavy metals, which are harmful to human health. 
Nearly all the harmful chemicals are used in leafy green vegetations. Cleaning vegetables and soaking them in moderately warm salt water to remove chemical residue is also important. Vinegar, Baking Soda, and Turmeric water play important roles in removing these chemicals and germs.
These fruits and vegetables help us get rid of diseases like cancer and to take advantage of that we should cultivate our fruits andvegetables organically. 
A proper monitoring system and a value chain must be implemented by the Government. Consumers, farmers, retailers, transporters and all related should not miss this since food safety is a collective responsibility. he concluded.

Executions! Again  
	
Clean up the Prisons Department, for, without the collaboration of Prisons Department officials, these offenders cannot continue their criminal activities
	When the decision was taken many years ago, not to execute those sentenced to death, this decision was based on the fact that nowhere in the world had murders been reduced by punishing those committing such crimes with execution.

There have been mixed reactions to the news that Sri Lanka would again carry out executions of those sentenced to death, in particular situations/circumstances.
Are we serious when we say this
You carried this news on the front page on July 12.
We have not removed this punishment from our Statute Books, but for very good reasons, we have not carried out this punishment now for many years.
We are in that group of civilized nations, which do not take the life of any of its citizens as a punishment.
Are we now considering going back to those days when we took the lives of those sentenced to death
We boast of being a country, where all the major religions of the world are practised. What right do we have to take the life of one of our own citizens, however, grave the crime is
Such action is against the teachings of all our religions. These individuals will ultimately pay for these crimes, in hell or in their next birth, but we have no right to take their lives.
I was very surprised to read in the Daily Mirror on the very next day, on July 13, that the head of the Roman Catholic Church, Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith had welcomed President Sirisenas decision to execute drug dealers who have been sentenced to death and had expressed support to that decision.
The Head of the largest Christian Church in Sri Lanka supporting executions Unbelievable!
There was a report that the President of the Philippines, Rodrigo Duterte, had also commended the decision of President Sirisena to execute drug dealers sentenced to death. I hope our President will not take too much notice of the commendations of the President of the Philippines.
When the decision was taken many years ago, not to execute those sentenced to death, this decision was based on the fact that nowhere in the world had murders been reduced by punishing those committing such crimes with execution.
While some may maintain that such convicts deserve death, there have been instances when innocents have also been executed. Such miscarriage of justice can never be redressed.
These facts were among those that led to the decision not to carry out the death penalty.
The discussion today is largely centred around those sentenced to death for drug offences. The same reasons for not executing those convicted of such offences, I believe still holds.
Will executions reduce these crimes Arent there possibilities of innocents being executed on fabricated evidence
If we take our religions seriously can we carry out executions
We need to clean up the Prisons Department, for, without the collaboration and assistance of senior Prisons Department officials, these convicted drug offenders cannot continue their criminal activities.
Are not the Police responsible for bringing the small fry in this trade to Justice, while the big-time traders, among whom, are indeed many politicians, remain free
Should the Government not put these right.
A major clean up is necessary.

Exhaust emission limits, safety: Vehicle importers to strictly adhere to Gazette notifications
	
The government by two gazette notifications has called on vehicle importers to ensure the permissible vehicular exhaust emission limits of every motor vehicle imported or assembled or manufactured locally are adhered to with effect from last Sunday (15).
The extraordinary gazette notifications were issued by the Ministry of Mahaweli Development and Environment and the Ministry of Development Strategies and International Trade on July 12 and 13 under the National Environmental Act and the Imports and Exports Control Act, respectively.
According to the gazette notifications that were issued, motor vehicles which do not comply with the emission standards and safety measures required will be re-exported at the cost of the importer(s) and it shall be included as a condition in the Letter of Credit (LC), estimation of motor vehicles.
The importing of vehicles which were equipped with safety features such as air-bags, seat belts and specified emission levels or their equivalent as prescribed by Euro IV was to be implemented by from July 1.
However, it was not implemented on that day due to the absence of the relevant Gazette notification, the Ministry said.
The emission standards and safety measures specified should be included in the LC as a mandatory requirement to be complied with during the importation process.
However, these regulations would not be applicable for the importation of motor vehicles based on LCs raised on or before July 12.
In the case of seat belts, the driver and the person in the passenger seat should have the three-point seat belts for use while in the case of passengers in the rear of the vehicle they should have two-point seat belts where applicable. Vehicles should be equipped with standard air-bags while all vehicles should be manufactured with an Anti-lock Braking System (ABS) for safety.
Importation of all motor vehicles other than brand new motor vehicles should carry a pre-shipment certificate with the required standards mentioned and it should only be issued by the authorised inspector. (Chaturanga Samarawickrama)

Forests are vital for you and me
	

Forestry being a vital part in the battle against climate change or global warming, President Maithripala Sirisena in Rome yesterday made the keynote speech at the 24th session of the Committee on Forestry (COFO) and the 6th World Forest Week organized by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO).
The Presidential Media Unit says, the Rome meeting will explore the contribution that forests can make to achieve sustainable development goals.
The Committee will examine what contributions forests can make to achieving the SDGs and other internationally agreed goals. 
It says the Committee will also explore ways to accelerate progress, in particular, towards Goal 15; discuss actions for implementing the policy recommendations of the Committee on World Food Security regarding the contributions of forests to food security and nutrition; review opportunities and challenges for urban and semi-urban forestry; consider the implementation of the FAOs climate change strategy and specific tasks related to forest resilience, health and forest fires and provide strategic direction for the future work of FAO in forestry.
According to the presidential media unit, it is significant that President Sirisena is addressing this conference in an environment where the government has taken policy decisions to increase the forest density of the country from 29% to 32% and in a background where numerous steps have been taken in this regard.
According to the FAO yesterdays session will provide vital opportunities to strengthen policy and programme coordination and to contribute to greater synergies at the organizational level. The session is intended to carry forests and theSustainable Development Goals from aspiration to action.
The presidential media unit says, the government has launched a project to motivate school children to plant at least one tree in home gardens, school premises or wherever possible to encourage and to make children aware of their duty to conserve and preserve nature. 
This comes in the aftermath of an FAO warning on July 6 that time is running out for the worlds forests, whose total area is shrinking by the day. In a report the FAO urges governments to foster an all-inclusive approach to benefit both trees and those who rely on them.
Halting deforestation, managing forests sustainably, restoring degraded forests and adding to worldwide tree cover all require actions to avoid potentially damaging consequences for the planet and its people, according to the FAOs the state of the worlds forests for this year.
Forests and trees contribute far more to human livelihoods than is commonly known, playing crucial roles in food security, drinking water, renewable energy and rural economies. They provide around 20 percent of income for rural households in developing countries - notably more in many areas - and fuel for cooking and heating for one in every three people around the world.
Forests are critical to livelihoods said FAO Director-General Jos Graziano da Silva. Healthy and productive forests are essential to sustainable agriculture and we have proof of the significance of forests and trees for the quality of water, for contributing to the energy needs of the future, and for designing sustainable, healthy cities.
This years report documents just how essential forests are for 2030 agenda objectives ranging from tackling climate change to conserving biodiversity, reducing inequalities and improving urban habitats. It offers concrete proof of the multiple contributions forests make and maps pathways for them to do more.
Trees and forests contribute to achieving multiple targets across the 2030 agenda and need to be incorporated into strategies to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals, said FAO Forestry Director Eva Mueller.
The report emphasizes the importance of clear legal frameworks regarding forest tenure rights, applauds the growing trend in local governance, and calls for effective partnerships and private sector engagement to pursue sustainable goals. Given that deforestation is the second leading cause of climate change after burning fossil fuels, it notes that corporate responsibility for zero deforestation is key.

He gagged them on time!
	
The top two political authorities handling the countrys law and order have decided to hold a pow-wow with servicemen concerned about the security situation in a certain province and a star- sporting high-up has already exhorted his subordinates not to bring up any issue at the proposed confab without discussing it first with him.

Historic banian tree faces the axe!
	

A top white-collar one serving in a district known for an elephant-shaped rock is planning to cut down a centuries-old landmark banian tree towering over a sensitive environment saying that snakes have made it their home and these snakes have a become a threat to him and his family as they are often seen slithering around his official residence.
The historic banian tree is located nowhere near the official residence of the white-collar high-up and about 10 predecessors of his who occupied this residence had never complained about the threat from snakes, they say.
Both environmentalists and the residents in the area have protested the move to fell the banian tree, but the high-up does not seem to have changed his mind about it, they say.

Jobs for unemployed grads under four stages: Harsha
	
The government will provide jobs for all unemployed graduates under four stages in 2018 and 2019, Minister Harsha de Silva told Parliament today.
The first two groups that had completed their degrees before December 31, 2016 will receive employment this year, and the remaining groups that had graduated before June 30, 2018 will receive employment next year, he said.
Responding to a question raised by JVP leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake whether the external graduates would be considered when providing employment, the minister said they would not be disregarded but that a Cabinet decision had been taken to give priority to internal graduates.
Considering the appeals made by applicants, the maximum age limit for graduate recruitment has been increased from 35 to 45, he said. (Ajith Siriwardana and Yohan Perera)

Mangala should apologise to MR: Bandula
	
The Joint Opposition (JO) today said Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera should apologise to former president Mahinda Rajapaksa for falsely accusing him of allowing the sale of fuel for higher prices when the prices of crude oil were low in the world market.
JO MP Bandula Gunawardana said Minister Samaraweera has charged that the price of a crude oil barrel was USD 40 in the world market but former president Rajapaksa had given a litre of patrol for Rs.122 during his time.
This is completely false. The highest crude oil barrel prices were reported in 2008 which was USD 146 for seven months. It was only in December 2008, the price went down to USD 34. Throughout the year 2008, the average price of a crude oil barrel was USD 97. When the situation was like this, we gave a litre of petrol for Rs.120, he told a news briefing.
He said the statements made by a minister of importance such as Finance Minister Samaraweera should consist of truthful facts.
Minister Samaraweera recently said drug smugglers try to cover their sins by holding high positions in various organizations such as Rotary club and Lions clubs. Later on, he apologised for mentioning the names of the two clubs. Similarly, we urge him to apologise to Mr. Rajapaksa for making false statements, he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Missed to use Lord Nasebys point: Mahinda Samarasinghe
	

The Daily mirror sat with Ports and Shipping Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe to discuss the progress of controversial Sri Lanka  China deal entered into developing Hambantota Port, Chinese investments in Sri Lanka, issues affecting the country in the global and domestic forums and politics.
Excerpts:
QWhat is the progress that has been made in the Hambantota Port Development Project since the signing of the Concession Agreement to entrust the management of the port to two Sri Lankan and Chinese companies in last December
Let me put your question in context. Hambantota Port is managed by two Sri Lankan companies under the name of Hambantota International Port Group (HIPG) / Hambantota International Port Service (HIPS) with Sri Lanka Ports Authority and China Merchants Port being the shareholders. After the Concession Agreement was concluded, volumes handled in the port have increased significantly. Besides I have been informed that discussions are on to set up industries within the Ports Complex which is a sine-qua-non to accelerate port development.

We have consistently taken up theposition that the UNHRC shouldnot be a vehicle for some countriesto achieve their geopolitical strategicobjectives by selectively targeting somecountries and not others who allegedlyviolate international HR norms. Since 2015,we have increased our levels of cooperationby engaging more closely with the Councilthan previously. To answer your question,the US presence or otherwise in that bodywill not affect the Sri Lankan Governmentsposition on its constructive engagementwith the UNHRC

QThe Joint Opposition says that the deal was a sell-out of a strategically important and valuable national asset. Your comments
These are political comments. However, the port concession was the only solution to relieve the debt burden and to commercialize the port.
QThe JO also charges that the Government is to sell vast swathes of lands in Hambantota to the Chinese for the proposed Investment Zone dirt cheap. What have you to say about this allegation
The matter that you referred to doesnt come within my purview.
QAre you content with the USD 1.4 billion paid to Sri Lanka by China for the Hambantota Port
It was a decision taken prior to my assuming duties as the Minister in charge of the subject, through a Framework Agreement concluded in 2016 consequent to Cabinet Approval.

I am certain that thosein the Government whoare responsible willuse Lord Nasebys research,observations and conclusionsappropriately and at theopportune time

QThere is a public perception that Sri Lanka failed to take full advantage of the well-researched statement made in the House of Lords by Lord Naseby in October 2017 on Sri Lankas civil war. Do you agree
While we appreciate Lord Nasebys support for the truth about Sri Lankas conflict, we should avail ourselves of his findings at the correct juncture. The Government is committed to several processes in this connection not least the Resolution of the UN Human Rights Council and its follow up. I am certain that those in Government who are responsible will use Lord Nasebys research, observations and conclusions appropriately and at the opportune time.

Should avail ourselves of his findings at the correct juncture
	Unfortunately failed to convince LTTE to become productive partners in building a brighter future for every Sri Lankan
	Voters more knowledgeable; will not make PC elections a referendum on cost of living
QIs Sri Lanka still facing allegations of the war crime, violation of human rights and violation of the International Humanitarian Law (IHL) and if so, where is the escape route
Well, we knew soon after the conclusion of the conflict that the rump of the defeated LTTE, both locally and internationally, would try to undermine reconciliation and a lasting peace for all Sri Lankans. The allegations that are still to be made in some quarters is a continuation of those intentions. It is unfortunate that the advances made after 2009 and the sea-change we experienced in governance since January 2015 have failed to convince them to become productive partners in building a brighter, more prosperous future for each and every Sri Lankan. The allegations levelled only reveal their desperation to destroy that better future. We have no fear and will face every allegation if and when we are called on to do so. We have demonstrated our commitment to genuine reconciliation and are working with all relevant parties to take that march to genuine peace and reconciliation forward.

It is unfortunate thatthe advances made after2009 and the sea-changewe experienced in governancesince January 2015 has failedto convince them to becomeproductive partners in building
a brighter, more prosperous andsecured future for each and everySri Lankan

QAre you confident that Sri Lanka could escape its huge debt-trap running into over three trillion rupees by 2020 as forecast by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe
The Management of overall public debt is beyond my purview as Minister of Ports and Shipping. The question should be addressed to the relevant authorities. That said, however, as individual Ministers, we were all committed to ensuring higher levels of growth in our activities and fulfilling our ambitions of economic advancement, development with equity and prosperity for all Sri Lankans.
QWhy did the Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA) refuse to reinstate 466 employees, who lost their jobs after the winding up of the Magampura Port Management Company to hand over the management to two new companies, HIPG and HIPS
In keeping with the Concession Agreement whilst the employees were given an option of joining the Hambantota Port based on their qualifications and skills, others were offered employment at Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA) and some took the compensation package, which was far above the industry norm.

 QHow do you see the SLPP victory and SLFP and UNP defeat at the LG polls
I think it was an eye-opener for many people and their parties. In a way, it is proof that there is a vibrant and thriving democracy in Sri Lanka. It is up to the various parties in the fray to communicate their message more clearly based on their own platforms and principles as well as pledges made at presidential and parliamentary elections.

We knew soon after the conclusionof the conflict that the rump of thedefeated LTTE, both locally andinternationally, would try to underminereconciliation and a lasting peace for allSri Lankans
QDont you think the split in the Joint Opposition, SLFP and SLPP would be advantageous to the UNP at the forthcoming PC, Presidential and Parliamentary polls
That is not an outcome that I wish to speculate on. We can only hope for continued free and fair elections based on multi-party democracy that truly reflects the view of the Sri Lankan people, based on a choice among policies, programmes and the several parties electoral platform.
QThe steady increase in the price of essential commodities will no doubt play a key role in the voting pattern of the PC polls scheduled for this year. How is the Government going to tackle this problem
The cost of living is always a matter that concerns any Government looking forward towards future polls. That said, the Sri Lankan public are a little more mature, aware and sensitive in their reaction to domestic and international developments that may impact commodity prices. For our part, we can only promote greater efficiency and productivity that will boost national economic growth. I think Sri Lankan voters are more knowledgeable than that to make the forthcoming elections a referendum on cost of living alone.

While we appreciate LordNasebys support for the truthabout Sri Lankas conflict,we should avail ourselves of hisfindings at the correct juncture. TheGovernment is committed to severalprocesses in this connection not leastthe Resolution of the UN HumanRights Council and its follow up

QExperts on US foreign policy say that whatever is reportedly said or not by outgoing US ambassador Atul Keshap, it is likely that the US State Department would not let Gotabaya Rajapaksa renounce US citizenship until he is cleared from the alleged war crime charges against him. Your comments
Your question requires me to speculate on future US action that is based on their own assessment of several factors. I cannot predict the US policy or actions based on any future events or situations that may or may not arise at some time.
QDo you think the US withdrawal from the UNHRC would be advantageous to Sri Lanka and if so how
The United States policy on engagement with multilateral human rights bodies is wholly consistent with their policy prior to President Obamas election to office in 2008. Their stance on engagement is a matter for the Administration in office. It is their internal matter. It was then (in 2008) that it decided to become more active in the HR Council. Sri Lanka has taken a principled stance on its own engagement with these bodies culminating in the October 2015 UNHRC Resolution and its follow up.
The Council is made up of 47 sovereign member nations of the UN. We have consistently taken up the position that the UNHRC should not be a vehicle for some countries to achieve their geopolitical strategic objectives by selectively targeting some countries and not others who allegedly violate international HR norms. Since 2015, we have increased our levels of cooperation by engaging more closely with the Council than previously.

The allegations levelled onlyreveal their desperation todestroy that better future.We have no fear and will face everyallegation if and when we are called onto do so. We have demonstrated our
commitment to genuine reconciliationand are working with all relevantparties to take that march to genuinepeace and reconciliation forward
To answer your question, the US presence or otherwise in that body will not affect the Sri Lankan Governments position on its constructive engagement with the UNHRC.

Prime Minister Ranil Wickremasinghe has charged that the local media does not give publicity to positive stories but give space for negative ones.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe expressed these sentiments at a function held in Nikaweratiya on Sunday.
The media does not give publicity to positive stories or on those who have succeeded in life. If someone weeps in public or if he or she criticizes the government they are given wide publicity. Ill bet the media will not give at least a little publicity about the development work which we have launched today. At the same time I know that no one will come for a bet with me, the Prime Minister said.
"Maybe the media is jealous about those who have succeeded in life," he said.
He then questioned as to whether the media likes the old way. The media only talks about the previous era; the era in which media men kidnapped he questioned. "The media can't survive unless they attack the government," he added. (Ravindra Prabath Nettasinghe)

Podi Kumarihami fights a lone crusade
	
Despite harassment, torture and threat by Mahiyangana Police, Magistrate
International Day in Support of Victims of Torture; observations held in Kandy

It all started with a two-acre land near the Mahaweli River in Mahiyangana. The land is ideal for those engaged in illicit sand mining.
One day a police constable attached to the Mahiyangana Police station approached the 50-year-old Podi Kumarihami living on the land and wanted the property sold to him. 
Podi Kumarihami had no other place to go as she loved that plot of land. She was selling btel and coconut at Poojanagara in the Mahiyangana town. From the time she refused to sell the land, Podi Kumarihami alleged that she had undergone constant harassment by the Police and the Officer-in-Charge of the Mahiyagana Police. She spelled this story out before a panel of jurists on the International Day in Support of Victims of Torture observations in Kandy.
The Panel comprised of Ven. Dr. Atipola Mangala, Senior Attorney Tissa Manatunge,Commissioner of Human Rights Commission Dr. (Ms.) Deepika Udugama, Regional Human Rights Commissioner Kumudini Vithane and school Principal Kamalika Dissanayake. The compere was Rt. Rev. Nandana Manatunge - the Director of Human Rights Commission in Kandy. 
Podi Kumarihami said that she was a mother of five children between the ages of 19 years and 13. She said that she was a street vendor who sold local produce at Mahiyangana. According to her, since 2006 she had been facing serious threats and harassment due to her refusal to sell the only land that was in her possession to the Police in Mahiyangana. 
She alleged that her 17-year-old son was arrested several times. On November 5, 2017, she alleged that her son Sumesh was arrested by Mahiyangana Police and tortured following which he was hospitalized to treat his injuries. 
She alleged that though the local Magistrate was informed of this repeated torture, she did not take notice of the complaint but said that she had to honour the Police. She had also said that the Magistrate was married to a Police Officer. Podikumari Hamini was later arrested for not wearing a white saree when she appeared in the Court and remanded for 14 days. The criminal case continues against her and she had been warned by the Magistrate not to retain a lawyer from Mahiyanga in order to defend herself. 
On August 15, 2017, she was arrested again. She charged that no female Police officer was present during the time of her interrogation. She recounted that police officers beat her and tried to force her into the Police vehicle. She said her son-in-law Asanka Dilshan who rushed to her help was also beaten. The Police officers were alleged to have stated that they would find drugs in her house, before the day ends. 
On the August 17, in a harrowing tale, Podi Kumarihami said that Police officers planted drugs at her house and that her son-in-law was arrested despite his defiance. She said she was allowed on Police bail and her son-in-law was remanded for 14 days. 
On the same day, policemen from Mahiyangana Police arrived at her house and attempted to arrest her daughter Chamila Malkanthi, but when she objected to the arrest, she was physically harassed by the Mahiyangana Police OIC and two other constables named Senadheera and Wimalsena. They caught her by her hair and dashed her head against the wall. When she knelt and pleaded, she was kicked by the OIC with his boots. They warned if she had complained, she would be shot. By August 20, 2017, Podi Kumarihami was summoned to the Police Station and was warned not to pursue any complaint against the Police and if she did so, she would have to face dire consequences.
It is at this time that Podi Kumarihami complained to the Human Rights Commission. Her case No: HRC/BD/147/17 was scheduled for hearing on November 27. Podikumai Hami and Dilshan alleged that their arrest by the Mahiyagana Police was an act of reprisal.

She said her son-in-law Asanka Dilshan who rushed to her help was also beaten. The Police officers were alleged to have stated that they would find drugs in her house, before the day ends
She stated that she had written to the Police Commission, the Attorney General, the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka and the DIG Badulla range and Special Investigations Unit had already commenced investigations. However, Podi Kumarihami alleged the investigations have been completed. 
She said that her safety, her dignity, her sons education and her ability to engage in her livelihood is at stake. 
The Civil Society who were present passed an eight-point resolution calling upon the State to ensure effective protection and redress for Podi Kumarihami. They also called on the Judicial Service Commission to conduct an inquiry into the Mahiyangana Magistrate pertaining to these incidents and urged the National Police Commission to inquire into the alleged conduct of the Mahiyangana Police officers as well.

President now understands Google Loon project: Harin
	
President Maithripala Sirisena did not have an understanding on Google Loon project initially but now he does, Minister of Telecom and Digital Infrastructure Development Harin Fernando said today.
Minister Fernando said this in response to a question raised by Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) MP Bimal Ratnayake as to whether the Google Loon project was delayed because the Telecommunication Regulatory Commission (TRC) was against it.
TRC is an institution which is under the purview of President Maithirpala Sirisena. President did not have an understanding on the project initially but now he does understand it, the Minister said.
The International Telecommunication Union (ITU) also had an issue on Google Loon project and refused to give the spectrum license initially, the Minister added while informing the House that he will leave for Geneva today have a discussion with ITU. He said this discussion would be a decisive one as the project could go ahead if ITU agrees to give the spectrum license. The Minister thereby said the project is on and it was never cancelled.
Google Loon project became a joke for the Sri Lankan people as many of them thought Google balloons were going to be used to provide thousands of WIFI positions and that the project had ended with the balloon falling. The balloon never fell down as the landing was pre-planned. Also, the objective of the Google Loon project was to provide 4G technology to all corners of the country.

Rajapaksa probably  loves what  he sees
	

It would be apt to say that Rajapaksa would have had little or no chance to reach the pinnacle in politics if there was no LTTE

Nine years after the demise of rebel leader Velupillai Prabakaran he is still in the news. This time the slain tiger leaders name was brought under the spotlight by former State Minister for Childrens Affairs Vijeyakala Maheswaran. One thing that the people of this country must fathom is that though it was possible to wipe out the LTTE erasing the name of Prabakaran is something impossible. This is because the one time tiger leader is considered as a demi God in the North. 
Vijeyakala was publicly bashed for hero-worshipping Prabakaran. The joint opposition called for stern action against her. The UNP didnt remain silent over the issue either. Now we hear that she has left the country and is in London. 
The South has been vociferous over the activities in the North, especially when the Tamil community wished to commemorate the rebel terrorists who died in the conflict. But if we analyse the psyche of the Southern politicians, the most accomplished parliamentarian from this province, Mahinda Rajapaksa, came to power during the height of the LTTE. 
It would be apt to say that Rajapaksa would have had little or no chance to reach the pinnacle in politics if there was no LTTE. Rajapaksas staunch promise once sworn in as president was to finish off the war. This task not only made him a hero, the milestones passed during the take over of towns on the map to the North were given much publicity. The SMS campaign carried out by the Government using a mobile phone service provider confirms this. 

Vijeyakala was publicly bashed for hero-worshipping Prabakaran. The joint opposition called for stern action against her. The UNP didnt remain silent over the issue either
World history has shown that arrogant rulers have jumped at the opportunity to go to war, when they knew that it would help their survival. Rajapaksa rode on this popularity wave for a long time and chanted a mantra about winning the war until it became a sore to the ears of the majority of the citizens.

People of this country were so sick and tired of the old war story and the man who took much of the credit for this success that they voted for a change at the 2015 Presidential Election. 
The country moved from dictatorship to democracy under a unity Government, which the Tamil minority too supported. 
Though the majority of Sri Lankans dont wish for a LTTE resurgence, the talk about the LTTE helps bring Mahinda Rajapkasa and his able brother Gotabaya to the minds of the people. For these two Rajapaksas even a suggestion that the LTTE could surface is like sweet music to their ears. But publicly theyd deny wanting to see the LTTE return. 
We cant forget the fact that it was the LTTEs wish to see Mahinda Rajapaksa be elected as president at the 2015 Presidential Election. Prabakaran with his warrior mentality preferred to go to war with Rajapaksa than see himself be seated at a table talking peace with the other candidate at the election Ranil Wickremesinghe. Prabakaran understood war, but knew little about taking on a politician from the South. There is a saying in the Sinhalese community that one should think twice before taking on a man from the South because the Southerners are ruthless and also have warrior mentalities. 
The recent spate of killings and shootings in some parts of the island have brought back memories of the war, that concluded nine years ago. Almost every other day we get to hear of some violent incident being reported in newspapers. If this unstable environment continues for some more time it will lay the ideal platform for the Rajapaksas to return to power. 
The remaining period up to the 2020 Presidential Election is crucial for this country. Burdened by enormous foreign debts and a cold war between the President and the Prime Minister of the country, this unity Government is currently on life support. 
The 19th Amendment to the Constitution blocks Mahinda Rajapaksa from becoming Sri Lankas President for the third time. But to hell with the Constitution, Rajapaksa showed that he is still the most marketable person in Sri Lankan politics by spearheading the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) to reign supreme at the last Local Government Polls. 

The talk about the LTTE brings MR and Gota to the minds of the people. For these two Rajapaksas even a suggestion that the LTTE could surface is like sweet music to their ears
Though the former president brought peace to this country he will be seen as the need of the hour if the country plunges into an unstable war -ike situation where there are shootings and contractual killings. 
Vijeyakala did Mahinda Rajapaksa a favour by talking about slain tiger rebel Prabakaran. The immature Vijeyakala fled the country leaving the experienced Rajapaksa to ride on the wave she created. Rajapaksa possibly loves the development in the political scene which suggests to the outside world that this nation is functioning without a leader!

Reparations Bill to be presented to Parliament today
	
The 'Office of Reparations' Bill which is aimed at providing legal provisions for the establishment of the Office for Reparations, to identify war affected people eligible for reparations, has been placed on the Order Paper of Parliament meant for today
Like the Office of Missing Persons, the establishment of this new office is part of the matters envisaged in the UNHRC resolution on Sri Lanka adopted on October 1, 2015. It is meant to identify aggrieved persons eligible for reparations, and to provide for the provision of individual and collective reparations to such persons; to repeal the Rehabilitation of Persons, Properties and Industries Authority Act, No. 29 of 198, and is to be presented to Parliament today.
Responsibilities of this office will include receiving recommendations with regard to reparations to be made to aggrieved persons from the Office on Missing Persons established under the Office on Missing Persons or such other relevant bodies or institutions, to receive applications for reparations from aggrieved persons or representatives of such aggrieved persons and to verify the authenticity of such application, for the purpose of assessing the eligibility for reparations, to identify the aggrieved persons who are eligible for reparations as well as their level of need, to identify and collate information relating to previous or on-going reparation programmes carried out by the State, including any expenditure on similar reparation programmes through a centralized database, and to make rules with regard to ensuring the effective functioning of the Office for Reparations.
The Office for Reparations, if established, will consist of five members appointed by the President on the recommendation of the Constitutional Council. The Constitutional Council shall recommend three names out of the members of the Office for Reparations to be appointed as the Chairperson of the Office for Reparations. One of the members recommended shall be appointed by the President as the Chairperson of the Office for Reparations. A member could serve for a period of three years.
However, the members of this office will be deemed to be public servants for the purpose of the Bill as per the Penal Code and the Bribery Act and the Evidence Ordinance. (Yohan Perera)

The Jothipala Magic
	
THERE WERE TIMES HE FORGETS LUNCH, HIS FATHER AND EVERYTHING ELSE, BUT WOULD LISTEN TO MUSIC ON RADIO
	HAD HE BEEN BORN IN US OR IN INDIA, HE WOULD HAVE BEEN RICHER, MORE FAMOUS AND MORE RENOWNED

From Eddie Jayamanne to Lal Weerasinghe, there is a space of about 30 years. H. R. Jothipala, who sang for every leading actor that came between them, traversed those 30 years and enflamed an entire nation. To assess the worth of the man on the basis of all if not most of those 5000 odd songs he performed is beyond my abilities, so suffice it to say that Jothipala embodied certain qualities and people took to those qualities the moment he appeared on stage.
He did not cut a figure that could reckon with any of the actors he performed for (indeed, when he went ahead and acted in several films in the late seventies, he looked out of odds with his genial self), but it appealed to more than three generations and the generations that followed them. It is said that we all begin with Amaradeva and end somewhere with Jothipala. This piece is for Jothipala.
There are vocalists who are born and vocalists who are bred. Jothipala, in that sense, was both born and bred. He was born Hettiarachchige Lawrence Reginald Jothipala on February 12, 1936, in the loud, brash and vibrant town of Dematagoda. His father was a tailor, his mother a housewife. The Jothipalas were not really poor, but being artisans they were not affluent either. Simon Nawagaththegama once told a story about how he got to love classical music by the fact that the only radio in his village was tuned on to a channel dedicated to the genre. Jothipala grew up on music to a radio that was also tuned to a particular channel at a tea kiosk neighbouring his fathers shop, where he would deliver lunch every day. There were times when he would forget the lunch, forget the father, forget everything else, and just listen to the music on that radio. He would almost always get a beating for that. As expected.
Being relatively poor, his mother and father entertained high hopes for him, but circumstances were strained enough as they were, since he happened to be the eldest in a family of five other siblings (four sisters and two brothers). They depended heavily on the earnings of the father. While they did manage to survive, it was not always easy. (Young Jothipala once complained that he did not have a proper suit for the New Year, and having cried at it, he got his grandmother to sew and send him a pair of shorts just before the auspicious hour dawned.) Given the rampant poverty within the family, the parents wanted their children to study. Being the eldest would have made them entertain especially high expectations of young H. R., but the boy just got hooked on to more and more music. The beatings continued, naturally.
He received his education initially at St. Lawrences College in Maradana and later, closer to his hometown, St. Johns College in Dematagoda. No matter how much they berated him, though, the parents were unable to stop him from diddling around with music (at both schools, he used to perform in front of his friends, often using empty tins, an indication of the type of music he would become famous for in later years). They then took him out and enrolled him at the Industrial School in Maradana. But even there, he neglected his studies, and two months later, he was taken out. Hoping to exorcise him, the family decided to send him back to their hometown in Matara. Even that didnt work: he merely began attending musical shows. The truth was that by now, Jothipala had decided that, come what may, he wanted to become a singer.
He finally got his way when he visited Silverphone Studios, where he chanced across several stalwarts from the industry at the time - Latha and Dharmadasa Walpola, Mohideen Baig, and of course Rukmani Devi - recording playback songs for movies. A few visits later, he met Maurice Dahanayake, who got him to accompany Wasantha Sandanayake with the song Mahaweli Nadiye.He had to shout out just one word: thotiyo. This debut helped him get aboard several radio shows; one of those shows was Jayagrahayaka Pelapali, through which he was able to make the acquaintance of several renowned instrumentalists - Nadaraja, the tabla player; Rocksamy, the violinist, and T. F. Latif, the clarinetist - all of whom hailed from outside the Sinhala Buddhist milieu they would pander to in song after song. Then as now, our music industry was genuinely multicultural, and Jothipala, who himself came from a somewhat multifaceted background, found his place in the sun with these performers. Towering over them, incidentally, was R. A. Chandrasena, who composed music for the film Surathali, for which Jothipala provided his voice. This was in 1956.
Regi Siriwardena observed somewhere that, great as her talent was, it was unfortunate that Rukmani Devi was born to the darkest period of Sri Lankan music, a period which thrived on copying musical pieces from outside, in particular India. Certainly, it is one of the great ironies of our music industry that this culture of bastardizing songs went hand in hand with nationalist, chauvinist calls for singing our own songs, and though to consider whether vocalists born to this era were unfortunate is beyond the scope of this tribute, it is reasonable to surmise that Jothipala was fortunate in moving to a more original musical sphere, after which he met the great Premasiri Khemadasa. Khemadasa, I have heard, carried on a love/hate relationship with Jothipala, who was miles away from the composers classical roots. Once when his two most popular songs from Duleeka - Seetha Rae Yameand Adara Mal Pawane- were nominated at the Sarasavi Awards, it was widely believed that Sanath Nandasiri, who sang the former, would clinch the award. Naturally, this belief was shared by Khemadasa himself, and naturally again, when Jothipala was announced as the winner, he is reported to have left in disgust. Such encounters were brief, and they did not result in the vocalist and the composer leaving each other, since over the years Khemadasa gave out some of Jothipalas most scintillating pieces (remember Oba Langa Inna from Wasana Or Ma Prarthana from Lasanda Or Oba Soya Ennam from Gimhane Gee Naade). To me, nurtured in largely classical musical environment, these are what define Jothipalas versatility: they proved, more than anything else, that he was an artiste capable of going beyond his populist, peechan base he lived for.
Indeed, I was surprised to learn how prodigious the mans career was. Well over 5000 songs, many of which paired him with his (in more ways than one) counterpart Angeline Goonetilake, called for countless recordings, concerts, and radio shows which by themselves would have consumed his time, never mind the tours that took him abroad, from England to the Middle East. And yet, some of his associates have told me, he was always on the lookout for work, always by the side of his friends, and never hesitant to help those who needed his help. I have heard of instances where, having run out of money, this gentle man had to borrow suits from friends to wear at live and televised shows. It is not unreasonable to assume here that were he born in America or even India, he would have been richer, more famous, and more renowned.
As things stood though, the man was content in being where he was. Sure, he was not a mansion dweller by any stretch of the imagination, but he earned enough to wade through some of the most turbulent years to greet this country. Politically, he wasnt aligned to any party, though when the Premadasa administration (which found favour among artists in a way that was unparalleled by any administration before or after it, barring perhaps that of Mahinda Rajapaksa) recruited vocalists for its project, Gam Udawa, he was there, along with the likes of Niranjala Sarojini. It was at one of the Gam Udawa shows that he met his end, on July 7, 1987. He was 51 at the time. Vijaya Kumaratunga, for whom he sang in the 70s and 80s, would be killed less than a year later. He was all of 42. It was a strange time to live in, stranger to die in.
Among all those collaborations, there was one composer who eluded him. Somewhere in the 1960s, this composer had requested Jothipala to sing a song for a film he was scoring. He hadnt approached him before. Not knowing his methods and his way with other musicians perhaps, Jothipala had simply replied: Give me a day, Ill come over, Ill record once, and Ill go. That had apparently irked and ticked off the composer. I dont really know exactly what transpired between the two of them there, but from what I have heard he never spoke nor came across the singer until about 10 years later. Again, there was a film he was scoring, and someone had suggested the mans name. Giving him one more chance (we can assume), he had made his request again. The singer, predictably, gave the same reply, and for some reason or the other, the composer didnt get angry this time.
He instead decided to try out this mans claim (for in his experience, I am willing to bet, he hadnt come across a vocalist who could record a song perfectly in one go). So he gave him a date and time for the recording.
What happened next surprised this composer. True to his word, Jothipala came over, recorded once, and left. The recording was perfect and moreover in tune with the sequence of the film. I dont know what the composer would have thought then, but I am sure he reflected on his previous encounter with the singer with some humility.
The song, Kanden Kandata, was a hit, as was the film it was featured in Tharanga.
The composer had a name, by the way. W. D. Amaradeva. Yes, Amaradeva.

Underworld protecting senior minister: PM instructs officials to submit more info.
	
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe today informed parliament that he instructed the relevant authorities to look into the media report that some underworld figures were protected by a senior minister and assured to submit in parliament about the incident.
He said he directed the officials to find more information on the matter from police officials based on the newspaper article.
Responding to a question raised by joint opposition MP Padma Udayashantha Gunasekara, the Premier said the joint opposition had no right to talk about it as they nurtured underworld, rapists and fraudsters during their time.
Meanwhile, responding to a question raised by MP Gunasekara, Law and Order Deputy Minister Nalin Bandara Jayamaha said the Ava criminal gang was not a terrorist organisation operating in the North as rumoured in the South and that it had not committed any murder or inflicted serious injuries to anyone.
He said Ava group was operated by some youngsters who were influenced by violent scenes in Tamil films.
"I and the subject minister made an inspection tour in the North recently. We realised that Ava group was not a terrorist group involved in any murder or terrorists acts as known by the people in the South. They are a group of youth below the age of 18 and was influenced by the violent scenes in South Indian Tamil films," he said.
He said a programme would be launched to rehabilitate and reunite the youth with their parents. (Ajith Siriwardana and Yohan Perera)

## Title: WHEN WILL FIL CHING OF FUNDS STOP AT SCHOOLS

WHEN WILL FIL CHING OF FUNDS STOP AT SCHOOLS    
	

The law is yet to be enforced on the culprits for filchingpublic funds running uptoRs 2 million!
	A sum of Rs 350,000, which was to be deposited under the school development society fund in aid of the school development, has not been deposited
	20 fans in the hostel were found to be nonfunctional and a large part of the ceiling had broken down
	The Auditor Generals Department has forwarded many queries related to financial administration
	

Many revelations pertaining to the misuse of public funds have been made on a number of occasions in the recent past by Sathya Gaweshanaya. Since the misuse of public funds in the education sector has gotten out of hand and become a menace many opine that this issue should be severely dealt with. Critics feel that prompt action should be taken to eradicate this malpractice. The majority of complaints made by the public regarding this matter are being handled in a trivial manner; the process of inquiring into such matters and the enforcement of law against such activities being absolutely sluggish! In this edition of our expose we probe into the misuse of funds allocated for school development. 
Although its said that most students receive free education in Sri Lanka one might still wonder or question whether this education is really free in this island. This is because when giving an education to the children in this country parents are heavily burdened having to pay school fees and admission fees, apart from making similar other expenses. Facility fees and service charges of most of the leading schools, charged annually, in Sri Lanka have somewhat exceeded Rs 5000. In addition to that money is being collected from time to time throughout the year as a result of school authorities highlighting various causes. These causes have become an enormous issue. 
One classic example of money being collected for such matters comes from Senanayake Central College Madampe. In this school as much as Rs 20 million had been allocated by the Government to build a much needed lavatory system. (the old lavatory system that existed for quite some time was in a dilapidated state hence the students were forced to endure much difficulties). Hence the news of the possibility of using new toilets gave some to the troubled minds of these students. 
Procurement procedures not followed
The authorities took the initiative to start this long awaited project, but dealings were done in an arbitrary manner with no proper procurement procedures being followed. Thus the construction of the new lavatory continued with no attention being given to complaints that were made by various parties who were concerned about the standard of the facility which was at a low ebb. Later, following many complaints, the Deputy Principal of the school along with a group of teachers did a site inspection. They came across a multitude of faults pertaining to the relative construction. A report was made after the inspection which highlighted the imperfections. 
In the report it has been mentioned that no arrangements have been made to install wash basins. The other shortcomings are the unavailability of cement louvers, windows being fitted not keeping to a plan and two types of bricks being used on the walls with no proper levelling. Some of the defects have been covered using plastering. Earth has been used to form the foundation without compacting. It has also been identified that the mixing ratio of materials is poor. Sand has been mixed with mud for plastering purposes. The timber used for the roof hasnt been properly desiccated and no timber protection has been used. These shortcomings have contributed to toilets of low quality being made. Soon these new toilets were demolished following an inspection on the advice of relevant engineers and technical Officers in 2016. This was done under the condition of constructing a new toilet facility which has to date not happened. 

When the Principal of Senanayake Central College was contacted regarding this issue he stated that the Ministry was informed about the new toilets, but refused to divulge information to the media
The law is yet to be enforced on the culprits for filching public funds running upto Rs 2 million! The Minister of Education Akila Viraj Kariyawasam, having visited the school on 31st July 2016, warned that action would be be taken against the culprits soon. The Old Boys Association of the school as well as the parents, students and teachers of the school have informed the President and the respective authorities about this issue from time to time. They had made appeals in this regard yet all efforts proved to be futile. Informed sources of the school say that a high ranking administrative officer is safeguarding these culprits!. 


We have also made complaints to the Presidential Secretariat which has forwarded the respective complaints to the Ministry of Education. Yet no action has been taken so far regarding the new toilet facility. Its pointless. No matter how much we speak regarding this matter nothing has been done to look into our plight. The school has no toilets to fulfill the needs of the children, said J.A.W Jayawardena the Secretary of the Old Boys Association of the school. 
When the Principal of Senanayake Central College was contacted regarding this issue he stated that the Ministry was informed about the new toilets, but refused divulge information to the media. He said that according to the Establishment Code prior permission must be obtained from the Ministry of Education when making statements to the media on any subject. 
There is another story of funds being mismanaged and this comes from Yasodara Ladies College Gampaha. In this school the administration of funds has been subject to ridicule! A sum of Rs 350000, which was to be deposited under the school development society fund in aid of the school development, has not been deposited. This money is now in the possession of a person with high authority in the school. The high ranked person, on realizing that the situation was not benefiting him, credited the money immediately to the respective account through the Treasurer of the Development Society. Subsequently the culprits, who are well informed and possess skills of survival, wrote a letter to the Gampaha Zonal Education Director stating that the monies were not credited before and they are being re-deposited because the account is being reconciled! 
How culprits operate
What must be ridiculed is that these culprits not resolving the matter with regard to the account immediately and waiting till Rs 350,000 had to be deposited to attend to this matter. (They themselves will know from where they found a sum of Rs 3  lakhs for re-depositing!) A copy of the letter sent to the Zonal Director of Education is presented with this article. This will help readers understand how financial administration is handled at the school. 
Although there have been allegations where money has been charged by the school administration from students they havent been proven. Also Sathya Gaweshanaya has previously revealed how money has been charged by schools with regard to school admission, which is in contravention to the Government circulars. Also there had been an incident where twins of a teacher, who were eligible to enter the school, were rejected. This was despite a discussion pertaining to the matter and held with the Provincial Public Accounts Committee in attendance. 
According to the report released by the Provincial Director of Internal Audits as well as the circular issued by the Secretary of Education, 20 students who were enrolled (based on aspects of close proximity) were contrary to the Government circular. The committee then decided that injustice had been done to these children who were qualified. They has also pointed out that there had been shortcomings in the exam evaluation process. Now it has been decided to conduct a preliminary inquiry to probe the defaults which were created due to irregularities. The victims are yet to receive justice and the law is yet to be enforced on the wrongdoers. In this regard it is important to make note that Yashodara Balika Vidyalaya Gampaha is a Provincial School while the previously mentioned Madampe Senanayake Central College is a National School. 
Ananda College Colombo, also a national school, is administered by the Ministry of Education. A special audit related to the school was conducted in 2017 and the audit query was issued in 2018. Ananda College Colombo, founded by Col. Olcott on 1st November 1886, consisted of a student body of 6537 students by 2017. According to the audit inquiry 282 personnel were serving as academic staff while 78 personnel were serving the school as non-academic staff. 
Further, according to the audit inquiry, fixed deposits of the school between the period 1993 to 2013 and amounting to a value exceeding 4 billion by end of January 2017, had been maintained as fixed deposits. This was despite the option of utilizing the monies in the deposit under formal authorization in terms of qualitative development of the school. 
According to the final audit carried out at the school and accounts as at the end of 2016 , the value of the school bus was declared at Rs 3,583,196 under fixed assets. At the same time the accumulated depreciation value of the bus also remained the same. Annually the value of the bus was depreciated by 20%. Details of whether or not the bus was still in use were not included. The above data and facts werent properly calculated and included in the final accounts. 

According to the audit inquiry the school building which shelters the students of grade 10, which is 14 metres in length and 10 metres in width and 140 square feet in extent, was equipped with three air conditioners and occupied by an office of the Old Boys Association. The electricity bills amounted to Rs 7,272,737 up to September 2017. These bills have been paid by the School Development Society. Twenty five different accounts have been maintained under various Associations and Units of the School Development Society. Proper records of receipts and payments have not been maintained. The audit query revealed that some accounts carried minus values and the total loss of all societies summed up to Rs135,642. 
The usage of school vehicles as well as the present situation of the hostels were also subjected to the audit. At the time of the investigation 20 fans in the hostel were found to be nonfunctional and a large part of the ceiling had broken down in the bedroom areas which housed children studying in grades 8,9 and 10. 
At a time when the Old Boys Association of Ananda College wasnt established as a Recognized Association as per the circular of 21st June 1995, the Secretary of Education had instructed the schools principal to appoint a representative of an unaccepted Old Student Association in connection with year one admission for the year 2018, which is also questionable.  

There is another story of funds being mismanaged and this comes from Yasodara Ladies College Gampaha. In this school the administration of funds has been subject to ridicule!
The Auditor Generals Department has forwarded many queries related to financial administration. These queries are supported by a lengthy audit inquiry. When the Principal of Ananda College was contacted regarding these matters he said that he was unaware of these issues.
These issues are only pertaining to three schools in the island. With regard to these three institutes it is quite evident how the enforcement of the law has been slow. There is an incident where the father of a student, upon questioning financial issues at the General Meeting of the Old Boys Association of Bandaranayake Vidyalaya Gampaha, had been verbally assaulted by the school authorities. This was reported in 2016. When we inquired into the matter using the Right to Information Act, the Ministry of Education announced that the respective school principal was warned following an inquiry. 


These children, who are currently being educated in these schools, will secure power one day and rule the country. Given the shaky way in which finances are managed at these schools, these children, from a tender age, will start thinking that law and order are ineffective.
Therefore in order to end these corrupt practices the ongoing investigations in schools, where there have been financial irregularities, must be expedited. The administration arms of schools must be regulated and the collecting of money from children unlawfully must be checked.
