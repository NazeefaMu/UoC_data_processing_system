Fears of breakaway rebel cricket league sparks ICC probe
	
New Zealand Cricket has been drawn into an International Cricket Council-led investigation targeting a possible breakaway rebel cricket league, New Zealand based STUFF news agency reported.It has been revealed that Ten Sports, a subsidiary of Indian-based Essel Group, has registered domains with similar names to national bodies, sparking widespread controversy and speculation about its motives.The ICC has moved to focus its investigation on Essel, the company behind failed rebel cricket league the ICL, as fears grow over the launch of another rival Twenty20 competition, possibly in the untapped United States market. ?Essel registered the names New Zealand Cricket Limited, Kiwi Cricket Limited and Aotearoa Cricket Limited with the Companies Office. Alerted to the issue, NZC managed to block the first named being used - due to copyright laws - but was powerless to stop the others.New Zealand is among the first countries targeted, along with Australia, Scotland and England.The Guardian reported these moves by Essel, which ran the rebel ICL tournament from 2007 until its collapse in 2009, and Ten Sports, the host broadcaster for home international matches played by West Indies, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, South Africa and Zimbabwe, has left elite cricket bosses questioning whether fresh moves are afoot for another breakaway cricket tournament.It may also signal a challenge of the establishment, with those five nations openly disenfranchised after the power grab by "the big three" - India, England and Australia.Lalit Modi, IPL founder and outspoken critic of the ICC, said in a tweet it was "about time this happened".The issue came to a head at an ICC meeting in Dubai last week. NZC's representative on the board, Greg Barclay, said it became aware of the registration of those companies last December and has since alerted the ICC to the activities."We've been concerned that some of the names included 'New Zealand' and 'cricket' in them and we referred it to the ICC as soon as we became aware that there might be some activity going on without knowing what that was," Barclay said. "Our position was to let the ICC deal with is as they saw fit."When I was at the ICC meeting it was a discussion point, because they were aware that it wasn't just New Zealand where these registrations were taking place."The discussion was that we need to make some enquiries to find out what's going on, and not least of all have a conversation with Ten Sports, who are the broadcasting arm of Essel."While there is clear intent, Barclay declined to speculate whether the name registrations were the first step to take on the cricket establishment."It would be too early to say that. We haven't seen any other activity and we're not aware of anything happening that would give rise to any speculation around leagues or whatever."It's a bit early to draw any conclusions, but let's see what the enquiries the ICC may reveal."Hopefully, they can explain what they're up to and their response determines what happens next. I know the legal team at the ICC are already starting to make those enquiries."Another rebel league has the potential to create conflict and controversy, but also offer more choice for players.The ICL was dogged with problems during its fleeting existence. Players were not paid in full and allegations of corruption later emerged with former Black Caps opener Lou Vincent admitting fixing games in 2008.?(Stuff.co.nz)

Wigneswaran defends raising convicts? issue with Modi
	
Northern Province Chief Minister C.V. Wigneswaran yesterday strongly defended his action of forwarding to Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi a representation, seeking the release of four convicts of a case of rape and murder, popularly called the Premananda case.
Addressed to Mr. Modi, the petition was signed by five persons, including K. Sivathy and Chandradevi, daughter and wife of Premananda?s secretary Kamalananda, who was given double life term that had to run consecutively. The signatories contended that their relatives had been in prison in Tamil Nadu for over 20 years.
In an interview with The Hindu over phone from Jaffna, Mr. Wigneswaran, who passed on the representation to Mr. Modi during the latter?s visit to Sri Lanka in mid-March, said one of the signatories to the representation [Ms Sivathy] was from his State and since it was well known that he [Mr. Wigneswaran] would be meeting Mr. Modi, the request had come to him for presenting the communication.
?No impropriety?
?There is no impropriety in forwarding a representation to the person concerned,? he said, adding that ?it is up to the Indian government to act as per law.?
The Chief Minister recalled that when Manmohan Singh was Prime Minister, he did the same thing on an issue concerning fishermen. A self-styled godman, Premananda, who hailed from Sri Lanka, established ?Premananda Ashram? near Viralimalai of Pudukottai district in Tamil Nadu in 1989. The case pertained to the rape of 13 inmates and the murder of a male inmate, which came to light in November 1994. He was given two consecutive life terms by the Pudukottai District and Sessions Court in August 1997 after a 14-month-long trial. Six others were also convicted and given varying punishments. In December 2002, the Madras High Court confirmed the findings of the trial court and the Supreme Court had also dismissed the appeal. Premananda died in February 2011 at a private hospital in Chennai where he was undergoing treatment for liver failure. He was 59.
Asked about his description of the Premananda case as false in his letter to Mr Modi, the Chief Minister said ?there is nothing for me to comment? about a case that had taken place in India.
Describing Premananda as a ?very close friend,? Mr. Wigneswaran said he had known him for long.(The Hindu)

<U+200B>Writing to Modi;Did Wigneswaran break protocol?
	
		 		 
		 
			
Northern Province Chief Minister C.V.Wigneswaran may have broken protocol when he officially wrote to Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi requesting him to consider releasing four Sri Lankan Tamils sentenced to life imprisonment in the 1994 Premananda rape and murder case, Sri Lankan officials told The New Indian Express. ?
A Foreign Ministry official said that as per protocol, the Chief Minister should send his letter to the Foreign Ministry first. The Foreign Ministry will, in turn, send it to the destination through the Foreign Ministry of the country concerned.
However, in the case of the Northern Province Chief Minister this diplomatic ?route is not insisted upon these days because of the close relations existing between Lanka and India, he added. The protocol is not uniformly applied. ?
?And, at any rate, the Northern Chief Minister has written to Modi in the past, without any objections from Colombo,? the official pointed out.
In his official letter dated March 14, 2015, Wigneswaran told Modi that he was forwarding documents sent by one K.Sivathy, daughter of R. Kamalananda, convict No: 4220.
?Since the girl?s father and mother hail from our (Northern) province, I take the liberty of forwarding the said documents for your kind consideration. Mr.Ram Jethmalani who is known to me, is fully aware of the false case filed,? Wigneswaran said.
The documents, addressed to Modi, were signed by immediate family members of the convicts R. Kamalananda; S. Balendra; S. Sathishkumar; and S. Nandakumar.
They convicts? relations claimed that a ?travesty of justice? had taken place. And with the Indian Supreme Court confirming the sentence, release had ?become ??impossible?.
Pleading for Modi?s good offices to get them released, they said: ? Our dear ones have been in prison for more than 20 years now. The best years of their lives are gone and our lives have also been affected very much. It might be noted Sir, that they are not convicted for any positive act of crime but for abetment only.?
