Video: Gunaratnam says change won?t help
	
	Frontline Socialist Party (FSP) politburo member Kumar Gunaratnam today vowed to continue politics in Sri Lanka and said replacing the Mahinda Rakapaksa Government with a Maithripala Sirisena Government would only provide temporary relief to the burning issues in this country.
	?It will be like an interval in hell. People are fed up with one rule and are so eager for a change. The so called change would not provide lasting solutions to the plight of the people. It would only provide temporary relief,? he told a news conference in Colombo today.
	Mr. Gunaratnam, who was deported from Sri Lanka in 2012, returned to the country this morning. He said there was a political force which delayed his return.

Hakeem rejects govt. charges
	
	Sri Lanka Muslim Congress (SLMC) leader Rauff Hakeem said today his party neither demanded a separate administrative district nor had any secret agreement with the TNA to amalgamate North and East as alleged by the government.
	Mr. Hakeem said the Muslim Congress was formed as a result of the fight to separate North and East.
	?The government is making allegations that the SLMC and the TNA have secret agreement to amalgamate the North and the East. We strongly reject that allegation and regret even the President is making such allegations on stage. We do not have any hidden agendas between us. We left the government to uphold good governance in the country,? Hakeem said.
	He told a news conference that the SLMC condemned the allegation that they were demanding a separate district or province in East and said it was the government that suggested appointing a separate Additional Divisional Secretary in Amapara to facilitate the Tamil speaking majority in the coastal area in Ampara District.
	?During the discussions with the government, it was suggested appointing a separate Additional Divisional Secretary (or AGA) to resolve administrative problems of 96 per cent of Tamil speaking people in the coastal areas of the Ampara District. ?
	?As a result, the government appointed an Additional Divisional Secretary a month ago to decentralise administration in the district. The same thing happened in the Vavuniya District, where such separate Divisional Secretary was appointed to facilitate Sinhala people. But the government is spreading false news that we are demanding a separate district,? he said.
	Mr. Hakeem said the government was spreading false news among the Sinhala Buddhists regarding SLMC principles to create wrong picture about them in the minds of Sinhala people.
	UNP Leadership Council President Karu Jayasuriya said the Temple Trees had become a political office which created false news regarding opposition candidates.
	Mr. Jayasuriya alleged that the State media were being used to sling mud at opposition politicians.
	Democratic People's Front leader Mano Ganeshan said the Tamils, Muslims and Sinhalese had got a good opportunity to join hands and move forward after the war was completed.
He requested the government not to damage the re-union of all the communities by spreading false news and said the government must be happy about this reunion if it really loved the country. (Ajith Siriwardana)

UN to avoid holding meetings on Vesak Day
	
	On the instructions of President Mahinda Rajapaksa, the Permanent Mission of Sri Lanka to the United Nations in New York successfully negotiated a Resolution which was adopted by consensus on December 29, 2014 whereby the United Nations General Assembly acknowledged the significance of the Day of Vesak observed in many member countries, the External Affairs Ministry said.
	It invited the United Nations bodies at Headquarters and other duty stations, to avoid holding meetings on that Day. To this end, the Resolution also encourages this arrangement to be taken into account when formulating future calendars of conferences and meetings.
	?
	President Rajapaksa welcomed the consensual decision by the world body, which is in keeping with Sri Lanka?s ethical society where livelihoods are based on the teachings of the Buddha. He further observed that Buddhism has demonstrated to the world, that while anger and hatred are causes for sorrow, compassion and loving kindness is the path to contentment, with all divisions based on race, religion, caste and tribe being wholly meaningless. President Rajapaksa upheld that this significant achievement spearheaded by Sri Lanka on behalf of over 400 million Buddhists globally, will increase awareness of the teachings of the Buddha among the world community.
	?
	The current initiative builds upon the Resolution adopted in 1999 by the United Nations, which recognised the international observance of the Day of Vesak at the United Nations Headquarters and other UN offices.? The Resolution in 1999 was also an initiative of Sri Lanka.
	?
	Although Vesak has been observed at the UN since 1999, meetings have continued to be scheduled on that day each year. With the adoption of the current resolution, the scheduling of such meetings and events will be avoided, enabling the Observance of Vesak at the United Nations Headquarters and other offices to be held with wider participation and the sanctity it deserves.
	?
	Recognising other major religions observed by the world community, the General Assembly, in this instance also called on the UN to avoid scheduling meetings on Diwali, GurPurab, Orthodox Christmas and Yom Kippur.
	Quote: President Rajapaksa welcomed the consensual decision by the world body, which is in keeping with Sri Lanka?s ethical society where livelihoods are based on the teachings of the Buddha. He further observed that Buddhism has demonstrated to the world, that while anger and hatred are causes for sorrow, compassion and loving kindness is the path to contentment, with all divisions based on race, religion, caste and tribe being wholly meaningless.
