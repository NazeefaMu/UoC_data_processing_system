A creative ?Watercolour Exhibition?  by seven artists
	
?Beyond the Water Margin - Season 2?
?
The exhibition which commenced yesterday at the Lionel Wendt Art Gallery will continue on August 18, 19 & 20.? ?
Participating in the exhibition are seven contemporary Watercolour artists: Gunasiri Kolambage, Basil Cooray, Sanjeewee Senevirathna, Nilusha Weerakkody, Lalith Ranjan, Asanka Wijerathna & Sandatharaka Abeysingha.? ?
?Beyond the Water Margin - Season 2? Watercolour exhibition is organized by IWS Sri Lanka, the Sri Lankan branch of the International Watercolour Society (IWS). IWS country head Sanjeewee Senevirathna - a professional Watercolour artist commented on the collective effort, the exhibition and the medium.??
?
?Watercolour originated in 18th century England and then? spread throughout the world, making a characteristic sub-culture of its own. Exhibitions and contests, demonstrations and plein-air working, watercolour societies, workshops, watercolour museums, watercolour academies and conversations are the fields of the medium.? he noted.? ?
Clarifying a myth on watercolour, he said ?we generally accept that the watercolour originated from Europe but the truth is - the base of watercolour art was the Asian culture, mainly in China and Japan. The Chinese invented paper and the Japanese used water soluble ink to draw on the paper. The brushes they used were their traditional ?Calligraphy brushes? crafted with soft animal fur. The method was modernized in Europe and therefore two different major streams called Asian and European evolved. The watercolour style in Europe, Latin America and Australia is commonly known as European style while that in China, Japan, Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, Hongkong and Malaysia is known as the Asian style. The modern European style is established on identities borrowed from the Asian stream.? ?
?Marketing the product, meeting the requirements of art gallery owners, using expensive materials and pricing the artwork targeting a sale are among the problems for watercolour artists. Remaining as watercolour artists is a tough challenge we have undertaken.
Compared to other mediums such as oil paintings and acrylic, watercolour is not popular in Sri Lanka. It is widely known that watercolour is a difficult medium to handle since it cannot be revised once the brush stroke is applied; therefore the watercolour artist has to be precise in each brush stroke. An Indian watercolour artist Milind Mulick sums it up: ?Painting by watercolour is like shooting an arrow, once shot, it cannot be brought back?!? ?
?Marketing the product, meeting the requirements of art gallery owners, using expensive materials and pricing the artwork targeting a sale are among the problems for watercolour artists. Remaining as watercolour artists is a tough challenge we have undertaken. We had the passion to learn by ourselves and remained as we are despite the hardships. Art forms like these are restricted in the tight university structure; therefore even university students are not able to study watercolour at an academic level. Watercolour students must study international watercolour trends to fully understand how they have contributed in improving it while being creative and innovative,? Sanjeewee said.
?As artists, we believe in collective activities and efforts for the advancement of art. A group exhibition provides an array of experience to the art-loving public compared to a solo exhibition. ?Beyond the Water Margin? is a turning point since this is the first in watercolour history in Sri Lanka, where seven professional watercolour artists are participating in an exhibition,? he said.? ?
Explaining how the IWS impacts on the Sri Lankan watercolour art, Sanjeewee said his responsibility as the country head of IWS Sri Lanka was to connect local artists with the IWS and promote watercolour in Sri Lanka.
??Watercolour artists who are seeking opportunities to enter the international level, are encouraged by the IWS. Artists who have joined IWS participate at international competitions and exhibitions representing IWS Sri Lanka. Professional or amateur artists are allowed to join IWS Sri Lanka through the official Facebook page,? he said.? ?
This being a rare event, the IWS Sri Lanka invites art lovers to visit and see the beauty of watercolour art.? ? ?

An Appreciation to Beta Pereira An exceptional human being
	
At the very outset, let me say that it is not usual for a Son to write an appreciation of his mother ? but then my Mother was an exceptional human being ? at least to my two siblings Leilani and Pravin and my self. She lived to the ripe old age of 99 exceeding the Psalmist?s score by almost 3 decades! To the three of us, she was everything and more that a mother should be. Even long after my formative years, she was the one I turned to and rely upon. When I exceeded my weekly ?pocket money? allowance, I could rely on her for a little something to tide me over till the next instalment and nary a word to my Papa!. My Papa being the martinet he was, was very strict about what he ?doled out? to his three children. Come birthdays and family outings, it was our Mum who came out with the ideas and planning ?trips to Gampaha Gardens, Victoria Park, and moonlight dinners at the Lighthouse on Marine Drive! She was the one who always ensured that there was a ?Jolly Bomb? on my sister Leilani?s Birthday in December. Her culinary expertise was well known and my cousins still smack their lips when they talk about her Cheese Straws, Cream Buns and the Portuguese delicacy ?Bolo Folhado?, and the South Indian Payasam and Kesari. Her Sunday afternoon desserts were especially ?yummy? , and we the family could choose our favourite dessert in rotation ? my being ?Honeycomb Mould? pudding! Her skills extended to sewing , foreign languages and music as well. My Paternal aunt Niru used to tell us that she had sewn for four generations of my Father?s family. She quite adept at the keyboards and our home used to waft to the tunes of ?Chopsticks? and ?Maiden?s Prayer?.
Despite her mild disposition and dimunitive size, she could be quite formidable when the occasion warranted it and woe betide the butcher who ?short changed? her on a joint of beef or if the Dhoby brought back her precious ?Dorcas? bedsheets frayed! She was also a live wire at the Holy Family Convent Bambalapitiya, old girls association and played a good game of tennis in a (half-sari) at the Bambalapitiya Catholic Association. Mum had her share of idiosyncrasies too ? bent forks and knives, talking to herself whilst washing dishes at the Pantry sink etc! She also had this uncanny knack of getting along with people. In fact it was a standard joke at home, that when my Paternal Grandmother used to visit us at home, she spent more time with her daughter-in-law than with her son!!. Even at this advanced age of mine, what wouldn?t I give to be tucked into bed at night one more time listening to her narration of ?Jack and Bean Stalk? and lullabies like ?Kiss me goodnight Sergeant Major? and ?The Goodship Lollipop? and for a touch of those soft gnarled hands and that distinctive whiff of ?4711 Eau de Cologne? on her being, the rustle of her housecoat and that warm endearing smile.??
?She riseth with the dawn??
She eateth not the bread of idleness??
She opens her mouth with wisdom??
Her words are the law of kindliness??
Her children rise up and call her Blessed.???

Cases against Senarath and Kudabalage: The first to be heard by the Trial at Bar
	
The Special High Court Trial at Bar set up to hear cases of financial frauds and other major crimes will sit for the first time at Huftsdorp next Friday, a Colombo High Court source said yesterday.
The first case to be taken up by the three-judge bench of the Special Trial at Bar will be the case filed by the FCID against Gamini Senarath, who was former president Mahinda Rajapaksa's chief of staff and Piyadasa Kudabalage, the former chairman and managing director of the Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation (SLIC).
They are charged with misappropriating SLIC funds by investing millions of rupees in various ventures including the Grand Hyatt Hotel project using the investments of Grand Hyatt, Colombo.
Several senior state counsel from the Attorney General?s Department will appear for the prosecution while the respondents have retained a team of President's Counsel and senior lawyers.
The Trail at Bar comprises senior High Court judges Sampath Abeykoon, Sampath Wijeratne and Champa Janaki Rajaratne.
It will sit in the morning and in the afternoon to expedite the hearing. Two more similar High Courts are also in the pipeline to hear other major frauds and crimes which are alleged to have taken place during the past 10 years.
Commenting on the reason that led to the government setting up the special High Court at Bar, Justice Minister Talatha Athukorale told the Cabinet that though a circular had been issued to judges by the Judicial Service Commission (JSC) directing that trials of more than five years old to be held daily, it was observed more in the breach.
At the end of 2015, there were some 16,960, cases pending in the High Courts countrywide while the number of pending cases pending at the end of 2016 was 16,463, the number of pending cases as at September 2017 was 17,565.
The minister said laws delays have to be remedied resulting in an amendment to the Code of Criminal Procedure Act to make it mandatory to hold trials in the High courts, except in exceptional circumstances and for good reasons which have to be recorded.
Accordingly, the section 263 of the Criminal Procedure Code was amended to make daily mandatory. (Sandun A Jayasekera)

## Title: Death penalty is not the answer
## Section: Opinion
## Date: 18 August 2018 12:04 am
Death penalty is not the answer
	
It was reported that President Maithripala Sirisena?s proposal to implement the death penalty to drug traffickers, put to the Cabinet of Ministers last week was received with almost unanimous applause by the ministers. The sole exception was Finance and Mass Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera, who openly stated he was principally opposed to the death penalty.??
The death penalty can be considered as a pre-meditated and cold-blooded killing of a human being by the State, in the name of justice. It violates the right to life as proclaimed in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR).??
?
The death penalty can be seen as a pre-meditated and cold-blooded killing of a human being by the State in the name of justice
At the end of 2017, 106 countries (a majority of the world?s states) had abolished the death penalty in law for all crimes and 142 countries (more than two-thirds) had abolished the death penalty in law or practice. Most executions took place in China, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Pakistan ? in that order.??
Objectives of punishing criminals are three-fold: deterrence, retribution and rehabilitation. While death penalty, the ultimate cruel, inhuman, degrading punishment, does not result in retribution and rehabilitation, its supporters argue of its deterrent effect.??
The death penalty does not have a deterrent factor. It does not decrease crime. States with the death penalty in the USA do not have lower homicide rates. Nowhere has death penalty been shown to have any special powers to deter crime. On the contrary, it diverts attention from a real solution that is efficient, prompt and comprehensive crime investigation followed by quick and effective prosecution??
How many are sentenced to death in the United States for crimes they did not commit? The result of a new study released a few days ago believes the figure is 1 in every 25 (4%).??
There are many documented cases on innocent men and women being executed.??
One was that of Timothy Evans, who was executed in March 1950 in England for murdering a woman. Three years later, another man, John Christie, admitted responsibility for killing six women, including the woman that Evans purportedly killed!??
In February 1994, authorities in Russia executed serial killer Andrei Chikatilo for the highly publicised murders of 52 people. The authorities acknowledged that they had previously executed the ?wrong man,? Alexander Kravchenko, for one of the murders in their desire ?to stop the killings quickly.???
It has been documented that in a period of 10 years, the DNA profiling tests have provided stone-cold proof that 69 people who were sent to prison and death row in the US did not commit the alleged crime!??
?
It is well-known that our criminal justice system is heavily weighed against the poor and the disadvantaged, who do not have the capacity, knowledge and resources to search for evidence?
?
History shows that in Sri Lanka, over a long period of time repugnance at the death penalty has been felt and expressed by individuals of varying political colours, and is a matter that should and can be taken out of party politics.??
Attempts to abolish the death penalty in Sri Lanka commenced before independence.??
As early as in 1928, the Legislative Council adopted a resolution moved by D.S. Senanayake that capital punishment should be abolished. Similar resolutions to this effect were thereafter at various times proposed by Hon. Susantha de Fonseka of Panadura, Hon. Dr. A.P. de Zoysa of Colombo South, and Hon. Fred E. de Silva of Kandy. All these attempts failed.??
The most serious attempt to abolish the death penalty was made as a result of a decision of the. The ?Suspension of Capital Punishment Act? brought at the very first Cabinet meeting of the government of S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike in 1956, suspended the death penalty for a three-year period. However, after his assassination, the caretaker government headed by W. Dahanayake repealed the Act. Executions resumed, but felt into disuse again after 1976 as presidential pardons were given by successive Presidents from 1977.??
For a correct conviction, the police, judicial medical officers, the Department of Government Analyst, the lawyers prosecuting and defending, and a jury are responsible.??
The quality of some of our judgements, to say the least is unsatisfactory. This is not my opinion but the opinion of the Supreme Court stated in the Soysa vs. Arsecularatna case.??
It is well-known that our criminal justice system is heavily weighed against the poor and the disadvantaged, who do not have the capacity, knowledge and resources to search for evidence that would show their innocence, and who has less access to competent and experienced lawyers. Therefore, they are the most likely victims of miscarriages of justice.??
All-Ceylon cricketer Mahadeva Sathasivam would have been hanged, if he could not afford to retain Dr. Colvin R. de Silva and get down Professor Sydney Smith, Professor of Forensic Medicine, University of Edinburgh, to support the crucial medical evidence of Professor G. S. W. de Saram, the first Professor of Forensic Medicine of the University of Colombo.??
Dr. Daymon Kularatna, who was charged for the murder of his wife, would have been hanged if he did not have resources to retain Mr. G. G. Ponnambalam and Dr. Colvin R. de Silva to defend him. In fact, the High Court originally convicted Dr. Kularatna.??
I consider, based on scientific and circumstantial evidence, both were innocent. What is the plight of a poor, uneducated villager who is accused of murder who cannot afford competent defence lawyers???
We have to consider the problems faced by the police in crime investigations and they should be solved. Some of them are: Inadequate human and material resources, insufficient training, inadequate medical and scientific support services, insufficient time to investigate crime, politicization of police, influence and bribery.??
The debate for or death penalty should not be opened. It should never open. Rather than justifying the death penalty, Sri Lanka should abolish the death penalty - NOW.??
The only leader who praised President Sirisena for attempting to replicate his country?s ?successful? war on drugs is Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte, who, the Human Rights Watch claim that at least 12,000 were killed as of January 2018. The Archbishop of Colombo Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith has also lauded the President?s decision to restore the death penalty.??
However, the Anglican Church of Ceylon has taken exception to the government?s decision to resume judicial executions of repeat drug offenders. A joint statement issued by the Bishops of Colombo and Kurunegala stated, ?The Church of Ceylon (Anglican Church) cannot, in any way, agree with the move????
?Sri Lanka is a signatory to the Second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, in 1989. The Protocol says, ?Each State Party shall take all necessary measures to abolish the death penalty within its jurisdiction.???
Although the death penalty is in our statute books, we have not implemented it since 1976. Presidents J. R. Jayewardene, Ranasinghe Premadasa, D. B. Wijethunga, Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga and Mahinda Rajapaksa quite correctly did not implement the death penalty. I am certain that President Sirisena would not execute any prisoner.? ?
Dr. Colvin R de Silva once observed that the simple fact that the death penalty was irreversible was in itself a sufficient reason for its abolition.??
I wish to conclude this article by what Dr. Colvin R. de Silva said during the Parliamentary debate to abolish the death penalty in 1956. He said, ?Of all things that the State may take away from man there is one thing which if you take away you cannot only not return but you can never compensate him for, that is his life.?
You may put a man in prison and deprive his liberty. You cannot, of course, return him the days he was in prison, but you may in some degree compensate him in other ways for the wrong that is recognized to have been done when you locked him away.?
But if you take his life, you may compensate his dependents and his relatives but never, can you give him anything adequate or inadequate, to replace that which was taken from him, once you are dead you may never be brought to life again.???

Dozens killed in ?shoot first? Asian Games crackdown: Amnesty

JAKARTA AFP Aug17, 2018-A police crackdown on petty crime in the run-up to the Asian Games in Indonesia has claimed dozens of lives, Amnesty International said Friday, criticising what it said was an ?unnecessary and excessive? campaign.? ?
The rights group said at least 31 suspects were killed under a ?shoot first and ask questions later? operation in host city Jakarta and South Sumatra in the lead-up to the world?s second-biggest multi-sport event, which kicks off Saturday.? ?
??These shocking figures reveal a clear pattern of unnecessary and excessive use of force,? said Usman Hamid, executive director of Amnesty?s Indonesia office.? ?
??The hosting of an international sporting event must not come at the price of abandoning human rights.?? ?
Police did not immediately respond to a request for comment.? ?
Last month, authorities said they had shot over 50 suspects in Jakarta who ?resisted arrest? during a pre-Games crackdown, with some 15 of them dying of their wounds.??

How human are we; to our own selves, let us be true - EDITORIAL
	
As human beings, our humanity is often measured by our care for others, and how we respond to a crisis such as a war, a major internal conflict or a lesser issue like a road tragedy, a fire in a building or a robbery involving our neighbour. Do we often run away from such a crisis or do we run into it in a bid to rescue or help others in some way. To the extent we get involved in helping others in a crisis and act like the Good Samaritan; to that extent will our humanity be measured. Those who run into a crisis to help others are also described as first responders and are regarded as unsung heroes.? ?
Each year on August 19, that is tomorrow the world pays tribute to the humanitarians who deliver aid to vulnerable communities in some of the most dangerous crises on the planet. Some of them make the ultimate sacrifice.??
?It is unconscionable that civilians and the aid workers who are trying to help them are killed or maimed in conflict zones with utter impunity,? said Mark Lowcock, United Nation Emergency Relief Coordinator and Humanitarian Affairs chief.??
Overall last year, 139 aid workers were killed, 102 wounded and 72 kidnapped in the line of duty, marking the fifth consecutive year in which more than 100 humanitarians lost their lives on the job. Moreover, it is the highest recorded annual death toll since 2013, when 156 humanitarians?
were killed.??
Also last year, of the 42,972 people reportedly killed or injured by explosive weapons, three out of every four victims were civilians ? a 38 per cent increase on the previous year. This needs to end,? Mr. Lowcock said.??
UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres noted in his Protection of Civilians report published in May, that attacks in just six conflict-affected countries were responsible for more than 26,000 civilian deaths or injuries. He emphasized that to reverse such high numbers of civilian casualties, required sustained advocacy.? ?
In addition to ensuring safe, unimpeded passage of supplies, Governments and non-State military groups are legally obliged to protect civilians and aid workers in armed conflicts.??
?It is imperative that we hold men with guns and power accountable when civilians and aid workers are illegally targeted,? Mr. Lowcock said.?
For World Humanitarian Day last year, more than two million people around the world participated in an online #NotATarget campaign, to push for change by telling stories of civilians in war and conflict areas. Building on that success, this year the UN and humanitarian partners have launched a ?living petition,? calling on world leaders to better protect civilians and aid workers. Global citizens are asked to ?sign? the petition with their selfies through a custom website that transforms their two-dimension photos into 3-D portraits of solidarity. Their faces are part of an installation at UN Headquarters, and will remain in place throughout the General Assembly, which begins on September 18.??
?The thousands of faces that make up the living petition will be on display to remind world leaders of their legal obligation to protect civilians in conflict,? Mr. Lowcock said. We hope many Sri Lankans will cooperate in this campaign.? ?
In 2008, the General Assembly designated August 19 as World Humanitarian Day to raise awareness of humanitarian assistance and pay tribute to the people who risk their lives to provide it.??
In Sri Lanka, there were two youth uprisings in 1971 and 1987 in addition to the devastating 26-year civil war in which tens of thousands were killed or injured. World Humanitarian Day is an appropriate time to reflect on how we reacted or responded when there were bomb attacks and other tragedies.
Did we run away or did we run into the crisis area to rescue or help others in some way. If our reaction was to run away, this is the time to search our conscience and see how human we are, whatever our religion or race maybe. Let our conscience be our guide, and as Shakespeare said in Hamlet, ?To thine own self be true, and it must follow, as the night the day, thou can not then be false to any person.???

IGP asks police in North to build houses for people there
	
The police officers stationed in the North are reportedly nonplussed and at a loss as to how they are to carry out the orders issued by Police Chief Pujith Jayasundara they should at least build one house each to be donated to people in the area.
Northern Province Senior DIG Roshan Fernando has taken initiative to instruct the police personnel under his command about request made by the IGP.
Already, housing construction has been undertaken in most areas of the country for the benefit of needy people. At the moment, 13 houses have been constructed in the area coming under the Vavuniya Police Division and 12 in the Mannar Police Division.
The Kilinochchi Police Division has constructed one house and the Mullaitivu Division another. The Northern Province DIG has expressed displeasure that no such work has been undertaken by the Police Divisions in Jaffna and Kankesanthurai.
All the 53 police stations have been ordered to complete at least one house each before December 31, 2018.
However, police sources in the North said they were in a dilemma as to how money could be raised to implement such housing projects. They said this could even lead police officers to solicit bribes from unlawful business operators such as timber racketeers and sand miners to build houses within the stipulated time.(Kelum Bandara)

Imran Khan sworn in as Pakistan prime minister
	
Former cricketer Imran Khan has been sworn-in as the new prime minister of Pakistan, more than two decades after he entered politics.
He was elected prime minister in a vote at the country's National Assembly on Friday.
His PTI party won the most seats in July's elections and Mr Khan has become PM with the help of small parties.
Correspondents say his priority will be to address a financial crisis, with the economy in need of a huge bailout.
On Saturday morning, Mr Khan was tearful and smiled as he stumbled over some of the words of his oath, led by the country's President Mamnoon Hussain.
Members of the 1992 cricket World Cup winning team that Mr Khan captained to victory watched the ceremony alongside senior PTI figures and military officials.
In Friday's vote, Mr Khan was backed by 176 members. His opponent, Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) president Shahbaz Sharif, received 96 votes.
In a speech to parliament, 65-year-old Mr Khan reiterated his campaign promise to hold "corrupt" politicians to account, and to improve opportunities for young people.
"First of all, we will start strict accountability. I promise to my God that everyone who looted this country will be made accountable," he said.
"I did not climb on any dictator's shoulders; I reached this place after struggling for 22 years.(BBC)

Open economy destroyed Lankan values: Cardinal
	
The open economy has destroyed the social norms and values practiced by the people of this country, Colombo's Archbishop Malcolm Cardinal Ranjith said.
He said this at the festive mass of Our Lady of Madu earlier this week.
?Open economy has destroyed this country?s culture norms and values especially among parents. Children were given the foremost place in our country. However the open economy has destroyed this because both parents have to work to support a family," the Cardinal said. ?Women go to work leaving their children with others. They have to work because the cost of living is high. However if one brings children into this world they should be looked after and should be brought up in a proper manner. If your child goes astray the money you earn by working go waste. Children should be brought up with good values. Late Pope Jahn Paul in hi encyclical on labour said a salary should be paid to non working mothers who stay at home to look after their children. This will encourage them and will help them to realize the importance of the hard work they do to bring up children. If not the money a working father and mother earn will go waste.?
He said Pope Francis in his encyclical on the family said the period when a mother bears her child within her is a most important and valuable time of her life and await child birth with eager anticipation.
"They consider motherhood as a blessing. Today many mothers do not want to give birth to children. They abandon their children and their childhood is taken away from them. We are living in a society where children are rejected. No one knows that their next child is going to bring great blessings,?
However children are being rejected continuously. At the same time we curse god when we lose these blessings. Some countries give great emphasis to children?s rights. Elaborate statements are made on children?s rights. However the rejecting children have become a norm in most of these countries. The societies today goes beyond legalizing abortion and even reject children who are already born,? the Cardinal said.

SL underworld nesting in universities: Wijeyadasa
	
Sri Lanka's underworld is nowhere else but in universities, Higher Education and Cultural Affairs Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe said yesterday.
He told a news briefing that the masterminds of the underworld were inside the universities controlling the entire university system.
?It is because of a few students that the entire university system is in jeopardy. A few students take the initiative in organizing the protests which ultimately have no results. Much of the protest marches are not carried out with the intention of meting out justice but to fulfil the political agendas of bankrupt politicians,? he added.
?The Government spends about Rs.500,000 on a university student,? the minister said.
He said the prevailing crisis in the university was not the result of a failure in administration but in the ideology of a few university students who are motivated by politically-minded students.
Meanwhile, the minister said ragging had become a huge issue in the universities where a lot of students had been inconvenienced and even led to students having to forgo their university education.
?We hope to carry out stringent action on ragging under the Ragging Act,? he said.
He said a 24-hour phone line was available - 011 2123700 to lodge complaints by anybody who fell victim to ragging. (Sheain Fernandopulle)

Sri Lanka Uni Women?s Federation Programmes to motivate undergraduates
	
The Sri Lanka Federation of University Women?
( SLFUW) is striving to open the eyes of university students to ideas, opportunities and possibilities beyond what they may know, by conducting a series of motivation and mentoring programmes in local universities.??
When undergraduates hear stories of great achievers in their own words they are more likely to take it seriously, do better academically and behaviourally, and graduate from universities with great expectations.??
?
With this intention of motivating university students towards? the SLFUW with a long history of nearly 77 years has been organizing a special programme titled ?Surmounting Mountain as metaphor? with the aim of empowering youth to achieve their goals

With this intention of motivating university students towards? the SLFUW with a long history of nearly 77 years has been organizing a special programme titled ?Surmounting Mountain as metaphor? with the aim of empowering youth to achieve their goals.??
Jaffna university students will get a chance to hear the inspirational story of? Sri Lanka?s Everest Climbers Jayanti Kuru-Utumpala and Johann Peiris as another presentation of this programme on Sunday 19.??
The event coordinators are Iranganie Bopearachchi and Delaine Weerakkody with Dr. Nirmali de Silva at the helm, while the SLFUW will be organizing the event at the Jaffna University.??

## Title: The big American mistakes with Russia

The big American mistakes with Russia
	
?
Two mistakes, committed on President Barack Obama?s watch, were the triggers for the end of the long post-Cold War period of good relations with Russia. They were the attack on Libya by the US, France and the UK and the subsequent killing of its long-time dictator, Muammar Gadhafi. The second was the crisis in Ukraine.??
Russia was very angry about the first. Having been persuaded by Western diplomacy that the reason for their would-be intervention was essentially humanitarian to forestall any more mass killing in the Libyan civil war, the US and Nato double-crossed Russia. After having gained Russia?s abstention in a UN Security Council vote on a resolution authorizing military intervention the Western powers set about hunting Gadhafi.? ?
?
As Zbigniew Brezinski, a pre-eminent foreign policy advisor to? presidents, told me, if George H.W. Bush had not been replaced by Bill? Clinton these bad mistakes would not have been made and Russia probably? would be firmly attached to the West
?
With the second, Ukraine, Russia felt undermined. This was the result of the twin policies of Nato expansion up to Russia?s border-which the US, Germany, France and the UK had promised would never happen- and EU enlargement. Nato declared that Ukraine would be a Nato member. For its part the EU had pushed too early and too hard for an association agreement with the corrupt government of President Viktor Yanukovych. When demonstrations erupted in Kiev the US and the EU lent support and assistance to revolutionary elements and to endorsing a clearly illegal oligarch-ultranationalist revolt in February 2014, despite an agreement made by some of the European powers and Russia that essentially ensured Yanukovych?s departure from the presidency in ten months? time.? ?
Obama has confessed that Libya was his biggest foreign policy mistake. At least it helped lead him not to try and do the same thing in Syria.??
But there are no mea culpas over Ukraine. The crisis continues into a fifth year with no end in site. The West appears to have ignored President Vladimir Putin?s suggestion of the deployment of a UN peacekeeping force in eastern Ukraine.? Gone are the fashioning of benign policies America created before- a new nuclear arms reduction treaty, agreeing at the UN to impose tough sanctions on Iran, which led to the denuclearization accord, jointly negotiated, managing Russia?s entry into the World Trade Organisation, the coordinated action to defuse violence in Kyrgyzstan, and Russia supplying engines for the US?s space rockets. There was also a vast expansion of the network used to transport American soldiers and supplies across Russia to Afghanistan.??

?
?
Under Obama the spirit of cooperation had nearly all gone. But President Donald Trump wants to bring the era of goodwill back again. Unfortunately, because of his erratic leadership, no one is quite sure whether to trust him. Moreover, he says one thing about friendship with Russia while his Administration increases sanctions and does a go-slow on arms control. This leads to wondering who?s in charge. Is it the so-called Blob, i.e. the senior people in the National Security Council, the State Department, the CIA and the Pentagon who seem to be able, together with their allies in the press and academia, to out-fox their commander in chief???
It?s hard to believe that not very long ago Putin was entertaining the possibility of joining Nato. As Zbigniew Brezinski, a pre-eminent foreign policy advisor to presidents, told me, if George H.W. Bush had not been replaced by Bill Clinton these bad mistakes would not have been made and Russia probably would be firmly attached to the West.??
An influential member of the Blob is Obama?s ambassador to Moscow, Michael McFaul. In a new book, ?From Cold War to Hot Peace?, he pulls Putin to pieces. Although he confesses that before he joined the Administration he knew not much about the history of Russia nor about Cold War interactions with the country, he engaged in a campaign to persuade Obama to take a hard line with Putin.??
The book is extremely one-sided. There are important omissions, such as Obama?s confession over the Libyan imbroglio. The Russian media is presented as monolithic and in Putin?s pocket. In fact in Russia if you want to know a different point of view, including Western ones, there are a couple of TV stations, a radio station and an up-market newspaper, all with nation-wide reach, who will give it to you. Russian bookshops have everything. The universities are fairly open-minded. The internet has free, uncontrolled, access. McFaul doesn?t mention that Obama didn?t have on his staff people who were knowledgeable enough to argue a counter point of view, for example the Harvard professor of international affairs, Stephen Walt, whose own book, ?The Hell of Good Intentions? which will be published in October, provides that. Walt argues that ?Few states have caused more harm to others in recent years that the US has, but not very many.? Finally, McFaul gives no space to the arguments of those who advocated staying friendly and engaged with Russia, whatever happened.??
Let?s hope Trump means what he says about making Russia a friend again.??

The 3D?s  Development, Devolution and District Councils
	
To my mind this is the brightest spark that appears in the midst of such confused, convoluted and shallow thinking. This strategy can lead to a new dawn that will demolish the narrow ethnic, religious and other man-made distinctions
With a taste for the subject, I continued to have an abiding interest in the functioning of the District Ministry system?
?
This article reflects on an important news item that appeared recently referring to the move made by the State Minister of Foreign Affairs, Wasantha Senanayake, to revive the now defunct District Councils.??
To my mind this is the brightest spark that appears in the midst of such confused, convoluted and shallow thinking. This strategy can lead to a new dawn that will demolish the narrow ethnic and religious as well as other man-made distinctions and bring about a balanced equitable and Sustainable Development throughout the length and breadth of this small country blessed with such a rich diversity of cultures.??
What follows below first appeared in the newspapers on September 28, 2005, under the headline ?Preserving the Unitary Status of Sri Lanka? and is included in the volume of collected articles by this author entitled ?Prophetic Indictments ? The failed Neo-Liberal Paradigm of Economics, Politics, Governance, Society and Science in Sri Lanka and Globally? (2018, Tulana Jubilee Publications, now available at Vijitha Yapa, Godage, and Barefoot bookshops)??
Preserving the Unitary Status of Sri Lanka??
One of the most stupid statements I have heard in living memory was that made by a learned academic at a seminar held to discuss The World Bank?s ?World Development Report, 2005?. Unless the wiring in my auditory system is faulty, I heard him on TV asking the question from a spell-bound audience, more non-nationals than locals, ??Do you think any development is possible in a state with a unitary character ? Answering that question himself, he emphatically and sternly said, ?I Say No?. No one in that audience including the directors- General of National planning asked for an elaboration of that dogmatic assertion nor do I want to, because, I wish to leave such stupid ideas of development with that speaker and all who may be agreeing with him, My purpose as a student of the socioeconomics of poor Third World countries, and of course our own Sri Lanka, is to congratulate the Leader of the United National Party on resurrecting the District Ministry System. And suggesting some strategically important changes. Derived from my own field experience, if the goal of good results is anticipated.? ?
In 1977, when the United National Party took office, the President and Minister of plan implementation appointed Dr. Wickrema Weerasooriya as the Secretary. He arrived from Australia with a missionary?s zeal and set out to make the government he supported a great success. Naturally, when the new idea of District Level Development at a greater pace emerged, he was entrusted with the task of pursuing the concept, Dr. Weerasooriya named me as the Secretary of the committee which consisted of relevant Ministry secretaries with the cabinet secretary G.V.P. Samarasighe, as chairman. After, I prepared two papers and attended two or three meeting , the subject slipped out of my hands and perhaps, of the Secretary?s as well.? ?
?
One of the most stupid statements I have heard in living memory was that made by a learned academic at a seminar held to discuss The World Bank?s ?World Development Report, 2005?
?
With a taste for the subject and its implications, I continued to have an abiding interest in the functioning of the District Ministry system when it finally came into existence. In my view in spite of all its weaknesses stoked by the cancer of politicization for a small country.,25,000 square miles in extent, the District is the most viable unit of economic development. With my experience as a public servant in the Ministry of Plan Implementation and as a parliamentarian , I have no double that the District provides optimally for integrated sub-national level development including delivery of various governmental services of the community as well as services which local bodies and village level organizations provide. The District together with all sub-national and sub-district level units is closer to the people, who matter the most, is accountable to the local community and is responsible for making policy and its administration.? ?
Now, the main problem hindering the working of the District Ministry system is the plain fact that the Minister concerned does not enjoy political power in proportion to the responsibilities thrust on him. Time and again I observed that the Minister spends (wastes) much of his time seeking the approval of Line Ministers away in Colombo, much like the Provincial Council Ministers of today.? ?
The remedy for this predicament had been canvassed by a senior retired public servant, W.S. Wewegama. At various public fora, with full support from the author, he suggested that the District Minister should have the rank of a Cabinet Minister for the smooth, efficient, productive, application of development strategies and policies. To this end:? ?
i. The members of parliament who obtain the highest number of preferential votes should be made the District Minster of the relevant District.? ?
ii. The District Minister should enjoy Cabinet status.??
iii. The District Minister as a member of the cabinet gets an opportunity to obtain quick decisions from his colleagues who handle Line Ministries , and, further he in turn could monitor and provide first hand information on urgent bottle necks relating to the performance of the different Line Ministry subjects.? ?
As a concerned citizen, I believe that such an arrangement will be a giant step forward and a just and fair horizontal economic development , particularly, if economic development is for the benefit of the many and not the few as it now goes : and, notwithstanding the Cassandra talk of that learned academic, Sri Lanka can forge a development plan at an accelerated rate, uniformly, throughout the country under such a system, while retaining its unitary character.

Turkish, Iranian economic crises may affect SL: PM
	
Fresh moves by the United States to impose sanctions on Turkey and the impending economic crisis in Iran may affect Sri Lanka as well, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said yesterday.
He said this at the opening of the Deviduragama Udagama in Moneragala.
?Economic crises in Turkey and Iran may affect Sri Lanka and as such we should be prepared to face any such calamity,? the Prime Minister said while referring to the foreign media reports that the US will impose sanctions on Turkey shortly and the warnings given by the international economic experts that Iranian was on the verge of an economic crisis.
However, the Prime Minister was optimistic that Sri Lanka would resolve its debt crisis by 2025. ?Government revenue was hardly sufficient to meet debt servicing when this government took over in 2015 but now debt servicing had dropped to 70 per cent of the GDP. We hope to bring it down to between 60 and 55 per cent of the GDP by 2025,? he said.
"The previous regime decided to hold elections because it could not manage debt servicing. ?It may have thought that Sri Lanka would become another Greece. The opposition also thought that this government will be caught up in a crisis. However we have managed to steady the economy despite difficulties. We had no choice but to go for a standby arrangement with the IMF but we have steadied the economy now,? he said. (Yohan Perera)
