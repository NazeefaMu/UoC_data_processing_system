A JUMBO CONFLICT
	
There is an ancient linkage between man and elephant. No other animal like the elephant has had such a close relationship with the people of Sri Lanka. Elephants were caught, tamed and used in numbers for large scale and massive construction work. However, today, people aren?t? connected with jumbos as muchand get irritated when they hear the word ?elephant?. It?s absolutely essential to analyse as to why the association between elephants and humans eventually became negative. 
?
?
Elephants, being the largest terrestrial herbivores, require relatively larger areas and diversity of environments to survive. However, with the increase in the human population and changes in pattern regarding land-use, the elephant habitat is being reduced. Consequently, the majority of the present day jumbos have got used to encroaching into the human habitats, which has resulted in a conflict with humans.
These elephants cause vast damage to agriculture, properties and even bring death to humans. It is unfair to palm the blame on both the elephants? and the humans in this regard. What is required is to find pertinent solutions to put an end to this Human-Elephant Conflicts (HEC). This conflict has created a vicious cycle of violence.
Between 50 -80 humans and between 150 -200 elephants are killed annually due to the HEC.
Even President Maithripala Sirisena has raised concerns in this regard and said that this is an issue that demands an effective solution. ?
Jumbos in Sri Lanka
One-hundred years ago, more than 20,000 wild Asian elephants inhabited Sri Lanka. Today, elephants are restricted to the lowlands, especially the Dry Zone. The Department of Wildlife Conservation? recognises? that? about 70%? of? the? elephant?s? range? lies? outside? the system of national parks and nature reserves.
The number of elephants in Sri Lanka today is but a fraction of what existed about 100 years ago. Different figures were given by different people regarding the number of wild elephants.
According to an expert on elephant and biodiversity, Elephant Conservation Trust Chairman Jayantha Jayewardene the population of elephants today numbers 5,000-5,700.
Speaking to the Daily Mirror, he said that the Asian elephant should be a protected animal as it is categorised as ?Endangered? in the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List.
Elephant habitats ?
With the habitats of elephants are reduced they result in their population being broken up.? Some herds have got pocketed in small patches of jungle. With their movements restricted, especially when food and water resources are depleted, elephants wander into new cultivated areas, which were their former habitat, in search of food.? When this happens, it creates conflicts between
humans and elephants.
The human-elephant conflict is one of the biggest environmental and socio-economic crises of rural Sri Lanka.
The conflict has escalated in the recent past. During the past 12 years alone, a total of 1,464 elephants were killed while 672 humans became victims of elephant attacks.Deputy Minister of Sustainable Development, Wildlife and Regional Development Palitha Thewarapperuma said that the HEC initially started due to people putting up dwelling in the places which originally were owned by elephants and other animals.
?Those environmentalists, who make accusations saying that the authorities have not taken adequate steps to find remedies to this conflict, have not recognised the nature of this issue and have no knowledge of the gravity of it,? Thewarapperuma argued.
Meanwhile, Jayewardene said that the electrical fence was not an effective method to prevent elephants from entering the human habitation.
?The elephants are wise beasts unlike other herbivorous animals. They are well aware as to how they should get rid of this fence. Therefore, what should be done is to dig a drain along the location of the electrical fences,? Jayewardene said.
?
What have the authorities done?
Thewarapperuma said that this was not an issue that could be resolved in a hurry and added that this problem has existed for 75 years.
?I presume that it would take another 10 or 15 years to sort out this conflict completely. However, we are very keen on this issue and still working on it to solve it,? added Thewarapperuma.
With this conflict intensifying, we have been witnesses to incidents involving jumbos where humans became victims. During such incidents the Government provided Rs. 500,000 as compensation to the victims? families and in addition to the Rs.50, 000 given to bear the funeral expenses.?? ?
The Department of Wildlife Conservation has been very positive in its efforts to resolve the HEC. It is at present adopting the following conservation measures:
?
?
?
	Elephant Deterrence ? the use of noise, flashes and other shock tactics to deter elephants
	
	
	Establishment of new National Parks and increasing the size of conservation areas.
	
	
	Establishment of elephant corridors ? to allow the safe passage of elephants from one habitat to another.
	
	
	Elephant habitats to be enriched to enhance carry capacity
	
	
	Translocation of elephants to less populated areas
	
	
	Electrical Fencing ? forming solid barriers between farmland and elephant habitat
	
	
	Ex-situ conservation and breeding programme
	
	
	Control poaching
	
	
	nSynergising elephant conservation with economic development.
	
?
"The organisations urged Wildlife minister in office Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka to look into this issue and take pertinent actions to suspend the proceedings of the proposed plane that would not be an effective tool to put an end to the HEC"
Plight of rural natives
The plight of the small and marginal farmers is miserable, as evident from reports relating to suicides. Many are in deep debt and are unable to move out of their poverty vortex.
?Their problems? are? compounded? by? wildlife, especially? the? elephant? whose? incursions? into their? farmlands? can? ruin ?
their? lives.
We have witnessed some heart-breaking incidents where children and adults were killed by elephants.
?It was reported that 94% of these victims received absolutely? no? compensation? at? all? from? the Government? for? their? losses? due? to? elephant depredations.? Only 6% received some compensation, but that too, according to them, was insignificant and
came too late.
Jayewardene said it was perhaps hard to estimate the damage done by the elephants to people?s properties.
?
Government policy not effective
Several groups comprising environmentalists said that the Elephant Conservation and mitigating the Human Elephant Conflict through a Government initiative was not practical.
Organisations like Centre for Conservation and Research, Centre for Environmental Justice, Elephant Forest and Environment Conservation Trust and Biodiversity and Elephant Conservation Trust etc, raised concerns over this unsuccessful move by the Government.
Issuing a special media release, Biodiversity Conservation and Research Circle President Supun Lahiru Prakash said that the plan had been introduced by the Ministry of Sustainable Development, Wildlife and Regional Development to solve the HECC completely within one and half years. ?According to the new programme, the troublesome elephants would be driven away to the forests reserves while rogue jumbos would be kept in detention centres,
It is in contravention to the National policy for the Conservation and Management of wild elephants. This would never help in finding solutions to the HEC and would rather worsen the HEC because it is so unrealistic and against scientific methods,? Lahiru Prakash said.
The organisations urged Wildlife minister in office Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka to look into this issue and take pertinent actions to suspend the proceedings of the proposed plane that would not be an effective tool to put an end to the HEC.? ?
?
What should be done?
Species Conservation Centre Chairperson Pubudu Weeraratne said that the conflict had arisen on account of the lack of National Land Use Policy in Sri Lanka.
National Land Use Policy is to prepare plans to rationally allocate the land resources among competing needs of the country. This guarantees the optimal and sustainable use of land while maintaining an environmental balance. ?The Government should first monitor the National Land Use Policy in a proper manner. Besides, it should make sure that the development projects are determined in a manner which would not damage the livelihood of the species,
The people living in elephants dwelling areas should not send cows to the jungle to eat grass because it would make the elephants come to the living areas of people in search of food? Weeraratne said.
Nevertheless, Jayewardene said that the Government should consult the experts of animals and get the necessary pieces of advice to address this issue.

A president who values happiness - EDITORIAL
	
?
he efforts taken by President Maithripala Sirisena to take development to the villages reminds us of the time of the Late President Ranasinghe Premadasa. President Sirisena was quoted in in newspapers recently saying that people are happy with the development programmes carried out in the hamlets.
His latest efforts in this type of endeavour was the building of a hostel for the priests at Hingurakdamana Kashyapa Pirivena under the ?Pibidemu Polonnaruwa Programme?.
Sirisena is from Pollonaruwa and it?s natural that he has a soft corner for this village. But with this type of programme he also kills two birds with one stone. In terms of obtaining millage for his efforts this programme takes the message to other villages that this country has a president whose vision in politics includes the villager.
When Colombo complains that this Yahapalana Government has done little for its citizens, this is the president?s way of telling his detractors that he knows where his priorities are. For the record as many as 180 development projects have been scheduled under the ?Pibidemu
Polonnaruwa Programme?.
What?s important in this development drive is that the present Government expects cooperation and advice for it from intellectuals, something that the Rajapaksa regime didn?t do or never fancied. It?s this attitude of the president wanting to keep the ends warm with the Colombo business community that gives hope that all are included in his plans in the country?s journey till 2020.
State Minister of Finance Eran Wickremaratne has said that most of the people who flock to the Finance Ministry are businessmen, hence their businesses need to be protected. This is an assurance that the private sector needs, especially when goods and services are heavily taxed. Wickremaratne was quoted in an interview with the Daily Mirror recently saying that the tax which people pay is 14%.
The president saying that people in the hamlets are happy has a catch. Happiness is one key indicator of how people are treated by their regime. This statement also conveys the message that happiness can?t be acquired through money. When the president declared open the Moragahkanda Reservoir in July this year he said that it was the happiest day of his life. Happiness is a vital key and supersedes all pleasures in life. When a politician brings this word to the minds of the people it tends to be a much talked about topic. Now we have to ask ourselves whether we are happy with the manner in which we have been ruled by this Government?
We have some sort of democracy now. Citizens are enjoying to the maximum one of the main characteristic of democracy which is civil liberties, under which comes the freedom of expression and speech. All this freedom however doesn?t mean much if people can?t afford three square healthy meals a day!
President Sirisena is a simple man; talks simple and dresses simple. He even declared his salary recently which amazingly is below six figures. And he also knows quite well that Colombo?s vociferous public has been grumbling about the cost of living shooting up to unbearable heights. However, Government allies still point out that fuel prices have not reached the figures which were present during the Rajapaksa regime.
Sirisena knows how to defuse a ?fire?. People were boiling with anger just a few days ago when they came to know that the perks of ministers were to be raised by over 200%. But he calmed an agitating nation by declaring his salary and also by promising not to increase the salaries of government ministers by even five cents.
Despite the present uncertainty that prevails over the Unity Government, Sirisena remembers to smile when he is under the spotlight. It?s a smile that for a moment reminds us of a choice that people can in the future make between having a president who loves peace or one who loves power.

## Title: AIA Insurance announces new brand promise to help Sri Lankans live healthier, longer, better lives.

AIA Insurance announces new brand promise to help Sri Lankans live healthier, longer, better lives.
	
AIA Insurance, having undertaken extensive research across Asia to understand how, in today?s world, AIA differentiates itself in a relevant and sustainable way, is proud to annouce a new brand promise; helping people live healthier, longer and better lives. Our goal is to help people to make the most of life. It?s not just about living life but about living life well- living life to the fullest.?
??And what does this mean for Sri Lanka?? asked AIA?s CEO Pankaj Banerjee; ?As an Insurer, AIA wants to step in to make a positive change to the way customers view insurance. We want to change the ?you die- we pay? model of insurance to ?we are here to help you live life to the fullest, with the people you love.? It is better for us as the insurer, it is better for the customer and ultimately, it is better for the community.??
Pankaj continued ?with a rapidly aging population, improving lifespans and more nuclear families the need for personal pensions has never been greater. As a responsible insurer, it is our role to educate people, help them plan and save so that our customers can indeed live life to the fullest in retirement. Another dimension of what?s happening in Sri Lanka is that as people get wealthier, they aren?t necessarily getting healthier!? We don?t exercise enough, smoke and drink too much alcohol and eat unhealthily!? And as we?re living longer, the chances of us needing medical care only increase. In fact, 75% of deaths are due to non-communicable diseases (NCDs), which are steadily on the rise. Again, this is a key area where AIA is stepping up to support Sri Lankans ? we?re ensuring that they are financially protected for any health eventuality ? so that they can afford the best care and bounce back from illness. Better still, we?re encouraging the overall wellness of Sri Lankans by motivating them to lead healthier lifestyles and rewarding them to do so?.
The importance of AIA?s mission was further validated by the findings of the annual AIA Healthy Living Index (HLI) survey which highlights prevailing health trends across Asia. The 2018 survey found that Sri Lanka is facing a critical illness ?finance gap? where savings, current levels of insurance and government health provisions may not be enough to pay for the treatment for critical illnesses (such as cancer, heart disease). 41% of respondents expressed their worry about having to financially cope with these serious illnesses.?
?So how can AIA help?? asked Deputy CEO Upul Wijesinghe; ?The cost of medical treatment is increasing. A brief hospitalisation for flu costs about Rs. 100,000, a bypass surgery about Rs. 750,000, a kidney transplant approximately Rs. 1.5 million and the cost of cancer treatment in an infinite amount.? With people living an average of 20 years after retiring, how can retirees ensure that they can sustain the lifestyle they are used to along with the inevitable medical bills, when there is no sustainable monthly income? 50% of retirees in Sri Lanka depend on their children but we can all agree that that?s not the ideal situation.?
?This is where our products can help? he said; ?AIA?s expertise is in health and pensions with options for everyone from all walks of life. Our flagship health product AIA Health Protector has been designed to help our customers focus on getting better and not have to worry about finances. It is currently the most comprehensive health cover available in the market and not only covers 37 critical illnesses, 250+ surgeries, hospital expenses but also allows Sri Lankan?s to secure the best medical treatment world-wide.?
?AIA Smart Pensions is another great example of how we?re ensuring a better life for the many Sri Lankans that trust their retirement savings with us. Packed with features, it is designed to maximise your savings when you are ready to retire. AIA Smart Pensions lets customers replace their monthly pay cheques with monthly pension cheques that then increase each month to fight against inflation. And it guarantees the pension to your beneficiaries even if you aren?t around.?
?AIA Vitality is another great example of how we help people live Healthier? said AIA Chief Marketing Officer Nikhil Advani; ?a science backed wellness programme that helps you make a real change to your life by rewarding you for being active. By doing so we hope to motivate people to get active, fit and healthy.? Over 30,000 Sri Lankans are enrolled on AIA Vitality and it is immensely popular with corporate employees who AIA signs up through the ?corporate wellness days? it organizes across the country. The programme is free for anyone to join.
?Corporate wellness? is an important part of what we do because it ensures a healthy workforce which means happier, more productive employees. That is why we proactively conduct corporate wellness days where we engage employees to understand their health and show them how they can use Vitality to improve their health.??
AIA also announced ?The Healthiest Workplace Survey? in Sri Lanka for the first time - a comprehensive survey of the health and wellbeing of employees around Asia-Pacific. It builds on the success of Healthiest Workplace by AIA Vitality, which has surveyed employees and employers across several countries in Asia. On top of an overview of their lifestyle, clinical indicators, mental health, stress and other areas that may concern them, each participating employee will receive a personal report a subsequent recommendation for areas of improvement. 165 of Sri Lanka?s leading corporates have registered for this and the healthiest company will be recognized and awarded at an event later in the year.?

Allow independent commissions to work independently: MR
	
Former President and Kurunegala District MP Mahinda Rajapaksa said yesterday it was pointless increasing salaries of chairpersons and members of independent commissions if they were not allowed to function independently.
Raising a question during the debate on revising the emoluments and allowances of chairpersons and members of nine independent commissions, he said certain decisions taken by the police commission had been halted by the police chief.
Law and Order Minister Ranjith Maddumabandara urged Mr. Rajapaksa to reveal any instances where a decision taken by the police commission was not implemented.
Mr. Rajapaksa said the promotion recommended by the police commission to Palitha Siriwardana had been halted for a long time and asked that justice is meted out to him.
The subject minister said his promotion to the rank of the DIG was halted as there were two charge sheets against him and added that such a promotion was not possible according to the law.
Mr. Rajapaksa said it was unfair to submit charge sheets based on personal issues after the promotion was given and added that it could have been done earlier.
"If the decisions of the police commission could be changed by the IGP or higher officials of the police department, what is the use of such a commission," he asked and added that independent commissions take decisions based on some facts and that their decisions should be respected.
He said independent commissions should be given powers and allowed to function independently.
Minister Maddumabandara said he would look into the matter. (Ajith Siriwardana and Yohan Perera)

Boris Johnson to be investigated by the Tories
	
UK, (Daily Mail), 8 August 2018 -? ?
Boris Johnson will be investigated by the Tory Party over his controversial comments comparing women in burqas to letterboxes, it was today revealed.? ?
The ex Foreign Secretary sparked a storm of controversy and was condemned by many party colleagues after making the comments, but has refused to apologise.? ?
The row has raged for four days with many Tory Remainers using it to stick the knife into Mr Johnson - a leading Brexiteer - and say he is not fit for office.? ?
Tory sources said the investigation was triggered automatically after they received a string of complaints about his words, which critics say risk fuelling hate crime.? ?
The party will then decide whether to refer Mr Johnson to a panel to face a formal grilling over whether he did flout party rules.? ?
If they find him at fault then Theresa May can decide what punishment to give her former minister - and could even kick him out of the Tory Party.? ?

Can't free Rajiv Gandhi's killers: Indian Govt. tells SC
	
The seven assassination convicts of Rajiv Gandhi, who are jailed in Tamil Nadu cannot be released, the Indian government told the Supreme Court on Friday asserting that the case involves the assassination of a former Prime Minister, the NDTV said today.
The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) of India, which investigated the case, has opposed the release of the seven convicts, the court was told.
Tamil Nadu had been informed of the decision on April 18, the centre told the court. The seven convicts had been in jail for 27 years.
The court had asked the centre to decide and respond to Tamil Nadu's request to release them. A constitution bench of top Supreme Court judges had said in 2015 that the convicts cannot be released without the central government's consent.
The convicts, Perarivalan, Murugan, Santhan, Nalini Sriharan, Robert Pious, Jayakumar and Ravichandran, are serving life terms. Rajiv Gandhi was assassinated in 1991 by a woman operative of the LTTE, who greeted him at a rally in Sriperumbudur town with a bomb strapped to her chest.
In April, the Madras High Court rejected Nalini Sriharan's request for early release. Her death sentence had been commuted on the request of Congress leader Sonia, the wife of Rajiv Gandhi.
Another convict, Perarivalan, had requested that the case be reopened and his conviction be cancelled. The Supreme Court rejected it in March.
Perarivalan was convicted for supplying two nine-volt batteries for the belt-bomb. He was 19 when he was arrested weeks after the assassination. He told a court that he had no idea what the batteries were for.
Perarivalan spent 14 years in solitary confinement after being sentenced to hang. His death sentence was changed to life term by the Supreme Court in 2014.
Congress president Rahul Gandhi, the son of Rajiv Gandhi, had said he had no objection to Perarivalan's release, a Tamil film director, PA Ranjith, was quoted as saying recently.
In 2014, then Chief Minister J Jayalalithaa decided to release the convicts but the centre - the Congress-led government was in power - challenged her decision. The Supreme Court then said the state could not take such a decision without the centre's sanction, as the case was investigated by the CBI.

CB failed to probe People's Bank lending Rs.4bn to minister: Ravi
	
MP Ravi Karunanayake yesterday found fault with the supervision unit of the Central Bank for its alleged failure to probe on lending of Rs.4 bn by the People?s Bank to a Minister.
MP Karunanayake who made this allegation in Parliament last afternoon said the supervision unit of the CBSL should be questioned on its failure to probe into the lending of Rs. 4 bn to a minister and lending further Rs. 10 bn to one Jehan Amaratunga. Former Lankaputhra Bank Chairman Lasantha Gunawardene was sacked for approving few loans which was worth Rs. 100,000 each but one needs to find out as to how the Peoples Bank had lend Rs. 4 bn to a minister and lending of Rs. 10 bn to Jehan Amaratunga?? Karunanayake queried.
MP Karuanayake then took the officials of finance ministry to task by alleging that some of them are misleading Minister of Finance Mangala Samaraweera. He said these officers are trying to create a rift between the President and the Prime Minister.
?These officials in the Ministry of Finance were the ones who led the country to a negative economic growth in 2001. They were henchmen of former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga,? he said.
He said further that, what is needed today is to create an environment where VAT could be reduced to 10% or 9%. (Yohan Perera and Ajith Siriwardana)

Coca-Cola?s ?Give Back Life? clean-up drive at Kataragma nets 4000 Kgs of PET bottles
	
Coca-Cola Beverages Sri Lanka Ltd. (CCBSL) partnered with Eco-Spindles Pvt Ltd and the Kataragama Committee in a PET plastic bottle clean-up and recycling programme during the Kataragama Festival of July 2018.? Approximately 100,000 plastic bottles (approx.4,000 Kgs) were collected during the event. Utilizing advanced recycling technology, Eco-Spindles will transform the bottles into brooms and brushes. The Kataragama clean-up is part of CCBSL?s ?Give Back Life? commitment - an ambitious goal to help collect and recycle the equivalent of every bottle we sell in Sri Lanka.
The clean-up drive also raised awareness about the need for disposing litter in a responsible manner, and reusing or recycling as much as possible. The programme was championed by volunteers from the Kataragama Festival Committee, particularly the Environmental Society, from the recycler Eco-Spindles and Coca-Cola?s Matara Sales Team who oversee the area, all working side by side. Gloves and poly bags used during this clean-up and collection programme were recycled too.?
Priyankara Dissanayaka - Head of Sourcing at Eco-Spindles Pvt Ltd. further added, ?The importance of recycling needs to be visible which is why it?s important for all stakeholders and members of the community to come together to use this material to its fullest which benefits many more and the country as a whole. It is a great partnership to be able to work with Coca-Cola for the second year in a row alongside the Kataragama Festival Committee and other volunteers to preserve the nature of the Festival and its sacred grounds. We were able to successfully educate the pilgrims and collect a significant number of PET plastic bottles which can now be recycled, generating income and benefitting waste collection workers.??
Commenting on the initiative, Lakshan Madurasinghe - Country Public Affairs, Communication and Sustainability Manager of CCBSL said ?We are pleased with the efforts of our ?Give Back Life? clean-up programme at the Kataragama festival, for the second year in a row. It succeeded in raising awareness and empowering the community to be more conscious about litter and disposing of waste in a responsible manner. As a player in the beverage industry, we want to engage actively in ensuring waste does not unnecessarily end up in landfills but ensure to give it back life by reusing or recycling. We wish to thank all the volunteers who joined hands to make this clean-up and collection programme a success.?
In the second consecutive year of initiating a PET collection drive whilst educating the public, the Kataragama Festival Committee consisting of all local government authorities and stakeholders, supported the strong efforts to preserve this ancient, cultural and heritage site of Sri Lanka. Coca-Cola hopes, through engagement with large numbers of attendees at such nationally important events, that it will be able to spread the message swiftly and efficiently about the importance of PET plastic collection and recycling.?
?Give Back Life? continues to drive locally The Coca-Cola Company?s global ?World Without Waste? goal to help collect and recycle the equivalent of 100% of its packaging by 2030. This goal is the centerpiece of the Company?s new packaging vision in Sri Lanka.?

Doctors prove Medical Council should be scrapped
	
?
Last Monday, the GMOA leadership held a media briefing in Colombo, perhaps to tell the Government the present Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) should not be touched. They threatened; any move to restructure the SLMC would compel them to take trade union action immediately and without warning.
They would launch the most drastic strike action ever in Sri Lankan history, they said. Thanks to them, in the wake of their threats they qualified me by name to be a member of the SLMC.
Perhaps because I was asking for a total overhaul of the SLMC observing:
?In our culture of professional selfishness and arrogance, the SLMC to be left at the hands of the medical profession alone would be too dangerous to the health of the nation. The way out would be to include other professions as ?community? representations.
It has to provide provincial community representation as well, to make it a nationally
representative body.?
That was 01 year and 05 months ago in my article to DM on 03 March 2017, titled ?SLMC needs overhaul?.
Well aware of this serious distortion in the SL Medical Council and its incapability to honour the mandate of safeguarding the health of the people, Prof. Colvin Gunaratne refused to accept the post of President SLMC when offered after Prof. Carlo Fonseka?s term came to an end. His belated consent to accept the position and subsequent taking of office two months later was underlined with the offer to ?restructure the SLMC.?
?Nine months after, Prof. Gunaratne resigned from his post as President SLMC to tell the public at a media conference.
?
"The purpose of this Constitution must be to provide for the welfare of the general public. But as things are now, this process protects doctors and not the innocent civilians-Colvin"
??The purpose of this Constitution must be to provide for the welfare of the general public. But as things are now, this process protects doctors and not the innocent civilians.?.? He qualified this by saying the archaic Medical Ordinance under which the SLMC has been established, makes the SLMC ineffective in achieving its primary objective ? ensuring the welfare of the public of Sri Lanka.
What Prof Gunaratne calls ?a museum piece?, the Medical Act as it stands for now provides eight elected members directly by medical doctors. Another eight members as representatives of the Medical Faculty boards from State universities. This number would keep increasing with more medical faculties on the way.
Medical faculties in Sabaragamuwa and Wayamba universities were gazetted recently and there is every possibility of Moratuwa and Uva-Wellassa Universities getting medical faculties before long with 02 private member motions in Parliament. The number of Deans in the SLMC would go up to 12 then and the irritating difficulty Prof Gunaratne had with 65 per cent union representation would go up to 70 per cent. The role of these Medical Faculty Deans in the SLMC has been taken for granted as independent academics.
But they too represent a trade union as members of the ?Federation of Faculty of Medical Teachers? Associations? (FFMTA) which has all 08 FMTAs affiliated to it. They are elected by Faculty boards consisting of members of FMTAs. Their subordination to FFMTA decisions was more than evident in how they played with the SAITM issue every time it came up for discussion in the SLMC. Within universities, pressured by medical undergrads working with the politically guided Inter University Student Federation (IUSF) and also on their own political interests, the FMTAs took up an anti SAITM stand.
We thus had a situation in universities where teaching staff in medical faculties supported student agitations. That was clearly and firmly reflected in FFMTA statements issued against SAITM openly calling it:
?We the trade unions of the academic staff of State Medical Faculties?.? and its Convener Dr M.C. Weerasinghe publicly claiming he has 700 medical academics ?under his charge?.
The GMOA having directly elected four of its top leadership to the SLMC can elect another four of their choice if elections are held for existing vacancies. It is impossible for independent medical practitioners to contest against GMOA nominees when the GMOA leadership uses all its resources and their organisation?s muscle power to have control over the SLMC. The GMOA is publicly accused of bringing 50 bus loads of juniors to vote for their top 04 men who contested for SLMC membership.
They had young ?bullies? at the venue of elections throwing about their weight. The GMOA behaviour in the elections was more like low-grade politicians than professionals.
Interviewed on a popular TV channel last Monday night, Dr Padeniya was asked to comment on Prof. Gunaratne?s accusation that 16 members representing 02 trade unions make it impossible for SLMC to stick to its mandate in taking care of people?s health.
?
The Sri Lanka Medical Council should be reconstituted
?The SLMC needs to be revamped to free it from the grip of the GMOA mafia
Bluffing over the issue, he claimed though he was President of a trade union, he was also a practising medical specialist, covering work of the professor for Paediatrics for over 05 years at Rajarata University (this raises another issue on Rajarata medical Faculty standards) and therefore is competent to sit in the SLMC.
His professional biographical sketch provided for the 2017 SLMC elections, highlights his work as GMOA President from 2011 and his leadership role in student unions. ?As the president of the GMOA, he gave leadership to safeguard the rights of patients (sic) and medical professionals alike? the biographical sketch says, adding ?As a former president of Medical Students? Union of Colombo Medical Faculty and Vice-President of the University of Colombo Students? Union, he championed rights of medical and other university students and fought to safeguard the free education system.?
But there is hardly anything in his achievements or his contribution to health and medical services as a medical professional.
On that election, what he avoids saying and accepting is, he and his 03 GMOA colleagues contested as GMOA nominees and not as independent individuals. What he forgets is that he himself has told very plainly that he is responsible for his membership. So are the Deans who are first responsible to their Faculty and not to the people.
If I may go further, the Medical (Amendment) Act No.40 of 1998 allows only medical practitioners and one dental practitioner registered with the SLMC in constituting the SLMC.
Thus, even those appointed by the Minister of Health under the Act have to be medical practitioners making all 25 members from one single profession.
Irrespective of how they came to be in the SLMC, there is always a singular collective mindset that first consider what they would gain as a ?profession? before the ?people? and the ?country?.
The Act too allows for politicisation of the Medical Council with the Health Minister appointing its President and four other members. The past three years at least proved the SLMC was completely bogged down in a battle for professional interests led by the GMOA, backed by the FFMTA in controlling the entire health service. A control that allows the medical profession to have controlling access to high stakes in the growing and lucrative private health sector. The medical doctors thus prove the SLMC needs a total to revamp.
One that makes it more representative and would deny a single group or profession to dominate the SLMC.
On that, let me quote my 2017 March DM article in conclusion. On the Australian model, the summing up was. ?The Medical Board of Australia (MBA) in fact has Federal State Medical Boards supporting it. There?s federal representation brought through Federal-State boards. They have highly reputed professionals including community representation with seven women out of the 13 in the elected board.?
The Canadian council includes even medical student representation which we cannot afford to, given the anarchist, irresponsible politics in the IUSF. The working of the Canadian council was summed up as follows.
?The Medical Council of Canada (MCC) also has federal and provincial representation in a Council of 52 members. The public elects up to five members and the medical undergraduates through their Canadian Federation of Medical Students elect two representatives. The Council elects its Executive Board at its annual meeting for regular deliberations on routine matters.?
?
"They had young bullies at the venue of elections throwing about their weight"
The British General Medical Council (GMC) ??.has 12 elected members with six elected to represent the community, called ?lay members?. Lay members are not from the medical profession and represent other disciplines. Interestingly in the present GMC, all06 lay members are women (in 2017 February it was 05).? The core ingredients of the GMC strategy for 2018 to 2020 are (1) Supporting doctors in delivering good medical practice (2) Strengthening collaboration with regulatory partners across the health services (3) Strengthening relationship with the public and the profession (4) Meeting the changing needs of the health services across the four countries of the UK.
That says why the SLMC needs to be revamped to free it from the grip of the GMOA mafia. And giving them further control of the SLMC allows continued decay of our total healthcare service.
This from my previous article sums up all.
?They demand ?free? education to become medical doctors at the expense of taxpayers and then the right to continue ?selling? healthcare at prices they determine to the very taxpayers, who paid for their ?free? education.
They work for private medical care at the expense of free health.
It is therefore hard to believe and there is no necessity to believe the medical profession and the GMOA are interested in the health and wellbeing of the community and the people.?

?
These herds reportedly owned by a prominent political family in the South are freely roaming in the Maduru-oya often foraging on the crops of the cultivators.
A leading politico who visited the Maduru-oya area to see for himself the damage caused by the rampaging herds, had assured the cultivators that he would take necessary steps to drive away the cattle. Soon after vowing to rid the people of the new nuisance, the politico had turned to journos present and said: ?Don?t report that I am now after the former Lokka?s cattle!??

Food and arthritis
	
?
There seems to be a constant debate on what food does to our bones and joints. Various myths exist regarding health benefits of vitamins on bone growth and joint repair. I intend to elaborate further on how the latest research has cleared some of these myths. A healthy diet is needed to prevent joint disease and I will also give some suggestions on modifying meals in the following article. We spoke to Dr. Himantha Atukorale, MBBS(Colombo) MD, Consultant in Joint Disease, Rheumatology and Rehabilitation to educate our readers on food and arthritis.?
?
What does food do to our joints?
?First of all I should emphasise the importance of losing weight to protect the weight bearing joints. Obesity is now becoming a major problem among many patients I encounter. And weight gain goes hand in hand with hip, knee, ankle and foot pain. In a condition called osteoarthritis one of the first steps we should take is to loose a considerable amount of weight. As you might already be aware of, we take into account an indices called Body Mass Index (BMI) in weight management programmes? Dr. Atukorala explained. This is a simple calculation where weight in kilograms is divided by height in metres times two (the square value of height). Sri Lankans are meant to have an ideal BMI of less than 23 kg/m2 . It is therefore useful for arthritis patients to have low BMI?s.??
?
A diet rich in antioxidants and omega 3 fatty acids is proven through research to help joint disease. The best example is a Mediterranean diet. This has green leaves, salads, olives and oily fish.
I am a fan of dairy products. Milk has not only calcium, but Vitamin D. Vitamin D helps in absorbing calcium and is a regulator in bone construction
?
Another finding is about a healthy diet in arthritis to protect against heart disease, strokes and vascular diseases. Arthritis is considered as an independent risk factor in having strokes, heart and blood vessel diseases. Therefore a healthy diet is essential if you have arthritis.??
?A diet rich in antioxidants and omega 3 fatty acids is proven through research to help joint disease. The best example is a Mediterranean diet. This has green leaves, salads, olives and oily fish.??
I am a fan of dairy products. Milk has not only calcium, but Vitamin D. Vitamin D helps in absorbing calcium and is a regulator in bone construction. When patients complain that they do not have access to fresh milk I advise them to use curd. Curd is a concentrated source of milk and doesn?t contain added sugar? he added.??
?
Is weight reduction possible?
?This is a burning issue faced by many patients. Some prefer to avoid any form of discussion on weight reduction. I have a simple solution. Always try to calculate the amount of energy you ?Burn? per day. And limit your food intake to balance the energy expenditure? Dr. Atukorala said.? ?
Talking about carbohydrates, bakery food items are the main culprit for the present obesity issue. Unrefined carbohydrates are the proper thing. So in simple terms, avoid buns, pastries, cakes and eat legumes like cowpea, chickpea or green gram. The carbs in these are gradually absorbed so you won?t get that surge of sugar in the bloodstream. These have soluble fiber which lowers cholesterol levels. Legumes are rich in minerals as well.??
?
Oils and fats
Did you know that by cutting down the fat intake by 30 grams a day you tend to avoid 270 kilo calories? When fat/oil is eaten, unless you exercise, this gets deposited in your body.??
Saturated fat is a major ingredient of cakes, biscuits and pastries. It?s also the key component in vegetable oil (palm oil). Saturated fat is known to increase joint inflammation/ swelling. Therefore it is considered harmful to joints. ?Unfortunately in South Asian countries palm oil which is marketed as vegetable oil is rapidly becoming popular. One research reported that humans consumed an average 17 pounds (7.7 kg) of palm oil per person in 2015. I feel that palm oil intake is alarmingly high among Sri Lankans. Not just joint disease, palm oil can increase the risk of heart disease. Margarine made in Sri Lanka has palm oil as the key ingredient? the doctor added.??
Another important food ingredient we all should avoid is transfats. Food items like fast food (burgers, hot dogs), margarine, icing on the cakes and baked food have lots of trans fats. These are proven to increase the joint inflammation. USA recently banned unsafe food items that include trans fats. Therefore certain types of margarine aren?t sold there. Transfats also increase the risk of heart disease.??
?
Does Omega-3 reduce joint inflammation?
I will explain this in simple terms. In 1991 two researchers Cremmor and Robinson published evidence that omega 3 fatty acids are protective against joint inflammation. This was more evident in joint diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis and psoriatic arthritis.??
Some food items that contain omega 3 are oily fish ( Jack Mackerel , Sardine and Salmon), Rapeseed and Flaxseed Oils and Walnuts.? ?
Another ingredient called omega 6 also might cause problems in people with joint disease. Sunflower oil and corn oil have omega 6. These can increase inflammation of joints. Coconut oil has no known side effects to joint disease and therefore is considered safe in moderation.??
?
Fruits and vegetables
Fresh fruits and vegetables are rich in anti oxidants. These clear away free radicles which can harm our joint structure. So fruits and vegetables are good protecting agents for joint diseased patients. Remember to eat plenty of green leaves, vegetables and brightly colored fruit containing lots of anti-oxidants.??
?
Saturated fat is a major ingredient of cakes, biscuits and pastries. It?s also the key component in vegetable oil (palm oil). Saturated fat is known to increase joint inflammation/swelling. Therefore it is considered harmful to joints.?
?
Short note on Gout
Whenever I talk about food and joints, I am asked about Gout. So what is Gout and what does it do to our joints? Uric acid is a waste product that gathers within our bodies. This is usually pushed out through the kidneys. If someone produces excess uric acid, this tends to form crystals especially inside the kidneys or joints. When crystals gather inside the joints, they irritate the joint interior causing severe pain and swelling. We call this Gout. The same thing could happen inside the kidneys or the tubes called ureters which lead out of the kidneys. Then certain ?Uric acid stones/calculi? are formed similar to kidney stones.??
What precipitates Gout? In individuals who form excess uric acid episodes of fever, diarrhea and dehydration can cause an attack of Gout. When these patients eat lots of red meat, seafood containing uric acid ingredients or drink alcohol such as beer, they could experience an episode of Gout. If the Gouty joint swelling is seen over the 1st big toe of the foot we call it podagra.??
There are medications to be given during the initial attack. And some tablets such as Allopurinol is given later on to avoid future episodes of Gout. Patients who have severe kidney disease are also at risk of Gout as their kidneys do not push out uric acid as healthy?people do.? ?

A certain lady occupying a very high chair in a city council had many an eyebrow raised when she recently gave a new look to her official residence at a massive cost.

Despite this official residence being in a very good condition, the lady had got the floor and wall tiles of the bathrooms replaced and structural and interior d?cor changes done to suit her extravagant taste, they say.
When her officials frowned on her grand plans to give the place a new look, she had said: ?I wanted to make this residence look elegant and attractive for my successors. As for me, I have got a posh two-storied residence of my own in the city. In fact, I don?t need an official residence at all!?

JO to file legal action against S'pore-SL FTA
	
The joint opposition is planning to file legal action against the Singapore-Sri Lanka Free Trade Agreement (FTA), JO MP Bandula Gunawardene said today.
He told a media briefing held at the parliamentary complex that his party file papers at the Supreme Court and pointed out that the FTA was illegal because the government had embarked on waving tax and import duty on 3000 items.
?Government has claimed that a gazette notification containing a list of items for which tax and duty will be removed was issued, but such a document cannot be found. Therefore the FTA is illegal,? he said.
The MP said the items that are to be free of taxes under the FTA include animal sperm, elephants, tusks, fish species which are banned from being used as trade items, urethras and artifacts. ?In short the bio diversity of our country has been handed over to Singapore,? he said.
The MP said all professionals including doctors and nurses will join the JO for its protest campaign against the FTA next month.
MP Chandima Weerakody who also participated in the media briefing said Sri Lanka was also planning to sign free trade agreements with Thailand and Malaysia.
He claimed Sri Lanka was going to allow Thai nationals to enter the country without visas and that this was aimed at allowing young handsome Thai boys to come into Sri Lanka under a clause which is to be included in the FTA with Thailand following a personal request of a particular person.

Legitimate criticism of Israel is not anti-Semitism
	
hen Israel?s Parliament, the Knesset, in the wee hours of July 19 passed a controversial law, declaring that Israel was exclusively a Jewish state, the passage of the bill made headlines but failed to generate much worldwide condemnation.
In any other democracy, including the United States, a bid to enact similar legislation will draw widespread denunciation. The new Israeli law undermines human dignity and upholds the superiority of Jewish citizens over its other citizens. It has been given the enshrined status of a Basic Law, underlying the principles of the State. Therefore, it cannot easily be repealed.? The new law recognises ?Israel as the nation-state of the Jewish people? and reduces its Arab and Druze people to second class citizens.
Imagine if Sri Lanka?s parliament passes a law stating that Sri Lanka is exclusively a country for the Sinhala Buddhists. Within minutes, international condemnations will pour in. The United States and the European Union will withdraw trade concessions and warn of tough measures if the government fails to reverse the law. Sanctions will be slapped. Sri Lanka will be overnight reduced to a pariah state.
But Israel is often treated with kid gloves and allowed to get away scot free. It can kill a thousand unarmed Palestinians in one go and still strut about on the world stage, with the US patting it on the back and hailing it as ?the only democracy in the Middle East?.? When the abominable law was passed, there was not even a whimper of protest from the Donald Trump administration. Perhaps, Israel was emboldened by Trump?s move to recognise the whole of Jerusalem as the undisputed capital of Israel ? a move that killed Palestinian peace hopes.
Expressing concern, the European Union issued a weak statement that hardly stood up to the depravity of the racist law.? Much weaker was the statement the United Nations Secretary General?s office issued.? "We reaffirm the United Nations' respect for the sovereignty of states to define their constitutional character while emphasizing the need for all states to adhere to universal human rights principles, including the protection of minority rights," said UNSG?s spokesman Farhan Haq.
The passage of the bill, on the contrary, warrants international isolation of Israel ? just as South Africa had been during the apartheid years -- and the reintroduction of the 1975 United Nations General Assembly Resolution which asserted that Zionism was a form of racism.? The resolution had the support of the Non-Aligned Movement. In December 1991, with the Cold War coming to an end, the resolution was revoked, under pressure from and in awe of the US, which was emerging as the sole superpower or, sadly, as the global bully,
unchallenged by any rival.
Israel?s Arabs and the Druze communities have challenged the law in the Israeli Supreme Court, but Zionist hardliners, including Premier Benjamin Netanyahu and Justice Minister Ayelet Shaked, have warned of an earthquake if the courts were to uphold the petitions.
Against this backdrop, a major controversy has erupted in the British Labour Party, with party leader Jeremy Corbyn, who has spoken in support of the Palestinians? freedom cause, being slapped the anti-Semite label.
Corbyn?s problems began in April 2016 when Labour MP Naz Shah criticised Israel on social media posts and endorsed a suggestion that Israel be sent to the US.? This was followed by former London mayor Ken Livingstone?s defence of Shah during a radio show. He added to the controversy by saying Hitler supported Zionism. He later resigned from the Labour Party, following his suspension.
?
These incidents and criticism of Israeli by several Labour activists saw Corbyn being accused of incompetence in dealing with anti-Semitism. In March this year, Jewish community leaders published an open letter accusing him of ?siding with anti-Semites?. Although Corbyn had clarified matters saying he did not and would not support anti-Semitism, he remains vilified in the rightwing media. This is mainly because, Corbyn, in the true spirit of the traditional Labour, has been supporting the Palestinian cause, opposing Britain?s urge to bomb Syria and, domestically, pushing for radical socialist reforms aimed at uplifting the living standards of the working class.
Last month, amidst growing criticism, the Labour Party accepted the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance?s definition of anti-Semitism in a bid to put the controversy to rest once and for all, but rightly did not agree to a stipulation which said criticism of Israel could be deemed anti-Semitism.? The Labour Party argued that legitimate criticism of Israel could not be anti-Semitic. ?
Despite this principled stance, a section of the party wants Corbyn ousted. They are the rightwing members ? the so-called Blairites or supporters of former Prime Minister Tony Blair who lied to the British people to launch the illegal war on Iraq in 2003, and who as the international community?s Middle East peace envoy did nothing but making millions of dollars through his private consultancy business targeted at the region?s despots.
The huge storm the criticism of Israel has created in British politics and the mild condemnations Israel?s apartheid law has evoked only underline the double standards the world has adopted in eliminating racism.? The International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination reaffirms in its preamble that discrimination between human beings on the grounds of race, colour or ethnic origin is an obstacle to friendly and peaceful relations among nations and is capable of disturbing peace and security among peoples and the harmony of persons living side by side even within one and the same State.
In a related controversy, Britain?s former foreign minister Boris Johnson has drawn criticism from Prime Minister Theresa May and rights groups for saying that Muslim women who wear burqas or Niqab look like letter boxes or bank robbers. May, while scolding him, said women should be free to wear the burqa if they
chose to do so.
But this appears to be a rare case of condemnation of Islamophobia defined as ?dislike of or prejudice against Islam or Muslims?. Often, in the name of freedom of expression, any mockery of Islam and its prophet is allowed in the so-called liberal and enlightened West, where academics and researchers are still prevented from questioning the Zionists? narration of the Holocaust or Israel?s right to rob the Palestinians? land.
True, anti-Semitism is bad and needs to be condemned in the strongest possible terms. The Holocaust is remembered not to allow Israel to oppress Palestinians and occupy their lands in violation of international law, but to prevent another Holocaust, irrespective of who the victims are. Sadly, the Palestinians are subjected to a subtle Holocaust, by Israel with the explicit support of the US.
If the strongest condemnation is reserved only in defence of Jewish dignity and is not forthcoming with similar vigour when other ethnic groups and religious communities are ridiculed and their dignity tarnished, then those who are issuing such condemnation are practising the worst form of racism.?

Menacing Menopause
	
?
The female reproduction system is an amazing yet very complicated one. Though many women have a general idea of how the reproduction system works, they are often unaware of what?s in store for them with the onset of Menopause.? ?
Medically, a woman is defined as being in menopause when she hasn?t experienced a menstrual period for at least 12 months. Although it?s a natural process which occurs when a woman reaches the end of her child bearing years, the period building towards menopause is not easily understood. Health Capsule spoke to Consultant Gynaecologist and Obstetrician Dr. Kalinga Nanayakkara to disentangle the intricacies surrounding menopause.? ?
?The ovaries in the female reproductive system produce female egg cells, called the ova. There are approximately 1 million eggs at the time of the birth of a girl child. These ova are transported to the fallopian tube where fertilization by sperm may occur. A fertilised egg moves to the uterus, where the uterine lining thickens in response to the normal hormones of the reproductive cycle. If fertilisation doesn?t take place, the uterine lining starts shedding causing a menstrual flow. To maintain this cycle, the female reproductive system produces female sex hormones,? Dr. Nanayakkara explained.? ?
?
The implant is a small pellet. We make an incision in the buttocks of the patient, insert and place it just under the skin and cover it with a plaster. Such an implant can last up to 3 months. There are also patches or stickers which can be pasted on the buttocks, so that the hormones are absorbed through skin
?
During menopause the female reproductive system gradually stops making the female hormones necessary for the reproductive cycle to work. At this point, menstrual cycles can become irregular and eventually stop. ?The tissues, muscles and ligaments of the body are maintained by the oestrogen hormone. As time lapses, the ova become atrophic and begin to die while the secretion of oestrogen hormone too decreases,?he said.? ?
?A follicle is a small bag like structure in a woman?s ovary in which an egg develops. The follicular phase is the first phase of the cycle, which starts with the woman?s period and ends with ovulation. During this phase, there?s an increase in follicular stimulating hormone called FSH in the body. The FSH and luteinizing hormones (LH) are released from the brain and travel in the blood to the ovaries. Together, they stimulate the growth of about 15-20 eggs in the ovaries, each in its own bag or follicle. These FSH and LH hormones also trigger an increase in the production of the female hormone oestrogen. When oestrogen levels rise, the body turns off the production of FSH. This balance of hormones permits the body to limit the number of follicles that will prepare eggs to be released,? Dr. Nanayakkara elaborated.? ?
The secretion of oestrogen gradually drops when a woman reaches her late forties or early fifties. The normal age for women in Sri Lanka to experience menopause is above 51 years of age, according to the doctor.? ?
?
Signs and Symptoms of Menopause
One of the most common symptoms of Menopause is hot flushes, according to Dr. Nanayakkara. Hot flushes are a sudden feeling of warmth spreading through your body and face. It is often caused by the changing hormone levels that are characteristic of menopause. ?This unannounced brief feeling of intense heat lasts for about 90 seconds and it comes periodically. A woman is also likely to experience night sweats which cause difficulty in sleeping. Night sweats can cause great discomfort and drench your clothing and bedding in sweat, even though the area where you sleep is cool, disturbing your sleep. These are the two main physical changes that women with menopause are likely to experience,? said Dr. Nanayakkara.? ?
?
Ova gradually diminish after about 45 years and menstruation becomes irregular. This stage just before menopause is called perimenopause. If a woman experiences such irregularities in the mestruation cycle, a doctor need to exclude any threats to their health such as a malignancy, as irregular menopause can be a symptom of other undelying illnesses as well
?
In addition to these physical changes, some temperamental changes are also experienced by menopausal women. These may include forgetfulness and a tendency to feel agitated or restless often. Dr. Nanayakkara says that in some instances there may be some long term effects on the cardiovascular system and bones.? ?
?Oestrogen prevents women from being susceptible to heart attacks. When the secretion of oestrogen drops, the likelihood of women experiencing heart attacks is equal to the vulnerability of men,? he explained. Oestrogen also protects bones in a woman?s body as they tend to have smaller and thinner bones. ?A sharp decrease of oestrogen when women reach menopause can develop the risk of osteoporosis; a bone disease that occurs when the body loses too much bone, makes too little bone, or both. The thickness of the bones and the potential for new bone formation decreases. They are easily vulnerable to fractures,? he cautioned.? ?
?
Treatment and management
?When patients complain of hot flushes and night sweats, we usually prescribe a synthetic oestrogen in the form of a tablet. However it must be noted that these are not the same as the contraceptive pills which also contain hormones,? he cautioned.? ?
Conjugated oestrogen of the lowest strength is a form of medicine that contains a mixture of oestrogen hormones. It is used to treat moderate to severe hot flushes and other symptoms of menopause. ?This treatment is called the Hormone Replacement Therapy. Usually doctors place their patients on this therapy until about 60 years of age. We don?t advise hormone replacement therapy, for women beyond 60,? he said. ?We have experienced that after 4 - 5 years of menopause and after 60 years of age, patients hardly ever complain of hot flushes.?? ?
Dr. Nanayakkara says that factors affecting the age of the onset of menopause can vary from person to person. Hereditary factors can cause the early onset of menopause for some women. ?For women who live an active life, they may achieve menopause later. For instance for women who are engaged in continuous work and lead active lives, hormone secretion goes on for a longer time,? he said.? ?
?
Complications
Ova gradually diminish after about 45 years and menstruation becomes irregular. This stage just before menopause is called perimenopause. If a woman experiences such irregularities in the menstruation cycle, a doctor needs to exclude any threats to their health such as a malignancy, as irregular menopause can be a symptom of other underlying illnesses as well. ?However there is no cause to worry as the odds of an irregularity becoming a malignancy is 300 to 1. It is always advisable to seek medical advice if you are experiencing irregularities for about 6 months or more. A gynaecologist must be consulted in such matters,? Dr. Nanayakkara said.? ?
?
A sharp discrease of oestrogen when women reach menopause can develop the risk of osteoporosis; a bone disease that occurs when the body loses too much bone, makes too little bone, or both.?
?
Asked about scepticism surrounding hormone replacement therapy, Dr. Nanayakkara said scientific trials have been conducted to prove that this form of therapy is safe. ?Some women were fearful of the hormone replacement therapy, as a trial which surfaced several years ago found that conjugatory oestrogen increases the incidence of uterine cancer.?
However recent trials have shown that hormone replacement therapy is safe. Most pills prescribed for menopause has both oestrogen which cause the uterine cells to grow and progrestone which causes the cells to mature. These are at a very low dose and therefore are completely safe and prevents any malignancy,? he said.? ?
?
Treatment
Dr. Nanayakkkaara notes that the type of treatment depends entirely on the patient. ?Some patients are able to bear changes of menopause without medication. For such patients we delay this treatment as much as possible. For instance women who are staying at home can manage the changes. A woman engaged in a stressful job may find it difficult to cope with the symptom.?? ?
Although there are several types of treatment available for treatment of menopause, hormonal implants and patches or stickers are not freely available in Sri Lanka. ?The implant is a small pellet. We make an incision in the buttocks of the patient, insert and place it just under the skin and cover it with a plaster. Such an implant can last up to 3 months. There are also patches or stickers which can be pasted on the buttocks, so that the hormones are absorbed through skin,? he described. It wears off after 3 or 4 days after which a new patch must be used. We prescribe this to patients who are reluctant to take the oral treatment.???
The most prescribed medication is in the oral form. ?This is not the contraceptive pill, but a lower dose of conjugated oestrogen available under several brand names. It is important that women experiencing menopause symptoms seek professional medical help rather than self treat their conditions.?
To assess a patient?s condition and deliberate on the treatment, the doctor needs a baseline. He or she needs to evaluate a patient?s blood sugar, cholesterol and blood pressure levels.?
Therefore seeking the medical advice of a professional is essential to determine the type of treatment,? he said.? ?

## Title: PC Poll muddle

PC Poll muddle
	
?
The political parties that launched a massive protest against the Provincial Council system 31 years ago, leading to hundreds of deaths are making a big hue and cry now demanding the Government to hold elections for the same provincial councils. The Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP), the main party that took to the streets then claiming that the Provincial Councils would lead to the division of the country has been running the administrations of several Provincial Councils since 1994.
The majority of the leaders and the members of the SLFP have left the party to join the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP), leaving a small group of the party led by President Maithripala Sirisena to hold its name, SLFP.
If the SLPP does not now hold the stance that the Provincial Councils would divide the country, would its leaders take the responsibility for the lives of the hundreds of people who were killed in the late 1980s while agitating against the creation of provincial councils?
The main slogan of the SLPP and the Joint Opposition now seems to be related to the elections for the three Provincial Councils that stand dissolved after the expiry of their tenure in October last year.
They know that the Government cannot hold the elections for those three councils as there are technical issues to be sorted out after the introduction of the mixed electoral system for Provincial Council elections last September. Yet, they make a big fuss over these elections in order to embarrass the Government before the people who are not acquainted of the election laws.
On the other hand, the new mixed electoral system which has caused the delay in holding of Provincial Council elections was introduced by a Parliamentary Select Committee headed by Mahajana Eksath Peramuna (MEP) leader Dinesh Gunawardane during the tenures of Presidents Chandrika Kumaratunga and Mahinda Rajapaksa.
Only the ratio between the number of members elected under the First-Past-The-Post (FPP) system and the Proportional Representation (PR) was decided during the present regime, by the party leaders.
The SLPP Chairman, former Constitutional Affairs Minister Professor G.L. Peiris had recently said that his party would take legal action against the National Elections Commission over the delay in holding Provincial Council elections.
This seems to be just a ploy to pressurize and embarrass the Government over the matter. The Chairman of the Elections Commission Mahinda Deshapriya had told last week in an interview with the Sunday Lankadeepa that the ball was now in the Parliament?s court and not in his.
He had explained clearly the reasons for the delay in holding elections for the Eastern, Sabaragamuwa and North Central provincial councils.
When the Commission was preparing to hold these elections in December last year the relevant election Act was amended in September in the same year compelling the Commission to delay the elections until the delimitation of wards in Provincial Council areas was completed, he had stated. After the enactment of the Provincial Councils Elections Amendment Act to introduce the mixed electoral system, a fundamental rights petition was filed against its adoption in the Parliament by former Chief Justice Sarath N. Silva on the grounds that the new electoral system was introduced in a fraudulent manner through an amendment to another amendment to the original Act, without giving prior notice to the House and the Supreme Court.
However, it was dismissed by the Supreme Court last month.
The new electoral system necessitated wards and a Delimitation Commission was appointed to demarcate the boundaries of the wards. The Delimitation Commission?s Chairman K. Thavalingam had handed over his Commission?s report to Provincial Councils and Local Government Minister Faiszer Mustapha recently.
The Minister, in turn, has presented it to Parliament for ratification. Mr Deshapriya in his interview explained that Speaker Karu Jayasuriya had included the matter in the Order Paper of Parliament, but the House had not taken it for discussion yet. In the meantime, a section of Parliamentarians affiliated to both the ruling party and the Opposition now demands that the law must be changed again to enable the Provincial Council elections to be held under the old PR system.
Before the mixed electoral system was introduced it was only the small and minority parties that preferred the PR system. But it was after the February 10 Local Government elections that many flaws in the mixed system were identified.
?
"The main slogan of the SLPP and the Joint Opposition now seems to be related to the elections for the three Provincial Councils that stand dissolved after the expiry of their tenure in October last year "
In the wake of the LG elections even former President Mahinda Rajapaksa under whose leadership the SLPP swept the electorate had stated that the new system had to be changed again as it had created a mess in many LG bodies.
An ?all-party? meeting chaired by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe was held on August 1 at the Temple Trees, the official residence of the Prime Minister to discuss the electoral system under which the PC election should be conducted.
It reportedly ended inconclusively.
Joint Opposition and the JVP, (two groups) which press the Government to hold the PC elections right away had not participated in the meeting.
Meanwhile, the Sunday Times reported that Elections Commission Chief Deshapriya and K. Thavalingam, who served as the Chairmen of the Delimitation Commission had resigned from a six-member committee appointed by Speaker Karu Jayasuriya and headed by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe citing ?conflict of interest? involved in the process.
There are strong grounds not only for the politicians but also for the people to reject the mixed-electoral system in its present form, despite it having been experimented with only at the last LG polls. It doubled the number of LG members (From around 4000 to 8000).
Without a cut-off point for political parties to be eligible to represent the councils, many small parties won seats creating an Opposition larger than the ruling party in many councils.
This muddled situation was further aggravated by the ridding of the bonus seat system that strengthened the winning parties earlier.
There are no signs of this controversy over the electoral system being sorted out in the near future, despite predictions being made by Government Ministers that the elections would be held in January next year.
The allegation by the Opposition that the Government wanted the PC elections to be postponed is not without reasons.When the Supreme Court ruled in September last year that the 20th Amendment to the Constitution Bill was not consistent with the Constitution on the grounds that it would cause the postponement of Provincial Council elections, the Government sneaked in the mixed electoral system, which in fact necessitated the postponement of PC elections as an amendment to another Bill and got adopted.
Not only the PC elections but rather the whole PC system has become a mess and meaningless.
The proportionality between the service done by the PCs and the funds spent for maintenance? is questionable. They have just become a forum for the politicians in the Parliament to groom their sons and daughters as politicians.
The system was meant mainly for the resolution of the ethnic problem. In fact, PCs were to be created initially only in the north and the east.
That means only the Tamil dominated provinces needed such a mechanism under the power devolution. But even the Northern Provincial Council does not seem to have understood it.
The NPC is now being accused of being over-politicized. The Sunday Times in its July 29 issue reported that the NPC had adopted 415 resolutions during its five-year tenure, seven resolutions a day it had met, but many resolutions adopted had been related to issues which mostly do not come within the purview of the NPC.

PCoI: BoC waived off Rs.168mn from interest of Mihin?s loans
	
The Bank of Ceylon (BoC) had waived off Rs.168 million from the interest of the Overdrafts (ODs) and loans amounting to Rs.173 million borrowed by Mihin Lanka (Pvt) Limited from 2007 to 2009, BoC Relationship Manager Prageeth Lasantha Balasuriya told the Presidential Commission of Inquiry (PCoI) on alleged irregularities at SriLankan Airlines, SriLankan Catering and Mihin Lanka yesterday.
He informed the Commission that the Government had obtained a Loan amounting to Rs.1.381 billion in March, 2009 to settle the ODs and loans borrowed by Mihin Lanka during that period.
During his testimony it was also revealed that Mihin Lanka (Pvt) Limited had obtained several ODs and loans from 2007 to 2009 and it was notified that most of the borrowings had taken place without a guarantee.
He informed the Commission during the period from 2007 and 2009, Gotabaya Rajapaksa was the Chairman of Mihin Lanka (Pvt) Limited and requests were made by the then Board of Directors of Mihin stating that the company needed to improve their working capital.
However, he informed the Commission, the BoC had not considered the waived off interest amount as a loss because it would be a bigger loss if the bank had kept these loans and ODs for a further period.
He also informed the Commission that a short term loan obtained by the present board of Directors of Mihin Lanka in November, 2016 amounting to USD 2.5 million was also given an extension to complete the loan till March, 2018 but the Government Treasury as the loan guarantee had so far not settled the amount.
He further informed the Commission that another loan obtained by the present Board of Directors of Mihin Lanka (Pvt) limited in 2016 amounting to Rs.1.6 billion was also extended till March 2019 and the Bank had sent the claims to the Mihin Lanka Liquidator. (Yoshitha Perera)

Parliament's High Post Committee yesterday approved the nomination of former Ambassador Dr. Dayan Jayatilake as Sri Lanka?s envoy in Russia, despite the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) and the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) opposing it, it is learnt.
President Maithripala Sirisena nominated him to the post. However, there were some disagreements at the High Post Committee of Parliament.
It is a parliamentary committee that affirms appointment to key positions such as ambassadors, high commissioners and chairmen to government institutions after considering their qualifications. There were some civil society organizations that raised objection to Dr. Jayatilake?s appointment.
Despite the approval of Dr. Jayatilake?s nomination, the High Post Committee decided to write to the President saying that the conduct of Dr. Jayatilake was unsatisfactory, especially after he was called before the Committee. (Kelum Bandara)

Racial Myths and Middle Path
	
A response to the article on Countering Racial Myths through Middle Path
?
I refer to the above titled article written by K.K.S. Perera (KKS) and published in the Daily Mirror of July 28 and would like to respond to some of the views expressed therein from a Hindu point of view. I do so with due respect to his views, in the spirit of debate, without any animus.? ?
It is Mr. KKS?s view that Races are myths and have no significance as human beings. Is this view true in the light of the reality of the world? The differentiation of people on the basis of Races, is a self-evident reality. Isn?t this differentiation seen in the physical features, pigmentation of colour and other sociological criteria, as European, Mongoloid, Negroid, Asiatic races, Aryans, Dravidian, etc. Even within the broad divisions,there are many sub-divisions with tribal and clan origins. Is this a myth or an existential truth. Races organically evolved millennia ago from tribes and clans, sharing common customs, social practices and dialect to communicate. Mr. KKS speaks of countering Racial Myths through the Middle Path, which is another name for Buddhism. Ironically, Buddhism and the Middle Path, instead of countering racial myths, artificially added another Race, the Sinhala Race. The introduction of Buddhism, together with a pickled new language adapted using largely Tamil and Sanskrit words and some Portuguese and English words, created the Sinhala Race.This contradicts Mr. KKs?s proposition of countering racial myths through the Middle Path. The Sinhala race is a post-Buddhist creation.? ?
Mr. KKS states that ?when we divide and call ourselves Sri Lankans, Sinhalese, Muslim, Christian or anything else (Hindu omitted, may be they belong to the latter category), we are separating ourselves from rest of mankind and we become violent.? According to this, even countries should not have an identifiable name. If the name of the country is Sri Lanka, how else can the people of the country be called other than Sri Lankans? Further, he ludicrously asks us to ?check your body carefully as possible. Is there any particular part in it or spot which differentiates it as a Muslim, Sinhalese or Tamil?? He fails to realize that Race is a description of a person. It is external to the body. It is not a finite thing to be found in the biological body of a person. Mr. KKS further states that ?all human beings belong to one species only, the human variety/species is called Homosapiens.? I wonder whether Mr. KKS calls himself a Sinhala Buddhist or a Homosapiens, then his creed is Humanism and not Buddhism.? ?
Walls of Racial and Religious separations
All Religions are founded by persons, with the exception of Hinduism. Therefore, the person, the Founder and his teachings, doctrines, differ from other Founder person and his teachings and doctrines. Hence separations among religions are a natural outcome. But this does not mean these separations are water-tight, rigid and closed entities, without interaction with the outside world. Their respective identities are inevitable. So are Races, with distinct physical, sociological,and language differences. From the wording of Mr. KKS?s essay, ?Countering Racial myths through Middle Path,? it is apparently clear that Mr. KKS?s motive and proposition, is to counter and reduce all different Races and Religions to a common denominator, the so-called Middle Path, which is nothing but Buddhism. Is it practical to bring all Races and Religions to one Universal Race and Religion, on the foundation of one Religion, (more correctly one ethical Philosophy) Buddhism, which is his implicit assertion. Not a single religion founded by a mortal man, Jesus Christ, or Prophet Muhammed or Buddha, will disband and dissolve their Founder?s teachings and doctrines, and accept another Founder?s teachings/doctrines and his Authority. Christians will not become Buddhists, Hindus or Islamist or vice versa or Hindus become Buddhists, Islamist, Christian or vice versa or Buddhists become Christians, Hindus, Islamist or vice versa. None of the Religions founded by a mortal Man, is qualified to be one Universal Religion. If there is any one Religion, which can rightfully claim to be a Universal Religion, it is only Hinduism.That is because Hinduism is not founded on the Authority and teachings of a mortal man. Its teachings are not based on a Person but on Eternal Principles, which are not man-made, but Revealed to the Great Rishis since dawn of time and passed by word of mouth from successive line of Rishis, and only rendered into written word around 3000 BC in the form of the? Vedas? by the Great Rishi Vyasa, the author of the Epic Mahabaratha.? ?
Religion and God
A Religion without the conception of a Godhead is no religion. Major world Religions such as Christianity, Islam and Hinduism are theistic religions. The word ?God? is an English word, and as far as Hinduism is concerned, it is a misnomer. The term God signifies the conception of a Personal Being. But in Hinduism God is Impersonal but He is also personified in Personal Form as Hindu Deities for the devotees to understand the Impersonal, nameless, formless One, that is Infinite, all-embracing and all- pervasive. To give form, is to limit its Infiniteness. God is One Infinite, Extra-Cosmic Power, the source of all Finites that exists. In Hindu metaphysical or philosophical nomenclature He is called Brahman. He is personified in forms. He manifests as Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva, the Creator, Preserver and the Destroyer respectively, (the Trimurthies) with their Consorts, Saraswathy or Luxshmi and Shakthi. The Christians call their God, Our Father, Islam, as Allah.
Buddhism has no Godhead. It can be called Agnosticism or Atheism, not subscribing to any Extra-Cosmic Power, but the Founder Lord Buddha (a mortal being) is deified like a God by his followers. Mr. KKS debunks those who believe in a Godhead by saying that ?only a mentally unsound person sees illusions or things that do not exists, but believes that they do exists.? Elusiveness of something does not mean it does not exist. For instance, there are electric, sound and magnetic waves in the atmosphere which cannot be seen or felt, yet can we conclude that these do not exist? The extra-cosmic power that is latent in the Universe, cannot be seen, touched or felt or proved by scientific laboratory experiments and tests. One has to realize and experience the presence of the Divine Entity/Power.
?
"Is it practical to bring all Races and Religions to one Universal Race and Religion, on the foundation of one Religion"
?
Moreover, every unit of human organization has a Leader, for a Family, Community, the State, for regulation and control of these Units. These cannot function without Leaders. If this is so, a cosmos which is so infinitely vast and complex in its variety, with the Sun, Moon and multiplicity of Planets and sub-planets, should have an Extra-Cosmic Power to regulate and control its activities. This is evidenced by the precision and regularity of its functioning and movements of the Sun, Moon and other planets and their rotations and revolutions, measure an unit of time, the seasons, etc. All these cannot be attributed to chance: Because chance and regularity do not go together. Those who believe in God (Universal term) are ?not mentally unsound, seeing illusions that do not exist, but believe to Exist,? as Mr. KKS contends. On the other hand, how could one reconcile, the latter?s statement with the illusion of a Nibbana? How can one know there is a state of Nibbana. If God is not verifiably exists, so is Nibbana which does not verifiably exist. Has anyone seen and/or felt Nibbana? It is also an unknowable belief as much as a belief in a God.?
To conclude, Mr. KKS quotes a passage which is inconsistent with, and contradicts Mr. KKS?s statement that ?only mentally unsound person see illusions or things that do not exist, but believes that they do exist.? It says ?that Bhagava (Sanskrit Bhagavan means God) set in motion the Supreme Wheel of Dhamma, which cannot be stopped by?? Devas, Brahma or anyone else?. Devas, Brahmma that do not exist, have existed for the writer of the above passage. Further at that instant ?thousandfold planetary system quaked, shook and trembled and a vast magnificent radiance emerged, outshining the splendor of the Devas?. It appears the writer has seen in his overzealous state of imagination, illusory visions that did not exist, the splendour of the Devas.??

Russia denounces new U.S. sanctions as illegal: Mulls retaliation
	
?
MOSCOW REUTERS Aug 9? - Russia condemned a new round of U.S. sanctions as illegal on Thursday and said it had begun working on retaliatory measures after news of the curbs pushed the rouble to two-year lows over fears Moscow was locked in a spiral of never-ending sanctions.? ?
?Moscow has been trying with mixed success to improve battered U.S.-Russia ties since Donald Trump won the White House in 2016, and Russia?s political elite was quick to chalk up a summit last month between Trump and Vladimir Putin as a victory.? ? But initial triumphalism swiftly turned sour as anger over what some U.S. lawmakers saw as an over deferential performance by Trump and his failure to confront Putin over Moscow?s alleged meddling in U.S. politics galvanised a new sanctions push.? ?
?The new sanctions come in two tranches. The first, which targets U.S. exports of sensitive national-security related goods, comes with deep exemptions and many of the items it covers have already been banned by previous restrictions.? ?
?The second tranche, which can be selectively activated after 90 days if Moscow fails to provide ?reliable assurances? it will no longer use chemical weapons and blocks on-site inspections, is potentially more serious.? ?

Speaker advises Sajith and Wimal
	
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya yesterday advised both Housing Minister Sajith Premadasa and his former counterpart Wimal Weerawansa not to waste valuable Parliament time.
The Speaker came out with the advice as both Premadasa and Weerawansa were engaged in a showdown in the House by making allegations against each other.
Mr Weerawansa accused Minister Premadasa of recruiting a large number of youth from Hambantota District to the Housing Authority on a daily basis, claiming it added a burden to the authority.
Mr. Premadasa said people have been recruited as manpower was needed to carry out the work of the housing authority and the housing ministry. Also, he accused Mr. Weerawansa of giving government houses to his relatives. Mr. Weerawansa has seen raising points of order several times while Mr. Premadasa demanded time to reply. ?Both of you are disturbing the House without allowing us to go through with important business. Please refrain from wasting time,? the Speaker told Mr. Premadasa and Mr. Weerawansa. (Yohan Perera and Ajith Siriwardana)

Sri Lanka has positive attitude on conserving Dutch heritage  sites
	
?
Leading Dutch Archaeologist Oscar Hefting was in Sri Lanka recently to visit the Dutch heritage sites in the country and discuss measures for their proper conservation. The Dutch East India Company drove out the Portuguese from Sri Lanka in 1636 and established its rule over the maritime provinces. It ended after the British conquered Sri Lanka and ousted the Dutch.? ?
Mr. Hefting spoke of similarities between the Galle Fort and the fortified town of Naarden in the Netherlands. He is currently the Director of Dutch Fortress Museum. He shared his thoughts on the Dutch heritage in Sri Lanka in an interview with Daily Mirror.
?
?
?Q? What is your opinion on the Dutch heritage here?
There is a lot of Dutch heritage in Sri Lanka. There are 30 fortifications. If you do not use them, they will be lost. You have to use them in terms of museums or restaurants. You should have new reasons to protect them. Like in Galle, for instance, people are working hard to keep this heritage alive. They can earn money because of tourism. There is one heritage site called Naarden in the Netherlands. It is more like Galle. Jaffna fort is also similar to Nardeen Fort. The building traditions came from the Netherlands to Sri Lanka. Therefore, it is good to cooperate with each other and work hard. There are 22 Dutch forts in Sri Lanka according to a map from 1751. Later, there were more. Altogether there are at least 30 forts here. The Dutch were here for elephants and cinnamon. What is needed is to make an inventory of what is existing. We combine the Sri Lankan knowledge with Dutch knowledge. You have a lot of expertise with the National Archives and the Department of Archaeology.? ?
That is to make sure that the heritage sites are not overbuilt by new structures. You have to realize that this is historical heritage.? ?
?Q??How do you find the current status of Dutch heritage sites in Sri Lanka?
Some are very well looked after. Galle fort is an example. It is well taken care of. Some buildings are really in trouble though. At least there is the Galle Heritage Foundation.? ?
?Q??How have these later addition of buildings and constructions such as the cricket stadium affected the archaeological value of the Dutch Fort in your view?
That is a delicate discussion. As I understood, there was no permission to start special buildings. The cricket ground does not seem to be the problem, but the smaller buildings.? ?
?
Happy about the co-operation from SL authorities 
Dutch archaeologist says it?s similar in Brazil 
But such work is difficult in former Dutch colonies like South Africa and Indonesia?
?
?Q??You mean the small buildings connected to the stadium?
Yes. That is in the hands of the UNESCO, however. It is a diplomatic affair.? ?
?Q??Have you taken it up with the Sri Lankan Government?
No. It is a matter lying with UNESCO. One of the important things to do. Before you start building, you should know that you are working in a protected area. It appears that damage has already been done because the building stands on the heritage site.? ?
?Q??How do you find the status of other Dutch fortifications in Sri Lanka?
The English destroyed the fort of Colombo. You can find back parts and make it a tourist attraction site. The English destroyed the fort of Kalutara as well. In the north, restoration was difficult because there was a war going on. Some of the forts, like the ones in Mannar and Jaffna, were damaged. But, restoration work is progressing now. I am happy to see the energy going on here with the help of the Dutch embassy for restoration work in Jaffna. ?
?Q??As you mentioned, how can they be put to good use?
They have planned to create a museum in Jaffna as I understood. Then, they can ask for an entrance fee. It is not the case now. You can restore the Church. That is an idea. The original Dutch Reformed Church was destroyed there. These are things to be put in use. Then, you can attract tourists as these are in fascinating locations.? ?
?Q??How do you compare and contrast the status of Dutch heritage in Sri Lanka with that of other Dutch colonies in the world?
Every country is different. It is much disputed in Indonesia because the Dutch rule ended there with the war. The independence of Indonesia came after war with the Dutch. It is tricky in Indonesia as a result. In South Africa, there is a strict line between the Blacks and Whites over why the Dutch were there. There have always been discussions regarding discrimination between the Blacks and the Whites. It has been positive in the United States and Brazil as in Sri Lanka. They have a positive attitude towards the Dutch period.? ?
?Q??In general, there may not be animosity against the Dutch. But, there can be local sentiments in the conservation of the Dutch heritage sites because they are seen as monuments of invaders. How do you reconcile such local sentiments?
You have to take it as part of history. When bad things happened in your youth, you had to give them a place to see how you were created. In the Netherlands, we had German occupation during? World War II. They built a lot of bunkers and forts in the Netherlands. It is important for our history. Let?s take care of it.? ?
?Q??How is the support from the Sri Lankan Government to preserve the Dutch heritage?
This is a good example. Sri Lanka tourism cooperates well. The Department of archaeology is very much willing to assist. The attitude of your government is very positive.? ?
?Q??What kind of assistance is the Dutch Government extending to Sri Lanka in this exercise?
There is financial assistance. The Dutch embassy is supporting identification. Your Department of Archaeology is willing to cooperate. So does the Department of National Archives. When I am back in the Netherlands, I will be meeting a group of Sri Lankans for knowledge exchange.? ?
?Q??How do you find the legacy left behind by the Dutch in Sri Lanka in terms of its culture?
Surprisingly, there is enormous influence still in Sri Lanka. Burghers are still a community here. They are telling us about their influence and network. It is a strong line from a historical perspective. You have many Sri Lankans who have been to the Netherlands already. There is a positive link because of our historical relations. Your ambassador in the Netherlands told us that the Dutch were very good at infrastructure development -- transport, irrigation, etc.? ?
We intend to come back here next year. That is to have this exhibition. We will have it probably in Matara. We are also looking at Galle and Jaffna.? ?
?
Surprisingly, there is enormous influence still in Sri Lanka. Burghers are still a community here
Some are very well looked after. Galle fort is an example. It is well taken care of. Some buildings are really in trouble though
?
?Q??Is this the first time you are organizing it here?
Yes. I did it in Brazil. We did excavation. They are having a museum now. We are working on Dutch fortifications overseas. Next year, we are going to have an exhibition in South Africa. We are going to have another in West Africa.? ?
?Q??How is co-operation from each of these countries?
It differs from country to country. In Brazil, it is very good. It is very difficult in South Africa. It is very good in Sri Lanka. The support is very positive. Even I think there is money needed for restoration to be done in the right way and the inventory completed. It fits into a tourism programme.? ?
?Q??Apart from the Dutch heritage, we have a whole of other archaeological sites. Is there any assistance coming from the Dutch government to restore them as well?
Not that I know of. But the exchanges are there. Technicians can be used on forts and other sites. ?
?Q??How is Sri Lanka portrayed in Dutch history?
Sri Lanka is positively portrayed there. A lot of Sri Lankans go there. It is an ideal country for a holiday.? ?
?Q??I mean, in academic studies on history, how is Sri Lanka portrayed?
Well, in the first place, Sri Lanka is an economically important island. A lot of investments were sent here. Sri Lanka was very important for the Dutch economy during the colonial era. That is for cinnamon and elephants. They wanted to have a monopoly on cinnamon here. That is why all these forts were here. Building forts is very important.??

Sri Lanka?s Voluntary National Review on UN SDGs: Sri Lanka has significantly progressed in educatio
	
Sri Lanka has faced challenges in terms of transportation; housing and environmental issues due to urbanization and policy measures have been taken to address these issues
?
Sri Lanka?s Voluntary National Review (VNR) on the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDG)s to be submitted to the High-level Political Forum (HLPF) of the United Nations shows that the country is making headway in successfully achieving the SDGs but certain areas are needed to tackle issues related to climate change, land degradation and deforestation.? ?
Much of the work has been undertaken in the past year after the enactment of the Sustainable Development Act by the Sri Lanka Parliament in October 2017 which provides for the formulating of a national sustainable development policy and strategy? ?
Sri Lanka VNR on the Status of Implementing Sustainable Development Goals was prepared by the Ministry of Sustainable Development, Wildlife and Regional Development to be submitted to the UN this month.?
?
"There are a number of targets/areas which are only partially aligned, in particular those related to environment
and partnerships"
In the past year the Government has taken several initiatives to mainstream the SDGs in the country.
These measures included the establishment of a Parliamentary Select Committee on Sustainable Development, the enactment of the Sustainable Development Act No. 19 of 2017 and the establishment of a Ministry to serve as the focal point for coordinating and facilitating the implementation of SDGs.? ?
The VNR pointed out that with the introduction of the Vision 2025 with emphasis on the ?Blue Green? Budget of 2018, the Review found that national policies are well aligned with the SDGs at both Goal and Target levels.? ?
?However, there are a number of targets/areas which are only partially aligned, in particular those related to environment and partnerships.??
Sri Lanka VNR covered all 17 SDGs and analysed the current status and trends, gaps and challenges and the way forward for each of the SDG with detailed analyses on the goals selected for in-depth review at the 2018 HLPF.? ?The Review with regard to SDG 6, is that Sri Lanka has made good progress .These are in terms of access to safe drinking water, though there are regional disparities to be addressed.? t was found that climate change impacts can bring in challenges in this regard. A majority of households possess onsite sanitation facilities, but, there is a need for a centralized sewerage system in order to minimize possible health and environmental impacts of onsite facilities, VNR said.? ?
It said that with regards to SDG 7, rising fossil fuel dependency has become a major challenge in the energy sector.? ?
??The country has made achievements in terms of electrification. Renewable energy sources play an important role and there is much potential for further utilization of renewable energy sources, including solar energy,? the VNR said.? ?
?
"A majority of households possess onsite sanitation facilities, but, there is a need for a centralized sewerage system in order to minimize possible health and environmental impacts"
It added that Sri Lanka has faced challenges in terms of transportation; housing and environmental issues due to urbanization and policy measures have been taken to address these issues.? ?
The Review said that the National Disaster Management Plan 2018-2030 has been prepared to address the issues related to disaster risk reduction.? The VNR also pointed out that Forest degradation is a major cause for loss of biodiversity and it is also associated with land degradation and proper enforcement of related laws is important to minimize forest degradation and deforestation.? ?
This, the VNR, said, should be clearly demarcated with forest boundaries, and through strengthening the capacity of forest managing agencies and increasing public awareness.? ?
?The Review said that Sri Lanka has made significant progress in several areas related to SDGs, in particular education, health
and poverty.?? The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are a common call of action to bring an end to poverty, protect the earth and ensure that all people enjoy peace, prosperity and a secure future. The targets as given by the United Nations (UN) address 17 key areas including climate change, innovation, sustainable production and consumption, economic inequalities and education.? ?
The VNR added that Sri Lanka is headed towards a sustainable and resilient society. The poverty rate in the country has dropped to 4.1% in 2016 and is moving towards an upper-middle-income status nation with a per capita GDP of $4066 (USD). Unemployment rates are at a low of 5% for the past seven years.??

The dimensions and degrees of privilege
	
?
Like most other terms and words in the English language, ?privilege? has an old and colourful history. In the early centuries it was a right, a priority, and as the decades progressed and made way for the Roman Empire, it was taken to mean a bill in favour of an individual. It was a law, essentially
Later, when the English pioneered a new legal system with an emphasis on the parliament and individual rights, privileges were stringently defined in terms of institutions, not individuals. Powers which accrued to persons were thus never, theoretically at least, the prerogative of those persons, but rather of the institutions which they represented. Even the Royal Prerogative, more symbolic than practical today, was meant to symbolise the overarching presence of the monarchy, and not the monarch. In other words, privilege lost its earlier identification with particular individuals and laws and took on a symbolist, metaphoric character.? ?
Privilege, then, is best understood today as an abstraction, and is best seen in relation to abstractions. It is relative. Malleable. What is a birthright to some is an absolute right to others. What the few possess, the many do not. What the many rebel for, the few have. In a world where no one can have everything and where nothing can be in the hands of everyone, it is natural that conflicts arise when people are defined in relation to what Karl Polanyi once memorably referred to as fictitious commodities. In the Augustine and post-Augustine world, long before the advent of industrialisation, people were essentially either chattels or owners, either serfs or landlords. As such, it was not difficult to define a privilege in absolute, concrete terms. When the bond between serf and landlord broke down and industrial capitalism took over the reins of Western civilization, the most immediate consequence was the substitution of capital interests for land. In his introduction to The Condition of the Working Class in England, Friedrich Engels brilliantly captures this transition from the manor to the market. Once the transition was over, privilege became an obscure, pliable yardstick. Societies once colonised by the West have historically been worse off than the rest of the world when it comes to the rift between the many and the few, for two obvious reasons: they were effectively robbed of the resources and the industries they had, and they were ruled on the basis of the continuation of pre-existing social gulfs. What little remained was then siphoned off to those powerful aristocracies which could be counted on to support the coloniser, even at the cost of the enslaved. In colonial societies, these resources thus became the ultimate symbols of privilege, and they were used to create an entire social milieu which thrived on a bourgeois, caste-run and quasi-feudal worldview. Sri Lanka was no stranger to this process of economic imperialism, which passed through two distinct but still related epochs: that of the landowning traditional elite and that of the arrack renting capitalist bourgeoisie.??

"Societies once colonised by the West have historically been worse off than the rest of the world when it comes to the rift between the many and the few, for two obvious reasons: they were effectively robbed of the resources they had and ruled on the basis of the continuation of pre-existing social gulfs"
What happened when the white man left? He left behind a society which distinguished the majority from the minority. Western liberalism is strange and paradoxical in that it champions democracy and individual rights, and yet rejects both. The reason is clear. From Rousseau to Locke, liberalism was premised on the separation of the multitude, who cannot be trusted, from the minority, the elite, who can be. (My friend Krisantha: ?They say they?re for democracy AND insist that the majority are backward!?) It is this idea of individual rights, a creature of capitalism, which found its way to colonial societies, and which continues to define the parameters of privilege in those societies: privilege that comes in different shades, colours, and hues.
For this reason, Western capitalism, with its intrinsic distrust of the majority, and its deification of the minority, turned it into an abstraction. Feudal societies had defined it clearly, in terms of land relations. Capitalist societies or societies half-rooted in capitalism (like ours), perhaps because of the ambivalent nature of Western liberalism, could not define it clearly.? ?
We find privilege in almost every corner. Those who have money, those who can speak, read, and write in English, those who are in politics, those who are supporters of politicians, and those who grab the opportune moment and join politicians on their way to the top are, in societies like ours, in a class of their own. They are privileged and they define their privileged status in relation to everyone else around them.? ?
When Dayasiri Jayasekara made that infamous gaffe trying to pronounce a Latin saying (the motto of a school) last year, he was castigated in every quarter. When no less a person than our president made gaffe after gaffe giving a speech in English, he was rounded up and rebuked. So strange were the notions entertained of goodness and badness in speaking a different language in each case that no one batted as much as an eyelid when representatives of a mainly Sinhalese and Tamil society made gaffe after gaffe in the mother tongue (especially Sinhala) in the parliament. I can mention at least five names from the ruling parties who muddle up Sinhala in ways which would make even the most ordinary speaker blush. And yet, as a friend once told me, we are content in letting these politicos off the hook because we don?t care about what makes us who we are. We are more concerned with how we pronounce another language. When residents of a given society judge one another based on a language or a marker of privilege created in another society, what does that say about those residents? It says a lot, I should think, and it makes evident the flawed premises and assumptions on which such societies (are) run. That is why I am confused why parents insist on their children learning how to speak English rather than how to read and write it effectively. When elocution is privileged over literature and grammar, how can a nation turn out writers, artists, or even intellectuals? Is this not one reason why we haven?t been able to produce an original thinker in English, an observation which Liyanage Amarakeerthi made years ago in an article on Gunadasa Amarasekara? Politicians love to talk about ape kama, or our way, forgetting that ape kama is much more than political rhetoric. It all starts with the way we look at our compatriots.? ?
Privilege in a society like ours, naturally, is borne of ignorance. Ignorance, that is, of what entails privilege and what makes up a person of high renown. The political sphere that January the 8th, 2015, brought forth was birthed by assumptions about intelligence and prestige which have since been proven to be patently false. If English speaking technocrats, as opposed to village baiyas, could make this society better than what it was, 2015 and 2016 were let-down years which proved that this was nothing more than a myth. The elitism associated with the party of the young, the UNP, was in that sense a fluke. It was good advertising, and like all good advertising, the myths it perpetuated are still being sustained by a good (great?) proportion of the population.? ?

"When residents of a given society judge one another based on a language or a marker of privilege created in another society, what does that say about those residents"
How many of those who mocked Dayasiri Jayasekara can spell their names and write essays in Latin? (Let?s be more precise here: how many of those not-so ?old? boys who castigated the man on social media can read a sentence in Latin?) How many of those who took Maithripala Sirisena to task over his speeches can write a proper essay in English (as opposed to the clich?d-ridden tommy-rot you come across in newspapers and journals every day)? My guess is, not many. That is why privilege, so often a marker of distinction in the world, has been a product of centuries of exploitation, misery, oppression, and ignorance in societies like ours that are still emerging from colonialism. It was this sort of ignorance which made critics of the former regime rationalise their dislike of the Rajapaksas in terms of their preference for political elites conversant in Western habits. The colonial hangover, which has been written on and dissected at length by critics more scholarly than me, remains an everlasting symbol of pride for the few, and sadness for the many, here. There are, the way I see it, two ways of combating the feelings of inadequacy and inferiority this compels.? ?
The first is by turning those feelings into an instrument of self-pity, by joining the crowd and bringing down others on their ?way up? on the basis of their inadequacies in those aforementioned criteria of privilege. This is what most revolutionaries do, and what the ruckus over private education has turned out to be.
The second, the method I prefer, is to turn those tools of oppression into tools of empowerment. Somewhere in the 1970s a man called Douglas Walatara pioneered a method of teaching English which even those with a smattering of knowledge in the language could access in the remotest schools. It is this method that, in later decades, was contorted and turned into what is referred to as English Our Way. Forget that, though. The point is, we can either be revolutionaries or be another Douglas Walatara. My choice, the only one that would make sense, is to be the latter. That is one way, if not the only way, through which privilege can be, if not completely combated, then at least partly ameliorated.

The Septic dilemma
	
?
The field of medicine has advanced in leaps and bounds through the past few decades. Akin to a pulsating living organism, it is one that continues to evolve and change with time. But even in the wake of all these advancements sepsis or what has come to be known as ?blood poisoning? in laymen?s terminology continues to wreak havoc in modern healthcare institutions the world over. The National Confidential Enquiry into Patient Outcome & Death (NCEPOD, 2015) in the UK, highlighted sepsis as being the leading cause of ?avoidable death? that kills more people than breast, bowel and prostate cancers combined. In American hospitals sepsis has been named as the most expensive ?in-patient? cost in 2014 averaging more than $18,000 per hospital stay with over 1.5 million sepsis related hospital stays within that year alone.We spoke to Dr. Ambalavanar Ragupathy. MBBS, MD (Medicine)? ??
MRCP (UK), Consultant Physician BH-Tellippalai to educate our readers on this health condition.?
Though the term sepsis is more closely associated with the modern day intensive care setup, the concept is in fact far older. The word was first coined by the Father of Western medicine-Hippocrates, himself and is derived from the Greek word ?sipsi? (?make rotten?) In the 1800?s the work of French chemist Louis Pasteur and British surgeon Joseph Lister had a significant impact on the treatment of sepsis. Pasteur deduced that tiny single celled organisms called ?bacteria? were responsible for putrefaction or sepsis and further discovered that bacteria in fluids could be killed by heating. Taking Pasteur?s findings into consideration Lister championed the utilisation of Carbolic Acid as an Antiseptic to sterilise surgical instruments and clean wounds at the Glasgow Royal Infirmary where he was head of Surgery. By doing so he was able to drastically reduce post-amputation mortality of patients which were as high as 50%. Although Anti-septic methodologies proved to be an immense breakthrough in medicine it was with the advent of antibiotics in World War 2 that mortality due to sepsis were further reduced.? ?
?
What is Sepsis?
Sepsis is a consequence of an infection. Usually this occurs as a consequence of bacterial infections, but viral, fungal and even parasitic organisms have also been known to cause this condition. Our immune system is the first line of defense against any and all infections. But sometimes the body?s response to an infection can cause serious injury to its own tissues and organs. To put it bluntly our immune system stops fighting the infection and starts turning on itself! This is the start of sepsis. If I were to sum up what sepsis is in one sentence, it would be ?a life threatening organ dysfunction due to a deregulated host response?to infection.??
?
What are the signs and symptoms of Sepsis?
The common signs and symptoms are,?
Fever??
	Increased Heart rate (Tachycardia)??
	Increased Respiratory rate (Tachypnea)? ?
	Decreased urine output (Oliguria)??
	Drowsiness, confusion and irritability (during Severe Sepsis)??
	Low blood pressure (during Septic Shock)??
However these signs and symptoms may also vary depending on the specific focus of the infection. Sepsis could present as a consequence of a urinary tract infection (UTI), respiratory tract infection (RTI) and bowel related infections; or it could even result from skin infections due to defects in its integrity, if left untreated. So, an individual with a urinary tract infection could present with painful or increased frequency of micturition. Someone with respiratory tract infections could display a productive cough or difficulty in breathing and vice versa.? ?
?
Who are most susceptible to this condition?
Sepsis is a condition that can affect almost anyone. But there are several categories or groups of people who are more susceptible to it. They are,??
Extremes of age (<1 or > 75 years of age) or elderly frail individuals? ?
	People with impaired immune systems (Cancer patients on chemotherapy, severe diabetics, Chronic Kidney disease sufferers or individuals infected with HIV/AIDS etc.)??
	IV drug users??
	People who have undergone a surgery or an invasive procedure recently??
	A breach of skin integrity??
	Patients with indwelling catheters or IV lines??
?
What are the adverse outcomes of Sepsis?
Sepsis is a potentially life threatening situation and therefore prompt medical attention is an absolute must. Untreated Sepsis could then progress to a stage known as ?Severe Sepsis? where in addition to the signs of Sepsis there are signs of multiple organ dysfunction such as difficulty in breathing, reduced or no urine output, abnormal liver function tests and alterations in mental status. Nearly all patients with Severe Sepsis should be ideally treated in an Intensive Care Unit (ICU). ?Septic Shock? is the most severe form where it is diagnosed when the blood pressure levels drop to very low levels. Usually at this stage medication to increase the blood pressure or ?Inotropes? are used since intravenous fluids do not improve the low blood pressure levels. Most people recover from a mild sepsis, but the mortality rate for septic shock is nearly 50%.??
?
Treatment
Sepsis must be treated as a medical emergency. Therefore the mainstay of management is early detection and immediate treatment. The method of detecting a septic patient in the clinical setup is to first take a comprehensive history from the patient or bystander accompanied with a thorough physical examination. Usually a person with sepsis will have increased lactic acid levels (>4mmol/liter) Apart from assessing the serum lactate levels a venous blood test for full blood count (FBC), blood culture, C-reactive protein levels (CRP) and specific investigations depending upon the focus of the infection- (Chest X-ray during a RTI or a urine full report during a UTI) - will shed more insight.??
Antibiotics are prescribed by the physician based on the type of infection that is causing the illness. The first antibiotics administered are ?broad spectrum? which means they are affective for multiple groups of bacteria until such time the results of a blood culture are available. The medication is usually given intravenously so that there is a rapid and more efficient delivery to the blood system. Sometimes intravenous antibiotics must be commenced as soon as the patient is admitted-within one hour or so. A 2006 study showed that the risk of death from sepsis increases by 7.6% with every passing hour before treatments are commenced.? ?
Intravenous fluids also play a vital role in maintaining the blood pressure of septic patients. Sometimes the patient is admitted to the hospital when they are in septic shock which requires a more rapid introduction of fluid into the system since blood pressure of the individual has dropped dangerously low. And when the blood pressure cannot be maintained by fluids, as I mentioned earlier, a group of medicines termed as ?inotropes? are utilised. Inotropic agents are predominantly catecholamines such as Noradrenaline, Adrenaline and Dobutamine. They function by increasing the force of contraction of the heart. The insertion of a Central Venous catheter can further simplify the process of giving intravenous fluid and antibiotics.? ?
Early detection plays a vital role in prolonging the survival rate of a septic patient. Specialist care must be sought immediately in all suspicious instances especially concerning individuals who are at a greater risk for acquiring sepsis.? ?

Trump warns against doing business with Iran
	
?
US, (The Hindu), AUGUST 08, 2018 -? ?
U.S. President Donald Trump warned countries against doing business with Iran on Tuesday as he hailed the ?most biting sanctions ever imposed?, triggering a mix of anger, fear and defiance in Tehran.??
?The Iran sanctions have officially been cast. These are the most biting sanctions ever imposed, and in November they ratchet up to yet another level,? Mr. Trump wrote in an early morning tweet.??
?Anyone doing business with Iran will NOT be doing business with the United States. I am asking for WORLD PEACE, nothing less.???
Within hours of the sanctions taking effect, German automaker Daimler said it was halting its business activities in Iran.??
In a statement on Monday Trump said ?I remain open to reaching a more comprehensive deal ...??
?
But his Iranian counterpart Hassan Rouhani dismissed the idea of talks while crippling sanctions were in effect. ?If you?re an enemy and you stab the other person with a knife, and then you say you want negotiations, then the first thing you have to do is remove the knife.?? ?
