CRPF sends plastic bullets to Kashmir to reduce use of pellet guns
	

MEERUT, (The Hindu), OCTOBER 07, 2017 - The CRPF has sent 21,000 rounds of newly-developed and less lethal plastic bullets to the Kashmir Valley to tackle street protests, says a top officer of the force. 
The bullets, developed by the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and manufactured by the Ordnance factory based in Pune, can be fitted in the AK series of assault rifles and will be an alternative to the much-criticised pellet shotguns. 
Tests have shown that these plastic bullets are less lethal. This will reduce our dependence on pellet guns and other non-lethal weapons used for crowd control, CRPF Director General (DG) R.R. Bhatnagar told PTI.

Ex-CJ faults AG of misleading Parliament
	
Former Chief Justice Sarath N. Silva today told the Supreme Court that the Attorney General was guilty of misleading Parliament through his opinion on the amendments introduced to the Provincial Councils Amendment Bill during the committee stage of its passage.
Making submissions as a citizen of the country in support of his fundamental rights application in the Supreme Court, he said he was not challenging the Speaker's endorsement but that of the Attorney General's opinion.
He claimed that it had been done in secrecy and that the AG was guilty of misleading Parliament.
Mr. Silva was making his submissions to support the leave to proceed with his FR application before the SC Bench comprising Chief Justice Priyasath Dep, Justices B.P. Aluvihara and Nalin Perera.
He said at the third reading, the original Bill, which was passed at the second reading had been totally ignored and the purported enactments smuggled in at the Committee Stage were approved and thus the Bill passed at the third reading was not the Bill which was passed at the second reading.
Mr. Silva said the Parliament was the depository of the people's legislative power and the Parliament an agent of the people.
He said the Bill should have been passed and endorsed according to the Constitution and Parliament Standing Orders of the Parliament and as such this particular Bill had not been duly passed.
Additional Solicitor General (ASG) Sanjay Rajaratnam appearing for the Attorney General raised three preliminary objections on the maintainability of Sarath N. Silvas FR petition on the grounds of suppression of material facts, no jurisdiction and the Parliamentary Powers and Privileges Act.
He pointed out that the petition did not mention in the threshold caption under which article he was attending Court. He said if it was a FR petition he should seek administrative and executive relief but in his petition he was seeking a declaration from the Court that the Speaker was not empowered by law to certify this Bill, which was passed at the 2nd Reading by Parliament and that the Speaker was prevented by law from endorsing a certificate on such an amended Bill as having been duly passed in Parliament.
The ASG said the petitioner was challenging the validity of the certification by the Speaker and the legislative process.
He said the Bill was certified by the Speaker on September 22, 2017 and the petitioner filed his petition on September 28, 2017 so he has suppressed the material fact and pointed out that the intervenient petitioner M.A. Sumanthiran and the other intervenient petitioners had pleaded that they be heard before the granting of leave to proceed.
Mr. Sumanthiran in his submissions said the Supreme Court has no jurisdiction to hear or issue a determination on the said application.
He said this application could not be entertained as it was matter to do with Parliament where there was the parliamentary powers and privileges Act and cited and judgment delivered by a three-judge Bench one of whom was the then Chief Justice Sarath N. Silva.
In the judgment delivered on Monetary Law (Amendment) Act and Inland Revenue (Special Provisions) Bill, Mr. Sumanthiran said Citizen Silva in this petition, who was the then Chief Justice pronounced that the petitioners were bound by the preclusive Clause and could not invoke the jurisdiction of this Court in respect of the validity of the Acts of Parliament and that the petitioners were seeking to indirectly achieve the result by challenging the Bills which preceded the respective Acts of Parliament.
Mr. Sumanthiran said former Chief Justice had ruled that therefore the petitioners could not circumvent the preclusive Clause as contained in Article 80(3) in respect of the Acts of Parliament by seeking to challenge the validity of the provisions of the Bill which preceded those Acts of Parliament.
Court fixed for October 19 the hearing of further submissions by the intervenient petitioners.
Former Chief Justice Sarath Nanda Silva on September 28, 2017 filed a FR violation petition in the SC challenging the enactment of the Provincial Council Elections Amendment Bill.
The former CJ had named the Attorney General Jayantha Jayasuriya PC, Parliament Speaker Karu Jayasuriya and the Chairman and members of the Elections Commission as respondents charging that at the Committee Stage of enacting the Bill all the operative Clauses of the published Bill passed at the Second Reading of the Bill were deleted and an entirely new set of provisions had been introduced.
It appears that this is a total abuse of the legislative process and a negation of the Rule of Law, the petitioner points out.
The former CJ claims that the AG conveniently washed his hands off from the proceedings at the Committee Stage and passed his responsibility to the Speaker who presided as the Chairman of the Committee.
The petitioner incriminated the Speaker of Parliament that the Bill published in the gazette and placed on Order Paper of the Parliament and passed by Parliament at the Second Reading was mutilated by the deletion of all the operative Clauses at Committee Stage and with copious additions and substantial amendments to the Principal Enactment.

Fresh laws for Reforming State institutes
	
The Government was in the process of evolving fresh legislation to provide for reforming and restructuring the State institutions, a State Minister said yesterday.
State Minister of Finance Eran Wickramaratne told the Daily Mirror that the Government studied models for it available in the countries such as Malaysia and Singapore.
He said the Government was in the preliminary stage of drafting the new legislation titled Public Enterprise Bill.
It is not a matter linked with the upcoming budget. Some institutions will be considered for restructuring and the others for Public Private Partnership. The preliminary draft of the Bill is not yet complete. Once it is done, we will put it for discussion, he said.
Asked whether the State banks would be reformed, he said:
The State banks are not a burden on the Treasury at the moment. They are, more or less, stand alone institutions.
There are around 250 public commercial enterprises in the country.
The State Minister said the State banks only faced the challenging of meeting the demand for capital.
We have to augment their capital, he said. (Kelum Bandara)

Health Engagement 17: US Marine Corps train SL Marine Corps
	
A team of US Marine Corps conducted a two-week medical training to 70 selected Sri Lankan Marine Corps from September 11 to September 21, at the Welisara Naval Base. 
The medical training was aimed at increasing effectiveness when responding to disaster situations and to conduct humanitarian relief programmes. 
US Navy Commander Adolfo Granados, the group surgeon assigned to the 3rd Marine Logistics Group, said the Health Engagement-17 between the Navy Marines of the two nations was of paramount importance. 
This programme helps enhancing partnership between the two nations. Since the Sri Lankan marines passed out only recently, it is important for both countries to understand, what Marine Corps is all about, he said. 
Intractability, he said, was important to the US as they were trying to build partnership in this region. 
"This programme helps enhancing partnership between the two nations. Since the Sri Lankan marines passed out only recently, it is important for both countries to understand, what is Marine Corps, is all about."
US Navy Commander - Adolfo Granados
When we have partner nations like Sri Lanka, we need to understand each of our Marine Corps and how each of our Navy works. So when we come together as partners, we can be more effective in developing partnerships, he said. 
Commenting on the medical response training, Commander Granados said the group of Sri Lankan Sailors and Marines had undergone training well and now they could train their own sailors and marines. 
They have demonstrated quite a mastery of the materials and are teaching very well. Seven members of our team who are here, taught to a group of 20 of Sri Lankan Marine Corps. They are teaching their own members now. What we want to do is expand the training to more Sri Lankan sailors and marines so they can train their own. That way, our intractability with the Lankan Navy will be greater in the years to come, he said. 
"We hope to expand the training in the coming years. We trained 20 Marines who would train others in the future."
Commander T.P. Malalgama

The training included basic life savings and trauma combat care methods. Commander Granados said the training was not only essential for combat situations but any disaster situations as well. 
Sri Lanka had floods recently. So the skills acquired by the Sri Lankan navy sailors could be used for such tougher situations. Learnt skills will help them in any kind of disaster situation and humanitarian relief situations, he said. 
Commander T.P. Malalgama of Sri Lanka Navys Medical Unit said the US training was provided to Sri Lankan Marines belonging to several units, including the Medical and Rapid Deployment Squadron. 
He said the training expected to treat the casualties not only at war conditions but also during emergency disaster situations . 
The first training session with the US, he said was launched in 2015 in Punewa camp as a concept of now Navy Commander. 
Two Indian medical doctors had taken part in the training as observers this year. 
We hope to expand the training in the coming years. We trained 20 Marines who would train others in the future, he said. 
"The Combat Application Tourniquet is one such equipment. We can, in any situation, treat the injured and save lives by preventing blood loss using this device"
Dr. lieutenant Rathnasekara
The Sri Lankan Marines were new to the Navy and the first batch graduated only in February this year. 
Meanwhile, Doctor Lieutenant Rathnasekara, shed insight as to how the training was conducted. 
Mainly, the training was conducted under two phases. Initially, the US marines medical team taught us how to give first aid and respond at battle or disaster situations. 
Under the second phase, we were taught by Special Boat Squad and Medical Battalion Marines. We taught them how to provide first aid as Navy is mostly the first respondent in disaster situations. We can train our Marines to save more people, he said. 
Dr. Rathnasekara said the medical unit, keep updating regularly and the US team was in possession of advanced techniques and equipment. The Combat Application Tourniquet is one such equipment. We can, in any situation, treat the injured and save lives by preventing blood loss using this device, he said.

Hurricane Nate slammed into the US Gulf Coast for the second time in hours early Sunday after leaving a trail of death and destruction in Central America. 
Officials urged residents to evacuate some vulnerable areas before the storm first made landfall on the southeastern tip of Louisiana on Saturday evening, and residents scrambled to make last-minute preparations ahead of the third hurricane to hit the region in less than two months.  Around 1:30 am (0530 GMT), the US National Hurricane Center (NHC) said Nate struck again about five miles (eight kilometers) west of Biloxi, Mississippi, where storm surges caused sea levels to rise dramatically.

Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) General Secretary and MP Udaya Gammanpila today invited MP Dr. Jayampathy Wickramaratne for an open debate in order to clarify some contradictions emerged in the interim report to the proposed New Constitution.
Addressing a news briefing, he stressed that one of the leading members of the Constitutional Steering Committee, Dr. Wickramaratne had misinterpreted the word Unitary.
According to Dr. Wickramaratne the word Unitary means one government but it really conveys not one government but one nation. It is obvious that the incumbent government aims at establishing a federal system of government by which a lot of chaos in the government would be created, Gammanpila said.
He proceeded to convince that exact Tamil translation which suggested the exact meaning of unitary had been cut off in the New Constitution and added the government had begun the coup to form a federal system of government in and through the proposed New Constitution.
I invite Jayampathy Wickramaratne for an open floor to get clarified all these contradictions and present the truth to the people, he added. (Sheain Fernandopulle)

Kabir, Malik should be brought before PCoI: CHR
	
Centre for Human Rights and Research (CHR) Executive Director Keerthi Tennakoon said yesterday State Enterprises Development Minister Kabir Hashim and Minister of Development Strategies and International Trade Malik Samarawickrama, who was said to have participated in the first discussion with regard to the issuance of Central Bank Bonds in 2015, should be summoned before the Presidential Commission of Inquiry (PCoI).
He told a news conference that there was an attempt to suppress the investigation of bond scam by passing the buck to Ravi Karunanayake, who was Finance Minister for the name sake, while Minister Kabir Hashim was the Subject Minister of State Banks and Central Bank was under Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.
He said it was revealed by Committee on Public Enterprises (COPE), audit reports and in the PCoI that the bond scam had begun from a meeting attended by Minister Hashim and Mr. Samarawickrama, who did not have any portfolio at that time but they had not been summoned before the commission so far.
He said the PCoI should give them an opportunity to reveal what they know about the bond issuance.
They may not have involved in the scam but they are the best witnesses to reveal the truth, he said.
Mr. Tennakoon said the commission was appointed to identify the people who were involved in the bond scam not to identify those who purchased houses or initiate business from Arjun Aloysius money.
He said those who were behind the bond scam should not be allowed to get away by hiding behind Ravi Karunanayake.(Ajith Siriwardana)

Litro Gas Chairman arrested
	
Litro Gas Chairman Shalila Moonasinghe was arrested by the Criminal Investigations Department (CID) today in connection with the alleged transferring of USD 1.1 million from Far Eastern International Bank of Taiwan to his personal account in Sri Lanka, CID sources said.
Moonasinghe, who was appointed as the Litro Gas Chairman by the then Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake in 2015, is being interrogated by the CID officials, the sources confirmed.
According to reports, the Far Eastern International Bank of Taiwan was hacked and US$ 60 million was wired to the accounts of several suspects at a bank in Colombo.
The CID earlier launched an investigation into the incident and made the first arrest on Friday.
The first suspect was arrested while attempting to withdraw Rs. 80 million from a local bank account. The first suspect had withdrawn Rs. 30 million from the said bank account on Wednesday too.
The Far Eastern International Bank last week said, through the planted malware, hackers conducted virtual transactions to move funds totaling nearly US$60 million from customers' accounts to destinations such as Sri Lanka, Cambodia and the United States.
Meanwhile, Taiwanese media reported that Taiwan's Criminal Investigation Bureau (CIB) was preparing to send investigators to Sri Lanka to seek further details on the arrest of the suspects accused of helping hackers stealing millions of US dollars from the bank.
On Saturday, Far Eastern Bank said it had recovered most of the stolen money and that its losses would amount to no more than US$500,000.
The bank said it noticed some irregularities in its computerized transaction system on Tuesday and then discovered that some of its computers and servers had been infected with malware.
The Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication's (SWIFT) network was also compromised, which allowed the hackers to wire money to international destinations such as Sri Lanka, Cambodia and the United States, Far Eastern Bank said.
Meanwhile, Colombo Additional Magistrate Jeyaram Trotsky today issued an order to the controller of Immigration and Emigration by proscribing the foreign travels of Shalila Moonasinghe as requested by the CID in connection with the Taiwan bank heist.
As the information has been received that Mr. Moonasinghe, who is a resident of the address 441/12B, 6th lane, Ethul Kotte was attempting to go abroad from Mattala or Katunayake airports after evading arrest without assisting in the investigations relating to this incident, court has issued this order after accepting the request made by the CID.
Earlier, the first suspect Janaka Chaminda Nammuni, a resident of Fairway Apartment on Buthgamuwa road , Rajagiriya was arrested on the allegation leveled against him was getting transferred to his bank account in Sri Lanka a large sum of money belonging to a Taiwan bank.
The CID launched the investigation following a complaint made by Bank of Ceylon about this fraudulent money transaction on October 6.
			Who is Shalila Moonesinghe
			Shalila Moonesinghe, is the leader of the New Democratic Front (NDF) under whose nomination President Maithripala Sirisena won the January 2015 Presidential election under the symbol of the swan. It is currently a constituent partner of the United National Front.

Probe into bank hacking: Taiwan to send CIB team to SL
	
Taiwan's Criminal Investigation Bureau (CIB) said Monday that it was preparing to send investigators to Sri Lanka to seek further details on the reported arrest there of two suspects accused of helping hackers stealing millions of US dollars from a Taiwanese bank, the Taiwan media reported today.
However, due to the fact that Taiwan has no diplomatic ties with Sri Lanka or any government representatives stationed in Sri Lanka, the CIB told CNA, it would take some time to get everything in order for the investigators to go to Sri Lanka.
According to local and regional news reports, Far Eastern International Bank was hacked by means of a computer virus and some US$60 million was wired to the accounts of the suspects at a Sri Lanka bank in the capital Colombo.
Two suspects were arrested last week in Sri Lanka when they tried to withdraw the money, and Sri Lanka police look for a third person, according to the news reports.
"We are looking at some US$1.3 million that had come into three accounts in Sri Lanka," an unnamed Sri Lankan official involved with the investigation was quoted as saying in an AFP report. "We have taken two people into custody, and we are looking for one more person."
On Saturday, Far Eastern Bank said it had recovered most of the stolen money and that its losses would amount to no more than US$500,000.
The bank said it noticed some irregularities in its computerized transaction system on Tuesday and then discovered that some of its computers and servers had been infected with malware.
The Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication's (SWIFT) network was also compromised, which allowed the hackers to wire money to international destinations such as Sri Lanka, Cambodia and the United States, Far Eastern Bank said.
The bank said that on Thursday it reported the matter to Taiwan's Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) and the CIB, which in turn informed the International Criminal Police Organization and asked for assistance.
The FSC said that it was an isolated case in Taiwan and advised that Far Eastern Bank, not its customers, should absorb the losses, the bank said.
Over the weekend, after Premier Lai Ching-te was informed about the case, he asked the relevant agencies to review Taiwan's information security and to close any loopholes, according to Cabinet spokesman Hsu Kuo-yung.

SL fast becoming centre of gravity in world affairs: Ruwan
	
Maritime stakeholders should focus their attention on a greater maritime visibility for enhanced maritime security cooperation with friendly nations, said State Minister of Defence, Ruwan Wijewardene who was the Chief Guest at today's 8th Galle Dialogue.
At this event organized by the Sri Lanka Navy, he said the maritime domain and its affairs have today become one of the crucial factors with the ability to decide and influence the present as well as future affairs to a greater extent.
"Sri Lanka's strategic location in the Indo-Asia Pacific region is fast becoming the centre of gravity in world affairs. With the advantage of the unique position of the Sri Lanka in the Indian Ocean, we are looking at the future with great expectations to regain our maritime glory in the Indian Ocean by promoting mainly trade and tourism," the state minister said. "As no nation is capable of addressing challenges and threats in the maritime domain in isolation, Sri Lanka too seek cooperation and assistance from all nations to ensure that the Indian Ocean is kept free from all threats and challenges."
Navy Commander Vice Admiral Travis Sinniah said despite the many advances made in maritime surveillance and intelligence gathering, the oceans were still exploited for a number of illegal activities both by State and non-State actors.
Delivering the welcome address, he said that it was time to reach a consensus on cooperation among states to share information in creating the finest real time picture of what is happening in the oceans of the world.
In today's economy, the oceans have an increased significance requiring all countries to be able to participate in the global market place. Shipping is the heart of the global economy, but it remains vulnerable. International commerce could be at risk at the key trading hubs as well as at the strategic choke-points, the Navy Commander said
The Commander said the right of vessels to travel freely in international waters, engage in innocent transit passage with access to ports was an essential element of international security.
He said as an Island, Sri Lankas maritime well-being had been vital throughout the nation's history.
We recognize the requirement to establish a common Maritime Domain awareness organization worldwide with an integrated information-sharing grid, aiding in detecting and tackling threats emanating from the sea in real time, the Navy Commander said.
He said this years theme which was Greater Maritime Visibility for Enhanced Maritime Security, focuses on the challenges faced by maritime law enforcement agencies that endeavour to maintain a high degree of surveillance and enhanced maritime domain awareness.
Local and foreign scholars and experts in naval and maritime affairs representing 51 countries including India, China, Japan, Britain and the USA along with 12 international organisations are taking part in this years two-day conference.
Former president Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga, the CDS Admiral Ravindra Wijegunaratne, the Commanders of the Air Force, Army and the IGP Pujith Jayasundara and several senior government and military officials also attended the opening ceremony. (Darshan Sanjeeea)

Taj Mahal: Tear-drop on  the cheek of time
	
The Taj is indeed a flawless gem, a timeless wonder that has inspired many a poet and artiste 
hen a grieving Shah Jahan, the fifth Mughal Emperor, built the timeless wonder of marble as a tribute to his wife Mumtaz Mahal, it was more than just art and architecture- it was a great eulogy to sublime love.
Visiting Agra was by chance. I happened to be in New Delhi for a conference and was able to squeeze in a little time for sightseeing.
As the distance between New Delhi and Agra is around 200 kms it was nearly impossible for anyone to get back by lunch.
But we hired a Taxi and made the journey in the wee-hours of the night to reach Agra by the crack of dawn. There we were hoisting ourselves lazily out of a cramped Alto. It was winter in Delhi - the temperature as low as 4 degrees.
Porters and camel attendants were stirring in their lots, waking up, as we stumbled to the ticket counter that had just opened.
It was too early to get to know the party, and without much questioning the man at the counter issued us tickets at the local rate.
The Taj Mahal (Meaning the Crown of the Palace) is a white-marble mausoleum on the South bank of Yamuna in Agra. It was commissioned in 1632 by the Mughal emperor, Shah Jahan to house the tomb of his beloved wife, Mumtaz Mahal. Described by Nobel laureate Rabindranath Tagore as The tear-drop on the cheek of time the Taj Mahal is universally acclaimed to be one of the Wonders of the World.
The entrance to the Taj Mahal is through a fore-court leading to an imposing red sandstone gateway. Framed by this gateway with calligraphic inscriptions is the beautiful Taj Mahal appearing in the far distance dream-like, a jewel bathed in pink, dazzling and glowing in the soft morning light.
An impressive lush green garden is laid out in the front like a Persian Charbargh, with trees, red sandstone pathways, water channels fountains and a marble pond in the middle.
The water reflects the Taj in all its glory. Seated on a red stone bench right there we photographed ourselves against the beautiful backdrop.

"As the Mughal rulers were passionate about growing flowers it is natural that there is an abundance of flower motifs in the decorations of Taj. Visitors are overwhelmed by the stupendous decorations all around. "
Beyond the garden the Taj Mahal soars to a height of 75 metres, yet appears to be delicate and fragile. The unusual octagonal tomb stands in the middle of a square marble plinth. The four facades of the tomb are flanked by main arches, which are followed by smaller arches.
Also adding to the balance of the tomb are four tall and tapering three-storeyed minarets.
The crowning glory of the Taj is its ingeniously designed bulbous white double dome nestling among four marble cupolas which lie above the central octagonal. Directly under the sheltering dome is the main cenotaph chamber, the heart of the entire monument.
The tomb stone of Mumtaz Mahal lies at the centre of the octagonal hall while that of Shah Jahan is on the right.
Both lay side by side enclosed in bejewelled caskets done in exquisite floral designs inlayed with tiny precious stones. The tombs are enclosed with splendid marble screens, embellished with delicate filigree work giving out a fascinating interplay of light and sparkle into the chamber.
As the Mughal rulers were passionate about growing flowers it is natural that there is an abundance of flower motifs in the decorations of Taj. Visitors are overwhelmed by the stupendous decorations all around.
On either side of the Taj standing in contrast to its white architecture are two red stone structures - one on the right is a mosque, where prayers are offered every evening at sunset. The identical building on the left is a guest house.
The Taj is indeed a flawless gem, a timeless wonder that has inspired many a poet and artiste.
As Tagore said - here on this dusty earth, it keeps death tenderly covered in the shroud of memory

Wedding cancelled after intended bridegroom's wig falls off
	
An incident has been reported from a village near Ma-Oya in which the true nature of the would-be bridegroom had been discovered as a result of his wig coming off and falling at the feet of his father-in-law to be. That of course put paid to his chances of marrying his intended bride.
According to a marriage proposal arranged through a match maker, there were ten relatives who came from the Rajarata area including the parents of the bridegroom to be. They were warmly welcomed by the family of the bride-to-be including her parents and kith and kin, where they were served sweetmeats and betel as was the custom. After both sides got to know each other, a decision was reached to set a date for the wedding.
All was going to plan when the unthinkable happened. While in the act of bending down to touch the feet of his intended father-in-law, as was the tradition, the intended bridegroom's hair (which everyone thought was real) fell off and it was then that it dawned on the shocked onlookers, including the bride's father, that he was in fact wearing a wig. After picking up the fallen hair-piece and realising the deception that might have taken place as well as the effect it would have had on his daughter, the brides father handed it over to his intended son-in-law and requested him to leave his home taking his family along with him. He had a last piece of advice to share with the 'deceiver'. He told him to make very sure that his hair-piece was stuck firmly to his head when he went to visit a prospective wife in future.
In the meantime, the family and relatives of the bridegroom made a hasty retreat after getting into the vehicle they had arrived in. These are good lessons for everybody, this is why it is said that the lifetime of lies is very short, said the intended bride who was embarrassed by the events that had taken place.
