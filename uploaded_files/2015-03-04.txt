A gem of wisdom from a sadder, but wiser deposed Boss
	
	The deposed Big Boss recently visited the Sacred City in the Deep South to attend a special Pooja at the Devalaya.
He was accompanied by a small group of supporters including the ex-Green man from Kesbewa and the Western council member of `double-cross? fame.
On arrival in the Sacred City, deposed Big Boss found to his dismay that of all the provincial politicos, only the Pradeshiya Sabha chairman had turned up to receive him. What was worse was the gate at the entrance to the drive leading to the Maha Devalaya was closed. There was a general hustle to push open the gate and on finding it locked up,some Devalaya employees dashed away to bring the keys.
However, deposed Big Boss took a walk up to the Devalaya without waiting for the gate to be opened for his vehicle.
The special pooja over, the deposed Big Boss stepped out of the Devalaya to find a knot of? people waiting outside to greet him.
The deposed Big Boss with an arm round the Pradeshiya Sabha chairman?s shoulder addressed the small crowd of well-wishers: ?I hope you all may have realized today how good our people are at worshipping the rising Sun and turning their back on the setting Sun.?
He left the place after making that wisecrack.

A mad scramble for top ?Nilame? post
	
	
	The election of a new lay custodian for the main Devalaya in the Deep South is in the offing and about 20 aspirants are already in the running, they say.
Gratifications on offer to those who have a say in the election, range from super limousines to all expenses-paid jaunts to a wide choice of foreign destinations. This position over the years has become more coveted than a high political office and the ongoing mad scramble for it is such that the much revered Deity of Ruhuna should be watching it with a sense of shame, a Devalaya source remarked.
A wealthy politico hailing from the Ampara area is said to be throwing his money left and right in the bid to become the next lay custodian of the Devalaya.? However, a group of Buddhist monks has already begun a campaign to promote the opinion that a strictly apolitical candidate should be considered for election to this office.
Meanwhile, certain VIPs in the Moneragala district have taken up the position that this ?Nilame? office is a 40-year long ?legacy? of the people of their district and they are determined not to allow an ?outsider? to grab it this time round.
However, there is a rumour abuzz that a certain candidate said to be acceptable to all interested parties has already been groomed and he is being kept incognito until the right time. And the candidates out in the open are said to be highly disconcerted over this rumour. There is a certain politico in Moneragala who is said to be privy to the move to keep the particular candidate under cover, but he is mum about it, they say.

UPFA wants electoral reforms with executive powers pruned
	
	The United People?s Freedom Alliance (UPFA) wants the Government to enact legislation to prune powers of the executive presidency and introduce electoral reforms simultaneously because piecemeal amendments would be counterproductive, the UPFA said today.
	UPFA General Secretary Susil Premajayantha said the UPFA would fully support the envisaged Constitutional Amendments and wouldn?t mind even if it took more than 100 days to do so.
	He said the UPFA wanted certain powers to remain with the executive with one of the main constitutional arrangements being the 13th Amendment to the Constitution.
	?The powers to dissolve a Provincial Council under section 154/ 4 of the Constitution must remain with the Executive and he or she must be the supreme commander of the armed forces,? Mr. Premajayantha said. ?It was because of this power vested with the Executive, that President R. Premadasa dissolved the Eastern Provincial Council in March 1990, when Chief Minister Vardharaja Perumal declared Unilateral Independence in the East.?
	Mr. Premajayantha, who is also Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) National Organiser commenting on the unseating of the UPFA Uva Chief Minister said the hand of friendship and cooperation extended by the UPFA to the United National Party (UNP) to form a government has been rejected by replacing the Chief Minister with a Chief Minister from the UNP.
	He said the acceptance of four affidavits declaring support to the UNP by UPFA members was wrong and against the provisions of the Constitution. ?
	Mr. Premajayantha said the UPFA; the largest political party in Parliament with 138 members supported the UNP which had only 49 members to form a government to fulfill the pledges given during the presidential election campaign and complete the 100-day programme.
	He said covert attempts were being made to effect a chief ministerial change in the Central Province and pointed out that such acts disrupt the smooth functioning of Provincial Councils thus affecting vital services like education and public administration. (Sandun A Jayasekera)

Ex-ethanol baron finds a new patron!
	
	
	One of the main promises held out by the ruling national unity coalition when they were campaigning on ?a good governance? platform was to eliminate the drug and ethanol mafia in the country for good.
A certain leading businessman in the city during the previous regime imported ethanol shipments under tax concessions for the purported purpose of producing Eau-de-cologne and syphoned off massive stocks of the stuff for the manufacture of Kasippu. The man is said to have made enough filthy lucre byusing ethanol to adulterate even brandy and whiskey as well.? When the lid on the racket was blown off, the authorities at the time removed the tax concessions and the businessman hadto cry halt to his operations.
This ethanol baron incidentally having strong ties to the mass media is planning to resume the lucrative racket he had to abandon, they say.
Our man was seen recently hanging around a certain Ministry. His visit was not in vain.? He met the powerful politico at the place and left the Ministry premises shortly afterwards armed with a new permit to import ethanol for the specific purpose of manufacturing Eau-de-cologne!

?True, I too am a member of the Rajapaksa family,? he told the group of party seniors. ?But please don?t treat me as a party to all misdeeds committed by the other Rajapaksas.?

	It is now a public secret that the former Madam left the country in a huff taking offense at being elected to a high office in the Blue party on par with the deposed Big Boss and a few other seniors.
A story making rounds in the Blue party says that she had yet another reason for her abrupt departure for her second home abroad: the summary dismissal by the New Big Boss of a serious proposal made to him by her.
The former Madam had handed to the new Big Boss a list of party ?black sheep?saying that they should not be given the party ticket to contest the general elections in the offing. However, the New Big Boss had said: ?It is not fair to reject any of our party members just because there are allegations against them. We should not hold old grudges against people either. After all, everyone is presumed innocent, until proven guilty in a court of law.? ?
This response had got her goat and she had gone into a harangue on how hard she worked to enthrone the new regime. ?You may sink or swim ? I don?t care hereafter,? had been her parting words.

	The Prime Minister who responded said Maldives was considered a part of Sri Lanka and same practices may have been followed in both countries in this situation.
	Mr. Dissanayake alleged that metal had been transported to the Maldives violating the environment laws. Mr. Wickremasinghe who responded said transporting metal violating laws was nothing compared to the amount of money taken out of the country violating currency laws.

The Central Committee of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) has ruled that its people?s representatives should not attend any rallies organised by other political parties without the approval of the SLFP -- as it was the responsibility of the party members to rally round the party.

The statement also said that all of the party?s people?s representatives had been given opportunities to participate in media briefings organised by the party.
Mr. Yapa said the SLFP Central Committee presided over by president Maitripala Sirisena? had decided to reorganise all the organisations of the party and organisations affiliated to it after the appointment of new office bearers of the party to prepare for the upcoming general election.
He said the objective of the party was to obtain a in parliament together with the other parties that had already been in the alliance, with a new vision -- and added that certain regressive forces were acting to weaken this programme.

The operation to oust Western Provincial Chief runs into a snag
	
	An operation to oust the incumbent Western Provincial Chief has got underway. A minister at cabinet level who shed much sweat to usher in the ?compassionate? regime is reportedly at the helm of this operation.
A Blue member of the council with requisite qualifications to replace the current Chief has already been picked. He has also been appointed to the party?s Central Committee by way of grooming him for the high position. But a snag is in the way: a large majority of Blue members dislike the proposed successor.
Meanwhile, on being wise to the machinations aimed at ousting him, the incumbent Chief has already obtained affidavits from 52 members out of the 56 in the ruling party affirming their allegiance to him as the Provincial Chief. In the face of this new challenge,? those behind the operation to oust the Chief,? have now begun a campaign to meet all the 52 provincial members of the three districts one by one to persuade them to withdraw the affidavits and support the proposed successor.
By the way, the current Western Provincial Chief incurred the displeasure of the Blue hierarchy when he along with 42 provincial members attended the Nugegoda rally in defiance of a party directive.

The mother complained that the school principal had failed to provide adequate lifesaving equipment or personnel within the premises or vicinity of the swimming pool and that neither were there any life guards on duty under the supervision of the school principal, who is the first defendant. The mother and son maintained that the scant and callous disregard for the safety of students were acts of gross negligence and of negligent omission by the school principal.
She also learnt that her son was not administered adequate first aid nor promptly taken to hospital and that there were no ambulances or medical personnel on standby at the camp in case of any such emergency, nor were there any vehicles to rush her son, who was in a critical condition, to a hospital for urgent medical attention.
The mother said her son was in an unstable and critical condition for more than three months and treated at the National Hospital and thereafter to date was receiving treatment at the Rheumatology and Rehabilitation Hospital in Ragama, but with very little improvement.
She said her son has been in a coma and in a permanent vegetative state from the day of the incident and is being fed a liquid diet through tubes. The mother said her son had been suffering immense pain has lost all hope of a useful life. His life expectancy has diminished significantly and is expected to receive medical assistance throughout his life.
She said she had to spend a large amount of money in caring for the child and would continue to need a more funds for his care in the future.
The mother said it was more than a year since the incident but no action has been taken by the principal or the school to support her and her son in any manner or to provide relief financial or otherwise to ease the huge burden she had to carry because of the injuries suffered by her son. She said that in September 2013, attempts were made by her to seek assistance from the principal but he had refused to discuss the matter any further.(Lakmal Sooriyagoda)

Thousand public locations to get free Wi-Fi
	
	The Information and Communications Technology Agency (ICTA), which implements the government?s ICT policies, will be launching the ?Free Wi-Fi? project in partnership with all telecommunication operators, in the coming months, to let citizens have further accessibility to information and participate in e-governance.
	?Thousand public locations will get Wi-Fi free of charge. This has been finalized. It is not a plan or a promise, because some said it is not economically possible or it was a ploy to get young votes,? Foreign Affairs Deputy Minister Ajith Perera, under whom the ICT sector falls, said.
	He noted that access to information is no longer a luxury but a critical need, similar to access to water, electricity and telephones used by youngsters in rural villages up to top corporates.
	?This will open up new employment opportunities and new markets may appear,? Perera said.
	ICTA CEO Muhunthan Canagey said that the citizens would be able to vote on the e-government and ICT initiatives being developed by the ICTA and allow them to engage with the government on policy planning.
	?This is the first time the public has been going to be able to engage in policymaking with the government and be closer to the government.?
	The access points would be fixed at locations of importance, such as universities, public parks, libraries and highly frequented railway stations and bus stops.
	?We are going to implement at 250 locations within the 100-day programme and the rest to follow within two to three months. But our dreams go beyond these 1,000. We want free Wi-Fi to be available everywhere in the country,? Perera said.
	Recently, Sri Lankan-born Silicon Valley technologist Chamath Palihapitiya called on President Maithripala Sirisena pitching a concept of low orbiting geo synchronized satellites to provide free islandwide Internet access, capitalizing on Sri Lanka?s location close to the equator. The president had given his blessing to explore the opportunities. (Chandeepa Wettasinghe)

What to look for when purchasing a life insurance policy, courtesy Janashakthi
	
		 		 
		 
			
Whether fresh out of school or ready to settle down and start a family, it?s important to plan for the future. At this stage in life, insurance is rarely at the top of anyone?s priority list. Life insurance is an important safety net which can keep both you and your loved ones safe and yet not many people know what to look out for when choosing a life insurance policy.
?Janashakthi Insurance has consistently been a first mover in the life insurance segment. Over our 20 years of existence, we have created tailor-made plans for our customers, following extensive research and development. In doing so, we have an intuitive understanding of what people need to be aware of when signing up for a life insurance policy and the common mistakes to avoid,? said Janashakthi Insurance General Manager Life Sales and Operations Hashra Weerawardena.
1.It?s never too early to
start saving
?? ?Many people consider signing up for life insurance at a later stage in life. However, it?s important to sign up for a policy as early as possible, in order to benefit from better premium rates. This is because a young, healthy policyholder, you would be considered a lower risk to the insurance company and so would benefit from better premiums. This would also allow for an adequate safety net in an emergency. A range of life insurance policies (which can double as savings plans) are available for people as young as 18 or 19 years.
2.Always allow for inflation
?? ?Year on year, the cost of living goes up and this needs to be taken into account when signing up for a policy. Keep an eye out for insurance policies that offer enhanced protection against inflation.
3.Check for policy extensions and added benefits
?? ?Insurance policies can often be extended to offer additional protection in the event of disability or accidents, with additional payments several times the basic cover. It is important to learn about the options available to you, in the event of hospitalisation and disability or critical illness, for instance, at the time of signing up for a policy. This ensures that you are prepared for any eventuality.
?? ?Policies can also often be extended to cover immediate family, such as a spouse or children. In addition, check for family income benefits, which can accrue to immediate family members as a fixed monthly income. Other things to watch out for include any benefits payable on the date of maturity of the policy. Not only does this ensure you have a safety net in an emergency, a policy can also give you added benefits which can improve your lifestyle.
4.Don?t budget too low
?? ?Ensure that the premium you pay is in accordance with your lifestyle. Always provide comprehensive information about previous illness or surgery when filling in your proposed information, as this will lead to a more accurate premium payment, which will provide better coverage in the event of an unfortunate incident.
5.Don?t just consider your needs
?? ?When considering a life insurance policy, it?s important to take your family?s lifestyle and needs into consideration, not just your own. This will lead to a more accurate picture of your budget, which in turn will allow you to better provide for your family.

The second, his or her? vision should be poor and if he or she? suffers from dementia it would an added qualification and the third carries more weight than the first and the second qualifications: he or she? should move about on a wheel chair.
