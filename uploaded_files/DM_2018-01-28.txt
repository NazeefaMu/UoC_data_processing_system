ICC sanctions Danushka, Mashrafe for misconduct
	
Bangladesh captainMashrafe Mortaza and Sri Lanka opener DanushkaGunathilaka have been found guilty of breaching Article 2.1.7 in two separate incidents during the tri-series final in Mirpur on Saturday, the ICC said today.
In a statement, it said Mortaza has been fined 20 per cent of his match fee while Gunathilaka has received an official reprimand for breaching Level 1 of the ICC Code of Conduct during the final of the tri-series.
Both the players were found to have breached Article 2.1.7 of the ICC Code of Conduct for Players and Player Support Personnel, which relates to using language, actions or gestures which disparage or which could provoke an aggressive reaction from a batsman upon his/her dismissal during an International Match,it said.
In addition to this, one demerit point each has been added to the disciplinary records of the two players.
The statement said while this was Gunathilakas first offence, Mashrafe has been sanctioned for the second time since the introduction of the revised Code in September 2016.
He had received one demerit point for breaching Article 2.1.7 in the ODI series against England on 10 October 2016. As such, he now has two demerit points against his name.
The incident involving Mashrafe happened in Sri Lankas sixth over when the captain ran close to Kusal Mendis after he fell to Mehidy Hasan while yelling loudly and looking directly at the opener in a manner that could have provoked an aggressive reaction.
The incident involving Gunathilaka happened in the sixth over of Bangladeshs innings when, following the dismissal of Tamim Iqbal, he yelled loudly at the departing batsman which prompted the opener to react by turning to face him.
Both the players admitted the offences and accepted the sanctions proposed by David Boon of the Emirates Elite Panel of ICC Match Referees and, as such, there was no need for a formal hearing.
The charges were levelled by on-field umpires Chettithody Shamshuddin and Sharfuddoula, third umpire Bruce Oxenford and fourth umpire Anisur Rahman.
Level 1 breaches carry a minimum penalty of an official reprimand, a maximum penalty of 50 per cent of a players match fee, and one or two demerit points.

Karnataka man arrested for sexually assaulting Lankan minor
	
In a shocking case of child sexual abuse, a Karnataka man has been arrested for luring a Sri Lankan minor to India on the promise of a modelling career, and sexually assaulting her and looting Rs 2 lakh from her and her mother.
The man  Satish  the son of a Haveri based businessman, has been booked under relevant sections of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, Indian media reported.
The minor and her mother have now returned to Sri Lanka after their nightmarish experience.
When Mallika(not her real name) began talking to Bengaluru-based Satish in 2015, the Sri Lanka-based girl thought she finally had a chance at a better life.
Only 12 at the time, the young girl believed Satish when he told her, after seeing her photos on Facebook, that she had a career in modeling. And Satish offered to get her a gig himself  he said he had contacts in Bollywood.
On November 28, 2017, Mallikas mother arranged for Rs 2 lakh and the mother-daughter duo flew to India to meet Satish.
The duo met Satish on December 1, after which he told them to stay at a hotel in Andheri, Mumbai.
That afternoon, Satish called Mallika to his room. He offered her some juice, after which, Mallika says in her statement, she fell unconscious. When she woke up a few hours later, experiencing severe pain in her lower abdomen, she realised she had been sexually assaulted.
While Mallika and her mother were grappling with what had happened, Satish took them to Haveri in Karnataka, and then brought them to Bengaluru.
According to a report, Satish allegedly tried to push Mallika into flesh trade and had lodged her and her mother at a hotel in Bengaluru against their wishes.
On December 7, the two of them were made to board a Mumbai-bound bus. Satish had stepped down to buy tea and didnt return.
When he didnt return, we realised that he had disappeared with our money, Mallikas mother said.
Mallika and her mother then approached the Upparpet police. The police swung into action quickly and arrested Satish.
After the arrest, Mallika and her mother were sent to an NGO for counseling and have now been sent back to Sri Lanka.
The police said that they are waiting for the forensic report before filing the chargesheet. Satish has confessed that he duped the child for sex and trafficking, and did not expect the mother to come along, a senior officer said.

UNP Deputy Minister Ajith P. Perera said today in case President Maithripala Sirisena intended to form a government with 96 MPs of UPFA, he would have to conduct the governments group meeting only in the Buddhist realm of hell known as Avici.
He made these comments in reply to a point made by the President that those who engaged in corruption and fraud would be condemned to Avici, which is the lowest level of Naraka or the hell realm, according to Buddhist canons.
Addressing a press conference, Mr. Perera pointed out that if this were the case the President himself would be compelled to go to Avici for the conduct of the governments group meeting if he was able to form a government with 96 members of his own party as he vowed to do,at an election rally held in Ratnapura on Saturday (27).

SL a strategic partner in South Asia: Qatar
	
For Qatar, Sri Lanka is a strategic partner in South Asia, Vice Chairman of Qatars Chamber of Commerce and Industry Mohammed Bin Ahmed Bin Towar Al Kuwari has said.
According to 'The Peninsula', he had expressed these views at an event held recently under the theme Employment Promotion in Qatar which was organised by the Sri Lankan Embassy in collaboration with Qatar Chamber.
Al Kuwari said both countries have signed various agreements and memorandum of understandings to enhance economic relations.
However, what has been achieved so far does not reflect the potential both the countries have. Their trade volume reached $73m last year which doesnt correspond to vast opportunities available in both countries, he said.
On behalf of Qatar Chamber, I would like to invite more Sri Lankan companies to take part in renaissance taking place in Qatar and establish joint ventures with Qataris in all sectors. We also urge Qatari businessmen to explore the investment opportunities galore in Sri Lanka and establish business partnerships and alliances with their Sri Lankan counterparts, Al Kuwari said.
He said the relations between Qatar and Sri Lanka reflected in the presence of a large number of Sri Lankan expatriates contributing to the development of Qatar.
Qatar Chamber highly welcomes more skilled workers and employees from Sri Lanka to work in the mega projects being implemented for developing the infrastructure and for the 2022 FIFA World Cup. I would also like to take this opportunity to call on Qatari businessmen to give more jobs to skilled Sri Lankans in their businesses, he added.
Al Kuwari also stressed the need for more space for trade and investment opportunities between Qatar and Sri Lanka.
Sri Lankan Ambassador to Qatar A.S.P. Liyanage, Qatars Administrative Development Ministrys Employment Department Director Fawaz Mohammed Al Rayes, Deputy General Manager (Marketing & Recruitment) of Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment D.D.P. Senanayake and licensed foreign employment agents of Sri Lanka also attended the event.
