Avant Garde case: Defence submits Preliminary Objection
	
The defence yesterday submitted their written preliminary objection before court into the case questioning the maintainability of the inquiry, where former Defence Secretary and six others were accused of corruption charges in connection with the Avant Garde Maritime Services by the Bribery Commission.
The Bribery Commission alleged that the suspects, former Defence Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa, Nissanka Senadhipathi and six others had committed the offence by permitting the Avant Garde Maritime Services to operate a floating AGMS to earn Rs. 11.4 billion incurring a financial loss to the State.
The six suspects are Sujatha Damayanthi, Palitha Piyasiri Fernando, Karunaratne Bandara Adhikarai, Somathilaka Dissanayake, Jayanath Sirikumara Colambage and Jayantha Perera.
Subsequently, Colombo Chief Magistrate Lal Ranasinghe Bandara directed the prosecution to tender their counter objection on the matter within two weeks. The case was put off for May 29.
Earlier, raising an oral preliminary objection at the onset, Romesh de Silva PC moved that the prosecution had violated the law vested in the Bribery Act when bringing charges against the suspects.
He said when purported charges were brought in before court under Section 70 (Corruption), the prosecution should obtain a mandatory sanction, a written consent, from the Bribery Commission according to the section 78 (1) of the Bribery Act. However, in this case there was no such sanction visible in court, therefore, the proceedings of the case should not be continued, and straight away be discharged the suspects from the inquiry.
According to the Senior State Counsel Janaka Bandara who argued against saying that under Section 11 of the No. 19, 1994 Bribery Act, the Director General of the Bribery Commission is permitted to file charges in court with the direction of the Commission, and no certification of the commission is required in court because the direction is sufficient compliance.
However, Mr. de Silva contended that the section 78(1), which requires a sanction from the Commission, was brought in under the No. 20, 1994 Bribery Act, which passed after the No. 19 Act, thereby, the Mandatory sanction requirement is in force after the new inclusion.
But the State Counsel further elaborated and argued that there was a Supreme Court decision pertaining to a similar dispute which held that the Bribery Director is allowed to file charges with sufficient compliance of the authority of the Commission under section 11 of No.19, 1994 Bribery Act.

Britain's Queen signs Brexit bill into law
	
The Queen has given Royal Assent to the Brexit bill, clearing the way for Theresa May to start talks to leave the European Union.
The European Union (Notification of Withdrawal) Bill was passed by MPs and peers on Monday.
It allows the prime minister to notify Brussels that the UK is leaving the EU, with a two year process of exit negotiations to follow.
Mrs May says she will trigger the process by the end of the month.
It is unlikely to happen next week to avoid a clash with an informal summit of EU countries.
The meeting will mark the 60th anniversary of the Treaties of Rome, which established the European Economic Community, and in turn became the European Union.(BBC)

Development assistance by Korea Exim Bank to increase by $ 300 M
	
Development assistance by the Korea Exim Bank Economic Development Cooperation Fund (EDCF) to Sri Lanka will increase by US$ 300 million to 500 million over the next three years, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said yesterday.
At a media briefing held in Colombo, Foreign Affairs Minister Mangala Samaraweera said the Korean government would also provide US$ 200,000 in kind, as humanitarian assistance for drought relief.
Marking four decades of diplomatic relations with the visiting foreign minister of the Republic of Korea, Yun Byung-se, the two countries signed an MoU on Cooperation between the Bandaranaike International Diplomatic Training Institute of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Sri Lanka (BIDTI) and the Korean National Diplomatic Academy (KNDA) of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Korea.
I welcome this MoU which opens a new chapter of mutual cooperation between our two diplomatic academies in training our diplomats, said Samaraweera.
Celebrating four decades of diplomatic relations between the countries, discussions were also held on ways and means of further enhancing bilateral cooperation in areas of mutual interest, including political relations, economic cooperation, development cooperation, labour relations, defence and cultural cooperation, as well as cooperation in regional and multilateral fora.
"Particular attention was paid to ways and means of further strengthening our bilateral trade and investment partnership, as well as the ongoing collaboration on the Megapolis and Western Development Plan," the minister said.
Commenting on the situation in the Korean peninsula and regional security issues, Samaraweera called upon the DPRK to abide by its international obligations, ensuring an environment conducive to peace and security. Visiting foreign minister Yun Byung-se was deeply appreciative of Sri Lankas stance on the matter.
The ministers visit is the first official visit by a Korean foreign minister since 1986. A logo was launched to celebrate 40 years of diplomatic relations between the two countries. (Nabeela Hussain)

## Title: Do you know him

Do you know him
	
History testifies he was the best of mankind. The seal of Prophethood, the last and final messenger of God. He was sent as a mercy to the entire universe. This man, Muhammad, have you heard of him On that Day of Judgment, when man will be judged according to his deeds, he will beg and cry for you, seeking mercy from the Creator. Tell me, should you not know him
Words of God recorded in the Quran (His message to mankind) describe the nobleness of the last and final Prophet, Muhammad. Unaltered for the last 1,400 years, the Quran reveals Prophet Muhammad is the seal of Prophethood -- some of his predecessors in the chain of Prophethood Adam, Noah, Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac, Moses, Yousuf, Jacob, Jesus (Peace be upon them) are mentioned in the Quran.
The acknowledgement of this noble human being by non-Muslims is indeed justifiable testimony to the above declaration by God Himself. A gift to the whole of mankind, not to the Muslims only. Prophet Muhammad (Peace be upon him) said:
Irrespective of the religion, your neighbour should not face any inconvenience because of you. Pay a kind visit to your neighbour before going to the festival Eid prayer. If you eat when your neighbour is in hunger, then you are not a true Muslim. Add a little more water to your meat curry and send it to your neighbour as a kind gesture, there is no upper or lower class; all humans are equal and have the right to pray and eat together. Do not worship means or mediators, rather worship the one who created and empowered them. Extend a helping hand to the poor and the needy, and do not take interest.
He taught us to pay the exact remuneration to the labourer before his or her sweat went dry. He conquered and still continues to do so, the hearts and minds of billions of people across the world. The religion of peace taught to him by the Creator is self-sufficient and encompasses every aspect of life.
Islam has provision for health, engineering, law, agriculture, administration, marriage and military, to name a few. Those who follow him are not merely from his tribe and land, but from the four corners of the globe. Significantly, 56 countries with a staggering 2 billion followers (and growing), a quarter of humanity, are Islamic.
His inability to read or write the message in the holy Quran sent to him by the Almighty perplexes even the modern-day scientists. In his remarkable character and the Quran by the creator of humanity lies the answer to all the baffling queries of mankind.
Mahatma Gandhi in a statement to Young India stated that it was not the sword that spreads Islam but the passion, courage and faith of Prophet Muhammad to God. The three raging battles during the Prophets time were all defensive when the infidels attacked Madinah where the Prophet and followers entered after facing 13 years of persecution in Mecca. But Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) and his followers succeeded in conquering Mecca without bloodshed.
He was not solely the final messenger of God or the greatest religious leader of all times, but also a military headman who skunked two world superpowers -- the Romans and the Persians. His life would have certainly prompted non-Muslim Michael Hart, in his book titled The 100, A ranking of the most influential persons in history, to place Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) on number one.
Prominent Hindu scholar Swami Lakshmi Shankaracharya said if one was to judge Islam, it was necessary that he or she studied the lifestyle and teachings of Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) thoroughly. It is truly interesting to note that he was very critical about Islam but upon studying it through original sources, concluded that Muslims were enjoined to fight in self-defence to establish peace, and not resorting to terror.
Arnoud Van Doorn, a former member of the PVV Party in the Netherlands, who made the anti-Islamic film Fitna against the Prophet, decided to study the Quran and the lifestyle of the Prophet after witnessing the overwhelming responses by Muslims. After performing Hajj, he apologised for the hatred spread against the peaceful faith and embraced Islam with the pledge of producing a film in honour of Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) titled Muhammad, the Master of Mankind. He affirmed that the West-originated Islamophobia was largely due to media propaganda, and that governments painted a dark image about the religion thereby concealing its originality and peaceful, humane and nonviolent teachings.
The last and final Prophet of the One God, at all times advised people on good manners and character. In one instance, when Muaadh ibn Jabal was sent to Yemen as Governor, the Prophet advised him to perfect his character which would lead people to love and respect him. His personal appeal and gentle approach won the hearts of all people, even his foes. He taught us that the most perfect believer of faith was the one whose character was finest and who was the kindest to his wife, the best amongst us were those who did not harm others with their tongues and hands, the nearest to him on the Day of Judgment would be those with the best of character, that a Muslim cannot be a liar, and that the strongest would be those who controlled their rage.
He was a sincere and loving husband who attended to household chores, a loving father who would play with children and shorten the congregation prayer when he heard children cry, a good master where his servant preferred to serve him rather than going to his father, an honest and truthful businessman who made even his enemies in Mecca entrust their valuables to him until their return. He was a great leader and a warrior too, who never rested when the companions toiled, who treated everyone with equality and respect; everyone loved him. He is the most beloved and righteous servant to his Lord, praying for long hours in the night alone but shortened his prayer in congregation, knowing that the old, sick, feeble and those who had to attend to various responsibilities were there. He was generous to the poor and the needy, and fasted on Mondays and Fridays and on the 13th, 14th and 15th of every month apart from the holy month of Ramadan. Who else could ever be as successful as a worldly and spiritual leader
George Bernard Shaw said: I believe if a man like him were to assume the dictatorship of the modern world he would succeed in solving its problems in a way that brings the much needed peace and happiness. I have studied him, far from being an anti-Christ he should be called the saviour of humanity. I have prophesied about the faith of Muhammad that it would be acceptable to the Europe of tomorrow as it is beginning to be acceptable to the Europe of today.
His passion for all human beings was boundless that he wept at night in prayer, supplicating for the future generations whom he would not meet in this world. Tell me, is it not an honour to have him as part of the human race

Federal judge blocks Trump's new travel ban
	
A federal judge in Hawaii blocked President Donald Trump's new travel ban on Wednesday afternoon, hours before the ban was set to go into effect.
In a 43-page ruling, US District Court Judge Derrick Watson concluded in no uncertain terms that the new executive order failed to pass legal muster at this stage and the state had established "a strong likelihood of success" on their claims of religious discrimination.
Trump decried the ruling during a rally Wednesday night in Nashville, introducing his statement as "the bad, the sad news."
"The order he blocked was a watered-down version of the first one," Trump said, as the crowd booed the news.
"This is, in the opinion of many, an unprecedented judicial overreach," he added, before pledging to take the issue to the Supreme Court if necessary.
The practical effect of the ruling -- which applies nationwide -- is that travelers from six Muslim-majority countries and refugees will be able to travel to the US.
Unlike the previous executive order, the new one removed Iraq from the list of banned countries, exempted those with green cards and visas and removed a provision that arguably prioritizes certain religious minorities.
The new ban was announced earlier this month and was set to take effect Thursday. It would have banned people from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen from entering the US for 90 days and all refugees for 120 days.
"The illogic of the Government's contentions is palpable. The notion that one can demonstrate animus toward any group of people only by targeting all of them at once is fundamentally flawed," Watson wrote.
"Equally flawed is the notion that the Executive Order cannot be found to have targeted Islam because it applies to all individuals in the six referenced countries," Watson added. "It is undisputed, using the primary source upon which the Government itself relies, that these six countries have overwhelmingly Muslim populations that range from 90.7% to 99.8%."
"It would therefore be no paradigmatic leap to conclude that targeting these countries likewise targets Islam," Watson added. "Certainly, it would be inappropriate to conclude, as the Government does, that it does not."
"When considered alongside the constitutional injuries and harms ... and the questionable evidence supporting the Government's national security motivations, the balance of equities and public interests justify granting the Plaintiffs' (request to block the new order)," Watson wrote.
The Justice Department said it will defend the new travel ban.
"The Department of Justice strongly disagrees with the federal district court's ruling, which is flawed both in reasoning and in scope. The President's Executive Order falls squarely within his lawful authority in seeking to protect our Nation's security, and the Department will continue to defend this Executive Order in the courts," DOJ said in a statement Wednesday night.

Full Face helmet ban: CMA complains to HRCSL
	
The Ceylon Motorcyclists Association (CMA) today complained to the Sri Lanka Human Rights Commission (SLHRC) stating that the gazette notice 2007/39 was a violation of human rights restricting a motorcyclist's right to safety.
As such it requested the HRC to nullify the gazette notice issued by Transport and Highways Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva.
In the complaint, the CMA cited the minister, Department of the Registration of Motor Vehicles (RMV) Assistant Commissioner J.A.S Jayaweera, National Council for Road Safety Chairman Dr. Sisira Kodagoda and Police Traffic Division DIG Palitha Fernando as the respondents.
CMA Secretary Chirantha Amarasinghe said the HRC officials accepted the fact that there had been a violation of Human Rights because while issuing the gazette notice, the subject minister had failed to consider Sri Lanka to be a democratic State.
"People have a right to mind their own security. It has left the motorcyclists in the lurch because they have been denied the right to select a helmet of their choice, he said.
Mr. Amarasinghe said Clause 7 in the gazette notice made it mandatory for motorcyclists to wear only SLS-standard helmets, and that only a limited number of such helmets were available in the market.
The CMA has also complained to the UN International Children's Emergency Fund (UNICEF) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) citing the threats posed to riders and pillion riders by the gazette notice.(Thilanka Kanakarathna)

Govt. cant bring in foreign judges under existing constitution: Mangala
	
The government could not only bring in foreign judicial officers under the existing constitution but they were also looking at all their options where the recommendation of the UNHRC was concerned, Foreign Minister Mangala Samaraweera said today.
Speaking at a press briefing in Colombo this evening, Samaraweera neither confirmed nor denied the inclusion of foreign judicial officers in the judicial process of the country.
However, he pointed out that the inclusion of such officers were in fact just a recommendation made by the international community when drafting the resolution.
The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Zeid Ra'ad al Hussein himself had admitted to the same and stated that there could be variations on how the recommendations of the resolution were implemented.
As a sovereign nation we are entitled to look at all options. We cannot bring in foreign judicial officers under the existing constitution, but we are exploring all our options, the minister said.
Stating that the resolution that is once more to be co-sponsored by Sri Lanka at the UNHRC is the same that was presented previously in 2015, Samaraweera stated the government had requested for an extension of two years to implement it.
The media briefing which focused mainly on the previous regime and the findings of the investigations conducted by the current government, commenced with the fact that the international community had been committed to conducting an investigation into the last stages of the war no matter the governments stance on complying with the investigation.
Stressing that the content of the resolution was the national programme provided by the Sri Lankan government and not one that was forced upon it by the international community, he claimed that as the newly elected government at the time, they had laid out a road map for reconciliation, which the international community had not only supported and but also made recommendations to.

Hydropower vs endangered fish CEBs proposed hydropower project  a threat to  endangered  species
	
The Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) is planning to add 85 Gw annual output to the countrys electricity supply, with the proposed Moragolla hydro power project. It is a threat to the green Labeo (Labeo fisheri), a critically endangered fish species that lives in that part of the Mahaveli river, where the Moragolla hydro power station is tobe located. 
The Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) was done by the CEB and the Central Environment Authority (CEA) approved the report. The project began and dynamite was being used.
It was then that the dead Labeo fish were detected, until then, they were considered extinct. The project was halted with this discovery, it was revealed that the CEB had not informed the Department of Wildlife Conservation (DWC) of this and the National Aquatics Resources Association (NARA) was instructed to carry out a study to find out whether more Labeo fish are in there. The fish species was to be translocated to the Kelani river in Kitulagala area. It seemed DWC, CEA and NARA are passing the responsibility to each other, as it was evident from their comments. 
The Asian Development Bank (ADB) was to give a 120 Million loan for the relocation of Labeo fish.
According to senior scientist Ramani Shirantha of NARA, the relocation is not going to happen. In that case, what happens to the ADB loan Nobody knows who got the loan. Every institution related to this is silent when questioned about it. 
Moragolla project manager of CEB, Jayarathna, made it clear that nobody could give information without the chairmans permission. He blatantly said he cannot say anything without written permission and cut the line. We would like to remind all those officers who take cover behind such flimsy excuses that, with the Right to Information Act (RTI act), the public are entitled to information from public officials. 
It appears that the government institutions and officials are not well aware of the projects they are carrying out. The responsible people in higher posts are being ignorant, even when they can find solutions to protect nature whilst exploiting for the benefit of the country. The experts must be imaginative enough to find a solution which can protect nature as well as development activities.
Major hydro projects, blast fishing and mini hydros threaten the Gadaya.
- Madhura De Silva President of WildlifeConservation Society, Galle 
This critically endangered species presently remains in the untouched part of Mahaweli river
	Major hydro projects, blast fishing and mini hydros are the threats to Gadaya.
Commenting on the relocation plan on Green Labeo (locally known as Gadaya), Madhura De Silva said the Green labeo lived in rapidly flowing rivers and it is restricted to Mahaweli basin. This species feeds on algae growing on rock surfaces and they prefer fast flowing water. Green Labeo dislikes the stagnant water and stays in the deep waters, where rocks are common. Fast water flow is crucial to their existence. This critically endangered species presently remains in the untouched part of Mahaweli river. In those areas in the Mahaweli basin, where major hydro power plants -- Victoria, Randenigala and Rantambe -- the damming has changed their migration patterns and the Green labeo are in trouble as they swim upstream to breed. With damming, up stream swimming is impossible and their migration patterns have been
badly affected. 
According to Madhura De Silva, three major factors have been identified as working against the existence of Gadaya. Major hydro projects, blast fishing and mini hydros are the threats to Gadaya. People in Kandy use explosives to harvest fish and the remaining Peradeniya, Gatambe and Galaha areas are subjected to development (human settlements). 
In the lower Knuckles area, people use dynamite in deep pools to harvest fish and this affects the whole population including juvenile and adult fish and the entire fish population, he explained. 
Evaluating the relocation of Green labeo he emphasized the practical difficulties. It is hard to catch this fish species without harming them because they live so deep. Scuba divers with oxygen supply are needed to catch the fish in habitat and thats really difficult. 
We accept that energy is necessary, but at what cost
- Dr. Sewwandi JayakodyEcologist and senior lecturer in Wayamba University
When we were aware that the CEB was calling for tenders to relocate Labeo fish, we sent a letter to DWC asking the details of relocation
	Regarding how many of this species are going to be relocated, they are clueless
At the very beginning of this hydro power project there was no record of Labeo fish in this area. When we were aware that the CEB was calling for tenders to relocate Labeo fish, we sent a letter to DWC asking the details of relocation assessments and about the species. Yet the DWC never sent a reply, Dr. Jayakody said. 
Dr Sewwandi described the Labeo fish as a deep pool inhabiting creature. In those deep pools, the oxygen percentage is really high and its a biological need of the fish species. Their habitats are places where rivers fall from one level to the other and this characteristic is necessary for the species existence. 
The DWC has not yet identified some important facts as in which river they live and their population numbers; regarding how many of this species are going to be relocated, they are clueless. Now they are going to relocate this critically endangered fish species in to Kelani Ganga - Kitulgala area. NARA is doing this. If this relocation is not successful, we ourselves are driving them to extinction. We accept that energy is necessary, but at what cost Do you really need to relocate them because of that, she asked. 

This activity will be illegal under the section 23 A A of National Environment Act.
- Jagath Gunawardena Environment lawyer
This is a species that hadnt been studied very much in Sri Lanka and therefore any capture or any attempt to relocate would be disastrous to this population
	Gadaya or the Green Labeo (Labeo fisheri), is included as a protected species under Section 31 A of Fauna and Flora Protection Ordinance
	Ulcerative Fish Disease is present in the Kelani river
Gadaya or the Green Labeo (Labeo fisheri), is included as a protected species under Section 31 A of Fauna and Flora Protection Ordinance. Therefore, no one can capture, harm, kill or keep in custody or under ones possession any living individual of this species, he said on the legal background of the matter. 
According to the provisions of FFPO, the director of Wildlife Conservation can allow the capture of a protected species of fish only for scientific researches which include conservation purposes. Therefore, any attempt by NARA to catch it and trying to relocate it is illegal and even the director of DWC cannot give permission for such an operation. he claimed. 
The proposed relocation of the species is not included in the permitted activities as per the environment approval granted by the CEA, for this project. Therefore, this activity will be illegal under the section 23 A A of National Environment Act. This is a species that hadnt been studied very much in Sri Lanka and therefore any capture or any attempt to relocate would be disastrous to this population. It is important that a comprehensive study of this species should have been carried out before any attempted relocation. It is also very troubling to note there will be a trans-boundary relocation of this population to Kelani river from the Mahaweli Ganga. There should have been a comprehensive study of the Kelani river, including the native flora and fauna, and whether any predators or any diseases are present in the Kelani river and in the other hand whether any native animal including fish inhabiting the Kelani Ganga would be adversely affected by the newly introduced green Labeo, he explained. 
I am personally aware, from my observations, that the Ulcerative Fish Disease is present in the Kelani river and it has affected species belonging to the family Cyprinidae to which the green Labeo too belongs. Therefore, this possibility has to be comprehensively studied. 
We totally depend on the DWCs position. 
- Kanthi De SilvaActing Deputy Director General of EIA Division - Central Environment Authority
There was a supplementary EIA done in 2014
	During the construction the CEB has noted this protected species living in the area
We are awaiting the decision of DWC, because they have the authority to take action in this matter. There was a supplementary EIA done in 2014 and at that time the hydropower project was approved by the Mahaweli Authority, she said.
During the construction the CEB has noted this protected species living in the area. After that, the DWC had asked NARA to carry out a proper study to find out whether this fish species lived within the site. And I have to say; we totally depend on the DWCs position, she added.
We have directed NARA to do a research on the impact of relocating the species. Our decisions depend on the results of NARA research.
- Hashini SarathchandraPublicity officer of Department of Wildlife Conservation (DWC)
Relocation is not happening
- Ramani ShiranthaSenior Scientist of Inland Aquatic Resources and Aquaculture Division - NARA
 Im not aware of the ADB loan or what happens to it. 
	 Labeo fishery species found in Ethgala area
The relocation is not happening because the report has revealed the Labeo fishery species is there in the Ethgala area in Mahaweli river. And we are going to write a report to DWC. The methods we used to survey the existence of fish species were underwater photographs and videos. And Im not aware of the ADB loan, what happens to it, or what is the
exact amount.

Internet speed rankings: Australia behind SL
	
Australia's internet speed has ranked as the 51st slowest out of 108 countries around the world, lagging behind underdeveloped nations such as Kenya and Sri Lanka.
Internet connections Down Under are considered poorer and slower than 50 other countries, with South Korea topping the list as having the fastest connectivity.
Australia's online bandwidth has pathetic internet speeds compared to the likes of South Korea, Norway, Sweden, Hong Kong and Switzerland - which all have speed above 20 megabits per second (mbps).
Australia's average speed was recorded at 10.01 mbps, seven megabits behind the USA which hits 17.2mbps, Akamai's State of the Internet report found.
Underdeveloped nations such as Kenya recorded far better connectivity speeds than Australia - the east African country listed at the 23rd fastest in the world with an impressive average of 15mbps.
The Philippines were recorded as having the worst internet speed of all the countries surveyed.
In 2015 Australia was sitting at 48th on the list with an average internet speed of 9.6mbps, but last year the country slipped out of the top 50 entirely.
'Quarterly changes were positive across the board except for Australia, which posted a 1.9 per cent decline in adoption,' the report notes.
Vietnam and India were the only two countries to enjoy double-digit growth.
But mobile connectivity in Australia is topping the Asia Pacific region at 13.8mbps, which is higher than the global average of 7mbps.
The disappointing connectivity in Australia was blamed on its unfinished implementation of NBN across the country.
'Providing fast, reliable internet to a vast rural population of this scale is a challenge that no other country has to deal with,' Akamai said.
It is hard to compare Australia's speeds to a small and densely populated country like Singapore, for example, where a single switch provides hundreds of thousands of people with internet.
The original premise of the National Broadband Network vowed it would make Australia a world leader in internet connectivity. (Daily Mail)

JO complains against PM, three others
	
The joint opposition (JO) today complained to the Bribery Commission (BC) against Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, Minister Malik Samarawickrama and the Prime Minister's Senior Advisers R. Paskaralingam and Charitha Ratwatte on the Rs.5 billion loss incurred in the purchase of coal for the Norochcholai Power Plant.
JO MP Vidura Wickramanayake told a news briefing that the alleged financial misappropriation had taken place through the Lanka Coal Company (Pvt) Ltd.
At least eight companies participated in submitting their bids. The Swiss Singapore Overseas Enterprises (Pvt) Ltd. ranked fifth, was granted the contract. The former chairman of Lanka Coal Company (Pvt) Ltd had revealed that there was a huge financial misappropriation which had taken place while purchasing coal for the power plant through this company, he said.
The MP said the Auditor General had also confirmed that the country had suffered a huge financial loss on this coal deal though the Prime Minister had advised that the coal be purchased through this company.
MP Mahindananda Aluthgamage said no investigation had being carried out on the complaints they made to the Bribery Commission under the Top-Ten thieves of the Yahapalanaya Government expect for the Central Bank bond issue.
He said it was praiseworthy for President Sirisena to have appointed a Presidential Commission of Inquiry to probe the bond issue.
This was the tenth complaint made by the JO. As MPs, we have the right to complain to the Bribery Commission because the relevant authorities are not prepared to investigate these complaints. We have decided to raise this matter in Parliament as well, he said.( Kalathma Jayawardhane)

Mangala strikes back at MR
	
Foreign Minister Mangala Samaraweera, yesterday, hit back at former president Mahinda Rajapaksa over the statement issued by him with regard to the UN Human Rights Council resolution of October 2015, which was co-sponsored by the government.
Responding to the statement, Mr. Samaraweera said the decision to co-sponsor resolution 30/1 was not imposed on Sri Lanka, and an extension of the timeline of this resolution by two years would be co-sponsored during the present 34th session of the Human Rights Council.
Why do we choose to do this Because we believe in enhancing, not restricting, the fundamental rights of all our citizens. We believe that we will overcome a painful past by examining it, not by hiding it. We are convinced that we need to put a stop to the cycles of recurring violence that have hitherto hindered our progress as a proud, united country and a united people.
"We know that truth, reparation and justice are essential and further that international jurisdiction over serious crimes only applies when national jurisdiction fails. We are declaring our vision in a resolution before the world to demonstrate that, as an independent, sovereign, and responsible nation, we are fully able to pursue accountability, with our national capacities, and in cooperation with our friends and partners in the international community, thus restoring credibility to our judicial processes, he said in a statement.
He said the transitional justice mechanisms to be implemented would not benefit one group or community above others and would certainly not single out and target the armed forces.
The former president manipulates the respect that the Sri Lankan people have for the armed forces to hide his own responsibilities. This is opportunistic, and especially ironic, coming from the person who imprisoned the commander who led the armed forces to victory, he said.
Mr. Samaraweera said it must be stressed that this first-ever National Unity Government in Sri Lankan history makes no apology for its noble attempts to take all possible action to bring Sri Lankans of all communities together.
We make no apology for listening to all in our country, including our political opponents, and for engaging them in debate and discussion, rather than intimidating, isolating and persecuting them. We make no apology for restoring our countrys good name on the international stage to foster trade and prosperity for all in our country, rather than antagonizing our existing and potential partners.
"We make no apology for our policy of taking steps to combat corruption and root out the decay that has devoured precious state resources for far too long. We make no apology for considering a reform agenda to contribute to long-term peace and stability, because we know that Sri Lankans of all backgrounds desire reform, and yearn for durable peace, prosperity and stability, he said.
He said former president Mahinda Rajapaksa, especially as a lawyer, was very well aware that the issue of foreign judges was mere exaggeration on his part, and he did this on purpose to mislead the public.
Let us not forget that it was under his leadership that multiple transitional justice processes were initiated, and international prosecutors were engaged. The International Independent Group of Eminent Persons (IIGEP) established by him engaged foreigners invited by him, and also nominated by Australia, Canada, the European Commission, UK, Japan, the Netherlands, USA, the Inter-Parliamentary Union, the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), and a Cypriot nominated by the Government of Sri Lanka. International prosecutors were also engaged in connection with the Paranagama Commission, he added in the statement.
He said the National Unity Government, under the leadership of President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, was determined to recover the favourable trade status Sri Lanka enjoyed before the government led by President Rajapaksa squandered it.
Referring to the allegation on replacing the PTA with a new counterterrorism law, he said the PTA was an anachronistic piece of legislation from a conflict plagued past, which was misused by some to commit abuses for narrow political advantages.
To suggest that replacing it with a modern law is unpatriotic is baseless. The security of all Sri Lankans including those who criticise the Government is something that the Government takes seriously, he said.
Former president Rajapaksa had alleged that even though a radical regime change had taken place in the USA, the yahapalana government had not taken any steps to hold talks with the new US administration and to get the resolution against Sri Lanka amended, and that the yahapalakaya co-sponsored this dangerous resolution in 2015 not only due to pressure from foreign parties but also because of their intrinsic anti-national leanings.

Delivering his own submission, from the defence dock, former SDIG Anura Senanayake today requested the prosecution to arrest, without any further delay, the true culprits who committed the murder of Wasim Thajudeen because the unjustifiable delay of the inquiry had violated his Fundamental Rights.

On the other hand, questioning the current progress of the inquiry, Counsel Misbah Sathar, who appeared for the aggrieved party, said that his clients could not be pleased with the current progress of the investigation, because even with sufficient material evidence in court; former Chief JMO Ananda Samarasekara was not arrested yet and brought before justice by the CID.

Trafficking bid foiled: 4 Lankans nabbed at Mumbai Airport
	
The Indian police arrested eight foreign nationals including four Sri Lankans and four British nationals on Wednesday for passport forgery and impersonation, The Times of India reported.
Immigration officials caught the eight, including two women, from boarding gates at the international and domestic sections of Terminal 2 last Friday.
After questioning them for four days, immigration officials learnt that the UK nationals, aged 27-56, had joined the human trafficking ring to help the Lankans reach London. Apparently, entering the UK and working there using a Lankan passport is tough, said police sources, and so the four Lankans had opted for forged Indian passports.
The Lankans had reached the boarding gate of their Mumbai-London flight skipping immigration. The police suspect an airport insider's hand. Two agents who facilitated the deal, one from Mumbai and the other a Lankan, are wanted.
The police say this could be the tip of the iceberg and perhaps a big racket is going on via the city airport whereby foreigners are offered tour packages and called to India so that their identities could be used to help others to fly overseas.
All eight arrested persons did not initially realize the seriousness of the case till they were produced before an Andheri court on Wednesday afternoon. Public prosecutor Neeta Pasarkar explained to Judge JS Mali that the UK and Lankan nationals were introduced to each other by the two agents (Rajan from Mumbai and Logarajan from Lanka), who arranged the forged Indian passports. "The UK nationals gave boarding passes bearing their names for a Mumbai-London flight to the Lankans, who gave the Britons boarding passes for a Mumbai-Ahmedabad flight. In the fake Indian passports, now seized, the agents had used the UK nationals' names for the Lankans," said Pasarkar.
The police say that once the agents are arrested, questions about the crime's complicated modus operandi can be answered.
Explaining the offence, Pasarkar said the LankansKannathasan Karththeepan (26), Gajan Chandrabalan (31), Kandasamy Kaveenthiri (26), and Aruna Shuthakaran (34) landed at the airport along with the Lankan agent (Logarajan) on March 9. They were received by agent Rajan, who arranged their stay at a nearby star hotel. The next day, the agents introduced the Lankans to their British counterpartsBower Oliver (27), Quillian Alan (43), Fivehats Captain (56; sic), and Julie Ann (36).
The Lankans were busted when immigration officials received a tip-off that a few foreigners had managed to skip immigration check and had directly reached boarding gate No 78. "The officials alerted all boarding gates and asked them to check all flyers thoroughly," said a police officer. "Ultimately, personnel at gate 78 stopped the Lankans upon getting suspicious seeing the very British-sounding names on their boarding passes."
