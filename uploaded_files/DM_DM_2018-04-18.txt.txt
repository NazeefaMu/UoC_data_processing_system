Another gazette has to be issued to convene Parliament
	
President Maithripala Sirisena will have to issue another gazette notification specifying the time as to when the new Parliament sessions would commence if the House is to convene on May 8, 2018, Parliament sources said yesterday.
Deputy Secretary-General of Parliament Neil Inddawela who confirmed this situation told Daily Mirror that President will have to issue another gazette notification specifying the time which the House would convene.
There is an option as President could either specify the date and the time when the house would be convened when he is issuing the gazette notification to prorogue Parliament, Mr. Inddawela said.
In this particular case, he said President will have to issue another gazette notification to specify the time when the House would convene.
The President is expected to issue another gazette notification when he returns from his tour to London according to Parliament Sources.

Bill Gates commends Sri Lankan healthcare system
	
Sri Lanka and Bangladesh have built very high quality primary healthcare systems, staffed primarily by women healthcare workers, co-founder of Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Bill Gates said.
He expressed these views while speaking at the joint forum of the Commonwealth Head of Government Meeting held in Westminster on Tuesday.
He praised the Singaporean education system as well. Nobody else is better in the world at education than Singapore, he said.
Mr. Gates said the Commonwealth has to learn from itself in solving its own problems, stating examples of what Nigeria learnt from India in the eradication of polio.
If you want to do something better, find out who is already doing better than anyone else in the world, and adopt what they are doing, to your own challenges. The Commonwealth is ideal for this and you have positive outliers in almost every area of expertise, and you meet regularly to learn from one another.
Polio eradication is a great example of this. For different reasons, India, Nigeria, Pakistan, are three of the places it has been most difficult to wipe out this disease. But India was declared Polio-free in 2014.
The lessons learnt from there have helped Nigeria get to zero cases in 2017. And now Pakistan, which still has few cases, very few, is taking those experiences, particularly at the challenges of dealing with insecurity, and they have their cases down to the lowest areas ever.
So, this success really goes back to the substantial commitments made in part at the Commonwealth meetings. Collectively, Commonwealth nations are experts in far more than just polio eradication, Mr. Gates said. (Sunil Jayasiri from London)

## Title: Former first lady Barbara Bush dies at age 92

Former first lady Barbara Bush dies at age 92
	
Former first lady Barbara Bush died Tuesday at her home in Houston, Texas. She was 92.
"A former first lady of the United States of America and relentless proponent of family literacy, Barbara Pierce Bush passed away Tuesday, April 17, 2018, at the age of 92," reads a statement from the office of former President George H.W. Bush.
Bush passed away shortly after deciding to forgo further medical treatments for her failing health.
Having been hospitalized numerous times while battling congestive heart failure and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, she decided Sunday that she wanted to be "surrounded by a family she adores," according to an earlier statement released by Mr. Bush's office.
"It will not surprise those who know her that Barbara Bush has been a rock in the face of her failing health, worrying not for herself -- thanks to her abiding faith -- but for others," the statement continued. "She is surrounded by a family she adores and appreciates the many kind messages and especially the prayers she is receiving."
In January 2017, Mrs. Bush and her husband were hospitalized at the same time. She was being treated for bronchitis and the nation's 41st president was being treated for pneumonia.
Barbara Bush served as the country's first lady from 1989 to 1993. She is the mother of George W. Bush, the 43rd president of the United States.
Mrs. Bush is one of only two first ladies in the history of the country who is also the mother of a president. Abigail Adams, the wife of John Adams, a founding father of the nation and its second president, was the mother of John Quincy Adams, the sixth U.S. president.
Mrs. Bush is also the mother of Jeb Bush, the former governor of Florida who ran for president of the United States in 2016.
During her tenure as the nation's first lady, Mrs. Bush, the mother of six children, was a champion for global literacy and continued the work after she and her husband left the White House.
In 1989, she formed the Barbara Bush Foundation for Family Literacy, which encourages parents to read to their children.
"Literacy fits in with so many other things," she once told The Chicago Tribune. "If more people could read, fewer people would have AIDS. There would be less homelessness. I'm absolutely convinced of that."
Barbara Pierce Bush was born in New York City, New York, on June 8, 1925, to Marvin and Pauline Pierce. Her father, a magazine publishing executive, was a descendant of Franklin Pierce, a Democrat and the nation's 14th U.S. president who served from 1853 to 1857. Her mother was the daughter of an Ohio Supreme Court justice and was active in civic causes.
The third of four children, Bush later recalled a childhood where her parents would gather and read around the fireplace, fostering her early love of reading.
She graduated high school from the all-girls private Ashley Hall boarding school in Charleston, South Carolina, in the early 1940s, and enrolled in Smith College, a women's college in Northampton, Massachusetts.
At Smith, which was racially integrated, Mrs. Bush became captain of the freshman soccer team, but she dropped out of college in 1945 at the beginning of her sophomore year. She later admitted that she was more interested in her future husband than in her studies.
She had met George Herbert Walker Bush at age 16, while at a Christmastime dance at the Round Hill Country Club in Greenwich, Connecticut. The pair were immediately attracted to each other and began exchanging letters, even as Mr. Bush completed his training to become the then-youngest pilot in the Navy. He named his bomber plane "Barbara" in her honor.
The pair were engaged shortly before Mr. Bush left to fly in World War II, and they wed Jan. 6, 1945, while he was on leave.
Mr. and Mrs. Bush celebrated their 73rd wedding anniversary on Jan. 6.
In an alumni magazine from Smith College, Mrs. Bush said the marriage has endured because of the couple's love for each other.
"I am still old and still in love with the man I married 72 years ago," she said in the interview published in "Smith Alumnae Quarterly" earlier this month.
"George Bush has given me the world," she also said in the magazine. "He is the best -- thoughtful and loving." (ABCE News)

Homeless elderly couple prefer a home to a cave
	
An elderly couple of Serankada in Padiyathalawa has been destined to spend their autumn of life in a cave. This cave is in an archaeological site thats covered with shrub jungle. They have lived there for 29 years after being left homeless following a flood in 1992. The flood had destroyed their wattle and daub house. 
The destitute couple, R.B.Dharmadasa (75) and J.M.Bandara Menike (80), has been living alone after their children found employment in other areas. They said that they were compelled to find shelter in a jungle cave, despite being exposed to the danger of wild animals and venomous snakes. 
Our children, our kith and kin nor the Government authorities have yet paid any attention to our predicament. We depend on the Samurdhi allowance worth Rs.2000 for want of any other income. We are not allowed to clear the jungle to supplement the Samurdhi allowance with Chena cultivation. We rarely have two square meals a day. We starve for days when the Samurdhi allowance is exhausted. Our children living in distant areas are not in a position to take care of us. Archaeological officers have warned us that we should leave the cave since it is located in an archaeological site or else we would be liable to legal action Dharmadasa said. 
We starve for days when the Samurdhi allowance is exhausted. Our children living in distant areas are not in a position to take care of us
They appealed to philanthropists and the social service organizations to look into their predicament and provide them with a house before they are removed from the jungle cave by the authorities.

If Constitution process stalled, Sampanthans Opp. leadership meaningless: Mano
	
If new Constitution process was stalled permanently, Tamil National Alliance (TNA) MP R. Sampanthans holding of Opposition leaders post would be meaningless, Minister Mano Ganesan said today.
He said in a tweet that the issue between the United National Party (UNP) and the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) had put the Constitutional process to back seat.
Not the issue of the UNP and the SLFP but the new constitution as solution to national issue topped Sampanthans priority list. If new Constitution process is stalled permanently, Sampanthans holding of Leader of Opposition would be meaningless, he tweeted.
He said it was sad to notice that the Sinhala nation had failed to understand and respect Sampanthans message of dropping Eelam State and coming into Sri Lankan State radius by taking up the Leader of Opposition job in the Sri Lankan Parliament.

Fragments and Figments: A Collection of Cultural Essays, written by freelance critic Uditha Devapriya, was launched at the Western Province Aesthetic Resort on Friday, April the 6th. The launch ceremony was a resounding success, with the active participation of several distinguished members of Sri Lankas cultural and literary spheres. Malinda Seneviratne and Dr Dayan Jayatilleka, the Chief Guests of the event, delivered speeches revolving around the author and his work, while veteran actor Ravindra Randeniya delivered the welcome address.
Highlights of the event included the live performance of three popular and old songs, including two from films directed by Sumitra Peries, who was present at the ceremony. The two film songs included the nostalgically successful Ran Tikiri Sina, which marked 40 years since its first recording on March 31 and which was performed that night by its original vocalists, Victor Silva and Nirasha Perera. Gehenu Lamayine from Periess debut Gehenu Lamayi was also sung, as was Paawe Wala, closing down the curtains on the event. Veteran media personality and announcer Thilaka Ranasinghe and renowned English announcer and artist Lithmal Jayawardhana were the compres for the night.
At the launch ceremony, Ravindra Randeniya highlighted the need to get Sri Lankas artists and art forms, particularly from the cinema, out to the world in English, pointing out that he and other members of Sri Lankas film industry hoped that this would be the first of many steps to come. Uditha Devapriya in his speech contended that unless the field of criticism is nurtured and maintained well, theres no real way through which those art forms can be conveyed properly to the outside world, observing that the young are key stakeholders in the movement to propagate those art forms and artists.
Fragments and Figments will be available at leading bookstores soon.

Politicians are destroying cricket in Sri Lanka: Murali
	
Sri Lankan cricket is a mess because politicians have taken over, and with little or no knowledge of the game they are destroying the institution with every passing day, cricket legend Muttiah Muralitharan said.
In an interview with Indian Economic Times, Muralitharan spoke about the changes in Sri Lankan cricket and why wrist spinners offer better dividends in good batting conditions.
The Conversation:
What is wrong with Sri Lanka cricket
From the days of Sanath Jayasuriya, Kaluwitharana, Aravinda de Silva and Arjuna Ranatunga to today, it has undergone a sea change. Dont go so far back. In 2014, we won the World T20 beating India in the final in Dhaka and in 2011 we made the final of the 50-over World Cup in India. So what we are seeing today is a very recent development. To tell you the truth Sri Lankan cricket is currently in a mess. Politicians have taken over the running of the game and with little or no knowledge of the game they are destroying the institution with every passing day. Cricket is all about confidence. Giving the players the confidence to perform. Making them feel great when they wear Sri Lankan colours. I did not become a champion bowler in one day. For 4-5 years, Arjuna kept giving me the confidence. Thats how I became who I am. Now every time a batsman goes out to bat he is told you have to score or else we will bench you. The same is true for bowlers. In the last one year Sri Lanka has fielded some 60 players across all formats. 60 players in one year! This is irrational and tells you there is no vision how the game should be run. Such frequent chopping and changing will only end up destroying the game further.
But have the players done justice to the opportunities they have been given
Take the case of Kusal Mendis. All of us thought he was a bright spark and will serve Sri Lanka cricket for a long time. He started out extremely well. However, within months he was out of the team. One bad series and dropped. Such things do little to inspire confidence among cricketers.
Moving away to something different now. Weve recently seen India prefer Kuldeep Yadav and Yuzvendra Chahal over Ravichandran Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja because they get more purchase in overseas conditions. Wrist spinners rather than finger spinners seem to be the flavour. Your take on this.
Wrist spinners will always give you better dividends in overseas conditions. Or more simply put in good batting conditions. There cant be any debate on this matter. They are expected to pick more wickets and I can clearly see and understand why the Indian selectors have done what they have done. Theres always an element of mystery to wrist spinners and until this mystery is decoded they will deliver for the captain. I dont know whether Ashwin or Jadeja will be back but the reasoning behind the call is fairly obvious. And both Kuldeep and Chahal have done well and justified the faith shown in them.
Are you saying that to be successful every spinner today will have to have something mysterious in his repertoire
While that is correct Im also saying you have to keep your core intact. I always emphasised on bowling off-spin first and then trying out other things. Bowling too many doosras, for example, can impact your off spin bowling and it has happened to people in the past. Thats what modern day spinners need to keep in mind.
Coming to IPL, very good start to the season for your team.
It is a marathon and the race has just started. What weve done is create a team that has real good balance. Many people asked why we chose Wriddhiman Saha. It was a clearly thought out strategy. Last year we did not have good spin back-up options after Rashid Khan. This year we do. We have picked Sakib Al Hasan as our first choice left-arm spinner. When you have two quality spin bowlers in your team, its essential you have a good keeper. Else, the chances created by the spinners are wasted more often than not. So in that sense weve done what we could have. Now only time will tell if the planning gives us the results we are hoping for.
A word on David Warners absence  you must be missing him.
His are big shoes to fill. He has been an exceptional player for us and for any team he has played for. But there is little that can be done and I have to say Kane Williamson has led the team very well in Warners absence. He has the experience and has held the dressing room together quite nicely.

Scrapping Presidency insane: Wijeyadasa
	
Former Justice Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe said today only a person with an insane mind could propose to abolish the Executive Presidency at a juncture like this when the country was hit by anarchy.
Mr Rajapakshe told the Daily Mirror that former President the late J.R. Jayewardene introduced the Executive Presidential system, coupled with the current electoral system in 1978, as it was befitting to the country.
He said constitution was modelled on the French Constitution to avoid the formation of unstable Governments.
He noted that each administrative district, barring those in the north, was considered a constituency under this system. A cut off point of 12.5 percent votes was introduced for any party to get his members elected under the electoral system.
He said the entire system was distorted after the reduction of the cut-off point to five percent during the rule of R. Premadasa, to appease late Minister A.H.M. Ashraff, who formed the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress (SLMC).
Since then, Mr Rajapakshe said no major party had been able to gain an absolute majority to form a stable Government except in 2010 when former President Mahinda Rajapaksa secured it riding on the wave of his popularity after the war victory.
Otherwise, on each occasion, a major party got only 108-110 seats in Parliament. As a result, the major parties always have to dance to the tune of minor and minority parties holding only four or five seats in the House.
The abolition of Executive Presidency will lead to further anarchy in the country under such circumstances. Therefore, only an insane person can ask for the abolition of the Executive Presidency. The JO proposed this. It is even hilarious to see the political formation of Mahinda Rajapaksa advocating it, he said.
He said anarchy prevailed at the local authorities after the February elections. He said the anarchy had been caused by the inclusion of certain provisions in the law at the behest of leaders of small parties such as Anura Kumara Dissanayake.
He said the same would happen to the Provincial Councils if the elections were conducted under the same system.
Earlier, the allegation at the Executive Presidents was that they behaved like dictators. But, the allegation against the present President is that he behaves like a puppet.
He should exercise his executive power in the interests of the country. If he acted in that sense, he could have stopped the alienation of the Hambantota Port, Mr Rajapakshe said. (Kelum Bandara)

Social media ban: Undue pressure from diplomats: President
	
When the Sri Lankan Government took action to impose the curfew, banning the social media and declaring the State of Emergency to control the Sinhala-Muslim unrest in the Kandy District in March, there were undue pressures from certain diplomats on the Government, President Maithripala Sirisena said on Tuesday in London.
Certain diplomats spoke against the Government moves to take necessary action-including banning access to social media sites. Some of the diplomats acted beyond their mandate against the move, the President told a group of Sri Lanka community in London Tuesday night.
But despite those oppositions, the Government had taken necessary action, and because of that we able to prevent a major tragedy, he said.
The President also said that at that time, an organization connected to the UN had stated that Sri Lanka had managed to impose a complete ban on the social media sites-something even the US couldnt do.
Almost all the international organizations welcomed the Government move to ban social media, and many parents of school children and others told me that it was a good move and requested not to remove the ban, he said.
The President said that about 75% of the media reports on the Kandy unrest incidents were completely wrong.
Those wrong information reached to the Sri Lankan diaspora, who eventually come to a wrong conclusion about the countrys situation, the President said.
He requested the members of the Sri Lankan community, who were present at the meeting, not to depend only on social media for credible information.
A large number of the Sri Lankan community living in London participated.
Ministers Mangala Samaraweera, Nimal Siripala de Silva, Rishad Bathiudeen and acting Sri Lankan High Commissioner in London Sugeeswara Gunaratne were also present. (Sunil Jayasiri in London)

The relics of Lord Buddha will not be transported to SL
	
The National Museum, part of the Ministry of Culture of Government of India, had last month approached M S University, seeking the relics as a temporary loan from the university.
The museum had, in turn, received a request from the Government of Sri Lanka which had sought the relics that were to be kept in display for people to pay veneration on the occasion of Buddha Purnima on April 30 and a few days later in Sri Lanka.
But sources suggest that the idea of transporting the priceless antiquity has now been dropped as the National Museum has decided to send some another artefact to Sri Lanka.
The relics are in pride possession of the Department of Archaeology and Ancient History of MSU which all these years have safeguarded them in lock and key.
In fact, sources suggest that the department too had its reservations regarding the safety and preservation of the relics which are lighter than a feather in weight.
For us, it was for the first time that we had received the proposal to loan this priceless possession. The National Museum off course has years of experience in handling and transporting such items. But, since we had received the directives directly from the government, we were in no position to decline their request, said a MSU official, who is happy that the relics will now continue to remain in the departments safe custody.
MSUs syndicate members too had accepted the proposal earlier this month albeit with certain conditions regarding how the relics should be transported.
The union ministry had stated that the relics will be transported to Sri Lanka with full security and care as per the procedure and will be later safely returned to MSU.
The relics were found after a team of archaeologists from MSU had guessed that a 'stupa' and a 'vihara' were lying beneath two mounds in Devni Mori, a village in North Gujarat that was going to be submerged in 1957 for construction of a dam.
It was on January 14, 1963, that the relic casket containing bodily remains of 'Dashabala' (Buddha) was discovered. A line on the inscription on the casket identified the relics within: Dashabala Sharira Nilayaha - This is the abode of the relics of Dashabala. (Times of India)

World's largest cargo aircraft at MRIA
	
The world's largest cargo aircraft, Antonov An-225 Mriya landed at the Mattala Rajapaksa International Airport (MRIA) this morning, Airport Manager Upali Kalansuriya said.
Speaking to the Daily Mirror, Kalansuriya said the cargo aircraft was being refuelled and that its crew was resting.
It is iconic to have the worlds largest aircraft at MRIA and it is the first time that this type of aircraft arrived in the country. The aircraft arrived from Kuala Lumpur and has scheduled to departure for Karachi, Pakistan 2.00 a.m tomorrow, he said.
The Antonov An-225 Mriya, a strategic airlift cargo aircraft, was designed by the Antonov Design Bureau in the Ukrainian SSR within the Soviet Union during the 1980s. Powered by six turbofan engines, it is the heaviest aircraft ever built and has a maximum takeoff weight of 640 tonnes. The Mriya also has the largest wingspan of any aircraft in operational service.
The aircraft was designed to airlift the Energia rocket's boosters and the Buran orbiter for the Soviet space program. Developed as a replacement for the Myasishchev VM-T, the An-225's original mission and objectives are almost identical to that of the United States' Shuttle Carrier Aircraft.
