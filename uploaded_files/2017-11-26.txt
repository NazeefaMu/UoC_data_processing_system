Cache of weapons recovered at Navanthurai
	
The Special Task Force in Jaffna recovered a cache of weapons wrapped in a fertiliser bag and dumped in a roadside drain at Navanthurai on the Jaffna- Vaddukoddai Road early today.
This came on the eve of the commemoration of LTTE Leader Velupillai Prabhkaran's 63rd Birth AnnivVelupillaithe organisation's Maveerar Naal, which falls on November 26 and 27.
?Ten T-56 assault rifles, 300 rounds of T-56 ammunition, 2 RPG and two smoke bombs were among the weapons recovered,? the Police said.
The STF team was able to recover the weapons after a passerby informed the Police about a suspicious bag lying in a roadside drain.
The Police suspect that people who had dumped the weapons in the drain had done so to evade detection by the Police who had been conducting raids these days in view of reports on the arrangements by various groups to hold commemorations of the LTTE leader's birthday and the organisation's Maveerar Day.
The Police said that they were now conducting investigations to ascertain who had dumped the weapons in the drain. (Text and pix by Romesh Madushanka)

Do not use our children as guinea pigs: Gemunu
	
The SAITM Medical Faculty Parents Forum?s Convener Gemunu Wijeratne today urged the committee to investigate SAITM matter headed by Deputy Minister Dr. Harsha De Silva not to use their children as guinea pigs.
In a joint press briefing held with the Medical Faculty Students' Parents Association (MFSPA) Mr. Wijeratne charged that the committee is allegedly attempting to mislead them by converting the institute to a different entity without abolishing it.
He accused that the deputy minister is experimenting to legalize the private medical institutes using the SAITM students without resolving the matter therefore they don?t have faith on the committee.
He also said SAITM was established without any legal framework and it would take ages to legalize private medical institutes even as a different entity.? Therefore he? urged the government to enroll the SAITM students to the state medical faculties immediately.
? We cannot wait for some more years. We request the authorities to appoint an independent professional committee comprising? deans of the medical faculties to resolve this issue.? he said.
When contacted Chairman of the committee Dr. Harsha de Silva said that Dr. Tennakoon has been appointed on behalf of the SAITM Parents Association therefore he cannot comment on Mr. Wijeratne?s statement.
?I?m totally independent on this matter. I cannot talk to each parent of the SAITM. If Mr. Wijeratne want to take part in the committee let him do so,? deputy minister said. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

Queenstown rallies in support of family facing deportation to SL
	
The people of Queenstown showed their compassion as they took to the streets in support of a family facing deportation to Sri Lanka.
After eight years in New Zealand, Dinesha Amarasinghe, her husband Sam Wijerathne and their three sons have been told they are to be deported to their birth country as Dinesha, the primary visa holder, was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis three years ago.
A humanitarian appeal has been lodged but the family's future remains uncertain.
About 400 people marched through streets more familiar to tourist buses than protests, many with tears in their eyes, to show their support for the family.
Clutha-Southland MP Hamish Walker organised the march and walked with the family at the front leading a chant of "We support" as others joined the crowd. Ultimately the crowd finished with the rally cry: "Let them stay".
Teachers and class mates from Queenstown Primary School attended, volunteers firefighters, representatives from social services and people who have been moved by the family's story.
Some people said it was the first time they had marched for any reason.
Walker said he thought it was first time in New Zealand a public march had been held to support a family in this type of situation.
Baskets of Blessings co-ordinator Tam Schurmann has been supporting the family and told the crowd she was "entirely and completely heartbroken" when she first visited the family in the one-bedroom cabin they call home in the former Queenstown Camping ground.
"There was a despair that filled the room. The boys hung their heads, there was very little food on the table and Dinesha and Sam were full of tears, full of despair, vulnerable and with a feeling a nobody was backing them in a situation which was dire."
The march was "an outpouring of love for a family that we respect and we want as part of Queenstown," she said.
Many people in Queenstown had moved from foreign countries and knew immigration was not easy, she said.
The family had a good life in Sri Lanka, despite the threat of crime and corruption, but had moved to New Zealand for a better future for their children.
They were hard working, volunteered in the community, helped at school and the children were doing exceptionally well at school.
"We don't want to to see them leave. Especially now. Dinesha needs us more than ever," she said.
In Sri Lanka they would face crime and danger.
"They face financial hardship in their lives because everything they came over with has been put into surviving in this country, put into visas and immigration applications. They have nothing to go back to.
Dinesha's medicine can't even be found in Sri Lanka. The children don't speak the language and for Sam to go off to work means there will be no supervision for these three young boys."
"This is the heart of Queenstown exposed right here...Incredible support and I believe that when the Minister of Immigration...sees this outpouring of support, I believe that his heart will be filled with compassion. I believe that this is a powerful voice to have Dinesha and Sam and the boys stay in New Zealand."
Sam emotionally thanked the crowd for their support and said his family was going through a really tough time.
"I had a good life in my country but came here to get a better future for my kids...after five years my wife is diagnosed with MS."
Walker said it showed what a "a wonderful, caring place Queenstown is."
"I am so proud of my community.
Marchers Melissa Copland said her sons were friends with the boys at school.
"They're lovely. They've been around home and they play a mean game of cricket," she said.- Stuff

Shanaka fined for ball tampering
	
Sri Lanka all-rounder Dasun Shanaka has been fined 75 per cent of his match fee after he admitted to ball tampering on day two of the Nagpur Test against India.
Shanaka was charged by the umpires following the second day's play, after television cameras showed him picking up an area on the ball next to the seam on several occasions.
He duly admitted to "changing the condition of the ball" and accepted the proposed sanction handed down by match referee David Boon, meaning there was no need for a formal hearing.
In addition to his fine, Shanaka has picked up three demerit points. Any player reaching four or more within a 24-month period faces a suspension.
Boon said: "These are early days in Dasun's career and I am sure this sanction will ensure he is more careful when maintaining the condition of the ball in the future."
India ended day two of the second Test in command on 312-2, thanks largely to hundreds from Murali Vijay and Cheteshwar Pujara.

UNP ready to work with anyone backing Good Governance: PM
	
The United National Party (UNP) was ready to work with anyone willing to uphold Good Governance and to mutually strengthen electoral prospects, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said today.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe made this remark at the UNP Bala Mandalaya meeting in Nawalapitiya last morning.
?The UNP is willing to work with anyone who welcomes and upholds values of Good Governance but our party should strengthen itself to take the Good Governance forward,? he said.
?We managed to get elected to office in the highest level and now we need to strengthen ourselves at the grassroots level. If we strengthen ourselves in the grassroots level it will be possible to strengthen in the provincial level. Therefore let us work heard and win the Local Government elections in 2018,? the Prime Minister said.
?We came into office in 2015 but it is only on the top level. We face obstacles in carrying out development work as there is no support from the institutions at the village level as they are being held by the Opposition.? he added.
At the same time, he said, the Government had been able to stabilise the economy and make funds available for development work at village level.
?We have laid a foundation stone for a high-tech training centre in Nawalapitiya today and also we have started the work on the Central Highway.
?It would be possible to go to Colombo from Kandy in one-and-a-half hours in two years? time. We have done all these without having the control at the grassroots level. Imagine what we could have achieved if we had control at the village level,? he said.
The Prime Minister said that those party members, who had been subjected to political victimisation would be taken care of, before long.
Earlier the Prime Minister told the Nawalapitiya High-tech Training Centre foundation stone laying ceremony, that both President Maithripala Sirisena and he had gone from country to country to regain the attention of the international community, which Sri Lanka had lost in the past. (Yohan Perera)
