Afghan soldier opens fire on U.S. troops, killing two
	

(c) 2017, The Washington Post  Jun 10, 2017 - KABUL, Afghanistan - An Afghan soldier opened fire on U.S. troops in a restive eastern province of Afghanistan on Saturday, killing two and injuring at least two more, authorities said. 
The shooting occurred in the Achin district of Afghanistans Nangahar province, according to a U.S. defence official, an area where both Islamic State and Taliban insurgents are contesting territory.

Early media reports suggested the assailant was an elite Afghan commando, although that is not confirmed. The gunman was killed by American troops, according to a security official in the province. The Taliban are also active in the area. A Taliban spokesman sent a text message to journalists Saturday claiming the alleged assailant was an infiltrator of the Afghan army.

ComBank hosts seminars for SMEs in Polonnaruwa, Gampaha
	

An ongoing initiative of Commercial Bank of Ceylon to develop entrepreneurship in the small and medium enterprise (SME) sector benefitted 341 entrepreneurs in the Polonnaruwa and Gampaha areas, the majority of them women.
The bank hosted two seminars in these towns for 140 businessmen of the North Central Province and for 201 entrepreneurs in the Gampaha District, the latter exclusively for women.
The resource person for both programmes was Chandana Gunawardena, a leading speaker on motivation and business development. The emphasis of these programmes was on empowerment of participants in the areas of business development
and sustainability.
The Polonnaruwa programme was attended by Commercial Bank North Central Regional Manager Saneth Jayasundara, officers of the banks Development Credit Department and the managers of the Kaduruwela and Hingurakgoda branches of
Commercial Bank.
The Gampaha programme was attended by Commercial Bank Colombo Metro Acting Regional Manager S.B. Wasala, officers of the banks Development Credit Department and the branch managers of the Gampaha, Ganemulla, Kadawatha, Kirindiwela, Veyangoda and Weliveriya branches. This was the second of such programme conducted by the bank exclusively for the benefit of women entrepreneurs in the country.
Commercial Bank has been conducting similar programmes for entrepreneurs in many areas of the country. The bank has to date conducted 61 such programmes which have benefited nearly 5,500 entrepreneurs. In May 2016, the bank conducted a programme specifically designed for women entrepreneurs in Matara, which was attended by over 100 participants.
This programme was supported by the National Enterprise Development Authority (NEDA), which played a key role in identifying prospective women entrepreneurs for the programme.
These programmes are also supported by the banks 15 Agriculture and Micro Finance Units (AMFUs), which play a key role in helping the bank to identify specific needs of people who require assistance to develop either their agriculture activities or micro businesses and are dedicated to promote agriculture lending and microfinance.
Commercial Banks AMFUs are located in Ratnapura, Narammala, Kandy, Anuradhapura, Kilinochchi, Bandarawela, Wellawaya, Hingurakgoda, Galewela, Atchuvely, Vavuniya, Kattankudy, Tissamaharama, Neluwa and Pottuvil.

DR Congo jailbreak frees 900 inmates
	
Eleven people were killed when militants attacked a prison in the Democratic Republic of Congo and freed more than 900 inmates yesterday according to officials, BBC reported.
The governor of North Kivu province said the attackers had used heavy weapons in the raid on the jail in Beni.
At least eight of the dead are prison guards, Julien Paluku added. A curfew has been declared.
The identity of the attackers is not yet clear.
Local activist Teddy Kataliko said many self-defence militias, known as Mai-Mai groups, operated around Beni.
DR Congo has been in crisis since President Joseph Kabila refused to step down after his term ended last year.
The incident in Beni is the latest in a series of jailbreaks in the country.

Final decision on removing full face helmet next week
	
The amended gazette notification on removing controversial full face ban is to be issued at the end of anext week, National Council for Road Safety (NCRS) said.
NCRS Chairman Dr. Sisira Kodagoda said following a discussion held with the experts and Ceylon Motorcyclists Association (CMA) members, the NCRS had decided to lift the ban on full face helmets.
The gazette notice was issued on 23rd February stating that all helmets worn by motorcyclists and the pillion riders must be in line with the new guidelines.
The previous gazette was issued making a mandatory requirement to wear a helmet by the motorcyclist with certain restrictions. However it did not impose a ban on full face helmets directly but the helmets with a longer chin guard that obstruct the view of the speed 'o meter were banned,
He said due to the protests made by the motorcyclists the NCRS would amend the gazette notice by next week with necessary amendments.
According to the Dr. Kodagoda full face helmets with minimum standard of SLS or any other international standards would be allowed to use in future. We will gazette the SLS as the minimum standard requirement for the helmets, he said.
He said the NCRS will grant minimum one year period to shift to a SLS or international standard produced helmet and once the period expired the Consumer Authority will seize the inferior quality helmets in the markets and the traffic police will be given the permission to remove the helmets which does not meet stipulated standards.
Accordingly he said the NCRS will impose a ban on tinted visor helmets as well. We will introduce a certain percentage of tint in the visors and all helmets which exceed the standard percentage will be seized, he said.
Meanwhile, Ceylon Motorcyclists Association (CMA) Secretary Chirantha Amarasinghe welcomed the NCRS move. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

GMOA requests minister to further extend SLMC President's term
	
The Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) today urged Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne to extend the term of Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) President Prof. Carlo Fonseka for a further five years.
Addressing a media briefing, GMOA Assistant Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said Prof. Fonsekas term ended last December and it has been extended for a further 6 months ending on June 30.
According to the SLMC constitution, the Health Minister has the power to extend the term or to appoint another to the presidency. Prof. Fonseka has served the SLMC and fought to safeguard medical education during his tenure, he said,
Dr. Aluthge said political henchmen interested in the position are waiting to snatch the position however, the future of the medical education cannot rely on them.
Further he said the Indian Medical Council President has also been accused of corruption and a bribery case has been filed against him.
Therefore Dr. Aluthge said without extending Prof. Fonsekas term for another six months, the minister should extend and create an environment to work with him for another five years. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

Pakistan restrict SL to 236
	
Pakistan took a giant stride towards the semi-finals of the Champions Trophy after Sri Lanka collapsed to 236 all out in the Asian rivals must-win group match at Cardiff on Monday.
Both sides needed a victory to join already qualified title-holders India from Group B in the last four of a tournament featuring the worlds top eight one-day international sides, with the losers knocked out.
Sri Lanka, sent in to bat, were making steady progress at 161 for three while top-scorers Niroshan Dickwella (73) and skipper Angelo Mathews (39) were at the crease.
But the loss of Mathews sparked a middle-order collapse that saw four wickets lost for just six runs as Sri Lanka slumped to 167 for seven.
Only same late tail-order hitting, with the last three wickets adding 69 runs, got Sri Lanka past 200 in an innings where Pakistan pacemen Junaid Khan (three for 40) and Hasan Ali (three for 43) did the bulk of the damage.
But with 300 now a par score in ODI cricket, Sri Lanka knew it would take something special in the field to deny Pakistan a likely semi-final against tournament hosts England in Cardiff on Wednesday.
Prior to their middle-order slup, Sri Lanka lost two wickets for one run to be 83 for three.
Hasan, as hed done while taking three wickets in Pakistans surprise win over South Africa, went wide of the crease to bowl Kusal Mendis (27) with a brilliant delivery angled towards the legside that cut away and clipped the top of off stump.
Two balls later, medium-pacer Fahim Ashraf struck on his ODI debut when Dinesh Chandimal played on for a duck.
Mathews helped staunch the flow of wickets while keeping the scoreboard ticking over as Dickwella dug in.
All-rounder Mathews, fresh from an unbeaten fifty in Sri Lankas shock seven-wicket victory over India, drove off-spinner Mohammad Hafeez for six, while Dickwella ended a sequence of 54 balls without a boundary by cover-driving left-arm spinner Imad Wasim for four.
Mathews, however, fell when an inside edge off Mohammad Amir gave the elated left-arm paceman his first wicket of the tournament.
Dhananjaya de Silva, only recently arrived as a replacement for the injured Kusal Perera, managed just one before, squared up by Junaid, he edged to Pakistans wicket-keeper captain Sarfraz Ahmed.
At 162 for five, much now rested on Dickwella.
But he fell without another run on the board when a low inside edge off Amir was brilliantly held one-handed by a diving Sarfraz to end an 86-ball vigil.
And when Junaid had Thisara Perera well taken at slip by Babar Azam, Sri Lanka were 167 for seven off 35 overs.
Asela Gunaratne, dropped on two when Sarfraz lost control of a diving chance off Amir, chipped in with 27 before Ashraf (two for 37) ended the innings with four balls to spare when he caught and bowled Nuwan Pradeep. (Hindustan Times)

The issuance of a circular cancelling the leaves of employees prior to a strike is not unusual. The circular was issued to avoid any disruption to the postal services. This practice is adopted by other state institutions as well, he said.
Earlier today, United Postal Trade Unions Front President Chinthaka Bandara said that they would conduct a 48-hour strike midnight today.

Pressure in Britain builds on Theresa May to step aside
	

By Griff Witte 
The pressure on Prime Minister Theresa May to step aside following a humiliating election grew Saturday, with her two top aides resigning, a leading newspaper pronouncing her fatally wounded and a former minister acknowledging that Tories were plotting possible replacements via the messaging service WhatsApp. 
The aides who resigned, Fiona Hill and Nick Timothy, Mays fiercely loyal co-chiefs of staff, had been blamed within the Conservative Party for the lackluster campaign. 
Their departures were seen Saturday as a Downing Street bid to stave off a far more dramatic resignation: that of the prime minister herself. 
But it was unclear whether it would be enough, with some Conservatives acknowledging that May has effectively become a lame-duck leader following a vote that was supposed to give her a resounding mandate but instead morphed into a stinging rejection that could end her premiership within days.

Senior Tories have been conspicuous in their silence, and behind the scenes the party has been engaged in fevered debate whether to push for Mays ouster - if not now, then perhaps in several months after Britains EU divorce talks have launched.

S, Korea names new defence minister to counter Norths arms threat
	

REUTERS, 11th JUNE, 2017-South Koreas President Moon Jae-in on Sunday nominated a former navy chief as his defence minister, the presidents office said, as the government faces challenges tackling North Koreas rapidly developing weapons program.
The nominee, Song Young-moo, was well suited to deal with North Koreas nuclear and missile threat, the presidential Blue House office said.
Under third-generation leader Kim Jong Un, North Korea has been conducting missile tests at an unprecedented pace in an effort to develop an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of striking the mainland United States. The North test-launched a new type of its cruise anti-ship missiles on Thursday, its fourth missile test since the Souths Moon took office on May 10, pledging to engage in dialogue with Pyongyang.
Song, who served in the navy for more than three decades, was Moons main security adviser during his presidential campaign, reprising his role in Moons 2012 presidential campaign. A decorated veteran, Song took part in a 2009 skirmish between North and South Korean naval vessels off the western coast of the Korean peninsula.
Songs appointment does not need parliaments approval, but he must attend a hearing and answer questions from lawmakers.

A delegation led by former Rear Admiral Sarath Weerasekara is to leave for Geneva on Wednesday to attend the 35th session of the UN Human Rights (UNHR) Council.
He said they intend lobbying in favour of Sri Lanka and to handover a petition against UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Zeid Al Hussein for interfering in the internal affairs of a sovereign country.
The petition is to be handed over to the President of the UNHRC, Joaqun Alexander Maza Martelli.
Mr. Weerasekara said Mr. Hussein had interfered in Sri Lanka's internal affairs by defaming its judiciary and calling for constitutional reforms as a means of providing a political solution to the national question.
The High Commissioner is calling for a hybrid court in violation of our Constitution. Therefore, we demand a public apology for making false accusations and interfering in our internal affairs, he told a news conference organised by the Federation of National Organisations.
Mr. Weerasekara said the delegation would also lobby against the report of the Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers, Mnica Pinto. The report was compiled by her based on the findings during a visit to Sri Lanka from April 29 to May 7 last year. (By Lahiru Pothmulla)

There was no need for 30-year bonds: AG
	
Testifying at the Presidential Commission of Inquiry on the Central Bank bond sales, Auditor General (AG) Gamini Wijeysinghe said the decision to opt for 30-year bonds at high interests rates could not be rationalized because according to the Finance Ministry the Government wanted to borrow to settle interest payments on previous bonds sales.
Initially, the Government needed to borrow Rs.13.5 billion by March 2, 2015 with the CB originally intending to sell 30-year bonds of one billion rupees at the primary auction held on February 27.
He said Rs.10 billion was generated for interest payments on previously sold bonds and that there was no need to raise money solely from bond auctions, because the funds could have been raised through the Direct Placement Method (DPM) from the Employees Provident Fund and through short term Treasury Bills.
However, it was revealed at the Commission that former governor Arjun Mahendran had visited the Public Debt Department (PDD) on two occasion while the auction was taking place and had instructed that Rs.10.058 billion be raised even at the rate of 12.50%.
During the evidence led by Additional Solicitor General Yasantha Kodagoda PC, it was revealed that bids of up Rs.2,000 million was received from Perpetual Treasuries Ltd (PTL) while Rs.3,000 million was accepted from the Bank of Ceylon, largely on behalf of the PTL.
After a comparison with the previous practices at the CBSL on bond sales, the AG said the value of the bids accepted by the CBSL was far above the value of the bids offered by the CBSL.
Examining 248 previous bond sales between 2008 and 2014, the AG said it was an unprecedented decision by the CBSL.
He said the CBSL had failed to provide proper information on the secondary market transactions for the Auditor Generals Department to prepare its report.
When asked about the temporary suspension of the DPM on March 2, 2015 the AG said there was no such decision from the Monetary Board according to his findings.
He said despite the PDDs recommendation to accept only Rs.2.6 billion through the auction, the ex-governor had intervened and instructed the Tender Board to increase it to Rs.10 billion. (Shehan Chamika Silva)

It is high time now for the people of Sri Lanka to challenge the authority of the Tamil National Alliance, to act and speak on their behalf, on various matters be they political or otherwise. The International Community that includes the UN agencies, European Union, Commonwealth, UNHCR and such others too should come out openly to back the peoples demand, to stop the TNA from functioning further. During these thirteen years from 2004 the TNA was shrewd enough, in not missing a single chance, that came on their way, to strengthen themselves with the support of the International Community, which gave full support on the belief, that the TNA had been functioning in the best interest of the people. 
History is a countrys record of past events, Social Political and Economic, in order of time. Likewise the history of a country is the history of its great individuals. Therefore it is absolutely necessary to see that distorted facts are not introduced into the history of the country by ambitious and greedy persons for their personal gains. 
I have a sacred duty to protect the history of the Tamil United Liberation Front (TULF) which is obviously a part of the history of the Tamil people, founded by two great individuals G.G. Ponnambalam QC and S.J.V. Chelvanayagam QC. They merged their political parties, the All Ceylon Tamil Congress (ACTC) and the Ilankai Tamil Arasu Kadchi (ITAK) also known as Federal Party, respectively, to form the Tamil United Front (TUF) on May 14, 1972 and subsequently changed it as Tamil United Liberation Front (TULF) at the next convention of the TULF, at which the President of the TULF S.J.V. Chelvanayagam got elected with G.G. Ponnambalam and Sowmiyamoorthy Thondaman, the leader of the Ceylon Workers Congress (CWC) to share the chair of the TULF with him.
The very purpose of doing so was to prevent the revival of these two parties which both leaders wanted to remain merged forever. They had similar ideas with regard to the Ceylon Workers Congress (CWC) also on a future date. They left behind the TULF as their legacy for the Tamil people of Sri Lanka to look after all their interests. 
To strengthen and unite all, the TULF, on the advice of some leading Tamil citizens such as V. Kailayapillai, Kandiah Neelakandan, V.R. Vadivetkarasan, Nirmalan Karthikeyan, S. Thiyagarajah and K. Jeyabalasingam, the TULF agreed to form an alliance with three other parties, all of which were involved in an armed struggle, fighting for the liberation of the Tamils and agreed to contest on the TULF ticket with its symbol Rising Sun. The alliance partners comprised of the TULF, ACTC, TELO and the EPRLF contested the General Election in 2001 at which, the alliance won 15 seats. 
I have now found solace in an interesting article I could trace in one of the bundles of interesting articles collected by me during the last so many years. The article referred to is captioned Tamil Parties cannot play coy in a corner, authored by one of our most courageous and honest journalist, the late Mr. Dharmaratnam Sivaram, popularly known as Taraki, gunned down 12 years back. A local English daily carried it on February 11, 2004 with a photograph of mine super-imposed in a larger photograph of the late S.J.V. Chelvanayagam. If Taraki had not been killed at that time, several thousand innocent lives could have been saved, based on this article alone. He was the only one who had the courage to write in that tone, while several others were mercilessly condemning me and even ordained me as a traitor. There were some who even asked as to why I was being kept alive. It was Taraki, who was not my friend but only known to me, in his article who had defended me, which I take as high complements paid to me and had also exonerated me of several unjustifiable accusations levelled against me, in a confused situation at that time, for which although belated, I wish to thank him not for anything else, but mainly for his courage. I hope that everyone, especially those who had been trading on his name and got many benefits including seats in Parliament, will drop their heads down in shame. The following, is an extract of the article referred to, clears a lot of doubts, some of which are still being used by some for their personal benefits. 
Even the name TNA was imposed on the quarrelsome bunch by the Tamil media, much to the chagrin of the TULF and the ACTC, which preferred to call it the Alliance of Tamil Political Parties. The dominant image of the TNA as the political paw of the Tiger is deceptive
The Tamil National Alliance has been made out to be more than what it actually is. If not for a variety of external pressures, it would have imploded at inception. Contrary to the chief myth about the TNA that it is managed by the Liberation Tigers - some of its leading politicians have had no scruples in running with the hare and hunting with the hound. They have no scruples in smartly exploiting the LTTE for their own political advantage. If you ask me, some of them wouldnt even care two hoots for the struggles and aspirations of the Tamil people. If they do, then we would have seen images of Mr. M or Mr. S or Mr. V, fasting unto death in Tellipalai last week (their names are withheld to avoid any embarrassment). 
The attempt to portray TULF President Anandasangaree as the villain of the peace, is very wrong. At least the man speaks his mind. Even the name TNA was imposed on the quarrelsome bunch by the Tamil media, much to the chagrin of the TULF and the ACTC, which preferred to call it the Alliance of Tamil Political Parties. The dominant image of the TNA as the political paw of the Tiger is deceptive. 
All those who read these will agree atleast now, that all that was said about the TNA, the myth that the TNA was managed by the LTTE, that the TNA as the political paw of the LTTE, and that the TNA was formed by the LTTE were not true and highly exaggerated. Some leading politicians were running with the hare and hunting with the hound and exploiting the LTTE for their own political advantage were all very true. 
According to Taraki the Several interest groups in the North East, particularly the Thamilar Marumalarchchi Kalaham in Batticaloa, began a campaign for Tamil political unity as soon as dates for the December 2001 General Elections were announced, and that these lobbies felt that all Tamil parties and groups in the North East should be brought under one Tamil national umbrella regardless of their deep divisions and regardless of their long association with the military and allegations of rights abuses, clearly show that the initial moves were taken by the TULF to start an alliance was, modified by Taraki and many other organizations interested in the unity of the Tamil people. 
In reference to an unidentified TULF stalwart Taraki had said When the matter was discussed with a Tamil United Liberation Front stalwart who used to persistently claim during the war years that he had close links with the LTTE, he strongly objected to the TELO and the EPRLF joining the proposed alliance. He simply dismissed the matter, claiming that the Tigers were completely opposed to the two groups contesting the elections under the Tamil national umbrella. Also, at that time this TULF politician was in the habit of saying that he was constantly in touch with the LTTEs political advisor, Mr. Anton Balasingham. However, it transpired later the TULF politician was lying. 
Taraki had refuted the claim of the said TULF stalwart that, Karikalan, a senior Tiger leader in the East, told a delegation of the Thamilar Marumalarchchi Kalaham in Batticaloa that the LTTE had no objection at all to the TELO and the EPRLF joining the alliance but was very keen that the two groups should be brought under the Tamil National umbrella as soon as possible. He was also eager that POLTE too should join the TNA. This was at a time when PLOTE, EPRLF and TELO were officially working with the Sri Lanka army in intelligence and counter insurgency operations in the North East. 
Taraki further writes about the LTTEs strategic reasons, Balasingams request regarding two organizations, how after several rounds of talks in Colombo, the alliance was about to be cemented, the ACTC decided to throw the spanner in the works, how the ACTC insisted in contesting the Jaffna district on its own and that it would be part of the alliance in the other districts, how with only a few days left for nomination the TNA looked as though it was going to fall apart and how months of hard work by many organizations was about to become nought. 
Referring to the ACTC Taraki said, It wants to preserve its individual historic identity and maintain its uniqueness, stronger and also that the party may have apprehensions about being subsumed under the TULFs Rising Sun symbol. The TULF itself is the result of the Political merger between the FP and ACTC. In 1976 Tamil parties were asked to surrender their individual identities for the sake of Tamil unity. The FP gave up its long established house symbol when the rising sun was adopted by the Tamil national unity that emerged at the Vaddukoddai Conference that year. The ACTC and the FP were supposed to have been subsumed by the new political identity of the TULF.
That is why one time ACTC stalwarts like M. Sivasithamparam and Anandasangaree continued their political careers with the new political identity that they accepted with the forging of the TULF. Federal Party leaders gave up their established political identity when the TULF was launched. Today the FP exists only on paper. 
It was only at the eleventh hour that ACTC was persuaded to contest under the common rising sun symbol and also that the Tamil National Alliance should contest only on the basis of its common symbol and policy is the overwhelming opinion among Tamil nationalist interest groups this time. The sentiment was strongly echoed in the unanimous decision of the Trincomalee district branch of the Tamil National Alliance on Monday. Obviously this is the wish of the LTTE too (although Kilinochchi remains mum on the matter). 
A close study of Tarakis article clearly reveals how foolishly the TNA leaders had handled the ethnic issue which is the main stumbling block for the progress of the country. We had several opportunities that came on our way, all of which failed on flimsy grounds. A very rare and a good opportunity was made available to us to reach a solution in 2004. Whether we succeeded in it or not is a different matter but the question is whether we tried it honestly. 
Taraki did not announce with pleasure, to all those who had worked hard to find a solution for the ethnic problem that, Kilinochchi alone kept mum. No one can deny that Kilinochchi keeping mum, ultimately brought destruction to the LTTE, thousands of innocent lives lost and many such other pathetic and tragic incidents had taken place. Tarakis ultimate plea to all is that All Tamil parties must give up their identities and get united under one banner and on one policy. 
I hope those who maintained mum in Kilinochchi would at least now open their mouths and speak out.
