Discipline the Buddhist monks who deviate from Vinaya
	
Nikini is for restraining Sangha through a Dhamma Council
Monks staging a protest in Colombo
Elder Maha Kassapas Nikini Full Moon Dear Kassapa, please advise these Bhikkhus and guide them from faltering in their code of conduct. You must please counsel them regularly, now. Preach them the Dhamma too. Or else, I myself will have to do so. -Lord Buddha.
O Lord, these Bhikkhus are now highly indisciplined. They are not amenable to correction. They often resort to their own ways. They do not show obedience or patience. They are not willing to abide by advice given to them for their own welfare and progress; instead they often misconstrue and misunderstand it. -The First Sangayanawa [Convocation] was held onNikini Poya 
Bhikkhu Subhadda believed that the Buddha had been curtailing their freedom. The Thera, who became a monk in his old age, advised the mourning monks to celebrate the Parinibbana of the Buddha. Celebrate brothers, said Subaddha. He asked them not to weep, but, be happy that now they can do what they want, The Master is no more; we are now free. 
O Lord, these Bhikkhus are now highly undisciplined. They are not amenable to correction. They often resort to their own ways. They do not show obedience...
Just 21 days after the Parinibbana of Buddha, Arahant Maha Kassapa decided that a great council must be held with the commencement of the rains retreat for the Sangha. It was held three months after the demise of the Buddha, at Sattapanni Rock Cave in Rajagaha, under the patronage of King Ajasatta. All matters concerning organising, planning and conducting were done under the auspices of Elder Maha Kassapa Maha Thera. 
The council was attended by 499 Arahant Theras at the beginning and Ven. Mahakassapa Thera kept the 500th seat vacant for Ven. Ananda Thera, who attained Arahanthship on this Nikini Poya Day. The great Theravada Buddhist tradition flourishing today in countries such as Sri Lanka, Thailand, Burma, Laos and Cambodia had its beginnings in the first Council. 
Maha Kassapa Thera sent a message to all the participants, which conveyed that they should assemble in the hall constructed in front of Sapta Parni Cave.  In the morning Arahants took their seats according to seniority, in the gaily decorated hall. Arahant Upali, chief among Vinaya experts, took a seat especially arranged in the centre and in reply to Maha Kassapa; he collated the disciplinary code [VinayaPitake] 
Being abused and exploited at Buddhist religious rituals; surprisingly, at Buddhist Peraheras, the majestic pachyderms are made to walk miles on hot tarred roads...
Next, Arahant Ananda Thera took that special seat. As questioned and guided by Maha Kassapa Thera, he collated the entire code of Dhamma covering all five Nikayas. It was well known that all of those five hundred Arahants were experts on Dhamma and Vinaya.  Having come to the end of the first Sangayana [Council], Elder Maha Kassapa entrusted the responsibility of preserving through memorizing and passing down to posterity, all the books of the entire code on Vinaya [discipline] to the chief of Discipline, Arahant Upali Mahathera and his retinue of pupils.  Similarly, the responsibility of memorizing and preserving, and passing down to posterity all of the thirty four long discourses grouped as Dighanikaya to Arahant Ananda Thera and his retinue of pupils. The Middle length discourses [Majjimanikaya] to Elder Sari Putta Thera and his pupils. The Samyuktha Nikaya, to himself and his pupils, while the Anguttra Nikaya to Arahant Anuruddha Thera and his pupils.  Foremost Place, Protect, Responsibility Entrusted by Constitutional Charter 
Foremost place and the responsibility guaranteed by Constitutional Charter to the Government through Clause 9 which reads as: 
The Republic of Sri Lanka shall give to Buddhism the foremost place and accordingly it shall be the duty of the State to protect and foster the Buddha Sasana, while assuring protectionto all religions, the rights granted by Articles 10 and 14(1)(e). 
The Government, in a sense, is given a free hand through this clause to act, directly intervene, question, acquire, obstruct, and proceed in any manner as it perceives as appropriate to preserve and uphold the moral behaviour of individuals, control of properties and financial discipline in relation to matters that lead to the protection, safety and fostering of the Buddha Sasana.  It is rather depressing to learn that successive Governments had been guilty of dereliction of the sacred duty by the Sasana, even ignoring the Constitutional provision that the Buddhists had always clamoured for the inclusion and retention during compilation of a new Constitution. 
Attempts by constitutional experts to delete the above provision from the nations basic law under the pretext of instituting a Secular State had been met with severe opposition from Maha Sangha and virtuous Buddhists, rather Sinhala-Buddhists. 
Anujanami Bhikkave Vassane Vassan Udaganja - I advise oh monks! To observe the rainy retreat during the Rainy Season, under one roof.  It is the foremost duty of the Government to pick up all those young saffron robe-clad monks parading the streets with lay students, at least during the rainy retreat four months. Senior Monks who engage in politics, conduct media shows decorate political rallies with their saffron robes should be rounded up and handed over to the Nayake Theras for further action. 
Placing Buddhism above other faiths and ensuring foremost or privileged status to it for the simple reason that it is the religion of seventy percent of Lankans ignites a reverse process.  This is totally against the principles of Dhamma, which are based on teachings of Buddha. The problem here is the superficial manner in which most of us have grasped the profound and unfathomable teachings of Buddhism.  One of the most sacred ethical principles of Dhamma is equality and compassion. 
Buddhism injects equality by the very sentence that tells to show sympathy and care for all beings. 
Buddhism does not encourage special treatment to a particular group, sect, sex or religion. Any type of discrimination based on race, caste, academic success, social status, position, wealth, power has no place in the Sasana.  Another major teaching in Buddhism is the inter-woven and interdependent nature of all things. So, there is no possibility of anything that can be unequal to anything else.
Nayake Theras de facto State 
Issuing two controversial statements in quick succession, the Asgiriya Chapter of Siam Nikaya and the Tri Nikaya Mahanayake Theras [Chief monks of the three Buddhist Nikayas] gave notice to the Government warning against inaugurating a new Constitution as if they were being entrusted the task of running the country in parallel to the de jure State: It is a high-handed act by the prelates who failed to summon the political authority for talks prior to the release. 
Kandy Esala Perahera faces elephant crisis News item 
This day has a special significance since the annual Kandy Esala Perahera ends on Nikini Poya. This famous Perahera, as anyone who has seen and had the opportunity to witness it will tell you, is indeed an experience in itself and should not be missed. 
Traditional rituals and slaughter of animals had been taking place for a long time. Whatever the purpose behind it, this is a barbaric act. Some religious leaders opted to kill animals to satisfy the Gods. In performing traditional rituals so many women had been burned alive just because they lost their husbands-[Sathi] . These rituals have to be changed as the world advances.  The news further says: 
This years Kandy Esala Perahera will be without its star attractions the tuskers Nadungamuwe Raja, Wasana and Kelaniye Raja, while two other tuskers belonging to the Sri Dalada Maligawa would not take apart in the Perahera. 
The Maligawa officials said Nadungamuwa Raja and Wasana were among the elephants at the Kataragama Perahera while Kelaniye Raja would not be available for the Kandy Perahera beginning on July 29. He said usually three elephants were required to carry the sacred relic caskets, whereas only two other elephants would take part in the Perahera.  Elephants form profound family bonds and live in firm matriarchal family groups of related females called a herd. 
The herd is led by the oldest and often chief female in the herd, called a matriarch. Elephant calves and young elephants are being chained, roped and stretched, and hit with bull hooks. This is done to weaken the animals spirit so that they would comply with humans. The elephants often display signs of crippling injuries with brutal attacks.  Biologists say with the help of the sensory cells in the feet of elephants, the vibrations pass through their bodies to their ear drums. [They even use these vibrations to be in touch with each other over fair distances.]  Being abused and exploited at Buddhist religious rituals; surprisingly, at Buddhist Peraheras, the majestic pachyderms are made to walk miles on hot tarred roads, the cheapest mode of transport, which is extremely harmful to these nerve endings. This happens during long walks from home to temple abodes that help the organizers of such events to accumulate a-kusala kamma! 
The news is encouraging; let them have even fewer animals next year. This callous disregard for the wellbeing of innocent animals in the name of the Buddha, the Great Compassionate One has to be stopped forthwith. May all beings be happy!

EC not in favour of postponing polls: Chairman
	
Against the backdrop of the government drafting two Bills which, if enacted, would make way for the postponement of the Provincial Council Elections due this year, the Election Commission said it was not in favour of withholding elections even through a parliamentary process.
Its Chairman Mahinda Deshapriya told Daily Mirror the Commission was bound to act according to the laws brought by Parliament.
However, he said the Commission was opposed to postponing due elections in any way or form as it was against the norms and principles of democracy. He said this had been outlined by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
Mr. Deshapriya quoted Article 21 of the Declaration that says, The will of the people shall be the basis of the authority of government; this will shall be expressed in periodic and genuine elections which shall be by universal and equal suffrage and shall be held by secret vote or by equivalent free voting procedures.
He had this to say, We are not faithful to the political parties. But, we, the Election Commission, are loyal to democracy.(Kelum Bandara)

Kandy Esala Perahera  The prestigious pageant in the hill capital
	
The prestigious Sri Dalada Perahera in Kandy is celebrated in honour of the sacred Tooth Relic of Gautama Buddha and the four guardian gods, Natha, Vishnu, Kataragama and goddess Pattini.
In keeping with the terms of the Kandyan convention of 1815, the custody of the Sacred Tooth Relic was handed over to the Buddhist clergy. In the absence of a king a lay custodian called Diyawadana Nilame, was appointed to handle the routine matters relating to the Sacred Tooth Relic. 
Pageant conducted to beseech the blessings of the guardian Gods 
In the past the pageant was conducted in a bid to beseech the blessings of the guardian Gods for rains to come for the cultivation of paddy and other crops and to enrich the lands of the Kingdom. Later on the pageant was improved by the inclusion of the Sri Dalada Maligawa Esala Perahera (the pageant to honour the Sacred Tooth Relic) which is conducted to commemorate the first discourse - Dhammacakkapavattana Sutta expounded by the Enlightened One on Esala Poya Day. 
The oldest, grandest and the noblest procession in Asia. The Sinhalese term for the pageant is Perahera meaning a parade of musicians, dancers singers, acrobats...
This is supposed to be the oldest, grandest and the noblest procession in Asia. The Sinhalese term for the pageant is Perahera meaning a parade of musicians, dancers singers, acrobats, torch bearers (illuminators), Sesath carriers, accompanied by a large number of caparisoned tuskers and elephants parading the streets in celebration of the religious event. In the past the number of tuskers and elephants participating in the Perahera had been increasing year by year but this year a decline in the number of tuskers is likely due to the shortage of elephants that provide majesty to this religious event. 
On all five days of Kumbal Perahera and those of the Randoli perahera the processions begin from the Mahawahalkada where the Tusker-Jambo carrying the Relic Casket kneels down and pays respect to the Sacred Tooth Relic.
Then the procession sets off at the auspicious moment amidst the utterances of Sadhu- the expression of piety and devotion, The commencement of the procession is indeed an awe inspiring moment especially due to the high esteem with which casket of the Sacred Tooth Relic is held by the prelates of Asgiriya and Malwatte Viharayas and the well mannered behaviour of the Maligawa tusker. 
Recently an improved dress has been designed to caparison the elephants to traverse streets. This costume consists of three parts viz. the body part, the forehead garland- Netti Malaya and the ear ornament- Kan Joduwa Large quantities of foam Rubber, unbleached cloth, velvet and coral etc. are required to make this dress. The body part is decorated with traditional artwork using mostly the Lotus flower. Netti Mala is made up of brass work called Bokkala each costing about Rs. 6,000/=. They are manufactured in areas such as Pilimatalawa, Gadaladeniya, Ambekke and Matale.

The Lesser Buddha
	
Monks, when worldlings with defilements speak in praise of Thathagatha they do of just a fraction of the elementary virtues of His, the basics of His morality (sila) within their mundane knowledge said Buddha in Brahmajala Sutta.
If that fraction, the basics are anything to go by, it takes no effort at all to fathom the fuller individual that was Sakyamuni Gautama Sri Samma Sambuddha, the fully enlightened Master of earth and the heavens. He is called Thathagatha by virtue of seven unique features, possessed by none other whosoever.
Said He:
If those mundane humans were to speak of His qualities, they would say thus; The Fortunate, the Samana Gautama has abandoned the taking of life, abstains from cruelty to living beings, does not take up arms, is ashamed of evil conduct, is kind and compassionate towards one and all, The Samana Gautama refrains from taking what is not offered, accepts what is offered with a pure heart. He lives a chaste life, devoid of sensual pleasures, sexual misconduct and debase livelihood. He refrains from falsehood, speaks the absolute truth, what is believable; He is no deceiver of the world. He does not indulge in malicious speech that tends to estrange people, unites those that are. He considers unity is foremost, is happy of those that are united. He refrains from harsh speech, always speaks pleasant, friendly words that evoke felicity. He is equally free of empty, futile words, speaks what is truthful and benevolent at the proper time and place with apt similes and analogies that help nurture restraint of the senses and facilitate onesinward development.
He refrains from destroying plants, grasses and trees. He abstains from watching dancing, singing and theatre, does not wear garlands and perfumes nor uses inappropriate chairs as seats. He avoids accepting gold, silver and money. Neither does Fortunate Samana Gautama accept raw grain and meat nor women and girls. He refrains from accepting slaves, goats, lamb, poultry, swine, elephants, cattle and horses, nor does He accept paddy fields and lands.
The mundane would also say ascetic Gautama does not run errands, transact business or engage in trade....
The mundane would also say ascetic Gautama does not run errands, transact business or engage in trade, use weighted scales and short measures, accept bribes, cheat and hoodwink people. Likewise he refrains from injuring, torturing, trussing up, robbing and plundering villages, committing acts of thuggery.
Monks, worldlings with defilements would further say that Samana Gautama does not, unlike certain other ascetics and Brahmins having partaken of alms of the faithful, resort to destruction of grasses, trees and creepers germinated by seeds., roots, stems, joints and cuttings. He does not store food and drinks, nor hoards linen, furniture, perfume, sesame seed and grain for later use,
While still others feeding on the food of the devotees lend an ear to humorous anecdotes, watch musical performances and magic shows such as making dead bodies rise from the grave, watch stage plays, play of drums and cymbals, watch elephant combats and fights between horses, bulls, goats, rams, cockerels and quails, witness such comical sights as wrestling bouts, boxing matches, games played with balls, wars being waged, inspection of battalions and military camps, Samana Gothama refrains from viewing such void displays.
Whereas some ascetics are addicted to pleasurable pursuits like games of chess played on boards and in the air, hopscotch, spillikins, games of dice, pipe blowing and doing somersaults, playing with toy ploughs, cars and windmills, bows and arrows, indulge in guessing games concerning letters and thoughts and mimicking people with deformities, ascetic Gothama refrains from such hollow practices. Certain ascetics remain addicted to high and wide beds and couches with awnings adorned with elaborate carvings and ornaments, covered with plush gold and silk coverlets, whereas Samana Gautama refrains from the use of such items. Whereas certain ascetics and Brahmins feeding on the food given by the faithful have their bodies perfumed, caressed, bathed in scented water, massaged, watch their images on mirrors, wear bracelets, cosmetics, gems, headbands, turbans, sandals and shoes, long white robes and talismans, ascetic Gothama abstains from such self-adornment
and pampering.
Certain other ascetics having partaken of alms offered by the faithful indulge in thirty two types of meaningless drivel about kings, ministers, thieves, armies and wars, consumables, carriages, towns, cities and nations, on women, heroic deeds of men, of the departed ones and speculation of matters of land and sea, whereas Samana Gothama refrains from such idle chatter.
