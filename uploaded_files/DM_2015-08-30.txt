Golden opportunity for SL refugees in India to return: OfERR
	
	Given the prevailing political situation in Sri Lanka, the time has come for Sri Lankan Tamil refugees in Tamil Nadu to return home, said S. C. Chandrahasan, founder of the Organisation for Eelam Refugees Rehabilitation (OfERR).
	It is a golden opportunity for the refugees to return home especially when there is an effort to form a national government in Sri Lanka. The time has come to reap the benefits of our blood-stained struggle, he told The Hindu in Chennai.
	Tamil Nadu is home to more than one hundred thousand Tamil refugees from Sri Lanka, with over 60,000 of them residing in a hundred camps spread across the State.
	Asked whether the refugees were ready for return, Mr. Chandrahasan said though they had some reservations, assistance from the governments of Tamil Nadu and India to start their life in Sri Lanka would convince them to return to their homeland.
	The Tamil Nadu government is already rendering a lot of help. They can continue to provide support at least for one year till our people find their feet in Sri Lanka, Mr. Chandrahasan said. OfERR had already held 17 rounds of talks with the refugees before presenting their case to External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj and officials of the ministry about the return of the refugees. The Sri Lankan government also was very keen on their return as 3,800 graduates among the refugees would be of great resource for the country.
	Mr. Chandrahasan said already over 10,000 people had returned to Sri Lankan on their own. However, politically too, their return was very important to the Tamil community. We have lost two MPs in the Northern Provinces because of lack of Tamil population. Our return also will make up for the loss, he said. Noting that the present dispensation in the island nation had the support of former Sri Lankan President Chandrika Kumaratunga, he said the Special Presidential Commission that she heads on finding a solution to the problems of the Tamil community was a ray of hope. Mr. Chandrahasan said though he had plans to enter politics he was delaying it for the sake of the refugees.

Hit and run vehicle kills leopardess in Yala
	
The carcass of a young female leopard was found inside the Yala National Park reportedly a victim of another hit and run tragedy. The authorities had received reports of several animals being killed by careless drivers transporting visitors on safari.
Wild Life Department Director General H.D. Ratnayake told Daily Mirror that the carcass of the three year-old leopardess was found yesterday with its spinal cord badly injured.
He said the loss of a Leopardess would endanger the species roaming the Yala sanctuary and added several hit and run incidents had taken place in its vicinity with about eight deer being killed.
Mr. Ratnayake said he would request the Road Development Authority (RDA) to set up a method of speed control to monitor the motorists who drive from Kirinda Junction to the Yala sanctuary entrance.
With the intention of strengthening the safety of animals, our department took action to disconnect mobile networks for visitors within the Yala National Park from July 20 to September 6 because it has been found that some careless visitors had driven their vehicles fast to reach rare animals after receiving text messages from other visitors, who randomly notice rare animals such as leopards. We have taken legal action against those involved in accidents, he said. (Piyumi Fonseka)

It's up to Mayadunne to decide: JVP
	
The Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) said today there was some doubt about former Auditor General Sarathchandra Mayadunne accepting his appointment to parliament from the JVP national list after he expressed reservations about it.
JVP General Secretary Tilvin Silva said Mr. Mayadunne, though had not officially mentioned anything about it, appeared reluctant to work with those appointed to parliament by other political parties through their national lists.
In case he resigns we will appoint another sutiable member through the JVP's national list. But no decision has been taken yet because Mr. Mayadunne is still our nominee, Mr. Silva said.
Apprehensive about an opposition made up of a political party representing the government functioning as the opposition, Mr. Silva said the JVP would do its best to function as the real opposition in the 15th parliament which would meet for the first time tomorrow.
Mr. Silva told Daily Mirror the JVP would support the UNP-led unity government to pass all people-friendly Bills but would not hesitate to speak out and oppose any Bills that would be detrimental for the country and the people. (SAJ)

Oppon. must select opposition leader: Wimal
	
	President Maithripala Sirisena should not appoint the Opposition Leader but it should be based on the consent of the majority of opposition MPs so that the opposition could function in a proper manner, National Freedom Front (NFF) Leader Wimal Weerawansa said today.
	He told the media that if the President appointed a parliamentarian of his choice to the post of Opposition Leader, it would be the beginning of President Sirisena acting as a dictator.
	People accused former president Mahinda Rajapaksa of acting as a dictator even though he did not meddle in the affairs of the opposition. I ask the Purawesi Balaya members to give me a name to call the current leader. The President should not decide the role of the Opposition in the Parliament. It is ridiculous for him to appoint the prime minister, the ministers, the opposition leader and the chief opposition whip. Where is the much-hyped democracy in the 'Yahapalana' government Mr. Weerawansa asked. (Piyumi Fonseka)

Video: Ranil stops demolition of old buildings in City
	
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has ordered the Urban Development Authority (UDA) to stop demolishing old buildings in Colombo City.
Mr Wickremesinghe speaking to the media after touring Colombo City today said he had done so as the policy of the new government was to preserve the old buildings in Colombo and repair them while keeping them as they were.
However, he said, opportunities would be given to investors to open new hotels in the city -- in keeping with the policy of President Maithripala Sirisena.
Colombo was a famous city in the past, and the intention of the new government is to bring back this glory,'" he said.
Referring to the political situation, Mr. Wickremesinghe said he had decided to go in for a joint government with the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) despite an offer by some SLFPers to cross over and enable him to form a UNP government in order to bring about a new political culture. He said former president Mahinda Rajapaksa had also welcomed a UNP plus SLFP government.
He promised that before long justice would be done by those UNPers who made a sacrifice to form a joint government.
"Uniting the UNP and SLFP is the first step towards turning the whole of parliament into one government," he said, pointing out that he had made such a promise before the elections. (Yohan Perera)
