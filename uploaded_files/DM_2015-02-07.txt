Video: Super luxury meditation center found: Ranjan
	
		Deputy Minister Ranjan Ramanayake along with the Police has raided a super luxury meditation center, which he alleges is worth over Rs. 1000 million and was used by the Rajapaksas.
	
	Minister Ramanayake speaking to Daily Mirror said he accompanied a team of journalists from a private media institution who had received news of the luxury meditation center located in Imbulgoda, Kadawatha, as they had not been allowed to enter the premises earlier.
	No expenses had been spared in planning and constructing this meditation center that is spread over eight acres. It is fully-fledged complete with ebony furnishings, a massive library, Italian bathroom fittings and a helipad, he said.
	Ramanayake says up until January 8, a team of over 60 army personnel had been stationed in and around the center to provide security but added that on the day of the raid, only three of them were stationed.
	According to him, the premises are believed to have been the abode of King Walagamba.
	We suspect that treasure hunting had also taken place at this location; there is a massive crater on one side of the premises and some of the villagers had seen equipment that might have been used to dig up the treasure, being transported into the meditation center, he added.
	However, a monk who claimed to be the administrator of the meditation center dismissed the claims made by the Deputy Minister and said the premises are being constructed by him and has no link to the Rajapaksas. (Lakna Paranamanna)WATCH
