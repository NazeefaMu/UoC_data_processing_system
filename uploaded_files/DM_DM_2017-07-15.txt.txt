Amunugama castigates FCID for probe on Dinesh
	
Special Assignments Minister Sarath Amunugama had at Tuesday's Cabinet meeting vehemently opposed the ongoing FCID investigations on joint opposition leader Dinesh Gunawardana.
These investigations on a veteran politician who is known for his integrity and fair play and commands respect in parliament and outside should not have been initiated in the first place, he is reported to have said.
The FCID should have carried out an evaluation before questioning him over some activities at the National Water Supply and Drainage Board (NWSDB) when he was the subject minister previous government. Those transactions have been carried out by NWSDB officials and not by him, the minister said. "If the FCID continues to question such respected opposition politicians it is bound to further lose its credibility among the people."
The attack by the minister on the FCID came in the wake of a large number of ministers led by President Maithripala Sirisena expressing their displeasure and disappointment over the speed of the FCID investigations.
They were of the view that the FCID was extremely slow and lethargic in carrying out investigations into financial frauds that were carried out by big-time criminals while hounding out those involved in minor offenses. (Sandun A Jayasekera)

Bush and Clinton lecture Trump
	

US, (Daily Mail), Bush and Clinton - 
George W Bush and Bill Clinton both took apparent jabs at Donald Trump at a forum on Thursday night as they named the one characteristic a president needed above all others. 
The two former presidents were speaking at a graduation ceremony for the Presidential Leadership Scholars program at the George W Bush Presidential Center in Dallas. 
Bush replied humility in answer to the question about presidential qualities, and added  I think its really important to know what you dont know and listen to people who do know what you dont know.Clinton said anyone holding the highest office in the land needs to keep focused on their goals.  Realize its about the people, not you, he said. A lot of these people who are real arrogant in office,
they forget. 
You dont want to say, God, look at all those people I beat.

China hits back at criticism over Nobel laureates death
	
SHENYANG AFP July14, 2017 
China lashed out Friday at international criticism after it denied Nobel laureate Liu Xiaobos dying wish to leave the country and faced pressure to set the democracy champions widow free. 
Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said Beijing lodged official protests with the United States, France, Germany and the United Nations human rights office over their irresponsible remarks regarding Liu Xiaobo, and he took aim at his Nobel status. 
Conferring the prize to such a person goes against the purposes of this award. Its a blasphemy of the peace prize, he told reporters.

Mass brawl breaks out in Taiwanese parliament
	
Taiwan, (daily Mail), 13 July 2017 - 
Two MPs got into a shocking brawl on live television as tensions over a Parliamentary debate boiled over. 
The pair exchanged slaps and tried to strangle each other during a session to discuss the islands plans for infrastructure reform. 
The fracas broke out while opposing MPs from the Kuomintang (KMT) party chanted protests against President Tsai Ing-wens plan. 
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) lawmaker Chiu Yi-ying, 46, walked up to the group of MPs and began arguing. 
KMT MP Hsu Shu-hua, 41, responded in kind. 
The two women scuffled and Chiu was even slapped across the face, leaving President of the Legislative Yuan, Su Chia-chyuan, repeatedly calling for calm and order.Everyone is watching, Su can be heard saying. 
The KMT protest was prompted by claims the 420 billion TWD (10.7 billion) reform favoured cities and counties loyal to the ruling DPP.

New mosquito species spreading dengue
	
A new species of mosquito, Aedes Aegypti Type-2' which has developed resistance to fogging, BTI and other dengue control methods was the reason for the most number of dengue cases this year, Government Epidemiology Unit's Dengue Control Unit Director Dr. Hasitha Tissera said.
He said as of yesterday the number of patients had increased to 89,885 with 269 deaths.
Dr. Tissera told reporters that though there was a slight decrease in reported dengue cases countrywide, the mosquito density was on the rise with the sporadic rains.
He said 136 deaths and 37,981 dengue patients were from the Western Province with Southern Province reporting 24 deaths and 10,709 patients while Sabaragamuwa Province reported 27 deaths and 9,688 patients.
Dr. Tissera said 30% of the dengue victims were schoolchildren and 50% were between 15 and 46 years of age.
Weakening of acquired immunity, viral infection outside residence, older age and extensive dengue reaction methods contribute to the epidemic. However, early detection through blood tests and early hospital treatment will help dengue patients to recover speedily, he said.
Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne said dengue control is entirely a community-based exercise and therefore the people together and individually must act responsibly to end the dengue menance.
Countries like Cuba and Pakistan have controlled dengue with the cooperation of the armed forces and strict laws. But in a democracy like Sri Lanka we cannot do that because people invade the streets and public establishments for no reason at all, he said.
The minister said 'Aedes Aegypti' was difficult to be destroyed through fogging, BTI or other methods. The government is trying other options like introducing a larva-eating mosquito.
He rejected certain media reports that there were 400,000 dengue patients and added this figure has been mentioned by someone with a demented mentality.
Doctors L. Fernando, Amitha Ginige and Ananda Wijewickrama also spoke. (Sandun A Jayasekera)

Sri Lanka Rupavahini Corporation (SLRC) ex-chairman Ariyaratne Athugala, ex additional director general Devapriya Abeysinghe and G.D. Sugathapala yesterday apologised to the three employees who had complained that they had been threatened and assaulted in 2010.
When the cases were taken up before Colombo Chief Magistrate Lal Ranasinghe Bandara the parties had agreed to resolve this matter amicably.
During the previous hearing the three complainants Ravi Abeywickrema, Herbert Kumara Alagiyawanna and Kanchana Marasinghe in their evidence led by Cinnamon Gardens Police Sergeant Mendis in the Chief Magistrate's Court said Mr. Athugala had threatened them saying he was not be bothered about any Supreme Court order.
When the three cases were taken up for hearing, the complainants had mentioned that they were threatened and assaulted by the suspects for following the Election Commissioners guidelines in line with the SC order with regard to telecasting of election-related programmes during the 2010 presidential election.
They said the former SLRC chairman abused them in obscene language saying there was no need to teach him about handling the media.
Counsel Gunaratne Wanninayake appeared for the complainants while W. Dayaratne PC and H.R. Perera PC appeared for the suspects. (Yoshitha Perera)

Amid plans by some of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) MPs to leave the government, Partys General Secretary and Agriculture Minister, Duminda Dissanayake said everyone should honour the agreement signed with the United National Party (UNP) to administer the country for two years.
He told Daily Mirror the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) stipulated two years for the two sides to be together in the government.
The SLFP, as a party, signed this agreement. It is not an individual decision. Therefore, it has to be honoured till the expiry of the stipulated period on December 31, the minister said and added that the party could decide on the next move after that date.
He said that was why President Maithripala Sirisena asked all members to remain in government till December 31. (Kelum Bandara)

Dallas residents were told to collect their medicines, pets and lock their houses before fleeing the toxic smoke that swirled overhead. 
Over 115 homes have been impacted by the blaze. 
The inferno broke out on Thursday morning after firefighters extinguished a smaller blaze made of paper and plastic. Factory staff and nearby businesses were earlier evacuated, and a community relief centre established in Broadmeadows after smoke poured across Melbournes north.

UN rapporteur urges Govt. to repeal PTA
	
While calling for the replacement of the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA), UN Special Rapporteur Ben Emmerson yesterday asked the government not to allow the process of accountability to be diverted by retrograde elements in security establishments and their allies in Government.
Mr. Emmerson, the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms while countering terrorism, arrived in Sri Lanka on Sunday on an invitation by the government.
He told a news briefing held at the UN compound in Colombo, that the purpose of his visit was to assess the progress Sri Lanka had made in its law, policies and practice in the fight against terrorism as measured against international human rights law.
Referring to the findings of his mission, Mr. Emmerson said practices of torture were very deeply ingrained in the security sector and all of the evidence points to the conclusion that the use of torture has been, and today remains endemic and routine, for those arrested and detained on national security grounds.
Torture in Sri Lanka is one of the worst in the world that I have witnessed. During my interviews with current and former PTA detainees, I heard distressing stories of extremely brutal methods of torture, including beatings with sticks, the use of stress positions, asphyxiation using plastic bags drenched in kerosene, the pulling out of fingernails, the insertion of needles beneath the fingernails, the use of various forms of water torture, the suspension of individuals for several hours by their thumbs, and the mutilation of genitals. In a number of instances, these allegations had either been supported by independent medical evidence, or accepted by the judiciary as the basis for excluding a confession at trial, he said and added that since the authorities use the PTA disproportionately against members of the Tamil community, it was this community that has borne the brunt of the States well-oiled torture apparatus.
Mr. Emmerson said he was extremely concerned to learn that 80 per cent of those most recently arrested under the PTA in late 2016 complained of torture and physical ill-treatment following their arrest, in cases which were later dealt with under ordinary criminal law.
Through a combination of extended executive detention and grossly protracted criminal proceedings, he said suspects arrested under the PTA have commonly been held in detention, in conditions that amount to inhuman and degrading treatment, for many years without ever having been found guilty of anything and without any effective judicial review of their detention.
He said he also met a significant cross section of individuals detained under the PTA and he was given statistics from which it is apparent that out of 81 prisoners currently in the judicial phase of their pretrial detention, 70 had been in detention without trial for over five years and 12 had been in detention without trial for over 10 years.
This entire PTA system, as it has operated until now, and continues to operate in those current cases to which it applies, amounts to a flagrant denial of justice, Mr. Emmerson said.
He reminded that the Sri Lankan Government had committed to repeal the PTA and to replace it with anti-terrorism legislation in accordance with contemporary international best practices through Human Rights Council resolution 30/1 adopted in 2015.
However, many of those who spoke to the Special Rapporteur had expressed dismay at the lack of ministerial, parliamentary or public consultation over the proposals.
Even the Human Rights Commission has not been informed or consulted on the draft framework. Nonetheless, the present draft makes some significant improvements. However, there are a number of central flaws in the current framework draft which, if enacted, would guarantee the continued violation of the human rights of terrorism suspects, he said.
Mr. Emmerson said the progress of this legislation to date has been painfully slow, and this has, in turn, delayed the wider package of transitional justice measures that Sri Lanka committed to deliver two years ago. It is difficult to resist the conclusion that this inertia reflects the continuing influence of certain vested interests in the security sector, who are resistant to change, and above all, to accountability, he said.
Referring to the UNHRC resolution which was co-sponsored by Sri Lanka and the commitments made by the country through this resolution, Mr. Emmerson said, Two years on, and already four months into a two-year extension granted to the Government by the Human Rights Council, progress in achieving the key goals set out in the Resolution is not only slow, but seems to have ground to a virtual halt. None of the measures so far adopted to fulfil Sri Lankas transitional justice commitments are adequate to ensure real progress, and there is little evidence that perpetrators of war crimes committed by members of the Sri Lankan armed forces are being brought to justice,
Responding to journalists he said it was highly questionable and uncertain whether Sri Lanka could deliver on its promises within the two-year extension and said there could be repercussions, if it failed to deliver promises. There comes a point where patience runs out, Mr. Emmerson said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

UN Special Rapporteur lacks calibre, diplomacy: Minister
	
Justice Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe yesterday alleged that several UN Special Rapporteurs who visited Sri Lanka including Rapporteur Ben Emmerson lacked calibre and diplomacy and that he would inform the President and the Premier about these Rapporteurs.
When contacted by the Daily Mirror to get a comment about the Rapporteur Emmersons visit, the Minister complained that Mr. Emmerson didnt have any diplomatic qualities, basic courtesy and that he displayed an-army-commander-like approach.
Even during our meeting, he came up with false facts about those detained under the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA). When I questioned about the sources of his facts, he only said the sources were reliable. I rejected his facts with factual sources, he said.
He said the Special Rapporteur (SR) questioned him about admissibility of suspects and detainees confessions in Sri Lankan legal system.
I reminded him that confessions are admissible in UK as well and therefore, invited him to repeal their laws first. Then he queried about the lack of action against armed forces personnel accused of crimes, to which I responded saying we are simply following British Prime Minister Theresa May. She vowed to protect British troops who fought in Iraq from legal abuse, Minister Rajapakshe said.
When questioned about Mr. Emmersons doubts whether Sri Lanka would be able to fulfil pledges made through the UNHRC resolution within the two year extension, he said the government would fulfil the pledges in due time and respond to the UNHRC in terms of delivering them. We dont have to respond to the Rapporteur in this regard, he said.
The minister said former SR Monica Pinto who arrived in Sri Lanka commended the progress made by the government but submitted a report which highly criticized the judiciary of the country.
She also said Tamil are mistreated. These are the type of SRs who visit Sri Lanka today. They lack caliber and have hidden agendas. They think Asians are uneducated and uncivilized and have to follow the West. Very soon, at the available opportunity, I will inform the President, Prime Minister and the Foreign Affairs Minister about the SR Emmerson and Pinto, he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Welikathara -A southern war in the north
	

D. B. Nihalsinhas Welikathara (desert) is back running in our cinemas in digital version. As a long time admirer of this ground-breaking film (both artistically and technically), Im glad about this attempt to introduce a somewhat obscure thriller to todays generation (obscure Ask anyone under 30 if theyve heard of it, and never use the word classic  and in black and white to boot  or theyll keep away in droves). 
The film remains unsurpassed in its examples of dramatic irony. My favourite is when Joe Abeywickrema, as the thuggish Goring mudalali, approaches the unsuspecting Swineetha Weerasinghe, the police superintendants haughty wife recently arrived in Jaffna and enjoying the sea breeze after a drive, walks around her husbands official Peugeot 203, and tells her nonchalantly that it reminds him of lightning-fast Cotton Hall (a famous race horse belonging to the Selvaratnam Stables and trained by Mehi Hussein). Then he lets the air out of a tire and tells her to walk home, enjoying the breeze. 

The idea of this short piece, however, is to discuss Welikatharas politics. Its not a political film. But every film, book, play or piece of music by a serious artist is coloured by the creators politics, more or less
Its hardly a coincidence that, in its final sequence, the young Tamil woman in distress is asked if she needs help by a Sinhalese lorry driver
Sinhala cinema rarely bothered about ethnic representation. Even in its commercial form, it has no equivalent of the Hollywood formula of the black cop-white cop combination

These are among the finest moments in the life of Tissa Abeysekara as a scriptwriter, though he himself didnt think much of them. Talking to me once, he dismissed Welikathara as a mere action film. But I think some of his most inspired moments are here rather in the ponderous epics he made later on as a director. 
The idea of this short piece, however, is to discuss Welikatharas politics. Its not a political film. But every film, book, play or piece of music by a serious artist is coloured by the creators politics, more or less. Tissas politics were leftist, while Nihalsinha could be described as centrist in his politics. They didnt get together to make a political statement in Welikathara. But the underlying political message running through the film, intentional or otherwise, is fascinating nonetheless. 
We know that the Jaffna peninsula has been the historic centre of Tamil politics, culture, religion, commerce and much else down the centuries. But, after watching Welikathara, anyone who doesnt know that might be excused for thinking that Jaffna is just another typical province of Sri Lanka run by the Sinhalese. All major characters are Sinhalese, and Tamils are either smugglers or background characters. In an early action sequence, Fonseka surprises and guns down one. Another scene where he was shown assaulting a suspect in custody was severely cut by the censor. 
No one can call Welikathara a nationalist (or chauvinistic) film. That wasnt the film makers intention. But the existing majority political thinking is ingrained in it like a tattoo on the forehead. All the policemen in it are Sinhalese. Gamini Fonsekas (the police superintendant) personal assistant is a Sinhalese. So are most of his associates at the club, or indeed his principal rival Goring Mudalali. Though Jaffna before its pre-LTTE days was a multi-ethnic society with many Sinhalese traders and bakers living there, baking bread is still a long way away from monopolizing an extortion and smuggling racket. 
Gorings trusted bodyguard is Tamil. But hes just a thug. Goring is the thug who really counts, and hes a Sinhalese. This film has Sinhalese cultural and political complacency written all over it, just as Elephant Walk (1954) has neocolonial complacency written all over it though it isnt a political film at all (no more than a dangerous confrontation between white planters and wild elephants in an exotic setting. The locals dont count). 
All these are very charming films, but the underlying politics need to be put in perspective. The Jaffna peninsula of Welikathara is Sinhalese-dominated. It isnt even explained how a Sinhalese thug could take over the underworld in Jaffna like a southern Siva dancing a macabre dance of death and destruction in an alien land. What were the Tamils doing while Goring was reigning supreme in Jaffna The underworld has its own politics (as many politicians know). 
The Sirima Bandarnaike government introduced the policy of standardization in the early 70s to counter what it saw as discrimination against Sinhalese students at university level. This led to the Tamil students League, said to be inspired by the 1971 JVP insurrection and the first Tamil rebel group to be formed, with Sathyaseelan, Padmanabha and Prabhakaran in its ranks. All this might seem irrelevant in the context of discussing a thriller, but once we know these little details, it becomes very difficult to explain Goring Mudalalis reign in Jaffna. 
After all, Welikathara was released in 1975, the same year in which Jaffnas SLFP major Alfred Durayappah was killed by Prabhakaran. Its hard to ignore these facts when watching Welikathara. A senior policeman in Jaffna cant be ignorant of the militant student politics, but his main concern in the film is smuggling. And at the club, they are listening to Hindi broadcasts from All India Radio. In this context, Welikathara is entirely a southern affair conducted in the placid land of Tamils, where age-old harmony is only interrupted by a little smuggling (again controlled by a Sinhalese). 
Its most interesting to reflect what Welikathara would have been like if Joe Abeywickrema played a Tamil screen personae  instead of a shy Sinhalese village boy whose sister is abused by an upper class young gentleman, if he played the role of a shy Tamil youth (though, given the rigid structure of the pre-war caste-based Jaffna society, its hard to imagine even a Tamil from the south becoming a mafia boss in Jaffna, let alone a Sinhalese who doesnt seem to know much Tamil). In key moments in the film, Joe shouts his commands (wedi thiyapan, yakko) to his Tamil bodyguard in Sinhala! 
Of course one can argue that a film with a strong Tamil character may not have succeeded at the box office as Welikathara did. Sinhala cinema rarely bothered about ethnic representation. Even in its commercial form, it has no equivalent of the Hollywood formula of the black cop-white cop combination, and what Quentin Tarantino has achieved with his Django Unchained (with a black superman cowboy fantasy) is still unthinkable in our context (with a Tamil character in place of an African-American), even after all this mayhem and talk of ethnic harmony and reconciliation. 
None of this is meant to detract from the obvious qualities of Welikathara. Back in 1974-75, few people thought of student militancy, Tamil or Sinhalese, worthy of serious study. After all, as 1971 showed, insurrections could be crushed, and life goes on as usual.
The same complacency hasnt changed in many places even today, even after two bloody southern rebellions and one terrible civil war commenced in the north. One might be excused for thinking that the Sinhalese, whether film makers, politicians, or the military, are perpetually living in the past where Jaffna is concerned.
Even today, when you travel to Jaffna, almost all the policemen and soldiers one is likely to encounter are Sinhalese. Even Asoka Handagamas Ini Awan, a politically more conscious film than Welikathara, failed to take note of this in a very myopic way. Its hardly a coincidence that, in its final sequence, the young Tamil woman in distress is asked if she needs help by a Sinhalese lorry driver. That might be a cutting edge example of ethnic harmony  or a sop to the Sinhalese psyche, relieved at last to hear a few Sinhala words spoken in a strange land.

He also urged the government to immediately release Commodore Dassanayake and the other soldiers who were arrested over this incident.
He expressed his sympathies to the Sri Lankan Navy over this incident and added that the people should stand against the injustice faced by Commodore Dassanayake. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)
