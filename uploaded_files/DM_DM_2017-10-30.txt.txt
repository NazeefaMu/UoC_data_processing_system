At least three dead as storm hits Central Europe
	

PRAGUE AFP Oct29, 2017 - At least three people died in a windstorm that hit central Europe on Sunday, causing widespread power outages and traffic disruptions, rescuers said. 
In the Czech Republic, falling trees killed a woman near the central city of Trebic and an elderly man in Jicin northeast of Prague. 
A driver died in his car in Poland after crashing into a branch that had fallen on the road near the northwestern city of Szczecin, firefighters said. 
The strong winds halted traffic on dozens of railways and several roads across the Czech Republic. Some rivers in the north of the country reached the highest flood-alert levels. At present, hundreds of thousands of households are left without power, Sona Holingerova Hendrychova, spokeswoman for the state-run power producer CEZ, said in a statement.  About 200,000 people were also grappling with power outages in western Poland.

In Germany, the storms caused flooding in Hamburg, where waters rose up around the citys fishmarket.

Avoid these common investing psychology traps
	
The Colombo Stock Exchange has recorded a growth of 6.5 percent so far during the year 2017. Initially the growth momentum was predominantly driven by foreign investors and at present local participation is increasing steadily. The local investor contribution to total market turnover has increased from 49 percent in April 2017 to 53 percent in October 2017.
There are some alarmingly standard mistakes that investors make again and again in the stock market. It is very easy in the heat of the moment or when subject to stress or temptation, to fall into one of these mind traps.
Inestopedia has highlighted some key psychological traps when investing in the stock market. This article has been compiled with the intention of educating the local investor community on psychology traps.

Anchoring trap
Firstly, what do we mean by anchoring Anchoring is the use of irrelevant information as a reference for evaluating or estimating some unknown value or information. In the context of investing, one consequence is that market participants with an anchoring bias will anchor their fair value estimate to the original price rather than to fundamentals. As a result, market participants assume greater risk by holding the investment in the hope the security will go back up to its purchase price.
Accordingly, the so-called anchoring trap refers to an over-reliance on what one originally thinks. For instance, if you think of a certain company as successful, you may be too confident that its stocks are a good bet. This preconception may be totally incorrect in the prevailing situation or at some point in the future.
In order to avoid this trap, you need to remain flexible in your thinking and open to new sources of information and the reality that any company can be here today and gone tomorrow. Any manager can disappear too, for that matter.

Sunk costs
What do you know about sunk cost A sunk cost is a cost that has already been incurred and thus cannot be recovered. A sunk cost differs from future costs that a business may face, such as decisions about inventory purchase costs or product pricing. Sunk costs (past costs) are excluded from future business decisions because the cost will be the same regardless of the outcome of a decision.
The sunk cost trap is just as dangerous. This is about psychologically (but not in reality) protecting your previous choices or decisions, which is often disastrous for your investments. It is truly hard to take a loss and/or accept that you made the wrong choices or allowed someone else to make them for you. But if your investment is no good, or sinking fast, the sooner you get out of it and into something more promising, the better.
Its far better not to cling to the sunk cost and to get into other asset classes that are moving up fast. Emotional commitment to bad investments just makes things worse.

Confirmation trap
Linked to the above is the confirmation trap. It can be difficult to encounter something or someone without having a preconceived opinion. This first impression can be hard to shake because people also tend to selectively filter and pay more attention to information that supports their opinions, while ignoring or rationalizing the rest. This type of selective thinking is often referred to as the
confirmation bias.
In investing, the confirmation bias suggests that an investor would be more likely to look for information that supports his or her original idea about an investment rather than seek out information that contradicts it. As a result, this bias can often result in faulty decision-making because one-sided information tends to skew an investors frame of reference, leaving them with an incomplete picture of the situation.
Consider, for example, an investor that hears about a hot stock from an unverified source and is intrigued by the potential returns. That investor might choose to research the stock in order to prove its touted potential is real.
People often seek out others, who have made and are still making, the same mistake. Make sure you get objective advice from fresh sources, rather than phoning up the person who gave you the bad advice in the first place. If you find yourself saying something like, our stocks have dropped by 30 percent, but its surely best just to hang onto them, isnt it - you are seeking confirmation from some other unfortunate in the same situation. You can comfort each other in the short run, but its just self-delusion.

Blindness
Situational blindness can exacerbate the situation. Even people who are not specifically seeking confirmation often just shut out the prevailing market realties in order to do nothing and postpone the evil day when the losses just have to be confronted. If you know deep down that there is a problem with your investments, such as a major scandal at the company or market warnings, but you read everything in the newspaper apart from the financial pages, you are probably suffering from this blinder effect.

Relativity trap
The relativity trap is also there waiting to lead you astray. Everyone has a different psychological make-up, combined with a unique set of circumstances extending to work, family, career prospects and likely inheritances. This means that although you need to be aware of what others are doing and saying, their situation and views are not necessarily relevant outside their own context. Be aware, but beware too! You must invest for yourself and only in your own context.

Superiority trap
For some people, the superiority trap is extremely dangerous. A lot of investors think they know better than the experts or market. Just being well educated and/or clever does not mean you dont need good independent advice and, even more so, it does not mean you can outwit the pros and a complex system of markets. Many investors have lost fortunes through being convinced that they were better than the rest. Furthermore, these people are easy prey for some of the other traps mentioned above.
There are (and have always been) professors of finance at the best universities who really are brilliant technically and this can delude them into thinking that the pickings are easy out there in the real world. Some really do cut it, but others are in for a rude awakening beyond the ivory tower. Odd as it may sound, someone with a Ph.D. in finance may in fact lead you in the wrong direction (too calculating, too confident), while someone with no more than a high school diploma may have an amazing feel for the market and make a fortune.

Bottom tine
Be aware of the nature of these traps and always be honest and realistic with yourself. Furthermore, seek advice from competent and knowledgeable people of integrity who will bring you back to reality before it istoo late.

Axed Catalan leader urges resistance to Madrid rule
	

Spain is on a knife edge as it grapples with the worst constitutional crisis in its contemporary history, triggered by an unlawful Catalan independence referendum on October 1 that was shunned by many and marred by police violence. 
Throwing down the gauntlet in the escalating standoff, Catalan lawmakers on Friday passed a motion, by 70 votes out of 135 in the regional parliament, to declare a Catalan republic. 
Opposition MPs refused to even vote on the issue and walked out in disgust. 
Catalonias secessionist leader Carles Puigdemont stood defiant Saturday against Madrids moves to depose him, urging democratic opposition to direct rule forced on the region to stop it splitting from Spain. In a televised statement, Puigdemont accused the central government of trampling on the will of independence-seeking Catalans who rejoiced at Fridays vote by regional lawmakers to declare a sovereign republic. 
Madrids decision to seize Catalan powers in response -- the first curtailment of regional autonomy since Francisco Francos brutal 1939-75 dictatorship -- constituted an aggression, he added. 
The separatist leader said democratic opposition was the only way forward, without specifying what form this could take.  Independence activists have called for peaceful resistance in the form of protests and strikes.

Fats Domino: Man who influenced Rock n Roll
	

If you come across a stack of old vinyl records of American music, there should be an EP or LP of Fats Domino in that lot.
Fats Domino (the nickname describes his girth) is no more. His death at age 89 was announced last week. If he is less well known here than Louis Armstrong within that small circle of people who listen to vintage American blues, R&B and rock n roll, thats entirely due to weaknesses in their musical taste.
Fats Domino was as much as a giant in the world of musical entertainment as any, and some credit him with the worlds first rock n roll record.
His 1949 single The Fat Man fits that bill more than many other claimants (though others might argue equally strongly for Chuck Berry). The Fat Man was based on a 1940 track called Junkers Blues originally recorded by Champion Jack Dupree.
Domino was a pianist, and his playing here is far more aggressive than what was normal for R & B at the time, and together with saxophone and guitar, the music is loud and feasty, and the lyrics referred to Junkers Blues references to cocaine and heroin while celebrating Dominos size and his success with the girls: I weigh two hundred pounds, all the girls love me, because I know my way around.
Altogether an unusual record, it sold a million copies. Until then, Domino had been just another pianist in a New Orleans band. The Fat Man turned him into a celebrity.

"Altogether an unusual record, it sold a million copies. Until then, Domino had been just another pianist in a New Orleans band. "
Elvis Presley called him the real king of rock n roll. He influenced many younger musicians  his Aint That a Shame was the first song the young John Lennon learned to play, and Paul McCartneys Madonna was deeply influenced by Domino. After the Beatles were formed, the band visited Domino to pay homage.
But Domino was really a Boogie-Woogie musician. Boogie Woogie became mainstream music in the U.S. in the 1920s, though its roots go further back. He learned the style from his brother, a jazz musician. The style is written all over Dominos debut album, Carry on Rockin With Fats Domino.
By then, Elvis had signed a contract with a major record label, and American music was undergoing seismic changes. Domino was no fool. He made the transition into rock n roll swiftly, and his debut album was quickly re-titled Rock and Rollin With Fats Domino. This was followed by two movie appearances and a run of classic singles with deep roots in the jazz and R&B of New Orleans, but with an overall rock n roll make up. They were good enough to make it to the US Hot 100, a difficult achievement back in the 1950s for a black artiste.
These singles include Im in Love Again and Blueberry Hill, a cover of a 40s Glenn Miller number which became Dominos signature song.
By the time the Beatles appeared, though, Domino was on the wane. By 1963, the record label which had signed him on tried to soften his sound. This had a disastrous effect on his career. By 1970, the sound toughened again, influenced by contemporary soul, and he came out with another fantastic Beatles cover, the White Albums Everybodys Got Something to Hide Except For Me and My Monkey. This revived his career somewhat. But, by the 80s, he declined to leave New Orleans at all, saying he couldnt manage without his favourite food.
Despite this fondness for New Orleans food, his life and career was lengthy and productive. His jovial face seemed ageless (and looks very Sri Lankan from some angles) and he was not temperamental like some of his contemporaries. When a riot broke out during a performance in North Carolina, he climbed out of a window and got away. Apart from rock n roll, had a deep influence on Jamaican Reggae, with his strong emphasis on the offbeat which became a hallmark of ska.

Former president  Obama is summoned for jury duty
	
US, (Daily Mail) 28 October 2017 -Former President Barack Obama has been called to serve jury duty in Chicago.
Cook County Chief Judge Tim Evans told county commissioners during a budget hearing on Friday that the former commander-in-chief, who owns homes in both Washington, DC, and Chicagos Kenwood neighborhood, will serve in November.
Evans told the Chicago Tribune that necessary precautions would be taken to accommodate security and scheduling needs. He did not specify the date or courthouse location Obama will report to next month.
Obama, who is registered to vote in Chicago, is not the first celebrity to serve jury duty in Cook County. In 2004, legendary talk show host Oprah Winfrey was called to serve for a Chicago murder trial.
Jurors can be summoned for civil or criminal trials and can be called to any of the countys Chicago or suburban courthouses.
Although its not a place where the public can earn a lot of money, it is highly appreciated, Evans said of Obamas choice to serve. Its crucial that our society get the benefit of that kind of commitment.
Jurors in Cook County are paid $17.20 for each day of service.

Pan Asia Bank 3Q profit flat over higher credit cost, slowdown in new loans
	
Pan Asia Banking Corporation PLC recorded modest performance during its third quarter as well as for the first 9 months amid challenging macro economic factors including higher interest rates, slowdown in demand for new loans and increase in provisions for possible bad loans.
The interim results released to the Colombo Stock Exchange showed for the quarter ended in September 30, the bank reporting earnings of Rs.301.3 million or 2.87 a share, largely unchanged from a year earlier.
Meanwhile for the 9 months the bank posted Rs.918.1 million in after-tax profit or Rs.2.91 a share in comparison to the Rs.905.8 million reported for the corresponding period in 2016.
The other income led by fees and commissions cushioning much of the earnings as the core banking performance moderated amid rising cost of funds and relatively slow demand for new loans.
The net interest income for the 9 months rose by 8.0 percent to Rs.3.67 billion from a year earlier as the rise in interest cost beat the rise in interest income. 
The net interest margin was tad weaker at 3.81 percent against 3.87 percent at the beginning of the year, albeit remaining above the industry average.
The bank gave Rs.4.8 billion in new loans and receivables during the period nudging the banks total loans and receivables book to surpass Rs.100 billion to end the period with a total book of Rs. 103.3 billion.
However, the provisions made for possible bad loans rose substantially during both the quarter as well as in the 9 months. During the 9 months the general provisions rose to Rs.390.1 million from Rs.261.9 million a year earlier while the specific provisions rose to Rs.178.7 million from Rs.18.6 million.
The growth in loans almost corresponded with the rise in deposits as the new deposits too rose by Rs.4.1 billion.
The banks total deposits which was at Rs.95.63 billion by the end of September is now flirting the Rs.100 billion mark, another key milestone for the bank which is within the reach of the bank before the end of the financial year.  
In March 2017, the bank raised Rs.2.1 billion fresh equity via a rights issue placing the banks capital adequacy requirements well above the minimum requirements under the new BASEL III rules.
As of September end, the banks both Common Equity Tier I (CET I) and the Tier I was 10.56 percent against the regulatory minimums of 5.75 percent and 7.25 percent respectively.
Meanwhile, the total capital adequacy ratio or the Tier II ratio was 13.1 percent whereas the minimum required is 11.25 percent.
Speaking on the performance, Pan Asia Bank Director/ Chief Executive Nimal Tillekeratne gave a more sanguine outlook for the bank albeit the recent modest performance, as the bank is currently reviewing its strategies and consolidating almost all areas of the bank, which is expected to yield stronger results.
I consider this year as well as the next asre-setyears, which will lay a stronger foundation for a sustainable and a durable growth in the medium to long-term, Tillekeratne said.
The bank is currently undergoing an overhaul in areas such as credit underwriting, risk management, operations, information technology, human resources and its network expansion strategy under Tillekeratnes fresh leadership.

## Title: Seylan Bank September net profit up 13%

Seylan Bank September net profit up 13%
	

A modest growth in loans and judicious portfolio management appear to have helped Seylan Bank PLC to post relatively better performance in the September (3Q17) quarter, the interim financial accounts filed with the Colombo Stock Exchange showed.
According to the interim results released last week, the mid-sized lender reported earnings of Rs.3.45 a share or Rs.1.22 billion, an increase of 13 percent over the same period last year.
Seylan Bank, which inherited sour asset base due to previous bad management nearly a decade ago, has been able to gradually recover from it and is currently competing neck and neck with the bigger players in the industry. 
The bank which was turned around from the brink of collapse in 2008 is a benchmark case study now taught in both local and international business schools.
The bank gradually has brought down its gross non-performing loan ratio to 4.67 percent by end of September from double digit levels a decade ago.
Although it remains about 177 basis points higher than the industry average, the NPL is comparatively better and Seylan is now on its second 5-year strategic plan, which will see the bank trimming down its bad loans further down to below 2.0 percent.
These results were impacted by provisions made on account of a legacy NPA, payment of which is due from the composition tribunal, the bank said in an earnings release.
The bank with an asset base of Rs.381 billion expanded its loan book by just under Rs.20 billion registering a growth of 8.2 percentlow on recent historical standards, yet healthier and a sustainable percentage given the present tighter monetary conditions.
The bank now has a total loan portfolio of Rs.261.9 billion.
Meanwhile, the deposits grew by a strong Rs.22.5 billion registering a similar growth percentage to that of loans and receivables.
However, the low cost deposits or the current and savings deposits as a percentage of total deposits fell to 30.6 percent from 32.5 percent at the beginning of the year, due to funds moving in to higher yielding fixed deposits. The banks deposit now stands at Rs.296 billion.
The net interest income the gap between the cost of deposits and other funding sources and the income from loans and other investmentswas up 19.22 percent to Rs. 4.14 billion for the quarter from a year earlier.
The bank was seen maintaining its net interest margin at 4.11 percent.
The bank in August announced Rs.10 billion subordinated debenture issue, convertible at a future date when the need arises to drum up equity to meet BASEL III capital requirements.
Meanwhile, for the 9 months ended September 30, 2017, the bank reported earnings of Rs.3.36 billion or Rs.9.58 a share, an increase of 19.39 percent compared to the corresponding period of the previous year.
As of September 30, the government held little over 32 percent stake in Seylan Bank through Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation, Employees Provident Fund and Bank of Ceylon.
Ishara Nanayakkara-controlled Brown & Company PLC and LOLC Investments Limited together held 22.59 percent stake in the bank.

Steering Committee Proposals: Will dilute foremost status of Buddhism: Amarapura Nikaya
	
The Sri Lanka Amarapura Maha Nikaya in a statement on the Constitutional Reforms Steering Committee proposals and the alternatives if implemented would downgrade the present status afforded to Buddhism and compromise the unitary character of Sri Lanka.
The statement has been signed by the Mahanayake of the Sri Lanka Amarapura Maha Nikaya, the Most Ven. Aggamahapandita Kotugoda Dhammavasa Mahanayaka Thera; the President of the Sri Lanka Amarapura Mahasangha Sabhava, the Ven. Dodampahala Chandasiri Mahanayaka Thera and the Acting Chief Lekhakadikari of the Sri Lanka Amarapura Mahasangha Sabhava the Ven. Dr. Pallekande Ratanasara Anunayaka Thera.
We see as even more dangerous the proposal, mainly targeting the two provinces of the North and East, the cutting down of the existing powers of the President and the Parliament and the proposal to amalgamate the Northern and Eastern Provinces. We wish to state without any qualms that providing limitless powers to the Northern Province is empowering the divisive forces operating in the country. Taking into note the extremist views expressed by certain politicians of the North, we firmly believe that limitless power in the hands of a minor political coterie will not be of long-term benefit to the Tamil population living there. It is very clear that their sole objective is to get a federal form of government that will facilitate secession later on. From statements made in the more recent past this could be a threat that will have serious repercussions to the entire country, the statement said.
Although the President and the Prime Minister have affirmed many a time that the proposed new constitution will not impair the well-being of the country and its people, we are of the opinion that the view expressed by members of the Maha Sangha and neutral academics that at this juncture, rather than having a new constitution, it is best to continue with the existing constitution with necessary amendments is fair and reasonable. We came to this conclusion because we observe that, on the one hand, academics in the political arena, who in the past have presented proposals that with time would lead to a division of our country on federal lines are actively engaged in the present exercise of constitutional reforms and, on the other, foreign powers and NGOs that for some time have been attempting to destabilise the country on the pretext of ensuring peace and reconciliation have shown much enthusiasm and eagerness to bulldoze a new constitution.
"Right at the outset, we wish to emphasize that the Sri Lanka Amarapura Maha Nikaya is making this statement with cordiality towards the government and the peoples of this country and our sincere aim is to establish an environment for all citizens of all races and faiths to live amicably anywhere in this country and in this regard to urge not only the members of the Maha Sangha but also religious leaders of other faiths and all citizens to join hands, giving up whatever political differences there are, to overpower any errant forces that are inimical to our country and its people.
"A federal form of government is not at all suitable for a small country like Sri Lanka. Moreover, such a form of government is an outcome of a need of states or regions that had separate existences to get together (federate) for greater political stability and economic advancement. Some examples are the United Kingdom, the United States of America, Switzerland, Australia and India. The outcome of the proposals placed on the table by the Constitutional Reforms Steering Committee is to artificially create a federal state of a country, i e. Sri Lanka, that had a unitary system of governance from the beginning (by articulating a myth of 'indivisibility'). By such an action it is inevitable that ethnic problems and issues of a kind so far not experienced in Sri Lanka will arise. Accordingly, under the present circumstances, bringing a new constitution will destroy the peace and harmony that currently exist among the Sinhala, Tamil, and Muslim people in general. Furthermore it will not only destabilise the country but also widely open the door for greater interference in the internal affairs of our country by foreign elements, the statement said

Tensions ahead of Australia camp closure on PNG
	

SYDNEY AFP Oct29, 2017 - Tensions were high on a Papua New Guinea island Sunday as authorities prepared to close an Australian refugee camp, with local police calling for calm as some detainees refused to move. 
The Manus Island detention centre, to close Tuesday, is one of two Pacific camps where asylum-seekers who try to enter Australia by boat are sent for processing under Canberras harsh immigration policy. 
Refugees had been given the option of moving to the other centre on the island of Nauru but most detainees have shunned the offer, expressing fears that relocation could further prolong their agony. Some have also refused to relocate on Manus, citing safety fears amid reports they would not be welcomed in local neighbourhoods. 
The guys (refugees) have said they will stay, they dont intend to move, Refugee Action Coalition spokesman Ian Rintoul told AFP Sunday.

## Title: The burial site of King Vijaya

The burial site of King Vijaya
	
The ancestry of Sinhalese people dates back to the landing of Prince Vijaya in the then Lanka. Prince Vijaya, is the first recorded King of Sri Lanka, who established the Thambapanni Kingdom in the name of the Sinhala people. He subsequently founded the Kingdom of Upatissa Nuwara and Anuradhapura.
As a country with a rich history dating back to his time, various archaeological sites bear testimony to the wars that have been fought in the name of the Sinhalese people. Although the whereabouts of Prince Vijaya are still uncertain, people strongly believe in myths of his burial site.
Last weeks news about an abandoned burial site in Hettipola, thought to be of Prince Vijaya, comes in this backdrop.
The burial site is located a few metres away from the Nikasala Aranyaya (Monastery) found along the Panduwasnuwara-Narammala Road.
According to our area correspondent, Pushpa Weerasekara, the burial site is situated at the centre of the Medagama Hill. It is believed that the structure of this site is similar to that of a pyramid or it looks as if two pagodas have been built, one on top of the other.
The pagoda at the upper level could be reached via a flight of stairs completed in rock. Yet, with the site being neglected and overgrown, it is difficult for one to climb to its summit. Certain bricks also have carvings of dates, believed to be at the time when the construction took place.
Another important feature of this site is that the monastery and the adjoining land comprise various medicinal plants used for various purposes.

"The monastery and the adjoining land comprise various medicinal plants used for various purposes."

The site is situated at the highest point of the Panduwasnuwara Kingdom, says Ven. Katuwane Ariyagnana Thera of the Medagama Monastery.
According to him, this site was Gazetted as an archaeological site during back in 2005. The Ven. Thera claims that it is extremely important to conserve this site as it is of the first King of Lanka.
It has been abandoned to the extent that nobody could reach this site because of the undergrowth. The people of this area are keen in the conservation of this site as it will be useful for the future generations. The Hettipola Police too has been informed about this negligence. Therefore on behalf of the people of Medagama, I humbly request the relevant authorities to start conserving this site and others that have been neglected.
The Daily Mirror also learned that conservation of archaeological sites is now done by the Central Cultural Fund. But several attempts to contact officials of the Fund and the Ministry of Internal Affairs, Wayamba Development and Cultural Affairs, failed.

According to our area correspondent, Pushpa Weerasekara, the burial site is situated at the centre of the Medagama Hill. It is believed that the structure of this site is similar to that of a pyramid or it looks as if two pagodas have been built, one on top of the other.

No archaeological evidence about this site:
A.M.N.B Alahakoon
In his comments to the Daily Mirror, A.M.N. B Alahakoon, Site Manager at the Panduwasnuwara Archaeology Department office said that although there was a myth about this so-called burial site, no archaeological evidence had been found thus far.
Therefore we cannot prove that this is the exact place where King Vijaya was buried. It is a popular myth in this area but without any evidence we cannot conserve it. The story of King Panduwasudeva never mentions of King Vijaya visiting this area.

Waqar, Amir Khan laud Sri Lanka
	
Former Pakistan head coach Waqar Younis has lauded Sri Lankan team's visit to Lahore to play the T20 international as a good sign for the return of international cricket to Pakistan, the Nation reported today.
Waqar said he was very happy to see that the Sri Lankan team was in Lahore and played a Twenty20 at the Gaddafi Stadium.
Their visit is very important for our cricket and hopefully it will now lead to more teams to come to Pakistan, he said.
Waqar said the PCB deserves credit for bringing back international cricket to Pakistan and also for convincing Sri Lanka to play one off Twenty20 in Lahore.
"What happened in 2009 was very bad for Pakistan cricket. It hurt our cricket and young players a lot. But now things seem to be moving in the right direction and today our people can show everyone that they are a peace-loving nation, who enjoy cricket.
The former captain said that the Sri Lankan government, Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) and players had shown that they were true friends of Pakistan.
"I know it must have not been easy for them after what happened eight years back with them. I can understand if some of their players have pulled out. But the important thing is Sri Lanka is here," he added.
Pakistan-born British boxer Amir Khan also came to Lahore to witness the third T20 match.
Talking to media outside the Gaddafi Stadium, Amir hailed Sri Lankan team for visiting Lahore and termed it a great decision taken by them which shows that Pakistan is a safe country and Pakistanis love cricket and want to see international cricketers playing in front of them.
I came here especially to support Pakistan team and I am glad to be here. I hope after Sri Lanka , more international teams will visit Pakistan and the country will start hosting full-fledged cricket soon, he added.
