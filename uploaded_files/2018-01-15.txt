Six persons arrested after fracas over scurrilous pamphlet
	
The Kobeigane Police said that four men and two women had been taken into custody after two parties who were ordered to come to the police station to sort out a domestic issue got into a fight as a result of a scurrilous pamphlet that had been pasted on the wall with regards to one of the women.
A mother of two had decided to get estranged from her businessman husband and had gone to her mother's place to stay.

She told them she suspected her husband?s family of trying to tarnish her good name by this act.
A Woman Police Constable (WPC) who had been present when the parties were called to the Kobeigane Police Station was injured in the scuffle that broke out and was admitted to the Kobeigane hospital. Police said that the woman who made the complaint, her father and brother had been taken into custody while the woman's husband, his brother and a another female relative of theirs were also arrested.

Song was played since Tamil leadership continues to deceive us
	
We aired the Tamil song ?Niththiraya Thamila Nee Nimirnthu Parada? as the Tamil leadership continued to deceive the Tamil people, Jaffna District Parliamentarian Angajan Ramanathan said.
The introduction of the SLFP candidate for Jaffna and the election manifesto was released on Friday. The event began followed by airing the Tamil song ?Niththiraya Thamila Nee Nimirnthu Parada? and certain songs composed by the LTTE.
Apparently, the matter became the topic in the Southern politics when Parliamentarian Namal Rajapaksa twittered whether Maithri had granted recognition to Tamil Eelam. Under these circumstances, news flashed across the social websites on Saturday, that President Maithripala Sirisena had reprimanded Parliamentarian Angajan Ramanathan.
However, when he was questioned about it, Parliamentarian Ramanathan said that he had too viewed the news on social websites and was amused as there was no truth, whatsoever, in it and such an incident did not take place at all.
"A Tamil renaissance song was aired and hence one need not view that with an ulterior motive. We belong to the SLFP and just because we support them, we need not shelve our sentiments as Tamils. When the Tamil leadership continued to deceive us we cannot close our eyes and maintain silence. That was the reason that we aired the song. Meanwhile, I will respond to Namal?s question at the appropriate time in the proper place," he said. (M. Roshanth)

## Title: Thai Pongal  Feast of the Sun for good harvest and prosperity
## Section: News Features

Thai Pongal  Feast of the Sun for good harvest and prosperity
	
Thai is the auspicious month of the Tamil calendar and Pongal is the dish of a concoction of rice, dhal of split pulse, juggery and milk. Thai Pongal is, therefore, the feast of the month of Thai. This is an occasion celebrated by Tamils all over the world on the first day of their calendar. This is one of the merriest and most popular festival of Tamils to announce the arrival of a plentiful harvest.
?
Thai Pongal is the feast of the Sun, the forerunner for a successful harvest, which in actual fact should be held after the Northern Solstice. The day after the Northern Solstice is December 23 but the Hindu astrologers have fixed the festive date to coincide with the first day of the first month of the Tamil calendar. This day normally falls between the 12th and 16th of the month of January in the Gregorian calendar. This year the festive day falls on January 14th.? ?
Rituals followed in this Thanksgiving family ceremony
Rituals of this family festival commence with the boiling of a pot of rice on the front doorstep of the house. All the members of the family gather around the pot of rice. All of them enjoy the occasion wishing one another with the delightful cry Pongal, Pongal Auchu! We are getting exactly what we expect. It is boiling, It is boiling
In actual fact, Thai Pongal is a Thanksgiving Ceremony. It is the Sun which brings prosperity in agriculture. Hence, the Sun deserves thanks and respect from the farmers. Animals including the cow, ox and buffalo help them immensely in the farm. Hence the farmers thank the sun, the nature spirit, forerunner of a plentiful harvest. They also thank the farm animals for their assistance in providing a successful harvest. While the farmers thank the Sun and the farm animals the rest of the population take this opportunity to thank the farmers for the production of food. Thus the farmers thank the Sun and the farm animals and express love and affection they rightfully deserve.? ?
Customs connected with Thai Pongal
There are customs connected with Thai Pongal which are means of expressing joy and happiness in anticipation of a new life for everyone blessed with plentiful harvests. The day of Thai Pongal begins at dawn. Every member of the family gets up in time for participating in this family festival. They bathe and dress and gather around the front doorstep or in the front garden (mutt ram), elders to cook the Pongal including rice, dhal, jaggery or chakra (brown sugar) or katkandu (sugar candy) and the other members of the family to assist in various ways. A flat square pitch is made and decorated gracefully with kolam (decorative patterns are drawn on the doorstep) and exposed to the direct sunlight. This is done as offerings to the Sun.? ?
The kolam is drawn using various powders made of various flours and other items made from grains. Since the preceding month, Markazhi (December-January) is topically rainy season, ants and other insects tend to swarm into the huts of farmers in search of food.? ?This kolam tradition serves two purposes. One to feed the ants and other insects at the same time keeping them at bay till Sun arrives.? ? A special fire-place is prepared using three bricks or three rubbles in the front of the house. Fire-wood supplied earlier is used to set fire at the auspicious moment. The cooking ceremony begins by placing a pot of water on the hearth.? ?
Prominence given to senior members of the family
A senior member of the family, mother, grandmother, father or the grandfather conducts the cooking. The other members of the family assist him or her. Those who cannot assist or participate in cooking watch the event with interest. When the water is boiled sufficiently they put rice into the pot. It is usual for a senior member to put three handfuls of rice into the pot. This is a ceremonial event. Those who can afford prepare special dishes adding other ingredients. The other ingredients of this special dish are chakkara (brown cane sugar/jaggery) katkandu (sugar candy), milk (cow?s milk), roasted green gram (payuru)), raisins, cashew nuts and some pods of cardamom.? ?
Family members, neighbours, relatives friends and well-wishers sharing the Pongal
When the meal is ready family members lay plantain (banana) leaves on the floor and they put the pudding on them. Before taking the meals they pray for some time and thank the Sun, the nature spirit, the farmers and the farm animals. After the prayers, the meal is served among family members with fruits such as Banana and Mango. Although Pongal is cooked in every house it is a usual custom to share the Pongal with relatives, friends and well-wishers. Presumably, this is done as a token of friendship, closeness and unity. Whatever it is, sharing each other?s Pongal is an important feature in the event. Some Hindu scholars believe that rice is ceremonially cooked on the Pongal day because of its importance as a potent symbol of auspiciousness and fertility.? ?
The morning hours are spent with the family members and close relatives including neighbours and in the evening they visit relatives and friends and attend to cultural events.? ? After Pongal at home, the family then moves to their family temple which is usually very close to their house for the Bhairava Pongal.? ?
Animals highly regarded and held in high esteem
Farmers give special regard to animals and hold them in high esteem. Hence the Thai Pongal Day is devoted to thanking the cattle. As a mark of gratitude, they bathe the cows which provided them with milk, oxen used to draw carts and buffaloes used to plough the land. After bathing the animals they paint their horns in various colours, red, blue, yellow and green. Their foreheads are smeared with turmeric and Kumkum.? ?
They are also garlanded. Poojas are offered on behalf of them and part of the Pongal is given to them. Thai Pongal is also an occasion for the family reunion and a chance to get together. Old animosities and rivalries are forgotten. Hostilities are healed and reconciliation effected. Thai Pongal is a feast of freedom, peace, unity and compassion crystallized in the last hymn on unity in the Indian spiritual text the Rig Veda. Thus love and peace are the central themes of Thai Pongal.? ?
Generally, the main purpose of this festival is to encourage social cohesiveness, the building of unity and harmony among the people and most importantly to recognize the services rendered by the farmer who provides food to the universe not forgetting the nature spirit, the Sun whose blessings are inevitable. Farm animals that provide immeasurable services in agriculture deserve our love and affection.? ?
?
"The kolam is drawn using various powders made of various flours and other items made from grains"
Thus the dawning of Thai is a preclude in fortune, happiness and prosperity not only for a particular group but also for the entire rice eating community. The first reaped harvest is offered to the Sun God by way of being grateful for the blessings in agriculture and in anticipation of better prospects in time to come.? ?
The Thai Pongal festival can also be called an occasion for conveying the relationship between life and the environment. Appreciation of the assistance provided by the natural spirits and expressing love and affection to farm animals for their valuable contribution in making food production efforts successful are noble qualities. Let us wish in the name of Humanity that we belonging to various social groups could develop mutual understanding and fraternity among the communities living in this country based on human love as are the objectives of Thai Pongal.

Wrong to revoke Jaliya's diplomatic immunity: Gammanpila
	
MP Udaya Gammanpila said today the diplomatic immunity of former Sri Lankan Ambassador to the US, Jaliya Wickramasuriya has been revoked for duties he had performed during his term of office and that this was the first such instance in diplomatic history.
He said the Foreign Affairs Ministry had, on October 27 last year, informed the Sri Lankan Embassy in the US that Mr. Wickramasuriya?s diplomatic immunity has been revoked despite a prior assurance given to him.
?The US government was requested to arrest Mr.Wickramasuriya on money laundering charges while he was undergoing medical treatment in that country. It is then that he had inquired from Foreign Affairs Minister Tilak Marapana on September 27 last year whether his immunity was revoked. On October 6, the Foreign Secretary replied saying his immunity was intact and that it has not been revoked. However, three weeks later, the ministry had informed our US mission that his immunity has been revoked,? the MP told a news briefing.
MP Gammanpila said diplomatic immunity was usually revoked in cases of murder and frauds but not in instances of carrying out diplomatic duties.
?Today, the government takes decisions bypassing the President. He only gets to know them through media. Perhaps he is not aware that Mr. Wickramasuriya's diplomatic immunity has been revoked. It is only the President could revoke the immunity. Therefore, he should pay attention in this regard,? he said.
On January 5 this year, a warrant was issued for the arrest of Mr. Wickramasuriya as he had failed to appear in court when a case against him was taken up for hearing.
Mr. Wickramasuriya was earlier arrested on charges of misappropriating funds allocated for the purchase of a building for the Sri Lankan Embassy in US. He was later released on bail. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Govt. seeking IMF advice to restructure CB: Harsha
	
The government has sought advice from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to restructure the Central Bank in keeping with the global best practices, Deputy Minister Harsha de Silva said yesterday.
With this in mind the government now has the option of either amending the Monetary Law Act or bring in an entirely new piece of legislation.
Dr. de Silva told Daily Mirror the government had held a discussion with the IMF in this regard.
The meeting took place in the backdrop of the Presidential Commission that investigated the controversial bond transaction, making several recommendations in relation to the Central Bank.
The Deputy Minister said the COPE investigation on the questionable bond issue had been sent to the Attorney General (AG) while the Presidential Commission of Inquiry (PCoI) appointed by President Maithripala Sirisena had also concluded their sittings and that too had been sent to the AG. Now it is up to him, he said.
He said the Central Bank Governor also overseen certain reforms within his purview, but beyond that the restructuring of the Central Bank was in the hands of the Parliament.
Revising the Monetary Law Act would enable the Central Bank to carry out its functions in the most appropriate manner. There is however a question with regards to the mandate of the Central Bank. The President is of the opinion that the Governor should be appointed by the Constitutional Council. Other areas that are a little grey is with regards to the autonomy of the Central Bank and its accountability,? he said. (Kelum Bandara)

928 kg of cocaine worth Rs. 16.7bn destroyed
	
Nearly 928.2 kilos of cocaine worth Rs.16.7 billion seized by the Police Narcotic Bureau in 2016, was prepared for destruction today in the presence of President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe at BOI premises in Katunayake.
It was carried out under the supervision of Colombo Chief Magistrate Lal Ranasinghe and the official of Government Analyst Department.
The stock of cocaine was liquefied in an aqueous medium at the INSEE Ecocycle facility in Katunayake to be transported for final disposal to the Puttalam Cement Plant by a container under police security. INSEE Ecocycle assures that the destruction process would not expose the people and the environment to harmful emissions.
Ministers Sagala Ratnayaka and Thalatha Athukorala, State Mministers Piyasena Gamage and Ranjan Ramanayaka, the Defence Secretary and Police Chief Pujith Jayasundara were present at this event.
This entire stock of cocaine was seized from a ship bound to India from Ecuador on December 9, 2016 and was the biggest stock of cocaine to be detected in a South Asian country. The cocaine was concealed in a container stacked with timber.
Minister Ratnayaka said some Rs.34 billion worth of narcotics had been seized during raids carried out between 2015 and 2017 and pointed out that it was about 50 per cent of the Sri Lanka Police Department's annual expenditure.
?The government is taking steps to put a stop to drug smuggling and for this purpose we have established a Special Division in the Police Department to curb organized crimes and drug smuggling under the directions of the President and the Prime Minister,? he said.
The minister said in addition to local anti-drug authorities, the government is working with international institution and agencies such as United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) in the US, Australian Federal Police and Interpol to obtain assistance and share intelligence on drugs smuggling.(Darshana Sanjeewa)

Namo Buddhaya!   ?Buddhism? How this book will help you
	
The book, ?Buddhism? translated and compiled by most Venerable Kiribathgoda Gnanananda Thera with much compassion, lays out the basics of what Buddhism really means. This book helps us understand the key features and principles of Buddhism and how it works, providing a useful guide to anyone who would like to follow the?noble path.??
Let us take the chapter on the four noble truths. The four noble truths are universal truths that were discovered and preached by the Supreme Buddha on the contemplation of the world: the truth of suffering, the origin of suffering, the end of suffering, and the path which leads to the end of suffering. These four factors are the core of Buddhism. Almost all sermons delivered by the Buddha are aimed at realising them. As a truth, it is something that never changes, regardless of?
external influences.
?Another central part of Buddhism is the principle of Kamma, which is clearly explained in the book. In short, Kamma is the result of whatever we think, do or speak intentionally. Whether it be good/bad actions that we make, Kamma, will always follow us ?as the cart always follows the bull that pulls it? and give results accordingly. Since Kamma is an outcome of our actions done intentionally, if we carry out unwholesome or bad deeds, we will only have bad Kamma. If we perform wholesome, good deeds, we will have good Kamma and also will lead to eradicate defilements, that is the ultimate happiness of Nibbana.? ?
?
"Let this book help you all understand and apply the qualities of Buddhism to your lives, and help in finding true liberation from this samsara. Let us all practise the Supreme Buddha?s teachings "
Here, in this book, are only the main and basic principles of Buddhism. The teaching as a whole delves far deeper into the mind than most of us can comprehend. However, understanding the anchors to Buddhism is the only way of developing one?s mind to realising the rest of it. We must train our minds to understand the unalterable truth of this world, for if we do not, we will forever be ensnared in this cycle of birth and death. Therefore, let this book help you all understand and apply the qualities of Buddhism to your lives, and help in finding true liberation from this samsara. Let us all practise the Supreme Buddha?s teachings diligently in order to acknowledge the four noble truths and attain?true happiness!? ?

Pakistan?s army chief told a top U.S. General the nation ?felt betrayed? by criticism that it was not doing enough to fight terrorism, the Pakistani military said on Friday, after U.S. President Donald Trump accused Pakistan of ?lies and deceit?.? ?
?U.S. Central Command chief General Joseph Votel told General Qamar Javed Bajwa during a telephone call this week that the United States was not contemplating any unilateral action inside Pakistan, the Pakistani army said in a statement.? ?
?Tension between the United States and Pakistan has grown over U.S. complaints that the Afghan Taliban and Haqqani network that target American troops in Afghanistan are allowed to take shelter on Pakistani soil.? ?Trump?s administration last week announced the suspension of about $2 billion in security aid to nuclear-armed Pakistan - officially a U.S. ally - over accusations Islamabad is playing a double game in Afghanistan.? ?
?Islamabad denies this and accuses the United States of disrespecting its vast sacrifices - casualties have numbered in the tens of thousands - in?
fighting terrorism.? ?
?Trump?s tweet infuriated Pakistani officials and caught the rest of the U.S. administration?

However, the U.S. military is also concerned that the Pakistani army, which effectively runs foreign policy, might close the air and land corridors on which U.S.-led troops and Afghan forces in landlocked Afghanistan depend for supplies. So far, Pakistan has not done so.? ?

Colombo district UNP MP S.M. Marikar today slammed President Maithripala Sirisena and even described him as a 'pickpocket President'.
Addressing a meeting in Colombo, he said the President had let down former president Mahinda Rajapaksa after partaking in a hopper meal with him. The MP charged that the same conspiratorial activity was being mooted to fix the UNP.
"The President accused us of being thieves. We call him the pickpocket President. We are asking him not to back-stab the UNP like what he did to Mahinda Rajapaksa," he said.
Mr Marikar was responding to a statement made by the President on the brawl that took place in Parliament on January 10.
?The President said the UNP and the joint opposition are calling each other ?thieves? but people are aware as to who the real thieves are. He called us pickpocket karayas. Yes we are pick pocket karayas but the President should not forget that we pick-pocketed him out of former president Mahinda Rajapaksa?s pocket. He should not forget that it was the UNP which made him the President. He is a pickpocket President,? Mr Marikar said. ?The president is planning to disassociate with us during the next national elections after becoming the president with our support,? Mr Marikar added.

PM developing country while President indulges in politics: Sujeewa
	
State Minister Sujeewa Senasinghe gave a reminder yesterday that it was the United National Party (UNP) that had brought President Maithripala Sirisena to power, but he was now seeking to stay President for six years without consulting the party.
Addressing meeting in Chilaw he said that while President Sirisena was busy doing this Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe was busy developing the country.
?That is the difference. Let?s do politics in 2020! What is important right now is the getting the country out of the mess it is in. The Prime Minister is going about this quietly but the President's priorities seem to be elsewhere. Whatever anyone might say, Ranil Wickremesinghe will be the President of this country by 2020. He will be the President until 2025. After that, he will entrust the country to the next generation of UNPers,? Mr. Senasinghe said.
He said LTTE leader Velupillai Prabhakaran started politically destroying the UNP until it fell flat on the ground literally. ?Prabhakaran, despite being a terrorist, had a sharp mind. He realized that the UNP would deliver development to the country when it was in power,? he said.
He said nobody would be able to prevent the rise of the UNP. ?Even if the President attacks us, we will emerge victorious,? he said. (Jude Samantha)

President doesn?t know what govt. is doing- Mahindananda
	
President Maithripala Sirisena?s utterance on cancelling the Gazette notifications issued on permission of selling liquor to females and the time extensions on liquor shops, MP Mahindananda Aluthgamage today said President Sirisena was unaware of what Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and the government was doing.
Addressing the media, he said it was astonishing as President Sirisena had not been consulted by both the Premier and the Finance Minister before the relevant Gazette notification was issued.
?It seems that the government headed by the PM is running the country without the recommendation of the Head of the State, President Maithripala Sirisena. Then, can we call this government as Good Governance? The government has been filled with chaos and disagreements right throughout its mandate since 2015,? Aluthgamage said.
Meanwhile, he proceeded to say that the only thing that the incumbent government had been good at is to sell public properties of the country to foreign countries and to the private sector. (Sheain Fernandopulle)

President resorting to publicity stunts: JVP
	
The Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) said today President Maithripala Sirisena was trying to gain publicity instead of ruling the country by criticising the decisions taken by some of the ministries at public meetings instead of in the Cabinet.
JVP General Secretary Tilvin Silva said the President had told a public meeting in Agalawatte that he was informed about the two Gazette notifications on permitting the sale of liquor to women and liquor shop opening times via the media and that he instructed the Prime Minister and the Finance Minister to cancel them.
He said the President should be aware of the decisions taken at ministry level and added that he should have resolved such issues in the Cabinet and not criticising them at public meetings.
?The President not behaving in the manner a President should. We wonder whether this is a ruse to gain publicity instead of ruling the country,? Mr. Silva said.
He told a news conference that President Sirisena had not been able to fulfil the promises made to the people during the past three years and added that he was only trying to safeguard the SLFP rather than working on fulfilling the mandate given to him.
Mr. Silva said the President came to power promising to abolish the executive presidency but now he was asking the Supreme Court if his term was five or six years.
?The President is not working according to the mandate he was given but attempting to secure power in the SLFP and protect the party. He must be having some ulterior motives in asking about his term during election time. He should have done this when the 20th Amendment was introduced or at the completion of his five-year term,? he said. (Ajith Siriwardana)
