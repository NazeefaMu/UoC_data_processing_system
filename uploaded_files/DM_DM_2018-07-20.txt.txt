A total Lunar Eclipse on July 27 - 28
	
Eclipses 2
A total Lunar eclipse will occur in the 1st quarter of Suvana constellation in the Zodiacal sign of Capricorn (Makara) when the Moon will pass through the centre of earths shadow beginning 22.45 hours (local time) on Friday July 27. The greatest eclipse will occur at 01.42 hours on July 28 Saturday and will end at 4.59 hours the same day. It will be visible in our country and most parts of Asia, Australia, Africa, Europe and South America.
The 2nd Lunar eclipse in the year 2018, this is the 21st centurys longest Lunar eclipse with the totality lasting for103 minutes.
According to the ancient Indian Rishis it is inauspicious to start any important event in life or embark on any plan or program for that matter on the day of a Solar or Lunar eclipse and during the three days both preceding and following the day of the eclipse counting a total of seven days. It is also the general opinion of the savants of Astrology that it is inauspicious to commence any important event or plan during the running of either the Zodiacal sign or the constellation in which the eclipse occurs either on the day of the eclipse or within the seven days preceding or the following the day of the eclipse which add up to 15 days

Are teachers a committed lot
	
Sri Lankas teacher trade unions through their strike actions have time and again negatively impacted the studies of children. Yesterday (Thursday) they were set to launch strike action against the questionable appointments of many teachers to the education sector. 
The appointment of unqualified individuals to the education sector must be checked and no parent nor Government official would contest such efforts. 
But what is of great concern is the overall decline in the commitment of teachers towards carrying out their duties in classrooms. It seems that most teachers are more inclined towards winning their rights rather than being positively engaged in this noble profession. 
There was a golden era in teaching when teachers went out of their way to educate their chargers. We have heard of teachers in the past conducting extra classes, often after the schools closed, with no benefit to them, but largely to ensure a bright future for their students. 
We get to hear of how some teachers are lethargic in popular schools in Colombo that children are left helpless. This leads to syllabuses not being covered in keeping with the work planned for a term. 
These under performing teachers must take the responsibility for the blooming of the tuition industry; which makes children lose the confidence they have in their school teachers. 
A close look at how these teachers perform reveals that they have mastered the respective subjects they teach, but know little or nothing about how to deal with children. As a result most teachers are arrogant, impatient and prefer teaching the bright ones. You dont need skills to teach bright students. What these teachers need to learn is how to make the not so bright ones interested in a subject. There are several courses conducted in Private Education Institutes which offer courses in coaching. The issue however is that these coaching sessions are expensive and dont allow the teachers to afford them, given the paltry salaries they earn. 
Another reason that contributes to teachers being grumpy is the meagre salaries they earn. Its a matter of concern that even a well-qualified school principal earns just a little more than a graduate teacher! 
But one must remember that teachers are in this profession by choice. No one forced them to enter the teaching trade. One of the most required qualifications a teacher must possess is that he or she must love being in the company of children and working with them. Most present-day teachers lack this quality. It seems that some of the underperforming teachers are in this profession because they couldnt find employment elsewhere. 
Parents also have constantly complained about the monies that are collected for development work at these schools. There have been occasions when these monies have been mishandled and there being a lack of transparency with regard to maintenance of accounts.
Just the other day the Daily Mirror reported how a leading school in Madampe came under the spotlight when Government money allocated to build new washrooms was misappropriated. 
Parents and their children on such occasions have chosen to stay tight-lipped in fear of having to face repercussions if they complain to the authorities. 
Another issue that parents face is the constant demand for money by children who come with pleas after they were asked to bring money for a school project. There have also been occasions where parents have had to find advertisements for souvenirs and sell bundles of tickets books, just to avoid their kids being embarrassed in front of demanding teachers. 
The school system has grown today and is highly politicized with as many as 17 teachers unions operating in the country. Most Governments in the past as a result have been willing to lend an ear to the protests of teachers. We are living during times when teachers prefer to channel their energies for trade union action rather than promote a caring and interesting atmosphere to learn at schools.

## Title: Coercing consensus on  MMDA reforms

Coercing consensus on  MMDA reforms
	

Statement issued by Muslim Personal Law Reforms Action Group


Muslim Personal Law Reforms Action Group (MPLRAG) is deeply disturbed and concerned over comments made by Minister of Justice & Prison Reforms Thalatha Atukorale regarding reforms of the Muslim Marriage and Divorce Act (MMDA) published on July 6th on the Jaffna Muslim website. Atukorale has commented that the Ministry is not able to take the reforms process forward because there is divided opinions among members of the 2009 Committee appointed to propose amendments to the MMDA. 
As evidenced by the Committee report, there are diverse opinions among Muslims in Sri Lanka owing to a broad spectrum of views on Islam and gender equality. This by no means should be an excuse for the State to delay or limit action in pushing for reforms. We believe that the State can and must weigh in at this time, particularly as it involves principles of equality and justice for its citizens.
Therefore it is of concern that the Minister, rather than assuming responsibility and proceeding with reforms by commencing the legislative process, is passing it back to the community that demonstrably holds different view points on matters of fundamental rights. 

Meddling by detractors must stop
The MMDA reform process dates back to the 1970s when the State of Sri Lanka appointed the first official Committee to propose reforms. For decades, committee after committee has submitted reports with recommendations to the State, which have not prompted any concrete action. The most recent report by the 2009 Committee was submitted by its Chairperson to the Minister of Justice in January 2018 - 9 years after this Committee was appointed. However, 7 months later there is still no official release by the Ministry of Justice & Prison Reforms. 
The absence of an official release and the commencement of the legislative process leave room for interference by detractors. This is because of those who are against some of the positive positions put forward through it. We believe that the continued non-publication of the report and not initiating a pubic debate towards legislative reform based on the recommendations may give rise to back door machinations aimed at coercing consensus. 


We take this opportunity to remind the minister and the Government of Sri Lanka that each day there is a delay potentially victimizes a Muslim woman or girl

We fear that this might make it possible to target the more progressive positions based on Islamic jurisprudence articulated in the report and bring undue pressure on those who have signed up to these positions. This would be disadvantageous for women and children. The fact that several of the recommendations are positive and that consensus has been reached within the Committee on a number of issues cannot be ignored. Lack of transparency will put in jeopardy this foundation and the hard work of the committee. 

Consensus is an unrealistic expectation
In calling for consensus on the remaining contested recommendations from Committee members, the minister is regrettably playing into the hands of those who want to scuttle the reform process. The stated positions on some of the recommendations that are the subject of dissent are contradictory and conflicting and cannot be resolved by pitting groups with divergent views against each other. The incompatibility is due to deeper reasons to do with the different approaches to Islamic jurisprudence, the inherent diversity among Muslim communities in Sri Lanka and (patriarchal) worldviews. 
One such issue is whether or not Muslim women can be appointed as Quazi (judges), marriage registrars and Board of Quazi members. Another is whether or not the MMDA should apply uniformly to all Sri Lankan Muslims regardless of which madhab (school of thought) they belong to. Pushing for consensus may in fact lead to compromises made under pressure, the consequences of which will adversely impact Muslim women and girls the most. 
It also must be noted that the positions, on which consensus have already been reached, must be further deliberated in the light of national laws and Constitution, as well as international human rights standards and Sri Lankas obligations. These recommendations should only form the first step in the process of amending the provisions in the MMDA and should necessarily involve consultations with Muslim womens groups and others as the process moves forward. 

State has ultimate responsibility
We take this opportunity to remind the minister and the Government of Sri Lanka that each day there is a delay potentially victimizes a Muslim woman or girl. Each day there is a delay has a cost. 
Can the cost of the last 7 months, the last 9 nine years, the last 48 years of no reform to the Muslim community be quantified or even justified How much longer do Muslim women and children have to wait before their rights are granted or see that equality is recognized and that grievances are redressed 

The fact that several of the recommendations are positive and that consensus has been reached within the Committee on a number of issues cannot be ignored

Despite the opinion of patriarchal Muslim scholars, like those who have given dissenting recommendations in the report, there is enough evidence in Islamic jurisprudence and legal tradition in favour of the most progressive reforms, as evidenced by the worldwide trends in reform of discriminatory Muslim family laws towards more egalitarian laws that guarantee equality and justice for Muslim women and men.
There is no rationale as to why Sri Lanka should continue to condone discriminatory laws or practices or make piecemeal and band aid reforms that will not resolve the most pressing injustices that Muslim women and girls face in Sri Lanka today, and in turn cause graver harm. 
Therefore the best way in which the final decisions can be made on all of the Committees recommendations, especially the ones the Committee is divided on, is taking into consideration Muslim womens lived realities and experiences and constitutional and international human rights standards, which the Government of Sri Lanka has the responsibility to uphold, regardless of diversity of opinions within Sri Lankan Muslim communities.
Minister of Justice please take note that MPLRAG on behalf of Muslim women and children demand the following: The immediate official release of the Committee report in English, followed by translated versions in Sinhala and Tamil as soon as they are available, the creation of space for public debate and consultations on all the recommendations of the Committee, especially with women who are most affected, that a definite process with timeline for enacting reforms in the Parliament be established and publicized by the Government without further delay.

Disciplining rowdy bus operators a pressing need
	
Some private bus operators simply dont respect commuters. Bus conductors dont conduct themselves because they dont know how to.
They dont carry ticketing machines, dont follow traffic rules, arent attired in their uniforms and forget to return the balance
money until asked.
They are not only rude to commuters but keep insulting them, especially ladies. To add insult to injury, they play blaring music that damages the eardrums of passengers. The National Transport Commission (NTC) and other relevant authorities should seriously consider displaying a list of rules on conduct and discipline in all private buses.

## Title: Govt. should invest more in  Early Childhood Education and Development

Govt. should invest more in  Early Childhood Education and Development
	
Investing in health, nutrition, education and protection from birth through to age five, also known as Early Childhood Development (ECD) enables children to reach their full brain capacity. This is the concept highlighted through the Eat, Play, Love campaign launched by the United Nations Childrens Fund (UNICEF). ECD is identified as one of the most effective and proven drivers of economic growth. In view of National Early Childhood Care Week 2018, UNICEF Sri Lanka organised a high-level meeting under the theme Building Brains, Building Futures. This meeting brought together leading experts in child development and also presented three early childhood-centric budget proposals to Mass Media and Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera to be included in the National Budget 2019. 

Sri Lanka needs to invest in its future workforce
- Jean Gough
In her remarks, UNICEF Regional Director for South Asia Jean Gough said that loving, playing with children and eating are the ingredients that the child needs in their early years of life. If a child is not loved, not provided with the right food and play is not simulated during these early years, the investments we do later on are totally lost. So this is the age to invest because the personality of a child is formed and its very simple. This is what early childhood means for us. As the South Asian Regional Director my job is to compare and contrast some countries in the region that have prepared to respond to the economic and social changes that they have gone through. Today is a combination of three years of activity that has taken place under the leadership of the government and investing in early years will be a key in driving Sri Lanka towards sustainable development. These activities started in November 2016 when the Minister of Child Affairs and the State Minister of Finance attended the Brilliant Brains Asia Pacific high-level meeting in Malaysia. Through this we started to focus more on the brain development of the child. During this meeting, leaders shared learning with counterparts across the wider region and focused on children on three areas; social protection, ending violence against children and providing universal healthcare. In March 2017, the members of the Parliamentary Caucus for Children and the Sectoral Oversight Committee for Women and Gender met their counterparts in South Asia again and upon their return they agreed to conduct the Parliamentary Forum on early childhood development later that year.
She further said that this meeting took place in November last year under the leadership of the Speaker Karu Jayasuriya and presented new compelling medical and economic research into the impact of ECD on economic and social development. Hence it showed how critical these investments are. Most recently, several cross-sectorial workshops led by the Department of National Planning of the Ministry of National Policies and Economic Affairs resulted in a budget proposal which will be presented to the Mass Media and Finance Minister during this high-level meeting. Sri Lanka is a trailblazer in terms of human capital investment in South Asian region. This position is because of the enlightened and consistent health and education policies implemented by the governments over a number of years. When comparing to other countries in South Asia, Sri Lanka has developed in these areas and needs to compare itself with the wider South Asian region. This is because as Sri Lanka becomes a knowledge-based economy, its growth will be driven by the innovation of its workforce who will produce knowledge-based products and services. The market for these products and services and trading partners will likely be the fast-growing economies in the Asia Pacific region including Singapore, Thailand, Malaysia and Vietnam. Unless Sri Lanka invests in its future workforce to enable innovation and increase productivity to meet the needs of the future, it will not be able to transform its economy. This will result in a struggle to compete with existing knowledge-based economies within the region. 

ECD has potential to improve school learning outcomes
-Mangala Samaraweera

Minister of Mass Media and Finance Mangala Samaraweera said that after studying these proposals they will be included in the Budget speech which will be presented in November. In fact as you know, a fundamental principal of this governments economic development policy is the economic empowerment of Sri Lankas citizens. We want to create an economy where citizens are able to take their economic destiny into their own hands, without relying on the state from the cradle to the grave. This entails the development of entrepreneurship and small development which is supported by our recently launched Enterprise Sri Lanka vision.
He said much more needs to be done to keep up with global education standards. One such important area of focus is the question of early childhood development. ECD is of great importance to Sri Lanka as it has potential to improve school learning outcomes which can have long-lasting effects on the well-being of the population. As Sri Lanka positions itself as a highly knowledge-based economy, robust, cognitive development from an early stage becomes essential. Preparing children from a young age ECD enhances their school readiness; children increase their retention rates and achieve better results in standardized tests, leading to a reduction in school dropout rates. 

One such important area of focus is the question of early childhood development. ECD is of great importance to Sri Lanka as it has potential to improve school learning outcomes which can have long-lasting effects on the well-being of the population

Studies across the world have shown that on average, children who participate in ECD programmes attain higher grades than their peers,the Minister continued. Additionally benefits of ECD go beyond economic growth as it can help fight income inequality and create better human beings. By levelling the playing field for children that come from diverse cultural and economic backgrounds, it takes the role of an equalizing mechanism across society. Investment in ECD also helps the government in providing a social endowment to future generations that help reduce income disparities in society. Given the huge benefits that improving learning outcomes can have on promoting human development and boosting economic growth, the government is committed to increase investments in enhancing quality of education.

Nutrition, health and experience crucial for brain development
- Prof. Melhuish
Speaking on the topic of Early Experience, Long-term Development and the Wealth of Nations, Professor of Human Development at the University of Oxford Edward Melhuish said across Organisation and Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries, 20% of people do not achieve basic minimum skills for adequate performance in normal societies. This problem is twice as great for disadvantaged groups. If we look at the jobs that the children born today will be doing when they are adults, 70% of those jobs dont exist. I dont know what those jobs but they will be highly skilled jobs. For example, thirty years ago, the job of a web designer didnt exist and this will be happening all the time. Therefore children of today, need to be highly skilled when they are adults so that they could adapt and adjust to changes in society. Therefore they require cognitive and non-cognitive skills and how these skills could be improved.
There are three strands of research that structure the importance of early years in developing these skills. Neuroscience shows the importance of early brain development, while Developmental Science shows that high quality Early Childhood Education  improves childrens life chances. Economics show that high quality ECE can save society significant amounts of money over time. Early childhood therefore contributes to creating the kinds of work forces needed in the 21st century. In terms of neuroscience, everything we do, feel or say reflects the functioning of our brains. By birth, there are 100 billion neurons and with brain development, synapses increase. Synapses are the junctions between neurons. They form at the rate of 700 per second in the early years. 60% of the nutrition a child receives in the first year of life goes towards brain development. By age three, 80% of synaptic connections are made and then there is this process of pruning synapses. This is not reinforced by experience and therefore you either use it or lose it. What we see is that synapse development influence brain plasticity which is the ability of the brain to adapt to experience and it declines with age. As such brain development depends on nutrition, health and experience.
In his presentation he also showed how synapses are formed in abundance by age two which eventually reduce in number by age six. Some highlights include how early childhood education is important for language development where language development begins at birth. Hence a child with poor language at three years will be at risk and it is important that the proper interventions take place. When looking at the rate of Return on Investments, this is usually high during pre-school years and gradually decreases during the post-school period. From the age of two, all children benefit from pre-school, the quality of which matters a lot. A high quality pre-school can protect a child from effects of a less effective school. As such when brain malleability decreases, government spending tends to drastically increase. He also showed how mothers education impacts literacy and numeracy rates of 16-year-olds. In his concluding remarks, Prof. Melhuish said that important aspects of quality ECE are stimulating interactions with children and effective curricula. In Sri Lanka, health services have improved for maternal care, growth monitoring, nutrition, immunisation and sanitation. However nutrition indicators have remained stagnant recently and there is still much stunted growth. ECE can boost child outcomes for the whole population and child protection needs improvement where children should have access to universal services. Sri Lanka faces a shortage of human resources and lags behind other middle income countries in terms of ECE since Sri Lanka spends an extraordinarily little amount on ECE. This is as low as 0.0001 per cent of the GDP lower than its South Asian neighbours and even lower than poor Sub-Saharan African countries. Consequently, ECE programmes in Sri Lanka are inadequate. Three observations are that accessibility is low, quality is low and governance is poor. But by enhancing access to ECE programmes especially for poor households, improving the quality of ECD programmes and improving sector coordination and governance, these targets could be achieved.

Groggy Govt. & its fallout
	

Good Governance the joke ofthis generation
	
	Glyphosate issue is more of a Sinhala Nationalist demand than an actual environmental and health issue
	
	Govt. contradicts and exhibits its inability to reach consensus in making decisions


Some smart guy who first stuck the label Good Governance on this unpalatable coalition perhaps guessed it could be the joke of this generation.
Or perhaps thought once the Rajapaksa regime was replaced by this motley group of politicians, anything was Good Governance.
Whatever way the Good Governance label came to be stuck on it, three years plus six months under it has only been horribly peaky.
It seems Ministers are there in this Government to decide and announce policy and implementation for President to reverse and cancel them thenext morning.
It also is a Government where the Cabinet of Ministers has to endorse whatever the President proposed at Cabinet meetings, but then could also contradict and oppose the Cabinet endorsement publicly, ignoring collective responsibility.
All that seems Good Governance for some Anti Rajapaksa Quacks who say that proves how democratic this Yahapalanaya is.
IF Yahapalanaya is all about messing up everything right royally, then whats the fallout with this type of a fractured and tattered Government

Will a Government as ineffective as this and eternally running into contradictions on almost every decision it makes whether collectively or as decided by the President, leave a future for this country

A few recent decisions of this Government seem to explain the hysterics of this Government.
Two months ago in early May, Finance Minister Samaraweera said fuel prices would henceforth be decided every two months on a pricing formula in relation to global market prices based on the Singapore oil price index.
He said it was being discussed with relevant Ministries. With that, local prices would increase when global market prices increase but come down when global market prices fall.
On that basis, fuel prices were increased on Thursday, July,5 midnight. Motorists refuelling early morning Friday, July 6 were perhaps charged on the new price, or they had to be charged on the new price as the fuel price increase was effective from midnight.
This Government policy was not an issue discussed at length in the media or among Colombo middle-class circles.
Within those circles, issues like 2020 Presidential Candidates, PTL cheques and Gotas US Citizenship are more important though they dont in anyway provide answers to serious problems the society is grappling with.
Yet how it could surprise and shock the President of the country, who chairs weekly Cabinet meetings, is more shocking than even the midnight price hike.
The result
A shocked President orders prices to be reversed immediately. With CPC authorities pressed to contact individual fuel stations to say prices should not be increased, the confusion left a schizophrenic society.
Those who may have been charged the increased price in the early hours of the morning to be told many hours later the prices have been reversed would have left an annoyed and a spitting consumer. This left the question what is Basic Governance In this paradise island, it means the President decides without any consultations with Cabinet ministers and on his own to reverse his own Governments policy without even explanations.
Leaving the adjective good aside, Governance with President reversing decisions as he pleases, is not about whether the decision (s) is just and fair by the people, but how decisions are made by a Government that promised accountability and transparency.- A government that was guaranteed by leaders of foreign-funded elite organisations in Colombo as definitely better than the previous Rajapaksa regime. The decision of the Finance Ministry to restructure fuel prices on an accepted pricing formula was in the public domain for two months.
If the President was concerned, he could have taken up the issue with the Finance Ministry or at a Cabinet meeting. But he proved, he wasnt concerned and therefore was not aware of such a proposal. Far worse is when the price increase is allowed once again after six days without any explanation by the President or his Media Secretariat.
It gets activated as any routine decision. And then, everyone else goes about business as usual.
The lifting of the Glyphosate ban is another mockery of the same type.
In Sri Lanka, the cry for banning Glyphosate was more of a Sinhala Nationalist demand than an actual environmental and health issue.
Scientists and academics of repute have consistently contested and challenged these demands made by Ven. Athuraliye Rathana Thera and another who denounces everything Western including medicinal science.
One who extols on primitive spiritual practices and rituals for healing and yet is accepted as an academic at the Rajarata Medical Faculty by the UGC and never opposed by the GMOA as well. That Glyphosate contributes to Chronic Kidney Disease of Uncertain Aetiology (CKDu) has never been clinically proved.
CKDu is prevalent in and heavily restricted to the Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa Districts, but is totally absent in districts like Ampara and in districts with large tea plantations and rubber estates.
The lobby for the Glyphosate ban was hyped on a supposed case study which is not accepted by any Medical Journal and was published by an environmental website and that too as a hypothesis
Thus their lobby could not convince even the avowed Sinhala nationalist leader President Rajapaksa to ban Glyphosate.
Despite all contradictions and controversies, President Sirisena in 2015 accepted the Sinhala nationalist demand and banned the total use of Glyphosate. There were many in the Cabinet who disagreed. Plantation Minister Navin Dissanayake kept arguing the ban would have a drastic impact on tea and rubber industries. A Pesticides Technical and Advisory Committee was appointed to advise the cabinet of ministers that handed over their report in March 2018. It was reported the expert committee had concluded Glyphosate cannot be held as the cause for the widespread presence of CKDu.
The ban on Glyphosate use in tea and rubber plantations was lifted in March for 36 months after discussions between the President and the PM, it was reported.
Meanwhile, Rathana Thera told media, the President had assured him personally the ban would remain for at least another year, before a decision was made and that Rathana Thera was working with the Presidential Secretariat to have a toxic and poison free country. Yet, in July a Gazette Extra Ordinary lifted the total ban on Glyphosate use in the country, based on the Pesticides Technical and Advisory Committee Report.If the President thought it necessary then in 2015 to ban it, there needs to be a good reason for him to agree to lift the ban 03 years later with CKDu still an unsolved issue.
President needs to tell the people, at least his own NCP voters, though he banned the use of Glyphosate in 2015, there seems to be no necessity to continue with the ban now based on the experts committee report.
Or that he has nothing to do with the lifting of the ban and the Gazette extraordinary No.2079/37 dated 11 July 2018 was signed by the Registrar of Pesticides. There is now Minister Senaratne publicly disagreeing with the lifting of the ban and arguing an official cannot overrule a cabinet decision. Another messThere is also a total contradiction in what this Government does and what it says about disappearances.
After over a years delay, the Office of Missing Persons (OMP) was finally established with the UNHRC Sessions coming up next September.
War affected people, who went before three other Commissions beginning with the LLRC from the time of Rajapaksa are invited again to place their grievances and complaints before the fourth public consultation now with the OMP. The question rightly asked by the protesting family members is, Why an OMP if the Government leaders including the President and PM say there are no disappearances
PM Wickramasinghe is on record telling Parliament on January 6, 2017in reply to a question raised by JVP leader Anura Dissanayake As per Police records, there is no information relating to persons who had allegedly disappeared during the ethnic conflict. However, they may have left the country illegally through unconventional channels, That brings this Government to the same page with Mahinda-Gota duo. Then why an OMP
The latest is the controversy on President Sirisenas announcement he would sign for capital punishment to prisoners who continued drug trafficking from their prison cells.
His decision announced at the cabinet meeting was endorsed unanimously, but ran into immediate opposition internationally, nationally and within the Government as well.
Discarding collective responsibility, Ministers Senaratne, Samaraweera, State and Deputy Ministers Ajith Perera and Karu Paranavithana have all opposed the death penalty.
The HRCSL and the BASL too stood firm against capital punishment. A few Buddhist monks contradicting Lord Buddha gave President their consent to implement the death penalty to eradicate drug abuse.

There is now a deafening silence on the death penalty. It would be another OMP that will not have any implementing despite the early hype...

Not surprisingly, Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith was one of the first religious leaders to endorse the Presidents decision, ignoring Pope Franciss statement that the death penalty is contrary to the Gospel, however, grave the crime committed.
There is now a deafening silence on the death penalty. It would be another OMP that could not have any implementing despite the early hype.
The whole of 2018 spent so far, this Government had contradicted itself and has exhibited its inability to reach a consensus in taking decisions and implementing them.
It had often been that anyway with even Budget proposals being shelved or amended after the parliament approved them. The pressing and important question, therefore, is, will a Government as ineffective as this and eternally running into contradictions on almost every decision it takes whether collectively or as decided by the President, leave a future for this country
A Government as groggy as this Government, will not be able to leave a future for the people of this country, not even that little bit the Rajapaksas could not gulp down whole.
And thats for sure.

HEALTH CAPSULES
	


CAN CELERY HELP LOWER MY BLOOD PRESSURE
Celery has traditionally been used in Asia to lower blood pressure. Asian doctors recommend 4 oz, or about 1 cup, of chopped celery per day. Expect results in 1-2 weeks. Celery contains 3-n-butylphthalide, a chemical that relaxes and dilates the muscles lining blood vessels.


CAN POMEGRANATE HELP LOWER MY BLOOD PRESSURE
For thousands of years, pomegranate has been known as the fruit of life. In one study, after only one month, 8 oz (250 ml) of pomegranate juice taken daily dropped systolic blood pressure in participants from an average of 174 to 162. After a year, the number had dropped to 152.


HOW MANY ALMONDS ARE IN A CARTON OF ALMOND MILK

How Ayurveda cures influenza
	


Many Ayurvedic community workshops are being conducted in the province in order to control the non - infectious condition of this disease. All this is done on the advice of the Department of Ayurveda in the Southern Province and the Provincial Health and Indigenous Medicine Minister Shan Wijayalal Silva

There are many pathogens that can be seen, heard of
and experienced by us due to
the weather conditions
that are prevailing.
Among them, the communicable disease called influenza which is a respiratory disease, has reared its ugly head. No doubt that creating awareness regarding this disease, its infectious conditions and the course of actions that can be taken for its prevention will lead to a sound , healthy and a trouble-free life.
These are some ideas expressed by the Southern Province Ayurvedic Commissioner C.L. Guruge regarding influenza. Recently, this disease began to spread rapidly in all divisional secretariats in the Southern Province. The Department of Ayurveda in the Southern Province has created awareness among the people about this disease, said Guruge. Steps have been taken to minimize the spread of the disease through various methods such as distributing printed leaflets, conducting workshops (Which is an initiative of the Ayurvedic community and clinics). When the first symptoms of the disease appear, advice is given to prevent its spread.
Steps have been taken to minimize the spread of the disease through divisional secretariat divisions, which are engaged in creating awareness among the pre-school children, teachers, pregnant mothers, adult groups and patients who suffer from special kinds of diseases and are vulnerable to contract this disease.
Many Ayurvedic community workshops are being conducted in the province in order to control the non-infectious condition of influenza. All this is done on the advice of the Department of Ayurveda in the Southern Province and the Provincial Health and Indigenous Medicine Minister, Shan Wijayalal Silva.
The Ayurveda Community Health Medical Officer in Balapitya, Physician Ishanka Malki helped create awareness about Influenza and the Ayurvedic treatments availbale for the disease.
There are many Ayurvedic medical treatments that had been used in the distant past regarding such communicable disease conditions. Ath beheth (temporary medicine) can be used for fever. Influenza that is spreading at present started with a viral infection. It may connect to bacterial infection as well later on. This disease will spread to others through the patients saliva particles and mucus, especially when the patient is coughing, sneezing and speaking loudly.
It has been mentioned in the ancient sources which are about 3,500 years old that various kinds of Jwara (fever) will be contracted when the microbes enter the body through five elements after its development under various conditions. These microbes alias invisible viruses will begin to develop due to various climatic and environmental factors. Therefore, influenza can be introduced as one such communicable disease which has emerged in that manner.
Get rid of unnecessary fear. By acting intelligently and with an understanding of this disease, it is not difficult to cure the patient, says Dr. Malki. When the disease develops in the human body, it weakens the patient. This is due to all body processes including Agni (food digestive system) and the conditions such as watha ( air) being affected due to the changing environmental conditions.
Resistance to Influenza should be developed in the human body in order to minimize the spreading of the disease. In this regard, both the physical and mental energies need to be developed. If you are a patient suffering from influenza, prevent yourself from staying in the places where people often gather.
Symptoms during the first stage of the disease:
<U+F03C>Fever
<U+F03C>Cough
<U+F03C>Pain in the throat
<U+F03C>Mucus coming out of the nose etc.,
Symptoms when the disease becomes acute:
<U+F03C>Difficulty in breathing and inhaling faster.
<U+F03C>Heaviness and ache in the chest.
<U+F03C>Continuous vomiting
<U+F03C>Dizziness
<U+F03C>Pain in the body

If these symptoms appear then the patient should go to a hospital immediately. The occurrences of these conditions are unavoidable due to the microbes including viruses.
Ayurveda Medicine has mainly taken steps to strengthen the body in order to overcome all these barriers. In order to develop this strength, it is essential to consume non-toxic foods, use local rice- which brings about immunity-eat fresh vegetables and fruits and green leaves as much as possible.
In addition:
<U+F03C>Drink boiled and warm water.
<U+F03C>Drink boiled coriander several times per day.
<U+F03C>Drink Venivelgeta water, Welmee and Paspanguwa( five kinds of herbal medicine)
<U+F03C>Drink coriander and Sirithekku after boiling in equal quantities.
With the use of these Sinhala Ath beheth (temporary medicine) the immunity to fight diseases will increase.
In the same way, a person who is in the early stage of contracting the disease can get the disease condition cured quickly without aggravating the situation. In addition, he or she should take proper medical treatment.
Inhaling the smoke of pawatta leaves along with the leaves of the lime tree, mixed with coriander will help reduce many discomforts.
Always follow the doctors prescription. In order to minimize the spread of this disease it is suitable to use face covers and change them every 4 hours.
If babies are immune to this disease, it is essential to feed them with mothers milk. If you are already infected with this disease and gradually recovering, it is better to take light diets.
The fever will subside if the patient is given types of rice like Heenati, Maduthuwalu and Batapolel.
Fruit juices and meats can be given gradually.
Also keep the following instructions in mind-
<U+F03C>Daily cleanliness is essential
<U+F03C>Adhere to good healthy habits.
<U+F03C>Avoid going to faraway places.
<U+F03C>Minimise sleeplessness.
<U+F03C>Get physical and mental rest


By following these instructions, the aggravation of the disease can be reduced, which will be followed by cure.

## Title: How to deal with Congenital Heart Disease

How to deal with Congenital Heart Disease
	
A congenital heart defect, also known as a congenital heart anomaly or congenital heart disease, is a problem in the structure of the heart, which is present at birth. There are many types of congenital heart diseases and the most common defects involve the walls and the valves of the heart as well as large blood vessels that carry blood to and from the heart. They range from simple conditions that dont cause symptoms to complex problems that cause severe, life-threatening symptoms and they fall mainly under these categories like: Holes in the heart, obstructed blood flow, abnormal blood vessels, Heart valve abnormalities and an underdeveloped heart.
Health Capsule got in touch with Dr Duminda Samarasinghe, Consultant Pediatric Cardiologist at Lady Ridgeway Hospital to shed light on the subject.
There are many types of congenital heart defects. Most of these defects occur due to abnormal formation of the heart during fetal development, thus resulting in anomalies in the heart. In most cases the cause is unknown, but there are various factors that may contribute to this condition.

If you have a parent or a sibling who has been diagnosed with a congenital heart disorder, then the risk increases upto 10%
If you take the general population into consideration, there is a 1% risk of being diagnosed with a congenital heart disease. If you have a parent or a sibling who has been diagnosed with a congenital heart disorder then the risk increases up to 10%. Although the reason defects occur is presumed to be genetic, only a few genes have been discovered that are linked with causing heart defects.
Six to eight in a thousand newborns are diagnosed with congenital heart disorders annually. Factors that determine the prognosis of a patient diagnosed with a congenital heart defect could vary as it depends on the severity of the condition he said.
The symptoms of a congenital heart defect may not appear until shortly after birth. Newborns with heart defects may experience symptoms like: having a pale, grey or blue skin colour, develop rapid breathing, have swelling in abdomen, legs or areas around the eyes, experience shortness of breath during feedings, and gain weight poorly.
Dr Samarasinghe further said, Although many children with congenital heart defects dont require treatment, the treatment depends on the type and severity of the defect. The most common defects identified are, ASD (Atrial Septal Defect), which occurs in the two upper chambers in the heart and VSD (Ventricular Septal Defect) which occurs in the two lower chambers in the heart.
There are two main types of treatment when it comes to congenital heart disorders. Catheter procedure is an interventional procedure which is a non-surgical treatment used to open narrowed coronary arteries to improve blood flow to the heart. An open heart surgery may be needed if catheter procedures arent enough to repair complex heart defects. Congenital heart diseases can be classified as either Cyanotic congenital heart disease, which causes low levels of oxygen in the blood, or Acyanotic congenital heart disease. In both types, the heart isnt pumping blood as efficiently as it should.
A cyanotic heart defect is a group type of congenital heart defect that occurs when the blood that has been pumped into the body contains a less-than-normal amount of oxygen. It causes a blue discolouration of the skin. The most common cyanotic heart defect is TOF (Tetralogy of Fallot) he said.
In some cases, symptoms of a congenital heart defect may not appear until many years after birth. Once symptoms do develop, they may include: Abnormal heart rhythms, tiring quickly upon exertion, swelling of body tissues or organs, a bluish tint to the skin, lips and fingernails, fainting and dizziness.
A congenital heart disease wont necessarily prevent a child from leading a normal life. The sooner they get medical attention, the better the chances for complete recovery. Regardless of the type of the defect, follow-up care is essential. Treatment may not completely cure the condition, but regular medical follow-ups and physical activity are extremely important when it comes to maintaining good health.

Lakmal wins Toss, hosts to Bat
	
Sri Laka have won the toss and elected to bat first in the 2nd Test match held at the Sinhalese Sports Club (SSC), Colombo.
After a disastrous first Test, the Proteas look to save the series in the 2nd Test against Sri Lanka at Colombo. The batting performance from the visitors left a lot to ask as they were bowled out for 126 and 73 in the two innings at Galle, with the Sri Lanka spinners doing all the damage. The hosts have a 1-0 lead in the series, and do not have anything to lose. Sri Lanka would be comfortable in pushing for a draw, and the onus to push for a win will be on South Africa skipper Faf du Plessis.
Teams:
Sri Lanka (Playing XI): Danushka Gunathilaka, Dimuth Karunaratne, Dhananjaya de Silva, Kusal Mendis, Angelo Mathews, Roshen Silva, Niroshan Dickwella (wk), Dilruwan Perera, Akila Dananjaya, Suranga Lakmal (c), Rangana Herath

Magistrate warns Officers to take care of suspects
	
Fort Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne yesterday sternly warned the Prison Authority Officers to provide necessary attention to the suspects, who were brought to be produced before the court, as there was a complaint that suspects Arjun Aloysius and Kasun Palisena had not received lunch or water till their case was taken up.
At the end of the Magisterial Inquiry into the bond issue, the Counsel who appeared for Arjun Aloysius and Kasun Palisena informed the Fort Magistrate that their clients had not received their mid-day meals or water for the entire day, while they were at the courthouse.
The Counsel said the suspects were brought into the Court House in the morning despite the case being taken up in the afternoon.
When questioned by the Magistrate, both suspects said they received breakfast at 6.00 a.m. and were brought to the court with other suspects in the morning and since then they did not receive lunch or water till the case was taken up at 1.40 p.m.
Fort Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne was seemingly unhappy about the incident and called all the suspects, who were inside the court cell at the time and inquired about it.
However, when a senior officer of the Prisons Department was questioned by the Magistrate, he said that meal packets were already given to other suspects. However, the meals for Arjun and Palisena arrived after the bond case had been taken up.
Therefore the other suspects were given the meals, except Aloysius and Palisena, he said.
Subsequently, Fort Magistrate observing the importance of providing the basic human needs even to a suspect, sternly warned the Prisons Department Officers to prevent such incidents happening again, as it was inappropriate and unacceptable and directed to provide the suspects with meals immediately.

MR violated countrys sovereignty by accepting bribe from China: Kabir
	
Minister of Highways Kabir Hashim yesterday charged that former President Mahinda Rajapaksa had not only accepted a bribe from China Harbour Engineering Company but violated the countrys sovereignty by getting into a framework agreement with the Chinese Company.
He said the former Sri Lankan government led by Mr. Rajapaksa had agreed to sell 50 hectares to China Harbour Engineering Company at the rate of just one dollar a hectare. He also charged that the framework agreement had clauses which denied Sri Lankan Navy the access to the Hambantota Port. This agreement would have been implemented had Mr. Rajapksa won the 2015 presidential election, Mr. Hashim said.
The Minister said Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe was able to change the agreement and see to it that Sri Lankan Navy had access to the Hambantota Port.
Joint Opposition MP Wimal Weerawansa who responded to this allegation accused Prime Minister Wickremesinghe is out to violate Sri Lankas sovereignty by making plans to handover Mattala International Airport to India. Mr Weerawansa said Sri Lankan government had agreed to construct a 40-acre defence line around the Mattala Airport. He also charged that government is planning to close down the Southern command of the Sri Lankan Navy in Galle.
The MP also challenged that New York Times story by saying that the US State Department had accepted that America had spent funds for regime changes in several Asian countries such as Myanmar. The New York Times Story revealed that China Harbour had given funds to Former President Rajapaksa for his election campaign.
Meanwhile, Chief Opposition Whip and JVP leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake also charged that former president had not only messed up the countrys economic strategies but also had harmed political independence and the sovereignty of the country by obtaining commissions from the Chinese company.
These development projects were connected with economic strategies. If the government had real economic strategies, it would have developed the Southern Jetty of the Colombo Port rather than constructing a loss-making harbour in Hambantota. Instead, we gave Colombo Jetty to China and built a port in a secluded area. There were hidden agendas behind such moves, he said. (Yohan Perera and Ajith Siriwardana)

He, therefore, questioned the Speaker as to when the English and Tamil translations of the commission report would be submitted to the House.
It is important that this House debate on the worst financial crime taken place in the country and we would like to know as to when the needed translations expected to be ready.

Power Upgrade: disruptions expects at times
	
The Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) would upgrade 132 kilovolt (kV) cable network system that feeds electricity to the entire Greater Colombo in a bid to reduce the wastage of power during transmission and distribution.
Ministry of Power and Renewable Energy Media Secretary Pathum Pasqual said the upgrade was essential and would be conducted on Friday (27) from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m.
The Ministry also announced that during the upgrade, power supply in the feeding areas would be disconnected.
Accordingly, power supply in areas, including Colombo 3,4,5,7 and 8 would be disconnected during the period.
Meanwhile, the ministry announced that from July 25 to July 31 power supply in the above mentioned areas would be disrupted at times.
Mr Pasqual said that the Ministry apologizes for the inconvenience caused to the public during the period but said the upgrade was to ensure better quality service and continues power supply to the public.
The nature of the network is such that all such utilities cater the needs of Colombo City almost exclusively.
The other specialty of the Colombo City is that the entirety of its medium-voltage distribution network as well as majority of the low-voltage network is underground. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

Read you fortune from yogas formed on your palm   Part XV11
	
Human hand  trailblazer of Human Civilization
We have already discussed a series of favourable yogas formed on the palm beginning with the Amala Yoga and concluding with the Wimala Yoga.
We propose to commence a new series of unfavourable yogas formed on the palm beginning this week.
By the way, our readers would find it interesting that practically for every yoga be it favourable or unfavourable that comes in Astrology, there is an identical or corresponding yoga in Palmistry as well, giving similar results.
We propose to begin this series with Daridra Yoga, a yoga that comes in Astrology as well.
Daridra Yoga: This yoga is considered present when all Mounts on the palm are flat or depressed with spots on the Mount of Moon and a sign of a star on the little finger.
Following formations are also considered as signifying the Daridra Yoga.
Fate and Sun lines are weakand broken
The Fate line is thick and it proceeds to the first phalanx of the finger of Saturn
The Mount of Venus is depressed and is marked by many obstructing lines
The Line of Sun is originating from the Mount of Venus
The Mount of Moon is depressed and there are two or more crosses on it.
Result: Person born with yoga would squander away all his wealth and is compelled to languish in poverty.
Kemadruma Yoga: This yoga is formed when the Mounts of Sun and Venus are depressed while the Sun line is broken.
Result: Person born with this combination is compelled to lead a life of misery and suffering. This bad combination would render ineffective all other good combinations if any, formed on the palm. The subject keeps on committing mistakes in life and goes on repenting over them. He remains poor and is compelled to depend on others forhis sustenance.
According to ancient palmists, a prominent and clear Fate line can nullify the effects of Kemadruma Yoga. There are also other formations that mitigate the ill-effects of Kemadruma Yoga. They are:
A Branch line from the Sun line proceeds to the Mount of Mercury
A line originating from a well-developed Mount of Moon proceeds to the Mount of Mercury
There are four full clear bracelets
Asuba yoga: A broken Sun line and a hardly discernible Mount of Sun produce this yoga.
Result: This yoga makes the subject lascivious and wrathful. He suffers from want. He is a cheat and believes in earning his livelihood by deceitful means. His life is a complete failure.
Papakartari Yoga: If the Mounts of Sun and Saturn are weak or depressed, the presence of this yoga is signified.
Result: Person having this yoga is a habitual sinner. He takes delight in cheating others and seeing them suffering. He is very wicked. He leads a life of misery and poverty.
Parashachatussagara Yoga: If the Sun, Mercury and Saturn Mounts are depressed and displaced, the presence of this yoga is signified.
Result: The subject always finds himself in reduced circumstances. He has no peace of mind and enjoys no comfort in life. All his efforts to do well in life end in failure, placing him inworse circumstances.
Napunsaka Yoga:A depressed Mount of Venus with a prominent spot on it signifies the presence of this yoga
Result: The subject is impotent and he would get no children
of his own.

We are inviting our readers to send in their issues and questions they have with regard to astrology and palmistry as we are ready to help them and educate them on this age-old scientific art. You can reach us on dailymirrorstars@gmail.com

## Title: Row over death Capital Punishment

Row over death Capital Punishment
	
Human Rights organizations and some foreign countries, including the EU, are not in favour
	
	The general public in the country seems to be endorsing it
	
	Is the President admitting his Governments failure in Prison Administration

How States resort to extra-judicial killings while keeping a moratorium on Death Penalty
Why the opposition to capital punishment by politicians is nothing but the best manifestationof hypocrisy


When Parliamentarian Hirunika Premachandra brought an adjournment motion in Parliament for the implementation of Capital Punishment in October 2015, the then Justice Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe had to give an assurance to the International Community that Sri Lanka would not implement the death sentence.
But now, the same Government has decided to do so.
Strangely, no political party in the country has officially protested against the decision. In a way, the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) might be happy about the decision as they would be able to use it against their opponents in future if they came to office.
If the incumbent Government started to implement the decision, one couldnt expect others, especially the SLPP, to reverse it once they assume power.
As in the case of introducing a new tax regime, the Government is helping the future Governments by taking a difficult decision to hang convicts.
Also, there are no signs of strong and clear opposition on the part of the religious leaders either, except for the Anglican Church of Ceylon, which had on Tuesday announced its disagreement and the Catholic Archbishop Malcolm Cardinal Ranjith, who had denied media reports, though belatedly, that he had supported the Governments decision. Interestingly, the Jathika Hela Urumaya (JHU), which claims to be following Buddhist Philosophy had brought a motion during the last Western Provincial Council meeting endorsing the implementation of the death penalty.
While Human Rights organizations here and abroad and in some foreign countries, including the European Union, are not in favour of Sri Lanka implementing the death penalty, the general public in the country seem to be endorsing it.
President Maithripala Sirisena, while announcing the Governments decision on the matter last week stated that capital punishment would be carried out only on those who continue drug trafficking, even after they were convicted and incarcerated for the offence.
But contradicting the Presidents statement, UNP Ministers said that the decision was made in respect of all drug-related convicts. In the light of the harm these drug peddlers and traffickers commit to our future generations in particular and society in general, and the obstinacy of those behind bars to change themselves, many tend to justify the Governments decision.
But the move raises many questions.
First of all the Presidents explanation is an admission of his Governments failure in Prison Administration. It is obvious that prisoners cannot access mobile phones or drugs or any other prohibited material without the support of Prison Officials. But it is common knowledge that they have all these facilities in Prisons. Despite increasing reports about prisoners using drugs, phones and weapons, bribing officials and misusing the Prison Hospital being carried in the media for years, no action is being taken to prevent those illegal acts. If the Government genuinely takes action to clean the Prison Administration and prevents illegal acts, such as mobilising drug business from within the prisons, there wouldnt be any necessity tohang anybody.
It goes without saying that the death sentence has never and nowhere totally deterred serious crimes such as rape and murder. Nor have the other punishments totally eliminated other crimes either. Many factors including education, culture, poverty and effectiveness of law enforcement mechanism contribute to the deterrence or proliferation of crimes.

The Jathika Hela Urumaya (JHU), which claims to be following Buddhist Philosophy had brought a motion during the last Western Provincial Council meeting endorsing the implementation of the death penalty.

Thus the effectiveness of capital punishment in the elimination of crimes is an obscure factor. Therefore, the suitability or unsuitability of it is also a matter that could be eternally argued.
Apart from the contention that the death sentence cannot serve as a means to make a man to repent since he would be no more to do so once the punishment is meted out, there is a danger of sending innocent persons to the gallows, due to the miscarriage of justice. So many unfortunate men had been exonerated decades after they were executed or incarcerated in other countries. Judges and prosecutors could later regret, but could not give the victims their lives or the youth incarcerated with them. Nor can they mete out justice to the original rape or murder victims of these cases.
Nevertheless, the opposition to the implementation of capital punishment by many politicians is nothing but the best manifestation of hypocrisy.
That could be corroborated by their behaviour during politically turbulent times in the country. During every regime after 1970, leaders of almost all political parties-ruling or Opposition- have resorted to extrajudicial killings or endorsed them, while the country maintained a moratorium on capital punishment. It was reported that as many as 20,000 youths were killed at the hands of the State Armed Forces during the first insurrection of the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) in 1971.
Many of them died on what was then called tyre pyres that were introduced in the country for the first time. That was the time people had seen human bodies floating in rivers for the first time as well. These bodies on tyre pyres and rivers were not of those killed in fighting or crossfire between the Armed forces and the Insurgents, rather, most of them had been killed after being captured.
Despite these murders being illegal, never a member of any of the then ruling parties- Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP), Lanka Sama Samaja Party (LSSP) and Communist Party of Sri Lanka (CPSL) had regretted them.
These killings were committed as a method of capital punishment for the victims alleged involvement in the insurgency or sometimes for the mere moral support for it.
President J.R. Jayewardene during his attempt to crush the Northeast Tamil rebellion set December 31, 1979, as a deadline for the then Security Forces Commander Jaffna T.I. Weeratunga to clear Jaffna of rebels, especially the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE). The Jaffna commander failed to meet the deadline but the people of Jaffna saw many human bodies floating in the Jaffna Lagoon. However, Jayewardenes successor Ranasinghe Premadasa decimated the southern rebels with an iron hand. It was during his tenure, the found mass graves were first introduced in the North as well as the South. The discovery of the mass grave of 31 school children at Sooritakanda in 1994 and the reports of massacres of hundreds of people in places such as Kokkattichcholai in the East were emblematic cases.
Despite the southern rebellion being still called JVP bheeshanaya, the number of extra-judicial killings in the South by the State Armed Forces and the vigilante groups - PRRA and the Green Tigers-was placed at more than 60,000 by the then Human Rights activists such as Mahinda Rajapaksa and Vasudeva Nanayakkara. We cannot recall any Human Rights activist or organization, here or abroad officially calling for a probe on the killing of Rohana Wijeweera, the founder leader of the JVP. There is no doubt that all these murders were a method of capital punishment carried out for expressing views or acting against the State machinery, while a relatively small number of death sentences delivered by courts were under a moratorium. During the Operations Riviresa and Sathjaya in 1995/1996 it was alleged that more than 600 people had been made to disappear apart from those killed in action. The allegations of extra-judicial killings and disappearances during President Mahinda Rajapaksas tenure finally landed the country in a UNHRC mess and the Paranagama Commission that probed the disappearances had recorded more than 19,000 cases in the north- east alone. On the other hand, the brutalities of the LTTE and the JVP too were second to none.This is the case with the so-called International Community as well. More than 9,000 Iraqi surrendered soldiers were buried alive during the first Gulf War in 1990/91. This was the concern for the human lives by those who protest against the capital punishment.

Thefact sheet presented by Labour andTrade Union Relations Minister Ravindra Samaraweerato the High-Level meetingexplainedhow a district-wide plan got children out of work and into schoolresulting in the worlds first Child Labour Free Zone (CLFZ) in Ratnapura.
The pioneering idea of a CLFZ was born when the Sri Lankan government started thinking about how to best implement its 2016 Roadmap on the Elimination of the Worst Forms of Child Labour. The Ratnapura District was chosen to pilot CLFZs because the structure of its economy was thought to increase the risk of child labour. Following an in-depth analysis of the root causes of child labour in the area, district government officials concluded that many of these are also at the root of other issues negatively affecting quality of life, such as malnutrition and unemployment, it said.
Taking a holistic approach, the district then developed a Total Child Development Plan (TCDP), which aims for all children in the area to be protected children. The TCDP combats existing child labour, prevents it from happening and improves life chances for all children.
Schools now proactively identify those children at risk of not completing their education and therefore at risk of child labour. Tailored solutions encourage school attendance and reduce vulnerability, Sri Lanka told the High-Level meeting. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

The 16-member SLFP group said today they had decided to join the Ekabadda Podu Jana Peramuna, a grand alliance which is to be formed under the leadership of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa.
This was revealed by MP Lakshman Yapa Abeywardena during a media briefing held yesterday at the parliamentary complex.
The 16-member group is happy about the decision to quit the government because it is all out to sell national assets. We will join the protest and rally that is being organised by the joint opposition on August 17, he said
On a different note, MP Abeywardena refuted allegations that there were divisions among the 16-member group.
Meanwhile, MP Dilan Perera said the 16-member group would convince the remaining 23 SLFP members, who were holding ministerial portfolios, to leave the government and join the opposition.

The Head Table (left to right)  Mr. Rizan Nazeer, the Chairman of the Local Promotions Committee  FACETS Sri Lanka, Mr. Peshala Jayaratne, the Chairman of the National Gem & Jewelry Authority, Mr. A. H. M. Imtizam, the Chairman of the Sri Lanka Gem & Jewelry Association, Mr. Mushtaq Jabir, the Chairman of FACETS Sri Lanka 2018, Ms. Indira Malwatta, the Chairperson of the Export Development Board of Sri Lanka and Mr. Sheriff Rahuman, the Hon. Secretary of the Sri Lanka Gem & Jewelry Association
On the 18th of July 2018 at a press conference held at the OZO in Colombo, the Sri Lanka Gem & Jewelry Association announced the launch of the 28th edition of the FACETS International Gem & Jewelry Exhibition.
The exhibition is to be held from the 30thof August to the 2ndof September at the BMICH. The inauguration ceremony on the 30thof August will be graced by His Excellency President Maithripala Sirisena as chief guest and Mr.Vladyslav Yavorskyy, a renowned gemologist and the author of three popular books  Terra Spinel: Terra Firma, Terra Garnet and Terra Connoisseur - will be present as guest of honor. Mr. Yavorskyys latest book Sri Lanka Gems, will be launched in the form of a coffee table book in Sri Lanka for the first time at the inaugural ceremony.
Following its inception in 1991, FACETS has grown in scale and popularity over the years to become the premier event of Sri Lankas Gem & Jewelry industry. The exhibitions purpose lies in the necessity to showcase the very best of Sri Lankas most precious resources, thereby boosting the sale of gemstones and jewelry among overseas markets and attracting more international dealers to the island. FACETS also serves as a means of levelling the playing field amidst the different segments of the local industry.
Ms. Indira Malwatta, the Chairperson of the Export Development Board addressing the gathering
Organized by the Sri Lanka Gem & Jewelry Association and sponsored by the National Gem & Jewelry Authority and the Export Development Board, the FACETS International Gem & Jewelry Exhibition will be held, as always, under the patronage of His Excellency the President and the Ministry of Mahaweli Development and Environment.
In 2016 the Premier Jewelry Pavilion and the Gem & Jewelry Mart were introduced and 2017 saw the launch of the FACETS mobile app. FACETS 2018 will see the collaboration of official partners in the organization of the exhibition. Amana Bank, Amana Takaful Life, Blue Ocean Apartments, Brinks and Securo Dynamics have taken on the roles of officialbanker, official insurer, apartment partner, clearing &freight forwarding partner and security surveillance partner respectively.
The FACETS International Gem & Jewelry Exhibition features something to suit every style and every budget. Ranging from precious stones, gold and silver jewelry and exquisite watches to semi-precious stones, colored stones and costume jewelry, the exhibition features an impressive lineup. Delegations from countries such as Nepal, Myanmar, Hong Kong, China, Russia and France, will feature at the exhibition, and many more individual buyers are expected to attend the event, thus increasing international exposure for the local industry.

The exhibition will also offer guests a glimpse into the lapidary sector of the Gem & Jewelry industry. A number of stalls will feature various pieces of machinery and tools used to cut and polish gemstones and craft jewelry. There will also be a number of laboratory stalls where visitors can get a look at the process of examination that a gem is subjected to. They can even test their own gems and receive a certificate proving the stones value and authenticity.
The previous years exhibition had the added presence of industry related academic institutes, which cater to the interests of young people seeking to join the industry. Special informational stalls will be set up this year as well to provide knowledge and details about opportunities to be found in the Gem & Jewelry industry of Sri Lanka.

## Title: The tragedy of the Yahapalanist young

The tragedy of the Yahapalanist young
	
Those between 18 and 25 years wanted change, a peaceful revolution and above everything else, a new leader
Most of those who defected from the SLFP to the Hansaya were also young, fresh faces that had made their fortunes in the UNP
Alongside promises made of change there were promises made of free wi-fi
There was, and always will be, a rift within the young between the english speaking crowd and those whose mindsets are manifestly of a different sort

Sri Lanka needed a revolution, we were told. This was way back in 2014, when the Uva Provincial Council Elections confirmed that the UNP, far from being the eternally defeated, could wield enough support among the grassroots for it to come back to power. That it did return as a majority owed more to Maithripala Sirisenas candidature than anything else, but for now lets forget that. Lets concentrate instead on a key element and demographic which voted this present government to power: the youth. Specifically, those between 18 and 25 years. They wanted change. They wanted a peaceful revolution. Above everything else, they wanted a new leader. One who would do away with old structures, call for reform, and basically end corruption. 
It was a new face they wanted and it was a new face they got. I distinctly remember the days following the January election when sections of this youth put up posts on Facebook and other social media outlets to the effect that finally, the old order of nepotism, corruption, and mafias was done, and that finally, a Maithri Yugayak would emerge. It was hard at times to figure out whether they were batting for Maithripala, the force behind the man, or that most youthful of the two mainstream parties, the UNP. Especially among those hailing from Colombo and its suburbs and surrounding areas like Wattala, Kandana, and Pannipitiya, the overwhelming belief was that Ranil Wickremesinghe stood for their interests. Much was made of the fact that the key drivers of the change in 2015 were fresh faces, politicians like Eran Wickramaratne and Harsha de Silva who had worked tirelessly to get the greens back in power. 
This was true even of those whose parents were traditionalists, who preferred the old order to a potential new and, until the last minute, hedged their bets on Mahinda Rajapaksa. One of the most glaring mistakes the Rajapaksa camp committed in its last few months was to ignore this demographic. True, the SLFP has more often than not been a petty bourgeois party which historically stood up for the interests of elderly Sinhala Buddhist conservative middle class tradesman and merchants (an observation Regi Siriwardena made decades ago), but with Mahinda Rajapaksa there came another reason for the youth to despise the blues: Namal Rajapaksa and his all but completely politicised youth outfit, the much derided, cast aside Nil Balakaya. When most of those who defected from the SLFP to the Hansaya were also young, fresh faces that had made their fortunes in the UNP (I am talking about Naveen Dissanayake and Vasantha Senanayake), the writing was, literally, on the wall. The young had wanted their opportunity for revenge. 
There was a classist element to all this. To be sure, the Mahinda Rajapaksa Cabal was seen as flirting with vested interests that made it more capitalist than the UNP. But consider that in the days immediately preceding and following the 2015 Election, it was rather difficult to separate the triumphalism surrounding Ranil Wickremesinghes return from the biases and the prejudices harboured by the privileged young against the village. While these biases did not come out in gushes and torrents, a facebook post there and a twitter comment here made it obvious that these for the most English educated or half-baked (gandabba) population equated the victory of the Greens to a victory of a new society that would privilege technocrats and meritocrats above everyone else. (For those who believe that all it takes to rid a country of such class biases is to bring those meritocrats to power, I highly recommend Michael Youngs The Rise of the Meritocracy.) What transpired in 2015, thus, was the substitution of a vibrant, overwhelmingly UNP-led culture of class differentiation (buttressed by a Kolombian mindset and by powerful school cliques) for a more conservative culture of class differentiation. Alongside promises made of change there were promises made of free wi-fi. This was not a coincidence. The then opposition knew what stimulated the young and they knew what it would take to turn the youth voter into a supporter. The man that they had to choose was probably the most unique presidential candidate in the history of this country. I need not delve into those infamous comments made over the Enrique Iglesias concert, comments which proved that this president was more fundamentally tied to the base of his party (which Regi Siriwardena pointed out) than his predecessor. The worst that Mahinda Rajapaksa let out regarding this demographic, after all, was his remark that the known devil was better than the unknown.

In the days immediately preceding and following the 2015 Election, it was rather difficult to separate the triumphalism surrounding Ranil Wickremesinghes return from the biases and the prejudices harboured by the privileged young against the village
Voters make errors. Thats a given, particularly in a democracy. I for one personally prefer such errors being made to an administration that is so complacent that it does not allow opponents to contend against it. In Sri Lanka especially, as even travel guides have pointed out, the political experience has been such that voters always turn out incumbents in the name of change, and this despite the most hardcore, unbearable, authoritarian administrations (the two UNP regimes in the eighties, for instance). In every era such errors are made concerning whos to succeed whom and which party should topple the incumbent. It is a fallacy to consider that the young have always been behind errors and decisions regarding change, but it is reasonable to surmise that, as with 2005 (when they wanted an end to the war), 2010 (when they wanted peace), and 2015 (when they felt that the end of the war was not the beginning of peace), they believed that a change in scenery was sufficient to effect the change they wanted. Given that political errors are made factoring in certain political dynamics, it is interesting to delve into what constituted errors made by this demographic in 2015. 
In 2015 change was, as I observed before, equated with the election of technocrats and intellectuals. Siding with Maithripala Sirisena on one hand were the new faces - Harsha, Eran, and Harin Fernando (all of whom have been either sidelined as deputies or pushed into relatively insignificant portfolios) - and on the other hand were the intellectuals - the artists, the academics, the talkers. Change was advertised in rosy words because the Hansaya consisted of people who were able to rationalise the badness of Mahindas regime and the goodness of Maithripalas regime in terms which appealed to the youth. When Thisuri Wanniarachchi wrote The Last King of Sri Lanka (Mahinda being the king), people didnt just read it, they read into it. Its easy to dismiss the scintillating, terse prose, the brash unravelling of political flaws it indulges in, and the stunning weight of its epiphany at the end as wishful thinking now, but for many of us then, it was anything but: we badly wanted the Rajapaksas to be toppled, and the young were at the forefront of that campaign. Writers like Thisuri provided the grist to their mill. 
However, lets not forget here that there was, and always will be, a rift within the young between the english speaking crowd and those whose mindsets are manifestly of a different sort. Such a distinction is hard to create or for that matter sustain, but it soon became apparent when the values associated with the former camp - feminism, gay rights, opposition to the death penalty - clashed with the values associated with the latter camp and when that clash took on a political dimension. When Thisuri wrote that tract lambasting popular schools in and around the metropolis and the culture of misogyny which (according to her) formed the crux of big matches and trucking, to give just one example, she received one blistering comment after another from those who had ironically earlier been united with her in their opposition to Mahinda, but who at the same time retained the same qualities which the likes of Thisuri associated, rather justifiably, with Mahinda Rajapaksa. Laying aside the point that most of her tirades against big matches and trucking were based on misplaced extrapolations (not to mention her animus against Sinhala Buddhist schools), it was a piece that deserved more, much more, than the childish, immature, and misogynistic remarks it attracted. 
As even this rift between the two faces of the youth indicates, there was a marked contradiction at the heart of the Maithripala campaign, and the young, believing that all it took for a change in the political scene was a change in the political scenery, believed that the values they stood for, with respect to the english speaking crowd, would be protected and preserved by the new administration. There is a wide gulf between the Thisuri Wanniarachchis and hardcore Royalists of this world, and this gulf, which was bridged and patched by the toppling from power of the Mahinda Rajapaksa regime, re-emerged when Maithripala Sirisena (inadvertently) brought back the old rhetoric of misogyny and authoritarianism. That was the biggest political error the young made this time: assuming that they were united as one, when in reality they were split into two. The two corners of this youth - the Kolombian and the non-Kolombian - naturally remain as alienated from each other as they always were. The non-Kolombian youth are fast being attracted to the Gotabaya Rajapaksa phenomenon. Thats where the rub lies. And with it, our tragedy.

## Title: Therapeutic exercises for scoliosis

Therapeutic exercises for scoliosis
	
There are a number of health problems that may cause the spine to curve more than normal or be misaligned. Scoliosis is a type of spinal deformity and should not be confused with poor posture. Spinal curvature from scoliosis may occur on the right or left side of the spine or on both sides in different sections. Treating scoliosis often means forcing the spine into alignment by taking invasive measures such as wearing a back brace or surgically inserting rods.
But what many patients dont know is that theres a third option; improving communication between the brain and muscles through scoliosis physical therapy. When treating scoliosis curves using a brace or undergoing surgery, theyre not actually addressing the source of the problem. While the root cause of idiopathic scoliosis is unknown, the disorders progression occurs because the brain doesnt respond properly to gravity, causing the spine to become incorrectly oriented. We spoke to Dr. Sujeejwa Weerasinghe, the National Organizer of the Chartered Society of Physiotherapists, to make a deep study of the subject for the benefit of our readers.
In a non-scoliotic body, the brain responds to gravity by telling the spine to straighten. In a scoliotic body, the brain incorrectly perceives gravity and fails to send the message. With the back muscles unable to maintain proper posture, the spine develops abnormally and scoliosis curves progress.
Definition
A normal spine, when viewed from behind, appears straight. However, a spine affected by scoliosis shows evidence of a lateral, or side-by-side curvature, with the spine looking like an S or C and a rotation of the back bones (vertebrae), giving the appearance that the person is leaning to one side. The Scoliosis Research Society defines scoliosis as a curvature of the spine measuring 10 degrees or greater.
Causes
While scoliosis can be caused by conditions such as cerebral palsy and muscular dystrophy, the cause of most scoliosis is unknown.
Most cases of scoliosis are mild, but some children develop spine deformities that become severe as they grow. Severe scoliosis can be disabling. An especially severe spinal curve can reduce the amount of space within the chest, making it difficult for the lungs to function properly. It appears to involve hereditary factors, because the disorder tends to run in families. Less common types of scoliosis may be caused for the following reasons:
<U+F03C>Neuromuscular conditions, such as cerebral palsy or muscular dystrophy
<U+F03C> Birth defects affecting the development of the bones of the spine
<U+F03C> Injuries to or infections of the spine
Risk factors
Risk factors for developing the most common type of scoliosis include:
<U+F03C> Age. Signs and symptoms typically begin during the growth spurt that occurs just prior to puberty.
<U+F03C>Sex. Although both boys and girls develop mild scoliosis at about the same rate, girls have a much higher risk of the curve worsening and require treatment.
<U+F03C>Family history. Scoliosis can run in families, but most children with scoliosis dont have a family history of the disease.
Complications
While most people with scoliosis have a mild form of the disorder, scoliosis may sometimes cause the following complications.
Lung and heart damage. In severe scoliosis, the rib cage may press against the lungs and heart, making it more difficult to breathe and harder for the heart to pump.
<U+F03C>Back problems- Adults who had scoliosis as children are more likely to have chronic back pain when compared with people belonging to the general population.
<U+F03C>Appearance-     As scoliosis worsens, it can cause more noticeable changes  including unlevelled shoulders, prominent ribs, uneven hips and a shift of the waist and trunk to the side. Individuals with scoliosis often become self-conscious about their appearance.
Children who have mild scoliosis are monitored closely, usually with X-rays, to see if the curve is worsening. In many cases, no treatment is necessary. Some children will need to wear a brace to stop the curve from worsening. Others may need surgery to keep the scoliosis from worsening and to straighten severe cases of scoliosis.
Symptoms
Your spine comprises small bones called vertebrae that are stacked on top of each other. It also has a natural curve that helps you bend and move. When you have scoliosis, your spine curves more than it should. It forms a C or S shape.
Usually the curve is mild and doesnt affect your appearance or health. Yet it can worsen over time. It can also cause back pain and other health problems.
Scoliosis can affect children or adults. Some kids are born with it. Most of the time, the cause is unknown. Adults can get it later in life.
Heres how to spot the symptoms of scoliosis in yourself or in your child. If you think you have it, see your doctor.
The following are the most common symptoms of scoliosis. However, each child may experience symptoms differently. Symptoms may include:
<U+F03C>Difference in shoulder height
<U+F03C>The head is not centred with the rest of the body
<U+F03C>Difference in hip height or position
<U+F03C>Difference in shoulder blade height or position
<U+F03C>When standing straight the presence of a a difference in the way the arms hang beside the body
<U+F03C>When bending forward the sides of the back appear different in height
Back pain, leg pain and changes in bowel and bladder habits are not commonly associated with idiopathic scoliosis. A child experiencing these types of symptoms requires immediate medical evaluation by a physician.
The symptoms of scoliosis may resemble other spinal conditions or deformities, or may be a result of an injury or infection. Always consult your childs physician for a diagnosis.
What increases the risk of scoliosis
In most cases, the cause of scoliosis is not known. The following may increase your childs risk of scoliosis:
<U+F03C> He was born with a birth defect that increases the risk of scoliosis.
<U+F03C> He has a family member with scoliosis, especially if both parents had scoliosis.
<U+F03C> He had a fracture (broken bone), radiation, or surgery involving the spine.
<U+F03C> He has a disease that causes problems in muscle control or activity. Examples are polio, cerebral palsy and muscular dystrophy syndrome and osteogenesis imperfecta (brittle bone disease) may also increase the risk.
Treatment
The goal with regard to treatment is to correct or control the curving of the spine and prevent further problems. Treatment may depend on when the condition started and the severity of your childs symptoms.
If the curve is mild or your child is almost fully grown, his healthcare provider may recommend regular visits to monitor the scoliosis. Your child may need any of the following:
<U+F03C> Cast or brace: This may help keep your childs spine from curving or stop the curving from getting worse. Most braces are small and light and may be worn under clothes. Sometimes a cast is used first and replaced with a brace after a few months. The brace may be adjusted as your child grows.
<U+F03C> Surgery: Your child may need surgery if the curve is severe and a brace has not helped. Healthcare providers may place rods, screws, or wires to help straighten the spine.
Risks
Treatments for scoliosis, such as a back brace, may be very uncomfortable for your child. Your child may bleed more than expected during surgery. He may also get an infection or have an injury to his spinal cord. If left untreated, the curve of his spine may worsen. This may decrease the space in your childs chest for his heart and lungs to work properly. His spinal cord and nerves may get pressed on and lead to problems or changes in organ function.
Therapeutic exercises
Correct therapeutic exercises can treat the underlying problem by retraining the brain to correct the bodys posture and help bring the spine back into alignment.
Types exercises
Physical therapy for scoliosis comes in many forms, with a variety of different approaches to treating the disorder. These can include:
<U+F03C>Focusing on breathing mechanics and function
<U+F03C>Using mirror-image exercises to balance out the curves
<U+F03C>Incorporating anti-scoliosis postures into normal daily activities
<U+F03C>Performing involuntary exercises to retrain the brain and muscles
While they all have different goals, most of these types of scoliosis exercises are voluntary, which means theyre performed intentionally. Involuntary exercises, on the other hand, occur when the body moves automatically in response to a specific stimulus; movements like carrying a bag or wearing a wrist watch become habitual within the brain.
Because posture control is an involuntary habit, the only scoliosis physical therapy that can effectively halt progression consists of involuntary exercises that help the patient form new postural habits.
Also known as Auto Response Training, involuntary scoliosis exercises involve placing small amounts of weight on the head, torso and pelvis. The patient then performs specific movements that help the brain perceive a different centre of balance within the body, which triggers the brain to re-balance the posture and realign the spine. These scoliosis exercises aim to:
<U+F03C> Stop or slow progression
<U+F03C> Reduce and stabilize existing curvature
<U+F03C>Improve function and cosmetic appearance
<U+F03C> Eliminate the need for invasive bracing or surgery
Auto Response Training works on every scoliosis patient, regardless of age or curve measurements  although its most effective for children with curves below 30 degrees. With early intervention and the use of involuntary scoliosis exercises, mild curves can often be reduced to less than 10 degrees. Larger curves will most likely never reach 30 degrees.

When is a heavy period too heavy  
	
Its difficult to define exactly what a heavy period is because it varies from woman to woman. Heavy for one woman may be normal for another. Some women, who feel they have heavy periods, actually have an average blood loss. Some women who feel they have normal periods actually have a heavy loss of blood. Most of the blood loss usually occurs during the first three days of this condition where the blood loss can be either normal or heavy.
We spoke to Dr. Kanishke Samaranayake, MBBS MD (OBS & GYN) MRCOG (UK) MSLCOG, Fellowship in Gyne laporoscopy( Akola) and Consultant Obstetrician & Gynaecologist DGH from Nawalapitiya to probe deep into this condition for the benefit of our readers.
Heavy menstrual bleeding is defined as losing 80ml or more during each period or the periods lasting for longer than 7 days, in some cases or both.
A period is probably heavy if it causes one or more of the following: Restricts your normal lifestyle because of heavy bleeding, you need double sanitary protection (tampons and towels), there is soaking of bedclothes, you pass large blood clots and if you perceive that you have to change sanitary protection too frequently.
Reasons for having heavy periods
Most of the time the cause is unknown for this condition. We call it dysfunctional bleeding and is probably something to do with the lack of the eggs maturing.
Others may be due to the following causes.
Causes connectedwith the womb
fibroids - These are non-cancerous (benign) growths in the muscle of the womb. They often cause no problems, but sometimes cause symptoms such as heavy periods.
Endometriosis  This is when the tissue that lines the womb (endometrium) is found outside the womb, such as in the ovaries and fallopian tubes (although this is more likely to cause painful periods)
Adenomyosis  When the tissue from the womb lining becomes embedded in the wall of the womb it can also cause painful periods.
Endometrial polyps - Small fleshy lumps within the inner lining of the womb can cause this condition.
Cancer of the lining of the womb (endometrial cancer)
Causes outside the womb
<U+F03C>Hormonal problems for which examples are an underactive thyroid gland and uncontrolled Diabetes. There is also a condition call polycystic ovarian syndrome.
<U+F03C>Infection in the lower abdomen (PID)
<U+F03C>The intrauterine contraceptive device (IUCD, or coil)
Visit to the doctor
He will start by asking you about your heavy bleeding, if there are any changes to your periods and any other symptoms you have, like bleeding between your periods or period pain.
A doctor may want to do an internal (vaginal) examination to examine your neck of the womb (cervix) and also to assess the size and shape of your womb. However, an examination is not always necessary, especially in younger women who do not have any symptoms to suggest anything other than dysfunctional uterine bleeding.
The tests to be ordered
<U+F03C>A blood test to check for anemia
<U+F03C>Specific blood test .i.e. Thyroid function test
<U+F03C>Internal swabs. This may be done if an infection is the suspected
<U+F03C>An ultrasound scan
A hysteroscopy  A narrow telescope with a light and camera at the end is passed into the womb through the vagina to examine the inside of the womb.
Treatment available
Watchful waiting - Seeing how things go with no active treatment. This is an option if your periods do not interfere too much with normal life. You may be reassured that there is no serious cause for your heavy periods and you may be able to live with them
Medicines without hormones  Such as tranexamic acid or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS)
Intrauterine system (IUS)  A hormonal device placed in the womb that lasts for five years.
Medication - Tablets taken before and during periods, the combined oral contraceptive pill, or progestogens either as tablets or as a 3 monthly injection.
Endometrial ablation  A procedure to remove the lining of the womb.
Myomectomy  Surgery to remove fibroids
Uterine artery embolization  A procedure to shrink fibroids
Hysterectomy Surgery to remove the womb is commonly done in Sri Lanka, but one should know that you can remove your womb through keyhole surgeries (Laparoscopy) without a huge scar on your lower belly.
Questions you have to ask yourself before choosing whats best for you
<U+F03C>Do I want to take tablets Will I remember to take them
<U+F03C>Do I need contraception at the same time
<U+F03C>Do I need a treatment that will help with period pain as well
<U+F03C>Do I need a long term or more short-term solution
<U+F03C>Do I have any medical problems that will influence my choice
<U+F03C>Will the treatment affect my fertility
  A wise decision is the key to success and always feel free to discuss matters with your doctor before deciding on whats best for you prior to making a commitment.
