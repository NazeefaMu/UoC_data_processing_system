Afghanistan and Ireland get Test status
	
Ireland and Afghanistan have both been awarded Test match status, the International Cricket Council announced today.
The move, which means the two countries become full members of the ICC, cricket's global governing body, expands the number of Test-playing nations from 10 to 12.
Both countries were confirmed as full members after a unanimous vote at an ICC Council meeting in London on Thursday.
It means their men's teams will now be eligible to play five-day Test cricket, widely regarded as the sport's pinnacle format, following a recommendation that their applications met newly approved member criteria.
It's been almost two decades since Bangladesh became the last country to be granted Test status.
But Afghanistan and Ireland have now joined an exclusive club that also includes founder members Australia and England, who played the first Test match at Melbourne in 1877, South Africa, New Zealand, the West Indies, India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe.

Attack on Uni. students: GMOA to launch a token strike today
	
The Executive Committee of the Government Medical Officers' Association (GMOA) last night decided to resort to a trade union action that will lead to a countrywide token strike to begin at 8.00am today, GMOA Assistant Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said.
Speaking to Daily Mirror Dr. Aluthge said the decision to launch an indefinite strike was taken for two reasons, firstly condemning the brutal attack on university students who protested at the Health Ministry building yesterday and secondly for not extending the tenure of Professor Carlo Fonseka as the Chairman of the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC), a decision taken by Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne.
Dr. Aluthge pointed out that according to the SLMC Ordinance a Chairman could be appointed for five years. Professor Fonseka?s five-year term expired in December last year. After a request by the SLMC Professor Fonseka?s tenure was extended by another six months by the Health Minister. That extension was to expire on June 30 and while his tenure could be extended by the minister for another six months thereafter, Minister Senaratne seems to be against this and was trying to appoint one of his favourites to the post, Dr. Aluthge said.
An emergency Executive Committee meeting will be held at 12 noon today at the GMOA Head Office to decide on further action.
He further said that doctors at hospital emergency units, Dengue control units and hospitals in the disaster affected areas would continue to treat patients as before. (Chaturanga Pradeep)

## Title: Banks to raise interest rates on Credit cards

Banks to raise interest rates on Credit cards
	
Sri Lanka?s banks have jumped to raise the interest rates on their credit card and several other loan products as the Central Bank last month gave them the green light to price their loans to reflect market interest rates.
Some banks have raised their interest rates as much as by 4.0 percent on products such as credit cards, which were hitherto capped at 24 percent, effectively raising the interest rate to 28 percent per annum.
The Central Bank last month lifted the interest rate caps hitherto placed on credit products such as redit cards, housing loans and a few others, allowing the banks to set their own interest rate caps to reflect the rising market interest rates.
Several banks have already communicated the change in interest to their customers. Certain fees levied on customers by the banks have also seen a staggering rise. The new rates will come into effect from July 1, 2017 onwards.
Some banks have also decided to raise the interest rates charged on temporary overdraft facilities, which were earlier capped at 24 percent.
Early this week, Fitch Ratings predicted higher interest rate pressure to hurt corporate performance during the next 12 months as most of the borrowings are short-term in nature and are on floating rates.
Meanwhile, higher penal rates are also on the cards as previous restrictions on such rates have too been removed. ?
The caps on penal interest rates were brought in 2013 in a bid to go soft on defaulters when the economy?s credit growth failed to pick up amid multiple attempts as the then authorities were of the belief that such a policy would stimulate demand for credit.
Although the Central Bank also has lifted the 16 percent cap on housing loans, the banks are yet to raise the housing loan rates.
Sri Lanka?s housing loans have been on the rise and account for the highest share under the industry?s construction sectorrelated loans. Higher rates could put pressure on the asset quality of the banks as the fixed income earners would struggle to service their housing loans.
Due to higher interest rates, taxes and inflation adversely affecting the disposable incomes of the people, Sri Lanka?s banks may see an upsurge in sour loans impacting their bottom lines. The growth has slowed down due to challenging operating conditions, which could also have a negative impact on internal capital generation as the ability to make higher profits is now limited.
In recent times, the banks have seen their margins thinning as the cost of funds has escalated because the banks have been fighting for a share of the deposits offering higher rates in an extremely competitive market place.

BRACE FOR DENGUE
	
There were 587 dengue patients per 100,000 in the Colombo District, Colombo Chief Medical Officer Dr. Ruwan Wijeymuni told the Daily Mirror yesterday.
Updating the media on the status of the epidemic in the city, Dr. Wijeymuni said that according to statistics, the Colombo City would have 421 dengue patients per 100,000 of the resident population. ?However, there had only been 2,740 patients reported from the city. Which is much less than is expected and is an indication that we have controlled the epidemic to some degree,? he said.
Reading out statistics, the CMO stated that there were 298 dengue patients per 100,000 of population across the country. However, with at least 45 percent of the patients being reported from Western Province, statistics showed there were 448 dengue patients per 100,000 in the Province. With at least 200 deaths reported due to the epidemic, 50 percent of which was reported from the Western Province, the three deaths reported from Colombo C i t y was a relief.
?
?
If we inspected one hundred houses, 10 to 12 percent of the houses would have potential breeding areas, this has to be brought down to 5 to 6 percent,
?
?We can?t say that we are happy about the situation but there aren?t many deaths reported from the city,? he said.
Health sources reported 61,000 dengue patients for the first six months of the year, while 51,000 patients were reported in 2016. The country was dealing with the highest number of dengue patients ever reported in its history, Dr. Wijeymuni said.
The number of potential dengue breeding grounds had to be reduced to ensure there is no outbreak. ?If we inspected one hundred houses, 10 to 12 percent of the houses would have potential breeding areas, this has to be brought down to 5 to 6 percent,? he said.
At least two percent of the residential areas, was also found to have dengue larvae, which again should be brought down to one percent. ?These numbers are much higher in some areas in Kalutara and Gampaha,? the CMO said. However, the solution to the dengue epidemic was not the reduction in breeding grounds and larvae but eradication of it.
Explaining the unique features of the epidemic, Dr. Wijeymuni stated that many of the patients reported this year were below the age of 18. ?When the epidemic first began it affected the children and then the elderly, but it seems the fever is affecting children once again,? he said. Fifty two percent of the patients reported with the fever were below the age of 18.
?The public seem to have forgotten the initial measures we took to ensure children would not be affected by the fever.
Measures, such as wearing long sleeved shirts and long pants and using mosquito repellents are some simple measures that can be taken,? he said. Speaking of measures taken to eradicate dengue breeding grounds, Dr. Wijeymuni stated that officials fumigated areas which had reported high number of dengue patients.
He said that houses had been inspected with warning given when potential dengue breeding grounds were found and legal action taken during extreme cases.
?Filing legal action is not our main aim, but we have been forced to do so in some cases,? the CMO said.
When compared to previous years the number of dengue patients had not reduced during February and March but had continued to increase.
?The peak period for dengue is June and July and November and December. This time we had to deal with an increasing number of patients from the beginning of the year and we can see signs of it increasing now as well,? he said. The CMO also stated that 86,639 residents had been inspected with 8,216 potential breeding grounds and 897 breeding grounds found.

All seven ports come?under Dengue radar
BY DARSHANA SANJEEWA
In accordance with the recommendation by President Maithripala Sirisena a dengue eradication programme had been implemented in all Government institutions, an official said. The dengue eradication programme is to be launched under the leadership of Minister of Ports and Shipping Mahinda Samarasinghe in all the seven ports connected to the Colombo Port, in the next few days. All possible steps have been taken to implement the programme and it would be implemented regularly in the future.
Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe initiated this programme at the Colombo Port recently. Deputy Minister of Ports and Shipping Nishantha Mutuhettigama, L.P. Jayampath, Secretary to the Ministry, Chairman of the Sri Lanka Ports Authority Dr. Parakrama Dissanayake, P.G.

Ceylinco Life ?Degree Saver? helps save for children?s higher education
	
A new life policy that helps parents save for the higher education of their children has been launched by Ceylinco Life, in recognition of the ever-escalating costs of overseas university education.
Combining the features of a life insurance policy and a savings scheme, the life insurance leader?s ?Degree Saver? is structured to create an education fund based on an agreed premium and policy term, while offering life cover for the duration.
The education fund will accumulate for the term of the policy with interest calculated at an accumulation rate which will be declared by the company on a monthly basis, ensuring that a fund adequate to meet the family?s higher education costs will be available when the policy matures.
The protection component of the ?Degree Saver? policy provides life insurance cover to the parents, offering them peace of mind with the knowledge that their child?s or children?s higher education will continue even if they lose their lives before the policy matures.
?This is an easy to understand policy that addresses one of the biggest concerns of parents today,? Ceylinco Life Director/Deputy CEO Thushara Ranasinghe said.
?An increasing number of students aspire to degrees from foreign universities each year and in many instances parents cannot afford the cost and often raise loans to pay for their children?s higher education. Because we offer policy terms of up to 30 years, they can start saving as early as they like with a Ceylinco Life ?Degree Saver? policy and also enjoy the protection of life insurance.?
The premiums for both the education fund and life cover are paid as one and the policyholders can choose the frequency at which to pay their premiums - monthly, quarterly, half-yearly or annually. The policyholders may choose any policy term between 10 and 30 years. They may also purchase additional benefits such as cover for critical illness, major surgery, hospitalisation and accidental death or disability, expanding the scope of the protection offered by the ?Degree Saver? policy.
A Ceylinco Life ?Degree Saver? policy may be purchased from any Ceylinco Life branch countrywide and also makes the policyholders eligible for the numerous benefits offered by the company as policyholder rewards, including the Ceylinco Life Family Savari programme and ?Pranama? scholarships for their children.
The market leader in Sri Lanka?s life insurance sector since 2004, Ceylinco Life has close to a million lives covered by active policies. The company is acknowledged as the benchmark for innovation in the local insurance industry for its work in product research and development, customer service, professional development and corporate social responsibility.

Court acquits two in Sri Lanka team attack case
	
An anti-terrorism court (ATC) on Wednesday acquitted two accused in the Sri Lanka cricket team attack case.
Obaidullah and Ibrahim Khalil had been accused of providing arms and training to the terrorists involved in the attack on a visiting Sri Lankan cricket team in Lahore on March 3, 2009.
Police last year said they killed three other militants involved in the 2009 attack. A US drone air strike earlier this year had killed another militant accused of involvement in the deadly attack.
The Counter-Terrorism Department had offered a bounty of Rs2 million for Qari Mohammad Yasin, saying he was involved in the attack, allegedly organised by militant group Lashkar-e-Jhangvi.
The Sri Lankan cricket team was travelling by bus when at least 10 gunmen fired at them with rifles, grenades and rockets, wounding six players and a British coach and killing eight Pakistanis.
Most international cricket tours to Pakistan were subsequently cancelled and the country was forced to play all its "home" games in the United Arab Emirates. (The Nation)

Cricketers to undergo high tension Physical Fitness programme
	
Sri Lanka Cricket yesterday (21) announced that it had established a high-profile evaluation and monitoring committee headed by Asanka Gurusinha to oversee the physical fitness & conditioning of the National Performance Squad ahead of their upcoming campaigns against Zimbabwe and India in Colombo.
Issuing a statement the SLC said that the move comes in the wake of Sri Lanka?s unfortunate exit in the quarter final stage of the Champions Trophy 2017, where they lost to eventual champions Pakistan in a nail-biting game on the 12th of June.
Elaborating on the plans set in motion, Team manager Asanka Gurusinha stated ?
?We know how much resource and effort was invested in the team ahead of the CT17, and we now how much effort each and every player made both on and off the field ? but we have the face the reality that we were just not good enough on the day, and look to the reasons behind this.
We have had several internal discussions with the coaches, trainers, the selectors, and the players themselves, and we all agree that there is a disparity in our fitness levels. We have incredibly talented cricketers, with the passion and the commitment to fly the flag on high ? but they are not quite cricketing athletes, which is where we need to be.
The National Selectors met on Friday (16) and have selected a provisional squad of 30 players ? these 30 players will undergo rigorous testing & evaluation this week, and will only make it into the squads for the Zimbabwe and India tours provided they meet the required grading,? Gurusinha said.
The initial testing of the 30 member provisional squad was conducted this morning under the supervision of SLC HP Training & Rehabilitation Manager Nirmalan Thanabalasingham who commented ?
?Sri Lanka Cricket High Performance Sports Medicine and Sports Science Department are running a battery of fitness tests encompassing body composition, speed, power and endurance.
We will provide this information to the selectors to help guide their decision making but more importantly give players a plan to improve areas of concern in a realistic time frame,? Mr. Thanabalasingham said.
The Committee which has formulated a strict evaluation criteria is comprised of Chairman National Selection Committee Sanath Jayasuriya, Team Manager Asanka Gurusinha, Chairman SLC Medical Panel Professor Arjuna de Silva, High Performance Manager Simon Willis, Rehabilitation Manager Nirmalan Thanabalasingham and National Trainer Nicholas Lee.

## Title: Dengue Dengue Everywhere

Dengue Dengue Everywhere
	
With over a whopping 67, 205 cases and some 200 deaths being reported countrywide, the Dengue menace has reached new heights. With June being the peak month to inflict the malady on innocent lives, efforts to eradicate the disease has intensified further. As the number of patients being hospitalised is on the rise, the Health Ministry and relevant authorities remain perplexed on how best to address the growing epidemic which has topped the list as one of the major national crises. ??
According to a recent statement by Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne, the ministry is currently studying the possibility of importing ?Wolbachia? -- a newly-developed bacterium for Dengue control -- from Australia. It is believed that the bacterium combats the virus from replicating inside the mosquitoes, and that by getting Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes to mate and pass the bacterium to future generations, the cases of Dengue will diminish. Thus, given the fact that this plan works out, it could be surmised that mosquitoes carrying Wolbachia would fail to transmit the Dengue. ??
Speaking to the?Daily Mirror, several officials from the health sector explained the gravity of the situation whilst shedding light upon the baffling question: ?why has the number of Dengue cases increased steeply in Sri Lanka during the recent past?? While underscoring the need for constructive engagement to battle this menace, they stressed the need to raise more awareness among the general public on this concern. ??
?
?
With Dengue patients spiking up in the monsoon season, more and more lives are being threatened every day. This increase is inevitable. Hospitals are flooding with Dengue patients, and what lies ahead is the challenge of reducing the number of deaths caused from this disease. ??
?The number of Dengue patients being hospitalised keeps increasing on a daily basis. Despite limited facilities, relevant authorities travel that extra mile to nurse and recuperate these patients. With the onset of the monsoon season, the number of Dengue patients augmented as anticipated. Our main aim right now is to reduce the number of deaths caused by Dengue.? ??
Against this backdrop props the question about Dextran 40, a drug used to treat Dengue patients, which might be running out of stock. ??
Dr. Hasitha assured that there were sufficient stocks at the moment, and that steps were being taken to ensure that there would be no shortage in future whatsoever. ??
?Currently, the drugs for Dengue are not in short supply. But we have made plans to ensure that necessary drugs will be available in future. We have to depend on the international supplier,? Dr. Hasitha said. ??
?
Despite limited facilities, relevant authorities travel that extra mile to nurse and recuperate these patients
?
However, with Dengue posing a serious threat to the lives of the people, the public is strictly advised to identify and eliminate Dengue breeding grounds in their surroundings. Dr. Hasitha advises patients to get a full blood count on the first sign of fever. ??
?
Drugs for Dengue are not in short supply. But we have made plans to ensure that necessary drugs will be available in future?
?
?Seek medical attention on the contraction of fever as early as possible with a full blood count on time is of essence. Never resort to self-medication. Generally, painkillers and unprescribed drugs are not treatment for fever and should be avoided at any cost. On such occasions, patients could face serious hygienic complications including bleeding. Even on receiving medication, a patient should be aware if he or she has been prescribed painkillers and should avoid taking such drugs. It is just as important for the general public to stay vigilant and destroy mosquito breeding grounds. This should not be an isolated effort. Each and every individual in the country has to take the responsibility and act to control the Dengue menace.? ??
?
Hospital facilities available for patients are on verging limits with Dengue raising its ugly head in the most abrupt way this year. According to Professor Arjuna, despite concerns over a dearth of accommodation, Dengue patients are being treated as usual. ??
?
Dengue has risen like we have never seen before. The ?Type 2? Dengue virus is to also take the blame for this drastic rise
?
?Facilities at the Ragama Hospital are limited with respect to the number of Dengue patients. Although it is difficult, we are managing our patients. It is a struggle. Extended hospital facilities are the need of the hour. We do not require ventilators or more ICUs. What we need in particular are more high dependency units (HDUs). Currently, we have shifted some of the patients to the ICUs due to lack of space, even though they do not require intensive care. This occupies more space at ICUs which are required by patients in a more critical condition. More staff is also a must. Nurses should be extended to treat patients more effectively and efficiently. This will help us reduce the number of deaths caused by Dengue,? Prof. De Silva said. ??
The rise in the number of Dengue patients with the monsoon season has brought more devastating results than expected. Unknown modes of Dengue breeding have been uncovered by research. It has been surmised that Aedes aegypti, mosquitoes that transmit Dengue, possess the ability to breed in salty and dirty water. This causes a general perception that Dengue can only breed in clear, clean water to stand corrected also extending the range of potential mosquito breeding sites to which our attention has to be directed to. ??
?This year, Dengue has risen like we have never seen before. The ?Type 2? Dengue virus is to also take the blame for this drastic rise. Researches prove that Dengue mosquitoes can also breed in salty and impure water. Hence, controlling the severity of the Dengue situation in the country corresponds to managing a war at the moment. The conditions have worsened, particularly with the recent rains.? ??
?
Garbage situation in the country is definitely linked to the Dengue matter causing negative effects on the issue. We should approach an all-out ban on plastic that should include polythene bags in the least
?
Professor Arjuna pointed out that the development of a Dengue vaccine was underway. ??
?It will be awhile before the Dengue vaccine will be administered in the treatment of patients as it is still being developed and has not been tested out yet. But once done, the situation in the country will improve drastically. Other prevalent issues do not seem to help resolve this menace any further. For instance, can the garbage dilemma in the country aggravate the Dengue victim count this year? ??
?The garbage situation in the country is definitely linked to the Dengue matter causing negative effects on the issue. We should approach an all-out ban on plastic that should include polythene bags in the least. Efforts to control Dengue should continue as Dengue shows signs of remaining for a long time. The government should look into these concerns and take apt measures forthwith. But they alone cannot accomplish this. We have to assist as well.? ??
?
?
Refuting the allegations that the hospital has provided drugs other than Paracetamol to patients, Consultant Physician of the Infectious Diseases Hospital (IDH) Dr. Ananda Wijewickrama clarified that some private hospitals have engaged in such medical practice and that Infectious Diseases Hospital was not responsible for any such medical malpractice. ??
?Currently, an inquiry is being conducted by the ministry with regard to this matter. Government hospitals don?t administer any other drug except Paracetamol to its Dengue patients. Sometimes, patients tend to take drugs such as Diclofenac Sodium instead of Paracetamol either on their own accord or upon the directions of a private medical practitioner. Such things could lead into health complications in a Dengue patient,? he said. ??
?

?
Commenting on the number of Dengue patients being admitted into the hospital, Dr. Wijewickrama said despite there were no deaths reported, the number of Dengue patients being reported at IDH had increased significantly. ?He said all hospitals in Colombo were filled beyond their capacities with Dengue patients. ??
?
Dengue widespread has raised severe concerns throughout the island, and the World Health Organisation (WHO) share their thoughts on the outbreak. Dr. Sugandhika Perera voiced her concerns regarding the epidemic on behalf of the WHO. ??
?Dengue cases are increasing globally with more frequent and severe outbreaks. Effective mosquito control through active community participation and taking measures to prevent mosquito bites remain the mainstay of Dengue prevention. These measures need to be further strengthened, particularly in the identified high-risk districts, after experiencing the South West monsoons. Raising awareness among people to ensure they fully participate in preventing and removing vector breeding sites from the environment ? their homes, workplaces and other surroundings are of critical importance. Additionally, people must take adequate personal protection measures to protect themselves against mosquito bites.? ? According to Dr. Perera, the WHO is closely monitoring the situation and liaising with relevant authorities to help control the Dengue uproar. ??
?
WHO has been supporting the government for building capacity of health staff on Dengue management, mosquito control measures and effective community awareness and engagement
?
?The WHO has been supporting the government for building capacity of health staff on Dengue management, mosquito control measures and effective community awareness and engagement. The WHO is liaising closely with the Epidemiology Unit, National Dengue Control Unit and Disaster Preparedness and Response Division of the Health Ministry to provide technical assistance required by the government.? ??
?
Dr. Prachila Samaraweera, Consultant Community Physician attached to the Dengue Control Unit, said fumigation was being carried out islandwide in areas that have been identified as Dengue breeding grounds. ??
?Currently, a rising number of patients have been reported from fourteen districts, among which Colombo, Gampaha, Galle, Matara, Kalutara, Hambantota, Puttalam, Kegalle, Kurunegala and Ratnapura have recorded a high number of Dengue patients. Therefore, instead of fumigating one selected location, we have decided to conduct a special fumigation programme according to a cluster method in selected locations. The fogging programme is carried out as either individual fogging or carpet fogging in these areas. Despite the importance of eliminating areas that are identified as mosquito breeding grounds through fogging, it should be noted that the effect of fogging would remain in the fumigated area only for about half an hour or so. ??
?
Instead of fumigating one selected location, we have decided to conduct a special fumigation programme according to a cluster method in selected locations
?
?Therefore, even if adult mosquitoes in the area are destroyed, if the location provides a favourable atmosphere for mosquito larvae, the total eradication of Dengue mosquitoes through fumigation would remain a futile effort. We have already taken steps to identify and destroy mosquito breeding sites with the cooperation of the military police, government institutes, health officials and the support of the general public. It is important to remove empty cans, tyres and containers from lying on the ground and dispose them properly because the adult female mosquito lays eggs in fresh water accumulated in such containers,??
Dr. Samaraweera said. ??
According to the Dengue Control Programme that would be conducted for three months as per the President?s directive, all schools have been advised to clean their premises once a week on every Friday for one hour which is currently being carried out in an effective manner. ? ??We have also advised all institutes representing the public and private sectors to take similar initiation in their office premises. It is compulsory that patients who have fever for more than forty eight hours get themselves tested for a full blood count. Measures have also been taken to lower the charges of the full blood count to a maximum of Rs. 250 in private medical institutions,? Dr. Samaraweera added.?
?
?
Speaking to,?Sri Jayewardenepura General Hospital Director Dr. Susitha Senaratne said the situation with regard to administering Dengue patients was under control although they experienced a problem few days ago in accommodating patients. ??
?Dengue patients are being admitted to hospital, depending on the availability of beds. However, we see a significant rise in the number of Dengue cases although no deaths were reported from the Sri Jayewardenepura General Hospital during the recent past. Some unknown change may have triggered lately since the number of Dengue larvae has risen fourfold. ??
Rainfall, poor waste management systems as well as natural disasters like floods have further intensified mosquito breeding grounds islandwide. Also, mosquitoes bearing the ?Type 11? virus have increased over time, thereby making patients more vulnerable to the viral fever. We noticed that patients who were diagnosed with Dengue fever suffered from various complications than those who had contracted the disease for the first time. Our hospital staff is doing everything possible within their capacity to treat the patients,? Dr. Senaratne added. ??
?

?
When inquired about the availability of Dextran, he said the drug was available in sufficient quantities. Further, he advised that patients should not be administered any pill other than Paracetamol since that could lead into other complications including excessive bleeding.
?
According to Government Medical Officers? Association (GMOA) Assistant Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge, the Dengue situation in the country has already reached unacceptable levels. He sheds light upon a crucial point with regard to recent developments. ??
?With two hundred deaths per 60,000 Dengue patients, the death prevalence this year remains unacceptably high. Sri Lanka was able to reduce the Dengue death prevalence starting from 2012 until last year with the help of protocols, but this year, this value has reached almost double the value of last year,? he reveals. ??
?The government should take more interest in establishing the reason for this high number. Some of these deaths could have been prevented. So, they need to conduct district-level death reviews to go in depth to investigate the causes for these deaths,? Dr. Aluthge said, adding that doing so would help prevent such events from recurring in the future. ? ?According to Dr. Aluthge, some of these deaths had been caused by ?Quacks? who posed as qualified doctors. They have prescribed painkillers that contraindicate Dengue. ? When inquired if there was a connection between Dengue and garbage, two of the biggest crises the government is facing currently, Dr. Aluthge said there was so. ??
?Although the officials strive to attribute the ever-increasing number of Dengue patients to the change in the viral strain, entomological surveys have revealed an unacceptable increase in mosquito density in the past few months. The solid waste that is lying by the roadside without being collected definitely plays a big part in this. The government should have a national plan on garbage management, and the local authorities? active participation should be ensured,? Dr. Aluthge stresses. ??
When questioned if the government had taken adequate measures to raise public awareness on this concern, Dr. Aluthge said: ?The Health Ministry has recently focused most of its energy on whitewashing the name of SAITM via paid advertisements using public money. They should focus those efforts plus the money on raising awareness on crucial matters like Dengue on mass media, specially focusing on preventing deaths caused from Dengue,? he said. ??
?
The government should take more interest in establishing the reason for this high number. Some of these deaths could have been prevented
?
Dr. Aluthge also commented on the unequal distribution of resources by the government, taking as examples the situations where supplies like fogging machines and vehicles did not reach the areas where they were needed the most. He points out that this is due to the lack of a proper system for the ground-level information to reach administrative levels. ??
Commenting on the situation where there was an abundance of patients in some hospitals, he suggests that the government should use the underutilised wards in nearby hospitals to the National Infectious Disease Hospital and other major hospitals. ? ??Specialist physicians and paediatricians should be assigned to those wards in a visiting basis,? he added presenting GMOA?s solution to the problem. ??
Further, he emphasised the need for a national-level plan to prevent further Dengue casualties which is more crucial than ever. ??
?One of the main reasons for the non-implementation of necessary plans is the lack of proper leadership within the Health Ministry. With the absence of a Health Secretary for more than two months and with an Acting Director General in place of a permanent one, the ministry has failed to achieve their maximum in a crisis situation like this. ? ??We gathered the experts in both curative and preventative sectors of Dengue to one place for an action committee meeting held on Monday, since we see deficiencies in government intervention.
There were discussions about many crucial points like the ground-level participation in sending information, updating the current information gathering systems, and the final conclusions would be presented as a proposal to the government at the end of this week,? he added. ? ?Dr. Aluthge stresses that this is not a time to take sides but a time to put all differences aside, commenting that the Health minister is reluctant to work in unity with the trade unions. ?
??As the GMOA, we ask the president to intervene in this matter and take things into his own hands at least as a temporary measure. We ask him to join us to save the country from the impending disaster,? he concluded. ? ?

Meanwhile, a confidential source who wished to remain anonymous from inside the Central Province healthcare sector divulged that the patient load in many of the main hospitals in the Central Province increased daily, reaching an uncontrollable level. The hospital staff and facilities are highly inadequate to manage the overwhelming number of patients, hence the staff is forced to discharge the patients as soon as they are out of the critical phase.
The source also pointed out that the growing problem of garbage in the Central Province as a main cause for the increasing Dengue incidence in the area, and stressed on the need of practicing proper disposal of garbage. The source also urged the government to take immediate action to supply the equipment like infusion pumps and necessary drugs to the needed hospitals as soon as possible. ??

Dinesh says Speaker promised them a debate
	
Joint opposition MP Dinesh Gunawardane said yesterday that Speaker Karu Jayasuriya had assured them that the adjournment debate on the attack on university students and the GMOA strike would be held today whereas it was cancelled due to the early adjournment of the House.
The adjournment debate which was requested by Mr. Gunawardane yesterday morning was to be held for two hours beginning at 4.30 pm. However, the debate on the excise ordinance which began in the morning only ended at 4.00 pm and Ananda Kumarasiri, who was in the chair at the time, requested MP Gunawardane to move the adjournment motion but he was not present at the time. Parliament was adjourned thereafter.
Convening a press conference last evening inside the Parliament complex, Mr. Gunawadane said the government had deliberately acted to avoid taking part in the debate by its members not speaking during the debate held in the morning on the excise ordinance leading to an early adjournment of the House.
He said the government was attempting to avoid taking the blame for the brutal attack on university students and to suppress the opinion of the opposition on the SAITM issue. He said they would not be deterred by this but come ready to point out the government?s role in these two incidents when Parliament meets today (23).
He said a serious situation had arisen in the country due to the strike launched by the GMOA to protest against Wednesday's brutal attack on university students.
He said a large number of university students, who had gone to the health ministry on its public day to brief the authorities on the issues facing medical education in the country, were baton charged, beaten by the police and had to be hospitalised as a result.
He said it should be considered a national issue where more than 8000 medical students had been inconvenienced due to the issue and added that government could not try to shirk their responsibilities. (By Ajith Siriwardana and Yohan Perera)?

Discuss matters behind doors: Mahela
	
Former Sri Lanka cricketer turned coach Mahela Jayawardene has come in support of country?s national cricketers, who had been criticized as having lack of commitment and fitness following the team?s early exit from the ICC Champions Trophy.
Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekera addressing public forum last week slammed top cricketers as ?overweight? and said the team should be sent for military training to improve their fitness.
However, Jayawardene, a highly acclaimed and respected cricketer, urged authorities to discuss the issues behind closed doors instead of playing to the gallery.
?Agreed on fitness and all should be at a good level. Discuss things in closed doors. Playing to public galleries is politics,? Jayawardene tweeted.
He adds ?If we create a culture when we lose a world event, team is disowned and find fault we will not have players who wants to play with passion.
?Also they will be playing without freedom and be scared of the outcome. Let's not do that... let's be more mature how we conduct ourselves.?
The Minister earlier said:
?It was very ugly to see our cricketers with pot bellies?.I think we should send them to a military camp and train them for six months. Otherwise it?s not going to work.?
Jayawardene?s tweets come a day after Lasith Malinga made a scathing attack on the Minister vilifying the cricketers in public.(Champika Fernando)

Dr. Silva told the Daily Mirror that emergency treatment units were functioning as usual despite the strike.
Meanwhile, GMOA Assistant Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said they commenced the token strike at 8.00 am today and that an emergency Executive Committee meeting was held at 12 noon at the GMOA Head Office to decide on further action.

GMOA strike to continue indefinitely
	
The Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) said today that they would continue the countrywide strike started today until the Government addressed their demands over the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM).
GMOA Secretary Dr. Naveen De Soyza said that all its members would refrain from private practices during the period of strike.
The GMOA strike commenced at 8.00 a.m. today.
GMOA Media Spokesman Dr. Samantha Ananda told a news briefing that they had taken this decision with the unanimous approval of its central committee.
?Yesterday, we have decided to launch a countrywide token strike starting from 8.00 a.m. The recent reason for this decision was to condemn the brutal attack on university students, who protested at the Health Ministry building,? he said.
He said the token strike was launched islandwide except in the emergency units, dengue control units, hospitals in disaster affected areas, maternity, children, kidney and cancer hospitals.
He said the GMOA?s Executive Committee would take a decision with regard to the strike.
He said the decision to launch an indefinite strike was taken for two reasons, including not extending the tenure of Professor Carlo Fonseka as the Chairman of the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC), a decision taken by Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne.
Meanwhile, GMOA Secretary Dr. Naveen De Soyza said the strike would continue until they won.
?We are ready to hold discussions with any party except Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne. We have attempted many times to solve the issue with him through discussions and all went in vain,? he said. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)

The Government is ready to take tough action, which had not been taken previously, with regard to the indefinite strike announced by the GMOA, Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne said today.
Addressing a news conference, the Minister said people condemned the actions of the GMOA?s strike when there was an increase of dengue patients.
?These are not medical doctors. GMOA doctors too receive their salary from the Ministry. If they have an issue with the steps taken to eradicate dengue menace, the doctors should take that responsibility as well,? he said.
He said the strike had been launched with the intention of making way for the GMOA doctors, who are from rural areas to represent the GMOA Executive Council.
Referring to the Wednesday?s protest by the Inter University Students Federation (IUSF) and the protesting students? behaviour, the Minister said they had caused damages amounting to millions of rupees to the Health Ministry complex.
?Some of the students had even harassed the employees of the ministry. Many people who visited the Ministry on Wednesday for the public day assistance were put in a difficult situation. The irony is, after causing many damages to the Ministry building, the students received treatments from the National Hospital, which is under the Ministry,? he said. (By Lahiru Pothmulla)

The police and other intelligence arms did not have an inkling of where the procession of the Inter University Students Federation (IUSF) was heading yesterday until they reached their target and stormed the Health Ministry building Suvasiripaya on Deans Road, IUSF Convener Lahiru Weerasekara claimed.
The ministry officials inside the building at the time the IUSF students rushed into the premises, where they remained for several hours, had been allowed to vacate the premises unharmed.
However the IUSF claimed that they had been able to mislead the intelligence units as to their final target until they stormed the Health Ministry.
Addressing the crowd after the tense situation had been brought under control, the IUSF Convener said all attempts by the intelligence units to figure out were they were heading had been in vain as they had not been able to stop them until they reached their destination.
?Where was the intelligence? You missed your target this time. It hurts not because we were baton charged last time but it because we couldn?t crush your helmets as we maintained a higher level of discipline this time. You may kill our members like you did in Rathupaswala but hundreds more will take our place and our fight will continue until we taste success,? he said.
He further said, yesterday was a milestone in their battle as they were able to teach the authorities a lesson and promised more of the same until the government changes its stance on the SAITM. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

Kiriella adamant Dinesh should have been present
	
The Government cannot be expected to go out of their way all the time to allow the joint opposition to move adjournment motions as and when they want, Leader of the House Lakshman Kiriella said today.
Mr. Kiriella was referring to the statement made by Joint Opposition Parliamentary Group Leader Dinesh Gunawardane that they will request the government allow the adjournment debate on Health Ministry incident today (23). Mr. Gunawardene was not present to move the debate yesterday evening though he requested for it earlier in the morning.
The Leader of the House said the government decided to end the debate on the regulations under the Excise Ordinance at 4.30 pm following the request of Mr Gunawardane for an adjournment debate on the Health Ministry incident. ?Usually if a member wants to move an adjournment motion he has to request for a slot before 12 noon the previous day.
However an MP can move such a motion if it is about an urgent matter provided a minimum of twenty MPs request for it. I agreed to give Mr Gunawardane the chance to move the motion without even calling for 20 MPs to approve it. Mr Gunawardane was not present to move the motion even after us giving him some leeway in the matter, so now the joint opposition cannot blame us if they are not given the chance to move the motion today,? he said.
He charged that Mr Gunawardene was not even present in the Parliamentary premises to move the debate as he was meeting with senior members of the GMOA at the time.
?We don?t know whether we can allow the joint opposition to move the adjournment debate today as there is other business to attend to in the House including condolence votes,? he added.
MP Ananda Kumarasiri who was at the chair at the time sessions were adjourned explained that he had requested the Secretary General Dammika Dassanayake to inform Mr Gunawardane to move the debate.
?I requested the Secretary General to inform him to move the debate before I adjourn proceedings for the day,? he said. He said the debate on the regulations under the Excise Ordinance had ended as all MPs who were due to speak had finished their speeches at that time. (Yohan Perera and Ajith Siriwardana)

Lankan doctor loses appeal over manslaughter of abusive husband
	
A Sri Lankan-born doctor who was jailed after being found guilty of killing her abusive husband has failed in her bid to have her conviction and sentence overturned.
Chamari Liyanage was sentenced to a four-year prison term after being convicted by a jury in February last year of unlawfully killing Diendra Athukorla in Geraldton in 2014.
She was released on parole in March this year after a protracted fight to reinstate her visa to stay in Australia.
Liyanage appealed against her conviction and sentence, but today in a unanimous decision, three Appeal Court judges dismissed her arguments.
She was not in court for the judgment.
During her trial, she maintained that she remembered nothing of what happened to her husband, with the court hearing the couple's five-year marriage was defined by the "worst kind" of escalating sexual, physical and emotional abuse.
She testified she had tried to leave her husband six times, but was trapped in a cycle of abuse with someone who was "a monster".
She was eligible for parole in July last year, but did not seek release because her visa at that time had been revoked and she would have been deported to Sri Lanka.
It is understood Liyanage has voluntarily agreed to suspend her medical licence.
In its decision to dismiss Liyanage's appeal against her sentence, the court said the term she received was appropriate.
"The sentence imposed was a significantly lesser term than the sentences usually imposed for the offence of manslaughter, even in the presence of significant mitigating factors," the judgment read.
"The sentence is not arguably manifestly excessive, either as to the type of sentence or the length of the term of immediate imprisonment which was imposed." (Australian Eastern Standard)

Malinga investigated over 'monkey' remark
	
Fast bowler Lasith Malinga is being investigated by Sri Lanka's cricket board after comparing the country's sports minister to a monkey, the BBC reported.
Sports minister Dayasiri Jayasekara told Sri Lanka's players they were too fat after they failed to reach the Champions Trophy semi-finals.
Malinga, 33, responded by saying he did not care for criticism "from those who are simply warming chairs".
"What does a monkey know about a parrot's nesting hollow?" he added.
"This is like a monkey getting into a parrot's nest and talking about it."
Jayasekara said Malinga's comments were a breach of his contract with the country's cricket board.
"In my criticism of the appalling fitness levels of our players, I did not name Malinga, but he has chosen to put the hat on and attack me publicly," he added.
Malinga won the Indian Premier League title with the Mumbai Indians before the Champions Trophy, and missed Sri Lanka's high-altitude training.
Jayasekara spoke out after Pakistan skipper Sarfraz Ahmed was dropped twice off the bowling of Malinga as Sri Lanka failed to progress from their Champions Trophy group.
"The typical body fat amounts for a cricketer should be about 16%, but most of our players have over 25%," he said.
"I want the results analysed and in future no-one will be included in a national squad if they are above 16%."

Retired Rear Admiral Sarath Weerasekara yesterday handed over a petition to UNHRC President Joaquin Alexander Maza Martelli requesting that action be taken against Human Rights High Commissioner Zeid bin Ra?ad Zeid al-Hussein and Special Rapporteur Monica Pinto for forcing Sri Lanka towards Constitutional Reform, basing their reports on false information and bias.
Addressing the 35th session of the UNHRC yesterday, retired Rear Admiral Weerasekara said both reports have been submitted based on pre-conceived, per-determined notions, were full of contradictions and also violated the norms included in the UN charter.
?I regret to say that both these reports are biased and are full of lies. The OISL panel and the Special rapporteur have based their findings merely on hearsay and gossip and had violated the norms of the UN charter,? he said
Mr. Weerasekara said that the UNHRC should treat Sri Lankan war heroes in the same in which it views war heroes in Great Britain and the United States and not differentiate against them.
Quoting British Prime Minister Theresa May, he said that May had said that she was even willing to change the human rights laws if they get in their way of tackling terrorism and vowed to protect her troops from a legal witch-hunt.
?If you insist that hybrid courts be used to try our war heroes, you are obliged as per your mandate, to recommend the same for the heroic men fighting terrorism today in Britain and the US as well,? Mr. Weerasekara said.
He further said by defeating the LTTE his country's security forces had defended the human rights of all Sri Lankans. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

REUTERS, 21st JUNE, 2017- Saudi Arabia?s King Salman made his son next in line to the throne on Wednesday, handing the 31-year-old sweeping powers as the kingdom seeks radical overhaul of its oil-dependent economy and faces mounting tensions with regional rival Iran.
Although Mohammed bin Salman?s promotion to crown prince was expected among those who follow the royal family closely, the timing was a surprise, putting the kingdom?s future in relatively untested hands.
He replaces his cousin, Prince Mohammed bin Nayef, a veteran security chief who led the Saudi campaign against Islamic State and al Qaeda at a time when Riyadh faces heightened tensions with Qatar and Iran and is locked into a war in Yemen.

REUTERS, 21st JUNE, 2017- From the deck of an aircraft carrier to the sub-zero temperatures of a Himalayan military outpost, tens of thousands of Indians joined Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday to celebrate the third International Yoga Day.
Rains failed to dampen the spirits of about 50,000 people who joined in an outdoor yoga session with the prime minister in a park in Lucknow, capital of the northern state of Uttar Pradesh.
?Yoga has connected the world with India,? Modi, looking relaxed in white track pants and blue-collared T-shirt, told a cheering crowd. ??Yoga is about health assurance. It is not even expensive to practice,? he added.
The Modi?s official Twitter handle, which has more than 30 million followers, has posted pictures of mass yoga sessions in China, Colombia, the United States, Paraguay, Mexico, Italy, Singapore and atop Machu Picchu, a 15th century Inca citadel in Peru.
Social media was flooded with pictures of yoga, the country?s signature cultural export, being performed in various places including an Indian Navy submarine and the landing deck of an aircraft carrier.
?It is not only the world?s longest serving aircraft carrier but also the world?s longest-serving warship. I think the ship must have done lots of pranayaams to be sustaining for so long,? top naval officer Puneet Chadha told a TV channel, referring to a yogic breathing technique.

?
President Donald Trump said on Tuesday that Chinese efforts to persuade North Korea to rein in its nuclear programme have failed, ratcheting up the rhetoric over the death of an American student who had been detained by Pyongyang. ?
Trump has held high hopes for greater cooperation from China to exert influence over North Korea, leaning heavily on Chinese President Xi Jinping for his assistance. The two leaders had a high-profile summit in Florida in April and Trump has frequently praised Xi while resisting criticizing Chinese?
trade practices. ?
?While I greatly appreciate the efforts of President Xi & China to help with North Korea, it has not worked out. At least I know China tried!? Trump wrote?on Twitter. ?
It was unclear whether his remark represented a significant shift in his thinking in the U.S. struggle to stop North Korea?s nuclear programme and its test launching of missiles or a change in U.S. policy toward China. ?
?I think the president is signalling some frustration,? Christopher Hill, a former U.S. ambassador to South Korea, told MSNBC. ?He?s signalling to others that he understands this isn?t working, and he?s trying to defend himself, or justify himself, by saying that at least they tried as opposed to others who didn?t even try.? ?
On Tuesday, a U.S. official, who did not want to be identified, said U.S. spy satellites had detected movements recently at North Korea?s nuclear test site near a tunnel entrance, but it was unclear if these were preparations for a new nuclear test - perhaps to coincide with high-level talks between the United States and China in Washington on Wednesday. ?
?North Korea remains prepared to conduct a sixth nuclear test at any time when there is an order from leadership but there are no new unusual indications that can be shared,? a South Korean Defence Ministry official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity. ?
Seoul was in close consultation with Washington over the matter, the official added.?

Venezuela launches proceedings to remove ?traitor? attorney general
	
?
DPA, 21st JUNE, 2017- Venezuela?s highest court on Tuesday approved proceedings against Attorney General Luisa Ortega, the highest- profile government critic of President Nicolas Maduro, which could lead to her removal.
The Supreme Court approved a lawsuit against her by Socialist lawmaker Pedro Carreno, who accused her of committing a serious offence in the carrying out of her office, according to El Nacional newspaper. ?He also accused her of failing to respect the court?s democratic decisions. Ortega has been called a ?traitor? by the ruling Socialists since March when she opposed a bid by the Supreme Court - loyal to Maduro - to strip the opposition-controlled National Assembly of its powers.

With or without Olympus:  A reading of Trojan Kanthawo
	
I have not read Sartre?s version of The Trojan Women. I have seen Michael Cacoyannis? movie adaptation, but that was not Sartre. I have also seen Dharmasiri Bandaranayake?s Trojan Kanthawo, but that wasn?t Sartre either. When the latter was first staged at Colombo more than two decades ago, it was greeted with the kind of acclaim and popularity that no other political play, except Bandaranayake?s previous work, had enjoyed. So much so, in fact, that with a cast numbering more than 40, a ravishing score by Rookantha Goonethilaka, and choreography by Jerome de Silva, it seemed to belong more to the Wendt than to the Lumbini Theatre. ?
What differentiated Trojan Kanthawo from Eka Adipathi and Makarashaya was that there was nothing satirical about it. Both Eka Adipathi and Makarakshaya were about power and the struggle to retain power through deception. They were also very contemporary, by which I mean they were set in the 20th century, when plays that delved into the abuse of power were laced with humour, with scorn, with derision. The antagonists, who were always the rulers, were subjected to ridicule and parody. They were meant to make you laugh a little, to make you ridicule the system they were in control of. Bandaranayake?s great achievement, going by that, was his ability to bring together humour and anger when critiquing that system. ?
Perhaps it was this that led Piyaseeli Wijegunasingha to criticise those two and praise Trojan Kanthawo. However, the criterion she used to negatively review The Dragon ? that it wasn?t re-contextualised enough ? she discarded to praise Bandaranayake?s transposition of Euripides. Her argument was that a play reflecting a certain context needed to be revisited and, if necessary, revised if it were to be made relevant to a contemporary audience. A friend of mine, having seen these plays, remarked to me that they tried to root a foreign experience here without any success. But that?s not the real problem. The real problem has to do with whether they were adapted cohesively. ?
Piyaseeli might have seen in Makaraskshaya everything that was wrong with the Sinhala political theatre of her time. It thrived on symbols, metaphors, and stark, clearly defined dichotomies which never yielded. For a political play to thrive on such symbols, however, there must be victory and there must be defeat. No one would have been enthralled by those symbols if they didn?t assume their own opposites. The Dragon in Makarakshaya, for instance, is there because of Lancelot. It doesn?t have any meaning outside itself without him. The context as such, in one sense, flows from this dichotomy. Such a dichotomy is missing in Trojan Kanthawo. ?
Euripides staged The Trojan Women in 415 BC as a response to the Athenian enslavement of the women and children of a small island in the Aegean. It was profoundly radical, so radical, in fact, that when he staged it for his time, he staged it for all time. He said what he wanted to say and said it in the simplest way he could. There were no villains and no innocents to compare them with. It was, and it remains, the most poignant lament for the loss of freedom authored by a Greek playwright. ?
Moreover, his message was so aligned with his time because of his victims and the horrible destinies they helplessly await: Cassandra expects Agamemnon, who will make her his concubine, Andromache struggles to raise her only son while doubting his fate, Helen contemplates her own follies that led to her city?s destruction, while Hecuba, the mother figure, looks on wearily at the remains of her motherland. The slaughter of women and children across the Aegean by Euripides? own rulers: this brought out the parallel he might have looked for with the?Trojan War. ?
And in the end, it became both profound and simple. And simplified. In The Dragon, there was room for a conflict that would end in some resolution. But in Trojan Women, the conflict as such could only lead to complete annihilation. So when Dharmasiri Bandaranayake adapted it in the late nineties as a response to the Civil War here, he went for probably the most relevant play he could have gone for, doing away with those dichotomies that had characterised his earlier work. What was so easy about Euripides, however, eventually became what was so difficult about it. ?
The Trojan Women is so matter-of-fact that adaptation or re-contextualisation is possible only with explicit add-ons. This is not something to be met with in The Dragon, or even Brecht?s The Threepenny Opera, both of which were adapted here and were in turn adaptations of popular folklore. The symbols in them are already there, derived from the myths that inspired them. Euripides? play, on the other hand, was conceived with a point of reference that was relevant to his time. The only way an adaptation could work, not surprisingly, was by explicit symbols which showed how the playwright had tried to bring its message closer to home. ?
To a considerable extent at least, this explains why in Trojan Kanthawo, Bandaranayake (together with Rookantha Goonethilaka?s score) brought on stage the modern war tank and the Sinhalese soldier. There was always a sense of political explicitness in his production, as such, that one did not come across in Makarakshaya, by which I am not paying it a compliment: the truth is both Eka Adipathi and Makarakshaya were aware of their relevance, while Trojan Kanthawo could not have projected such a relevance without resorting to symbols. ?
But this wasn?t all. Inasmuch as these symbols were add-ons, they or rather the political undertones beneath them were undone by something that Bandaranayake should have removed, but did not remove: divine intervention. In bringing on stage the army tank and the Sinhalese soldiers, with those laser sound effects that were unfortunately at odds with the seriousness they tried to evoke (which is why I have reservations about Rookantha?s score), he was secularising a war that was rooted in a struggle between the gods, as seen in the beginning with an argument between Poseidon and Athena. By refusing to do away with those gods, however, he confounded us. Again, I am not paying a compliment: without a proper justification for this incongruity, Trojan Kanthawo eventually becomes a hazy political comment. ?
There was nothing divine about the Civil War we endured for three decades. There was nothing that could explain it, rationalise it, except the follies of human beings. That latter point was what Trojan Kanthawo brought out, however roughly and explicitly, with the intrusion of the Sinhalese soldiers. But when I see Poseidon arguing with Athena about how to punish the Greek army, when we know for certain that this same Greek/Sinhala army are enjoying their spoils and captives, I wonder where Bandaranayake was more inconsistent: his choice of allegorising Euripides as a comment on our time, or his choice of retaining the gods as a comment on their time. What was Trojan about our war, and what was Sinhalese and Tamil about their war? The one was divine, the other secular. Can they really subsist? ?
Perhaps a comparison with The Dragon might help. The titular dragon in there was a metaphor, and a very malleable one at that. It was possible to reconfigure, to re-contextualise, without losing the mythical overtones of the original. To be sure, it was a myth turned inside-out, but we knew it was a myth all along, even when Lancelot remarked, ?We?ll have to kill the dragon in all of them? when he discovered that the Burgomaster had taken over his foe?s position. It was a classic case of the mythical not trumping the secular. There was no question about its relevance, consequently: in the end, it resorted to popular folklore to reflect on the present. ?
This leads me to my final question: has Trojan Kanthawo, which was staged again two weeks ago at the Wendt, outlasted its relevance in a way that Bandaranayake?s other work has not? I wouldn?t like to say that it has, but then that?s the only answer I can think of. Forget the point that the war is over: war is everywhere, even in times of peace, and it would be futile to think otherwise. Reflect instead on the central conflict I highlighted before. Wasn?t Bandaranayake?s aim to critique what he conceived as a war fought against our own people? If so, why did he secularise it without doing away with those gods? Particularly when wars are fought with or without Olympus? These are questions, yes, but they make me unhappy, not because they can?t be answered, but because we choose not to answer them. ?
