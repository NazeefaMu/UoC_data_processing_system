Lankan fishermen not willing to discuss with Indian fishermen
	
Local Northern Province Fishermen Associations have rejected Indian Fishermen Associations? request to discuss methods to resolve the long lasting fishermen issue.
The representatives of Indian Fishermen Associations had requested local fishermen organisations to hold a discussion over the allegations that the Indian fishermen poached in Sri Lankan waters using trawler vessels.
The Consultant of the Lankan Fishermen Association Vinayagamurthi Sahadevan had told media that they didn?t believe in a proper solution for the problem by discussing it with the ordinary fishermen associations since discussions held between Sri Lankan and Indian Prime Ministers on the issue had concluded without any proper solution.
?At least there should be groups of government representatives from both sides in holding such discussion, so that the integrity and legality are protected. Otherwise, we are not willing to hold any discussion with their organisations,? he said. (Romesh Madushanka)
