Barclays bank 1Q profits halve; takes new forex charge
	
		 		 
		 
			
AFP: British bank Barclays said yesterday that first-quarter profits halved after taking another 800 million (US $ 1.2 billion, 1.1 billion euros) provision mostly for costs over its alleged role in foreign excha nge market rigging.
Net profit or earnings after taxation sank 52 percent to 465 million in the three months to the end of March compared with a year earlier, Barclays said in a results statement.
Pretax profit however climbed nine percent to 1.8 billion, aided by a strong performance from its restructured investment banking division. That was in line with market expectations.
Barclays -- which was at the heart also of the 2012 Libor interbank interest-rate rigging scandal -- is being probed over the alleged rigging of foreign exchange markets, and reports suggest it could be close to a settlement with British and US regulators.
The troubled bank added yesterday that it set aside another 150 million for costs of compensating customers over the mis-selling of payment protection insurance.
Resolving legacy conduct issues is... an important part of our plan to transform Barclays, said Chief Executive Antony Jenkins.
We are working hard to expedite their settlement and have taken further provisions of 800 million this quarter, primarily relating to foreign exchange.
While we still have much to do, I am pleased with how weve begun 2015.
He added: The investment bank had a good first quarter representing a performance which is more indicative of the potential of the franchise following the repositioning undertaken last year.
The lender added that it has now set aside a total of 2.050 billion for investigations and litigation primarily relating to foreign exchange.

Dual citizenship certificates issued
	
	One hundred and eighty seven Sri Lankans living in abroad received their dual citizenship certificates today from the Immigration and Emigration Department as a result of the new governments decision to reintroduce the dual citizenship system.
	A ceremony was held at the Department today to issue the first set of certificates online. Public Order Minister John Amaratunga said the department had received about 500 applications requesting for dual citizenship.
	The previous regime suspended the system to issue dual citizenship but it had given 2,000 citizenships to their kith and kin and the cronies through the backdoor. Today, under the guidance of the prime minister, we have reintroduced the system to give an equal opportunity to everyone, he said.
	The minister charged that the selective approach of the previous regime had deprived people of their rights, and many intellectuals had left Sri Lanka seeking a haven in other countries.
	He said the process of issuing the certificates could be slow as it had only begun and that those who applied for dual citizenship would be closely screened by a committee comprising department officials.
	We dont need drug addicts or smugglers like the one who was executed in Indonesia. In the past, there were incidents where containers of drugs were released on the orders of high officials. In fact, I strongly recommend that the president introduce the electric chair to eradicate the drug menace from the island. The country only needs valuable and helpful people to come in, he said.
	He said no longer would the applicants have to give bribes (santhosam) to the Department employees to get their work done and that the employees were working hard and depending only on their salaries. (Lahiru Pothmulla and Sanath Desmond)

Ex-Ministry Secy wants barrier removed to return to SL
	
A former ministry secretary who had been named as a suspect in the controversial Norochcholai Lakvijaya coal case, has requested Court to lift the travel restrictions imposed on him so that he could return to the country.
The CID Special Investigations Unit had named former Power and Energy Ministry Secretary M. M. C. Ferdinando who left Sri Lanka on the night of the Presidential Elections on January 8, over the investigations into the import of coal for the Norochcholai Lakvijaya coal power plant.
Presidents Counsel Rienzie Arsecularatne with Counsel Udara Muhandiramge and Thejitha Koralage appearing on behalf of Mr. Ferdinando informed Colombo Fort Magistrates Court that their client was expecting to return in July this year.
The Defence Counsel moved court that the order issued on the Immigration and Emigration Controller preventing the former Ministry Secretary from leaving or arriving in the country be lifted.
Mr. Arsecularatne told Court that his client had gone abroad since his daughter was expecting a baby. The Counsel further told that his client would extend his support to the going investigations. My client is not involved in this transaction. He can be arrested at the airport but the Court should facilitate him to arrive, Mr. Arsecularatne said.
Having considered the submissions, Magistrate Priyantha Liyanage noticed the police Special Investigations Unit OIC to appear in Court on May 13 in order to look into the matter. The request made by defence to facilitate the suspect to arrive is to be considered on that date. 
In this case, four directors attached to the Lanka Coal Company (Private) Ltd had been arrested on charges of having committed a criminal breach of trust causing a loss of Rs.1536 million to the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) when importing coal for the Norochcholai Lakvijaya coal power plant. Later, four directors Kanchana Ratwatte the Chairman of Ceylon Shipping Cooperation Ltd, Ravi Jayawickrama Harbor Master of SLPA, Nimal Bandara and Chulananda Delgoda were ordered to be released on two sureties of one million rupees each.

4 Lankan Tamils held for forging Passports
	
Four Sri Lankan Tamils, allegedly part of a racket that forged Indian passports for sending refugees to European countries, were arrested in Chennai by the sleuths of Q-Branch police, on Tuesday. Police are on the lookout for two others who are suspected to be part of the gang.
The officials received a tip-off that a gang has been active for over a year, luring Lankan Tamil refugees in the State with the promise to help them escape to European countries on forged papers. Sources said the gang took aspiring immigrants to countries like Nepal where Indians can go without visa requirement and from there to the European countries, as there is lesser vigil on documents when compared to the Indian airports. Following this, a series of raids were conducted at several places, netting the quartet from an undisclosed location in Chennai.
The four were identified as Balan alias Balachandran (48) and Lingaran aliyas Athiyaman (40), both from Jaffna, Dhanushan (22), and Jeyadasan (43), both from Mullaitheevu, said officials. Officials also recovered a dozen forged Indian Passports and around `1.50 lakh from their possession.
It is learnt that Balan, suspected to be the mastermind, had been luring refugees desperately trying to immigrate to European countries.
The racket will levy a hefty charge for forging and processing the travel documents. They managed to send some people to France, but the numbers are not yet known, said a senior official.
The gang was getting ready to dispatch a batch of about 15 people to France and other European countries when they were arrested.
Asked as to how much the gang was charging and how many persons have been sent so far, the official maintained that disclosing the information will disrupt their investigation which is only at a preliminary stage now.
On France being chosen, the official said refugees perhaps believed that it was easy to get a job and better life in that country. It may also be because they think they might get the refugee status and citizenship in France easily, the official opined. (The Indian Express)

How much is enough Ceylinco Life asks in Retirement Planning Month campaign
	
The impact of inflation on long-term savings, the principal bugbear in pensions computing, provides the theme for a month-long, country-wide campaign by Ceylinco Life this May to promote retirement planning.
How much is enough is the question the life insurance leader will pose in its communications as well as its engagement with thousands of Sri Lankans, as a 4,000 plus sales team takes to the streets for the companys eighth annual Retirement Planning Month exercise.
May has been the companys designated Retirement Planning Month since 2008, and every year, the sales team is tasked with focussing on this segment of business during the month.
This year, a special consumer promotion supports the door-to-door interaction of the sales force with target consumers, offering them a chance to receive a valuable gift from Ceylinco Life when they purchase a retirement plan or top up an existing retirement plan in order to combat the effects of inflation.
The rising cost of living necessitates a periodic evaluation of ones current level of savings to ascertain whether it is enough to sustain future expenses and to live comfortably in retirement, Ceylinco Life Managing Director/CEO R. Renganathan said.
As a professional and ethical promoter of life insurance and retirement plans, it is our duty to educate customers about this aspect and the importance of studying the rates of return offered by the different products in the market.
Ceylinco Life Retirement Plans provide a higher return than most fixed deposit and savings accounts, he said. Proceeds from retirement plans are exempt from tax.
Ceylinco Life Retirement Plans can even be purchased online by visiting the company website www.ceylincolife.com.
In April last year, the company made saving for retirement even easier by adding three new flexible retirement plans to its portfolio of retirement planning products. This made it possible for saving to be commenced with as little as Rs.1,000, with payments made monthly, quarterly, half-yearly or annually for a term of five years.
Ceylinco life has close to a million lives covered by active policies. The company is acknowledged as the benchmark for innovation in the local insurance industry for its work in product research and development, customer service, professional development and corporate social responsibility.
Independently rated one of Sri Lankas most valuable brands, Ceylinco Life has maintained its leadership of the countrys long-term insurance sector from 2004 onwards. The company operates the largest branch network among local life insurance companies and has won multiple international and local awards for its commitment to the community and success in brand equity building.

Parliamentarians Vasudeva Nanayakkara and Wimal Weerawansa today submitted a complain to the Bribery Commission regarding a probe into a Ports Authority land that was provided to a private company on which the Supreme Court had earlier asked that action be taken against ex-President Chandrika Kumaratunga.
The former ministers charged that the Bribery Commission, the Criminal Investigation Division and the Attorney General had been directed by the Supreme Court to look into the matter but no action had been taken for the past seven years. 
The 10-acre land that belonged to the Ports Authority was used for bunkering. During Chandrika Kumaratungas regime it was handed over to a private company, Nanayakkara said. 
The parliamentarian had then filed a petition in the Supreme Court which had directed the authorities to re-acquire the land and compensate the ports authority workers who were unemployed due to the move. 
No action has been taken for the past seven years and therefore we decided to complain the Bribery Commission of the Supreme Court order and inquire into the action that have been taken over the matter, the former National Languages and Social Integration Minister of said. (Sanath Desmond)
