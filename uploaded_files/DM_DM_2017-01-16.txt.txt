Abbas warns against moving US embassy to Jerusalem
	

VATICAN CITY AFP Jan14,
2017 - Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas warned Saturday that moving the US embassy in Israel to Jerusalem would deal a huge blow to hopes for Middle East peace, as he opened a Palestinian embassy at the Vatican, Abbas added that anything which legitimised the illegal Israeli annexation of Jerusalem would bury the hopes for a two-state solution, and fuel extremism in our region. 
Speaking briefly to reporters, Abbas reiterated his opposition to the possible transfer of the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem as President-elect Donald Trump had indicated he might do. 
We cannot say anything yet because it has not happened... I hope it will not happen, Abbas said.

AIA Vitality, a new and rewarding platform for healthy living
	

Traditionally, insurers provide financial assistance when things go wrong. For example, if you pass away, your death benefits will be paid or if you are hospitalized, your bills will be compensated. AIA Insurances game-changing approach is intended at turning this convention around and making the experience a positive one. Instead of the usual if you die-we pay model, AIA has found a way to motivate you to get fit, stay healthy and live life to the fullest.
The AIA Vitality programme, the first of its kind in Sri Lanka, is a science-backed wellness programme that provides participants with the knowledge, tools and motivation to improve their health. Its an easy-to-use application which you can download for free from the Google play-store or the Apple app-store.
It gives you weekly targets, which can be achieved by staying active, such as working out in the gym, running or quite simply, just walking. If you achieve the weekly targets, you get rewarded with a choice of exciting rewards, including mobile top-ups, movie tickets, discount vouchers from e-tailers and taxi vouchers.
AIA CEO Pankaj Banerjee emphasized, AIA Vitality uses extensive science-backed research and behavioural economics, which shows that incentives can work to encourage people towards adopting and sustaining healthier behaviours.
He added, AIAs mission is to help people live, longer, healthier, better lives. We really want to focus on the customeron helping them in taking care of their health and wellness.
Adding on to that Chief Marketing Officer Nikhil Advani said, Life insurance has always been associated with, well, death and claims. But thats exactly the perception we want to change. Were changing the message of you die, we pay, to well help you live a better life. The programme has been tremendously successful in other AIA markets and we are excited to launch it in Sri Lanka.

Government workers had entered the formerly rebel-held area in the Wadi Barada region near Damascus on Friday to begin restoring water to the capital after weeksof shortages. 
Fierce fighting broke out after midnight between regime forces, fighters from Hezbollah and the rebels, after gunmen killed the negotiator, Ahmed al-Ghadban, said Rami Abdel Rahman of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. 
Ghadban had been on his way to the Ain al-Fijeh spring with maintenance teams, he told AFP. 
The two sides accused each other of killing the retired army officer, who had only assumed his duties to restore the water supply on Saturday.

Coca-Cola interested in using SL as production hub
	
The Asia Pacific heads of multinational Coca-Cola has expressed their willingness to develop Sri Lanka as a production hub to re-export their products to India.
A Finance Ministry statement said this was conveyed during a meeting Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake had with Coca-Cola Asia Pacific Group President John Murphy and Executive Vice President Irial Finan last weekend, in Colombo, a Finance Ministry statement said. India has the highest demand for Coca-Cola products in the South Asian region.
The two Coca-Cola officials had pointed out that making Sri Lanka a production hub for Coca-Cola could earn the country a huge sum of foreign exchange while generating job opportunities for the youth.
The two officials had also discussed with Karunanayake about the use of Sri Lankas natural water resources and tea-related products to manufacture Coca-Cola brands and re-export the final products.
The officials had also expressed their concern over the stability of Sri Lankas rate of taxation.

Constitution outdated; needs to be changed: UNP
	
The United National Party (UNP) has not changed its stance on changing the current Constitution, UNP MP Nalin Bandara Jayamaha told a news conference today.
The party believes that this Constitution is outdated and it should be changed in keeping with todays needs. It is interesting to see those who opposed the 1978 constitution now attempting to cling to the Constitution, he said.
The MP said it was too immature to talk about the next presidential election because no decision has been taken on abolishing the presidency or on the new Constitution.
The UNP will act as it did during the previous presidential election where we chose President Maithripala Sirisena as the common candidate without anybody knowing about it, he said.
When asked whether the government could function any longer with different views expressed by the parties in the coalition, the MP said it was not an issue because at the end of the day, the government would arrive at the correct decision despite the differences on policy matters.

Don't imprison soldiers for GSP: Rathana Thera
	
Ven. Athuraliye Rathana Thera said today that security forces personnel should not be imprisoned in connection with war crimes for the sake of regaining the GSP+ facility from the EU.
After remaining politically silent for some time he told a media briefing that the government had mentioned about a hybrid court as one of the conditions to regain this trade concession.
Do we have to imprison military personnel who defeated terrorism to regain the GSP. Dont we have any self-confidence However, today we have re-gained this facility sans a hybrid court, the Thera said.
He criticized the government for co-sponsoring the UNHRC Resolution on Sri Lanka to probe allegations of human rights violation during the final phase of the armed conflict.
The UN resolution states that war crimes had taken place and that we need to probe the allegations in a transparent manner. What we said about these allegations is not what we should have said. We said a war took place and it was bad and therefore, we should follow the guidelines set by foreign countries. Is that what we should do the Thera asked.
He said he too knew envoys from the US and India and that there was no unusual pressure from them.
The monk said all wars were ruthless and that terrorism had to be defeated.
Sri Lanka should inform the international community that we are prepared for National Reconciliation today. We are not curtailing the rights of any citizen and as a democratic and civilised country we will always ensure the human rights of all people, he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

## Title: FitchRatings affirms nine Sri Lankan banks

FitchRatings affirms nine Sri Lankan banks
	
Fitch Ratings has affirmed the long-term issuer default ratings (IDRs) of the following Sri Lanka-based banks: National Savings Bank (NSB) at B+; outlook negative; Bank of Ceylon (BOC) at B+; outlook negative; DFCC Bank PLC (DFCC) at B+; outlook negative.
Fitch has also affirmed the national ratings of the following banks: Peoples Bank (Sri Lanka) (Peoples Bank) at AA+(lka); outlook stable; Commercial Bank of Ceylon PLC (CB) at AA(lka); outlook stable; Hatton National Bank PLC (HNB) at AA-(lka); outlook stable; National Development Bank PLCs (NDB) at A+(lka); outlook stable; Sampath Bank PLC (Sampath) at A+(lka); outlook negative; Seylan Bank PLC (Seylan) at A-(lka); outlook stable
The rating actions follow Fitchs periodic review of the large banks peer group.

Key rating drivers IDRS, national ratings and senior debt
Fitch has revised its sector outlook for Sri Lankan banks to negative from stable. Fitch believes the operating conditions have become more challenging, as signalled by the downgrade and outlook revision on the sovereign rating to B+/Negative in February 2016 from BB-/Stable. Fitch expects rising macroeconomic pressure to strain banks credit metrics.
Fitch sees capitalisation as a significant issue facing the sector, stemming from thin capitalisation at state banks and diminishing capitalisation at most non-state banks. The Central Bank of Sri Lanka has issued the Basel III capital requirements that banks are expected to comply with from July 2017. Fitch believes most banks will need to raise capital to meet the targets set for 2019, although there may be no immediate issues regarding compliance. Stronger capital buffers are desirable to counterbalance structural balance sheet issues, such as high credit concentration and absorb unexpected losses.
Sri Lankas operating environment is a key rating driver for the banking sector. It constrains the viability rating of some banks, as it is rare for a viability rating to be assigned above the sovereign rating, however well banks score on other factors.

Banks with long-term ratings driven by sovereign support
The IDRs and national long-term ratings of NSB and BOC and the national long-term rating of Peoples Bank reflect Fitchs expectation of extraordinary support from the sovereign (B+/Negative), albeit constrained by its limited ability.
Fitch sees state support for NSB as stemming from its policy mandate of mobilising retail savings and investing them in government securities. The National Savings Bank Act contains an explicit deposit guarantee and Fitch believes authorities would support, in case of need, the banks depositors and senior unsecured creditors to maintain confidence and systemic stability. Fitch has not assigned a Viability Rating to NSB, as it is considered to be a policy bank.
Fitch expects support for BOC and Peoples Bank to stem from their high systemic importance, quasi-sovereign status, role as key lenders to the government and full state-ownership.
The negative outlook on the IDRs of NSB and BOC reflects the negative outlook on the sovereigns rating. The outlook on the two banks national long-term ratings is stable, as national ratings reflect a banks creditworthiness relative to the best credit in Sri Lanka, and as such, are unlikely to change due to sovereign rating action.
BOCs Viability Rating of b+ reflects its thin capitalisation and weak asset quality. This is counterbalanced by its strong domestic funding franchise, which is underpinned by state linkages. Fitch considers state support as BOCs primary rating driver, even though its Viability Rating is at the same level as its Support Rating Floor.
The US dollar senior unsecured notes issued by NSB and BOC are rated at the same level as the banks long-term foreign-currency IDRs, as the notes rank equally with other senior unsecured obligations. The notes have a recovery rating of RR4.
The national long-term rating of Seylan reflects Fitchs expectation of state support, which is attributable to its state shareholding and higher share of banking sector deposits relative to some peers. Seylan has a lower support-driven rating due to its smaller market share compared with larger peers.
Fitch believes Seylans standalone financial strength has improved, reaching the same level as it support-driven rating. However, Seylans asset quality remains weaker against peers despite its reported gross non-performing loan ratio improving to 5.12 percent at end-3Q16, from a peak of 29.7 percent at end-2009. Further, Seylans reserve coverage is significantly weaker than higher-rated peers.
Seylans Sri Lanka rupee-denominated senior debt is rated at the same level as its national long-term rating, as the debentures rank equally with other senior unsecured obligations

Banks with long-term ratings driven by intrinsic strength
The national long-term rating of CB reflects its measured risk appetite relative to peers, strong funding profile as seen through a sustained high share of current and savings deposits (45 percent at 3Q16), solid franchise and sound performance. The ratings reflect Fitchs expectation that CBs non-domestic operations will remain small, even though the bank has been expanding its international presence.
The national long-term rating of HNB reflects its strong domestic franchise, satisfactory capitalisation and improving financial profile. This is counterbalanced by a higher risk appetite relative to better-rated peers. HNBs risk appetite, as seen from its historically above-industry loan growth of 25.5 percent in 2015 versus the industrys 21.1 percent (2014: 14.0 percent versus the industrys 13.7 percent), has put pressure on its funding, liquidity and capitalisation.
DFCCs Viability Rating captures its developing commercial banking franchise alongside its core project financing business and still-high capitalisation levels (end-3Q16: Fitch Core Capital (FCC) ratio of 22.6 percent). The negative outlook on DFCCs IDR reflects the probable adverse effect on the banks credit profile from the sovereigns deteriorating credit profile and increasing risks in the domestic operating environment. Fitch maintains the negative outlook on DFCCs national long-term rating due to its declining capital buffers from weaker asset quality, below-average internal capital generation and high loan growth, relative to peers.
DFCCs US dollar notes are rated at the same level as its long-term foreign-currency IDR. The notes have a recovery rating of RR4.
The national long-term rating of Sampath reflects its lower capitalisation and higher risk appetite relative to peers, which counterbalance its growing franchise and satisfactory asset quality. Sampaths gross loan growth of 15.3 percent in 9M16 continues to outpace the industrys 10.3 percent growth (Sampath 2015: 24.2 percent, industry 2015: 21.1 percent).
Fitch expects capitalisation to further weaken in the absence of capital injections, as the banks retained earnings are insufficient to sustain its capitalisation - especially in the light of higher capital requirements. The banks regulatory Tier I capital ratio continued to deteriorate and stood at 7.8 percent by end-9M16, from 8 percent at end-2015 (2013: 10.1 percent).
NDBs ratings reflect its satisfactory asset quality, weaker franchise and lower capitalisation (end-3Q16: FCC ratio of 12.4 percent) relative to higher-rated peers. Fitchs believes the banks higher risk appetite could dilute the benefit of any possible capital infusions.
HNBs and DFCCs Sri Lanka rupee-denominated senior debt is rated at the same level as their national long-term rating, as the debentures rank equally with other senior unsecured obligations.

Support rating and support rating floor
The support rating and support rating floor of privately-owned DFCC reflect its relative lower systemic importance, in Fitchs view.
The support ratings and support rating floors of NSB and BOC reflect the states ability and propensity to provide support to the banks given their high importance to the state and high systemic importance.

Subordinated debt
The old-style Basel II Sri Lanka rupee-denominated subordinated debt of BOC, CB, HNB, DFCC, Sampath, NDB and Seylan is rated one notch below their national long-term ratings to reflect the subordination to senior unsecured creditors.

Rating sensitivities IDRS, national ratings and senior debt
The banks credit profiles are sensitive to changes in the operating environment. Negative rating action could also result from pressure on bank credit profiles through an increase in risk appetite, such as sustained rapid loan expansion or rising exposure to more susceptible segments, unless this is counterbalanced through higher capital buffers and stronger risk management.

Banks with long-term ratings driven by sovereign support
Changes to the sovereign rating or perception of state support to NSB and BOC could result in a change in their support rating floors. Fitch may downgrade NSBs national long-term rating if there is a reduced expectation of state support through, for instance, the removal of preferential support or a substantial change in NSBs policy role or deviation from mandated core activities indicating its reduced importance to the state.
A downgrade of BOCs IDR would most likely result from the sovereigns weakened ability to support the bank manifested through a lower sovereign rating. Visible demonstration of preferential support for BOC and Peoples Bank in the form of an explicit guarantee may be instrumental to an upgrade of their national long-term ratings.
NSBs and BOCs senior debt ratings are sensitive to changes in the banks long-term IDRs. The two banks recovery ratings are sensitive to Fitchs assessment of potential recoveries for creditors in case of default or non-performance.
BOCs viability rating may come under pressure if there is a continued decline in capitalisation through a surge in lending or further decline in asset quality alongside high dividend payouts. Further deterioration in the operating environment, reflected in a decline of BOCs key credit metrics, could negatively affect its viability rating.
A downgrade of Seylans rating could result from a reassessment of state support and large reversal in recent asset quality improvements, together with a weakening financial profile. In the absence of changes to Fitchs support assessment, an upgrade of Seylans rating would be contingent on further improvements in its standalone profile through improved asset quality and provisioning, mainly stemming from recovery of legacy non-performing loans, while maintaining its other credit metrics in line with higher-rated peers.

Seylans senior debt ratings will move in tandem with its national long-term rating.

Banks with long-term ratings driven by intrinsic strength
Enhanced loss absorption buffers against a volatile operating environment could be positive for CBs national long-term rating. The banks ratings could be downgraded if its ability to withstand cyclical asset quality deterioration declines due to lower earnings and capitalisation. In addition, any marked weakening in its deposit franchise and deviation from its measured risk appetite, both viewed by Fitch as key factors that differentiate CB from its lower-rated peers, would be negative.
An upgrade of HNBs national long-term rating is contingent on the bank achieving sustained improvements in its financial profile, particularly in its funding, and a moderation of its risk appetite. A rating downgrade could result from a significant increase in risk-taking and operating environment-related risks, unless sufficiently mitigated through capital and financial performance. Further weakening of HNBs liquidity position could also negatively affect its rating.
The outlook on DFCCs national long-term rating may be revised to stable if the bank can sustain capital buffers to sufficiently cushion its weaker asset-quality amid higher operating environment-related risks. Fitch expects the bank to maintain higher capitalisation to offset the risk stemming from its project finance portfolio  a core business for DFCC since inception.
DFCCs IDRs and national long-term rating could be downgraded if there is sustained deterioration in its capitalisation, particularly if its asset quality were to also simultaneously deteriorate.
The ratings can also come under pressure if there is further weakening of the operating environment. DFCCs recovery rating is sensitive to Fitchs assessment of potential recoveries for creditors in case of default or non-performance.
The outlook on Sampath could be revised to stable if it can fundamentally improve its capital buffers commensurate with its risk profile. Sampaths ratings could be downgraded if there is a sustained decline in capitalisation, increase in risk-taking or a sharp decline in asset quality.
NDBs national long-term rating may be downgraded if the bank cannot sustain its capitalisation at a level commensurate with its risk profile. An upgrade could result from NDBs ability to sustain a sufficient capital buffer that can counterbalance weaknesses in its credit profile.
The assigned senior debt ratings will move in tandem with the banks national long-term rating.

Support rating and support rating floor
Reduced propensity of the state to support systemically important banks could result in a downgrade in the assigned support ratings and support rating floors, but Fitch sees this to be unlikely in the medium-term. A change in the sovereigns ratings could also lead to a change in the banks support ratings and support rating floors.
Subordinated debt
The assigned subordinated debt ratings will move in tandem with the banks national long-term rating.

## Title: FROM IMPUNITY TO ACCOUNTABILITY: WILL IT BE DONE

FROM IMPUNITY TO ACCOUNTABILITY: WILL IT BE DONE
	
Sri Lankans have suffered serious set-backs for the past several decades due to impunity. It is becoming an increasingly difficult crisis beyond redemption. Government loses billions due to corruption, mismanagement and misappropriation of State funds. There is conspicuously an absence of investigation, justice or punishment. Robert Rothberg, a leading scholar of failed states had said that even when a State was weak, failing, failed or collapsed, ruling families and cadres arrogate to themselves increasing portions of the available pie. 
All these constitute serious breaches of governments obligations. The failure by public authorities to bring perpetrators to book by imposing punishments and their reluctance to grant redress to victims is the simple definition of impunity. Impunity inheres where there is a deficit of democratic structures of accountability, fairness and impartiality. 
Origins of impunity in Sri Lanka could be directly traced to the concept of presidential immunity in the 1978 Constitution. Presidents could not be sued during the tendency of the term, whether civil or criminal, prior to the enactment of the 19th Amendment. It was spoofed that the spouse could not have even filed a divorce suit at least. 
Furthermore, both 1972 and 1978 Constitutions had included provisions for the politicians to make higher appointments to the judiciary and the public service. Executive President constitutionally wielded enormous powers. It had subsequently invaded all other areas in the government. Chief Justice, Attorney-General and the other key appointments were made at the behest of the President. The President appoints the members of the Judicial Services Commission (JSC) too. It is the JSC, which is entrusted with the powers to appoint promote, transfers, disciplinary control and dismissal of judicial officers in lower courts. 

Impunity is the foremost indicator of the absence of institutions that promote pluralism, participation, impartiality, accountability and fairness. The 18th Amendment was a manifestation of the consolidation of wider powers to the Executive President. This was passed in Parliament with 161 voting in favour and 17 against. This created further isolation between the ruled and the ruler. Members who crossed over from the Opposition from time to time had been made Cabinet Ministers, the country with the largest Cabinet in the whole world. If sheep elect wolves to be their shepherds, then they deserve to be eaten  Anonymous. 
During the past few decades, politicians, their henchmen, government servants with direct accessibility to power and authority; or friends, relations, children of those in power, if they had committed wrongful acts, such as criminal, civil, administrative, had not been brought under investigation or inquiry. Perpetrators finally had escaped arrest, prosecution etc. for wrongdoing. Impunity was consequently a creation by the State. 
President has the power in terms of Article 34 of the Constitution to grant a pardon to an offender convicted in any court. A wife of former minister Milroy Fernando, had been sentenced to death for double murder by the Colombo High Court. She had been freed on a Presidential pardon to mark International Womens Day along with two foreign nationals, who had been convicted for drug offences! Many more who have been convicted similarly are yet languishing in jails! And why 
Furthermore, other victims, who had suffered numerous ordeals due impunity, suffer endlessly without any of hope of being able to see justice and fair play. Ending impunity and forging justice is therefore a distant dream unless there is meaningful political consensus to strengthen rule of law and to restrain the abuse of power. 

"Due to political interference and manipulation, Police, the Attorney-General and the judiciary, had left ample room for criticism, and had acted biased without taking appropriate measures against perpetrators"

Due to political interference and manipulation, Police, the Attorney-General and the judiciary, had left ample room for criticism, and had acted biased without taking appropriate measures against perpetrators. The authorities thereby had overlooked prosecution, trial and suitable punishment in terms of the law. Attorney-General is the countrys principal prosecutor, who plays a crucial role within the criminal justice system. Due to endless politicisation of the Attorney-Generals office, there has been serious allegations that the Attorney-General too had contributed to the strengthening of the culture of impunity in the country. 
The independence of the judiciary has been manipulatively exonerated, which had seriously impacted the rule of law. There had been broad consensus that the concentration of intense powers in one individual with immunities attached had been inimical to the constitutional balance of powers. Culture of impunity has accordingly been institutionalised, systematized, at their will, with reduced accountability and transparency. Presidential system guaranteed a political system  the winner takes it all and favoured anti-democratic dictatorial politics.  Arent there two types of immunities the world over Our MPs too, like in UK, USA, Australia, New Zealand and Canada, by law have been provided with immunity in Parliament to take part in debates without entertaining fears or worries about lawsuits. Remember, immunity beyond that would be controversial. Parliamentarians like Mervyn Silva and many others enjoyed immunity in Parliament, while enjoying unwritten benefits of impunity outside the precincts of Parliament. How about their children and similar mischief-makers who broke law and created quarrels in night clubs, without appropriate legal action against them 
Unlike in developed countries, we have diverse examples where crooks, fraudsters, liars and the like contesting political office having agreed to abide by 12th March agreement. On the other hand, people elected the present regime, to work effectively to provide solutions to an ailing democracy to restore good governance and rule of law. Shouldnt they remember that they too are under a microscope Citizens, international community, potential investors and the like are also watching us.


We also had a Prime Minster, who had been accused of issuing a letter to Customs authorities to release a container with contraband. We also had powerful politicos, who had denied wrong-doing and involvement even after the Customs had revealed that there had been container loads of Ethanol imported illegally. Minister Bathiudeen had allegedly threatened the Mannar District Judge Anthony Pillai after the latter had ordered the arrest of a group of men, alleged to be supporters of the minister. The minister had telephoned the Judge to change the verdict and when he had refused to comply with the ministers request, a group allegedly under the political patronage of the minister, had pelted stones at the court building and had set fire to a section of it. Police had produced a B report that the attackers had caused damage amounting to Rs. 1.4 million. IMPUNITY ON LARGE SCALE!  Our politicos cleverly abuse and manipulate political office with efficiency and effectiveness to maximise the outcomes to themselves and their kith and kin. All these had finally led to the erosion of rule of law and bad governance; the loss of public trust in law enforcement authorities and State institutions.


In Sri Lanka, impunity has now become an integral part in day to day governance. We have experienced instances where elected representatives had taken the law into their own hands and escaped, without being punished due to impunity. 
Shouldnt the President consider creation of an independent office of the Attorney-General accountable to Parliament as in the case of Secretary-General of Parliament, Auditor-General and the Commissioner-General of Election under the present circumstances. If so, the AG will be able to handle his onerous duties with professional rectitude and fearlessness. 
President and the Prime Minster, should be conscious that the dilemma they face is politically volatile in post-war Sri Lanka. Because impunity is corrosive. People suffer in the hands of police, other bureaucrats without redress. Women do not venture out at night. There are senseless killings, bribery, torture, etc. Indifferent or hostile public officers including dangerously low policing. Ongoing trends therefore favouring impunity must be reversed without delay. The government should also facilitate the judiciary to hear corruption, criminal cases etc. through a rapid response mechanism for timely action against IMPUNITY.  Justice Mark Fernando had said  What is required is a fair-minded group of persons. Not just Constitutions, just laws or just institutions. Right persons and not institutions because Paradise even on earth is not a physical place of material development but a set of values, fairness, tolerance, non-discrimination and so on. Impunity is therefore a governance issue. The remedy is that the political leadership will require the POLITICAL WILL to involve effective functioning of all institutions. 
It was because the institutions had failed and had broken down, that they had finally given birth to the culture of impunity. All these, ultimately, have benefited the haves at the expense of the have-nots, and has led to endless corruption, growing organized crime, drug rackets, poor economic growth and destabilization of the country. Professor Andrew Scott at Deakin University argues  More effective political leadership and judgement will be needed to channel these sentiments into policy change. Shouldnt the countrymen think we need good leaders 
RIGHT PERSONS

Global Park workers on strike over haphazard termination
	
A federation of trade unions today staged a protest opposite the Global Transportation and Logistics (Pvt) Ltd (Global Park) in Seeduwa, demanding immediate solutions to the sudden removal of 66 workers, who were members of the federation.
Addressing the media, Free Trade Zones and General Services Employees Unions Secretary Niroshan Viduranga said that they have been terminated haphazardly from the company since last Friday.
Today also we are here to do our job. But the authorities are not letting us in. Therefore we are forced to protest in order to win our rights. We were on leave till January 13. But when we reported for work on 13th, the management had issued a list of employees whose services have been terminated, he said.
He said the discussions with the owner of Global Park, Onella Karunanayake, regarding this were proved futile. (Ranjith Ferdinandaz)

Govt. to consider specifying locations for staging protests
	
The government is considering the possibility of specifying locations in Colombo City where people could stage protests or demonstrations, instead of staging them on the streets or elsewhere, it is learnt. This is would be in line with practices in various cities of the world, where people may assemble only at specified locations to stage their protests.
This was mentioned by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe when he met senior police officers at Temple Trees last Friday. Sources from the Ministry of Law and Order said this came up for discussion when the police officers informed the prime minister that protests held across Colombo and in locations such as Parliament Road had become a problem for them.
The prime minister had also informed the police that they would be provided with new equipment such as helicopters in the future. Helipads will be set up all over the country soon, and police will also get an opportunity to carry out operations using helicopters, he had said.
He had also stressed the need for for policemen to develop bilingual skills as this would help Sinhalese policemen to work in Tamil and thereby serve the people better.
Law and Order Minister Sagala Ratnayake, who also participated in the discussions, had promised that the salary increment proposed in the budget would be given soon. He had said police personnel would be given a course on dealing with cybercrimes.
Inspector General of Police (IGP) Pujith Jayasundara, other senior police officers and Minister of Prison Reforms and Resettlement D M Swaminathan had also participated in the discussions.

GSP: No promises given to the EU, says Ajith
	
Sri Lanka had not agreed to any condition that would be unfavorable to people to gain GSP Plus, a Deputy Minister said yesterday.
 We have not agreed to grant federalism or to take away the status given to Buddhism in the Constitution and such things have not been presented as conditions, he said at a media briefing while highlighting that the conditions that had been put out by the EU were minor ones pertaining to Human Rights and preserving the rule of law.
The Deputy Minister said the fate of the GSP Plus status for Sri Lanka would be decided in two months time when the European Parliament took up a resolution whether to grant it or not.
We are confident that the European Parliament Members will approve it without any issue as all 28 member states of the European Union is in favour of granting GSP Plus status to Sri Lanka, he said.
Asked whether exit of the UK would dilute the benefit Sri Lanka could get out of GSP Plus status, the Deputy Minister said it would not, to a large extent.
Around 36 percent of Sri Lankas export was going to the Europe countries and the GSP Plus would help Sri Lanka to increase its exports, he added.
Referring to the stance take by the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) that Executive Presidency should continue, Mr. Perera said United National Party (UNP) would not give up its effort to abolish it.
In such a situation he said talking of a UNP candidate for the 2020 Presidential election was not relevant and was too early.(Yohan Perera)

HSBC risks losing advantage with year-long delay in Chinese banking push
	
REUTERS: HSBCs ambitions to establish an investment banking franchise in China have hit a roadblock, with the bank still waiting for approval for its partnership with a state-owned fund more than a year after it announced the venture.
The partnership is a key part of the banks ambition to grow annual profits in the fast-growing southern region of China from US $100 million (81.50 million) to $1 billion in the medium term, and as growth in China slows, HSBC has delayed other expansion plans it said would help achieve that goal.
HSBC announced on Nov. 2, 2015 the proposed venture with Shenzhen Qianhai Financial Holdings Co Ltd, with HSBC set to own a majority 51 percent stake while foreign peers are currently capped at a maximum of 49 percent in Chinese partnerships.
The bank is expected to get the go-ahead for the venture eventually, sources familiar with the matter said, but the delay has reduced the advantage HSBC could have stolen over rivals as China relaxes rules on foreign players in its markets.
A spokesman for HSBC in Hong Kong said the bank continues to seek the required approval, declining to comment on the timing.
The proposed HSBC-Qianhai firm would be able to trade as well as underwrite stocks and bonds for Chinese firms, unlike foreign rivals who operate under more restrictions.
HSBC a year ago was saying here we go, it was all guns blazing but we are still waiting..., said a Hong-Kong based consultant who works with the bank. HSBC did not publicly set out a timeline for when it expected to receive the go-ahead but the process is taking longer than analysts expected.
Chirantan Barua of Bernstein research wrote in April last year that he expected approval by the July-September quarter.
The HSBC joint venture has had the longest wait of any pending Sino-foreign securities joint venture, and two such ventures have received approval since HSBC submitted its application, according to data compiled by Hong Kong consultancy firm Quinlan & Associates.

Income of richest 10% in SL increase by 15%
	
The richest 10 per cent of the population in countries like Sri Lanka, China, India, Indonesia, Laos and Bangladesh have seen their share of income increase by more than 15 per cent, a study released by rights group Oxfam said.
According to NDTV, the study titled An Economy for the 99% was released ahead of the World Economic Forum (WEF) annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland.
The report said, on the other hand, the poorest 10 per cent have seen their share of income fall by more than 15 per cent.
"Due to a combination of discrimination and working in low-pay sectors, women's wages across Asia are between 70-90 per cent of men's," it said. 
On a positive note, it said there have been absolute increases in gross domestic product (GDP) in every region of the world over this period. In South Asia, combined GDP in 2014 was more than five times what it was in 1985, it said.
The study showed that just 57 billionaires in India now have same wealth (USD 216 billion) as that of the bottom 70 per cent population of the country.
Globally, just 8 billionaires have the same amount of wealth as the poorest 50 per cent of the world population.
In the US, by contrast, billionaires have frequently chosen to cash out of their businesses, and their wealth has not lasted so long.

Mahinda  cannot  make another comeback : Ashok Abeysinghe
	
The increase in fines for seven traffic offences created much hullabaloo last month which resulted in an islandwide public transport strike. Although numerous fines are being charged, disciplined driving and road safety still remain unheard of and unattended resulting in numerous fatal road accidents every day. In a candid interview with the Daily Mirror, Deputy Minister of Transport and Civil Aviation, Ashok Abeysinghe spoke about how the increase in fines would be implemented, losses that occurred during the previous regime and how the present government is battling with loans and covering other expenses.
"Many of these offences are intentional. People do not just drink, they think before consuming hard liquor. It is the same when you overtake from the left side without a licence. "
"Many three-wheeler drivers are very young and they are made to feel it as a potential career. Because of this, there is a dearth in skilled labour and it would be an added national issue in future."
"the Hambantota port was built with a staggering Rs. 144 billion. But its daily income is Rs.18 million while the expenditure rounds up to Rs. 26 million. Making matters worse, the monthly debt instalment is Rs. 85 million."

Q There was much speculation regarding the increase in fines. Do you think they would reduce accidents as expected
There are 30 types of fines and offences in Sri Lanka. Drunk driving, driving without a licence, driving without insurance, allowing a a person to drive without a driving licence, high speed, overtaking from the left and driving through closed rail gates were identified as serious offences which had to be heavily fined. Those who attended the discussion said it was right to fine people at least Rs.50,000 for such offences, excluding high speed and overtaking from the left side. We do not intend to reduce this limit since we hope to see a reduction in motor accidents in the coming year. As of last year, 2900 people have been killed as a result of accidents that had happened in Sri Lanka. At a conference which I participated last year addressing motor traffic regulations, it was said that close to 1.3 million people die every year due to motor accidents while another 50 million become disabled. In Sri Lanka, 7 people are killed in a day and close to 20-25 people become disabled. In most countries, fines have been increased to minimise accidents and they have been successful in their attempts. 
There was a request to revise the fine for high speed and overtaking from the left side and which are still at discussion level. To begin with, we dont have specified speed limits on the roads and therefore its not practical to impose a fine for high speed. On the other hand, if vehicles travel on the right side they all should travel on the right. But in our case, there is no space for vehicles to ply from the left. Therefore we are looking into this matter as well. But it would take another 6 months for these fines to be implemented. 
Q What about the less grave or minor offences such as parking at unauthorized parking lots or making U-turns How would fines be imposed on them
For these offences, normal fines will be charged but there again the fine which was once Rs.20 would now be Rs.100 and so on. Many of these offences are intentional. People do not just drink, they think before consuming hard liquor. It is the same when you overtake from the left side or drive without a licence. We are trying to convert Sri Lanka into disciplined nation by imposing these fines. 
Q Shouldnt motorcyclists and three-wheeler drivers be given adequate education or training when using the roads
There are close to 3.4 million motorcycles and 1.2 million trishaws in Sri Lanka. It had reached such a level that we could not bear this capacity any more. Therefore, when a person buys a new three-wheeler, only 25% of the lease will be allowed, and for a second hand one 75% will be given. Many three-wheeler drivers are very young and they are made to feel it as a potential career. Because of this, there is a dearth in skilled labour and it would be an added national issue in future. We have informed the National Council for Road Safety to implement a programme where every three-wheeler should have the drivers identification details such as the drivers photo and other details. In addition to that it should also be mentioned whether it is a metered taxi or a normal one. Then the passengers would know everything about the three-wheeler and its driver. Another problem is, there are approximately 45,000 registered school vans roaming around the streets in the country. Another 25,000 unregistered vans are also in the business. We have informed the Council regarding these school vans as well. 
Q USD 300 million has been allocated for the electric train project. Isnt it better if the existing railway service is given a revamp first, increase salaries of its staff, give an ear to their grievances etc.
When looking at the debt burden we have, how could we increase salaries We are a small country and we cannot operate bullet trains. Still we are at a developing stage and we dont earn enough money to spend. From the 196 countries in the world, every one person among 350 people is a government servant. In Sri Lanka the ratio is 15 : 1. This is why we still do not see any progress. In order to pay their salaries, we need Rs.700 billion. There are approximately 565,000 pensioners and another Rs.150 billion should be allocated for their benefits. In addition to that, we also have to cover Samurdhi and fertilizer subsidies which require another Rs. 400 billion. Our debt interest is Rs. 666 billion and the instalment is Rs. 800 billion which sums up to approximately Rs. 2,000 billion. But we earn only Rs. 1,600 billion which makes it a difficult task to cover up these expenses. 

"In Sri Lanka, 7 people are killed in a day and close to 20-25 people become disabled. In most countries, fines have been increased to minimise accidents and they have been successful in their attempts"
Q Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa blames the incumbent government for calling the Mattala Airport a white elephant. After the yahapalana government came in to power, how are the Mattala airport and the Hambantota port being handled
The best example is that during the recent flight cancellation schedule due to the on-going construction, we requested flights to use the Mattala airport. But no airline was willing to do so due its limited facilities except for four SriLankan flights that land four days a week. The present income that the Mattala airport generates is Rs. 3 million while the expenditure is Rs. 250 million. For a month, the repayment of loan is Rs. 300 million, which is Rs. 3.6 billion a year, which is covered by the revenue generated by the Katunayake Airport. As of now, there is only one flight that lands there and that too had some issues recently. We are trying to include the airport as a Private Public Partnership (PPP) in order to develop its business. On the other hand, the Hambantota port was built with a staggering Rs. 144 billion. But its daily income is Rs.18 million while the expenditure rounds up to Rs. 26 million. Making matters worse, the monthly debt instalment is Rs. 85 million. So we dont have money for its development purposes. If the previous regime wanted a port, they could have brought down an investor, explained the system and allowed them to do the needful. Since there is no way that we could cover up its expenses, we will be forging ahead as a Public-Private Partnership for Rs. 1.2 billion, so that the profits would be shared at 80: 20 ratio. When we are trying to make progress, there are many obstacles but we will move forward. 
Q The COPE report took the Central Bank Bond issue on a serious note. What is the current status of this so-called scam
During the previous regime, nobody knew about Bond. But today we see many people talking about it. When we make an announcement about the issuance of Bonds, the 16 primary dealers in the country would discuss what the interest could be. During that particular week we needed Rs. 20 billion but they only announced Rs. 1 billion at the auction. Yet, they have also asked the dealers how much they would claim if the figure is about Rs. 20 billion and this was proved with evidence in the COPE report. Perpetual Treasuries was established in 2012 and the former CB governors sister was a member of its Board of Directors. It was run by Arjuna Aloysius and his family. But during this time, Arjuna Mahendran was not in the country and nobody knew he would be the next CB governor. Then in 2013, Arjuna Aloysius became Mahendrans son-in-law, and till then no one knew whether Mahendran would be on the Governors chair. The problem here was, that during that particular week, when Mahendran had inquired about the figure he was aware that Rs. 20 billion was collected but the Monetary Board had said that if they had taken it as a bulk, the interest rate would increase. When they have requested to take only Rs. 2.6 billion and he wanted to know the last 30 years Bond and its status. In turn he had requested the Monetary Board to take Rs.10 billion and Perpetual Treasuries Ltd. and required Rs. 5 billion out of that. So the suspicion arose in his request to have Rs. 10 billion and Rs. 5 billion could be given to Perpetual Treasuries. The COPE Committee had identified the scam and the report was submitted to the Auditor General for his approval and then it was sent to Parliament. 

"MR has also served this country but with a lot of corruption. Nobody wants him back and if he is brought back in to power, its like giving a licence to do something illegal"

Q But this committee which should be working independently is known as a highly politicized one. What are your views on this
Nobody can influence the COPE committee. During the previous regime the COPE committee chairman was one of their supporters but we have a member from the JVP. There is a mixed representation of members from different parties in its committee. We have to change the standing orders because there is no point in just discussing matters. We have requested the Speaker to allow us to take decisions and move in to a more practical way of solving issues that are in hand. 
Q Is the Yahapalana government moving in the right direction
The yahapalana government will definitely be in power till 2020. Two parties with different principles have gotten together to make a difference. We wanted to get together as one in order to take this country forward. MR has mentioned somewhere that he was going to topple the government in 2017 but he cannot make another comeback without an election. We have given a promise to the people. MR has also served this country but with a lot of corruption. Nobody wants him back and if he is brought back in to power, its like giving a licence to do something illegal.

MR refused to pawn SL to regain GSP+: GL
	
Former president Mahinda Rajapaksa had an opportunity of regaining the GSP+ facility during his tenure if he had agreed to the conditions laid down by the European Union (EU) at the risk of compromising the countrys sovereignty, SLPP Chairman G.L.Peiris claimed today.
He told a news briefing that Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe was only speaking a lot about GSP+ but not about the conditions laid down by the EU to grant this preferential tariff system again to Sri Lanka.
Government has to agree to 58 conditions which are disadvantages to the country and its sovereignty, such as the removal of the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA) and restructuring the military. We are in favour of Sri Lanka regaining this facility but opposed to selling our nation. Mr. Rajapaksa rejected a similar set of conditions, Mr. Peiris said.
He said regaining the GSP+ was not the issue but what mattered was the repercussions of regaining it.
We cannot pawn the country for the sake of economic growth. The Prime Minister cannot deny the fact that these conditions will impact on the country and the people adversely, Mr. Peiris said.
The Generalized Scheme of Preferences or GSP+ allows developing countries to pay less or are exempt from duty exports to EU-member countries while providing access to EU markets and contribute to their economic growth.
Sri Lanka lost this facility in 2010. Last year German Chancellor Angela Merkel assured President Maithripala Sirisena that the EU would re-consider offering the GSP+ facility based on the steps taken by him on re-establishing Human Rights, Labour Rights, Environmental Protection and Good Governance.

The executive officer of the Welisara Navy Hospital was remanded till January 26, by Colombo Fort Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne yesterday, in connection with the abduction and disappearance of two persons from Kotahena eight years ago.
The suspect is Lieutenant Commander Mapa Mudiyanselage Dhammika Anila Mapa. He had been attached to the Navy Intelligence Wing in 2009 when the incident occurred.
He was arrested by the CID under section 296 of the penal code.

Orient Finance to raise Rs.400mn via rights to strengthen capital base
	
Janashakthi group subsidiary, Orient Finance PLC, plans to raise up to Rs.400 million via a proposed rights issue to strengthen its Tier II capital, a disclosure filed with the Colombo Stock Exchange said.
The company has called an Extraordinary General Meeting on January 20 to obtain the shareholder consent to the proposed share issue.
However, Janashakthi PLC controls an 89.81 percent stake in the company with another 1.62 percent held by Dunamis Capital PLC, another Janashakthi group entity.
B G Investments Private Limited held another 3.15 percent stake being the second largest shareholder. 
The proposed rights issue is by way of preference shares redeemable in five years and each existing shareholder will receive one new share at an issue price of Rs.100 a share for every 37 existing ordinary shares held.
However, the shareholders have the option to subscribe for additional shares or renounce ones rights in favour of a third party, the company stated. 
As of September 30, 2016, the company had 148 million ordinary shares. The companys share is now trading around Rs.13.90. Generally the rights price is less than the market price per share but in this case the former is significantly higher than the trading value of the share.
This could be due to the fact that the rights are being issued by way of preference shares, which get precedence over ordinary shares in the case of a liquidation and receive a fixed dividend, hence less risky than an ordinary share.
The company said these preference shares would not be listed in the stock exchange.
The proceeds will be used for lending purposes.
As of September 30, 2016, Orient Finance had an equity capital base of Rs.2.38 billion.
The Central Bank this month announced its intentions to increase the minimum Tier I capital of licensed finance companies up to Rs.2.0 billion from the current Rs.400 million.
A formal directive to that effect is expected soon.
The regulatory minimum Tier I and Tier II capital adequacy ratios for licensed finance companies and licensed banks stand at 5 percent and 10 percent, respectively.
The liquidity ratios will also be raised.
Orient Finance has a total asset base of Rs.18.5 billion and a loans and receivable book of Rs.15.5 billion, which grew by little under Rs.2.0 billion during the 1H17. 
The company earned a net profit of Rs.1.06 a share, 63 percent lower from the same period last year as provisions for bad loans and costs surged.
The licensed finance companies could see higher regulatory supervision by the Central Bank while the industry could brace for tougher times ahead with tightened monetary conditions and the sector being also forced for consolidation.

PM criticizes Ports Authority lawyers: JO
	
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has criticised the lawyers appearing for the Ports Authority in the case filed in the High Court against the Hambantota lease agreement, MP Mahindananda Aluthgamage said today.
He told a media briefing organised by the joint opposition that Prime Minister had done so at a discussion held at Temple Trees on Sunday.
The MP said that the Attorney General, Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake, Development Strategies and International Trade Minister Malik Samarawickrama and Ports and Shipping Minister Arjuna Ranatunga had attended the discussion.
The Prime Minister has criticized Minister Ranatunga and the lawyers as they were against the Hambantota Port agreement and the acquiring of lands for the proposed Hambantota industrial zone. The lawyers had showed that the agreement was illegal and the Ports Authority should not authorise it, he said.
The MP said according to the sources, the lawyers had been warned to remain silent till the agreement was finalised.
While the subject minister has repeatedly said the country will lose some Rs.330 million if the government goes ahead with the agreement, the Prime Minister and the Finance Minister are trying to sign the agreement in secret, he added. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

The All Island Bakers Association (AIBA) today warned that prices of all bakery products except for bread would be increased within the next few days because of the increase in the price of ingredients.
The AIBA Chairman N.K. Jayawardane said ingredients such as margarine, palm oil, flour and sugar have gone up in price.
If the prices of ingredients continue to increase, the prices of the bakery products will also increase. However, we are still to take a final decision, he said and added that the government had increased the tax on margarine and palm oil. We have to pay about Rs.185 for a kilogram of margarine and Rs.120 for a litre of palm oil only as tax. We hope the government will intervene in reducing the taxes at least on essential ingredients, he said.(Darshana Sanjeewa)

## Title: Reconciliation Process in Sri Lanka The lessons and the choices of history

Reconciliation Process in Sri Lanka The lessons and the choices of history
	
The following is the speech made by Minister of Foreign Affairs Mangala Samaraweera at the Royal Institute of International Affairs, London on Wednesday January 11, 2017. Excerpts

The topic on which I speak- The Reconciliation Process in Sri Lanka- in fact holds special significance for us Sri Lankans this week. This is because the Cabinet of Ministers recently declared the week from January 8 to 14 as the National Integration and Reconciliation Week. This coincides with the completion of two years since the historic Presidential election of January 8th 2015, and this is the first occasion on which this annual National Integration and Reconciliation Week is being observed in my country. 
As one of the main features of this observance, on January 9 in schools and State institutions including in Parliament, the following Pledge for National Integration and Reconciliation was read out- resolving to work together, hand in hand, while respecting the richness of our diversity, to foster peace, understanding, mutual trust, and brotherhood; a new Sri Lanka united in its diversity. 
Several of my predecessors too have spoken here at the Chatham House. This includes the late Mr. Lakshman Kadirgamar who spoke at length here, in 1998, about the danger faced at the time by our nation, and democratic societies everywhere, from terrorism. 
Almost twenty years later, I feel fortunate to be here representing a country where the guns and the bombs have finally fallen silent. 

"As an important measure to prevent non-recurrence of conflict, the Parliament, last year, unanimously adopted a Resolution for the Parliament to sit as a Constitutional Assembly to draft a new Constitution that would, among other provisions. "
Although the violence ended in May 2009, the healing of wounds of over two decades of conflict, achieving reconciliation and national integration, catching up on economic progress and development that eluded us due to conflict, and ensuring non-recurrence, remain challenging tasks for our Nation. Similarly, the tasks of improving governance, institutions, rule of law, and putting in place necessary measures to strengthen, promote and protect individual rights; while ensuring the dignity of all and building a truly national identity while preserving our pluralistic society  remain work in progress. 
This week, 2 years ago on the 8th of January, the people of Sri Lanka courageously turned out to vote across the country to end authoritarianism, corruption and the politics of hate; they voted for a new democratic Sri Lanka where democracy, reconciliation, the rule of law and sustainable development would flourish. 
This courageous decision by the people of Sri Lanka enabled us, for the first time in our countrys history, to form a Government of National Unity, bringing together, the two main political parties  the Sri Lanka Freedom Party headed by President Maithripala Sirisena, and the United National Party headed by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe. 
Having achieved a significant number of promises set out in the 100 Day Work Programme of the Government, the most significant being the repeal of the 18th Amendment to the Constitution, and the adoption of the 19thAmendment, fresh Parliamentary elections were called in August 2015. 
The 19th Amendment, as mostof you I am sure are aware, 
	Re-introduced the two-term limit of the Presidency, 
	
	
	Reduced the term of the Presidency from 6 to 5 years, 
	
	
	Established a Constitutional Council, 
	
	
	Restored Independent Commissions, 
	
	
	Recognised the Right to Information as a fundamental right, and 
	
	
	Recognised the Promotion of National Reconciliation and Integration as duties of the President. 
	
The Government also had in its hands, the task of restoring Sri Lankas relations with the outside world, and restoring lost credibility. The Government, since January 2015, therefore, started reaching out to the international community, re-engaging with governments and international organisations. 
The power of Parliament has been strengthened. Oversight Committees have been set up with Opposition members chairing several key Committees. 
The Right to Information Act, which was enacted by Parliament last year is now in the process of being operational. 
In two years Sri Lanka has made considerable strides from soft-authoritarianism towards consolidating a rights-based democracy with deeply entrenched institutions and values. 
We are convinced and we recognize clearly, that societies that avoid looking at the past, fail to build sustainable peace. Sri Lanka has suffered conflict several times both in the South and in the North. There is hardly anyone in Sri Lanka who can claim to not having been affected by conflict. We know that traumatic memories dont simply vanish and we have learned, through experience since Independence, that grievances that are left unaddressed, can go on for generations, becoming entrenched, and holding the risk of descending into cycles of violence. 
It is these realizations that cry out to us that our nation will never be able to achieve the full socio-economic development potential that our nation can reach, and our citizens are so deserving of, if we fail to address grievances, that risk plunging our nation into conflict once again, that led us to co-sponsor the Resolution that we worked on with members of the Human Rights Council in October 2015. The content of the Resolution is based on commitments that we ourselves as a Government, made to our people, and proposals that we presented to the Council based on the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission Report, the Paranagama Commission Report and advice of our experts. 
As the President said in his Independence Day speech in February last year, Sri Lanka is committed to the implementation of that resolution so that we as a country can deal with the past honestly and truthfully, accept that past, put it behind us, and then move forward to build our Sri Lankan nation anew. 

"This week, 2 years ago on the 8th of January, the people of Sri Lanka courageously turned out to vote across the country to end authoritarianism, corruption and the politics of hate; they voted for a new democratic Sri Lanka"

The set of actions that the Government has identified to deal with the past in a comprehensive manner, addressing the grievances of all victims, include truth seeking, justice, reparation and measures for guaranteeing non-recurrence. As a first step, we have enacted legislation to set up an Office on Missing Persons. Now that the Consultation Task Force set up to seek the views of the public has just handed over its Report to the Government on the 3rd of January, the relevant experts of Government, in an exercise coordinated by the Secretariat that has been set up to Coordinate the Reconciliation Mechanisms will be studying the Report and finalizing the designing of a Truth-Seeking Commission and a Reparations Office. 
As some of you may be aware there are divergent views even within the government in respect of the participation of foreign judges in the proposed judicial mechanism. 
However, despite this divergence of opinions, there is a clear consensus across the board on the need of an independent and credible domestic mechanism as promised by the manifesto of President Maithripala Sirisena. As a democratic and sovereign government, we will work out the architecture of such a mechanism in consultation with all the stake-holders. 
Among the various multiple tasks we have undertaken, is the drafting through a consultative and inclusive process, of a National Human Rights Action Plan for the next five years beginning from this year (2017-2021).This draft Action Plan is currently before the Cabinet. 
As you are aware, Missing Persons is a phenomenon that has plagued Sri Lanka for long years. Apart from steps being taken to set up the permanent Office on Missing Persons, we have also become parties to the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance. The draft enabling legislation to give effect to the provisions of the Convention is also presently before the Cabinet. 

As you are aware, one of the first steps taken by the National Unity Government in January 2015 itself was to restore civilian administration in the North and the East of the country. We have also taken a series of symbolic steps to establish equality of all citizens, such as singing the National Anthem in both Sinhala and Tamil; promising the people to ensure that we dont allow our country to plunge into conflict and the shedding of blood of our citizens by adopting a Declaration of Peace on Independence Day in February 2015; and observing the National Integration and Reconciliation Week annually, beginning from this week. 
As an important measure to prevent non-recurrence of conflict, the Parliament, last year, unanimously adopted a Resolution for the Parliament to sit as a Constitutional Assembly to draft a new Constitution that would, among other provisions. 
Much of the preparatory work for the new constitution has now been completed. Wide-ranging public consultations were conducted for the first time in Sri Lankas constitutional history; much study, reflection and negotiation was undertaken to arrive at consensus at the six sub-committees set up and final negotiations on a draft are currently underway. 
On the developmental front, a solid foundation for economic growth, job creation and broad-based prosperity is being laid. First, the government is dealing with the white elephant economy it inherited: debt, fiscal pressures and wasteful expenditure were serious problems that have now been stabilized. 

"As the President said in his Independence Day speech in February last year, Sri Lanka is committed to the implementation of that resolution so that we as a country can deal with the past honestly and truthfully, accept that past, put it behind us, and then move forward to build our Sri Lankan nation anew"

The lessons and the choices of our history are clear to us today. We have a choice between impunity, conflict, corruption, extremism and poverty, or the rule of law, accountability, equality, multiculturalism, openness and trade. We have a choice between conflict and poverty, versus peace and prosperity. 
The statement issued in Brussels earlier today by the European Commission on granting the GSP+ concession to Sri Lanka is yet another indicator of Sri Lanka moving along the right track. 
Two years since the 8th of January in 2015, the National Unity Government remains steadfast in its determination to achieve the objectives it set out to achieve for our country. We have succeeded against far greater odds and more powerful foes. The challenges that we have before us are not easy ones. But determination and unity, and courage and moral fortitude drive us to embrace tough choices and endure hardship to break the cycle of missed opportunities and disappointments to achieve for our people, especially our future generations, the prosperous and peaceful land that they so deserve. We are determined to ensure our success. 
That is why I say to the cynics again that there will be no U-Turn despite some detours from time to time. 
Breaking from the past, we will confine those who spin webs from the threads of ignorance to the dust-bin of history; finally put prejudice, ignorance, mediocrity and opportunism behind us once and for all, and build a truly united, democratic, multi-cultural and prosperous Sri Lanka where peace, justice, equality, dignity and freedom for all, prevail.  

"We are convinced and we recognize clearly, that societies that avoid looking at the past, fail to build sustainable peace. Sri Lanka has suffered conflict several times both in the South and in the North."

At least seven civilians were killed when their truck hit a roadside bomb explosion in eastern Afghanistan (Courtesy Pakistan Today). 


JALALABAD AFP Jan15, 2017- At least seven civilians, including a woman and three children, were killed when their truck hit a roadside bomb in eastern Afghanistan on Sunday, officials said. 
The villagers were travelling from Pacheer Agam district to a nearby village in Nangarhar province, Hijratullah Rahmani district governor of Pacheer Agam told AFP. 
Unfortunately, in the blast, seven civilians, including a woman and three children were killed and one wounded, he said. 
No one claimed responsibility, but the interior ministry in a statement blamed enemies of peace and stability, a term Afghan officials use to refer to Taliban. 
Nangarhar is also home to Islamic State group fighters, who are trying to expand their presence in Afghanistan by winning over sympathizers, recruiting followers and challenging the Taliban on their own turf.

Why I stand for a Secular Sri Lanka
	
It is a clinging paradox that many vicious wars and other acts of cruelty have been perpetrated by religious bigots justified by claims of religious conviction. The Crusades and the current Islamic conflicts are based on religious grounds. This is while all religions preach compassion and humanity. 
While the goal is the same, the inspirations differ. For the theistic religions, it is a duty towards a Creator God. For Christians, Jesus Christ, the Son of God, preached a message of kindness and compassion towards fellow beings. Hindus saw it as an offering to an Athman, which was breathed into ones Soul and expected back in an improved form. Islam enjoins its adherents to follow the message preached by the Prophet as the Messenger of Allah. Buddhists are to follow the Dhamma as a means to self-improvement. 

"In our society, instead of appreciating this commonality, we seek to compartmentalize - a sure recipe for conflict"

Without exception, all of them call for the practice of kindness and compassion. 
In our society, instead of appreciating this commonality, we seek to compartmentalize - a sure recipe for conflict. The path we have followed is an attempt to cater to individual groups in a richly diverse nation. The result has been failure. It has mainly resulted in a ridiculous creation of such aberrations as Ministries for Christian, Hindu, Buddhist and Muslim Affairs. Assuming that these are created with genuine motives and not designed to create rewards with sinecures and fat benefits, the result has been of nil benefit. For what are Christian, Hindu, Buddhist or Muslim Affairs or interests that are diverse, distinct and different enough to surpass human interests 
Pain, sorrow, injustice and prejudice are as hurtful to all, irrespective of the label we happen to carry. Have we not just emerged from a terrible conflict portrayed however unjustly, by some prejudiced elements as a battle between a Sinhala Buddhist Army and a dispossessed Hindu Minority Is it not bizarre, among other examples, that the wife of a Minister for Christian Affairs was convicted of the murder of her husbands mistress 
Is this what a sublime faith deserves Much fuss is made of the need or otherwise of a provision in the proposed Constitution to include provision for Buddhism to be accorded a special place. I believe this is unnecessary and a needless provocation of followers of minority religions. Despite its vociferous supporters, I believe it to be wrong. 

If five hundred years of domination by foreign forces, evangelical and demonstrably hostile to the then established religions failed to inflict serious injury, what reason is there to fear our own people Will someone please explain why in a professed Buddhist nation, we have not succeeded in stopping the cruel and coarse practice of slaughtering cattle by slitting their throats and bleeding them to death in the insensitive view of victims awaiting their turn Have we attempted to explain that in modern times, the availability of rapid transport and the accessibility of refrigeration meet the need to ensure bleeding as a means of reducing spoilage This could well have prompted the need for what today seems a supremely cruel practice.
What has the Ministry of Buddha Sasana or for that matter, those for Christian, Hindu and Muslim Affairs done to really justify their existence and national outlay Merely cataloguing, listing and data-gathering and engagement with ritualistic formalities is just not significant. The Buddha preached, as also the leaders of other religions, that discrimination of any kind was unwholesome. Where then do the Nikayas stand 
Have the Venerable Mahanayakas views on this matter been sought If not, of what use are the costly processions of sundry worthies bearing unnecessary fruit baskets and Atapirikaras Whom are they bluffing Of course some customs and rituals need to be preserved. But obsession with them distorts and devalues all that the great philosophies sought to teach. 

"Looking around us towards nations that are secular and those that are driven by various faiths, the evidence is overwhelming that Sri Lanka is best served by being secular - not necessarily by inclusion in any document, but in practice"

To end on a personal note to clear the air, I was born to traditional Buddhist parents, educated in a Christian school and count among my friends devout Christian, Hindu and Moslem adherents. They, one and all, are decent, tolerant and fine persons. I endeavour to follow the Dhamma of the Buddha, endeavouring to observe the Five Precepts of abstaining from killing, stealing, adultery, lying and partaking of liquor to the extent of intoxication. All these, one may notice, have to do with disciplined conduct, avoiding harm or pain to others. 
I venture to suggest that if all Buddhists would strive as a minimum, to observe the Five Noble Precepts, it may contribute much more than vociferous clamouring for Constitutional or other bureaucratic provisions, towards making Sri Lanka a better place for all of us. 
Looking around us towards nations that are secular and those that are driven by various faiths, the evidence is overwhelming that Sri Lanka is best served by being secular - not necessarily by inclusion in any document, but in practice.

Youth not interested in Politics, Parliament: EC
	
The country's youth between the ages 16 to 30 years are not in favour of the present election system, casting of votes, registering for votes and the Parliament, Elections Commissioner Mahinda Deshapriya to the media at the Elections Secretariat today.
Having interviewed several youth, he said the Elections Secretariat figured out that the youth did not care about politics in the country.
There was an interest created regarding the Provincial Council elections in the Eastern, North Central and Sabaragamuwa in 2012. During the two elections held in the 2015 the interest peaked. But now the youths say they are not interested in Parliament or the elections, he said.
Nowadays most of the youth have no idea of going to voting centres, he said.
The main responsibility of the Elections Commission was to register all citizens eligible for voting other than holding polls. (Chaturanga Pradeep)
