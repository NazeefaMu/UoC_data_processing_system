<U+200B>Australia defends sending back of Sri Lankans
	
	The Australian Federal Government has defended sending four men back to Sri Lanka this month after intercepting their boat off the Cocos Islands, describing it as a people smuggling venture.
Immigration Minister Peter Dutton said interviewers determined the men were not refugees, and their return to Sri Lanka sent a "very strong message to the people smugglers".
"The intelligence tells us that the people smugglers just haven't given up ... they will continue to peddle their evil trade," he said.
"These are organised criminal syndicates that are involved in trying to leverage money out of people to get them onto boats, but those people are wasting their money, they're wasting their time, and they're wasting their effort. They will not be coming to Australia. "
Each Sri Lankan was interviewed on board the border protection boat by trained officers supported by independent qualified interpreters, Mr Dutton said.
The next day they were transferred at sea to Sri Lankan authorities.
The United Nations refugee agency has expressed deep concern about interception at sea, and the removal of people seeking Australia's protection.
But Mr Dutton said the Australian Government was "acting well and truly within not only our domestic but our international law obligations".
"We are very happy that we are acting in a responsible way," he said.
The Government recently confirmed that 15 boats carrying more than 400 people had been turned back under Operation Sovereign Borders.
'Implausible on-water screening process is legitimate'
Hugh de Kretser from the Human Rights Law Centre argued the screening process used was not safe.
"Only two out of over 400 people have been found to have a potential refugee claim yet historically we know that 90 per cent of boat arrivals on Australian shores will be found to be refugee," he said.
"It is simply implausible that this on-water screening process is a legitimate one.
"There are huge risks involved in it. People need to be brought to Australia and properly processed on land with access to proper legal advice."
Trevor Grant from the Tamil Refugee Council called it a shameful process.
"Two asylum seekers from Sri Lanka, who were returned by the Australian Government under this process, they're now living in Nepal," he said.
"They said that they were given a satellite phone by a customs and border protection [officer] while they were on the boat during their so-called interview.
"They said they couldn't hear the person on the other end of the line properly. In such circumstances it's ridiculous to believe that they could."
He said they risk being returned to persecution.
Mr Dutton said he was confident Sri Lankan authorities would "act in a way that is responsible" which "most Australians would see ... as a fair deal".
"We've found a very credible partner in Sri Lanka and there's obviously been a long-standing co-operation between our two countries," he said.
"With the new administration in Sri Lanka, I think they've demonstrated to be very effective in staring down what is a problem for all of us, that is people leaving by boats."
"We have arrangements and undertakings with the Sri Lankan Government and that has been exercised in relation to this matter."
Mr Dutton said he was "absolutely confident people [would] be dealt with according to Sri Lankan law".
"We are dealing with a very credible administration in Sri Lanka and we have a lot of faith in the discussions that we have with them," he said.
"I'm not going into the details of the exact points that we've agreed on or the arrangements we have in place, but we're absolutely confident people will be dealt with according to Sri Lankan law and we have satisfied ourselves that we do not owe these people a migration outcome."(ABC)

Golden Key depositors hit back at Kotelawala
	
While disputing the information provided by Ceylinco Group?s founding Chairman Lalith Kotelawala, the Golden Key Depositors Association (GKDA) members maintained that the funds deposited in the Golden Key Credit Card Co. Ltd and five other companies in the Ceylinco group were defrauded.
They also claimed that Dr. Kotelawala is evading the settlement of the money by abusing the Court process.
GKDA President Dushyanthi Hapugoda told a news conference that Dr. Kotelawala has violated his bail conditions by launching Tripna Travels and Tours Ltd., a subsidiary of Ceylinco and urged that he be arrested for doing so.
?Everything he said at that interview is a lie. Out of the 26 billion rupees he defrauded, we can?t even find 500 million rupees because he has various methods of avoiding payment. When you take the entire amount he defrauded into account it?s a staggering 45 billion rupees. As claimed by him it is also a complete lie that all his assets were seized by the then Government,? Ms. Hapugoda charged.
?All the ?black money? he refers to in Golden Key is the hard earned money of innocent people. He says he can?t remember anything, but there are several memo?s to Khavan Perera with his signature that might refresh his memory.?
She also demanded the immediate arrest of his wife Sicille Kotelawala against whom there were High Court and Interpol arrest warrants and pointed out that the then Government had done nothing to ensure her arrest.
?There are High Court and Interpol warrants for Sicille Kotelawala?s arrest, but I have found a statement issued by John Rankin in February 2013 stating that Britain has not received any request for extradition from the Sri Lankan government. So as a result she is staying in luxury apartments there,? Ms. Hapugoda said. (Jehan Gunasekara)Pix by Kushan Pathiraja

How did Yoshitha go abroad amid probe: JVP
	
The Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) today criticised the decision to allow former President?s son Lieutenant Yoshitha Rajapaksa to leave the country when there was an ongoing investigation into allegations made against him.
JVP MP Vijitha Herath said the defence secretary had assured they would appoint a committee to look into the privileges afforded to Mr. Rajapaksa.
?We complained that Yoshitha Rajapaksa had given special privileges during the previous government. But in the wake of all these allegations and ongoing investigations, the navy has granted him three months? leave. Neither has he been summoned by the committee probing the allegations,? he told a news conference.
Mr. Herath said his party was displeased over the slow progress of investigation into LTTE?s former arms procurer Kumaran Pathmanathan alias KP and those who were alleged to have committed several acts of bribery and corruption. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Oppn. asks Mangala to explain letter to UNHRC
	
	The main opposition yesterday sought clarifications in Parliament, regarding the communication by Foreign Minister Mangala Samaraweera to the UNHRC and on action to be taken locally and internationally regarding the resolutions adopted by the Northern Provincial Council (NPC) calling for an international inquiry into allegations of war crimes in Sri Lanka.
	Opposition Leader Nimal Siripala de Silva, in his question raised under Standing Order 23/2 , said United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein had announced that the report of his investigative committee? on Sri Lanka would be deferred till September.
	Mr. de Silva said the UN High Commissioner had acted in this regard in response to a request by the government of Sri Lanka. Also, he said Foreign Affairs Minister Mangala Samaraweera, in his communication with the UN High Commissioner, had pledged to bring about different reforms including the meting out of justice regarding war crime allegations, during the 100-day programme of the new government.
	Against this backdrop, he said the NPC had passed a resolution calling for an international probe. Alongside, he said, the Tamil Diaspora had cited the deferral of report on Sri Lanka as inappropriate at this hour.
	Therefore, he asked whether the Minister asked for the deferral of this report, and promised to ensure justice regarding war crime allegations through a mechanism. Also, he asked whether the Minister would submit documents of his correspondence with the UN system in this regard.
	He also asked what action would be taken by the new government to safeguard the image of Sri Lanka in the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC).
	Chief Government Whip Gayantha Karunatilake said the subject minister would respond on the matter today. (Kelum Bandara and Yohan Perera)

My car taken away by police says Raththaran
	
The Southern Provincial Councillor, Chrisantha Pushpakumara, alias Raththaran, had lodged a complaint claiming that his car had been taken away by the Kurunegala Police, who seemed to be under the impression that it belonged to the Presidential Secretariat after he left it at a garage in Kurunegala to be repaired.
He said that he had taken his car to a garage in Kurunegala because vehicle parts were readily available there. When he went back to the garage, he had been informed by the garage owner that ten vehicles, including his car, had been taken away by the police.
Pushpakumara complained that his car had been taken away without even checking with the Department of Motor Vehicles about the owner of the vehicle although he was using it with its original number plates and said that this vehicle, a Toyota Hilux cab, was his private vehicle which he had obtained on lease from a leasing company.
He was going to complain about this matter to the Police Head Quarters in Colombo. (Amila Madushanka)

SL paid 85 mn to US Company for DPL work
	
The Sri Lankan Embassy in the United States paid Rs. 85 million to a company named ' Patton Boggs'? within a period of three years to carry out various activities on behalf of the government of Sri Lanka though they could have been done easily by diplomatic officers, Parliament was informed yesterday.
The Foreign Affairs Ministry of the new government revealed such details to the House in response to a question by JVP leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake.? According to the answer tabled in the House, this company had been assigned to cultivate allies in Congress for Sri Lanka, and to prevent any bills or resolutions coming up against the country at the Congress.
It had also been hired to help get the 2010 travel advisory on Sri Lanka lifted, and get the country off the Trafficking in Persons List. It had been contracted to organize a US business delegation to Sri Lanka.
The cultivation of genuine allies within the US congress for Sri Lanka, organising official delegations of US congressmen visiting Sri Lanka, the prevention of bills and resolutions on Sri Lanka, conducting negotiations on behalf of the mission to get the US State Department to lift the travel advisory were cited as the benefits derived from hiring this company.
However, Foreign Affairs Minister Mangala Samaraweera has said in his answer that such activities could have been carried out by diplomatic officers as such responsibilities came under their purview.
In 2010, Rs.35 million had been paid to this company. Rs.46 million had been paid in 2011 and Rs.12 million in 2012. (Kelum Bandara and Yohan Perera)
