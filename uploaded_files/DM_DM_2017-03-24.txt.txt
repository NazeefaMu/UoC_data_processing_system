Armed man held for driving at crowd in Belgium
	

ANTWERP AFP March23, 2017 - Belgian security forces arrested a French national Thursday after he tried to drive into a crowd of shoppers at high speed in the port city of Antwerp, officials said. 
Authorities found a rifle and bladed weapons in the car after the 39-year-old man tried to flee and was detained in the northern city, prosecutors said. 
The prosecutors office said he was driving at very high speed and that at different times pedestrians were placed in danger. Different arms were found in the boot, bladed weapons, a pump-action rifle and a container of as yet unidentified liquid, the prosecutor said in a statement.

The incident was the third in a week in the European Union after attacks at Orly airport in Paris and London, and came a day after the first anniversary of the Brussels suicide bombings that killed 32 people. 
A man in camouflage was taken away. Images on social media showed investigators searching a burgundy-coloured vehicle near the bank of the Scheldt river. 
Meir is the main shopping street in Antwerps historic centre and is mostly pedestrianised. It is one of the countrys biggest shopping areas. The Antwerp incident will put Europe further on edge after the attack on the British parliament killed three people plus the attacker

Astrology The science that unlocks human potential
	

By Sandagomi
Astrology is the science that deals with the influence of celestial bodies on man and his environment. It represents the vast body of knowledge gathered over ages through the study of regular movements of the Sun, the Moon and the other planets in our Solar system and their influences upon man in particular. 
In Sanskrit Astrology is called Jyotisha which means the Light of Knowledge. The English term Astrology is derived from the combination of Latin terms Aster (star) and Logos, which means reason or logic.
Astrology, the most ancient of all sciences developed into the status of a sublime body of knowledge providing an invaluable guide for man to discover his potential as a human being and to foresee his future in life, several thousand years before the birth of The Buddha.

Astrology in ancient civilizations
Although Astrology has been nurtured over ages and preserved to date as a vast body of knowledge in India, it has not been established yet that it is the original home of the science. For historians have uncovered evidence that Astrology had flourished as a well-developed science in ancient civilizations in Greece, Sumer, Babylon, Mesopotamia and Egypt. Great sages in these civilizations had acquired the knowledge relating to the influence of planets (Sun and Moon included) through empirical studies.
However, in India, the Rishis who lived in Himalayas appear to have imparted the principles relating to the relationship between planets and man and terrestrial phenomena that form the core of Vedic Astrology from the knowledge they had acquired through psychic powers. For example, Maha Rishi Parasara who lived about 5000 ago before the advent of Kali Yuga had propounded Astrological principles which later formed the bedrock of the science.
Even celebrated authors and commentators like Varahamihira, Bhattopala and Venkatesa who greatly enriched the science of Astrology had based their writings on the principles enunciated by Parasara.
It is believed that the Maha Rishis in ancient India had gained much more knowledge about the cosmos with their extra sensory perception or psychic powers than what scientists had acquired in recent times with the aid of highly developed modern equipment.

Ethereal power
Great Indian Astrologer Dr. B.V.Raman says in his celebrated work, Hindu Predictive Astrology: Astrology is the science that comprises foretelling of the regular movements of the planets, fortunes and misfortunes of men, fates of empires and kingdoms, inundations, earthquakes, plagues, volcano eruptions, pestilences, and other incidents relating to terrestrial phenomena.
According to Dr. Raman, a certain ethereal power derived from nature pervades the entire universe and the earth we inhabit is too subject to this mysterious and subtle power. The Sun, the Moon and the other planets are really agents carrying out the inexorable power.
Great men in human history like Dante, Pythagoras, Kepler, Bacon, and Democritus are said to have mastered Astrology.

The two main objectives
By acquiring a thorough knowledge of the influence of the planets on man, one would be able to correctly prognosticate the mental and physical qualities of any person and the fortunes and misfortunes that are in store for him, says Dr. Raman.
By foreseeing the future, one can become forearmed to cope with adversity and take timely action to ward off evil effects produced by planets. On the other hand, discovering ones potentialities would give one motivation and inspiration to realize them. This would give one a sense of direction in life.

4,000 civilians are trapped in West Mosul
	
GENEVA REUTERS March 23 - About 400,000 Iraqi civilians are trapped in the Islamic State-held Old City of western Mosul, short of food and basic needs as the battle between the militants and government forces rages around them, the United Nations refugee agency said on Thursday.

Many fear fleeing because of Islamic State snipers and landmines. But 157,000 have reached a reception and transit centre outside Mosul since the government offensive on the citys west side began a month ago, said Bruno Geddo, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) representative in Iraq. 
The worst is yet to come because 400,000 people trapped in the Old City in that situation of panic and penury may inevitably lead to the cork-popping somewhere, sometime, presenting us with a fresh outflow of large-scale proportions, he said.  Fighting in the past week has focused on the Old City, with government forces reaching as close as 500 metres to the al-Nuri Mosque, from where Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi declared a caliphate spanning parts of Iraq and Syria in July 2014.
 The hardline militants are now on the back foot, with their stronghold in Syria also under attack. But they still hold an estimated 40 percent of western Mosul and the campaign to recapture it could yet take weeks.

COPE summons SPC top officials
	
The Committee on Public Enterprises (COPE) in Parliament has summoned top officials of the State Pharmaceuticals Corporation (SPC) over the alleged financial fraud said to have taken place when importing a cancer vaccine.
A member of the committee who wished to remain anonymous said the SPC officials were summoned before COPE on April 6 over their alleged involvement in importing the vaccine Taxacad locally known as Hearticad.
Speaking to Daily Mirror, Chairman of the SPC Mr. Sarath Liyanage confirmed that COPE had summoned them. However, he said it was only to question them regarding the 2014 SPC Annual report. He said it was not unusual, as COPE had the right to do so and that it was only a normal check on another Corporation.
Recently the joint opposition revealed that malpractices had taken place when importing Hearticad- a breast cancer vaccine, and accused Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne and top officials of the SPC of being involved in the racket.
The JO had lodged a complaint with the Bribery Commission on March 01 stating that the Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne committed a crime by importing Rs.1, 500 million worth of vaccines which were detrimental to the health of cancer patients and putting their lives at risk.

Dengue in SL could be part of Asian health crisis: PM
	
The spread of dengue in Sri Lanka could be a part of the health crisis which currently prevails in the Asian region, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe told Parliament yesterday.
Responding to a question raised by the Joint Opposition Parliamentary Group leader Dinesh Gunawardena in the House, the prime minister said the spread of dengue in Sri Lanka and the spread of other diseases in other countries in Asia were parts of one health crisis in the region.
"Diseases such as fever and even bird flu are spreading in Asia, and millions of poultry are being destroyed in South Korea today. And the spread of diseases in Sri Lanka may be a part of this crisis, he said.
He said the government had focused on the spread of dengue in Sri Lanka and was doing its utmost to control it.
Minister Rauff Hakeem, who joined in the cross talk, said nearly 800 members of the security forces had been deployed to prevent the spread of disease.
Mr. Gunawardena asked what steps the government had taken to control dengue. He said the government should have accurate figures on the number of people who had died of dengue this year and on how many had been hospitalised.
He said the cause of death had been given as fever in some cases, although the patients might have died of dengue.
Leader of the House Lakshman Kiriella said dengue could have been prevented in Sri Lanka years ago if Sri Lanka had taken the same precautions that Cuba had taken to curb the disease. (Yohan Perera and Ajith Siriwardana)

Fetishist caught stealing underwear
	
Two shopkeepers in a certain town had shops opposite each other on the main road of the town.
They could see each other while conducting their business. One of them was residing with his family in a house adjoining his shop, while the other's family was living elsewhere.
The first shopkeeper's family included a young woman bathed in the evening and hung out her clothes on a line in the garden.
The other shopkeeper had observed this, and at dusk he had surreptitiously crossed the road and stolen the womens panties. He had done this on more than one occasion.
The woman had complained to her family that her clothes were getting stolen. Her brother had then fixed a CCTV camera to catch the thief. The next day too her clothes had been taken; the CCTV footage was examined and the family was shocked to discover that the other shopkeeper was the thief.
An early morning call to the man had awakened him from his sleep and, in order to avoid the resulting scandal, he had left the area, leaving his business unattended. (Senaka Bandara and K M P Bandara)

Human hand trailblazer of human civilization
	
By A.S. Fernando
The human hand is a marvellous creation of nature, say anthropologists. Not without reason, for its adaptation to the requirements of life marks the beginning of human civilization.
The hand is the direct servant of the brain. Markings on the hand reveal not only the workings of the brain, but also the general characteristics, mental peculiarities, capabilities and feelings of its owner. Above all, these markings signify what is in store for him in the future, say expert palmists.
Palmistry is the art of telling the characteristics of a person and important happenings in his life by examining the lines and other marks on the palm.

Hand tells everything
To the trained reader, the hand reveals not only the character, talents and proclivities of the subject but also the health, sickness, and important incidents in his life and also the most suitable career to be followed by him, says the celebrated writer on palmistry who goes by the pseudonym Psychos, in his work, The new Guide to Palmistry.

Two parts of Palmistry
Palmistry, according to Psychos is divided into two parts, namely Chirognomy or the science of judging the character from the shape of the hand and the fingers and Chiromancy, the science of reading the actions and habits of the past, present and the future events from the formation of the palm and the lines marked on it.
Hindu palmists treat palmistry as a branch of Astrology. As regards the other branches of Astrology, the date and time of the birth is vital for making a correct prediction. But in the case of palmistry, the date and time of birth of a person is not very important because his past, the present and the future lie hidden in the lines and marks on his hand.

Palmistry for prognosis
Palmistry has also made a great contribution towards the development of medical science in regard to diagnosis of disease. Because a disease person is afflicted with could be quickly and easily determined by observing the texture, lines and marks on his palm whereas it would take a day or two for a physician to ascertain the cause of a disease with the aid of medical equipment.
The science of palmistry is said to have been greatly developed in India in ancient times. Sages in ancient India, it is said, were able to give a reading covering very minute of the life of a person by examining the lines and marks on his palm.

Tiniest line tells a story
Expert palmists say that one should not base ones reading on one particular main line in isolation, because the prediction could go wrong without a study of other lines complementary to the main line.
An expert palmist would not overlook any line be it very tiny or barely discernible because he knows even the tiniest line would tell a story.

Right hand and left hand
Expert palmists would place special emphasis on the right hand, because it is the right hand people mostly work with. If a person uses his left hand for writing purposes and to perform other manual functions, the left palm should be given more importance.
The left hand of women dependent on their husbands or parents assumes more significance than the right one. However, in the case of women who earn their living by using their brain or brawn, their right hand should be considered more important than the left one.

Japanese nationalist claims cash from Abe as scandal deepens
	
TOKYO AFP March23, 2017-
A controversial nationalist educator said under oath Thursday he had received a donation for his school from Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe despite the premiers repeated denials in an intensifying political scandal that has gripped the country. 
The nationally televised testimony by Yasunori Kagoike came as his reportedly shady purchase of government land at a huge discount has dominated media coverage for weeks. 
Abe, whose high approval ratings have taken a hit, has repeatedly denied giving Kagoike money and on more than one occasion offered to resign if he was found to be involved in the land deal. 
Analysts have said that there would likely be nothing illegal in such a donation, but if proven it could damage Abes credibility given his steadfast denials. 
Kagoike operates a kindergarten in western Japan that inculcates pupils with pre-World War II nationalist and native Shinto religious values and has made insulting comments about Chinese and Koreans. 
When the controversy erupted last month, he was preparing to open an elementary school on the land purchased from the government at a price reportedly some one-tenth the market value. 
The complex scandal has dominated parliamentary deliberations for weeks and his testimony prompted a media frenzy with five networks broadcasting it live. Kagoike was summoned for questioning by lawmakers after his claim last week that Abes wife Akie handed him one million yen ($9,000) in cash in his office in 2015 and said the money was from her husband.

New Zealand Foreign Minister Murray McCully has announced that New Zealand will open a High Commission in Colombo, Sri Lanka.
"Establishing a High Commission in Colombo is a sign of New Zealands commitment to strengthening the relationship between our countries," Mr McCully says.
"Sri Lanka is rebuilding after a generation-long civil war, and we are keen to support that process politically and through a broader economic relationship. It is a growing economy, has a major dairy market and has expressed its interest in learning further about farming from New Zealand.
"Sri Lanka offers increasing value and diversity to our exporters, and is a trade gateway to a fast-growing part of Asia."
The Government, through Budget 2017, has committed $6.2 million in capital funding to establish the High Commission and a further $8.9 million to cover operating costs over the next four years.
The new funding was announced today as part of the launch of Trade Agenda 2030. (voxy.co.nz)

Pera university launches research: To find anti-venom serums for 3 poisonous snakes
	
At least 7 species of highly poisonous snakes have been recovered in the country and there are no anti-venom serums found to treat against three of them, Professor of Veterinary Parasitology R. P. V. J. Rajapakse yesterday said.
He said the Peradeniya University has initiated work on finding antiserums for them in Sri Lanka.
Prof. Rajapakse told the Daily Mirror that the cobra (naya), common krait (thel karawala), Sri Lankan krait (mudu karawala), Russells viper (thith polaga), saw scale viper (weli polanga), hump nose viper (kunakatuwa) and green pit viper (pala polanga) were the 7 highly venomous snakes.
Among the seven, there are no antiserums to treat against Sri Lankan krait, hump nose viper and green pit viper. We are importing antiserums from India. But, they do not produce these antiserums because those snakes are not found in India. Usually, we don't produce antiserums in Sri Lanka, he said.
He said the Department of Veterinary Pathobiology and the Medical Faculty of Peradeniya University have launched researches to produce those antiserums. He also said they have planned to collect necessary substances from around 400 highly poisonous snakes from the country to produce them.
At present, we have collected nearly 90 species. Then, we will send those substances to India to make these antiserums since it will cost a lot of money to do it in Sri Lanka. Around one and a half years will be taken to complete this task, he said.
Meanwhile, he said the Department of Wildlife Conservation and Ministry of Science, Technology and Research had approved it and had lent a hand in their researches. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)

During the past two years, President Sirisena patiently maintained a democratic stance on all issues, but in the remaining four years he intends to fulfil the responsibilities he undertook, Minster Abeywardane told a media conference at the Finance Ministry, in Colombo.
Some of these decisions would be bitter for some and good for others, he claimed.
According to the minister, the main purpose of taking these decisions would be to create a stable government, ensure political stability in the country and as well as the Sri Lanka Freedom Party. There were things that happened during last two years, that can be described as satisfactory and some not, the Minister said.
In response to a question, why the President took so long to take such crucial decisions, the Minister said, When a head of state takes decisions he has to consider various aspects, including his own stability.
He said now the people of the country are of the opinion that it is the right time to make changes on some crucial issues. (Diana Udayangani)

Rathupaswela tragedy: Three Army personnel arrested
	
Three Army personnel were arrested today by the CID in connection with the shooting incident at Rathupaswala in Weliweriya on August 1, 2013.
The investigations have been resumed under the unity government three years after the incident. Among those arrested are: staff sergeant Sirisena, corporals Lalithge and Tillekaratne. They were asked to report to the CID to record a statement this morning and were subsequently arrested. Police said they were produced in Court and remanded till April 3 by acting Gampah Magistrate Wasantha Gunasekera.
However, Army Spokesman Roshan Seneviratne said no action had been taken so far against the personnel taken into custody.
The residents had staged a protest asking for safe drinking water when the army which had been called to defuse the situation had fired at the protesters killing three people and injuring 30. The water in the area had been allegedly polluted by the effluents being discharged by a factory manufacturing rubber gloves. Among those killed were two students -- Akila Dinesh and Ravishan Perera and a person identified as Nilantha Pushpa Kumara.
Human rights groups condemned the crackdown against the protesting villagers who were only demanding for clean drinking water for the thousands of residents of Weliweriya.
The Sri Lanka Human Rights Council (SLHRC) in 2013 submitted a report on the Rathupaswala tragedy and recommended the army to carry out an investigation. (Thilanka Kanakarathna and Tony Karunanayake)

Regular protests, strikes have led to student violence: Akila
	
Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam said today the protests and the work stoppage by extremist groups may have led the school children to resort to violence and aggressive behaviour especially during big match season.
He said such behaviour during the big match season had occurred even in the past but unfortunately today the trend seems to be on the rise and needed to be controlled before it gets out of hand.
The minister said the ministry had discussed this matter with principals of leading schools and that he hoped to resolve this matter sooner than later.
He said this at a news conference held at the BMICH to launch the new Peace Education and Reconciliation Unit (PERU) and the National Unity and Reconciliation (ONUR).
We have recruited 4,000 school principals. There are about 40,000 vacancies for teachers and we will fill those vacancies within the next two years, the minister said. (Ajith Siriwardana)

SL war crimes have caused pain and anguish for India: Sushma
	
The Government of India felt anguish and pain over the Sri Lankan militarys alleged war crimes against unarmed Tamils in the 2009 war, said External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj in an unusually strong observation on the Sri Lankas human rights record.
Ms. Swaraj said India was committed to the protection of the rights of the Tamils in Sri Lanka, even as the U.N. Human Rights Council (HRC) appeared set to take up a crucial resolution on the issue on Friday.
The anguish with which the members have raised the issue [of crimes committed during the war of 2009], the government associates itself with the same pain, Ms Swaraj said.
Our aim is to protect the interests of Tamils in Sri Lanka. You can achieve this through two means: by either doing it forcefully or through persuasion with the friendly country, she said answering a question from D. Raja of the Communist Party of India (CPI). (The Hindu)

SLFP lost its status after MS took over leadership: Basil
	
The Sri Lanka Freedom Partys (SLFP) reputation was damaged soon after President Maithripala Sirisena became its Chairman, former Minister Basil Rajapaksa said yesterday.
Initiating the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) membership drive targeting the Provincial Council elections, Mr. Rajapaksa said that the SLFPs down turn in popularity could be seen when you see the plight of the Habaraduwa and Rathgama SLFP organizers, who were kicked out.
The last hopes of the SLPF in the Galle District were lost as a result of both organizers being replaced. They were responsible, trustworthy MPs who think about the country and its people. From the day President Sirisena was elected as the leader of the party the SLFP lost most of its prestige, he said.
Further, he said that by appointing candidates from the National List to fill the vacancies left by the two reputed organizers, the party has ensured the collapse of the SLFP. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

Thousand evacuated after Ukraine ammo warehouse blasts
	

Thousands were evacuated after the blowing up of a warehouse storing tank ammunition at an eastern military base early on Thursday morning, 
Ukraine said it suspects the Russian military or its separatist rebel proxies were responsible for blowing up the warehouse storing tank ammunition at an eastern military base early on Thursday morning, Defence Minister Stepan Poltorak said. 
Fire and explosions caused the detonation of ammunition in several sites at the base, possibly set off by a drone attack or a radio or timed device, Poltorak told a press conference. 
Nobody was hurt but around 20,000 people have been evacuated from the surrounding area in the eastern Kharkiv region. Firefighters have struggled to douse the flames and explosions at the site continue, sending clouds of thick grey smoke into the sky. 
We have a friendly country - the Russian Federation, Poltorak said. I think that first of all it could be representatives who help the (separatist) groups that carry out combat missions, he said. 
Ukraine did not provide evidence of Russian or rebel involvement. The Russian military did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
The base, which held about 138,000 tonnes of ammunition, is located in the city of Balaklia, about 100 km (60 miles) from the frontline of Ukraines war against Russian-backed separatists.  The warehouse was guarded by around 1,000 people, some of whom heard the sound of an aircraft just before the explosions. Military spokesman Oleksander Motuzyanyk said security around other bases was being beefed up.

The Tamil National Alliance (TNA) today welcomed the adoption of UNHRC resolution 34/L 1 which reaffirms the full implementation of resolution 30/1 of 2015, promoting reconciliation, accountability and human rights in Sri Lanka.
The TNA said in a statement that it welcomed the fact that resolution 34/L 1, gives specific time frames for the Government of Sri Lanka and the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights to report on the successful implementation of the 30/1 resolution at the 37th and 40th UNHRC sessions respectively in 2018 and 2019.
We urge the Government of Sri Lanka to honour its commitment with regard to these resolutions and implement the same in letter and spirit in keeping with its commitments. We also urge the government to sincerely address the issues of land release, the detention of Tamil political prisoners, grievances of the families of missing persons, and the enactment of constitutional reforms.
The Tamil people have reached their limits of tolerance, and urge that their deprivation and suffering on these several issues be brought to an early end.
We welcome the continued engagement and assistance of the international community in achieving the aforesaid. The TNA, as the elected representatives of the Tamil speaking people, reiterates its commitment to closely engage with and monitor the implementation of the UN recommendations and other proposed processes related to reconciliation and transitional justice in Sri Lanka.
The UN and the Human Rights Council and the International Community, we submit, should also take all necessary actions to ensure that the benefits of the implementation of the UN resolution are derived by the people who have been victims, it said.

Wijeyadasa blasts intl community
	
Justice Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe yesterday charged that the international community is making unrealistic demands from Sri Lanka.
Mr Rajapakshe who was speaking during a debate on several regulations in Parliament said looking into the crimes committed during the war time and bringing about reconciliation at the same time is not realistic at all. Reconciliation and probing crimes which took place during the war is like railway tracks which never get together. Probing war time crimes will actually create tension among ethnic groups" he said.
He said the government had done what it could about the requests made by the European Union and its high time Sri Lanka got GSP plus.
Referring to the Hambantota land issue he said both the Opposition and the government should think of the reality without holding on to their respective ideologies on the land issue. "The opposition shouts that the government is giving away lands in Hambantota while the government is saying it has no option but to lease them out. However this Parliament should think of the future as there is going to be a scarcity of lands,'" he said adding that giving the lands on 99 year lease has to be re thought of as the country will regain the lands only after three generations have passed. " Will Sri Lanka be a superpower in 99 years time like China when it got back Hong Kong from UK" he questioned.
Also the minister slammed the Transparency International for demanding to know the assets of the President and Prime Minister just after the right to information act came into effect. " Are the members of Transparency International ready to reveal the amount of dollars they receive from abroad  " he questioned.
Responding to a question raised by JVP MP Vijitha Herath as to why the government agreed to set up hybrid courts in 2015, the Minister said the government had informed the UN that it was not agreeable to it during that time and did not keep quiet about it. (Yohan Perera and Ajith Siriwadana)
