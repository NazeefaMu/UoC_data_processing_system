A success story with numbers
     	 
  At the Daily Mirror, we believe that climate change is one of the greatest threats that we, as Sri Lankans, will face in the future.  Therefore, we intend to provide our readers with local and international content with the objective to educate and inspire. We would also like to learn from our valued readers about any ongoing initiatives in making Sri Lanka a more sustainable nation.   
 We aim to explore sustainable ways of living that have the most positive impact on not just our natural environment, but also for humans and animals.  
While topics such as global warming, pollution, and inequality are confronting, we believe it's time the media stopped shying away from these issues and became an active participant in finding solutions - and we hope you will join us. 
     
				 		 
	
	
               Project Akuru             
Every child has a right to go to school. But not every child is fortunate enough to study in comfortable environments. School life is a fundamental stage that every child has to experience. In Sri Lanka although a majority of children go to school they are deprived of basic facilities, particularly in rural areas. The nearest school would have been the best school as per the programme launched by the government if every school was equally furnished and well-staffed. Certain schools dont have teachers to teach compulsory subjects for O/Ls and as a result students fail their exams. Identifying the need to encourage students to face their examinations with confidence, a group of past pupils of Royal College decided to give them a hand.
The Hinguralakanda Maha Vidyalaya, a school based in the cool environs in Dehiowita houses close to 351 students with 24 teachers. The school curriculum extends until A/Ls but due to less teachers students have lost their interest in studies. As more students failed in mathematics, the team launched their project to instill confidence in these students. Titled as Project Akuru the team visits the school every Sunday and teach them mathematics in the O/L syllabus while training them to do past papers as well.
During a recent visit to this beautiful area, the Mirror For Hope team visited the school and observed the proceedings of the project. We dont have teachers to teach English and Mathematics, said W. Abeywickrama, the principal of the school. The current mathematics teacher resides in Warakapola and it takes a lot of time for her to get to the school. She has to come by bus and then walk several miles as well. When such teachers are appointed it is a disadvantage for the students as well. I observed that most students failed their O/Ls because they failed in mathematics. But after this programme commenced the students have done well in mathematics. We appreciate the work done by this team to bring all the students and teach mathematics to succeed in their exams. Most students started leaving school because we dont have teachers and the necessary facilities. But now it doesnt happen because students started getting good grades. Even if there are teachers in close proximity to the school they have to be sent to the school via the Zonal education department. But what happens is that they appoint whoever they can irrespective of where they stay.
According to Abeywickrama, most parents have lost their trust in the school and have sent their children to other schools. Most of the parents are illiterate and a few students dont come to this class because they are not aware of its importance. The present mathematics teacher doesnt have the time to do an extra class because she has to rush back to the family after school. Most students didnt score anything more than 35 marks at their exams. The teacher sticks to the syllabus and those who cannot grab it falls behind. The teacher cannot give individual attention to each and every student and some students therefore lack basic knowledge about the subject. But in this programme the students were put into groups according to their level of understanding and were trained to work on different mathematical problems, Abeywickrama further said. Abeywickrama also said that the school is willing to provide all the facilities for a teacher if he or she is willing to come and work at the school. They require a teacher who could work follow up on the classwork done at school and encourage the students to face the exams with confidence.
The school is equipped with a computer laboratory and a library. They do not have a science laboratory and another part of the school is under construction.
A few students who sat for the O/L exam after this programme said that it encouraged them to develop an interest towards the subject again. We didnt like mathematics because it was difficult. However this programme gave us an insight to face the exam with confidence and would like to thank the team for supporting us. We would like to request other students to follow it and make use of it.
We wanted to teach students in a remote school, said one of the team members of the Project who wished to remain anonymous. The team lives in and around Kottawa and we wanted to pick on the nearest rural school. Hence we picked on Dehiowita and presented our proposal to the Dehiowita Zonal Education office. They gave us two schools and compared to the other school this had lesser facilities. In this school the teacher also helped us and assisted the students. Our volunteers come as and when they can. We come here on Sundays and I coordinate with them regarding the turns. We have asked for donations from people known to us because not everybody agrees to give us sponsorships. As at now we need support for transport and food and we hope to extend this project to other schools as we proceed.

Destined for love The story of a shoebox
	

Joana, who hailed from Quezon City in Manila, received a shoebox of gifts from an American group named Samaritarian Purses as part of their Operation Christmas Child program. The box had been sent by a young man named Threll who was not much older than from Idaho in the United States.
Operation Christmas Child is a charitable program which invites church members to pack a shoebox with items such as toys, toiletries and school supplies and send to children in countries of need. Philippines, Africa and India have all been part of Operation Christmas Child in the past. Most of the time, the sender will also include a photo of themselves and in this case, little blonde Tyrell included a picture of himself in a cowboy outfit with his name and address. Unbeknown to Tyrel, Joana had written to say thank you as the shoebox had really made an impact on not only her, but also her family. Unfortunately, he never received the letter.
Fast forward 11 years and Joana again attempted to make contact with Tyrel, this time over Facebook but not knowing who she was, he denied the request. Joana was persistent
in wanting to thank the now not- so-young-boy that had put a smile on her face so many years ago. After another friend request, Tyrel became curious about this mystery girl and Joana received a message from him asking how do you know me And she asked him you know about Samaritans Purse.
Tyrel answered, yes, I did that when I was six or seven years old. I dont remember what I put in the box but yeah, I did it. And she responded back, saying I think I got your box.
An online friendship blossomed as they both found out that they had many interests in common while they learned about each others culture and lifestyle.
It was only a matter of time before Tyrel took the plunge and flew out to the Phillipines to meet Joana in person. As their eyes met for the first time, the connection was instant. Once I saw his face, an amazing feeling came over me, Joana recalled. I was so happy I cried. All I knew was Joana was the one, Tyrel expressed.
With heavy hearts they had to say goodbye but upon returning to the Phillipines with his own father, he asked Joanas Pastor Dad for her hand in marriage. He happily agreed and they wed in 2014, in a country-themed wedding at Tyrels parents cattle ranch, 14 years after she received that lucky Christmas gift. Guests at the wedding were asked to then donate Christmas boxes themselves to carry on the tradition of giving to those less fortunate and to celebrate the love that Tyrel and Joana have found because of the project. Tyrel added I remember as a little boy, I was so excited to know the toys and other items I put in the box would bring joy to another child somewhere else in the world. I just didnt know the joy it would bring back to me one day. The couple has recently welcomed their first child into the world, a little boy and are still happily in love and living in the US.

Function in Russia: SriLankan reimbursed SL Embassy Rs. 24 mn, PCoI told
	
SriLankan Airlines had reimbursed the Sri Lankan Embassy in Russia approximately Rs. 24 million that it had allegedly spent to arrange a get-together organised to provide publicity to the newly appointed SriLankan General Sales Agent (GSA) for Russia.
This was revealed in front of the Presidential Commission of Inquiry (PCoI) probing irregularities at SriLankan Airlines, SriLankan Catering and Mihin Lanka by Upekha Abeysekera, Senior Manager, Revenue Accounting at the Airline.
This was when Udayanga Weeratunga was functioning as the Sri Lankan Ambassador to Russia.
Last week it was revealed that Weeratunga had recommended a company, Sri Lanka Limited, to be appointed as General Sales Agent (GSA) for the national carrier in Russia. Writing to the SriLankan country manager in Russia in 2011, Weeratunga had said that Sri Lanka Limited could help the country build closer relationships with Russia and Ukraine and thus should be selected as the airline's GSA.
Although, the party was organized to celebrate the appointment of the airline's new GSA and SriLankan had agreed to bear the expenses, the Russian Embassy had footed the bill. This includes a payment of USD100, 000 for the venue (the Ritz Carlton) and another USD 84, 000 for the handling of VVIP movement. Our embassy had initially paid the bill and we reimbursed that amount, she told the commission.
Last week Shiromi Cooray, Manager Industrial Relations at SriLankan Airlines told the commission that this was the first time, according to her knowledge, that a diplomat has involved himself in the appointment of a GSA for SriLankan Airlines.
The PCoI heard that SriLankan started selecting GSAs, a sales representative for an airline in a specific country or region responsible for selling passenger and cargo space, after the departure of Emirates. Earlier it maintained its own offices in a number of countries. However, even under a GSA system, the airline retains a country manager and an officer in charge of finance, who are provided office space by the GSA. (Yoshitha Perera)

Govt. attempting to sabotage JO protest: MP
	
The joint opposition today charged that the government was frightened about the anti-government protest campaign scheduled for Wednesday and was attempting to sabotage it.
Joint opposition member MP Kanchana Wijesekera told a news conference that the Road Passenger Transport Authority had been ordered to restrict the issuance of temporary road permits for September 5, 6 and 7 in order to decrease the number of vehicles travelling in those days.
The government is planning to prevent people from attending the protest campaign. This situation is reported from many areas across the country mainly in the Western Province, he said.
He said the government was also in an attempt to postpone the Parliamentary sessions scheduled to be held on September 4 and 5 in order to avoid the publication of the parliamentarians comments made during the sessions on the joint oppositions protest campaign.
It was reported that some party leaders had made a request to postpone Parliamentary sessions. We hope it will not happen, he added.
He said the joint opposition had also taken legal advice to proceed with the protest campaign if the government would take steps to sabotage it. He also said there was a possibility of getting the protest campaign extended to the following day (6) depending on the response of the government to their demands.
The Janabalaya Kolambata, anti-government protest campaign organized by the joint opposition is scheduled to be held on September 5 in Colombo at 2.00 pm and the venue of it will be announced on the day of protest. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)

Japans interest  in Trincomalee and the great game in the Indian Ocean
	
Japanese Defence Minister Itsunori Onodera photographed with Indian Defence Minister Nirmala Sitharaman in New Delhi
The visit of Japans Defence Minister Itsunori Onodera to Sri Lanka (Aug 20-22) has significance that goes beyond the fact that it is the first ever by a Japanese Defence Minister to this country. Onoderas visit took the form of a tour of Sri Lankas major ports  Colombo, Trincomalee and Hambantota. It took place within a web of other developments internationally, pointing to heightened geo-strategic interest in the Indian Ocean region. 
It is not without significance that Onodera, before his arrival in Sri Lanka, held talks with Indias Defence Minister Nirmala Sitharaman in Delhi, where the two sides reportedly agreed to start talks on an Acquisition and Cross Service Agreement. Among other measures to counter Chinas growing influence in South Asia they also discussed preparations for the first joint exercise by Japans Ground Self Defence Force and the Indian Army, according to Japan Times. Its no secret that the US, India and Japan have apprehensions over Chinas investments in Sri Lanka including strategic assets like ports, roads and railways, seen as part of its Belt and Road Initiative. The status of Hambantota port in particular, after the government gave its operation to China on a 99-year lease, was followed by accelerated responses designed to counter China.
Onodera, before his arrival in Sri Lanka, held talks with Indias Defence Minister Nirmala Sitharaman in Delhi
	Colombage warns that strategic assets like ports, airports and roads should not be given to country A, B or C.
	The assertions by some government ministers that Onoderas visit had no defence or political aspect, sound disingenuous
Japan depends on sea lanes of the Indian and Pacific Oceans for the import of all its energy requirements, and this has led to its vigorous promotion of a free and open Indo-Pacific concept, endorsed by the US. On 20th August Alice Wells, US Deputy Assistant Secretary for South and Central Asian Affairs held a press briefing in Washington on US Policy in the Indian Ocean Region where she drew attention to the USs recently announced $300 million in security funding for the region. In this context she mentioned the USs Bay of Bengal initiative (not to be confused with BIMSTEC) which she said will enhance the capacity of Bangladesh and Sri Lanka to share shipping information with other partners in the region such as India Its also relevant that in response to a journalists question, Wells remarked  I think one of the great new elements of our relationship with India is that we are working in third parties and third countries. 
It would seem that all of these developments taking place around the same time, are too much of a coincidence to be a coincidence. The visit of a Japanese warship to Trincomalee port during Onoderas visit, was followed by the arrival of the amphibious transport dock USS Anchorage - part of the US 7th fleet - in Trincomalee, for a visit that included exercises with the SL Navy and Marines. The strategic motives behind frequent US naval ship visits to Sri Lankas ports were laid bare in the remarks of the US embassys Charge dAffaires Robert Hilton who said: Were also excited to try out the air logistics hub concept which utilizes Sri Lankas strategic location in the Indian Ocean to ensure the quick availability of relief supplies, equipment and other material when needed by the U.S. and partner militaries and humanitarian organizations. The military overtones though not explicit, were clear. 
The fear that China will use Hambantota as a military base persists, in spite of assurances to the contrary from both Sri Lanka and China. This was obviously the concern underlying Onoderos remark to NHK World:Despite Chinas long term lease, it is internationally acknowledged that the port should be free and open to the public.
Questioning the assumptions behind this comment Admiral (Prof) Jayanath Colombage, Director of the Centre for Indo-Lanka initiatives and Law of the Sea at the Pathfinder Foundation asked Why should someone tell us what to do We are an open country, we welcome (ships from) all. None of the Sri Lankan ports should be used by anyone for military purposes. Pointing out that in the period 20092018 warships from no less than 27 countries visited Sri Lanka, the former Navy Commander asked What is meant by military purposes If a ship calls in a port for fuel, water etc its not military but a goodwill visit. If they come to act against another country, that is military he said. We welcome anyone, only they shouldnt come with the intention of harming anyone, especially India. 
Against the backdrop of a fast changing external environment, how well have Sri Lankas political leaders and policy makers steered the course Regrettably, rather than skillfully balancing diplomacy with economic and defence priorities, the government appears to be trying to set off investment opportunities given to one foreign power against concessions granted to another, in an ad hoc manner, lacking any consistent policy designed to serve the national interest. Sri Lanka tried to allay New Delhis fears over Hambantota by entering into a joint venture with Indias airports authority to lease out the Hambantota international airport to manage it, said a PTI report, reflecting this perception. 
Colombage warns that strategic assets like ports, airports and roads should not be given to country A, B or C. 
They should be developed as joint ventures or with foreign direct investment but their ownership should be with Sri Lanka. 
The downplaying of Onoderas visit to the Trincomalee Oil Tank Farm  which was not mentioned as part of his itinerary in any of the official statements - is another puzzle. More so because this site has historical significance. In the course of World War II,on 9th April 1942 one of the tanks was hit and completely destroyed by Japanese kamikaze suicide pilots, during an attack on Trincomalee naval base in which hundreds of airmen are said to have been killed. The oil tank farm is the largest tank farm in South Asia and of great strategic value as it falls between West Asia and Singapore, according to a 2013 PTI report. The use of the remaining 99 tanks, in which India has a partial stake, has also been subject to some controversy. 
At a time when the defence dimension has become inextricably entangled with Sri Lankas infrastructure development involving strategic assets, the assertions by some government ministers that Onoderas visit had no defence or political aspect, sound disingenuous. The Trincomalee leg of his tour - handled by the SLN and not the Sri Lanka Ports Authority - clearly had a defence dimension, buttressed by the Japanese ship visit during the tour. Defence cooperation and maritime security were key elements in the statements by President Sirisena and Prime Minister Wickremesinghe following their meetings with the Japanese Defence Minister. The PMs statement in fact started with reference to the importance developing defence ties and an MoU on Defence (avabodataa givisumak). It may be inferred that any such agreement would be consonant with US and Indian objectives in the region. 
The efforts to deflect attention away from Trincomalee, the most strategically important stop in Onoderas tour, only give rise to more speculation as to whether a defence agreement was discussed. Instead of blaming media for carrying misleading reports, the government would do better to demonstrate transparency regarding agreements it reaches, or hopes to reach, with other countries, no matter whether they relate to trade, investment or defence.

Thushyanthy presents the story of Lord Krishna when he entered the arena to confront the cruel king Kans.
Culture and tradition are not stagnant in its form and expanse. Just like pollen grains are taken around by the wind, culture, tradition and art forms have reached every corner of the world through its migrant diaspora.
This has paved way for the creation of many traditional artists outside their origin. These artists go through stringent and rigorous training in their respective art forms irrespective of being in one place. And through this art form and training they get closer to their roots and become ambassadors of that art form and culture. This is the story of Thushyanthy and Gayathri who are management professionals continuing their passion for dance through variety of performances.

Notes for a Manifesto: Understanding the executive
	
There was a time when the executive in relation to the State consisted of the Cabinet of Ministers led by the Prime Minister. Things were pretty simple back then. And clear. The rest of the Parliament made the laws. The judges did their thing. There was no confusion about the boundaries that separated the executive, judicial and legislative branches of the State. 
Things werent all perfect back then of course, but things did go downhill after 1978. That was when the Second Republican Constitution was enacted and J.R. Jayewardene elected by Parliament as the Executive President. 
Lets use an analogy just to illustrate the powers vested in the office of the President. If the constitution is a tree then the executive presidency is its roots, trunk, branches, leaves, flowers, fruit and in fact everything. We need not elaborate. The consistent call for curtailing the power of the president is testimony enough to the widely held view that this concentration of power is not healthy in a democracy. 
Three factors made things worse. First, after the scare of impeachment in 1991, President Ranasinghe Premadasa, purchased dissidents with ministerial portfolios. Immediately, within the overarching executive structure, the percentage of demi-executives (if you will) in Parliament increased. 
Secondly, there was the introduction of the decentralized budget which resulted in all MPs being given money which they could essentially use for development as per their whims and fancies. They could decide how much to spend and on what. They were given executive functions. Naturally, representatives as well as those aspiring to represent came to think of a parliamentary seat as something which offered executive power. 
Thirdly, we had the Supreme Court decision delivered by Chief Justice Sarath N Silva allowing for those in the Opposition to break ranks and still retain their parliamentary seat provided they were given a Cabinet portfolio. That was a device used by those in power to manage parliamentary arithmetic. What it also did was to further inflate the executive. 
Sure, the Executive President had the sweep and ministers merely toed the line, each minister acquired, naturally, an executive mindset. 
As a result the function of all this, legislative functions were limited to rubber-stamping exercises where the will of the Chief Executive, the President, was routinely endorsed. 
While the yahapalanists sought a mandate to abolish the executive presidency without addressing the dangers of such a move without a simultaneous abolishing of the 13th Amendment, it was tired rhetoric for the most part. We did get the 19th Amendment, but it did not address the executive-branching described above and neither did it abolish the executive presidency
While the yahapalanists sought a mandate to abolish the executive presidency without addressing the dangers of such a move without a simultaneous abolishing of the 13th Amendment, it was tired rhetoric for the most part. We did get the 19th Amendment, but it did not address the executive-branching described above and neither did it abolish the executive presidency. Powers were clipped and the UNP/Ranil-loyalists truly believed (and some still believe) that Maithripala Sirisena was to be just a figurehead while Ranil Wickremesinghe was the principal executive in the government. However, the true quantum of power can easily be obtained by answering a simple question: Who, with the least effort, can effect the greatest change Thats still the Executive President, folks. 
So what can be done to rectify this glaring democracy-deficit The answer lies is making the demarcations clear. We have options. 
We can revert to the pre-1978 arrangement along with electoral reform to obtain better representation. This has to go hand in hand with legislation not just limiting the size of the Cabinet but specifying subjects. Technically the number of ministries could be reduced to less than 10. If this were done, those seeking public office will do so with considerably reduced executive aspirations. They would have to reconcile themselves to the (boring un-remunerative) task of making laws, i.e. the traditional, true and principal function of Parliament. The notion decentralized budget would have to be dropped as well. 
If the executive presidency is to remain (as it should unless the illegal, erroneous and dangerous 13th Amendment is repealed), any truncation should take into account the necessity to remove all confusion between legislature and executive, leaving no room for any representative to harbour executive illusions even as they are empowered to vote according to their conscience and not on party lines nor out of fear of the Presidents wrath. 
It is also possible to draw from the US system where Cabinet members are not elected but are chosen by the President and have to be approved by the representatives. If there were to be a robust vetting system, this could technically make for a more professional Cabinet where its members would have to be endowed with proven expertise in the given field. One has to ask the following question in this regard; if applicants to jobs have to possess specified skills, why then is that same requirement not imposed on those aspiring to cabinet posts 
Those aspiring to be President and those parties which want to capture political power need to address the confusion and anomalies pertaining to the necessity of obtaining a balance in the separation of powers. Just saying I/we will abolish the executive presidency will not do because it does not indicate any idea about obtaining clarity by demarcating the lines between the executive and legislative arms of the state. 
Please take note, Nagananda Kodituwakku, Rohan Pallewatte, Gotabaya Rajapaksa, Patali Champika Ranawaka, Ranil Wickremesinghe, Maithripala Sirisena and any other individual who is entertaining hopes of becoming the next President of Sri Lanka.

Overworked on Overtime The  toil behind the smile that greets I am shocked and surprised
	
Chandani is 21 and the sole breadwinner of a family of three. Standing at the cashiers bay at a plush supermarket in Colombo she serves each customer walking in to pay their bills. Most of the days I work here from 8.00 in the morning to 11.00 in the night, thats how I make ends meet she told the Daily Mirror Asked her if she remained standing during that entire time, she replied in the affirmative. Yes, we have to  she responds.
Many of the female and male workers stationed around the island at supermarkets go through the same predicament as Chandani, an investigation by the Daily Mirror revealed. Paid just above the minimum wage, they are given a basic salary ranging from Rs.12,900 (recruited as trainees and an increment of Rs.1,000 upon confirmation) to 17,500 (upper limit). The rest of the pay packet depends on the hours they put in as overtime. Cashiers who need to possess a pass in Mathematics at their O/Levels are given a Rs.1,000 higher than the Customer Services Assistant (CSA), the staff member who walks down the aisle. 
Supermarket employees overtime underpaid
We usually have to work for over 100 hours in order to earn overtime to take home something around Rs. 25,000, Piyumi another 20-year-old Customer Service Assistant working at another supermarket in Colombo told us. 
A standard shift ranges from both 8.00 am to 5.00 pm and 2.00 pm to 10.00 pm or from 7.00 am to 5.00 pm and 12.00 noon to 10.00 pm depending on which chain one asks. At least that is what is on paper. Apsara told us on Tuesday (August 28) night that the shift although on paper is from 8.00 am to 5.00 pm, in practice starts at 7.00 am. Tuesday was her day for an overworked overtime. 7.00 am to 11.30 pm - a double shift.
The store opens at 8.30 am but we have to be here by around 7.00 am. We close at 10.00 pm, but by the time we leave the place it is around 11.30 in the night. Daily Mirror roamed around a few of Colombos supermarkets from 11.00 pm onwards. The workers remained inside the stores, although the doors were closed for customers. 
The basic salary is paid for the standard shift. The rest has to be earned through working overtime. The shifts are in violation of the Shop and Office Act under which they are employed. The standard overtime ranges from around Rs. 90 to Rs.103 per hour, depending on which chain one asks.  So if we are to make an extra Rs.10,000 which is usually 100 hours extra, we have no option but to do 6-7 hours overtime for around 15 days a month they told us. The minimal allowances or the statutory EPF, ETF deduction to the salaries have not been included in the calculation. Most of the employees look forward to a public holiday to work on which they get paid a full days overtime. They were given four full days and four half-a-days with the option of opting to work overtime on the holidays. Most workers were hesitant to provide us with the information despite our disguise as potential seekers for jobs for a family friends daughter, the Cashiers, Customers Service Agents insisted on us speaking to their superiors. But during each visit and each check out they obliged with basic details. I am paid Rs.12,900 and have been here since 7.00 am in the morning one of the Cashiers told us as we checked out on the night on August 23. 
Do they need to be standing the whole time We asked the person who identified herself as a Human Resources Officer at another supermarket, sounding some concern. Yes, that is a part of their job we were told.
Have you been standing the whole time We asked. Yes, except during the lunch break, which we were told was not a set time. 15 to 30 minutes is what we have. 
Do they need to be standing the whole time We asked the person who identified herself as a Human Resources Officer at another supermarket, sounding some concern. Yes, that is a part of their job we were told. For 14 hours a day for half the month We persist to receive a gentle smile from the Human Resources Officer. That is what they sign up for. Look at the experience they get, she told us. 
Despite some of the information being initially forthcoming, there was evident reluctance to divulge during the second visits to the same branches. In fact, a person identifying himself as an Executive at one of the branches sought to speak on behalf an employee. They can take around Rs. 40,000 home he said without batting an eyelid. We looked at the Customer Sales Agent (CSA) standing right beside us and asked if it were true, she smiled. The dynamics of the working hours are intriguing. Sometimes, there is a standard number of hours that all employees of a particular branch could work overtime. During some months we get a set number of hours and all of us share these hours with the rest of our colleagues. If we are understaffed someone would be lucky to put in more hours of overtime, the Human Resource Administrator at one of the branches of a Colombo-based supermarket told Daily Mirror So tell her she can earn close to Rs. 30,000 if she works hard, we are told to convey to the potential recruit.
What was indicative that even in one chain, there are no standard practices. They differ from branch to branch. 
We tried doing the math again. If we are to take Rs.15,000 as the base salary, that is Rs.15,000 lesser than the 30,000 we were told a person working hard could earn and we are to assume each worker gets Rs.100 per hour as overtime, that is a cumulative of 150 hours they have to work extra to make the additional Rs.15,000. That is for a 26-day a month, 5 hours extra each day again assuming that they would be working the entire month to catch up to the 150 hours. 12 hours every day on their feet, smiling to the unsuspecting customer, greeting them hiding the suffering behind the standard logo smile at all customers. The calculation is based on a cumulative or aggregate figure which varies minutely depending on who and where you ask. All supermarket chains provide lodging if required or transport if the residence is located within a certain parameter. She can claim Rs. 2,000 extra for boarding per month if she lives outstation and doesnt want to stay at the boarding house. The conditions at the boarding houses, the workers are given as lodging, bears a different story altogether. 
So if we are to make an extra Rs.10,000 which is usually 100 hours extra, we have no option but to do 6-7 hours overtime for around 15 days a month
We asked Pathum (22), a male who works as a cashier at one of the branches whether the income is enough to survive. This is how it is, isnt it I either cant live, because we only get paid Rs. 17,500 basic with minimal allowances or I dont have a life as I have to live here to earn Rs. 30,000 he told us. Many of the outlets are understaffed and as a result those working are given the benefit of overtime.
Pathum was doing a full days shift when we met him. 7.00 am to 11.00 pm. We asked him how often he does this. I try to do 130 to 150 hours of overtime each month he said. That is virtually spending his life -- except his sleeping hours -- at the supermarket. He did not seem to mind it. This is good, we work hard and we earn more, that is how it should be isnt it 
All supermarket chains provide dinner to the employees who do the night shift. The rest have to fend for themselves. Some provide lunch, but most dont. 
Some supermarket chains had stools or chairs behind the cashiers counter, while the others did not. Depending on which chain and which branch one walks into the conditions are self-evident. We ask them whether they are allowed to sit. Any consumer who has shopped at a supermarket would be aware that seldom have they seen a worker seated on the stools/chairs provided. Even the worker at the counter that is not busy. 
No we arent allowed to sit we were told. Repetitive Strain Injuries or the long term spinal cord related complications which can ensue as a result of how the work is ignored. We are only given a training on the main routine work. We werent taught how to move our body to minimize any health risk Wathsala 22, told us. Many of the female workers were bonded into overtime. I have taken a loan, and if I am to survive and send money home, working overtime is a must. The basic isnt enough to even look around, Chandani told us. 
No thats nonsense, have you looked at the benefits they get We replied in the affirmative and broke it down to the numbers. Then we were told that this was the industry standard.
During a casual conversation with a member of the Management Committee of one of the Chains, we brought this up. First there was the denial. No thats nonsense, have you looked at the benefits they get We replied in the affirmative and broke it down to the numbers. Then we were told that this was the industry standard. This is how labour markets operate, we can move into automation. Its a free market and these people come here because they get their benefits. Hardly an argument there, except that the argument had be brought time and time again, world over including against the Plantation workers in Sri Lanka. They are given three meals a day, lodging and transport, so the real costs have been covered we were told. Hardly true, but we plodded on How would a customer react if they were seated That is why they are not seated he told us. The overtime is their choice, if they want to earn more they have to do that, he said before asking us to give them a figure we thought could be the best minimum wage to be paid. 
Chandani, however, insisted that she had no choice in the working hours. How could I take care of my family with Rs.17,500 sir She asked. I have no choice but to continue doing these hours.
Is It Ethical and Humane
Sepali Kottegoda
(Author-Transforming Lives: Listening to Sri Lankan Returnee - Women Migrant Workers) Director Programmes - Women and Media Collective
This is a new phenomenon which has over the last 5 years, taken a lot of youth as employees. There is a rapid growth of supermarkets around urban areas and the suburbs. The working conditions seems to be similar to that of the Free Trade Zone which are basically sweet shops. They (FTZ workers) have to stand because of the nature of the work they do. But at the Supermarket Counters it isnt so. In any event, we must know what sort of support the company gives to the girls at the counters. It is physically unacceptable for them to be standing for such a long hours.
Especially given the fact that their basic wages are so low and they are compelled to work overtime, if they want to make ends meet. Physical and mental health of these workers are a big issue. The fact that they have to stand for such long hours to make for their survival would eventually result in the deterioration of their physical and mental health. If these companies where they are employed do not provide them with the required facilities, working conditions and remuneration, then we must question under what principles these companies are operating with. 
The working conditions seems to be similar to that of the Free Trade Zone which are basically sweet shops. They (FTZ workers) have to stand because of the nature of the work they do
The other factor is that these companies provide hostels. Since this is a new phenomenon we assume that they meet the legal requirements but that is also an aspect that must be looked into. Many of the females who are employed in Colombo are from outstations. Further, to work 10-12 hours a day is not only a violation of labour regulations, it is also exploitative. There is a cap on how longer an employee can work overtime, but that also doesnt seem to be adhered to according to what you say. These labour regulations seem to be violated consistently. 
True, the argument can be brought that they are working the overtime shifts out of choice. But how far does an argument of that sort hold sway in a humane and ethical perspective, is a question that must be asked. Do these employees really have a choice in todays context, the physical, mental and financial well-being of them are the issues that must be considered. Given all of this, should the patrons of these supermarkets concerned is a question that must be raised We must question the Principles of these Companies.

I am shocked and surprised at the wages you are telling me that these employees earn. I really am. I thought they are given a better pay, a living wage. These people must be given a living wage. The fact that they have to stand for so long is the other issue. Is the practice sustainable How does this affect their productivity, and long term physical and mental health or have they been looked into are the areas which must draw our attention. 
There remains a distortion in the labour market, where an office assistant in the government sector gets a salary of around Rs. 30,000 with all the benefits, including a pension for the service that does not really deserve all of that.
Eventually it costs the government around Rs.200 billion rupees annually which we cant afford to pay. It remains an enormous challenge. These distortions among many others by consecutive failures on a level of policy that has resulted in the outcome such as these. 
The fact that they have to stand for so long is the other issue. Is the practice sustainable
Women today are moving away from the agriculture industry. Men and women used to work in the field but now they are moving to urban areas in search of employment.
What we also must understand is employing women entails a higher cost for the company and there is inbuilt resistance among companies, a glass ceiling of some sort which must be dealt and broken down at a policy level. Its paramount that attention to these areas are given. With regard to the issue you have brought up, I will draw serious attention to it.
They are Exploited
- Sylvester Jayakody
General Secretary- Ceylon Mercantile Industrial & General Workers Union (CMU)
Most exploited workers in the present world are in many fields which include those who work in the manpower, Casual and Security sectors (majority of whom are retirees), garbage collectors and workers employed in the service sector such as petrol pump stations, and the hotel sector.
The workers who work in Supermarkets can be defined as workers who are Super Exploited as they are vulnerable to all kinds of harassment and ill treatment. The reasons are manifold. Among them, are the fact that they are not represented by Unions and the Unions have no say about those workers without representative authority for them. The Labour Department is not assisting them in any way to improve their working conditions. The monitoring apparatus of the Labour department does not function. The research we have done revealed shocking factors and unbelievable some times.
Some of them leave home at 5.00 in the morning and depending on the distance it varies. Some of them reach home at 12.30 midnight or at times at 1.00 am! The salaries they receive depends on town to town. When we inquired from a girl in one of the Supermarkets in Kilinochchi, we had been told that she gets Rs.8,000/ a month and if she works 26 days she can get about Rs.16.000 or Rs.17.000.
The workers in the Supermarkets continue to work standing for more than 8 hours and some times without a change. They have to keep smiling with the customers and show a pleasing face to all
When inquired about the Budgetary relief allowance, she could not answer as she was ignorant of such an allowance! When we said the minimum salary is Rs.10.000 in the whole country and the government allowances should be added, she was stunned.
The budgetary allowances are as follows.
2005 August Rs.1,000/ 2015 May Rs.1,500/ 2016 January Rs.1,000 / 
The workers in the Supermarkets continue to work standing for more than 8 hours and some times without a change, even for a call of nature. They have to keep smiling with the customers and show a pleasing face to all, which we think is a way of human torture. The leave is not defined and they prefer to work rather than stay at home in view to increase the income due to the meagre salary they get.
They are required to work continuously during the festive seasons with no breaks or holidays. Of course they get meagre wages and pretend that is humane remuneration, which in reality it is not. In some places they are given transport facilities. 
We are not aware of tea time facilities or meals being provided by the Supermarket owners.

40 per cent of Army joined after the war
	
At least 40 per cent of those within the Sri Lanka Army had joined after the end of the war in 2009, Kilinochchi Security Forces Commander Major General Nissanka Ranawana said.
He said this at a press briefing organized on Joint Field Exercise Cormorant Strike held at the Sri Lanka Electrical & Mechanical Engineers (SLEME) auditorium.
He said such exercises would be a platform to those who had joined the Army after the end of the war, to get an invaluable military experience.
Major General Ranawana said exercises were required to take on any future challenges against the country or its people.
This is the largest joint military field exercise. The participants are expected to train under 20 special missions some of them similar to the missions carried out during the war. The main objective of this exercise is to share the knowledge and skills with foreign forces and experiment new techniques, he said.
He said that the exercise would be conducted under the supervision of a Special Committee under the directives of the Army Commander Mahesh Senanayake. (Darshana Sanjeewa)

Hundreds of viewers flock in Kandy to witness the Esala Perahera every August. Devotees who gather besides the streets to witness the pageant are in the practice of laying plastic sheets on the pavement where they could sit and view the procession from. As crowds gather in the hill capital, streets are usually full of vendors of street food, snacks, toys and ornaments. Sadly however, after the procession, the streets are littered with discarded plastic sheets, food wrappers, disposable cups and plates. Each year the Hanthana Conservation Society of the University of Peradeniya dedicates a special project to educate and raise awareness on the proper disposal of litter during the month of August.
This year too, four teams comprising 30 to 40 university students took to the streets of Kandy to help educate the public about the importance of proper disposal of litter. Team member Ayesh Dumindu Nirmal said that the project was carried out targeting the last five Randoli perahera days, when great crowds gather in the city. The students in groups addressed the crowds all over the city and encouraged them to dispose litter in a proper manner. They also made a humble request to the viewers to take responsibility of their own garbage.
The society was assisted by the Central Environmental Authority with equipment such as megaphones. The project was also live streamed on social media in order to spread awareness among the greater public. The municipal council employs special groups to clean the city after the procession every night. This is a time consuming and costly exercise. We were informed that our project was a success as these cleaners had taken lesser time and had collected less garbage during the days when we carried out our campaign, Nirmal said.

President Maithripala Sirisena seems to believe that focusing on North Central and North Western Provinces would secure his future at upcoming elections. Being an individual from the village, his focus has been on irrigation and cultivation. Very recently Sirisena launched the Water to Wayamba Programme at Polpethigama, giving hope to thousands of farmers. But the president has made the mistake of not being hawk-eyed on key areas like consumer prices of goods, education and the upcoming Janabalaya Colombata protest, to be stages in Colombo on September 5.

Right now he (Sirisena) should be playing the role of a political animal like Gotabaya Rajapaksa
	Nothing can be achieved if the business community in the country is unhappy
	President Sirisena must be proactive and not reactive as he is known to be
	Sirisena should not oppose everything that Premier Ranil Wickremesinghe and his henchmen in the Government propose
The presidents role at the moment shouldnt be the one played by the minister handling irrigation and water resources. Right now he should be playing the role of a political animal like Gotabaya Rajapaksa. The party that Sirisena represents, Sri Lanka Freedom Party, has already indicated that it would not have tie-ups with the UNP nor the newly formed Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna. Given this scenario, questions are raised whether the president is doing enough to make the SLFP candidates at the next provincial councils elections favourites. 
Nothing can be achieved if the business community in the country is unhappy. This community also includes small-scale business holders who also have a stake in the economy. The aggressive tax policies of this Government and the much criticised Sri Lanka-Singapore Free Trade Agreement (FTA) have put this regime on the back foot. What annoys the public about this FTA is the Government concealing the true nature of this agreement. 
The president must know enough about business to fathom whether any deal that Sri Lanka signs with another nation fills the purse of some privileged individuals or whether it benefits the country as a whole
Hot on the heels of the defeat at the last LG Polls, the Government suffered another setback when the Provincial Delimitation Commission Report was rejected in Parliament. The majority present in Parliament on the day of voting gave a solid indication that this nation prefers the proportional representation system to the tried and failed mixed electoral system. 
However, despite the country demanding elections when due, this Government is inclined towards postponing them by appointing committees to look into election-related issues. 
Predictable
Going by all indications, President Sirisena would contest the 2020 Presidential Elections. The biggest advantages he has in support of his probable candidacy are that he is a simple person and his thinking is not complicated. Other than his future ambition, which many guess is to run for presidency again, his moves have been predictable. Other than the occasions when he put his foot down and changed the decisions taken by other ministers in the Cabinet, he has allowed this country to function without much interference. 
This would be one reason why there is so much lawlessness in the island and the rampant trading of illegal narcotics. This president is not known to drive fear into the public like the last regime did. This could be one reason why there are so much strikes and protests in the country, often crippling the day-to-day activities of the people.
Time to be proactive
President Sirisena must be proactive and not reactive as he is known to be. Many believe that he should acquire business acumen like some of the past presidents of the country, if he is to become a proactive person. Sri Lankan politics has shown that one doesnt need much qualifications to be the Finance Minister of this nation. Two past ministers who held this vital post and didnt have a professional background in finance to do so were former President Mahinda Rajapaksa (his degree is in law) and Ravi Karunanayake (formerly an accountant). Even the present Minister of Finance Mangala Samaraweera can only boast of being qualified in apparel designing. Politics has shown that this is a profession where one learns on the job. What one needs to succeed as a politician is total commitment towards the ministry assigned to each individual. 
Sri Lanka is burdened by the need to clear its debt commitment. As much as taxes are needed by the Government, this regime must keep a tab on the fact that consumer prices rose in July to 3.4 % on year-on-year basis to 2.5% in June. The rupee last Friday had reached a record low to be at 160.82 as against the US $. Sirisena should not oppose everything that Premier Ranil Wickremesinghe and his henchmen in the Government propose. People change after taking to politics. Sirisena, as many opine, hasnt. As a person, Sirisena need not, but in terms of business thinking he certainly must pull up his socks. The Government signing a trade agreement with Singapore has come under fire by many. The president must know enough about business to fathom whether any deal that Sri Lanka signs with another nation fills the purse of some privileged individuals or whether it benefits the country as a whole. 
These are times when Singapore, China, India and even the USA are showing interest in being stakeholders in Government ventures. It would serve Sirisena well if he looks at Sri Lanka from a business perspective to ensure that this island derives the best from its dealings with others nations.

Presidential Elections likely in January Only if MS, MR join hands
	
New political alliances and formations are common occurrence when the national elections are around the corner. The presidential elections are scheduled to be conducted at the end of next year. Now, the countrys political air is pregnant with preparations for such happenings. The latest is a move to forge an electoral pact between President Maithripala Sirisena and former President Mahinda Rajapaksa. 
It is difficult to expect the Joint Opposition, which includes the SLPP, to agree to any electoral pact with the President
	As such, he said Mahinda Rajapaksa was trying to exploit lacunas in the law to see whether he could become the candidate
	Though it is not openly articulated, the UNP is also bracing for the Presidential Elections
	Higher Education Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe said that there was no lacuna in the law that would enable Mahinda to become the presidential candidate
Efforts are now underway for this project with the backing of a section of the Joint opposition.The proposed political deal is brokered by former Minister MP S. B. Dissanayake on behalf of President Sirisena. 
In terms of the Constitution, the President, upon completion of four years in office during his first term, can call for a presidential election. That is to seek a mandate for him to run for another term. The President will complete four years in office in January, next year. If he wishes to be the candidate, he can declare elections at any time afterwards. 


Forging unity 

Against the backdrop of such legal interpretations on the laws governing the Presidential Elections, it is learned that Dissanayake, backed by a few other members of the Joint Opposition or the Mahinda Rajapaksa faction of the United Peoples Freedom Alliance (UPFA), has undertaken a political project to forge unity between the two leaders. The proposal is to nominate President Sirisena as the next candidate to contest the polls. The agreement, if struck, will provide for premiership to be offered to someone from the Rajapaksa camp. 
As far as the Joint Opposition is concerned, MP Vasudeva Nanayakkara is openly supportive of such a political arrangement in view of the next presidential elections. Besides, it is learned that a few others in that political camp also favour the idea to nominate the President. But, they are not openly vocal about it. 
Be that as it may, widespread support is unlikely from the Joint Opposition for President Sirisena to be made the candidate. As things stand at the moment, anti-President sentiments run high among the rank and file of the Joint Opposition. In fact, the overtures made by the Presidents representatives to the Joint Opposition to strike an electoral agreement with regard to the February 10 Local Government Polls were thrown out of the window. 
At that time, one proposal was to field a common list of candidates by Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) and the Presidents UPFA under a common symbol. The other one was to share the local bodies between the two sides to contest. Had the agreement been struck, the SLPP would have contested some local bodies and the Presidents party the others in cooperation with each other. Such overtures were rebuffed even at that time. It all shows that any proposal that aims at giving the upper hand to the President is looked at with disdain by most in the other side. 
As such, it is difficult to expect the Joint Opposition, which includes the SLPP as the dominant political force, to agree to any electoral pact with the President that gives him the pride of place.
Let alone, according to sources close to the Joint Opposition, any understanding between the President and the Joint opposition cannot be totally ruled out, though. The Presidents participation in the funeral of Mr. Rajapaksas brother Chandra Rajapaksa gives rise to speculation about such a possible patch-up. If such a thing is to happen, it will be according to the terms and conditions stipulated by the Joint Opposition. 
Come what may, the Presidential Elections can be called prematurely only if the President intends to contest. One cannot expect the President to be the candidate without the support of the UNP or the Rajapakasa camp under the current political circumstances. Accordingly, a snap presidential election can be expected only in the event of such an electoral deal. Otherwise, the presidential elections will take place according to schedule at the end of the year. 
UNP braces for elections
Though it is not openly articulated, the UNP is also bracing for the Presidential Elections according to party sources. In fact, the party has prioritised political work over everything else.
The UNP believes the rifts within the Joint Opposition on its prospective presidential candidate will widen and snowball into a full-blown crisis ahead of the election. Accordingly, the UNP believes such a crisis within the opposition will eventually be politically beneficial to it. 
There is a simmering crisis in the Joint Opposition. It is like a volcano that can erupt any time, Minister Sajith Premadasa once remarked at a party discussion that took place before Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe left for Vietnam.
As such, he said Mahinda Rajapaksa was trying to exploit lacunas in the law to see whether he could become the candidate or not. 
The Prime Minister remarked at this point that Mahinda Rajapaksa was trying to break the law of the country. 
Higher Education Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe said that there was no lacuna in the law that would enable Mahinda to become the presidential candidate. 
Minister Daya Gamage opined that the 19th Amendment or any other law could not be enforced retrospectively. 
Minister Rajapakshe replied that though the law did not have any retrospective effect, past actions of any individual could be covered under it.

SLFP govt. by next Sinhala-Hindu New Year: Dilan
	
Badulla District Parliamentarians, Dilan Perera said today that the 15 SLFP group of rebels are determined to form an SLFP government with other progressive forces by hook or by crook by the next Sinhala and Hindu New Year and put Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe in his rightful place.
Mr. Perera vowed that a government sans the UNP would be formed with the cooperation of all the progressive forces like the MEP, LSSP, CPSL, NFF, PHU and DLF,
Mr. Perera also expressed his doubts on the conjecture floated by a group of Mahinda Rajapaksa supporters that the ex President could become the Executive President for a third time but added it would be great (Mal Hathai) if possible.
I have a problem in this claim that former President Rajapaksa could contest the next Presidential election and become President for a third time. If he could do it he is the best politician to be the next President and there is no doubt about it, he stressed.
Responding to a journalist at yesterdays weekly news briefing of the SLFP rebel group in Colombo as to what would be the position of incumbent President Maithripala Sirisena in case Mahinda wins the Presidential poll, Mr. Perera said the next Executive President who will be elected under the provisions of the 19th Amendment to the Constitution will be a weak and powerless President.
Under the 19th Amendment, the Prime Minister is more powerful than the President. Therefore, Mahinda can become the all powerful Prime Minister under a weak Sirisena as the President, he said.
Mr. Perera who is also a lawyer said Nihal Jayawickrama, Prof. G.L Peiris and many others have floated this idea of Mahinda contesting the forthcoming Presidential poll and becoming Executive President for a third time as they like to think in that way but the reality was far away and the 19th Amendment was very clear about it.
He denied the remarks that had been made by Transport and Civil Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala De Silva that President Sirisena or the SLFP Central Committee ever consented to the suggestion that the SLFP Ministers must quit the Yahapalana Government.
I wonder whether Minister De Silva whom I respect much and my district leader was suffering from dementia when he said this. Former Minister Anura Priyadharshana Yapa made the request in writing and Minister De Silva himself made a request to Prime Minister Wickremesinghe with the knowledge of party leader, President Sirisena to resign from the post of Prime Minister. I addition the proposal that the SLFP must quit the government was sumitted to the partys Central Committee but never discussed it or approved as General Secretary was Minister Duminda Dissanayaka. Minister De Silva further said at a later stage that SLFP Ministers in the government work in cahoots with those SLFP members who had quit the government to topple the UNP led government and form SLFP government. When the time comes both groups would joint to do the job, he added.
Mr. Perera said he expected that Mr. Perera would refrain from making what he called mongol remarks hereafter.(Sandun A Jayasekera)

Social media becoming a global disruptive force: PM
	
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said today that the technology-driven new media including social media is a source of non-traditional threat and becoming a global disruptive force.
The new media including social media sites such as Facebook, Twitter and other websites are becoming global disruptive forces. We have seen the potential of this new media to de-establish nations and affect series of changes, he said.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe as the chief guest of the Colombo Defence Seminar organized by the Sri Lanka Army, delivered the keynote speech during the inaugural session held at the BMICH.
He underlined the need to continue intellectual interaction of this nature to resolve and identify global issues of defence relevance.
The nature of warfare are shifting from physical to online, or into the increased use of computers electromagnetism and artificial intelligence in commercial, economic, military and all other cutting-edge activities, the Prime Minister said.
He said it is essential to apply best practice approach to reduce national vulnerabilities immediate and to develop robust cyber security system to prevent the disruption by attackers with collaboration of all nations state.
Speaking on effect to the environment and climate change on the human life, the Prime Minister said that it is a significant factor which need a global attention.
New mechanism, both civil and military need to be created. Global security needs a global response. Global security challenges emanate from ongoing conflict and threats which may be man- duce or due to natural disasters. We as state need to be prepared for both. States need to cooperate by sharing intelligence, training and knowledges, Mr. Wickremesinghe said.
The Prime Minister said working relationship among security stakeholders, locally and internationally are the keys to success in meeting future security challenges.(Darshana Sanjeewa)

## Title: Sri Lankas first  sanitary landfill in Dompe

Sri Lankas first  sanitary landfill in Dompe
	

Garbage has been an issue not only for Sri Lanka, but for the entire world. The garbage should be utilised in a useful manner, so that it would no longer be a nuisance to the society. It is evident that different countries have come up with productive methods in their efforts to turn waste into resources. In that perspective, Sri Lanka is far behind. 
Sri Lanka generates around 6400 tons of waste per day. 3700 tons of waste are thrown away at road sides. Colombo municipal area alone generates around 700 tons of waste per day. The Sri Lankan Government annually spends roughly around Rs 3 billion on solid waste management. 
Sri Lanka generates around 6400 tons of waste per day
	The Sri Lankan Government annually spends roughly around Rs 3 billion on solid waste management
	Sanitary landfill is a method where municipal solid waste (refuse) on land is subject to controlled disposal
It is noteworthy that the Central Environment Authority (CEA), under the project called Pilisaru, which was introduced as a National Solid Waste Management programme in 2008, is aimed at finding a solution to tackle waste mismanagement. 
Main objectives of Pilisaru
Development of a National Policy on Solid Waste Management (SWM). 
	Development of a National Strategy on SWM. 
	Effective education and awareness for all stakeholders on SWM including training and capacity building. 
	Facilitation for LAS for implementation of SWM projects / programmes. 
	Legal reforms to strengthen effective law enforcement. 
The construction of low cost sanitary landfills for disposing residual waste was a key activity of Pilisaru project. 
What is a sanitary landfill
Sanitary landfills are sites where waste is isolated from the environment until it is safe. The authorities refocus on it when it is considered that the garbage has completely degraded biologically, chemically and physically. 
Sanitary landfill is a method where municipal solid waste (refuse) on land is subject to controlled disposal. The method was introduced in England in 1912; where it is called controlled tipping. 
Waste is deposited in thin layers (up to 1 metre, or 3 feet) and promptly compacted by heavy machinery (e.g., bulldozers). Several layers are placed and compacted on top of each other to form a refuse cell (up to 3 metres, or 10 feet, thick). 
At the end of each day the compacted refuse cell is covered with a layer of compacted soil to prevent odours and windblown debris. 
A landfill comprises systems like Liner system-which is called Leachate collection & treatment system, Cap system- which is Gas recovery system or flaring system and Landscaping- which is Groundwater & gas monitoring system. 
Landfill site at Dompe
The CEA with the technical and financial assistance from the Korean International Corporation Agency (KOICA) introduced the first-ever sanitary landfill in Sri Lanka at Dompe which is a great achievement in terms of utilising waste management. 
The KOICA provided $ 4.5 million as a grant to establish this fully engineered state- of-the-art sanitary landfill in Dompe in the Gampaha District. A commercial forest plantation of Acacia and Pinus in Maligawatte, owned by the Forest Department, was selected as the site for the landfill. 
Speaking to the Daily Mirror, Manager (Operational) Central Environmental Authority Green Park Sanitary Landfill Site Kirindiwela Dompe, U.W.A. Jayathilaka told that the initial programme on the construction of a landfill, was planned in 2009. 
The site was planned to embark in Meepe in 2009. However, we had to shift it elsewhere due to some technical issues and continuous protest by people. 
Then, we selected an area at Dompe as the ideal location for the site. It was not that much easier in Dompe too. At the outset, residents around the Dompe area staged protest marches claiming that putting up such a site, would affect their livelihood in terms because of stench and other environmental issues. 
We were able to convince the people in Dompe that the new technology used for garbage disposal is not related to conventional garbage dumping; where mountains of garbage pile up which in turn encourages public participation for the project in large numbers, Jayathilaka added. 
He said they organised public awareness programmes due to enormous public protests which were against the proposed sanitary landfill site at Dompe. 60 pocket meetings and 8 special Pilisaru Parisara Gammana Programmes were conducted at Dompe area to make the people aware of the advantage of such a site being located at Dompe. 
Pilot project
The first long-term project by the CEA was initiated by constructing a sanitary landfill in Dompe. This pilot project was begun due to emergency needs to dispose garbage using a one hectare land. Although the project was ready for operation in 2009 and the landfill started functioning officially only in 2015 due to public protests in the area. 
Jayathilaka said the landfill site at Dompe was a pilot project which would provide the incentive to generate other landfill stations in Districts such as Puttalam, Jaffna, Anuradhapura, Galle and Polonnaruwa. 
He said that tenders would be called by the end of this year following which construction would commence. The landfills are expected to be put to use by 2020. 
The landfill site has the capacity to take in 25-30 tones of waste per day. It would take 12 years for the pit to completely fill, Jayathilaka said. 

It was first planned to load 90 tones of waste per day. If it was done, the pit would have been filled within six years. In order to make it more productive, we reduced the amount of waste being loaded into the pit, he added. 
He said that the waste collected in six local authorities in the Gampaha District would be used for filling. 
In conclusion, it should be noted that utilising waste materials is not an easy task. It cant be done overnight.
The efforts of the administration are also not enough. It is necessary to have the active support of the general public. If these two parties join, the waste would no longer become waste to the society.

The Manasa that resides in us
	
On my way home after watching Jayantha Chandrasiris Garasarapa a month or so ago, I began to think about the theme at the centre of that film: is demonology really psychology Scholars will contend that there is a fine line to be drawn somewhere between the two and that most if not all those mythical practices we indulge in can be rationalised through modern science. The daha ata sanniya, after all, is a convenient way of explaining the many sicknesses and diseases which invade our body from time to time, while those beings which are said to visit us and make us sick may well be symptoms and products of sleep paralysis (a condition in which we think we are awake, but are actually sleeping and halucinating). Still, the message at the end of Jayanthas film perturbed me: isnt there some sort of a link between what the West has discovered and what the East has prescribed for thousands of years
There must be, but if there is, no one has taken the trouble of ascertaining what it is. To begin with, the methodologies that each civilisation resorts to when it comes to illnesses are more than just a world apart. The West sees ailment in terms of symptom and cure, the East sees it in terms of reason and prevention. The West diagnoses, the East predicts. The West looks towards the short term exit, the East prefers the long term recovery. In this clash of civilisations, there is, I feel, a nexus somewhere. Where it is, we dont rightly know as of yet. That is a tragedy.
Gautama Buddha, in the Sabbe Pruthugjana Ummaththaka of the Mulapariyaya Sutta in the Majjima Nikaya, dwells at length on insanity. Our own civilisation has tabulated mental illnesses in terms of phobias and manias. For instance, melancholia, that most romantic of all forms of depression, is defined as Pitta Unmadaya, while the more disturbing nymphomania is described as Kama Unmadaya. All this goes to show that ours is not a society, as is commonly imagined, that taboos insanity. The reason as to why it has become so stigmatised in this country today has less to do with Buddhism and Sinhala culture than with the culture of a largely urban and middle class hypocrisy which weve for some reason embraced.
Dr. Saman Hettige would agree. The head of the first mental hospital in Sri Lanka based entirely on Ayurveda, he hails from a family of physicians that can be traced to the 19th century. The hospital, Manasa, is located in a suburb in Boralesgamuwa called Neelammahara. Until around 10 years ago, Boralesgamuwa was a veritable green desert, with nothing much to look forward to. Then the roads opened up, and with them the parks, the jogging paths, and the waterways which adorn much of the Colombo-Kesbewa route. Neelammahara has been given a facelift through all these developments and Manasa, which was closeted until then, has finally come out. Before I get to how the hospital operates, therefore, a brief perusal of its history and the history of its founders is called for.
The methodologies that each civilisation resorts to when it comes to illnesses are more than just a world apart. The West sees ailment in terms of symptom and cure, the East sees it in terms of reason and prevention. The West diagnoses, the East predicts.
Hettiges ancestry, as I mentioned earlier, goes back to the 19th century. It all began when Rajadi Rajasinghes physician, Shailindrisinghe Padithuma, left for Dickwella after the annexation of Kandy in 1815. There, one of his sons (Dickwella Sudakshi) vowed to continue the family line, and he kept his vow once he left the South and moved to a barren village in Neelammahara, where he commissioned a temple (the Neelammahara Raja Maha Viharaya). Under that temples watchful gaze, Sudakshi taught Ayurveda to generations of physicians and healers, namely Werahera Sobitha, Arawwala Seelalankara and Dehiwela Dhammaloka. Dhammalokas student was D. S. Hettige, Dr. Samans father. Later, after his gurus death, he thought of building a mental hospital, one which would operate, not on the profit motive, but on the strength of communal bonds. He would get it completed in 1890.
Dr. Saman explains. At the time my father just handed patients over to villagers, to be looked after under his orders. Back then there was a widely shared sense of camaraderie. People looked out for each other. They knew what their friends were doing. But once the Second World War ended and they moved out of the village, they had less time to look after their neighbours. This became a problem, so much so that we were forced to rethink our strategy and turn the place into a conventional hospital.
Was it successful, I ask him. We were surprised at the response. Pretty soon, we went down as one of the first deshiya establishments dedicated to mental illness. Mind you, not just in Asia, but in the whole world as well!
A second glance can help confirm these assertions. Still, having had a look around, I am wary of describing Manasa as a hospital, though Dr. Saman concedes that it is nothing more than that. I also dont agree with his contention that it may be among the worlds first such deshiya institutions (even if we trace its history back to 1890), a point he himself agrees with when he tells me that the late Dr. D.V.J. Harischandra observed and noted tribesmen throughout parts of Africa treating patients relegated as madmen and lunatics by their societies.
As for Manasa itself, suffice it to say that it has grown considerably since its establishment and now has enough room to warrant treatment for around 40 patients. Whats even more commendable, however, is the way these patients are treated.
Whenever it comes to mental illness, the first thing that comes to my mind are those lobotomies and surgeries I associate with hospitals in general. Vindana and Kalpana Ariyawansha, in Premaya Nam, did a commendable job in demolishing these misconceptions and mythical associations. And yet, mental health treatment in the West tends to unnerve me. Remember One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest
On that basis, thankfully, Manasa is a breath of fresh air, since it operates on the principle that each patient has unique characteristics and should not be classified or taken in as a mere statistic. Unlike what is prescribed in the West, we dont isolate those we take in. We always group them. Sure, they can get violent, in which case we have to treat them in isolation. But our rationale is that by getting together, we can dispel most if not all those mental illnesses that beset us. This can even help those who harbour suicidal tendencies.
And its not just local patients that theyve cured. Theyve even treated patients from abroad. Once we admitted the daughter of the Maharaja of Mysore. Shed been to other countries, in the West and East. But we were the ones who treated her really well. As a token of appreciation, we were invited by the Maharaja to Mysore, where at the end of our trip we were gifted with two elephants. One of them, Raja, carried the Daathu Karanduwa at the Kandy Perahera for many, many years.
At this point, Dr. Saman offers some reflections on his field. I ask him as to what demographic suffers the most on account of depression and other serious ailments. He argues that it is the child, adding that it all really boils down to the way we are taught to deal with stress. Its an open secret that we have institutionalised an exam-centred culture here. We pressurise our children until Grade Five over the shishshathvaya and pressurise them even more at their O Levels and A Levels.
This is a well known fact, and for him, it unravels a rift between the individual and his environment. We handle pressure very differently from one another. Regardless of how long we take to recover and adjust, however, the world just keeps on moving. And that is not all: as a people, we cant seem to affirm life anymore.
I suspect that history and tradition might help us here. Dr. Saman agrees. We have a rich civilisation which stems from Buddhism. Take our Jataka stories. They didnt just preach morals, though theyre used to propagate morals today. They also affirmed life. You didnt come across heroes and villains like you do in countless books and films. You came across human beings, flawed, imperfect, and also multifaceted. It was this strange dualism which shaped our people. With contemporary societys obsession over achieving results at any cost, we have, I fear, forgotten that, and in forgetting and abandoning that, we are promoting a culture of rampant self-neglect.
Sangeetha Weeraratne, as the protagonists lover (now grown older) in Garasarapa, argues for a fusion of the West and East when it comes to mental illness. Personally, I dont think such a fusion is impossible, but as of yet, the two ways of looking at the world (the West in terms of prescription, the East in terms of prevention) have spilt over and made themselves so evident that theres precious little we can apart from choosing one over the other. At Manasa, however, you will come across one way of treatment which you will not at most other establishments. It is time to pay a visit, I feel. And not as a patient.

UN expert on debt and human rights visits SL
	
The UN Independent Expert on foreign debt and human rights, Juan Pablo Bohoslavsky, will conduct an official visit to Sri Lanka from 3 to 11 September 2018, at the invitation of the Government, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) said a in a statement.
My visit aims at collecting first-hand information and examine questions related to debt and other financial obligations from a human rights standpoint, said Bohoslavsky. The purpose of the mission is to identify good practices, challenges and potential gaps to be addressed.
An important objective of my visit is to study the effects of public debt and related polices on the full enjoyment of human rights.
I am particularly interested in understanding how human rights standards are integrated in economic policies and examining ongoing reforms and programmes aimed at inclusive growth. I would like to grasp how these measures translate in potential improvements and challenges for the realisation of economic, social and cultural rights. 
During his visit, the Independent Expert will pay specific attention to the incorporation of human rights standards in international development financing, microfinance, and efforts deployed to prevent and combat illicit financial flows in the country.
I look forward to engaging with the authorities of Sri Lanka, civil society, academics, the international community and other relevant stakeholders, Bohoslavsky said.
The Independent Expert will submit a comprehensive report about his visit to the UN Human Rights Council in March 2019.

US naval ship conducts exercise with SL Navy
	
The USS Anchorage- amphibious transport docks- joined the Sri Lankan naval ship Suranimila to conduct an exercise at sea in the Indian Ocean, on August 28, the US embassy in Colombo said today.
The exercise allowed the ships to improve each crews' knowledge and strengthen a wide variety of seamanship skills critical to operating throughout a free and open Indo-Pacific region, it said.
During the exercise, multiple ships sailed in formation to practice communications and maneuvering procedures. In addition to the Anchorage and Suranimila, two landing craft air cushions (LCACs), one AH-1Z Cobra helicopter, and one UH-1Y Huey helicopter participated.
The Sailors and Marines on the USS Anchorage were honored to work with our partners in the Sri Lankan navy during their port visit, said Rear Admiral Brad Cooper, Commander of the Amphibious Force U.S. 7th Fleet. The close teamwork we've seen in this visit, U.S.-Sri Lankan participation in multiple military exercises over the past year, and the hospital ship USNS Mercy's visit to Trincomalee in April reflects our mutual commitment to strengthening the relationship between the U.S. and Sri Lankan militaries.
For the Sailors aboard the Anchorage, it was also a chance to improve their skills with their Sri Lankan counterparts sailing alongside. A part of a growing U.S.-Sri Lanka naval partnership, the at-sea exercise follows the Anchorages theater security cooperation exercise conducted with the Sri Lankan Navy and Navy Marines, the Sri Lankan Navys inaugural participation in the Rim of the Pacific (RIMPAC) exercise that concluded August 2, as well as the Cooperation Afloat Readiness and Training (CARAT) Sri Lanka, held for the first time last year.
The Anchorage team and I had an incredible time in Trincomalee and we are proud to be serving alongside the Sri Lankan Navy, said Captain Dennis Jacko, Commanding Officer of the USS Anchorage. Not only do we increase our proficiency in communications, but we continue to build on a strong and lasting partnership with the Sri Lankan Navy.
