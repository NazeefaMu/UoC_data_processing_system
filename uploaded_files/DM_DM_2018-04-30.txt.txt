A lighthouse that illuminated the path  of Dhamma
	
Ven. Ka<U+1E6D>ukurunde a<U+1E47>ananda Maha Thera
Most Ven. Ka<U+1E6D>ukurunde a<U+1E47>ananda Maha Thera passed away in the early hours of this February 22 at the National Hospital Colombo. The prelate and his teachings  particularly his ground-breaking monograph, Concept and Reality, and the series of Nivane Nivima and Pahan Ka<U+1E47>uva Dharma Desana  hardly need any introduction. Having lived a life of study, meditation, and generous mentorship of generations of disciples in seclusion, shunning publicity, officialism and any private or public ceremonialism, it is challenging a task to talk and write about his life andpassing away.
As if words of commemoration and expressions of respect would intrude on the peace of death, paling away before the silence of cessation, Nirva<U+1E47>a, the venerable was relentlessly pointing at  papanca (prapaca) or proliferation, to borrow from one of the venerables favourite subjects of textual and contemplative scrutiny. 
Yet, on the occasion of Vesak, the observance of the Birth, Awakening and Parinirva<U+1E47>a of the Buddha, it feels apt to rejoice in the practice of one of his modern-day eminent disciples, the Bhikkhu Ka<U+1E6D>ukurunde a<U+1E47>ananda. 
Bhikkhu Ka<U+1E6D>ukurunde a<U+1E47>ananda is well-known for having broken new ground in the Sri Lankan intellectual and meditative landscape of the second half of the twentieth century into the early twenty-first century. He challenged the authoritative Ceylonese Theravada exegesis, stepping out of commentarial orthodoxy. Beyond that, although he never left the Island except for visiting India, his work has been very influential in Western Buddhist academia and among practitioners. 
Two eminent monks have accepted the invitation to recollect their Dhamma encounters with the late Maha Thera. The first voice to be heard is Ven. Uda Eriyagama Dhammajiva, the abbot and Chief Preceptor of Meetirigala Nissarana Vanaya and the second is that of a German-born bhikkhu and scholar, Ven. Analayo. Both monks have been disciples of the late Maha Thera, and have also known each other for over two decades. While today we are publishing the interview with Ven. Dhammajiva we will continue tomorrow with the one of Ven. Analayo. 
Ven.Uda Eriyagama Dhammajiva is a deeply practised meditator and meditation teacher. He ordained as a Buddhist monk thirty years ago (1998), receiving his higher ordination at the Sri Kalya<U+1E47>i Yogasrama Sa<U+1E43>stha, also known as the Galduwa Forest Tradition. Ven.Dhammajiva underwent training under the close guidance of Ven.Matara Sri a<U+1E47>arama Mahathera at Meetirigala Nissara<U+1E47>a Vanaya Forest Monastery. It was this place that saw the original delivery of the late Ka<U+1E6D>ukurunde a<U+1E47>ananda Maha Theras sermons on Nibbana expounded to an audience of meditating monks intent on the attainment of awakening, in this life itself. Between 1988 and 1992 Ven. Dhammajivas mentor was none other than Ven.Ka<U+1E6D>ukurunde a<U+1E47>ananda Maha Thera himself. Ven. Dhammajiva serves as the current abbot of Nissara<U+1E47>a Vanaya and has maintained a close relationship with the late Maha Thera up until the time of the latters passing away. Following are the excerpts of the interview with Ven.Uda Eriyagama Dhammajiva:-
Q When and how did you first come into contact with the late Mahathera
In 1987, maybe in August, soon after resigning from my job, while I was meditating in Nilambe, I came across two books, namely The Seven Stages of Purification and Freed Freedom (still unpublished at that time). Both bore the name of the most Ven. Matara a<U+1E47>arama Maha Thera from Meetirigala, Nissara<U+1E47>a Vanaya. Inspired by the pragmatic and practical way of presentation, it occurred to me to go and meet the venerable. So, together with Dr. Parakrama Fernando and Weerakoon, I visited Nissara<U+1E47>a Vanaya without a prior appointment. Dr. Fernando knew Ven. Ka<U+1E6D>ukurunde a<U+1E47>ananda well. In this first meeting we had a long discussion and I came to know that both the above mentioned books are but his writings.
Q How would Ven. Katukurunde andana relate to and teach his disciples and the younger monks at Nissara<U+1E47>a Vanaya Would you perceive him mostly as a scholar-monk, as a meditating-monk, or as a monastic teacher In which ways would the MahaaThera pass on his knowledge of Dhamma, Vinaya, meditation
One year after I entered Nissara<U+1E47>a Vanaya as a lay meditator, I informed the Sa<U+1E45>gha that I felt ready for ordination and taking up a full-time meditation life. Ven. Matara a<U+1E47>arama sent me to Ven. Ka<U+1E6D>ukurunde a<U+1E47>ananda as one among other candidates. He was not ready to impart teachings in a formal way. Instead, he asked that we candidates read the recommended books and allowed us to visit him for discussion once a week. We had to learn by heart some parts of the texts and he would make some occasional clarifications during these weekly discussions. The venerable Matara a<U+1E47>arama closely observed this process. 
He was serious about the monastic code pertaining to the novice as well as on Pali, the canonical languageof the Suttas.
He was my elder brother in my spiritual life. He readily took responsibilities regarding my life issues too. I used to tell him everything as he instructed without any reservation

One year and nine months later I took higher ordination and, basically, he was my mentor throughout. The procedure was rather informal as it had been earlier with my novice ordination and daily life in the monastery. Clarifications on the Vinaya  the code of rules for fully ordained monastics  were somewhat more of an intrinsic process, more aimed at examining it for the purpose of living the life of a meditating forest monk. The lived forest tradition was often emphasized as opposed to mere book knowledge. 
Q How has the late Mahaa Theras mentorship influenced your spiritual life
It was all about the monk-hood and the Dhamma-Vinaya. That appeared as the only way, without an alternative, for a forest monk inclined to meditation. No one in the monastery would interfere in our relationship, and everyone instead appreciated having such a teacher. Occasionally Godwin Samararatne and others from Nilambe would pay a visit to the Maha Thera, and they would always visit me too. They expressed full appreciation of the way things were happening there. Likewise, I too took this mentorship as a blessing. 

Nissarana Vanaya

QCould you say something about the overall impact of the late MahaaTheras presence and teachings during the years he spent at Nissarana Vanaya and afterwards What was his relationship to the monastic institution
He was my elder brother in my spiritual life. He readily took responsibilities regarding my life issues too. I used to tell him everything as he instructed without any reservation. My brother-in-law passed away and I immediately went to his ku<U+1E6D>i and informed him. He asked me not to start getting into the habit of visiting relatives, even in such a situation, for example. Totally agreed! He asked me to not to make myself exposed unnecessarily to worldly matters. I had no objection to his opinions. Then my mother passed away. Ven. Matara a<U+1E47>arama Maha Thera recommended I take part in the funeral accompanied by my mentor, Ven. Nanananda. He conditioned me, so to say, before visiting my village and covered me over as if guarding me all the way through till the end of the funeral, then took me back and reported the situation to Ven. Matara a<U+1E47>arama Maha Thera as my elder brother. 
Ven. Ka<U+1E6D>ukurunde a<U+1E47>ananda considered the monastic life as precious. If you adhere to it there wont be any unwanted relational or social problem. Life will be
simple as a monk.
 Q In a nutshell, what do you see as the core legacy of the late MahaaThera for present and future generations of monastic and lay practitioners
My understanding of the spiritual life took place and sank in quite gradually with the following key aspects: 1) meditation; 2) strict observance of the monastic rules; 3) least possible amount of worldly activities and avoidance of ceremonies and public events as much as possible; 4) the value of a simple life; 5) an immediate relationship with spiritual friends or teachers. 
During my period of association with the venerable Maha Thera, I could also see his development and improvements due to our interactions and sharing in the monastery. That can be seen when comparing the series of Pahan Ka<U+1E47>uva Desana with the Nivane Nivima Desana. When delivering the sermons on Nivane Nivima, he used to give me the gist of the upcoming sermon just before teaching, and my mind, accordingly, was already prepared for the sermon. Later, having the recordings of the talks and typing them with a typewriter gave me the opportunity of a closer relationship to him. It was a rare thing to have in a monks life like mine. All of these good things were received in actions in the field rather than in classroom lessons of theory. The prelates large array of skills were being transmitted to us in every possible way, and he considered it as a duty to the Sasana.

The books, sermons and his own translations of the Pali Suttas offered abundant wide openings for the future generations, and the untiring way in which he did it was phenomenal. In addition to Pali, Sinhala and English, he was also fluent in Sanskrit and familiar with Madhyama works and Mahayana texts and doctrines elaborating on the key themes of emptiness (sunyata) and proliferation (prapaca) among others. I was lucky enough to witness all closely, even after he left Nissara<U+1E47>a Vanaya. Ven. Analayo and I sometimes joined in sharing the Maha Theras teachings deeply with the help of other available literature as Ven. Analayo was also doing his PhD. 
To conclude, the late Maha Theras leaving Polgasduwa Island Hermitage in 1972 opened a new chapter in the contemporary history of the Theravada tradition, and the Maha Theras departing from Nissara<U+1E47>a Vanaya in 1994 opened the accessibility of his service to the society at large, though it affected his health somewhat badly.

## Title: Buddha introduced mental culture to humanity

Buddha introduced mental culture to humanity
	

What should be directly known is directly known
What should be developed has been developed
What should be abandoned has been abandoned
Therefore, Brahmin, I am a Buddha
(Sela Sutta  Sutta Nipata)
Two hundred and sixty decades ago, the above mentioned unprecedented and unheard of words profoundly resounded and tremendously resonated in our human society. The Master and an extraordinary human being who indefatigably accomplished his incomparable spiritual aspiration firmly assured and resolutely confirmed true nature and the impeccable personality of the Buddha. 
As the aspirant of the Buddha; the Bodhisatta, who enthusiastically sought the ultimate truth, an incomparable noble search was implemented and executed with indefatigable endeavour and indefinable determination till he reached the beacon of the conclusion of the aspiration of his spiritual purpose, the full enlightenment.
Inconceivable challenges and ineffable difficulties were enormous and excessively inundated in his life but he patiently overcame and assiduously conquered them with courage and perseverance. With his unique dedication and paramount persistence he conquered the battle of defilements and impurities; ultimately by treading the Noble Eightfold Path or Path of Purification he attained his spiritual accomplishment, the bliss of Nibbana.
Through many a birth in Samsara, have I wandered in vain, seeking the builder of his house of life. Repeated and continual birth is indeed suffering!
O house-builder, you are seen!
You will not build this house again. For all your rafters broken and your ridge-pole shattered.
My mind has reached the unconditioned! I have attained the destruction of cravings.
(Gouthama Buddha)
This is his foremost statement and profound confirmation soon after he accomplished his Full Enlightenment.
Though we live in a digitally-cultured global society, modern science and nano-technology have failed to make peace of the human mind in our human society. All these boasting achievements and developments have created competitive commercial culture and numerous discordances in our human society today. Profit-based multinational weapon manufacturing companies and multitudes of consumer products business sectors have directed innocent people into a quagmire of mental conflicts and struggles.
Nano technology and Digital Revolution along with proliferation of digital devices have created highly perplexing entanglements in our human society today.
26 centuries ago, the Blessed One explicitly emphasised thus:
A tangle inside, a tangle outside,
This generation is entangled in a tangle
(Samyutta Nikaya)
In his statement, the Blessed One firmly stated that the tangle was the network of craving.
We have encountered innumerable individuals who are infatuated with accumulation of wealth and intoxicated with pursuing treasures. Unfortunately most of them are mentally stressful and sometimes depressed. Some of them have no peace at all. Their marriage lives are in chaos and disorder. Their children are disobedient and insubordinate. Some parents complain about their poor performance of academic work and unruly behaviour. Now increasing of single parent digits are highly escalated. Some partners are terrified and tortured. The prime reason is that most people are mentally bewildered and topsy-turvy. Humane qualities are drastically degraded.
They think that the money, wealth, profit, treasures, status, power, amusement and so on are the life. They have no capacity and ability to understand the importance of humane inner qualities.
Once Gouthama Buddha said thus:
One who, while himself seeking happiness, oppresses with violence other beings who also desire happiness, will not attain happiness hereafter.
Today, emotional disturbances and mental traumas are overflowing.
Unfortunately some members in our human family come to an end with catastrophic conclusion due to their inconceivable agonies. Mental distress, frustration, stress, anxiety, grief, misery, sorrow, despair, depression are widely known and prominent maladies along with numerous afflictions which we daily experience and encounter around the globe today.
The significance of the Buddha Dhamma, the teaching of the Buddha is opening the gateway to find and scrutinize the underlying tendencies of the mind and removing the cloud of ignorance which tremendously covers the human mind. The great Master, the Buddha has prescribed many techniques to apply and train ourselves to win the battle of hidden tendencies. This is why the Buddha Dhamma is widely accepted and globally appreciated in our human society today.
Some may firmly believe that aggressively working and fighting to preserve and protect their nationality and culture is what the Goutama Buddha asked and encouraged us to practise, but none was included in his discourses at all. If someone can understand the fundamental teaching of the Buddha, they would be able to recognise who the Buddha is, and what the Buddha said.
Once, when his disciples assembled, the Buddha precisely emphasised thus;
Bhikkhus, there are these four means of sustaining a favourable relationship.
What four Giving, endearing speech, beneficent conduct, and impartiality. These are four means of sustaining a favourable relationship.
Unfortunately, many people have completely forgotten the authentic approach to find the true peace and innermost happiness that the great Master, Gouthama Buddha compassionately asked to achieve. There are numerous unacceptable and disgraceful activities that are visible in the vicinity of the island of the Dhamma and political movements are gravely apparent and undeniable in our society today. These provocative pursuits will constantly lead and create a very violent and hostile environment in our peaceful society. 
People speak and express their personal views about their own so called cultures. Some of them are in a battle field to make their own superior to another. Even some religious groups struggle to place the superior ones own in some other part in the world today. 
Unfortunately, they never focus on their own mentality and inward condition. After a long period of time, by achieving his ultimate spiritual aspiration the Blessed One declared that the best was the mental culture. Mentally cultured people never suffer from defilement and they are not shaken by any vicissitude of life.
Once the Goutama Buddha was asked by an earth-bound deity (deva) who dwelt in the forest, each day he would see monks who inhabited the forest sitting in meditation after their meal. As they sat their minds would become unified and serene, and the serenity of their minds would become manifest in their complexions. Puzzled that they could have such serene faces while living under these austere conditions, the deva came to the Blessed One to inquire into the cause.
Those who dwell deep in the forest,
Peaceful, leading the holy life,
Eating but a single meal a day:
Why is their complexion so serene
They do not sorrow over the past,
Nor do they hanker for the future,
They maintain themselves with what is present,
Hence their complexion is so serene.
(Samyutta Nikaya)
Unfortunately, the deplorable and distressing fact is that individual branded credos and dogmas are proliferated and multiplied in the name of the Buddha Dhamma.
No authority in the community of the Buddhist monks or responsible government to take any decisive and conclusive action to protect and preserve true doctrine and discipline (Dhamma Vinaya).
The quality and standard of the monk-hood has been drastically changed. Many monks have embraced and engaged in party politics. The life style, the way of life, behaviour as a disciple of the Buddha, deportment of monkhood, duties and responsibilities as a monk is completely disappeared and absent in certain individuals.
Unacceptable behaviour and disgraceful acts of so called monks lead drastically changed peoples respectful attitudes and deep rooted devotion. The way they speak and express their antagonistic ideas and inimical views is completely dangerous and catastrophic. Our future generation will be in vulnerable situation and true spiritual practice will dramatically disappear.
The Buddha declared that Vinayo Naama Sasanassa Aayu Discipline is the lifespan of the dispensation of the Buddha. Numerous well-disciplined and well trained monks have guided our Buddhist community with outstanding examples but now it is in topsy-turvy. 
The current propensity and inconceivable proclivity in the Sinhala Buddhist community around the globe is indescribable. Listening to multitudes of sermons and taking part in meditation programmes are widely spread and fast growing cult of personality.
Antagonism and animosity is the burning issue in the globe today. World recognized organizations indefatigably work hard to implement and execute numerous programmes to resolve and to find the solid and long-lasting solution to this smouldering matter of contention.

Until we accept the inner failure and start with fresh thoughts of loving kindness and compassion, no one can reach the destination of unity and harmony.
Craving for political power is the virus in our country today. They horrendously and unwisely provoke innocent people towards violence, conflicts and discord. So called unwise leaders implant disharmony and hostility in the hearts of many people. 
If the Buddhists cannot be harmonious and united, how will they be in harmony and in unison with other nationalities and races and what they preach others to do so
Be wise to set aside disparity, diversity and differences. We should wholeheartedly appreciate and accept the similarities and conformities of others with compassion and understanding.
He who is friendly
amidst the hostile,
Peaceful amidst the violent,
And unattached amidst the attached
Him do I call a Holy man
(Gouthama Buddha)

Depreciation of rupee affects private bus industry: Gemunu
	
The Lanka Private Bus Owners' Association (LPBOA) today demanded at least a 10 percent of bus fare hike following the depreciation of the rupee against the US dollars.
Speaking to the Daily Mirror, LPBOA Chairman Gemunu Wijeratne said the depreciation of rupee had direct impact on the private bus operators.
Due to the depreciation of the rupee, maintenance cost of buses have gone up. This has a direct impact on the prices of spare parts and the import price of bus units. he said.
Bus tyres, tubes, engine oil, spare parts and even the import prices of a bus had been increased, he said.
Government should take measures to control the situation or otherwise should be allowed to increase bus fares with immediate effect, he said.
When importing buses, a price of a unit had been increased by Rs.150,000 or Rs.200,000, he said.
Annual bus fare increment would be calculated by the National Transport Commission (NTC)and it will be announced on July 1st annually. Mr. Wijeratne said that he hoped the annual fare revision will be calculated after considering the depreciation of rupee value.(Chaturanga Samarawickrama)

Discourse on outcasts Vasala Sutta - The story of Aggika Bharadvaja
	
On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Devram Vehera near Shravasthi. At that time a fire had been lit in the house of Brahmin Bharadvaja and a burnt offering was being prepared. The Blessed one came close to the place of offering. The Brahmin who got angry when he saw the Blessed one abused Him in the language of outcasts and threatened Him to stay where He was and not tocome closer.
The Blessed One spoke to the Brahmin and enquired from him whether he was aware who an outcast was and the circumstances under which onebecomes an outcast.
It occurred to Brahmin Aggika Bharadvaja that The Blessed One knew something more than what he himself knew and that he should realize the conditions which make one an outcast. 
He said May I please request the Venerable Gautama to preach Dhamma to enable me to know who an outcast is and the conditions which make one an outcast
The Blessed One then addressed the Brahmin,Listen then Brahmin attentively, I shall tell you 
Yes venerable sir Brahmin Aggika Bharadvaja said and expressed his willingness to listen to the Blessed One and the Blessed One explained to the Brahmin the conditions which make one an outcast.
 If a person gets angry very often, cherishes hatred, does not like to speak well of others (reluctant to appreciate the worth of others), behaves in a way which is not moral and acceptable and who is deceitful, identify such a person as an outcast.
If a person in this world kills a living being , once born or twice born and who has no sympathy on living beings identify such a person as an outcast. If a person besieges and destroys villages and hamlets and becomes a notorious criminal identify such a person as an outcast. Whether in the village or in the forest if a person steals the belongings of others, takes whatever is not given by the owners, identify such a person as an outcast. 
If a person gets indebted to some other party and absconds or escapes saying I am not indebted to that party identify such a person as an outcast. If a person being covetous kills a person walking on the road and robs him identify such a person as an outcast. If a person gives false evidence as a witness for his own sake or for the sake of others or for the sake of wealth identify such a person as an outcast. If a person associates with the spouses of relatives or friends by force or with mutual consent identify such a person as an outcast. If a person who is wealthy enough does not look after his parents identify such a person as an outcast. If a person assaults his mother, father, brothers, sisters or in- laws identify such a person as an outcast.  If when questioned about some matter a person says deceitfully something harmful or detrimental to others and talks in an evasive manner identify such a person as an outcast. If a person who has committed an evil act takes action to keep that act a secret and thereby commits further sins identify such a person as an outcast. If a person who goes to someone elses house and enjoys food and luxuries does not entertain the others when they visit his place identify such a person as an outcast. If a person deceives Brahmins, ascetics or any other mendicant by uttering lies excessively identify such a person as an outcast. If a person does not offer meals to a Brahmin or ascetic who appears during meal time but accuses and angers him by using harsh words identify such a person as an outcast. 
By birth is not one an outcast, by birth is not one a Brahmin, by deed is one an outcast by deed is one a Brahmin
If a person shrouded with ignorance speaks harsh or false words with a view to gain something identify such a person as an outcast. If a person due to excessive pride and prejudice exalts himself and belittles others identify such a person as an outcast. If a person angers others, is avaricious cherishes base desires, selfish, deceitful and has no ear or shame for sins identify such a person as an outcast. If a person reviles the Enlightened One, a disciple of the Buddha, a recluse or a house holder identify such a person as an outcast. If a person who is not an Arahant pretends to be an Arahant he is a thief in the Universe with gods and Brahmas identify such a person as an outcast.
By birth is not one an outcast, by birth is not one a Brahmin, by deed is one an outcast by deed is one a Brahmin. An example can be cited to show that one is not an outcast by birth. Sopaka who was the son of an outcast came to be known as Maganda, he who was born to an outcast family gained the highest fame and many kshastriyas (warriors) and Brahmas came to attend to him. 
Sopaka who was ordained gave up passions and mounted the celestial chariot  the noble Eight fold path and reached the Brahma realm.
His birth in a so called outcast family but it did not stand on his way to the Brahma realm. There are Brahmas born in the families of preceptors, kinsmen of (Veda) hymns who often command sins.
They who are despised in the previous birth are born again in an evil state of existence. High birth cannot prevent them from the evil state or being despised. By birth is not one an outcast, by birth is not one a Brahmin. By deed or karma one becomes a Brahmin or an outcast.
When Buddha said thus Brahmin Aggika Bharadvaja exclaimed,O! Gautama, your teaching is superb!

## Title: PEACE IN KOREAS - REALITY OR PIPE DREAM

PEACE IN KOREAS - REALITY OR PIPE DREAM
	
On Friday, April 27, at the Truce Village of Panmunjom in the demilitarized zone, the two Korean leaders - North Koreas President Kim Jong Un and South Korean President Moon Jae In - held an historic meeting to discuss ways of bringing peace to the Korean peninsula. 
North and South Korea have been divided since the end of the Korean War in July 1953, when an armistice was signed by US Lt. Gen. Harrison Jr. on behalf of United Nations Command (UNC) and North Korean General Nam II representing the Korean Peoples Army (KPY) and the Chinese Peoples Volunteer Army (PVA) to bring about a complete cessation of hostilities until a final peace settlement was achieved on the peninsula. 
The armistice among many other points mandated neither side introduce new weapons into Korea except for piece-for-piece replacement. The armistice also established a demilitarised zone which divided the Korean peninsula into two states, despite Korea having been a united entity for thousands of years. Additionally the Armistice Agreement called for a conference to be held within three months of the signing of the agreement in order to ensure the peaceful settlement of the Korean question. After numerous delays the conference was finally held in Geneva, Switzerland in April 1954. 
At that conference Chinese Premier (then FM) Zhou Enlai suggested a peace treaty be drawn up to bring hostilities on the peninsula to an end. Sadly, the US opposed the proposal and a peace treaty has never been drawn up. 
In January1958the U.S. unilaterally abrogated the section regarding the non- introduction of new weapons into Korea. It began deploying nuclear armed Honest John missiles, 280mm atomic cannons and cruise missiles with a capacity to hit China and Russia into South Korea. 
The meeting between the two Korean leaders on April 27, 2018 is thus an attempt to take the future of Korea into the hands of the Korean people and finally end the war and unite the Korean peninsula which is being kept divided by foreign interests. The two leaders also agreed on the need to rid their peninsula of nuclear weapons. 
The meeting signifies, hopefully for the Korean people, the will of its leadership to put an end to foreign interference in what is basically a Korean issue and formulate a home-grown solution to issues which are keeping their people apart. 
The special mention denuclearising of the peninsula is not something that will go down well with the US. The introduction of nuclear missiles by the US, into the Korean peninsula despite the armistice agreement was not for the benefit of the Korean people. At that time, the US was the big nuclear power in the world, with the Soviet Union carrying out its first nuclear test only on August 29, 1949! The introduction of atomic/nuclear weapons into the Korean peninsula was simply a means of continuing and furthering US hegemonic designs in the Asia Pacific area and an attempt to intimidate China and the then Soviet Union whom it saw as its rivals in the region. 
North Koreas nuclear programme began in the late 1970s and was a response to the introduction of US nuclear armaments into the peninsula. North Korea looks on its nuclear arsenal as a means of securing its national security. The continued US denunciation of North Koreas nuclear programme and atomic weapons, is more an effort to cover the Original Sin committed by the US through having unilaterally abrogated the Armistice Agreement and nuclearizing the Korean peninsula. 
After all, though the US claims to fear nuclear weapons in the hands of so-called mad men, It is the US alone, which used nuclear weapons as a weapon of war. 
It is unrealistic to expect North Korea to unilaterally dismantle its nuclear programme without a sense of security, an improvement in US-N Korea relations, the elimination of the US nuclear umbrella over South Korea and withdrawal of US nuclear weapons from the peninsula. Given the US interests in the region it is difficult to see the US agreeing to North Koreas conditions. The reality is the US will block all acts running counter to its selfish interests, however justiciable they may be.

SLTDA to register Mirissa hoteliers this week
	
The Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority (SLTDA) today said that it would launch a mobile registration campaign to register hoteliers in Mirissa this week.
The SLTDA said the registration will be done according to the provisions of the SLTDA Act and said a team of SLTDA officials would visit the hoteliers.
A spokesman from the SLTDA told Daily Mirror that for those who failed to meet standards of regulatory process due to justifiable reasons, temporary registration can be obtained.
He said the SLTDA would collect the hoteliers data and create a data base and immediate license would be given for those who posses a valid trade license with clear financial statements.
Meanwhile, the SLTDA said it would seek legal advises from the Attorney Generals Department regarding the hoteliers who are unable to fulfill the SLTDA requirements.
The SLTDA said it would individually attend to those cases and review their facilities before registering them with the authority.
The SLTDA strictly implemented and enforced the regulations over the hoteliers after a group of Dutch tourists were assaulted in Mirissa on April 8.
Minister of Tourism Development and Christian Religious Affairs John Amaratunga raised concerns of the tourists security and instructed the officials to regulate the registration process of the hoteliers in Mirissa following the tragic incident. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

To live a pure unselfish life, one must count nothing as ones own in the midst of abundance.   -
	

Dammachakka pawathwana Suttha is the first and the foremost sermon delivered by The Buddha after His Enlightenment, to his old colleagues, five ascetics at Migadaya, Isipathana, Baranasa presently Known as Varanasi for purpose of achieving liberation by ending the suffering in the circle of life (samsara). The most essential teaching of The Buddha regarding the truth of the world is encapsulated therein and it denotes a Setting in Motion the Wheel of Truth. It contains four noble truths as follows;


1. Dukka-ariyasacca  The truth of suffering
2. Dukkasamudaya-ariyasacca  The origin of arising suffering
3. Dukkanirodha-ariyasacca  The cessation of suffering
4. Dukkanirodhagamini patipada-ariyasacca  The way leading to the cessation of suffering
1. Dukka-ariyasacca  The noble truth of suffering
In Pali text dukka means a suffering arising out of incapability of satisfying or not being able to bear or withstand something. But dukka is neither pessimistic nor optimistic, but realistic. 
It means damma is a realistic view of both the life and the world in an objective manner (yathabutham).Dukka is superficially understood as suffering, sorrow, misery, pain etc. But it has a deeper philosophical meaning such as imperfection, impermanence, insubstantiality etc. It appears that there is no proper English term equivalent to the term dukka in Pali.
The opposite of dukka is suka, which means happiness, Joy, ecstasy and it includes both material and spiritual.It teaches as to how one falls into dukka through attachments and on other hand how to achieve suka through detachments. 
Dukka arises as a result of Aniccadukkaparinama dhammawhich includes three important factors, namely;
i. Assad  attraction or enjoyment 
ii. Adeenawa - evil consequence or anger or insatiability 
iii. Nissarana  freedom or liberation. 
Dukkaas taught by The Buddha could be viewed from three aspects.
i. Duka-dukka  ordinary suffering
ii. Viparinama-dukka  dukka originated as a result of a change
iii. Samkara-dukka  dukka as a result of conditioned states Duka-dukka
It includes both the physical and mental suffering which are denominated into eight categories;
jathipidukka, jarapidukka, vyadipidukka, maranampidukka, apriyehisampayogodukka, piyehivippayogadukka, yamkinchannalabathithampi dukka, sankichchenapanchaupadanakkanda dukka
All the sufferings of human beings are caught up in one or more of the categories referred to above and they could be summarized as follows;
i. Jathipidukka - dukka as a result of the birth
ii. jarapidukka- dukka as a result of becoming old
iii. vyadipidukka- dukka as a result of sickness
iv. maranampidukka- dukka as a result of death
v. apriyehisampayogodukka - dukka as a result of association of unwholesome persons
vi. piyehivippayogadukka - dukka as a result of distancing from loved ones
vii. yamkinchannalabathi thampidukka - dukka as a result of not receiving desired things
viii. sankichchenapan chaupadanakkandadukka - five aggregate themselves are dukka(chaththarimahabhuthani)Viparinama-dukka
Every being as well as objects are subject to constant change as a matter of universal law. Such change always brings sorrow and pain.
Samkara-dukka
Conditioned state has a greater philosophical meaning. Being I only an individual but factually I means only a combination of five aggregates (panchaskanda) and mental force.The attachments to these aggregates themselves produce only dukka. 
Five aggregates could be briefly summarized in the following manner;
i. Rupaskanda  aggregate of matters
Being is formed with four great elements (chaththarimahabbhuthani) which means solidity (apo), fluidity (thejo), heat (vayo), motion (patavi). Five material sense organs are made in that include eye, ear, nose, tongue and body. They make the following senses;
Mind and five aggregates are not independent, but inter-dependent as matters are conceived through physical organs

Eye  visible form Ear  sound form
Nose  odour form Tongue  taste/gustatory form
Body  tangible form Mind  mind objects
All realms of matter include in five aggregates of matters and the conception or idea are in the sphere of mind which is called dharmayathana.
ii. Vedanaskanda - aggregate of sensation
Sensations are of three categories: 
1. Pleasant sensation
2. Unpleasant sensation
3. Neutral sensation
When the physical contact with the external world communicates with the mental organ, a sensation is formed. Those contacts with the external world are done by the said matters or objects which carry this sensation to the mind. Mind and five aggregates are not independent, but inter-dependent as matters are conceived through the physical organs. 
iii. Sannaskanda - aggregate of perception
Perceptions are originated as a result of six faculties do contact with the external world. It may either be physical or mental.
iv. Sankaraskanda  aggregate of mental formation
All volitional activities both good and bad are included in this mantle formation. Since the mind commands in the sphere of all good or bad or neutral acts, it would be considered as volitional or karma. But sensation or perception are not volitional actions which would produce karmic actions. Volitional actions produce the following karmic actions. 
Manasikara  attention
Chanda  will
Adhimokka  determination
Sraddha  confidence
Samadhi  concentration
Panna  wisdom
Viriya  energy
Raga  desire 
Patiga  hatred 
Avijja  ignorance
Mana  conceit
v. Vinnanaskanda  aggregate of consciousness
When the said five physical faculties correspond with the external world, the mind perceives in visible, sound, odour, taste and tangible form enabling the mind to recognizes them and form consciousness. The mind with its experience recognize the nature of a thing or a person. What is perceived by the mind as only a conventional truth but not an ultimate truth. For example, I or you is in existence of an individual in the context of conventional truth. But in ultimate truth, there is no such existence. In other words, existence of a person is only a designation, but is not in reality.
2. Dukkasamudaya-ariyasacca  The origin of arising dukka
There are three kinds of desires or cravings which originate dukka and could be described as follows; .
i. Craving for sensual pleasure (kamathanha)
ii. Craving for becoming/existence (bhava thanha)
iii. Craving for non-existence (vibhavathanha)
The desire or greed or craving leads to all forms of sufferings and the continuity of a being. Sufferings are originated not in isolation but from aggregates which are of inter-dependence. The condition of the circle of beings is described as Conditional Genesis (paticcasamuppada). Dukka is a result of defilements and impurities (kileshasasawa dharma) in addition to the root cause of greed. 
The desire does not limit to attachment to sense pleasure such as wealth and power, but also a desire for attachment to ideas, views, opinions, beliefs, etc. (dhammathanha). All conflicts commencing from a domestic unrest to a world war arrise out of selfishness and desire. Gouthama Buddha preached to Rattapala Thero unolokoathithothanhadaso which means the world lacks and hankers and is enslaved to thirst.
There are four nutriments (ahara) in the sense of cause or condition necessary for the existence and continuity of beings.They are;
a. Kabalinkarahara  ordinary material food
b. Passahara  contact of sense/organs with the external world
c. Vinnanahara  consciousness 
d. Manosancetahara  mental volition or will 
Mental volition is the one which leads to exist or to re-exist or to become and so on. All good karma (kusala) yields good effect while bad karma yields bad effects. All good and bad karma come within the cycle of continuity (samsara). 
3. Dukkanirodha-ariyasacca  The cessation of dukka
There is a path for emancipation or liberation from suffering and from continuity. One must realize the reality in life to attend the said liberation called Nibbana. Then all suffering comes to a cessation. In short, it is an extinction of thirst.

Dhammachakkapawaththana sutta says chakkunudapadi  gnanamudapadi  vijjaudapadi  panna udapadi and alokoudapadi. It means that when one reaches a state of full realization of the truth, it amounts to the dawning of immaculate vision, profound intelligence, insightful knowledge, unfathomable wisdom and exalted enlightenment. 
The extinction of desire (ragakayo), the extinction of hatred (dosakkayo), the extinction of illusion (mohakayo), pave the way for uprooting attachment, the cutting off of continuity, the extinction of thirst and finally leads to the cessation of suffering which means Nibbana. In almost all religions, summumbonum can be attained only after the death, but in Buddhism Nirvana could be realized in this very life.
4. Dukkanirodhag aminipatipada-ariyasacca  The way leading to cessation of suffering
This is known as majjamapatipada which means the middle path as it avoids two extremes of happiness (kamasukallikanuyoga) and self-mortification (aththakilamathanuyoga). The middle path discovered by The Buddha is called the Noble Eight-fold Path (arya-attangika-magga) as it has been encapsulated of eight categories which are to be disciplined through three ethical disciplines called sila (ethical conduct), samadhi (mental discipline), panna (wisdom) in the following manner;
Sila (ethical conduct)
1. Sammavacha  right speech
2. Sammakammantha  right action
3. Sammaajeewa  right livelihood
samadhi (mental discipline)
4. Sammavayama  right effort
5. Sammasathi  right mindfulness
6. Samma samadhi  right concentrationpanna (wisdom)
7. Sammaditti  right understanding
8. Sammasankappa  right thought
Buddha has admonished the manner in which these principles should be practised for the purpose of achieving the ultimate goal,the Nirvana. 
The knowledge on the four noble truths is only a mere understanding, it needs a deep intellectual capacity to grasp things in their real terms which is called anubhutha. When one penetrates into the deep understanding it is called pativedha. In simple terms it means seeing a thing in its true nature without prefixed name or label, one could realize the true nature of life and the world. The path leading towards the realization of ultimate reality is laid through self-purification and spiritual and intellectual perfection.

Wont let canteen, hotel owners to raise food prices: CAA
	
The Consumer Affairs Authority (CAA) said it would not permit canteen and hotel owners to increase prices of food items in the wake of the recent increase in the price of gas.
Last week the price of a 12.5 kg cylinder of Litro gas and Laugfs Gas was increased by Rs.245 resulting in a cylinder of gas now costing Rs.1,676.
The Canteen Owners Association (COA) said on Sunday the price of a packet of lunch would be increased by Rs.10 and that of a hopper by Rs.2.
The CAA said the price of a cylinder of gas in 2014 was Rs.2,441 and in January 2015 when this government assumed office the price was Rs.1,896 which was reduced by Rs.564.
However, in September 2017, the price of a 12.5 kg cylinder of gas was increased by Rs.110.
As such, when compared with gas prices in 2014, canteen and hotel owners have no reason to increase the price of food items, CAA Chairman Hasitha Thilakaratne said and added that milk powder companies had asked that they be allowed to increase the prices of imported full cream milk powder.
He said the Cabinet sub committee would take a decision on this matter.(Darshana Sanjeewa)
