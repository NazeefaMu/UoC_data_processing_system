Govt. procurement streamlined
	
President Maithripala Sirisena has appointed a five-member committee chaired by Daya Liyanage, to make recommendations for a new procurement mechanism with a view to rationalising the government's procurement process.
Mr. Liyanage was formerly deputy secretary to the Treasury and former chairman of the National Procurement Agency.
The National Procurement Commission (NPC) to be set up under the 19th Amendment will hereafter be the sole authority for procuring stationery, vehicles, computers, photocopy machines and office equipment including furniture and in future individual state institutions will not be allowed to make such purchases.
The Cabinet paper presented by President Sirisena states that the bulk purchases will be more economical when compared with the present practice of purchasing them in smaller quantities.
?A large amount of money, allocated under capital or recurrent expenditure annually, except debt repayment, is spent either for construction under various development projects and for buying equipment by government institutions,? the President said.
The entire procurement process including the purchase of goods and services by government institutions under capital and recurrent expenditure as well as the purchase of petroleum by the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation is carried out in compliance with the provisions contained in the ?Government Procurement Guidelines? issued in 2006.
According to ?Government Procurement Guidelines, President Sirisena said several procurement committees and technical evaluation committees have to be set up for the purchase of goods and services when it could be done through a single procurement committee.
"There is an ample scope for avoiding unnecessary expenses and waste, frauds and irregularities by rationalizing and easy monitoring of the procurement process," the President said.
The President said he and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe were of the opinion that a more efficient and effective procurement mechanism should be introduced to replace the current procurement process
Other members of the Commiittee are -- former ministry secretary and former deputy treasury secretary Lalith R. de Silva; former ministry secretary Dharani S. Wijayatilake former additional ministry secretary and former director general of the public finance deprtment, W.D. Jayasinghe. The Director General of the Department of Public Finance will act as Convener / Secretary to the Committee. (Sandun A Jayasekera)

Over 900 complaints to PRECIFAC: Secretary
	
The Presidential Commission of Inquiry to Investigate and Inquire into Serious Acts of Fraud, Corruption as Abuse of Power, State Resources, and Privileges (PRECIFAC) had received 900 complaints with regard to frauds and acts of corruption while 250 of them had been forwarded to the investigation unit for reference, its secretary Lacille De Silva said yesterday.
Mr. De Silva said 50 complaints out of the 250, which had been referred to the commission?s investigation unit, were being investigated.
He requested the people to forward their complaints with regards to frauds and corruption that occurred between 2010 and 2015 to the Secretary, PRESIFAC, Colombo -07.
He said the commission had been conducting investigations into these cases for the past three months and that it was not an easy task to investigate allegations of fraud and corruption when the relevant officials do not cooperate with the officials of the investigation team.
?Our investigation officials have to get over many obstacles to get to the facts when investigating allegations of fraud and corruption as the relevant officials are hesitant when asked to cooperate with them just as in the case where an army official was found to have lied before the commission when giving evidence,? he said.(Ajith Siriwardana)

Probes on fraud, corruption will continue: PM
	
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has said that investigations into allegations of corruption and fraud against ministers and MPs of the Rajapaksa regime would not be stopped despite some of them being appointed ministers of the present government.
Responding to a question raised by Parliamentarians of the United National Front for Good Governance (UNFGG) at a workshop held for the new Parliamentarians on Thursday at the Parliamentary Complex Mr. Wickremesinghe had said that those who had plundered the wealth of the people would not be spared and no one would be allowed to use their portfolios as shields to cover up their misdeeds or escape punishments.
The Prime Minister asserted that the institutions set up to take action against those who had been involved in corruption and abuse of public properties would be strengthened and a Bill that would bring the FCID and the Bribery Commission in par with similar institutions in the US and UK would be introduced in Parliament on September 22.

Speaker to decide on request made by parties in UPFA
	
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya will meet the leaders of the political parties aligned with the United People?s Freedom Alliance (UPFA) to take a final decision on their requests for recognition as separate political parties in Parliament, officials said yesterday.
The official said the discussions would also include their participation in the parliamentary business committee meetings and the assignment of seats in the front row of the Chamber.
UPFA Vice President Dinesh Gunawardane told Daily Mirror that their requests were conveyed by him and other opposition party leaders at a meeting on Thursday. He said the Speaker had agreed to have another meeting next week before arriving at a final decision.
Mr. Gunawardane, who is also the leader of Mahajana Eksath Peramuna (MEP), said some of the UPFA members would sit in the Opposition though the party had joined the National Unity Government.
?Numerically, this group is larger than the number of the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) and the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) parliamentarians. Therefore, this UPFA group has to be given due recognition,? he said. (Kelum Bandara)
