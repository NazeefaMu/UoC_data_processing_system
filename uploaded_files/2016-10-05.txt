He has now set his sights on a place in world politics
	
?
A politico from the South holding a key portfolio in yahapalanaya who has reportedly grown sick of party politics in the country has set his heart on securing a high post in a world organization, they say.?
?
This politico who entered national politics from an electorate bordering River Nilwala has since then held high office under regimes led by both main political parties during his 27-year political career.
He has told his colleagues that his views ware too liberal and too independent to suit party politics in this country and he could be much more comfortable and productive in a position in the world political scene.
By the way, certain statements this politico made in the recent past sparked off much controversy and drew much flak from the Sinhala extremists in particular.?
The portfolio the politico is holding now is an ideal stepping stone to the high office in the world organization he is said to be seeking.

Land for investments: Cabinet on balance
	
The Government yesterday sought Cabinet approval to do away with the charge imposed on land purchases by foreigners on 99 year lease for investments in the country, it is learnt.
However, the Cabinet Paper submitted in this regard was deferred as some Ministers said it should be done only on conditions stipulated for foreign investors, intending to purchase land.
They said the amount of money to be invested, and the number of employment opportunities to be created were factors to be considered before granting any concession of this nature.
Currently, a charge of 15 percent is levied on the market value of lands to be purchased on lease-hold basis by foreign nationals.
The Cabinet Paper will be considered later. (Kelum Bandara)

A heated argument was witnessed in Parliament yesterday when a government minister was verbally confronted by the government ally United National Party ( UNP), Joint Opposition and the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna ( JVP) after he objected to an oral question.
The Minister, Faizer Mustapha who objected to an oral question raised by UNP MP Chaminda Wijesiri on an alleged act of fraud by Uva Chief Minister.
?There have been no fraud reported. The member should settle his personal matters with the chief minister without raising questions to insult him" Mr Mustapha said.
Minister Kabir Hashim who raised an objection said the minister has no right to raise objections about an oral question. ?The Minister is bound by the standing orders to answer oral questions and therefore he has no right to object" he said.
Leader of the Joint Opposition group Dinesh Gunawardane said the Minister should not violate the right of MPs to raise oral questions
MP Wimal Weerawansa said the Minister is acting in this manner as he is appearing for the Chief Minister in a Court case.
Mr. Mushpaha who shot back said he is not involved in any incident concerning the Chief Minister though he is appearing for the case.
Chief Opposition Whip Anura Kumara Dissanayake said the question was about a robbery. "When you raise a question about a robbery it is obvious that you have to call the person you are accusing a rogue," he said alleging that the Minister is trying to cover-up the charges against the Chief Minister.?

The Ratnapura Municipal Council has informed that it is unable to release the Seevali Grounds for the joint opposition rally on Saturday, UPFA MP Pavithra Wanniarachchi said.
She said the decision was regrettable because all preparations had been made for the public rally.
?The Municipal Commissioner has not given any reason for making such a decision. All he said was that the grounds cannot be released,? the MP told Daily Mirror and added that the rally would now have to be held near the Ratnapura Clock Tower.
She said all JO MPs including Dinesh Gunawrdena, Vasudeva Nanayakkara, Wimal Weerawansa, Udaya Gammanpila and the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) MPs who support former president and MP Mahinda Rajapaksa were expected to attend the rally.
When contacted by Daily Mirror, Municipal Commissioner M.W. Kulathilaka said a decision had been taken by the Council previously not to release the grounds for any political rallies as it would damage the grounds which had been developed for holding sports events.
?The Council has made a decision not to allow any political rally, musical show or other rallies which would damage the Seevali grounds. However, only state functions would be permitted there," he said.
Meanwhile, he said an area where lorries were parked has been provided as an alternative. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Cabinet Spokesman and Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne today asked whether Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara had 'pittu' in his mouth when he was serving in the Rajapaksa Government.
He accused the sports minister of seeking cheap publicity by publicly claiming there were crooked and corrupt ministers in the unity government.
Responding to a journalist at yesterday?s cabinet news briefing about the remarks made by the sports minister, Dr. Senaratne asked where Mr. Jayasekara was when the entire country and the global community were accusing the Rajapaksa regime of fraud and corruption and other crime.
?He should have discussed and resolved these matters at Cabinet meetings and spoken of them in public if there was no positive response to his grievances. I must say that I myself and ministers like Champika Ranawaka always raised many issues in the Cabinet of the previous government and even clashed with President Rajapaksa on many occasions. We discussed them in the open when there was no positive response to our grievances,? Dr. Senaratne said.

The lady representing the country?s chief executive at the apex of the council?s administration too had given her sanction to this foreign tour.
Asked why she had given her approval for this foreign trip, the lady had stated that she saw no reason to object to it, because the provincial chief assured that the country?s chief executive himself had Okayed it. ?However, it had transpired later that the Big Boss knew nothing about the planned foreign tour and following this revelation the lady had reproved the provincial chief for obtaining her approval under false pretenses.

CIMA seminar sheds light on proposed tax revisions
	
?Chartered Institute of Management Accountants (CIMA) organised a seminar on the recent development in value-added tax (VAT) and other taxes recently at the CIMA auditorium. The presentation on the tax bills issued was delivered by KPMG Tax and Regulatory Principal Suresh I. Perera.
There are several bills that have been issued such as VAT, Nation Building Tax (NBT), Ports and Airport Development Levy and Land (Restrictions on Alienation) Act. ?
The VAT Bill issued dated September 13, 2016 contains the proposed changes to the rate of VAT, general threshold, threshold for wholesale and retail, limitation in certain exemptions, etc.
The VAT rate as per the bill will be 15 percent from the date of passing the act. The bill explains that during the period from May 2 to July 11, the VAT rate would be 15 percent, while from the date of July 11 to the date of passing the act the rate applicable would be 11 percent.?
The significance of the date July 11 - that has been referred to in the bill - is the date the court issued the judgment in relation to the petition filed against the VAT amendments.
The general threshold has been reduced from Rs.3.75 million per quarter to Rs.3 million per quarter and the same is with effect from April 1, 2016.?
The wholesale and retailers threshold will be Rs.12.5 million per quarter post the passing of the VAT Act. There seems to be ambiguity as to the threshold applicable for wholesale and retailers from May 2, 2016 to July 11, 2016.?
However, post-July 11, 2016 and up to the date of enactment, the threshold applicable for wholesale and retail trade will be Rs.100 million per quarter, similar to the threshold applicable from January 1, 2015 to May 2, 2016.
The VAT amendment in 2014 introduced the concept of ?deemed VAT? with regard to persons supplying both liable products and exempt products.?
The concept was to compel the supplier to pocket out VAT in relation to that part of the exempt supplies, which is over and above the 25 percent of the total supplies. The web notice suspended the provisions in relation to deemed VAT from January 1, 2016 but the bill suspends the deemed VAT from passing of the act.?
While suspending the deemed VAT is a welcome move, it would eliminate many practical inconvenience if the effective date of the suspension is reconciled with the effective date stated in the web notice, i.e. January 1, 2016.
Deemed input credit
A concept of ?deemed input credit? has also been introduced to provide relief to wholesalers and retailers who transact with persons who issue a non-tax invoice (person unregistered for VAT). This concept enables the VAT registered wholesaler and retailer to claim input VAT on their supplies to non-VAT registered persons, thereby the burden on the VAT registered wholesaler and retailer.?
The concept of deemed input credit is novel to the Sri Lankan VAT system and is not in line with the ?invoice credit method? that is followed by Sri Lanka. This provision has been introduced to provide relief to small-scale wholesalers and traders who are reluctant to enter the VAT net, due to the fear of not being able to claim input VAT from the non-registered suppliers.?
However, the bill states that this would apply to wholesalers and retailers for any period commencing on or after May 2, 2016. Thereby even large-scale wholesalers and retailers can make avail of this relief, which may not be the intention of introducing such a provision.
An administrative provision has also been introduced for compulsory submission of schedules along with the VAT return. Non-submission of schedules is deemed not to have furnished the VAT return. A six-week period post the end of the taxable period is introduced to submit the complete schedules.
The bill includes restrictions/limitations for VAT exemptions in areas such as dairy, healthcare services, telecommunication services, supply of rental accommodation, etc. The NBT Bill was issued on August 19, 2016 and includes amendments to the threshold for chargeability. The threshold, which was at Rs.3.75 million per quarter, has been reduced to Rs.3 million with effect from April 1, 2016. The higher threshold of Rs.25 million per quarter, which was applicable for hotel, guest house, educational services, supply of labour, is removed as per the bill.?
The threshold for processing of locally produced agricultural produce will continue to be Rs.25 million per quarter. NBT exemption on lubricant, telecommunication services and on supply of electricity has been removed.
The Port and Airport Development Levy Bill (PAL) issued on September 22, 2016 states that the rate of PAL will be 7.5 percent with effect from January 1, 2016. The gazette notification has been issued for the concessionary rate of 2.5 percent extended to certain electronic items.
The Land (Restrictions on Alienation) Act Bill issued on September 2, 2016 states that the land lease tax will not be imposed with effect from January 1, 2016.
The presentation was followed by a panel discussion with eminent personalities from the business sector. The panel comprised of Hemas Group Chief Financial Officer Sanjeewa Samaranayake, Epolanka Holdings Group Financial Officer Thamesh Fernando and KPMG Sri Lanka Principal Tax and Regulatory Suresh I. Perera. The session was moderated by KPMG Senior Manager Tax and Regulatory Rifka Ziyard.?

Controversy surrounds a letter sent by SAITM students to GMOA
	
Controversy surrounds a letter purportedly sent by the Student Action Committee of the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) to the Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) claiming that the SAITM had allegedly forced its students to sit for the professorial appointments without pre-professorial clinical rotations and forensic medicine.
GMOA Assistant Secretary of the GMOA Dr. Haritha Aluthge said at a media briefing held yesterday in Colombo that they received a letter from the SAITM Student Action Committee two weeks ago.
?According to their student guidelines, all pre-clinical subjects and all clinical rotations must be completed in order to be eligible to sit for the professorial appointments. But it is found that the 5th batch of the SAITM is going to start the professorial appointments, without completing their pre-professorial clinical rotations and forensic medicine. At the same time it is found that some students in the 3rd batch are continuing their professorial appointments without completing pre-clinical subjects,? Dr. Aluthge said by reading the letter to the media.
However, when the Daily Mirror contacted the President of the student committee Prageeth Wimalachandra, he rejected sending such a letter to the GMOA though his name had been mentioned in the letter as the sender.
He told the Daily Mirror that the letter was a fake one. He also said they would look into the matter and take further action against the futile attempt.
The letter given by the GMOA has been dated October 10, 2016 which is yet to fall. Even the GMOA's Dr. Aluthge was unaware whether the letter was dated on 10.10.2016. (Piyumi Fonseka)
