Bangladesh considers to abandon Islam as state religion
	
In the wake of extremist attacks in the country, Bangladesh is considering to abandon Islam as its official religion, according to a report in the Daily Mail.
The Supreme Court will hear arguments that challenge Islam's status as an official religion. The debate comes after the deadly attacks by Islamist extremists on people belonging to other religions.
Religious leaders of minority communities are leading the battle in court against Islam. Moreover, US had warned that Islamic State group continues to recruit its fighters from Bangladesh.
Majority of Bangladeshis are Muslims and constitute nearly 90% of the country's population, while Hindus account for 8% and rest includes Buddhists and Christians, Deccan Chronicle said.
Bangladesh was declared as a separate country after its split with Pakistan in the year 1971. In 1988, the country declared Islam as a state religion.

Doctor operates on wrong knee
	
A child who had been admitted to Peradeniya Teaching Hospital for treatment of a swelling on her right knee, had had her left knee operated on instead, it was reported yesterday.
Sources revealed that the child, a resident of D.B.Wijetunga Mawatha, Pilimatalawa, had been admitted to hospital on February 20 on account of a swollen knee. A doctor had examined her and decided to operate on her on March 1. The specialist who examined her had afterwards gone abroad on a training course and another doctor had performed the operation.
When the child was discharged from hospital her father had found that the left knee had been operated on and not the right -- which was still swollen.
When this was pointed out to the surgeon by the child?s father, he had said that the child had had a swelling on her left knee as well, and the operation on the right knee would be performed later. He had insisted that the child remain in hospital for another three days for this operation.
The child?s father had lodged a complaint with the Peradeniya Police and also brought this matter to the notice of the director of the hospital. The director had conducted an inquiry and said that the specialist who was abroad would return to the island on the 8th, and a formal inquiry would then be held.
However the child?s parents had taken her away from the hospital and admitted her to another.
The director of the Peradeniya Hospital is to conduct an investigation into the matter. Police are also conducting investigations under the direction of ASP Ananda Ratnasuriya. (Nadeeka Daya Bandara and Senerath Bandara)

Elephant calf stayed by its dying mother till the end
	
From Palugaswewa, Elapathwewa in Horowpothana comes a report of an elephant calf who had stayed with its mother for a number of days until Wildlife officers arrived to attend to her after it was injured as a result of coming into contact with an Improvised Explosive Devise (IED), more commonly known locally as a Hakkapatas trap.
Veterinary Surgeon Chandana Jayasinghe had led a team that had arrived at the scene after being alerted about the condition in which the mother elephant was in by area residents. However, even after they arrived the seven-year-old elephant calf had refused to budge from the side of its mother which was around twenty-five years old. This had made it extremely difficult for the Veterinary Surgeon to treat the elephant which had ultimately cost the animal its life although they were finally able to start treating it after getting the calf to move away from its mother.
Dr. Chandana explained that due to the extensive damage done to its internal organs as a result of the IED or Hakkapatas, they were unable to save the she elephant.
Finally the wildlife officers were able to chase the elephant calf into the forest. (Pathum Dharshana-Horowpothana)

Govt. intends repealing PTA: Mangala
	
The Foreign Affairs Minister in his address at the meeting of the Governing Council of Community of Democracies in Geneva said the government was in the process of repealing the Prevention of Terrorism Act and introducing a new counter-terrorism legislation that is in line with contemporary international practices.
At the meeting held on March 2, Minister Mangala Samaraweera said the government, under President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe?s leadership, had been working closely with the international community, resurrecting strained relations with the United Nations and other traditional partners.
He said: ?It is our firm belief that in this journey that we have undertaken, Sri Lanka requires the support and assistance of all her friends in the international community. This is in keeping with Sri Lanka?s traditional, age-old persona, which for centuries has been an inclusive society that reached out to the world, guided by her geographic location at the centre of the Indian Ocean between East and West, and welcomed ideas from the outside world that enriched our society.
"The Community of Democracies must find ways and means of standing together to assist each other in times of peril, especially when faced by terrorism which threatens the fundamentals on which democracy is based.
He said moreover, when countries like Sri Lanka stand up to uphold democracy and pursue reconciliation and development despite sustained efforts by terrorists, extremists and potential despots to destroy democracy, the democracies of the world must come to their assistance through every means possible ? including sharing experiences, increasing trade and investment, assistance for capacity building and institution building.
Minister Samaraweera further said a viable democracy is where citizen feel content and satisfied. Creating and maintaining a viable democracy is not easy. I believe this to be true for the developed as well as the developing countries, although the nature of the challenges that each of us face may be different.
"Flaws in our systems and weaknesses can lead to disillusion with politics among people. This is natural. But maintaining the sustained interest of the public is important for a democracy to thrive as the people are an integral part of a democracy. Without fundamental human rights, strong institutions, right education, economic development, ensuring constant safeguards against corruption and robust checks and balances, democracy will always be in peril. And we must help each other in our mutual effort to safeguard and strengthen our respective democracies", he said.

She laments a false rumour was circulated by persons with vested interests that the child is HIV positive and his father died of HIV/AIDS.
The Principals of both schools indicated unwillingness to admit the child purportedly due to the aforesaid false rumour and the protests by some parents.
She state notwithstanding the fact that there was no obligation to do so, in view of the compulsions arising from the exigencies of the attendant situation, her child was subjected to an HIV test which confirmed that her child was not HIV positive.
She bemoans that she desperately visited a number of schools in the area, beseeching the respective principals to admit her child but those principals did not admit her child as the Principal of Bohandiya Primary School had informed them not to admit.

She is seeking the Court to direct the IGP to take all necessary steps to ensure that her child?s right to a formal education and school attendance is not disrupted or obstructed or impeded by any person or persons and to conduct an investigation as to whether any one of the respondents are acting under duress or coercion or undue influence of any form or manner.
She is seeking a declaration from the Court that her child is entitled to be forthwith admitted to Grade One in a government school within two miles of her residence. (S.S. Selvanayagam)

Minister involved in hit and run accident: Wimal
	
Opposition MP Wimal Weerawansa yesterday criticised the Government for not taking any action against a Minister, who was involved in a road accident, where two youths had been injured at Rajagiriya last Monday.
He questioned as to why the Government was not taking action, when the CCTV footages, had clearly showed the way the accident happened and the Minister had driven, his vehicle without any security officer.
He claimed that one of the two injured youths was in critical condition.
?All the family members of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa and his acquaintances are being arrested over various reasons and some of the charges and laws have never been heard of,? he said.

He said that double standards of law were being implemented for those who were in the Government and the Joint Opposition.
Speaking on the investigations into the murder of former Havelock's Sports Club Captain Wasim Thajudeen, MP Weerawansa alleged that the Government was changing its narrative on the Rugby player?s death.
He said that the Government first claimed Yoshitha Rajapaksa was involved due to a dispute over Yoshitha?s alleged girlfriend, appeared to be failed, after it was found that Yoshitha Rajapaksa was abroad at that time.
Mr. Weerawansa said that the Government was now going after MP Namal Rajapaksa.
?Now, the Government is claiming that Namal Rajapaksa committed this crime to take over a Sport Club,? he said. (Piyumi Fonseka)

Rajagiriya accident: Champika clarifies
	
Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka today said he would not influence police investigations into the incident in which a jeep along with a driver attached to his Ministry met with an accident on Sunday night.
Addressing a function, he was responding to media reports about this accident which occurred on Sunday night.
The Minister said: ?A jeep attached to the Ministry?s vehicle pool is involved in the accident. Also, the driver of the vehicle is an employee of the Ministry. There are distorted media reports in this regard. We all know there was a motor vehicle exhibition at the BMICH in Colombo. After the event, a group of youths had travelled along the Parliament road in their motorbikes. The motorbike that collided with the Ministry?s jeep has an engine capacity of 1000 CC. A bike with such an engine capacity is not permitted to be motored on roads in Sri Lanka. Yet, on that day, more than ten persons have sped on roads within a haphazard manner. One of them has collided with our vehicle?.
He said the police had been entrusted with investigations into the incident, and he would not influence the process at all.
?We believe the police will do an impartial job. During the past few years, we witnessed youths riding high speed motorbikes on roads in a haphazard manner. There was a pause for it. Again, we are witnessing the same. We have not concealed any information. All the details have been given to the police. We, as law ?abiding citizens, cooperate with the police and the court process,? he said.
He said legal action could be ascertained through the court process.

What?s wrong with issuing a letter seeking favour? Kiriella
	
Says has cordial relations with media, will remain so in the future
Minister of Highways and Higher Education Lakshman Kiriella questioned what was wrong with issuing a letter seeking a favour for a supporter of the UNP that had been in the Opposition for more than 20 years.
He told the media today in Kandy that he would not deny that he issued a letter seeking employment to one of his supporters based on his qualifications and that it was not a violation of the policy of good governance.
The minister said some media personnel attempted to draw a wrong perspective of the statements made by politicians, but he would never get involved with controversies with the media.
?It is a baseless allegation that we insulted and harassed the media person. We have never abducted media personnel or made them disappear. I have had cordial relations with the media and it will remain so in the future. It is sad that individuals who abducted and destroyed media personnel are shedding crocodile tears for the media and agitate for media freedom. I would like to tell Wimal Weerawansa that we have never abducted media personnel by white vans. However, he must keep in mind that we have the right to express our views just as the media has the right to write. I reiterate that the issuing of the letter to a supporter to find employment was in no manner against the policy of good governance.? the minister said. (J.A.L. Jayasinghe)
