GMOA to take legal action if SAITM graduates granted provisional registration
	
Government Medical Officers? Association (GMOA) told Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne today that it would take legal action if the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) students said to have passed the MBBS degree are granted provisional registration.
GMOA General Secretary Dr. Nalinda Herath had in a letter to the minister asked him not to interfere in the work of the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC).
While condemning the efforts made by those who backed SAITM, Dr. Herath said they still believed the Health Minister would not safeguard such enterprises.
?We have reliable information that SAITM has already requested Sri Lanka Medical Council in a letter dated June 10, 2016, to grant provisional registration to some of its students. We need you to refrain from granting approval because it is a violation of the Medical Ordinance,? Dr. Herath said.
He emphasized that provisional registration could only be granted to the students who have passed out from a recognized university or institution under Section 19C of the Medical Ordinance.
Meanwhile, the GMOA said it had written to SLMC President Prof. Carlo Fonseka reiterating that since the SAITM?s medical degree did not meet the prescribed standards, students who pass out from the SAITM could not practice as doctors in Sri Lanka. (Piyumi Fonseka)

Sugath Kumara Lakmana, the individual who was arrested on charges of threatening President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe through social media, has lodged a complaint with the Human Rights Commission yesterday saying he was illegally arrested and detained in Malaysia.
Speaking to the media outside the Commission, Lakmana said that the CID arrested him on April 22 in Malaysia and detained him for five days prior to extraditing him to Sri Lanka.
The CID arrested Lakmana, a resident of Yakkala for allegedly making death threats on the lives of the President and the Prime Minister when he arrived at the Bandaranaike International Airport on April 27.
Colombo Chief Magistrate Gihan Pilapitiya severely warned the accused not to repeat such an offence and he was ordered to be released from the case.
?I was detained in Malaysia for about five days. I think it was illegal. I lost my job and don?t have an income to feed my child. I complained to the commission seeking justice,? he said. (Darshana Sanjeewa and Indika Sri Aravinda)

Other taxes likely to be removed except for VAT: Eran
	
State Enterprise Development Deputy Minister Eran Wickramaratne said today the Government was gradually removing the various taxes imposed on goods and services so that in future the taxation would be restricted to the Value Added Tax (VAT).
He said most of the countries were imposing VAT, which has been termed as a progressive form of taxation.
The deputy minister said the previous Government had imposed various taxes under different names but those taxes were being removed and only the VAT would remain.
The deputy minister said the Government was considering changing the implementation of VAT and that certain healthcare services including outpatient?s services in private hospitals would be exempted from the VAT.
?Medical tests such as dialysis would be exempted from the VAT and services in the outpatients departments in private hospitals would also be exempted from VAT. But if someone was taking in-house treatment at a private hospital, they would be subjected to the VAT,? he said adding that the Government was studying imposition of the capital gains tax as a form of reducing the income gap which had increased enormously during the past decade.
When asked about reappointment of Central Bank Governor, the deputy minister said it was up to the President to decide after considering several factors including his performance.(Ajith Siriwardana)

Police fire warning shot; Lankans off Aceh to be escorted back
	
Indonesian Police has fired a warning shot into the air after a group of Sri Lankan women who have been stranded off the coast of Aceh since June 11 disembarked from their boat in defiance of orders from Indonesian authorities, the Sydney Morning Herald reported today.
An eyewitness has told Fairfax Media the five women, who are among 44 Sri Lankans who claimed they were en route to Australia when they suffered engine trouble, had earlier pleaded that a child they said was sick be allowed to come to shore.
Indonesian authorities have refused to allow the Sri Lankans, who are believed to be Tamils, to disembark in Indonesia because they do not have passports or travel documents.
This is despite Amnesty International and the Geutanyoe Foundation for Aceh urging the Indonesian government to allow the Sri Lankans to disembark and meet with UN refugee agency officials.
Ahmad Samadan, the head of immigration in Aceh, told Fairfax Media the boat of Sri Lankans would be towed off the beach and then escorted out of Indonesian waters when the weather calmed down.
"Once they leave Indonesian waters it's up to them where they go next," he said.
However, Indonesian media reported that the group of Sri Lankans stranded off Indonesia is set to be ?escorted? back towards India.
Describing the Sri Lankans as ?illegal immigrants?, the head of the Aceh immigration division A Samadan said they had been rejected on four grounds, including a lack of travel documents and a failure to notify authorities of their intended arrival.
The boat will be escorted out of Indonesian waters towards India, Mr Samadan told AAP on Thursday.
The international director of the Geutanyoe Foundation, Lilianne Fan, told Fairfax Media the Sri Lankans had indicated to local journalists that they had left Jaffna, the capital city of the northern province of Sri Lanka.
Fairfax Media understands the women who jumped off the boat sat on the beach and mimed shooting themselves in the temple.
In chaotic scenes local police tried to cordon off the beach and persuade the remaining Sri Lankans to stay on the boat.
Fairfax Media understands the five women, who suffered mild injuries jumping on shore, have now returned to the boat where they - and the sick child - are being treated by Indonesian health officers.

President should consult us: Digambaram
	
National Workers Congress Leader and Estate Infrastructure Development Minister P Digambaram yesterday said President Maithripala Sirisena should consult government politicians representing the estate sector before giving any ministerial posts to Arumugam Thondaman who is tipped to crossover to the government.
? There is a moral obligation for the President to consult us before making a decision to take Mr Thondaman to the government fold as it was we who worked for him at the presidential elections. Mr Thondaman is a person who told the estate people not to vote for Mr. Sirisena,? Mr Digambaram said.
Mr Digambaram told the Daily Mirror that they are not opposing Mr Thondaman?s crossover to the government but only highlighting the point that he and the others such as Minister Mano Ganesan should be consulted before making a decision on Mr. Thondaman.
Mr Thondaman is expected to crossover to the government soon. (Yohan Perera)

Thilina Gamage case: Gangodawila Court Registrar noticed
	
The Colombo High Court today directed the Gangodawila Magistrate's Court Registrar to immediately forward the case file -- on the inquiry in which former magistrate Thilina Gamage is charged with the rearing of an elephant in contravention of the Public Property and Fauna and Flora Act -- to the Colombo High Court.
This order was given by HC Judge Manilal Waidyathilaka when a motion filed by Counsel J.M. Paumi on behalf of Mr. Gamage was taken was taken up for hearing after considering a request made by the Senior State Counsel Dileepa Peiris.
The motion was filed in connection with the revision application filed by the Attorney General in response to the order given by the Gangodawila Magistrate Kanishka Wijeratne on June 2 releasing Mr. Gamage on bail.
Objecting to the motion, Counsel Peiris told court that the motion had been filed to clarify the ambiguity in the HC order of June 13 suspending the Gangodawila Magistrate's bail order.
He said it was illegal to file a motion to clarify the ambiguity of any order given by Court.
Earlier, the Colombo High Court suspending the Magistrate's bail order, noticed former magistrate Thilina Gamage to appear in court on June 21.
However, the counsel who filed the motion recalled it without any submissions and ascertained that his client Thilina Gamage would appear in court on June 21 in keeping with the High Court order. (Shehan Chamika Silva)

Will MS, RW follow Filipino Prez? Namal
	
UPFA MP Namal Rajapaksa yesterday questioned if President Maithripala Sirisena or Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe would consider replacing the luxury vehicles for Cabinet ministers with cheaper vehicles following the footsteps of newly elected Philippines President, Rodrigo Duterte.
?Wonder if the Prime Minister or the President will consider a similar option for Sri Lanka?? the MP tweeted.
As part of austere style of governance, incoming Philippines President Duterte had planned to replace luxury sedans with cheaper cars for cabinet members.
Media reports said Duterte had identified the Toyota Avanza MPV as the official vehicle that will transport most senior members of his administration.
Duterte, who is expected to be sworn in as president on June 30, has also vowed to make these new ?ground rules? effective on the day he takes office.
Less than a week after his election victory, he announced plans to sell off the presidential yacht and wanted all aircraft assigned to the Presidential Airlift Wing to be converted to ?air ambulances?.
