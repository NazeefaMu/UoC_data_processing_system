A city that befriends the ageing and disabled
	
Differently abled people have always been a marginalised section of the society, in most instances being sympathised with rather than given a hand. This is similar in the case of the ageing populationas well.
Programmes were carried out at schools
But these two groups of people also have their own rights and freedom of life, hence, neither their disabilities nor age should be considered as obstacles to keep them from moving forward.
Sri Lanka too has a considerable percentage of people that fall in to both these categories. In order to break the stereotypical perspective revolving around these two sections, the Disabled and Aged Friendly City concept was introduced in the Monaragala District. 

The initiative was taken by Senarath Attanayake - a role model to everybody else who thinks that physical challenges are barriers in life. Senarath has had many firsts, thus displaying his capabilities that make a positive change in society. He became the first wheel-chair bound individual to be called to the Bar as an Attorney-at-Law, the first wheel-chair bound individual to enter the political arena and to be elected to Provincial Council and the first differently abled person to hold a Ministerial portfolio. His efforts to transform Wellawaya and the entire Monaragala District in to a Disabled and Age Friendly City have been tremendously successful and the project has come a long way from when it started. 

Monaragala, despite being the second largest district in the country is also one of the poorest, says Attanayake during a recent interview with the Daily Mirror. Through this project Im trying to address the childrens rights for education. Therefore Im in the process of identifying schools having physically challenged children to improve accessibility facilities. Hence, the classroom, library and toilets are the main places which we are trying to implement facilities like ramps etc. In addition to that we will be giving wheelchairs and other devices. There are some parents who cant afford to fund the education and other medical needs of their children. So we are going to give them a hand though self-employment projects as well. Another important aspect of this project is that we are going to highlight the voting rights of the ageing population as well as that of the differently abled. What we see is that during an election the politicians provide transport for the differently abled to go to the polling station and cast their votes. Otherwise they dont have a way to cast their votes with dignity and nobody talks about it either. So we will be including ramps in every polling station in the district with tactile paving for the visually impaired. We are also in the process of implementing a tactile ballot paper for the visually impaired by 2019 or 2020 elections,Attanayake said.

Speaking further about the initiative, he added that the International Foundation for Electoral Systems (IFES) - an initiative to improve election management in countries around the world- is partnering them in this programme along with the Elections Commission. During the last elections we placed differently abled observers in the monitoring process in the Monaragala District. We have also conducted workshops and awareness programmes for these groups. I believe that if there are more physically challenged individuals in the political set-up it will be easier for us to meet our objectives. Therefore Im also planning on encouraging such individuals to produce their nominations as well. We also have to speak about the religious rights of the ageing population and that of the differently abled.

Healthcare access is another issue that we need to address and highlight. Certain healthcare centres dont have the facilities for differently abled people to visit them. Public places too should be constructed in such a manner, so that differently abled people too could have access to them. One community centre in every district will have access for differently abled individuals thereby promoting an inclusive environment for everybody. According to WHO reports, the differently abled population is at 15%. According to a survey done in 2012, the ageing population is at 12.5%. But they believe that by 2021 the numbers will increase up to 16.5%,he said. Stressing on the fact of inclusiveness, Attanayake further spoke about how rural areas need to be improved first. There is a global programme called the Urban Inclusive Cities Network and I too work with them. We firstly have to improve rural cities and then move to urban areas especially in a country like ours. Sri Lanka is one of the countries with a minimum urbanization rate. Also the poorest of the poor are differently abled and they remain in the rural areas. So we have to introduce accessibility facilities to rural schools, community centres, places of worship and polling centres before coming to the city. Once they are implemented in the rural sector, the urban cities will naturally introduce these concepts. The Monaragala Dstrict has close to 11 divisions where we have established accessibility facilities in over 100 polling centres, eight schools, 18 temples and almost all public places. We also have to focus on their financial independence and we are in the process of identifying their skills. Recently we have started to encourage the aged and the differently abled individuals to be involved in the cultivation of bees honey. So far we have identified 50 families and have provided them with the necessary amenities and an educational programme is underway. We are also trying to join hands with the private sector and implement the bottling process and distribute the products at a better price. Im trying to extend this project to another 1500 families,he said.
Its quite evident that these projects will encourage parents to send their physically-challenged children to school or motivate the ageing population to be involved in a self-employment project. According to Senarath, its only through their provincial council that potential individuals in these two groups have been identified to be employed. Speaking further, Senarath said that they are glad that they have been able to address some important issues that have been highlighted in the UN Convention for the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD). In addition to these projects we are also giving a wheelchair to every committee with elderly people. Through this, anybody who wants to use a wheelchair could use it. And during an election we will also be sending a wheelchair to every polling centre. The President himself has shown interest to implement this project at a national level. Another project is to educate a group of ten individuals on beauty culture. This group comprises of five differently abled individuals who will be working in a salon eventually. We will provide them with salon equipment to start their own business. By doing this we are promoting inclusiveness and other people will interact with the differently abled individuals and they will start to accept them,he explained.
Wheelchairs were givin to committees with elderly people
When asked about the challenges he faced while executing his plan, Senarath said that one of the main challenges that he has faced is dealing with the attitudes of people. Although some people pretend to support me when I discuss these plans, in reality there are only a handful of people to support us. I believe that implementing accessibility facilities in a classroom is far more urgent than doing it elsewhere. Discrimination takes place in every form, but I see that its changing at a slow pace, he said.
So far we have identified 50 families and have provided them with the necessary amenities
In his concluding remarks Senarath said, The message I like to give the general public is that I would like to request them to look at differentl abled people in a rights-based model. Dont look at them in a charitable way. If you have a differently abled person in your family, do accept him or her. Anybody could have a physically impaired condition. But thats not the end of their lives. Send them out in to society, educate them in a school and get them employed. I wonder where I would have been if my parents didnt accept me. So make them a part of this society.

A dark horse to enter the race
	

Picking twhe most suitable person as their presidential candidate has now become a burning question for the JO activists, they say.

Meanwhile, a general consensus has emerged from the rank and file that the veteran politician now leading the JO in the council should be the logical choice. This leader seems to be happy that his name is being mentioned as the groups possible nominee for President. Meanwhile, some Buddhist monks on hearing that this veteran leader is to be JOs Presidential candidate have reportedly invoked their blessings on him.
However, some JO stalwarts supposed to be in the inner circle of the group say that the veteran leader has been brought into the scene only as a diversionary tactic and the groups de facto Presidential candidate is someone who prefers to remain behind the scene for the present.
The reason as to why the groups presidential-candidate to-be is being kept away from the limelight is privy to only the former strongman and his very close confidants, they say.

## Title: Anugamana an offering in Odissi dance

Anugamana an offering in Odissi dance
	
Odissi, referred to as Orissi in older literature, is an ancient Indian classical dance that originated in Hindu temples of Odisha  an eastern coastal state of India 

31 July 2017, Colombo, Sri Lanka  Anugamana, (the ongoing journey) presented by the Indian Cultural Centre at the Russian Cultural Centre recently, was an offering of Odissi dance showcasing the talent of Sri Lankan born Nritta Ganeshi Manoharan, and daughter of a leading proponent and teacher of the Bharatanatyam dance form, Shangitha Namasivayam and two senior exponents of the Odissi dance form,Leena Mohanty and Daisy GaraniVijayakumaran. 

This debut performance in Sri Lanka, comprised five items choreographed by Leena Mohanty, with music composed by Sri Dheeraj Kumar Mohapatra, and was especially momentous for Nritta as it was her first in her motherland.The event was graced by the presence of R Sambandan, Leader of the Opposition and the Acting Head of the Indian High Commission, Arindam Bagchi. In addition to members of the public, well-wishers, friends, doyens of Sri Lankan dance Khema and Upekha, Haridevi Jauasundara, Vasuki Jagathesswaran and Nirmala Benedict were in the audience.

The Performance
The evening opened with Mangalacharan, a salutation to Goddess Saraswati, who can take any form, and bestower of all boons. Mangalacharan was performed by Nritta and Daisy. Nritta has that rare quality in dance that transcends the exposition of technique, capturing her audience. Her fluidity of movement and grace were in deep contrast to Daisys technically perfect and precise expression. The second item, Pallavi, was performed by Leena and Nritta. This elaboration of a melodic-rhythmic theme built gradually into complex patterns and variations, capturing the mood of the monsoon with Leena Mohantys choreography. Leena and Nritta were in delightful harmony as they performed the duet. Leenas choreography brought to life the Gita Govinda, a work composed by the 12th-century Indian poet, Jayadeva, which describes the relationship between Krishna and the gopis (female cow herders) of Vrindavana, and in particular one gopi named Radha. The item performed by all three dancers to the music of Guru Rama Hari Dasand was a compelling demonstration of the strengths of each performer
. 
A star is born, said Swami Shantanand Saraswati when he saw Nritta perform at the age of 5 and expectations were high when she stepped onstage alone. Nrittas solo performance of Chamunda Stutee was a revelation of the breadth and depth of the talent of this young dancer. Gone was the graceful, genial beauty and in its place, was a compelling and credible  Chamunda. Chamunda, one of the chief yoginis and the slayer of the demons Chanda and Munda. In Nrittas dance one could envisage the garland of severed heads or skulls, a drum, trident, sword held in her hands, snake, skull-mace, thunderbolt, drinking vessel or skull-cup filled with blood. The dancers strong, sharp movements made believable that she stood on the corpse of a thwarted demon or man. Her facial expressions complemented her movements and this was the most enthralling performance of the evening. It dazzled.

The evening ended with Jaaga Maheshwara danced by Leena and Daisy, evoking Lord Shiva as Nataraja worshiped as the king among dancers He is described as the greatest yogi who wears the sky as his garments, balancing on a solitary foot, totally poised. A well-executed finale to a grand evening of Odissi dance. 

Anugamana was indeed a fitting title  as this is but one performance in these dancers ongoing journey in their search of the sublime and perfection of execution of Odissi dance. The evenings Odissi was in the style of Guru Deba Prasad Das, which is known for its pristine qualities and immaculate compositions, and his fascination for exploring and deriving inspiration from tribal dance movements. 


The Artistes
Nrittas name translates to pure dance, and she has chosen to express her natural gift for dance through Odissi since her early childhood, blazing her own trail around the world as one of the youngest and most promising stars of the dance form. She has delivered outstanding performances which have prompted invitations from India and Orissa, home of Odissi. Nritta was selected by Singapore as one of six Wonder kids of Asia for her academic performance and her excellence in Odissi. She has also been named as one of the top ten young Odissi talents in India. Nritta is currently pursuing a degree in Engineering at the University of Newcastle, Australia whilst continuing to seek perfection in dance under the tutelage of great teachers such as Guru Durga Charan Ranbir and Leena Mohanty. She is currently also in her final year of a Masters programme in Odissi with the Pracheen Kalakendra in india. 

Leena Mohanty is one of the leading exponents of Odissi dance and is a senior dancer with wide national and international experience.She was the recipient of the first Ustad Bismillah Khan Youth Award in 2006 from Sangeet Natak Akademi, New Delhi and has been awarded the coveted and prestigious Mahari award. She is the artistic director of Bansi Bilas, an institution devoted to training young and upcoming dancers of Guru Deba Prasad Das School of Odissi, and of the Trinayan Dance Theater, New York City, USA. She also heads the Odissi Department of the Kalpana Dance Theatre, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. 

Daisy GaraniVijayakumaran has been involved in Bharatanatyam and Odissi dances for the past 30 years. A senior dancer with wide performing experience, she has trained for many years with the artistic director of the Kalpana Dance Theater, Shangita Namasivayam, Daisy combines perfect technique. Ever the student, she is intensely desirous of exploration within the inspiring realm of classical dance. She has been awarded the title Singaramani by Sursingar, Mumbai, India. 

Odissi Dance
Odissi, also referred to as Orissi in older literature, is a major ancient Indian classical dance that originated in the Hindu temples of Odisha  an eastern coastal state of India. Odissi, in its history, was performed predominantly by women, and expressed religious stories and spiritual ideas, particularly of Vaishnavism, but performances have also expressed ideas of other traditions such as those related to Hindu gods Shiva and Surya, as well as Hindu goddesses. 

Odissi is traditionally a dance-drama genre of performance art, where the artistes and musicians play out a mythical story, a spiritual message or devotional poem from the Hindu texts, using symbolic costumes, body movement, abhinaya (expressions) and mudras (gestures and sign language) set out in ancient Sanskrit literature. An Odissi performance repertoire includes invocation, nritta (pure dance), nritya (expressive dance), natya (dance drama), and moksha (dance climax connoting freedom of the soul and spiritual release). 

Odissi dancers are colorfully dressed with makeup and jewellery. The sari worn by Odissi dancers are brightly coloured and usually of local silk (pattasari) made up with pleats, to allow maximum flexibility during the footwork. The jewellery includes silver pieces, and the hair is tied up, and typically drawn into an elaborate bun resembling a Hindu temple spire, and decorated with Seenthi, and a moon shaped crest of white flowers. The dancers forehead is marked with tikka, and the eyes are ringed with kajal, whi;e the ankles are decorated with a leather piece on top of which are bells (ghungroo). The dancers palms and soles may be painted with red coloured dye called alta.

Dikarawa and Aluthgama Houses develop cracks forcing residents to evacuate
	
The residents of Dikarawa and Aluthgama in the Ella Divisional Secretariat live in constant fear of any possible danger to their lives as cracks have started to appear in their houses. The two villages atop the Badulla-Bandarawela road have faced many natural catastrophes over the years, forcing the residents to leave their homes.  
Cracks appeared in one of the houses
Among the many helpless folks in this endangered area is 25-year-old Kanchana Sandamali whose house, situated near a hermitage, has gone to wrack and ruin.
She remains disheartened as the housing loan she obtained to put up a shelter became worthless when cracks started appearing in the structure. Amidst these hardships, the poor girl is attending to the needs of her ailing mother and grandmother, both paralyzed. There is nothing Sandamali would not do for them. As such, we decided to pay a visit to Sandamalis house and unfold a blind tale the world needs to hear.  
Sandamali with her ailing mother and grandmother 
As we entered her house, she gave us a warm welcome. She said she was waiting for her father to return from work. When we inquired about her father, she said, My father is dumb. He is working at the School for the Deaf and Blind for a meager salary which is the sole income for us. If there is something, we eat. If not, we have nothing to do.
Later, we visited other houses in the area. Staring from the bottom of the hill, we took note of the grievances of innocent and helpless people. 
While walking door-to-door, we met J.A. Heenmenika (78) who lives in a cracked house with her husband. 
Minister Amaraweera andChief Minister Chamara inspecting one of the houses
We live in constant fear of any possible danger to our lives. We go to the house of one of our relations at night as it is not safe in here. It is hard to fathom that the shelters we put up doling out all our earnings have been destroyed. No one looks into our grievances. It is the hard-knock life for us, she said as tears poured down her cheeks. Next we met Nishadi whose house too was in a dilapidated condition. She said cuddling her daughter, The walls and floor of our house are cracked. We cannot live like this any longer. It is very difficult. We dont deserve this.
Also, we heard that the service station of Nanda Wijesundara, who joined us on the journey, was faced with a water problem.
The villagers have formed an organisation for community development and to reach out to philanthropists and other relevant authorities. We want some relief. However, Minister Amaraweera and Chief Minister Chamara visited our village in the recent past. They said they provided funds to the Badulla District Secretariat to attend to the needs of the people and to pay compensation to the residents of damaged houses. They said they would attend to the water problem, provide employment to those unemployed and provide a monthly rental for those evacuating their houses, he said.  
He further stated that officials of the Building Research Institute declared the region as a high-risk area. When we spoke to Ella Divisional Secretary Thanushka Abeywardena, she said the geologists who investigated the area had surmised that some 50 houses were facing a huge risk, and that rainfall could worsen the situation.

Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa yesterday said all citizens tasted the freedom as a result of ending the three decade old war except for him as he cannot travel to any foreign country because the international forces are waiting to press charges against him.
During an event held in Colombo last evening MP Rajapaksa said when he was abroad on several occasions, he and his delegation underwent inconvenience in certain countries.
When I visited the Commonwealth Summit in Australia in 2011 someone had demanded my arrest charging he lost his children because of me. Then, when I was in England they tried to file a Court case against the people of my delegation, he said.
He also said that some went to Courts against him when he was in the US. However, the former President said he never complained over these incidents as there was a bigger struggle to develop the nation.
Even though I did not receive benefits of freedom, at least the country and its people did. Therefore we should take advantage of that and should not let the country to drift towards separatism, he said.
The former President said ending the war had resulted in reconciliation. However, today in the name of the reconciliation, some people attempt to split the nation, he said. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

Number One in yahapalanaya said in public the other day that there are several JO Diyawanna members calling on him regularly under the cover of night.

This revelation had highly upset at least three JO members who had immediately presumed that Number One was referring to them.      
Even the JO high-ups admit at least there are three members straddling the fence and maintaining secret ties with yahapalanaya bigwigs.
According to informed sources one of these three nocturnal visitors to the palace is a vociferous former purohita from the Kandy district facing a court case. One of the other two is a shrewd character from Ruhuna. The other one hails from Colombo district and he has one leg in the JO and other on the fence and often serves as a conduit pumping information both ways.

H'tota Port agreement can be amended: PM
	
The agreement signed between the Sri Lankan Government and China Merchant Holdings to develop the Hambantota Port contains a clause which enables further amendments, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe told Parliament today.
He said this in response to a matter raised by Chief Opposition Whip Anura Kumara Dissanayke that Ports Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe had publicly stated that a clause enabling amendments in the future were included in the agreement while President Maithripala Sirisena had also given a similar assurance to Ceylon Petroleum Corporation unions.
Mr. Dissanayake asked whether such clause was included in the agreement or whether the President and the Minister had attempted to hoodwink the unions and the people.
There is a clause enabling the agreement to be amended but we need to determine the amendments that need to be made, the Prime Minister said and added that the CPC trade unions had not raised any issues on the agreement other than being allowed to handle oil bunkering but the Ports Authority had not agreed to it.
It would have been possible to postpone signing the agreement if Parliament was able to hold the debate on July 27 and decide on amendments. However the chaos created by the opposition on that day prevented any kind of debate or the submission of amendments," the Prime Minister said.
The Hambantota Port had up to date incurred operating losses of Rs.9,814 million with an overall revenue of Rs.7,119 million. The overall loses had amounted to Rs.51,530 million. The total debt repayment to date had amounted to Rs.40,813 million. We cannot leave this burden to future generations to settle. It will be possible to provide much needed employment opportunities to the younger generation."
The Prime Minister said Colombo Port unions had asked the government not to use the revenue generated from Colombo Port to maintain the Hambantota Port. (Yohan Perera)

Sri Lankan Ambassador to Qatar A.S.P. Liyanage requested the President and Prime Minister to hold the Ambassadors' Conference scheduled this month despite the no confidence motion brought against Foreign Minister Ravi Karunanayake.
Speaking to the Daily Mirror, Ambassador Liyanage said the countrys diplomatic mission should continue despite political turmoil.
The Ambassadors' Conference was scheduled to be held on August 28 and 29 in Sri Lanka and we have already informed emissaries about the event. Although the venue is yet to be finalised, initial arrangements for the event have been made, he said.
The conference would allow ambassadors to collectively discuss diplomatic trends and plan out their future missions.
There maybe allegations levelled against Minister Karunanayake, but he is someone who has good diplomatic ties with foreign countries. He travelled to Qatar during the crisis to ensure the safety of Sri Lankan expatriates, the ambassador said.
However, when contacted the Foreign Affairs Ministry, the Daily Mirror was told its officials were yet to schedule a date convenient for the President, Prime Minister and other high ranking officials to participate in the event.(Darshana Sanjeewa)

Holistic approach will boost political admin system
	
I read with interest Prof. Rajiva Wijesinghes Suggestions for improving the quality of our legislators presented at an OPA seminar. He has very appropriately placed Change of Electoral system on the top of his list of suggestions. However, he has chosen to confine his discourse to improving the quality of the Legislators or the 225 parliamentarians who constitute the top layer or the Board of Directors of a country having a Decentralised Political administration pyramid.
Parliamentarians still remain demi-gods of the public
Overt attention to parliamentarians
Its regrettable to recall that despite the decentralisation of our political administration system as far back as in 1987 through Provincial Councils (PCs) and Pradeshiya Sabahs (PSs), the parliamentarians still remain demi-gods of the public. The latter together with media are responsible for this state of affairs. As mentioned by the learned Professor, the legislators or Law makers should play a well-defined role assigned to them. Sadly, for the past 30 years, no sincere effort has been made by the top to redefine the roles of the respective layers in the administration pyramid ostensibly due to the compelling greed of parliamentarians to retain their Preference vote base. The question is, why should the taxpayer be burdened with to perpetuate a so called Decentralised political administration system where the MPs at the top have clearly usurped the role of Provincial Councilors and local Govt. politicians to safe guard their Peference Vote base 
Simple remedy
As a remedy to this sad and unfortunate situation and at a time when Electoral reforms are on the clipboard,I wish to reiterate below, the relevant points of my package of recommendations on Electoral reforms presented to the Public Committee on Constitutional reforms -2016, Additional Secretary to the Office of the Constitutional Assembly-2017 and the Chairman of the Election Commission-2017, who by the way, graciously gave me an opportunity to make a presentation to him and his senior officers.

1) Given a decentralized Political Administration system of Governance, it is imperative to rationalize the no. of MPs (225) after a proper work-study by subject experts, based on well-defined Objectives and Role responsibilities. Given the enormous direct expenditure alone borne on maintaining the legislature, by way of salaries, allowances and other perks, the existing number of 225 MPs is an unproductive assemblage for Sri Lanka. 

2) In accordance with the recommendations of the aforesaid Work-study, lay down new role responsibilities and limits for the respective layers in the Pyramid viz.the Parliament, PCs and PSs. The streamlining of the role-responsibilities and powers of MPs in favour of the peripheral PCs and PSs would no doubt justify a huge reduction in high- cost luxury Vehicles and Transport needs of MPs.

3) With the abolition of the Preference Voting (PV) system, the need for national level MPs to collect preference votes will not arise. Therefore, why should they be allocated with Decentralized funds to develop electorates On the contrary, they can recommend supplementary allocations and release of decentralized funds from the national budget to the lower layers of Provincial Councils (PC) and Pradeshiya Sabhas (PS) and monitor usage of funds through the existing District Development Committees. 
4) PSs on the other hand should be depoliticized allowing the people to elect the most acceptable/respectable individuals with high integrity in the locality to act as their independent local agents. Such people surely can be groomed to enter the Parliament. But, as if to add insult to injury, it is learnt that, with the proposed increased percentages for women and youth representation in local Govt. bodies, the number of politicians would be increased by another 2000! Is it fair to expect the tax payers to bear this enormous additional cost burden while getting exposed to increased levels of bribery and corruption infused by local politicians It is noteworthy that all PSs are presently running without the company of local Govt. politicians! 
5) Reforms needed for the General Election Process to improve quality of Legislators With the abolition of the Preference-Voting system, the sole responsibility of selecting and enlisting politically professional nominees in merit order should devolve on the respective Parties/Alliances and not on the voter. How can we stupidly assume that 13.0 Mln voters island wide are the best selectors of the cream of 225 political professionals who occupy the top layer of the pyramid (According to Oxford Dictionary, a professional is a paid person who possesses the required academic qualifications and/or skill and experience to perform his given responsibility or assignment.) Why hide the fact that our voter decisions are mostly based on petty and sometimes illegitimate favours extended by money throwing politicians with their ill-gotten wealth Therefore, a step to compel the respective parties to field their best district-wise teams in merit order will be a boon to Prof. Rajivas effort at improving the quality of our legislators. Presently, this list is furnished in alphabetical order to cover 196 seats. The real objective of the National list (29) too can be achieved by including those nominations also in the district lists so that there will be one master- nomination list of political professionals by each Party/Alliance appearing separately under 22 Districts. As mentioned by the learned Prof. this was the original mechanism laid down under JRs Constitution till it got subverted by the present Preference voting method which added insult to injury. 
6) Since the Election Manifesto becomes a critical document for voter decision, it has to be made a legally enforceable document to prevent Political parties hoodwinking the voters with false and unachievable promises. Further, it will produce a five year action plan document for the quality legislators in the Parliament. 
The question is, why should the taxpayer be burdened with to perpetuate a so called Decentralised political Administration system where the MPs at the top have clearly usurped the role of Provincial Councilors and local Govt.
Conclusion
For some power-hungry, egoistic and corrupt Politicians, for whom the Country ranks below Self and Party, the above measures elicit a Paradigm Shift in their attitudes and approach. I should mention in the same coin that our public too has to be adequately educated by the media on these reforms to the electoral system. It will be seen that all the aforesaid measures if implemented in an un-biased, correct spirit, will reduce unnecessary waste of money, time, material and energy of our human resource leading to increases in productivity and economic growth. Such change of heart through a Positive thinking  culture only, could allow our country to develop in harmony without Confrontational Politics and Stability issues in a rapidly changing world. This model can be applied to Provincial Council elections too with suitable modifications. 
Finally, I reiterate that 90% of the issues ailing the existing electoral system will disappear by simply abolishing the already optional PV system through an amendment to the relevant law. 
It should be stressed in the same vein that under a complex Mixed Voting system (Presently practiced only in some 30 countries out of 213 countries), all the above benefits and productive measures will come to zero, as it will bring back the element of Preference vote (though on a lesser scale) restoring all the ills of the PV system.

How the opponents were outmaneuvered
	

Some yahapalanaya high-ups these days recount with great relish how they managed to sign the controversial Hambantota port lease agreement in a relatively calm atmosphere after outmaneuvering opposition political forces who were raring to create a hullabaloo to mar the big event.

Both JO and Red activists were fully prepared to stage a series of protests on that particular Saturday fixed for signing the agreement.  However, in the meantime, the nerve centre of yahapalanaya issued a media communique announcing that the signing of the agreement was postponed for the following Tuesday. So the opposition forces set for action on Saturday changed their plans accordingly.
However, come Friday evening, the government announced again that the agreement would be signed on Saturday as initially planned. By this time practically all opposition activists had gone out of Colombo with instructions to return on Tuesday and it was too late for the JO and red leaders to regroup their activists for protest action.
So the event proceeded smoothly with hardly any incident to mar it.

India benefit from financial power, IPL: Aravinda
	
Cricket mentor Aravinda de Silva has said the Indian cricket team derives its strength from the Indian Premier League (IPL), the Hindustan Times reported today. 
The IPL has helped them (Indian players) in playing against the best players in the world. They are able to bring in all the international players because of the monetary capability of the Indian cricket board. They all bring in the best knowledge into one country because all the best coaches are there in one competition.
So you have the best knowledge, best competition in one package. That enhances your talent from a very young age, the former Sri Lanka skipper has said in a chat at his residence in Colombo.
He said financial power has helped lift grass roots cricket in India. Even from the grassroots level, they have to be up to a certain level, so they (youngsters) work hard knowing what their (required) level is. Its credit to them for doing it and coming up with such a concept (IPL).
Australia, England, they have kept up with that because their ability to raise funds is also good.
Virat Kohlis No 1 ranked side have won eight successive Test series and are in line for a series whitewash against Sri Lanka.
Aravinda de Silva feels the onus is on the International Cricket Council to help weaker cricket boards maintain standard by supporting their cricket projects on merit.
Recently, the ICC financial model was reworked. As the main market for the game, the BCCI gets the biggest share.
To develop and be a strong cricketing nation, you need to be financially strong as well. The ICC needs to look at it seriously, and make sure some of these (revenue) distributions are done in a manner where some of these countries are also taken up to a certain standard to be competitive, because its unfortunate some people even with talent (dont get the facilities).
The sport has changed into a business and a commercial venture; so, you need to look at it that way.
The ICC is the one who should fill in the gap for the rest of the world, create something out of the box, not to just dole out cash, but fund on a project by project basis.
Comparing the top batsmen of this generation, Aravinda De Silva, who was Man-of-the-Match in Sri Lankas 1996 World Cup final victory, said his favourites were Virat Kohli and AB de Villiers. Virat (Kohli) and AB are the two guys I will pay to watch.
The way they play, they are entertaining, (and) they play proper cricket shots. AB is sometimes a bit unorthodox but bats with lot of confidence and arrogance; he will take on any attack, whether it is pace or spin. Whether it is the longer or shorter version, they are consistent. Of course, (Steve) Smith, (Joe) Root and (Kane) Williamson have done well, (but) they (Virat and AB) have something special.

Is he minting money
	

A story that had gone viral says that there is a Buddhist monk who regularly deposits big money in a private vault in a leading commercial bank.

Even the stalwarts of the political party that the monk actively supports have begun wondering from where this endless stream of money is flowing into his hands.
Some opine that the monk could be the custodian of the liquidity assets of a controversial yahapalanaya politico.
The monk had also been seen very often hanging around the premises of some state-owned business undertakings.
This monk residing in a city suburb that reminds one of banyan trees was the main topic of lobby gossip of Diyawanna members the other day, they say.

Losses show Ravi not the only one: JO
	
The joint opposition said today the losses incurred in the Central Bank (CB) bond sale scam colossal indicating the fact that more government bigwigs other than Minister Ravi Karunanayake were involved and benefited from the scam.
MP Keheliya Rambukwella, quoting State Minister of Finance, Lakshman Yapa Abeywardane, said the losses increased to Rs.1 trillion within the two and half years since it came to light. Minister Abeywardane said at a recent news conference that the losses might increase to Rs.2 trillion during the next 30 years.
This shows that what Ravi received was a small amount from the Rs.1 trillion which is about eight times greater than the revenue from the Hambantota Port, the MP told a news briefing.
He said the government, which came to power promising to end corruption, had no moral right to comment on corruption today and that the bond scam was not something that happened on the spur of the moment but a well planned operation.
The Central Bank was brought under the purview of the Prime Minister and then Arjuna Mahendran, a Singaporean citizen, was appointed as governor despite objections and these decisions had led to the scam, the MP said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa whilst lauding the appointment of a Presidential Commission of Inquiry (PCoI) to look into the controversial Central Bank (CB) bond issue, charged that the government was now engaged in an attempt to use that as an excuse to cover up all its other faults.
Speaking to the media the former President said today that the PCoI appointed to inquire into the CB bond issue was a result of their struggle to reveal the truth to the public. The joint opposition has on many occasions urged the President to appoint a Presidential Commission to look into this controversial issue. President Sirisena appointed this commission after reacting to our requests for an inquiry to be held so that the culprits could be brought to book, he said.
He said it was necessary to give credit where credit was due and even though he was not satisfied with the governments overall performance the appointment of the commission was a step in the right direction.
He however sounded a warning to the government that it should not try to conceal its other wrongdoings through the appointment of this commission. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)

Some people were openly wondering whether the governing one had got into the Police uniform to convey a special message to the people at a time tensions were rising high in the North due to sporadic acts of violence being committed by a gang of ex-LTTE cadres. 
The news about the governing ones new role soon spread to the other parts of the country and the highly surprised authorities in Colombo had begun inquiring from him what this hullabaloo was about.

Powerful earthquake kills at least 13 in China, 175 injured
	
At least 13 people were killed and 175 more injured late Tuesday after a powerful earthquake struck a popular tourist area in southwest China, according to state media.
Of those hurt, about 28 had been severely injured, state-owned media outlet Xinhua said.
The quake struck Jiuzhaigou County in China's southwestern Sichuan Province late on Tuesday night.
At least five of the people who died were tourists, Xinhua reported, citing the information office of the provincial government. About 2,800 people were evacuated from the severely damaged Intercontinental hotel.
Rescuers are still working to clear the rubble, and there are people buried beneath the debris, state broadcaster CCTV said.
There was some disagreement over the size and power of the earthquake.
The US Geological Survey reported a magnitude-6.5 quake 35 kilometers (22 miles) west-southwest of Yongle, Xinhua reported it was 7.0-magnitude, citing the China Earthquake Networks Center.
Residents in Chengdu, the provincial capital -- 300 kilometers (186 miles) away from the epicenter -- told state media they had felt the quake.
The China Earthquake Administration has launched a Level I emergency response, the highest of its four levels, according to state media.
Almost 400 fire trucks and more than 1,100 firefighters were dispatched to the scene, CCTV said. They are bringing with them 55 life detectors, 30 rescue dogs and 24 generators.
Local authorities announced the closure of the Jiuzhaigou tourist area, which includes a national park known for its waterfalls and topographical formations, beginning Wednesday.
Yu Qian, a local taxation bureau official, told Xinhua that the earthquake cut off power and disrupted phone service in her neighborhood. (CNN)

Prasanna Abeysekera of the 1970s Rock band Cancer  Unsung star off too early
	
Sad to say, Ive never heard of jazz-rock musician Prasanna Abeysekara till I read the appreciation written by Ravi Nagahawatte. Its acutely embarrassing since Ive been a fan of those genres all my life. 
Prasanna Abeysekara
Prasannas sister Sunila Abeysekara had considerable singing talent and she provided background vocals for some of Premasiri Khemadasas most inspired film songs in the 1070s and 80s. She could have had a very successful career as a singer but chose, for reasons best known to herself, to become a feminist and social activist. Its in these spheres that she gained recognition. Her contribution to music would be forgotten today unless one chanced to see her name in the credits of a Dharmasiri Bandaranaike film.
Her brother Prasanna, it would seem, was even less interested in publicity. Jazz and rock music in Sri Lanka are sub-cultures confined mostly to Colombo. Rock music is still regarded by many as drug-induced cacophonic excess while most people would be clueless about jazz. Its doesnt sound as terrible as rock, but whats it all about 
Prasanna a musician with discerning taste (a rare breed) hated drunken party songs. Such people have lean pockets but hearts and minds living to the clockwork rhythm of quality music; something money cant buy.  
Prasanna is quoted as telling Ravi Nagahawatte that music records were scarce back then, when he was a school boy. This was true enough, especially when it came to rock music and jazz. In the Sinhala music stream, 45rpm and 33 rpm EPs and LP vinyl records were numerous enough by the 70s. As for imported Western music, pop predominated. As a lifelong hunter of discarded records in friends houses and pavements, I have come across number of Beatles, ABBA, Boney M, The Carpenters or the Osmonds (Western pop) and Country and Western, too, but little of jazz, rock and blues. 

I have unfortunately never heard of Cancer, the rock n roll band formed by Prasanna back in 1978. I think that was the year when there was a mega music show at the Galle Face Green, featuring both Sinhala and Western pop, with Karunaratne Abeysekara and Vijay Corea alternating as comperes. There were several rock bands but I cant remember any rock n roll. This history, largely undocumented (unless one has the time comb through newspaper archives) is full of unsung ghosts, and only the luckiest got any regular mention. Others just played and died. There is no proper record of the Colombo rock and jazz scene even in Dr. Sunil Ariyaratnes otherwise well-documented work on the history of Sinhalese pop music. Did Prasanna and his bands ever produce a vinyl record Maybe theres a fungus-grown, scratched EP in a dustysuitcase somewhere. 
There is no proper record of the Colombo rock and jazz scene even in Dr. Sunil Ariyaratnes otherwise well-documented work on the history of Sinhalese pop music. Did Prasanna and his bands ever produce a vinyl record

I follow the Colombo jazz scene from the fringes. This may be from a feeling that, socially and culturally, I dont belong to that crowd, centered around Dehiwela and Mt. Lavinia. Love of jazz and rock goes back to school days, and an obscure call of the wild because I had neither family nor friends who listened to that. The only person I knew with such tastes was Pani from Piliyandala, a head turner as he walked home after work with his long hair and bell bottoms. He had a state-of-the art quadraphonic record player at home, and a prize LP collection brought down from England. That was my first real person-to-person contact with rock music  Grand Funk Railroad, the Rolling Stones, Santana  though I cant remember listening to any jazz with him. 
But all these people, though they didnt know each other, are connected somehow. Good music was the invisible magnetic thread which connected them. Its sad when such people go unsung. Prasanna sounds like a musician with discerning taste (a rare breed) who hated the frenzy of the drunken party crowd with their endless call for baila and party songs. Such people have lean pockets but hearts and minds filled with the sheer exuberance of living to the clockwork rhythm of quality music, day and night. Its something which money just cant buy.

Preventing accidents Authorities need to tighten their seat-belts
	
The origins of road traffic accidents can be traced back to the time of the invention of the first patented automobile by Carl Benz in the 17th century, or may go back even further, if the accidents in the regency times caused by horse-drawn carriages are taken into account.
Motorcycles and three wheelers a involved in the worst accidents
At present, about 1.25 million people die each year as a result of road accidents according to WHO statistics. Road traffic injuries are the leading cause of death for people aged between 15 and 29 years worldwide. Talking about the situation in Sri Lankan, after witnessing at least a few accidents- where there are horrifying images relating to them in the media- or by getting involved in accidents ourselves, most of us have become intimately familiarwith the topic. 
But did you know that Road Traffic Accidents claim an average of eight lives per day, going up to three thousand lives per year in our country Did you know that a significant portion of these deaths relates to young men who are a part of the countrys working force Did you also know that their deaths have significantly affected the countrys economy in addition to the loss their loved ones feel 
They have formulated the theory that three wheelers and motorcycles are more prone to crashes because they are the most unstable when it comes to vehicles, and topple easily
These facts were revealed at a press conference held as a prequel to the workshop Road Traffic Crashes: How do we save lives held at the Sri Lanka Medical Association Premises as a preliminary programme to the SLMA annual Sessions.
Dr Achala Jayatilake
More serious than we comprehend
Professor Samath Dharmarathne of the Faculty of Medicine, Peradeniya, speaking on the topic of Road Traffic Accidents (RTA) stated that in Sri Lanka, while three to four people are admitted to the hospital every hour due to injuries from RTAs, a new accident is reported at least once in every ten minutes. 

Figures obtained from the Ministry of Transport and Aviation website reveal that out of the 2824 fatal accidents occurred last year, a majority of 1227 were motorcycle accidents. 405 of the total number of accidents involved three wheelers. We investigated in to the reason behind the increase of fatal accidents regarding these two types of vehicles. Dr Samath and his fellow researchers have discussed this issue in their paper titled Road traffic crashes, injury and fatality trends in Sri Lanka: 19382013. They have formulated the theory that three wheelers and motorcycles are more prone to crashes because they are the most unstable when it comes to vehicles, and topple easily. Since two and three-wheeled vehicles are less robust than other vehicles and dont offer passengers a safe enclosure nor the protection of seat belts, occupants are more likely to be injured in a crash.

According to worldwide data, 90% of the worlds fatalities on the roads occur in low- and middle-income countries, even though these countries have approximately 54% of the worlds vehicles. WHO list the risk factors for increased road traffic accidents, which involves among others, speeding, driving under the influence of alcohol or other psychoactive substances, Non-use of motorcycle helmets, seat-belts, and child restraints, unsafe road infrastructure, inadequate law enforcement of traffic laws, which may all factor in the increased fatalities in low and middle income countries like Sri Lanka. 
Overall effects
Considering the situation in Sri Lanka, the after effects of a road traffic injury were also discussed at the conference. According to Dr Achala Jayathilake, Senior Lecturer of the Post Graduate Institute of Medicine, more than 50% of the citizens who are involved in RTAs are from low income families. Around 1/3rd of the injured are pedestrians, who sometimes have never owned a vehicle in their lives. The majority of the fatal accidents involves males who are in the prime of their youth. 
In the case of a road traffic injury, in addition to the direct financial burden on the family in the form of medical expenses, a less visible, nevertheless considerable, loss also occurs. The debilitation of a working individual causes loss of productivity, especially if he is the breadwinner. The family then suffers a major financial setback. The cost incurred due to the family members taking time off work to care for the injured also cant be ignored. All these expenses add up to a considerable amount of money and resources. This ultimately burdens the society as a whole. This burden has been steadily increasing over the years as is evident from the fact that the incidents of road traffic crashes increased markedly from 61.2 per 100 000 population in 1938 to 183.6 per 100 000 in 2013 as per the above mentioned research, published in the WHO website. In the last year alone, nearly 10 million rupees have been spent by the government as compensation for RTAs, though the expenses borne are much higher than this. 
When observing the ever increasing numbers of RTAs and fatalities over the years, we know that the number of vehicles thatll hit the road are only going to increase each day for the foreseeable future. This puts us in a hopeless situation. But this doesnt have to be so, according to the specialists in the field. The most crucial thing that should be noted when talking about road traffic accidents is that the majority of these deaths, the injuries and the accidents themselves are preventable, commented Dr. Jayathilake. 
Prevention
When talking about preventative measures taken with regards to RTAs and the reduction of the fatalities count, the World Report on Road Traffic Injury Prevention, published by the WHO, suggests a number of improvements. 
Good transport and land-use policies as well as safety-conscious planning and the design of a road network will pave the path towards the reduction of accidents, caused other than through human error. This is relevant to countries like Sri Lanka whose road system needs improvement. 
Compliance with key road safety rules can be significantly increased using a combination of legislation, enforcement of the laws, and information and education. Though we cant prevent the occurrence of Diabetes by bringing forth a law that says a person cant use more than 6 spoonfuls of sugar a day, we can bring laws to establish a speed limit and to ensure road safety. Japan has drastically reduced its RTAs through the implementation of strict laws. For an example, in the case of an accident involving a drunk driver, the owner of the restaurant that sold the driver alcohol is also fined in addition to the driver. The fine is significant, so a person rarely drives while being drunk, commented Dr. Jayathilake, speaking about the traffic laws. He further stated that we should follow the example of developed countries like Japan and Sweden and increase the penalties when traffic laws are violated. Drunk driving should definitely bring heavy penalties. This is because when occupying the driving seat while being intoxicated, a driver is fully aware that he or she is exposing other innocent lives to danger. This is equal to murder, he further remarked. 
When the prevention of an accident fails, our next main concern should be on preventing fatalities and minimizing the injuries. Crash-protective features of a vehicle can save lives and reduce injuries of those who use the road- both inside and outside the vehicle. WHO states that wearing a motorcycle helmet properly can reduce the risk of death by almost 40% and also cut the risk of severe injury by over 70%. Similarly, wearing a seat-belt reduces the risk of a fatality among front-seat passengers by 4050%. The proper use of seat-belts will also reduce the fatality risk of rear-seat passengers by 2575%. Child restraints reduce deaths among infants by approximately 70% and deaths among small children by between 54% and 80%.
WHO states that wearing a motorcycle helmet properly can reduce the risk of death by almost 40% and also cut the risk of severe injury by over 70%.

The availability of good quality emergency care can save lives, and greatly reduce the severity and long-term consequences of road injuries. The countrys emergency care needs to progress, bestowing special attention on improving the emergency medical staff and equipment. In addition, giving basic first aid training to the general public is also crucial because the outcome of the patient greatly depends on the care he receives during the first few minutes immediately following an accident. 
As is evident from the above paragraphs, the prevention of road traffic accidents is a complicated as well as a multifaceted procedure, which cant be undertaken by a single organization. Focusing on mapping an effective plan on RTA prevention was the main focus of the seminar. 
Successful implementation
The two speakers were of the opinion that despite the numerous interventions done by various ministries and organizations, there are no visible improvements in the statistics. The increase in the incidence of road traffic accidents over the years, coming up to three times that of the incidence of 1938 bears further proof to their statement. But as they stated, the main cause for this isnt the lack of taking action.

Even though every ministry has taken measures to make the road a safe place, we see a lack of co-ordination among these ministries and organizations, commented Prof. Samath. He further stated that the RTAs of the country would be significantly reduced if the ministries like the Health Ministry, Education Ministry, The Ministry of Transportation and Ministry of Highways would unify under one action plan, while performing their individual duties. 
Compliance with key road safety rules can be significantly increased using a combination of legislation, enforcement of the laws, and information and education.
Speaking about the measures that can be taken to improve the outcome, Dr. Jayathilake stressed on the need for implementing a special presidential task force to prevent RTIs. The advantage of a presidential task force is that all the ministries, who were working separately until now will sit on one table, where they can develop a contingency plan that is sustainable, enabling them to continue their work in their individual fields, but which will ultimately result in a better, collective outcome, he concluded.

PTL bid 15 times higher by forecasting Govts need: CEO
	
Perpetual Treasuries Ltd., CEO Kasun Palisena who testified before the PCoI, was today repeatedly questioned by Justice Prasanna Jayawardena as to why PTL made a Rs.15 billion bid when the offer was just for bonds worth Rs.1 billion at the auction on February 27, 2015.
Continuing his evidence before the PCoI, he explained the manner in which they bid at the controversial bond auction and the basis on which they decided to place a bid 15 times higher than the amount offered at the auction.
On February 26, 2015, the Central Bank had advertised for a bond auction for Rs.1 billion.
However, Perpetual Treasuries Ltd. placed a Rs.15 billion bid at the auction -- Rs.2 billion in its name and Rs.13 billion through the Bank of Ceylon (BOC).
The bid of Rs.2 billion placed in the name of PTL and Rs.3 billion of the Rs.13 billion bid through BOC making a total of Rs.5 billion was accepted at the auction.
During the yesterdays proceedings, the commission repeatedly questioned the witness to specify the reasons for making a bid 15 times more at a high interest rate of12.5%.
The witness was of the view that the interest rate should move upwards by February, 2015 because in 2014 the interest rate was suppressed by the government and also because of the uncertainty prevailing in the market with the elections the interest rate was bound to move upward.
Then Justice Jayawardena questioned the witness whether it was his assumption that the interest rate would be moving upward due to various reasons, because such an upward trend had not been taken place and even the market reflected a much lesser rate despite their expectation.
The witness said that the interest rate expected to move upward since it was quite low in 2014 and that he was unaware about others rates on the bids since he was of the view that his rates (11.5% -13 %) were much reasonable.
Giving reasons as to why PTL had bidded a much higher value irrespective of the offered value of the CBSL at the auction, Mr. Palisena put forward various factors, which made him come to that conclusion by February 2015.
The witness said there were repayments made by the Government on the maturity of the Bonds paid using reserves without raising borrowings, interest rate payments of IMF loans and expenditure hike due to Mini budget proposals by February 2015.
He said analyzing those factors, approximately about Rs. 300 billion was required by the Government by the early part of 2015.
All details were in the public domain, and we keep an eye on government requirements. And also the Public Debt Department was canvassing about the auction by calling us before February 27, 2015, so we predicted that the Government was in need of urgent money, the witness said.
When the witness had stated the fact that there was no limit on bidding at auctions, Justice Prasanna Jayawardena started questioning him more on their bids value which was much higher than what had been offered.
Justice Jayawardena asked Your average bond holding as per what reflects in PTLs management Accounts are around 3.5 billion, so what prompted you to bid such higher amount at this auction although PTLs capital was around Rs. 1.039 and the bid 15 times higher at the auction.
The witness said we knew the Government was desperate for money analyzing various factors, such as debt payments without raising money, mini budget and canvassing of the PDD
Was it prudent to bid a 15 times bigger value having very uncertain prospects, Justice Jayawardena asked. The witness said We wanted to specialize in longer term bonds.
Can you provide one instance that you had bid 4/5 times bigger value than what was offered at an auction earlier Justice Jayawardena asked. The Witness said no.
You have not bid a 4/5 times bigger value at the past auctions but on 27 February, 2015 it was 15 times bigger than what was offered by the CBSL Justice Jayawardena said.
After a series of questioning by the Commission, it came to light that the PTL was having a capital of Rs. 1.039 billion, and about Rs. 3 billion worth of short term bonds and also a maturity payment of Rs. 500 million by March 2, 2015.
Justice Jaywardena asked your cash in hand was amounting about Rs. 1.5 billion and another 3 billion on bonds, so if all your bids had been accepted how were you to settle the payments
Justice Jayawardena was of the view that if the bids were successful then PTL had to settle an amount worth Rs. 14 billion and out of it 9.5 billion has to be raised through some other means because they were not having liquid cash of that amount at that time.
The witness said they had other mechanism to raise such money which he explained as classic Repos with parties and entering into sell and buy agreements with parties such as NDB Wealth Management, BOC, Wealth Trust, First Capital, etc.
Justice Jayawardena seemed unsatisfied with the answers given by the witness and repeatedly questioned on the matter.
Focusing on the limited time frame that PTL had to gain such money if all their bids had been accepted; Justice Jayawardena questioned the witness as to whether they were expecting to conduct transactions amounting to Rs. 10 billion within a short period of time. The witness answer was affirmative.
Questioning again on PTLs bids amounting to Rs. 15 billion at the auction which only offered 1 billion in the advertisement, Justice Jayawardena asked
Justice- there was only one billion offered at the auction ,
Witness - yes
J-But you still bid a bigger value with the confidence that the government was in need of money
W- yes
Justice Jayawardena said Such a massive liability for country like Sri Lanka may have existed in previous years as well, it was not a particularly an unusual auction situation
The witness was of the view that due to the change in the Government and not holding an auction since December 2015 to February 27, 2015 they were predicting that the Government was in need of more money.
Justice Jayawardena said even though the Government was not holding auctions for the time period of December to February, 2015 it had gained borrowings through Direct Placement method and the auctions were not that frequent even in the past.
Questioning the witness reason on governments change in January 2015, Justice Jayawardena questioned was there a policy change of the Government or any announcement with regard to any fiscal policy change by the CBSL.
The witness said no.
Then you had no reason to think February 27 auction as an extraordinary one because it was another auction conducted by the CBSL, Justice said.
Justice Jaywardena also said apart from the New Governor and the new Superintendent of the Public Debt Department of the CBSL there was no change in the CBSL
General practice was to obtain 80% of the fund requirement through Direct Placement Method while Auction being used to test the market rate, and that was the system at the CBSL in fund raising, Justice Jayawardena added.
Justice Jayawardena asked So what made you to bid 15 times more and to think that CBSL would accept greater that what they had offered at the auction
The witness repeated with his stance that they were predicting the Governments fund requirement.
I still cannot see any reason, why you had bid a15 times bigger value when the offer was Rs. 1 billion. It was completely unprecedented as far as PTLs history is concern, do you have a reason to justify it, Justice asked.
Witness said Rs. 300 billion worth of payments made by the Government using reserves without raising borrowings for the maturity repayments of the Bonds, interest rate payments of IMF loans and for the Mini budget proposals by February 2015 and also the canvassing conducted by the CBSL officials on February 27 auction hinted them that the Government in need of money
Mr. Palisenas evidence will continue today. (Shehan Chamika Silva)

Referendum for 20th Amendment - PHU
	
The Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) yesterday said the government should go for a referendum to seek people's consent if it were to bring in the 20th Amendment to the Constitution to hold the election for all provincial councils (PCs) in one day.
PHU General Secretary MP Udaya Gammanpila said the sole purpose of the 20th amendment was to postpone the PC elections till 2019.
"One clause of the proposed amendment says the election for all PCs should be held in one day and that the day should be decided by Parliament. Perhaps, after the amendment, an election for a PC may never be held," he told a news conference.
He said according to current Constitution, the Election Commission has the authority to call for the election once a PC's term was dissolved.
"If Parliament never decided on a date, the election for PCs will never be held. Not even the Supreme Court has the power to direct Parliament to pass a resolution in this regard," he said.
He said the proposed Amendment was against the third clause of the current Constitution and therefore, people's consent at a referendum was needed.
"However, this amendment doesnt mention that it will be subjected to a referendum. Therefore, we will go to the Supreme Court against this once it was presented to Parliament," he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

The final religious ritual of the Kandy Esala Pageant
	
By the time you are reading the newspaper, a strange, but true ritual called the Water Cutting Ceremony would have taken place in Kandy. The ritual dates back to the period of our ancient kings. There is a fallacy that a sword is collected by the devale (A shrine where devotees worship Gods) officials for the Water Cutting Ceremony, connected with the Kandy Esala Perhera. This segment of the pageant is the final ritual in the agenda. But, this story has no foundation whatsoever. Its not only a fallacy, but a myth that has existed for years without any substance.
Diyawadana Nilame of the Maha Vishnu Devale has to make arrangements for the security of the casket
	Gedhige Vihare is believed to have been constructed in memory of Queen Chandrawathie
	Since the time of bringing the Sacred Relic from Delgamuwa to be placed at this Vihare, it has also come to be known as Gaman Maligawa
	The Mahanayake Thera himself then wraps the Golden Casket in a white cloth, seals it and deposits it in the enclosed area
	This function has to be carried out by the Mahanayake of Asgiriya alone. If he falls sick, then this task is performed by the incumbent of the Adahana Maluwa

This ritual happens in an amazing manner. The Golden Casket (Karanduwa) is paraded at the Kandy Esala Pageant. The belief is that a sword is used for the water cutting ceremony that takes place at the Getambe Ferry in the early hours of the final day of the pageant. This belief has no base and how it came to being is unknown. 
But, it is the belief of many that when the Sacred Tooth Relic was brought back to Kandy from Delgamuwa, the auspicious hour had passed. As there was no suitable place to keep the Sacred Tooth Relic, it was placed at Gedhige Vihare for the night. It is said that in order to remember this incident the relic was kept at this Vihare. Now the Golden Casket is kept to remember the incident. There is a plausible reason too. Its recorded that the Sacared Relic was taken to the Temple of the Tooth (Sri Dalda Maligawa) after a auspicious time was available on the following day. What had happened then can be justified. 

On the other hand the responsibility of the Golden Casket now lies with the Diyawadana Nilame of the Maha Vishnu Devale. This official has to make the arrangements for the security of the casket. The Basnayake Nilame has to wait till the following day until its removed. The instructions for the the ritual are given by officials of the Temple of the Tooth. 
On the east side of the D.S.Senanayke Veediya-right in front of the gates leading to Trinity College- is a flight of steps that leads to the Vihare. Earlier the flight of steps was spread, but now the surroundings have changed and one finds only a small flight of steps, towards ones right. This flight also leads to the Asgiriya Maha Vihare, This Viahre is part and parcel of the Asgiriya history. Historians claim that the first resident monks to live in the Kandyan Kingdom were from the Kurunegala District.  
Gedhige Vihare is believed to have been constructed in memory of Queen Chandrawathie, the mother of Vikrama Bahu III. She was known to have been a keen devotee of the Asgiriya Maha Vihare. History reveals that this queen was cremated at the spot where a bo tree stands within the premises. This particular place is believed to be over 600 years old. Gedihige Vihare itself is built of rock according to a Hindu style. This structure is surmounted by a dome also built of rock. The latter is said to contain the ashes of Queen Chandrawathie. 
There is a Buddha statue which was built during the same period when the Vihare was built. While the original building stands, the exterior has some additions. These additions are about two hundred years old and were renovated by the Cultural Triangle in recent times. 
There are markings of a Poya Maluwa, which perhaps indicates that it would have been one of the original Poyages, where monks retreated for their rituals and Upasampada. 
The Adhana Maluwa, which denotes the cremation grounds, was in reality used for the cremation of members of the royal family. The last remains here are that of Prince Maha Astana; the son of Dona Catherina or Kusumasena Devi who died suddenly. Kusumasana Devi suspected King Senerath of having poisoned Maha Astana. With this incident in mind, a disgusted Kusumasna Devi left Kandy and resided in the Kegalle District. After sometime the practice was again revived by the kings of Kandy and ended with King Rajadhi Raja Singhe in 1798. 
Upali Thera from Thailand, who brought Upasamapada rites to Sri Lanka during the period of King Keerthi Sri Rajasinghe, is believed to have been cremated at Adhana Maluwa. There stands a memorial constructed by Thai Buddhists to mark where the ashes had been buried. Earlier a Temple tree marked the place before this construction was built. 
Since the time of bringing the Sacred Relic from Delgamuwa to be placed at this Vihare, it has also come to be known as Gaman Maligawa. The sacred tooth relic was shifted to Delgamuwa Vihare in Kuruwita in the Sabaragamuwa Province and kept inside a grindingstone. This was due to fears that the Portuguese may take possession of this sacred object. It was only brought back after defeating the Portuguese. 
An interesting ceremony takes place at the Gedhige Vihare, only known by a few. On the last night of the pageant, after the golden casket returns to the Temple of the Tooth, the casket is taken to Gedhige Vihare and is kept in the custody of the Mahanayake of Asgiriya.

There is another story as to why the Golden Casket is deposited at the Gedhige Vihare. It is said that this is done to honour Queen Chandrawathie, who had been cremated at this site. Once the casket is deposited at the Gedhige Vihare, the Secretary of the Temple of the Tooth, who is in charge of the inventory of the articles of the Karanduwa or the Golden Casket, comes to the scene. He then outlines to the Mahanayake Thera the valuables that are in the Casket. The Mahanayake Thera himself then wraps the Golden Casket in a white cloth, seals it and deposits it in the enclosed area. 
On the day of the pageant, the Diyawadana Nilame enters the Gedhige Vihare. Then the secretary reads the inventory again to check every item. Once the checking is over the Golden Casket is handed over to the Diyawadana Nilame to be removed and placed on the tusker for its final journey of the pageant. 

This function has to be carried out by the Mahanayake of Asgiriya alone. If he falls sick, then this task is performed by the incumbent of the Adahana Maluwa. Traditionally the Diyawadana Nilame has no power to remove the Golden Casket on his own. It has to be handed over by the Mahanayake for him to be placed on the tusker going in the pageant. 
The Diyawadana Nilame remains inside the Gedhige Vihare until the Mahanayake Thera hands over the Golden Casket, for its removal for the pageant. That then is the ritual at the Adhana Maluwa.

In fact, the other day, one prominent politico declared for the world to hear that he sent his horoscope to an astrologer to have a glimpse into his political future ahead of quitting the government.
A much-talked about politico from the Colombo area and a purohita from Wayamba are among our lawmakers who had recently consulted astrologers. The question most of these politicos ask the astrologers is: What is the most auspicious time for me to cross the floor
Some politicos want to know, they say, why the planets that favoured the ushering in of yahapalanaya have now turned against it.
Meanwhile, several political heavyweights had asked a popular city-based astrologer whether a certain high political authority would survive the brewing crisis. Pat had come the astrologers crisp reply: I will announce my prediction by mid-August!

We'll support no-faith motion against Ravi: SLFP
	
SLFP ministers have informed Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe at todays Cabinet meeting that all SLFP ministers, state ministers, deputy ministers and MPs would vote in favour of the no-confidence motion against Foreign Minister Ravi Karunanayake, a senior minister said.
He told Daily Mirror that they pointed out to President Maithripala Sirisena and the Prime Minister Wickremesinghe that the only way out of the embarrassment to the government and the UNP was to remove the minister before the joint opposition moves the no-confidence motion, most probably, at the next parliamentary session.
The ministers have said they had no alternative other than to support the motion because what was revealed at the Presidential Commission of Inquiry (PCoI) was extremely damaging to the government and the minister.
Prime Minister told us he will discuss the matter with the President and the minister and arrive at a decision as early as possible, the senior minister said.
The Cabinet met last morning after two postponements and was again postponed for last morning on the instructions of the President.
The senior minister said Minister Karunanayake did not turn up for yesterday's Cabinet meeting while the entire administrative machinery especially that of the Foreign Affairs Ministry had come to a standstill as a result of the controversy. (Sandun A Jayasekera)

Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said yesterday a proposal has been submitted to set up a Police and Criminal Justice University for the benefit of police personnel in the country.
The Prime Minister who was the chief guest at the inauguration ceremony to discuss countering terrorism and transnational crimes that affect South and Southeast Asia, said the criminal justice system was paramount to strengthening law and order and enhancing the knowledge of our police personnel.

It was also attended by Law and Order Minister Sagala Ratnayake, Inspector General of Police, Pujith Jayasundara, the Attorney General, the National Police Commission Chairman and senior police officers.
Unlike the tri-forces the police lack the opportunity for research because of the unavailability of a university. Apart from police officers, the Attorney General's Department, the Bar Association and Customs and Immigration officers could also interact with a Criminal Justice University, the Prime Minister said.
He said they were hoping to expand the scope of the university to transnational justice, rights and countering terrorism, which were some of the projects the government was working on.
The Prime Minister said once the Interpol audit was concluded, we should be able to increase the efficiency of the police cooperation in the region.
There are new challenges that the police force had to face globally with globalization and development of technology had changed the nature of maintaining of law and order, he said.
Senior officers from Police forces of seven countries in the South and Southeast Asian region including India, Pakistan, Malaysia, Bangladesh, Nepal, Indonesia and Philippines attended the conference.
The conference aims at expanding and developing the regional cooperation in countering terrorism and transnational crimes sharing experiences to enhance knowledge on law and order.(Darshana Sanjeewa)

Will go to SC against 20-A: MR
	
While urging all SLFP and UPFA MPs to oppose the proposed 20th Amendment on the provincial council (PC) elections, former president Mahinda Rajapaksa said today they would take this matter up in the Supreme Court.
In a statement, Mr. Rajapaksa said all members of the SLFP in the government were elected to Parliament through an election campaign led by him.
I wish to remind them that they were not elected to Parliament to help the UNP to dismantle democracy in this country. The SLFP and UPFA MPs should oppose any law brought to postpone the PC elections and to extend the terms of the existing provincial councils without an election, he said and added that the SLFP/UPFA group in Parliament can deprive the government of the two-thirds majority needed to pass the latest Amendment because it impinges on the peoples sovereignty and their franchise.
We will be petitioning the Supreme Court in this regard. But the SLFP/UPFA parliamentarians acting together can block this in the legislature. They are duty bound to do so to safeguard the rights of the people. If the need is to hold all the PC elections on the same day, the government can bring forward the elections to all Provincial Councils to 2017, instead of postponing the elections till 2019, Mr. Rajapaksa said.
If passed into law, he said the 20th Amendment would allow not only the postponement of all PC elections, but also the extension of the terms of all existing PCs up to September 2019 in a direct violation of the franchise and the sovereignty of the people.
This is the latest in a long list of attacks against democracy perpetrated by this government which came into power through a conspiracy aided by interested foreign parties on January 8, 2015, Mr. Rajapaksa said.
Meanwhile, he said though the 2015 presidential election had been fought on the platform of abolishing the executive presidency, the 19thAmendment to the constitution was a farce perpetrated on the people and the executive presidency still remains unchanged.
Mr. Rajapaksa said executive power was being misused by the government not just to hold on to power, but also to sell strategic national assets to foreigners without consulting the people or even parliament.
He said the Constitutional Council which is appointed by the government and parliamentary opposition together, was also made up entirely of people who had been on the same side at the 2015 Presidential election.
This resulted in the independent commissions and important offices of the state being filled with yamapalana sympathisers. There has never been such a perversion of democracy in this country under any previous government. Even though the yamapalana government won only 106 seats at the 2015 parliamentary election, this has increased to a two thirds majority due to UPFA parliamentarians accepting ministerial portfolios, he said.
