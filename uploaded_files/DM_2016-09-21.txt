A storm shakes the Tree party
	

Infighting within the Tree Party based in the East and led by one from the central hills, has taken a turn for the worse, they say.

The party stalwart Segu from the East is said to have ignited the latest bombshell when he posed 10 questions to the party leader and the partys supreme body relating to some accounts of party funds alleged to have been cooked up at the party headquarters.
High brass from the party are already engaged in talks aimed at replacing the present leader with someone from the East if acceptable answers to the 10 questions are not forthcoming.
Meanwhile, moves are being made by the high-ups of the party led by the wizard of Wilpattu fame to hook several big names of the strife-torn Tree party.

Damage control bid leads to another round of adverse publicity
	

There seem to be many who appear to believe that politics would be quite dry and drab sans the element of love and romance to enliven it.

Perhaps a believer in this concept created a sensation in political circles and the public domain recently when he planted on the Facebook several compromising pictures showing a young couple - a handsome politico from Uva and a comely star from the silver screen in intimate postures.
Of course, the young politico had to face the wrath of his better half when the photos went public. So he asked his girl-friend to lose no time in getting the pictures withdrawn and making a statement that she was a victim of an action of an enemy who wanted to defame her.
The girl readily agreed to this suggestion and the politico got a group of his supporters to record a voice cut from her saying that the pictures were fabrications intended to embarrass and insult her. The recording was done at the spacious car park of a popular restaurant in Rajagiriya area. However, unfortunately, an interested party present at the park at that time had reported the incident to the media generating a new wave of publicity to the Facebook pictures.

Delay in prosecuting culprits draws ire
	

The subject under discussion was expediting legal action against onetime big guns who committed grave offenses during the previous regime.

The participants included a government authority in the highest echelons, a powerful former Madam and several members of the top team in yahapalanaya.
Citing a number of pending cases relating to some grave crimes committed in the past, the participants queried why there was an inordinate delay in bringing the culprits to book. In response, the head of the department responsible for law enforcement, analyzing case by case, explained what they could do and couldnt do,they say.    
However, the former madam and the other political bigwigs, disdaining the explanation proffered by the legal chief argued that all cases they cited were could do ones. When verbal barbs were generating heat, the high political authority intervened saying, We have to respect the legal opinion coming from the proper authorities. And that ended the heated exchanges, they say.

Government planning to sell key Govt. institutions: JVP
	
The Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) alleged yesterday that the government was planning to sell key government institutions such as SriLankan Airlines, Hambantota Port, the Eastern Terminal of the Colombo Harbour, Mattala Airport, and Lanka Hospitals citing they were inefficient and loss- ridden.
JVP leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake said it was an utter lie to claim that they were being sold due to their inefficiency and loss-ridden state and added that it was due to the inefficiency of the economic policy of the government.
The government should take the responsibility of making government institutions inefficient and loss making. All the government institutions such as police and divisional secretaries are inefficient. Are they going to sell them too he asked.
Speaking at a public seminar held at the Public Library in Colombo on Trading, Sacrifice and ETCA, Mr. Dissanayake said the governments only solution to the economic crisis had been to sell and sacrifice government institutions and further expose service sector through ETCA.
He said the government should take control of fair share of key sectors such as finance, energy and electricity as our economy was considerably small and added that the government was doing the complete opposite instead.
The government has already planned to sell Hilton Hotel, Trincomalee Oil Tank Farm and Kalpitiya islets. Plans were afoot to rent out 15,000 acres in Hambantota saying that it is for an industry, he said.
Mr. Dissanayake said they were completely against the exposing of Information Technology (IT) field through ETCA.
We are in a similar state with India when compared to IT sector. We do not need Indian IT experts as we have our own internationally recognised experts. I do not think the first class IT experts would come to Sri Lanka but only third class IT experts would come here and put the job security of our experts in jeopardy with their cheap labour. This would result in our experts migrating to European countries, he said.
He said what Government should do was not to expose our IT sector to India but to expand it which had an unlimited scope for development.
Mr. Dissanayake said the Rajapaksa faction were creating a bugbear of re-emerging of the LTTE and enacting of a Constitution which would divide the country to show their patriotism and cover up their fraud and corruption while the government was also had given prominence to the new Constitution to cover up their inability and failed economic policies.

Telecommunication and Digital Infrastructure Minister Harin Fernando said yesterday he had requested the Finance Minister to remove the taxes imposed on smart phones in the next budget so as to promote data calls among the users.
He said people in other countries use more data calls than voice calls whereas people in Sri Lanka still use voice calls as they do not have access to enough facilities.
The use of voice calls in other countries is only 20 per cent. We still use voice calls to a great extent. I requested the finance minister to remove all taxes imposed on smart phones. We are doing a detailed study on this matter and will submit the recommendations for the 2017 budget, he said.
When asked about the VAT imposed on mobile phones, the minister said the ministry was hoping to mitigate the impact on the users in the next budget and will submit recommendations on this matter as well.
He said the government had planned to allocate a huge amount of money to improve telecommunication facilities and added that such development plans would not be possible without imposing taxes. (Ajith Siriwardana)

He failed to fool the prelate
	

A loud-mouthed one of two-birth dates fame from the JO group the other day had an audience with an eminent Buddhist prelate at his temple in Kandy.

The politico worshipped the prelate and received his blessings as usual. Soon after the exchange of pleasantries, their conversation turned to the current political situation.
Ape hamuduruwane, the new Constitution now in the process of being framed will carry provisions highly harmful to our religion and the integrity of our country, the big-talking politico said dropping what he thought was a bomb shell. 
A visibly unmoved prelate said: How can we entertain such a fear when we are yet to see the proposed new Constitution even in its draft form I think that there is no sense in getting unduly perturbed.
But, Ape Hamuduruwane, the proposed Articles on the status of the nation and religion ready for inclusion in the new Constitution are highly detrimental, the politico rang the alarm bell again.
However, the politicos smooth talk failed to impress the scholar-monk. Why should we worry about something thats non-existent he queried. Not to be outdone, the talkative politico proceeded to cite a host of clues to press home his point.
The prelate who gave him a patient hearing finally dismissed the matter saying: I do not wish to talk about something feared to come up in the future. Let us talk about the so-called pernicious Constitutional provisions when they make their appearance.
A crestfallen JO stalwart who probably had planned to stage an anti-government campaign blitz, following the interview with the revered prelate, had to beat a quiet retreat, they say.

HNB Assurance June profits fall amid higher benefits, claims and expenses
	
Hatton National Bank PLC subsidiary, HNB Assurance PLC saw its net profit for the quarter ended June 30, 2016 falling by as much as 89 percent to Rs. 7.3 million or 15 cents a share from Rs. 64 million a year ago as the net benefits, claims and expenses were higher.
This is also a steeper fall from the Rs.33.5 million recorded in the March quarter.
Both life and non-life gross written premiums (GWPs) grew by 14 percent year-on-year (yoy) to Rs.1.52 billion. 
According to segmental breakdown life insurance GWP rose to Rs.800.2 million from Rs.657 million recorded in the same period last year while the general insurance GWPs rose to Rs.715.8 million from Rs.668.1 million a year ago. 
Motor insurance dominated the general business of the group accounting for over 70 percent of the total GWP. The group Chief Executive Officer, Deepthi Lokuarachchi said the business environment had been, fiercely competitive and a challenging. Lokuarachchi took up the reins in the company just four months ago in May.
According to recent data released by the regulator, Insurance Board of Sri Lanka, there are 28 insurance companies in the country out of which 12 engaged in life business, 13 general insurance and 3 composite insurers  the companies who are in the business of both life and non-life.
In recent times the industry saw some level of consolidation with few deals in the general insurance market happening after the industry split based on life and general yet still the industry is overcrowded.
HNB Assurance also has a fully owned general insurance subsidiary.
Industry players say the general insurance business is tough. With vehicle imports too has now slowed down, the growth prospects in this area too remains cloudy.
Meanwhile the life insurance business which once looked a potential area for growth with the increasing per-capita income is now faced with dim prospects as the inflation and the higher taxes biting in to the disposable incomes of the people making a life insurance policy less affordable.
Sri Lankas life insurance penetration stands woefully low at just above 0.5 percent of GDP (based on GWP).
Meanwhile for the six months ended June 30, 2016 the HNB Assurance Group posted a net profit of Rs. 40.8 million or 82 Cents a share, 49 percent lesser than what the company recorded a year ago.

As of June 30, 2016 Hatton National Bank PLC held 59.99 percent stake in the company being the single

Giving evidence at the inquest held into the death of a motorcyclist at Kirillawala, who was struck by a car driven by the Sri Lankan cricket team's fast bowler Nuwan Kulasekara, Mr. Kulasekara said that he was driving home from Gampaha in his car,when he saw something emerge from the middle island of the road and strike his vehicle.
He said he had attempted to turn to the left and then applied his brakes. He added that there was much traffic on this stretch of road and, therefore, he was driving at the relatively low speed of 50 km per hour.
The inquest was held at the Ragama Hospital yesterday into the death of 28 year old Dinesh Aravinda Nissanka a resident of Maimbula, Nittambuwa -- a bachelor and an air conditioner technician. The Kadawatha Police had informed the inquirer into sudden deaths that on the day of the incident the deceased had been riding a motor cycle and proceeding from Colombo in the direction of Kandy. He had lost control of the motor cycle due to his speeding and, after striking the middle island of the road, had been thrown off and struck a motor car travelling on the Colombo -- Kandy Road and been killed.
Nuwan Kulasekara giving further evidence stated that immediately afterwards he had stopped his vehicle on the left side of the road. He had seen in his side mirror that a large crowd was collecting. He had hastened to the scene and seen the victim lying in a pool of blood and observed injuries on his head. As he feared a mob attack he had kept the car at the spot and waited near a shop awaiting the arrival of the police. He had later gone to the Kadawatha Police Station with the police officers and given a statement.
At the request of the police he had presented himself for the inquiry. He said the victim appeared so suddenly that he could not avoid hitting him.
Mr. Kulasekara also said that as a civic conscious person he felt duty bound to assist the family of the deceased and he would honour his obligations.
The post mortem was conducted by the JMO of the Ragama Hospital, Dr U.L.M. S Perera, who said death was due to the deceased sustaining severe injuries on his head when he struck a moving vehicle.(Devapriya Chandrasiri)

A prominent Buddhist monk hailing from the Narahenpita area recently received a telephone call from the palace of a high government authority.

The prelate, a close friend of the former strongman, was a little surprised to receive this courtesy call from the yahapalanaya high-up given the status of their current political relationship. Nonetheless, he greeted the VVIP caller cordially and thanked him for the call.
Preliminary niceties over, the high authority made an earnest request of the monk to use his good offices to re-unite the Blue party.
In a non-committal reply, the monk had replied saying, I dont mind playing mediator to bring about reconciliation in the party. However, if I am to play that role, I have to form a clear idea about the policies relating to certain key issues followed by the government. If I know for sure where you stand, it will certainly facilitate my role as a facilitator. So let us start negotiations on this basis
The monk had received a few more calls from the palace, but the ball is yet to start rolling, they say.

Sri Lanka central bank bought dollars, but from August 29 allowed excess liquidity to build up, effectively letting the foot of the monetary accelerator to boost credit and stop collecting foreign reserves.
Excess liquidity rose to Rs.20 billion by August 31 as he central bank engaged in unsterilized forex purchases without attempting keep the reserves by sterilizing the rupees. On subsequent days the liquidity disappeared. By September 19, a liquidity shortage rose to Rs.48 billion rupees, up from Rs.31 billion. Liquidity goes short when the Central Bank sells dollars to when excess liquidity turns to imports or foreign loan repayments are made.
Injecting liquidity (printing money) on an overnight basis rather than giving accommodating credit with outright purchases of Treasury bills makes banks search for deposits, which cuts consumption.
Sri Lankas Central Bank generates balance of payments by purchasing Treasury bills outright either to finance the budget deficit or to sterilize forex sales.
On Wednesday the Central Bank injected Rs.43 billion at 8.49 percent overnight, down from Rs.50 billion on Tuesday. On Tuesday the Treasury bill stock of the Central Bank rose to Rs.226 billion, up from Rs.207 billion on Monday.

Salary scales of MPs to be discussed next: Ranil
	
After the announcement of salaries and other allowances for chairmen and members of the independent commissions, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said in Parliament today, the salary scales of MPs had to be talked about next.
However, he said the government would not talk about it at this hour.
"We are not talking about it now. We will move on to it next," he said.
Making his remarks on the motion for the provision of salaries and allowances for those serving in the independent commissions, he said the government set up these bodies in keeping with pledges made to the people at the election.
The members of the Joint Opposition started making catcalls while he was speaking. In response to them, he said those shouting had been alarmed today because the government established such commissions for good governance in the country.
He said there was no influence on the Judiciary today.
"Judges do not get telephone calls with orders today," he said.
Likewise, he said politicians could not interfere with appointments in the public service. (Kelum Bandara and Yohan Perera)

Sri Lanka, India working on ETCA
	
Sri Lanka and India are working towards signing an Economic and Technology Cooperation Agreement (ETCA), and discussions are on for the purpose, a top Sri Lankan official said.
For example, we are good at garments. We have good knowledge (on the subject) and we are good at technical skills. India has both technical and scientific advantages. For that, we want to formalise an agreement, Vadivel Krishnamoorthy, Deputy High Commissioner of Sri Lanka, Chennai, said on the sidelines of a conference.
He was speaking at a seminar on business opportunities organised by the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) and the Sri Lanka Export Development Board (SLEDB).
Mr. Krishnamoorthy said there was a huge potential for both countries to exploit the Free Trade Agreement (FTA), which was implemented in March 2000.
Its capacity is very high that what it seems to be. Our present task is to explore this huge potential and should be investigated with the assistance of the business community, he said.
Pointing out that India has become the number one supplier to the island nation overtaking countries such a Japan, Hong Kong, South Korea, Singapore, and China, the Deputy High Commissioner said.
Sri Lankan exports to India have also increased substantially, from $35.3 million in 1999 to $643 million in 2015.
The total trade between the two countries had risen to $4.9 billion in December 2015 from just $56 million in 1991. I am confident that it will cross $6 billion this year, he said. (The Hindu)

They are set to teach him a lesson
	

A plan is underway to stage a big revolt against the Western PC administration at the unveiling of its annual Budget for 2017, they say.

The JO rebels in the council took the initiative last year to oust the Heritage member Nishantha from his Ministerial office and they are now poised for a repeat performance targeting the chief purohita.
Incidentally, the Betel leaf party commands the majority in the council with more than 50 members and at least 47 of them are die-hard loyalists of the former strongman. The opposition to the current council administration among the JO loyalists simmering for some time has begun boiling when the incumbent chief purohita described as an intimate of the Big Boss started launching tirades against the former strongman from public platforms.
The rebels have now decided to upset the apple cart come the annual Budget just to teach a lesson to the chief purohita for criticizing their leader. They are likely to muster a majority vote to defeat the estimates of the Education Ministry or an expenditure item of any other Ministry now being handled by the chief purohita.
