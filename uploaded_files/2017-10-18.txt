A Hindu religious festival that wards off evil
	
Deepavali is one of the most popular and glamorous festivals celebrated by more than eight hundred million Tamils the world over. This festival is celebrated by Tamils in a bid to get their spiritual needs fulfilled and to enjoy happiness in their secular lives. It?s purely a religious festival, but it also provides opportunities for jubilation and a sense of togetherness in performing religious rites. Although it?s a Hindu festival it isn?t confined to Hindu Tamils, but is celebrated by many people regardless of religious, social, and ethnic differences to ward off the darkness of evil and to welcome the light of fortune and prosperity.??
Victory of good over evil
The festival marks victory over evil. This fact is established from a story in Purana. Demon king Narahasura had amassed a lot of power and strength by praying. This power and strength had been used by him not for good and virtuous acts, but for acts of evil. Instead of good and virtuous activities he caused untold harassment and misery to his subjects. He was arrogant and tyrannical. Even Devas and Deities could not bear the suffering caused by evil acts of king Narahasura. They prayed to Lord Krishna to destroy the evil acts and to protect the people by liberating them from the wicked hands of Narahasura. It is said in the scriptures that when unrighteousness was predominant the merciful Lord manifests himself on earth to fight for righteousness and to save the world from being destroyed.??
Narahasura Sanharaya
In answer to the prayers Lord Krishna appeared with his consort Satyabama and killed Narahasura. This is called Narahasura Sanharaya. In his death bed Narahasura repented and was regretful about his wickedness and begged the Lord that the world celebrates his death which was the end of a reign of terror and the victory of good over evil. According to legend this is how the Deepavali festival came into being.? ?
Dark half of the month of Aippasl
Since then it has become an annual celebration which falls due on the fourteenth day of the dark half of the month of Aippasl. In the eve of the festive day Hindus clean their houses and take a ritualistic bath early in the morning. In India the ritualistic bath is bathing in the Holy River Ganges - the sacred Ganga. They call this bath ?Ganga Snana?. They believe that they are immensely blessed with this bath as the filth of evil is washed away from their bodies. They wear new clothes and sing the glories of the lord. After that they engage in prayers at home and in temples.? ?
Festival of illumination
It is the belief of Hindus that the oil lamps lit by them on this holy day will burn evil and reduced it to ashes. They believe this act will bring fortune upon them. Thus this is a festival of illumination. In the evening of the festive day they light the oil lamps to invite the blessings of Goddess Laxmi. Lighting crackers in the evening is a common practice.??
Deepavali is the festival of light and has huge importance even in today?s modern world. The principles and rites related to Deepavali teach us to uphold the true values of life
Love and peace?
Deepavali is a festival celebrated with eminent faith and spirit in Sri Lanka. It isn?t only the Tamils in the North and East who partake in the celebrations, but also those who live in every nook and corner of the country. They celebrate the occasion with eminent faith and sanctity. They make figures out of crystal sugar, which take the place of sweets. Their neighbours, friends and well-wishers belonging to other communities share the feelings of joy and togetherness.??
An age old tradition?in Mauritius?
Deepavali is an age old tradition in Mauritius. This is a significant festival for natives who believe that Deepavali had been celebrated even long before the return of Rama from a fourteen-year exile and his coronation as the king. In that country the festival is marked by lighting earthen lamps in rows. Figures are made out of these rows of lamps. Goddess Lakshmi is worshiped as the Goddess of wealth and crackers are lit to scare away evil.? ?
Tihar?
In Nepal Deepavali is known as Tihar. As is done in most parts of India Deepavali is celebrated in Nepal in honour of the Goddess of wealth Goddess Lakshmi and the God of prosperity, Ganesh. In this country the festival continues for five days. The first day is set apart and is dedicated to cows with the belief that Goddess Lakshmi arrives on a cow. People cook rice and feed the cows. The second day is dedicated for dogs believing that the dog is the vehicle of Bhairava.
On this day delicious food is prepared especially for dogs. On the third day the entire surrounding is illuminated with lights and Deepavali lamps and some special items of food are prepared. Fireworks, oil lamps and crackers are lit widely during the celebrations. The fourth day is dedicated to Yuma, the Hindu God of death. Devotees pray to this God requesting for long life. The fifth and the final day is Bhagya Day which is dedicated to bless sisters with prosperity and long life.
Japan
In Japan Deepavali is celebrated in a unique way, different to that of India. Here the people go out to orchards and gardens taking with them lanterns and banners made of cloth and paper and hang them on branches of trees. People sing songs and dance throughout the night. They wear new clothes on this festive day and go boating. They sweep and clean their abodes and decorate their places of worship with beautiful wall paper to usher in the festive mood and honour auspicious beliefs related to the festival.??
Lam Krilangh
In Thailand Deepavali is known as Lam Krilangh. Devotees light Diyas or the lamps made of Banana leaves. These lamps with candles lit in them are floated in rivers. They put coins in these Diyas and burn incentive which produces a sweet smell. This produces a wonderful view when hundreds of thousands of Diyas are floated in rivers. People greet each other and exchange wishes of happy returns on this day. They also offer sweets to friends, neighbours and well wishers.??
Bali Island?
In the Island of Bali in Indonesia, Deepavali is celebrated in a grand scale as the majority of the population in this island is of Indian origin. Deepavali is one of the most revered festivals in Bali. Rituals followed by the Hindus in this country are mostly similar to those followed by their counterparts in India. In Malaysia Deepavali is known as Hari Deepavali. In this country the South Indian tradition of oil bath precedes the festival. They also visit temples and pray at their homes.
Small lamps made of clay are filled with coconut oil and are lit on the Deepavali Day to illuminate the places of worship and individual residences. This festival is celebrated in most parts of Malaysia and the traditions followed are mainly those followed in the Indian sub continent. Hindus in Malaysia invite Malaysians and Chinese residents to their homes on festive day presumably to build a sense of togetherness.? ?
Deepavali is a festival celebrated with eminent faith and spirit in Sri Lanka. It isn?t only the Tamils in the North and East who celebrate, but also those who live in every nook and corner of the country
Britain and Australia?
In Britain it?s in the cold, damp and windy season that Deepavali is celebrated by migrant Hindus from India and other Eastern countries. In spite of snowy and cold weather Deepavali is celebrated in a grand scale as Indians are the second largest ethnic minority in Britain. Deepavali is marked by visits to local temples and shrines of Goddess Lakshmi. They share sweets, burn incense sticks and light oil lamps to illuminate their homes and the surroundings with Deepavali Diyas and blow the conch shells which is followed by prayers. In Britain rituals are followed in Lakshmi temples.??
Nearly one hundred thousand Indians who have settled down in Australia make Deepavali a grand festival in that country. Although the unavailability of appropriate material is a problem for Hindus in Australia they manage to celebrate the festival by giving it some modernity, substituting electricity for?traditional oil lamps.??
South Africa?
South Africa has nearly one million immigrant Indians concentrated in the Eastern region. Most of them are from Gujarat and Tamil Nadu. Hence, celebration is more or less the same as that in India. Deepavali is celebrated in many other countries such as Netherlands, Canada, Myanmar, Singapore, Trinidad and Tobago and United Arab Emirates?.? ?
As mentioned earlier Deepavali is celebrated to invite the blessings of Goddess Lakshmi, provider of peace, prosperity, fertility, beauty, fragrance, wealth, love and many other virtues. Goddess Lakshmi possesses compassion, satisfaction or content and impassiveness or stoicism and is the wife of god Vishnu, who is a Bodhisattva and one of the triad of Hindu Gods. Hence it?s believed that Goddess Lakshmi is capable of and is anxious to bless devoted Hindus.
Peace which is the need in many parts of the world, including Sri Lanka, is a by-product of love, meaning not the Valentine day love, but spiritual love. Peace and love should be achieved through non-violence. Hatred is never appeased by hatred itself. ?Nahi verena verani?. This is the eternal law which should be emphasized on the Deepavali festival day when all of us strive for non-violence, peace and prosperity. We have the brilliant light of the sun and the mellow light of the moon and stars.??
An age-old Hindu culture
Deepavali symbolizes an age old Hindu culture which teaches us values and directs us on to the path that dispels ignorance and drive away darkness, that engulfs the light of knowledge. Deepavali is the festival of light and has huge importance even in today?s modern world. The principles and rites related to Deepavali teach us to uphold the true values of life which shouldn?t be darkened by ?Raga? carnality, ?Dwesha? hatred and ?Moha? ignorance, but should be brightened through the four Brahamanic behaviours, ?Metta? Friendliness?, ?Karuna? compassion and ?Mudita? satisfaction and ?Upekkha? impassiveness.? ?
Let us hope that the hearts of every one will be illuminated with the brilliant light of the sun and the mellow light of the moon and stars and specially with the light of lamps lit on the Deepavali day!??

AAG De Livera has ?some other questions? to ask the PM
	
Acting Attorney General Dappula De Livera at the conclusion of PCoI proceedings said yesterday he would also have some other questions to ask from the Prime Minister apart from the questions put forward by the Commission.
Responding to the statement made by the PCoI, AAG Dappula De Livera also expressed his observations.
AAG De Livera was of the view that his team of Counsel of the Attorney General?s Department assisted the Commission under Section 23 of the Commission of Inquiry Act and spearheaded the investigation pertaining to the bond inquiry with the concurrence of the Commission, as they always kept the Commission informed about the investigation.
Moving the fact that the Attorney General?s Department had to investigate the matter with limited manpower as there were only three regular CID officers supporting the? investigation, AAG De Livera said that the lack of manpower was a significant matter as they had to face numerous difficulties in the investigation process. ?I must place this on record that I have had the fullest cooperation of the entire team of the Attorney General?s Department and this effort would not have been possible if not for the team.
So we played as a real team, irrespective of the seniority, all the officers fully cooperated in this endeavour?, AAG De Livera said.
He said despite all odds that they had to face, the Attorney General?s Department officials
and the team were able to unearth and present cogent evidence. AAG De Livera also said that they did not have the cooperation of all the witnesses whom they had interviewed during the investigation. ?I think for the team the job is not over, the task is still outstanding and as far as this Commission is concerned our job is still not over. In terms of the evidence that transpired during the proceedings, we have submitted a list of 20 witnesses to the Commission dated October 10, 2017 and out of that 20, only some
of the witnesses have now testified before the Commission. But still having considered
the material we had gathered so far from the interviews with witnesses, these listed witnesses are necessary. The Prime Minister is also listed as a material witness?, AAG De Livera said.
AAG De Livera also said that he would also have some other questions to ask from the Prime Minister apart from the questions put forward to the Prime Minister by the Commission.
He said that the investigation and the interviewing of the individuals will continue
in expectation of eliciting new material to the inquiry despite the conclusion of the hearings.
The AAG emphasized the dedication of the officials of the Attorney General?s Department and the officials of the CBSL.
?There were officer who spent 16 hours of 24 hours to this inquiry?, he said. Additional Solicitor General Yasantha Kodagoda also concluding the proceedings made a statement thereafter.
ASG Kodagoda said that it was the first time in the history that the Attorney General?s
Department was able to present data extracted from phone devices to a Commission.
He also stated that the order made by the Commission with regard to the extraction of
data would also go down as a good precedent in legal history. ASG Kodagoda said that the extraction was only possible due to the several experts obtained by the CID, who were not attached to the Commission. ?I must say this. We are continuing this process to unearth some more material, which we hope to present to the Commission if that opportunity will be given by the Commission?, ASG Kodagoda said.
He also said ?If we don?t get that opportunity, this would then be a half baked cake. Therefore we would like the President and the General public to receive a fully baked cake in the form of a report. So, please do give us that opportunity of presenting that additional telephone details? ?Several months ago, I said the main corporate entity of Perpetual Treasuries Ltd was a criminal organization. But I was shouted out by some learned counsel when I said it three months ago.
As at today, based on the cogent evidence placed before the Commission it is evident that PTL is a criminal organization?, ASG Kodagoda said. (Shehan Chamika Silva)

Cost of living: Yapa critical about govt. mechanism
	
Disaster Management Minister Anura Priyadarshana Yapa was critical of the government?s current mechanisms established to contain the rising cost of living, at yesterday?s Cabinet meeting.
The Cabinet met with President Maithripala Sirisena in the chair. Asked about what happened, Mr. Yapa told Daily Mirror that he said the mechanism had not yielded, and therefore new measures had to be worked out.
The Minister said SATHOSA, the state-owned retail chain, could not make an impact in bringing down the prices of essential items.
?SATHOSA alone cannot address the issue. There should be a system involving all the stakeholders to control the prices. The price is determined according to the supply and demand. When there is a shortfall in supply of any item, it has to be increased. We need a mechanism for it,? he said.
Commenting coconut prices, he said the retail price had shot up due to the crop failure.
?There is a crop failure due to the dry spell. Again, we need to introduce drip irrigation for coconut cultivations during dry months. We also need to address rice shortage. When we identify any shortage in local production, it has to be filled with imports to control prices,? he said. (Kelum Bandara)

Debate no-faith motion against Rajitha before Budget: JO
	
Joint opposition MP Dinesh Gunawardane said yesterday the no-confidence motion submitted in parliament against Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne should be taken up for debate before the budget even at a special parliamentary session.
He said a no-faith motion should be given priority according to Parliament Standing Orders.
"This matter has been discussed at several meetings of party leaders and was included in the order paper as well as such it should be taken for debate before the budget, if necessary by even convening a special parliamentary session," he said.
MP Mahindananda Aluthgamage said it was House Leader Lakshman Kiriella who was not allocating a date for the debate.
Chief Opposition Whip Anura Kumara Dissanayake said Mr. Kiriella was delaying to fix a date for the debate saying related matters have been mentioned in several court cases.
He said it was only mentioned with regard to some details being asked for in a court case.
"It is a wrong argument. It is sufficient to submit a no-faith motion if he had neglected to submit details required in a court case," Mr. Dissanayake said and added that the no-faith motion was included in the order paper after making necessary amendments on the advice of the Attorney General.

Lives of UMA OYA VICTIMS STILL IN CHAOTIC STATE
	
?
	Badulla District Secretary Abeysiri confirmed with the?Dailymirror?that he had received Rs.600 million to be distributed among the victims
	
	
	Although there are more than 2400 damaged houses which need repair only 23% of these houses had received compensation. The compensation
	
	
	It?s also learned that although compensation has to be provided regarding 2467 houses, payments had only been paid regarding 106 houses
	
?
Officials of the Badulla District Secretariat have made the lives of Uma Oya victims more vulnerable than ever. Despite of the present regime?s efforts to provide these victims with comfort, a harsh move initiated by the Badulla District Secretary has sent these helpless people sliding from the frying pan into the fire. All this is the result of an unorthodox move initiated by the secretary not to fully implement the promised relief scheme proposed for these victims. This development also spells bad news for the victims given that monsoon rains are around the corner.
Allegations are levelled against the Badulla District Secretary largely for failing to provide the victims, the ones to be relocated immediately, with the cabinet approved Rs.25, 000 house rent. He is also blamed for not constructing temporary shelters for these people and not providing the infrastructure facilities to the selected schools where the people are to be sheltered in the event of a catastrophe.?
?
Badulla District Secretary Abeysiri confirmed with the Daily Mirror that he had received Rs.600 million to be distributed among the victims, out of which?Rs.55.5 million had been spent as at October 16. ?
?
Badulla District Secretary Nimal Abeysiri had also allegedly obtained further funds from the Mahaweli Development Ministry in September and October through subject Minister President Maithripala Sirisena to the tune of Rs.200 million. He has obtained these monies after claiming that the compensation programme had come to a standstill due to lack of funds.?
?
?Although more than Rs100 million was lying with the coffers of the District Secretariat, the District Secretary, by a letter dated September 11, had informed the Mahaweli Development Ministry that the compensation programme had to be stopped due to lack of funds. The Ministry Secretary responded to this letter on September 13 by releasing Rs.100 million. There are further allegations that another request had been made through a fax on October 9 requesting for more funds to which the Ministry Secretary had responded by releasing another Rs.100 million the following day,? a Senior Official of the Badulla District Secretariat alleged.? ?
Badulla District Secretary Abeysiri confirmed with the?Dailymirror that he had received Rs.600 million to be distributed among the victims, out of which Rs.55.5 million had been spent as at October 16.? ?
?Although the decision taken by President Sirisena was approved by the Cabinet of Ministers on the recommendations made by the three member ministerial subcommittee, comprising Minister of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development and State Minister of Mahaweli Development Mahinda Amaraweera, Minister of Irrigation and Water Resource Management Vijith Wijayamuni Soysa and Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka, to provide relief measures to these affected people, the District Secretary?s alleged attempts to retain the funds without them being properly dispatched have raised eyebrows in the Mahaweli Development Ministry, it is learned.? ?
Mahaweli Development Ministry Secretary Anura Dissanayake told the?Dailymirror that as and when a request is made by the District Secretary, a letter of advice is sent to the national treasury to release funds.? ?
?We have to respond promptly once a request is received and on my advice the treasury releases the necessary funds. To my knowledge we have released Rs.600 million to provide compensation and fund other infrastructure facilities for people in the affected areas,? Dissanayake said.? ?
When told that there are allegations against the District Secretary for not carrying out Government directives, Dissanayake said that he was unaware of it and added that he wanted to obtain the information from the Deputy Director of the Uma Oya?Relief Centre.? ?
It?s also learned that although compensation has to be provided regarding 2467 houses, considering a period between July 20 to October 15, payments had only been paid regarding 106 houses.? ?
?Out of 1175 damaged houses in Bandarawela, house rentals not exceeding Rs.15, 000 (each) had been paid regarding 46 houses while 59 families in Haputale had received only Rs.15, 000 each. Since the house rentals in these areas had risen rapidly due to the huge demand, those who were living in high risk areas have moved into rented out houses. The rent for these houses cost between Rs.15, 000 to Rs.25, 000,? sources said.? ?
These sources further said that although there are more than 2400 damaged houses which need repair only 23% of these houses had received compensation. The compensation paid to each of these houses is less than Rs.10, 000.? ?
?Rs 10,000 each was paid in connection with the 565 houses. An amount between Rs 10,000- 50,000 each was paid regarding 1120 houses while another payment between Rs 50,000-100,000 each was made regarding 416 houses. On an average, 85% of the damaged houses have received less than Rs.100, 000 while the compensation paid to 250 families was between Rs.100, 000 to Rs.500, 000, but these families too are living in rented houses as the money paid to them isn?t sufficient even to buy the necessary building materials,? the sources claimed.? ?
Executive Director Human Rights and Research Centre (Sri Lanka) Keerthi Tennakoon too criticized District Secretary Abeysiri for not addressing the grievances of the Uma Oya victims. His criticism comes in the wake of the ground situation in the Grama Niladhari Division in the area which is expected to worsen further with the expected north eastern monsoon rains. ?Unless these people are relocated by paying them the cabinet approved housing rentals without delay, there is an impending tragedy which will be far more disastrous than the Meetotamulla debacle. It is questionable as to why the District Secretary is blatantly ignoring Presidential directives,? Tennakoon queried.? ?
According to the Finance Progress Report of the Badulla District Secretariat, Rs.399.98 million had been utilized as at October 9, 2017 to pay compensation and purchase of water tanks for Bandarawela, Ella, Haputale, Welimada, Hali Ela, and Uva Paranagama Divisional Secretariats.? ?
According to the District Secretary, he was in receipt of Rs.500 million by October 9, since the relief programme?s inception. However according to the Finance Progress Report, the total amount he had received as at October 9 was Rs.400 million which contradicts the statement made to this paper by the District Secretary. Critics query why this official, after spending Rs 399.987 million out of the Rs.500 million in the fund, by October 9, made him request for another Rs. 100 million from the Mahaweli Development Ministry on October 9 to which the Treasury had complied, the following day.? ?
According to the Finance Progress Report, Rs.180.882 million had been spent as compensation in Bandarawela between July 20 to September 6, 2017, Rs.172.542 million in Ella between July 18 to September 13, Rs.5.081 million in Haputale between August 24 to September 6, Rs.18.631 million in Welimada between August 22 and September 13, Rs.2.397 million in Hali Ela between August 25 to September 13, and Rs.513,500 in Uva Paranagama between August 30 to September 6 which makes the total amount paid as compensation added up to Rs.380.048 million. In addition another Rs.19.939 million had been spent on purchasing 4, 045 water tanks and the total expenditure incurred as at October 9, 2017, according to the report, was Rs.399.987 million.? ?
Janaka Nilanpriya, a resident in Kinigama, Bandarawela, told this newspaper how he was denied of the housing rental he is entitled to by the Divisional Secretary Bandarawela over the past few months. This was after he had received notice to evacuate his house.? ?
?By letter (Ref:UMO/PRCO/GE) dated September 6, Deputy Director Uma Oya Relief Centre P.B. Amarasekera had written to the Divisional Secretary Bandarawela, to evacuate my family immediately on the recommendation of the Chief Engineer Uma Oya Relief Centre. He had recommended the District Secretary Badulla a payment of Rs.90,000 as house rentals for six months, but to date I haven?t been paid they claim there is a lack of funds. Even the people in the area don?t have faith in the Government when it comes to valuing the damage caused to our houses. Although deep cracks are visible on the ground floor as well as in the upper floor in my residence, the valuation team that came didn?t check all the damages that had been caused to my entire house. They took note of only 22 cracks on the walls. After that I made a complaint with the Bandarawela Police who found out that there were 34 deep cracks in the entire house. Although the compensation recommended to my house was Rs.150, 000 later the figure was brought down to Rs.75, 000 since I had lodged a complaint against them with the police, which I didn?t accept. Since I wasn?t paid the housing rental I wanted the Divisional Secretary to provide me with temporary shelter so that I could move, but that request too was turned down,? Nilanpriya said.? ?
Meanwhile Divisional Secretary Bandarawela Nihal Gunaratne said that he is awaiting allocations to be made by the Badulla District Secretariat so that compensation can be paid to the victims. ?There is a delay in obtaining the funds and once they are received we will be distributing them among the victims based on the recommendation reports submitted by the relevant departments,? Gunaratne added.? ?
Meanwhile Water Resources Board Chairman A.C.M. Zulficar said that the Government had granted Rs.89 million to install six large scale tube wells and to carry out a hydro geological survey to obtain the water levels in the ground. ?Later the tube well project was stopped due to various reasons and now there is a plan to provide water from Demodara. The lack of water bowsers and drivers had affected the distribution of water,? Zulficar said.? ?
It is alleged that a certain high ranking officer of the Government, in the district, is behind the move to stop the tube well project because he hopes to receive commission from owners of private water bowsers who sell water to the people. When asked how true the allegation is, the Water Resources Board Chairman said that although he knows that water is now sold to the people by a few private bowser owners, he is unaware of any Government official?s involvement in the water business.??
?
?I?ve carried out my duties to the expectations of the Govt.?
Nimal Abeysiri - District Secretary Badulla
Refuting allegations, District Secretary Badulla Nimal Abeysiri said that he hasn?t retained unutilized funds in the District Secretariat account and added that he had dispatched the funds among all Divisional Secretariats, amounting to Rs.555 million, which he had done since July this year.? ?
?I was vested with powers to handle this project by the Cabinet and received the first installment which amounted to Rs.300 million by June 17, 2017 and another Rs.100 million later regarding which I can?t recall the date without checking documents. Then again I was sent another Rs.100 million on September 13 and once again a similar amount on October 10 by the Mahaweli Development Ministry Secretary,? Abeysiri said.? ?
When asked as to why the tube well project was halted, a move which has adversely affected the people who have no other options but to ?buy? water from private suppliers, the District Secretary said that it had been stopped after taking into consideration the recommendation of the environmental reports.? ?
?People protested against the drilling that was required to install the tube wells. At a recent meeting, headed by the State Minister of Mahaweli Development Mahinda Amaraweera, this decision was taken although parties with a vested interest are pointing fingers at me. I have carried out my duties to the expectations of the Government and the victims,? Abeysiri added.?

No need of a new Constitution or Amendments - Malwatu & Asgiriya Chapters
	
The Karaka Maha Sangha Sabha, of the Malwatu & Asgiriya Chapters today decided that there was no necessity of a new Constitution or amendments to the present Constitution of the country and urged to stop the Constitution drafting process.
The decision has been taken during a special meeting held at the Dalada Maligawa, Kandy yesterday evening, with the participation by the members of the Karaka Maha Sangha Sabha of the Asgiriya and Malwatu Chapters led by Anunayake of the Malwatte Maha Vihare, Ven. Dimbulkumbure Wimaladharma Thera, Anunayakes of the Asgiriya Maha Vihare Ven. Wedaruwe Upali Thera and Anamaduwe Sri Dammadassi Nayaka Thera.
Following a two-hour meeting, Anunayake of the Malwatte Maha Vihare, Ven. Dimbulkumbure Wimaladharma Thera told the media that the proposed Constitution was not suitable as it leads to division of power including the assigning of powers to the Provincial Councils and Pradeshiya Sabhas, which were not entertained even by Parliament.
?We have decided the unsuitability of the proposed Constitution. We say that a new Constitution is not needed. The present Constitution is good for us. We will express protest of the Maha Sangha after briefing the Mahanayakes of the Asgiriya and Malwathu Chapters, Ramannaya and Amarapura Nikayas. We urge the government to stop the drafting process immediately. The present Constitution is better for us. President?s powers should be intact. But a electoral system based on first-past-the- post system also should be there. We decided that the Maha Sangha should oppose the proposed Constitution,? the Thera said.
Asgiriya Chapter Lekakadikari Dr. Medagama Sri Dhammananda Thera said introducing a new Constitution at this juncture would lead to a racial and communal division.
?The proposals made in the proposed Constitution were detrimental to the unitary state concept and decentralization of state power would create a serious situation. It is evident that the country would be divided,? he said. (Text and pix by J.A.L. Jayasinghe)

Once a month to a foreign city just for a night-out
	
?
Believe it or not! A yahapalanaya purohita had made it a practice to make a round-trip to a destination in a neighboring country once a month for the past several months in a row just for a night-out!?
Diplomatic sources have been mystified when it had come to light that this purohita hailing from a district bordering Wilpattu used to enplane for one particular destination in an evening and would fly back home the following day, once a month.? ?
?
The purohita had failed to inform the authorities both here and in the host country about this shuttle trip despite using a diplomatic passport for the purpose which a government source described as a serious breach of diplomatic protocol.??
The same source said a special investigation had already been launched into the mysterious round-trip overseas made by the purohita on a regular basis keeping authorities in both countries in the dark.?
?The investigation will help unearth the reason for this unusual regular trip,? he added.??

Possibility of holding LG polls in Jan. receding
	
The possibility of conducting the elections to the local authorities in January, next year is now receding because the government has decided to introduce yet another piece of legislation to hold the elections to two Pradeshiya Sabhas in the North under the new electoral system.
The elections to the two local authorities in the Wanni district ? Puthukuduiruppu and Maritime Pattu were not conducted in 2010. In the meantime, the government enacted fresh legislation in 2012 for a new electoral system ? a mix of the First Past the Post System and the Proportional Representation System.
However, these two local bodies were exempted from the new law. But the government has now decided to conduct the elections to these two local bodies under the new system. The Cabinet is reported to have discussed this matter and decided to draft new legislation to enable this process.
Against the backdrop, it is now unlikely that the elections could be held in January.
The government has also decided to set up new local authorities in the Nuwara-Eliya District on a request by the Tamil Progressive Alliance. (Kelum Bandara)

Samuel says ?I don?t know? who RK, AM, Hon PM are
	
The Bond Commission today observed that the personal Assistant of Arjun Aloysius, Steve Samuel was lying before the Commission and said that in the event they found him to be doing so ?appropriate action would be taken against him?.
Justice Prasanna Jayawardena made this remark after Samuel repeatedly denied any knowledge of the contents of the text messages sent by him which referred to RK, AM, Arjun M, Ravi K, Hon PM, A Mahendran and Ravi Karunanayake.
?No I don?t know? he said each time he was questioned on the text messages by Dr. Avanthi Perera Senior State Counsel.
At the end of the evidence Justice Jayawardena sarcastically said: ? We would like to have him (Samuel ) educate us on how to forget things. You know it?s a remarkable skill?
At the onset of the yesterday?s proceedings, Arjun Aloysius? personal assistant, Steve Samuel testified before the Commission regarding several text messages and e-mails which were extracted from Aloysius? phone by the CID.
These text messages and e-mails had been sent by Steve Samuel to his boss, Aloysius.
According to the witness, Samuel had joined Perpetual Capital Holdings in November 2016 and had served as the personal assistant of Arjun Aloysius and thereafter Geoffrey Aloysius.
Senior State Counsel Dr. Avanti Perera questioned the witness showing several text messages and emails.
Senior State Counsel Dr Avanti Perera: These text messages were sent by you, right?
Witness Steve Samuel: I cannot recall exactly.
Then the senior state counsel read the first text message.
Witness: Yes, that was a text message sent by me to Aloysius.
Text message 1 (Serial number 8309) ? Samuel to Aloysius- Date : November 28, 2016
?Reminder to request Hon PM and RK to get a copy of the monetary board meeting/papers need to be submitted today 28??
		Senior State Counsel Dr. Avanti Perera: This message was sent by you, right?
Witness: I cannot recall exactly. But I think I got a call from the general line that day and I was asked to send this message.
Justice Prasanna Jayawardena: Who called you through the general line?
Witness: I cannot recall that exactly at this moment.
Justice Jayawardena: Was it Arjun Aloysius or anybody else?
W: I don?t know. Honestly I cannot remember.
At this moment, when Counsel Chanaka de Silva asked the Commission whether the date of the text message was relevant with the proceedings, Justice Jayawardena said ?This was the date on which some event happened?.
Additional Solicitor General Yasantha Kodagoda at this moment said ?the day was relating to Perpetual Treasuries Ltd. And that was the day that regulatory decisions had been taken against PTL by the CBSL.?
At this moment the witness said that he had no clue whatsoever regarding the company activities of the PTL and he just noted down things only that were asked to be done by Aloysius.
Justice Jayawardena replying said that nobody would blame him doing his job as the personal assistant of Aloysius and the Commission only requires him to answer the questions precisely.
Senior State Counsel Dr Avanti Perera: Do you understand what the abbreviation ?Hon PM? stands for?
W: No
Senior State Counsel Dr Avanti Perera: If I suggest to you that it was the Prime Minister, would you accept that?
W: I cannot accept that because I didn?t know what that meant, so, I cannot comment on that.
Senior State Counsel Dr Avanti Perera: Would you know what abbreviation ?RK? stood for?
W: No
SSC Dr Avanti Perera: So, your position is you received instructions through the general phone line and you noted them down and sent back to Aloysius, right?
W: Yes
Text message 2 (Serial number 9039) ? Samuel to Aloysius- Date : December 1, 2016
?GM Chairman, hope you had a very good meeting with ?RK?, just update when you and I can meet before you leave tonight?
		SSC Dr Avanti Perera: Now, in this text message you have mentioned ?hope you had a very good meeting with RK?. Is it your position still that you don?t know who ?RK? is?
W: No. I don?t know
SSC Dr Avanti Perera: Could you explain why you would say ?hope you had a good meeting??
W: That is the normal way I asked as the personal assistant
Justice Jayawardena: obviously, you would have known that Aloysius was having a meeting with Mr. RK or Mrs RK, right?
W: I don?t know whether it was Mr. or Mrs.
Justice Jayawardena: As a primary dealer, Aloysius would have dealt with the Ministry of Finance regularly, right?
W: That I don?t know. He doesn?t tell me about his meetings. And I have never gone to his meetings.
Justice Jayawardena: So, in any event you knew that Aloysius had a meeting with some RK, right?
W: Yes
J: Who could be that significant ?RK??
W: That I don?t know
Text message 3 (Serial number 6364) ?Aloysius to Samuel- Date : 
?Steve please remind me to talk to ?RK? on two matters when I meet him tomorrow
			1. PPP units set up
			2. Two meetings with PM tomorrow at 4 with US treasurer?
		SSC Dr Avanti Perera: Do you know who ?RK? is?
W: No
SSC Dr Avanti Perera: Do you know who ?PM? is?
W: No
Justice Jayawardena: PPP stands for Public Private Partnerships, was that correct?
Witness in a hesitant manner said that he doesn?t know.
Justice Jayawardena: This text message says about a meeting with US treasurer. So, who would meet US Treasurer?
W: I don?t know I was not in this country before I joined the job. (He said he was a cabin crew staff employee of an airline in the Middle East for 25 years)
SSC Dr Avanti Perera: In your statement given to the police at the Commission?s premises you have responded to a question as to who was ?PM? and ?RK.? You had said that ?I?m not sure but perhaps it could be the Hon. Prime Minister?, so now would you accept that it was Prime Minister?
W: I can?t accept it. That is why I had said ?perhaps?, because I don?t know. Nobody told me that PM is Hon. Prime Minister.
SSC Dr Avanti Perera: Anyway, would you accept that ?RK? and ?PM? are persons with whom Aloyius had contacts?
W: Because as per my messages it looks so (in a hesitant manner told).
SSC Dr Avanti Perera: Who else would stand for ?PM? in your opinion?
W: I would not know. I just noted abbreviations pointed out by Aloysius.
At this point perusing the forensic extraction document Justice Prasanna Jayawardena in a sarcastic manner added amusement to the query asking the witness ?Who is this Rohitha Abeygoonawardena? Who would that be? RA?
Text message 4? and an E-mail correspondence (Serial number 4050) ?Samuel to Aloysius- Date : November 6, 2016
Reminder: follow up meeting with Ravi Karunanayake at 9 a.m.
		SSC Dr Avanti Perera: What are the initials of that person in this text message?
Witness was silent and perusing the document the State Counsel again asked
SSC Dr Avanti Perera: What are the two letters in that name?
Witness was not answering
SSC Dr Avanti Perera: Was that RK, right?
W: Yes
SSC Dr Avanti Perera: Now looking at this message would you be able to refer RK to the same person as Ravi Karunanayake?
W: I cannot acknowledge that because how would I know. I was given only abbreviations as ?RK? but here it was told to me as Ravi Karunanayake so I mentioned it
SSC Dr Avanti Perera: Now, here Aloysius was going to have a follow up meeting with Ravi Karunanayake, so it was a follow up meeting, right? There would have been a meeting before that, right?
W: He has told me to give a reminder about a follow up meeting which I did
SSC Dr Avanti Perera: Do you know who Ravi Karunanayake is in this country?
W: At the moment yes. He was the former Finance Minister.
Two text messages 5 & 6 (Serial numbers 4020 and 4023) ?Samuel to Aloysius- Date : November 8, 2016
			Serial numbers 4020
			Reminder: Next meeting at 7 a.m. with ?Ravi K?

W: Yes
Text message 7 ?Samuel to Aloysius- Date : November 9, 2016
Ravi K tonight?
		SSC Dr Avanti Perera: Is this message correct?
W: Yes
Text message 8? (Serial number 3842)?Samuel to Aloysius- Date : November 17, 2016
Reminder a meeting with RK at 7.30 pm
		SSC Dr Avanti Perera: Now it appears that Arjun Aloysius had met RK or Ravi Karunanayake whoever that may be, on several times in November 2016, is that correct?
W: Yes
SSC Dr Avanti Perera: Do you know what those meetings were about?
W: No
Text message 9? (Serial number 3769)?Samuel to Aloysius- Date : November 22, 2016
			
			Reminder: I do have it on my notes for today RK/ TO DO LIST
			
			
		SSC Dr Avanti Perera: Do you have any idea what this list was?
W: No
SSC Dr Avanti Perera: Do you know who constructed the RK list?
W: No
SSC Dr Avanti Perera: So, it was not by you?
W: No
SSC Dr Avanti Perera: If that list was not prepared by you, then it appears that this already existed before you came into employment at PTL, is that correct?
W: That I cannot comment
Text message 10? (Serial number 3766)?Samuel to Aloysius- Date : November 22, 2016
			
			We have the ?A Mahendran? to do list
			
			
		SSC Dr Avanti Perera: Do you know who this ?A Mahendran? was?
W: Anjali Mahendran (daughter of Arjuna Mahendran and the wife of Aloysius)
SSC Dr Avanti Perera: You are very sure about that, right?
W: Yes
SSC Dr Avanti Perera: So, in this case you are very familiar with the abbreviation as opposed to ?RK?, right?
W: I know Anjali Mahendran
SSC Dr Avanti Perera: But this says ?A Mahendran??
W: I call her A Mahendran
SSC Dr Avanti Perera: So you call her face to face A Mahendran was it?
W: No. I meant when I note it down
SSC Dr Avanti Perera: And would that be the only person that you would write in abbreviation as ?A Mahendran??
W: Yes
SSC Dr Avanti Perera: So, since you are very familiar with this Anjali Mahendran, what is this ?to do list to Anjali Mahendran??
At this point President?s Counsel Anuja Premaratne objected to the question and said that was something relating to his client?s wife.
The Commission also emphasized that it has nothing to do with the matters relating to Aloysius and his wife.
SSC Dr Avanti Perera: Do you know the name of Anjali Mahendran?s father?
W: Arjuna Mahendran
SSC Dr Avanti Perera: So, could it not be him?
W: I don?t know because I don?t do any correspondence for Arjuna Mahendran
SSC Dr Avanti Perera: That is so, but this appears to be a file you are reminding Arjun Aloysius about? Anyway we will come to that.
Text message 11? (Serial number 3754)?Samuel to Aloysius- Date : November 22, 2016
			
			Chairman, awaiting an update on today ?to do list for Arjuna M? and ?RK?
			
			
		SSC Dr Avanti Perera: Now, this text message says ?Arjuna M?, In this case who would be ?Arjuna M??
W: I don?t know
SSC Dr Avanti Perera: Didn?t you just say that you are aware of the father of Anjali Mahendran is Arjuna Mahendran?
W: Yes
SSC Dr Avanti Perera: So, would this not be reference to Arjun Mahendran?
W: This just says ?Arjuna M? so I cannot admit that it was Arjuna Mahendran
SSC Dr Avanti Perera: So, when it was A Mahendran you are familiar that it was Anjali Mahendran but when it was ?Arjuna M? you do not know who that was, is that your position?
W: Yes
Text message 12? Samuel to Aloysius- Date : November 22, 2016

SSC Dr Avanti Perera: Again is that your position that you don?t know who ?Hon. PM? is?

W: Not clearly
Justice Jayawardena: Now, you have worked with Aloysius for the last few years, right? Other than the time period you were in hospital, you would have worked with Aloysius, right?
W: Yes
Justice Jayawardena: You would have been talking with him on what things to done for him as well, right?
W: Yes
Justice Jayawardena: And you would have also told him that you were summoned to give evidence as well, right?
W: Yes
Justice Jayawardena: And he knew that you were coming to give evidence and we were told that you were here through PTL, right?

As per ?Dilshad? there is no London trip scheduled anywhere
		SSC Dr Avanti Perera: Whose schedule are you referring?

SSC Dr Avanti Perera: Could that be the Minister of Finance?
W: Not sure
At this moment Justice Jayawardena asked Additional Solicitor General Yasantha Kodagoda to put the relevant text messages to the witness as he had admitted that he had sent them.
?Now witness admits that he had originated the text messages and sent them to Aloysius, so are we to now blindly accept the fact that he had sent them without knowing the meaning of the content?, ASG Kodagoda asked.
Justice Jayawardena: It is very clear to us exactly who he was talking about.
ASG Kodagoda: And he is lying under oath.
Justice Jayawardena: We will take the appropriate steps on that.
ASG Kodagoda: If the commission is so aware of the fact that he is misleading the Commission, then it would be fine.
Justice Jayawardena: It is very clear.
ASG Kodagoda: That, he is lying.
Justice Jayawardena: That we cannot say now, because that would accuse us for prejudging, but his evidence is very clear.
Justice Jayawardena then questioned the witness again and asked whether he knew at the time he was sending these messages about the content and the people he was referring to. The witness? answer was affirmative. The witness also said that he cannot recall them at the moment.

Samuel pleaded that he was unaware about the names that transpired in the text messages as he had only done what he was asked to do.
He also said that he had not maintained any of files on behalf of PTL hence there was no file in the custody of him at the moment.
After the conclusion of the evidence of Steve Samuel, while he was getting off from the witness dock, Justice Prasanna Jayawardena in a sarcastic manner quipped to Samuel?s Counsel ?Bring him (Samuel) here one day to educate us also on how to forget things, it?s a remarkable talent?

SL-Pakistan hold talks on bilateral political consultations
	
The Fifth Round of Foreign Secretaries Level Bilateral Political Consultations between Pakistan and Sri Lanka was held in Colombo on Tuesday.
Pakistan delegation was headed by Foreign Secretary Tehmina Janjua while the Sri Lankan delegation was led by Foreign Secretary Prasad Kariyawasam.
In a statement, the Pakistan High Commission said both the Foreign Secretaries noted with satisfaction the close and friendly relations, routed in history which have strengthened over the years.
?It was agreed to further consolidate the bilateral relations in all areas of mutual importance. The two sides reviewed the entire gamut of bilateral relations. The prospects of cooperation in trade, investment, defence, education, science and technology, culture, tourism, capacity building, immigration issues and sports were discussed in detail. The two sides also reviewed legal, protocol and consular matters,? it said.
The two parties had agreed that the Joint Working Groups would oversee the implementation of the Agreements/MoUs signed between the two countries.
?Both sides concurred to expand the ambit of Pakistan Sri Lanka Free Trade Agreement (PSFTA). Sri Lanka welcomed the extension of Credit Lines of US $ 200 Million and US $ 10 Million by Pakistan and it was agreed to ensure their early implementation,? the statement said.
It said Foreign Secretary Janjua highlighted the ?grave? human rights violations perpetrated by the Indian Occupation Forces in Indian Occupied Jammu & Kashmir against the innocent Kashmiris.
?She emphasized that the international community should urge India to immediately put an end to these atrocities and to ensure the early resolution of the Jammu & Kashmir dispute, as per the UN Security Council Resolutions,? it said.
The next round of consultations would be held in Islamabad in October, 2018.

?Sudu Nelum? author in action again
	
?
A new electronic media channel dedicated to the cause of promoting national reconciliation is set to be launched shortly, reports say.
?
Preparations are now underway to construct special studios both in the North and the South and tenders for some work in this connection have already been called.
The proposed electronic media channel, they say, is yet another initiative by the Innocent One of Sudu Nelum fame for promoting national reconciliation ahead of the adoption of the proposed new Constitution and holding of a Referendum or an overdue national poll.
However, according to those directly involved in the project, the completion of the project is likely to take three to four months and the chances of meeting the deadline set by the purohita are remote.? ?
The new electronic media channel is estimated to cost some Rs.180 million, they say.

?
Yahapalanaya is planning to wash its hands off the stinking treasury bond scam by staging the act of giving walking papers to two fall guys.
?
One guy is a top advisor of the government who held high office some time ago. The other one is a secretarial one of a key Ministry considered a finance wizard, who is now on a service extension which is due to expire come December.? The sin attributed to the duo is sitting on a committee initially appointed to probe the bond scam.?
Some senior purohitas had pointed out that the yahapalanaya got tainted with the bond scam because of these two white collar ones. The twosome will be replaced by new appointees shortly, they predict.?

Following these reports, a group of Betel leaf seniors had called on Number One to find out whether the two purohitas met him as reported.? Number One who had greeted their query with a loud guffaw had reportedly replied: ?They never saw me. Nor would any purpose have served by seeing me?

We will defeat Maithri if contested again: JVP
	
While claiming that President Maithripala Sirisena had no moral right to contest the presidential election again, the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) said today they would defeat him just as the former president Mahinda Rajapaksa if he contested the election breaking his pledge to the people.
JVP MP Vijitha Herath said the President should reveal his stance on the abolishing of the executive presidency.
?President Sirisena said there would be no presidential election again. He reaffirmed it at the cremation of Ven. Maduluwawe Sobitha Thera. He has no moral right to contest the presidential election again whatever the SLFP stance would be. He should keep the promise made to the people,? he said.
Mr. Herath told a news conference that the JVP had submitted nine amendments to the interim report submitted by the Steering Committee in the Constitutional Assembly including the abolishment of the executive presidency.
He said the draft bill of the Constitution would be based on the matters agreed by all parties whereas there had been different views on it.
?The Draft Bill of the Constitution would not be based on contradictory views. It would only be based on the matters agreed by all parties. We as the JVP assure the people that we will never allow anyone to divide the country,? he said.
?Different people hold different views on the interim report. There had been different views on executive presidency, state structure, the priority given to Buddhism, unitary state, power of the governor and power of Provincial Councils. All these matters are under discussion,? he said.
He said certain bankrupt political forces were trying to create bugbear among the people on the interim report and asked them not to get deceived by such groups.(Ajith Siriwardana)

Will he lose the party title too?
	
?
Several Green stalwarts are said to be pressing that the Bondman now sans a portfolio be stripped of his party title as well.
?
A wearer of a deputy mantle in the party, the livewire behind this move, is set to take up the matter with the Green leader on his return home from the foreign visit.
Meanwhile, the Bondman has come in for further flak for his alleged underhand moves to build a power base as the leader of the backbenchers.
Given the Bondman?s fall from grace on all fronts, the title he is currently holding in the party is likely to be offered to an elderly senior at the party?s forthcoming national convention to be held in the gem city, they say.?

Will join anti-SAITM forces if solution not found: Rathana Thera
	
Parliamentarian Ven. Athuraliye Rathana Thera said today that he would join hands with students of medical faculties and their parents in their struggle against the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) if the government did not act in a flexible manner to resolve the issue within the next two weeks.
The thera warned instead of going for more discussions with the government on the issue he would join anti-SAITM forces in their fight to abolish the campus if the government keeps delaying finding a solution to the problem.
The thera made these remark when representatives of the Medical Faculty Students? Parents? Association (MFSPA) and students of medical faculties visited him in Colombo yesterday (18).
?It has been almost three years since the new government came to power. I don?t believe that the matter should dragged on any further. Already students are getting jailed and baton-charged and very soon it could end with one or more fatalities. Students do not deserve this,? the thera said.
The Venerable thera said the government should listen to all stakeholders of the SAITM issue including the doctors and if it has an impartial proposal to resolve the issue it should be presented forthwith.
The thera said that he would lend his support to the cause if the government did not change its stance on the issue immediately. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

You will be safe: Driver of attacked Lahore bus
	
The driver of the bus which carried the Sri Lankan cricket team to Gaddafi Stadium in Lahore when it came under fire by terrorists, said the situation in Pakistan has changed and Sri Lankan players would be safe.
In an interview with the Indian Express, Meher Muhammad Khaleel has said he would be driving the team again to the stadium and requested them not worry about their safety.
?It?s so easy for people to say play here but only those who went through that experience can understand that: fear and terror that they went through is not easy to forget. I can understand that. But my request to them is that the situation is better: the army is with you, our people are with you, you will be safe,? he said.
Six members of the Lankan team were injured, six Pakistani policemen and two civilians were killed in the attack on March, 2009.
Recalling the day, Khaleel said that when the attackers opened fire, he thought it was celebratory fireworks. But soon he saw, in the mirror, that the Sri Lankan players had dived to either side of the aisle.
He said he then saw a man on the street shoot at the bus. ?One went through the glass, one flew by, and I heard the players say, ?Go, go, go?. It jolted me and I decided to drive ahead. To rush ahead an eight-cylinder bus on second gear wasn?t easy but I knew I had to escape the scene. They were 10-15 of them, I think, and grouped in twos.?
Later, after a few hours, he heard that the Sri Lankans, who were taken to the airbase, said they wouldn?t leave the country without thanking him. Khaleel was at the police station then, and the Pakistan Cricket Board took him to the players. ?Muralitharan, Sangakkara, Mendis, Samaraweera, Mahela were there, and they gave me so much love and respect ? they also stuffed whatever money they had in an envelope and gave it to me.?
Khaleel would later go as guest of honour to Sri Lanka and spend 10 days there meeting with families of all cricketers.
?When I went to a public function or even to shopping in a mall, I remember people shouting, ?Hero! Hero! Hero!? It felt really good. I was also invited for dinner with their president.?
Then he went to South Africa and stayed there for two more years. Before he moved to South Africa to live, he was there on a visit when he heard players like Mahela Jayawardene were there for a tournament.
?So I called the hotel but one can?t reach a player. I told the receptionist who I was, gave my number and asked it to be given to Mahela. He called me soon, and said, ?Oh, Muhammad bhai, where are you? And when I told him I was right there, he asked me to come over. We had a great time, he gave me tickets to an IPL game also. I also saw MS Dhoni and Suresh Raina that time; Raina spoke very warmly and Dhoni said, ?you are so brave, you saved them,?
On his return to Pakistan, Khaleel resumed driving the bus. When Zimbabwe toured the country in 2015, he drove them to the stadium. Earlier this year, he was again on duty when the World XI landed in Pakistan. Now, he waits for Sri Lanka.
