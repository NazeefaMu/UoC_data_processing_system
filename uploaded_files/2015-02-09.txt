27 EtthukalaTechnical College students taken ill
	
Twenty seven students of a technical education institution in Etthukala were taken ill in a suspected case of food poisoning and admitted to the Negombo General Hospital.
They are said to have fallen ill after drinking the tea that was served to them at the institution on Sunday evening.
Police media spokesman Ajith Rohana said the preliminary investigations had revealed that particles ofurea fertilizer had been found in the tea.
He said a bag containing tea and sugar had been placed near some bags of urea fertilizer which were to be used in gardening and a student had by mistake handed over to the kitchen staff a bag of urea instead of the bag of sugar.
Negombo Hospital authorities said the students were out of danger. (SD)

Former president should be brought to book - Ranawaka
	
	Former president Mahinda Rajapaksa should be brought to book as he is the prime suspect in all cases of large scale corruption, said Power and Energy Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka this evening.
	Speaking at a seminar organised by the Anti-Corruption Front at the Sri Lanka Foundation Institute, Mr. Ranawaka said the present regime should be firm in dealing with those who face corruption charges and penalise everyone who had been involved in fraud and corruption in the recent past -- right from the top to the bottom.
	?We cannot afford to be lethargic about overcoming corruption,? he said; stressing that the racketeers who were involved in large scale corruption and fraud were trying to find a way out.
	He said some of them may try to bribe prominent members of the present regime in order to escape.
	Referring to the arrest of former UNP general secretary Tissa Attanayake, he said others involved in the campaign accusing Maithripala Sirisena and Ranil Wickremesinghe of having a secret pact should also be arrested.
	He said the present regime faced the challenge of making the infrastructural facilities constructed by the previous government economically viable. As an example he said the highways should be used to transport fuel. (Yohan Perera)

Musthapha who was a member of the Rajapaksa government, later crossed over to support President Maithripala Sirisena and was the only Muslim SLFPer to do so.
Sources close to the Minister further said that the post of state minister did not entail comprehensive responsibilities and that Musthapha was disillusioned by many factors including that he had to report to a cabinet Minister in charge of the same subjects.?(Hafeel Farisz)

Immigration seek police help to arrest Gunaratnam
	
	The Department of Immigration and Emigration has sought the assistance of state intelligence services to locate Frontline Socialist Party (FSP) Central Committee Member Kumar Gunaratnam whose visa had expired ten days ago.
	Immigration sources said Gunaratnam arrived in Sri Lanka on January 1 on a 30-day tourist visa which expired on January 31 and since then he is said to be in hiding.
	Gunaratnam, a citizen of Australia, was summoned twice by the Department of Immigration to record statements about his involvement in local politics.
	Sources said the department had confiscated his passport and asked him to return before January 31, to be sent back to Australia but he did not show up and his whereabouts are not known.
	On Tuesday the department wrote to Police Chief N.K. Illangakoon requesting that Mr. Gunaratnam be arrested on sight. A special report was submitted to the Ministry of Public Order with regard to the progress of the inquiry.
	Meanwhile, FSP Political Affairs Committee Member Pubudu Jayagoda they had not received any official warning from the police about the arrest of their Leader Kumar Gunaratnam. ?

## Title: 'India must be on guard against Tamil separatists'

'India must be on guard against Tamil separatists'
	
	Gotabaya Rajapaksa, former defence secretary of Sri Lanka, former army officer and former Sri Lankan president Mahinda Rajapaksa's brother, was largely seen as the driving force behind Sri Lanka's Eelam War IV that decimated the Tamil Tigers and ended an intense, quarter century long civil war in the island nation in 2009.
	Considered a hardliner in the recently ousted Mahinda Rajapaksa government in Sri Lanka, Gotabaya Rajapaksa has been accused variously of war crimes, of militarising the Sri Lankan society, of driving Colombo into Chinese arms and much more in the nearly nine years that he headed Sri Lanka's defence ministry.
	Gotabaya Rajapaksa, who lived in the US before returning to Sri Lanka in 2005 to help his brother fight the LTTE, has been under intense pressure from the new Sri Lankan government that is probing various acts of omission and commission allegedly committed by the previous regime.
	Exactly a month after the Rajapaksas lost power in Sri Lanka, Gotabaya agreed to his first detailed interview with long-time Rediff.com contributor Nitin A Gokhale through e-mail.
	Although one short interview is not enough to understand the man and his action -- "I have to be careful these days," he says -- here's a short glimpse into his thought process and actions.
	You handled the country's security apparatus for a long time. How do you react to the charge that your government has left the country more militarised? That you created a military disproportionate to Sri Lanka's size?
	We did not leave the country 'militarised.' as you say. Quite the contrary would be true in fact.
	The Sri Lankan military establishment was expanded during the war to the extent that was necessary to win the war against terrorism.
	You have to remember that the terrorists that we were up against in Sri Lanka were categorised even by the FBI as the world's deadliest terrorist organisation.
	Defeating such an organisation was no easy task. It took an integrated land, sea and air offensive to defeat the LTTE.
	One of the key requirements was to have enough manpower to hold the territory that the ground forces wrest from the control of the terrorists. We expanded the military for that purpose. But after the war there was no more expansion.
	Furthermore, after the war, we did not allow any of the anti-LTTE armed groups in the north and east to carry weapons any more.
	If we wanted to, we could have allowed the anti-LTTE and anti-TNA groups in the north and east to continue to carry weapons on the excuse that there were over 11,000 rehabilitated ex-LTTE cadres around, and therefore weapons were necessary to ensure the protection of the anti-LTTE groups.
	If these groups had continued to bear arms the whole voting pattern in the north and east would be different. It was we who brought freedom from armed conflict and terror to the north and east as well as the rest of the country.
	Today people are free to vote for whoever they like because of the achievements of our government.Have you left the country polarised?
	I don't think so. We were in government, so people opposed us and politically motivated people don't usually say good things about their political opponents. Some say that we left the country polarised.
	There was no question about the fact that we had to take on the LTTE. But that was not a war against the Tamil people.
	It was we who liberated the Tamil people from the LTTE.When the Tigers were around where the Tamil people ever able to vote freely at elections?
	At the presidential elections held in 2010, the Tamil people of the north and east have voted in large numbers for the army commander who served in our government during the war.
	At the 2015 presidential elections, the Tamil people of the north and east once again voted for the cabinet minister who held the position of acting minister of defence when the president went overseas during the war.
	That should be sufficient proof that we did not leave the country polarised.Your critics allege that President Mahinda and you ran Sri Lanka like a dictatorship with midnight raids, surveillance and intimidation of opposition being a common occurrence. How do you respond to these accusations?
	Sri Lanka was never a dictatorship.
	We are a democracy and under the government that I served in, we held the most free and fair elections ever held in this country.
	After 2005 when our government was first elected to power there were elections almost every year. All those elections were free and fair.
	We lost the 2015 presidential election because the election was free and fair.
	As for these midnight raids, there may have been night time searches during the war, but never after that. This talk of surveillance and phone tapping is a figment of some people's imagination.
	During the tenure of my government, none of the Opposition parties were harassed or persecuted in any manner.
	On the contrary, the president had cordial relations with politicians of all Opposition parties. The lines of communication were always open which is why so many members of the Opposition joined our party at various times.
	Even a vociferous critic of our government like Mangala Samaraweera was on the verge of joining our government. That was possible because there was never any enmity between our government and members of the Opposition.Nearly six years after Eelam War 4 got over, looking back would you have done anything differently?
	No.As defence secretary you took a decision to source most of your military hardware from China over the past decade. Was it a conscious move or was your hand forced by India's reluctance to help you?
	All Sri Lankan governments since the war began in the 1980s sourced most of their arms and ammunition from China. That continued under our government as well.
	When the final phase of the war began in 2006 under our government, India was unable to sell us arms because of pressure from Tamil Nadu.
	If it was possible to buy weapons from India, we would certainly have done so. I explained the situation to Vijay Singh, my counterpart, in New Delhi at that time.
	He too agreed that given the situation that Sri Lanka finds itself in, she has no option but to buy arms supplies from whoever is willing to supply them.There was a period between 2006 and 2008 when you had an excellent rapport with the Indian establishment, but somewhere closer to the end of the war, the relationship seemed to have deteriorated?What really went wrong? If you can elaborate a bit?
	I would say that the relationship with India remained on a very good footing until the war ended and even beyond.
	In the last few years, however, India may have misunderstood Sri Lanka's relationship with China.
	We have always had excellent relations with China. In the last few years, a number of projects were initiated with concessionary loans from China.
	I think Indian policymakers misread this as a sign of Sri Lanka drifting into the Chinese orbit.How important was India's help in your fight against LTTE?
	India's understanding of the issues faced by Sri Lanka during the war was crucial.
	On a mutual agreement we formed groups of key officials on both sides called 'troikas' with the external affairs secretary, defence secretary and national security advisor on the Indian side and myself as the defence secretary, Lalith Weeratunga, the secretary to the president, and my brother Basil Rajapaksa as the advisor to the president on the Sri Lankan side.
	The members of these troikas could phone one another at any time of the day or night and Basil kept the Indian side informed about everything that was happening at the ground level in Sri Lanka.
	India was also aware of the threat that the LTTE posed to India as well. So this understanding helped.Were you disappointed with India's stand at the UNHCR?
	I feel that India should have stood by Sri Lanka in the UNHRC given the fact that she had a policy of not supporting country specific resolutions in the UNHRC.
	But given the pressure that Tamil Nadu was able to exert on the Indian central government at that time, I understand that India did not have much of a choice.How important is India's support and friendship for Sri Lanka?
	India's friendship and support is very important to Sri Lanka. It is a matter of regret that India appears to have thought otherwise.
	There have been tensions between India and China for many decades, but Sri Lanka has traditionally had close relations with both nations.
	Sri Lanka's relationship with China has always been of an economic nature.
	The docking of Chinese submarines in the Colombo harbour was only for re-supplying and not for any military purpose.
	Do you fear retribution by the new regime in Sri Lanka or even a witch hunt by Western nations now that you are no longer in power?
	I do not fear any retribution from any quarter or Western witch hunts. We knew the risks involved when we took on the LTTE despite resistance from interested nations.
	We fought terrorism to a finish because that was our duty by our nation.
	The people of Sri Lanka still appreciate the sacrifices we made and the risks we took.
	Getting voted into office or voted out of office is a different matter. Churchill too was voted out of office soon after he won World War II, but that did not mean that the British public did not appreciate the leadership he had provided during the war.Is there a possibility that LTTE rump or sympathisers of Tamil Eelam may try and make a comeback in Sri Lanka?
	When we were in power, we were always vigilant about such a possibility. That vigilance has to continue.
	India too should be on her guard against any attempt by Tamil separatist forces to set up a base in Tamil Nadu.
	Tamil separatist ideology came to Sri Lanka through Tamil Nadu and Tamil separatism has a much longer history in India than it does in Sri Lanka.
	India made a bad mistake by encouraging Tamil terrorist groups in the 1980s. India should be careful about sending the wrong signals to the wrong people once again.The interview with former Defence Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa was done by Indian journalist Nitin Gokhale

## Title: Indian trawlers back in SL waters

Indian trawlers back in SL waters
	
	More Indian trawlers have been allegedly fishing near the northern coastline of Sri Lanka over the past two weeks, Jaffna-based fisher leaders say, the Hindu newspaper reported.
	The fishermen from both sides got into a tussle at sea recently, after the nets of those from the northern region of the island nation were damaged. ?There was a major problem in Vadamarachchi a couple of days ago when our nets had been damaged by the Indian trawlers,? said Josephpillai Sinthathurai, a fisherman based in Madagal in northern Jaffna.
	?Earlier, the Sri Lankan Navy took action promptly, but now they seem reluctant to arrest Indian fishermen who are poaching,? he said. When contacted, Navy spokesperson Kosala Warnakulasooriya said: ?We received no such complaint from the fishermen.?
	In the past few days, northern fishermen suffered damages ranging from Sri Lankan rupees 75,000 to 1 lakh, Mr. Sinthathurai said. ?Most of us have already borrowed heavily to make ends meet. With the unceasing problem of Indian trawlers poaching in our waters, our livelihoods have been badly hit,? he said.
	The fisherfolk are helpless as the Navy is silent, says Nataraja Rathnaraja, a fisher cooperative leader in Mayilitythurai in the Jaffna peninsula.
	Fishermen attributed the Navy?s ?inaction? to the high-level bilateral visits coming up in the two countries. Sri Lankan President Maithripala Sirisena is scheduled to visit India from February 15 to 17, while Prime Minister Narendra Modi is likely to visit Sri Lanka in mid-March.
	The Sri Lankan side is also working on releasing the 87 Indian trawlers in its custody. The trawlers are expected to be released in the coming week, ahead of the President?s visit.Officials in decision-making circles in Colombo told The Hindu, on condition of anonymity, that they would be lenient on Indian fishermen found poaching, considering the upcoming high-level visits aimed at improving relations between India and Sri Lanka.
	No official complaint about Indian trawlers fishing in Sri Lankan waters has so far been made to the Indian High Commission in Colombo.
	?It is total destruction. The last few weeks have been a disaster for our fishermen,? said K. Rajachandran, secretary, Jaffna District Fisheries Federation.
	?Unlike before, Indian trawlers now come and fish in our waters without any issue. Our fishermen are dejected,? he said.
	While Indo-Lanka relations are rapidly improving with high level state visits, the Palk Bay fishing conflict is taking a nasty turn, according to Jaffna-based researcher Ahilan Kadirgamar. ?The optimism that came with the change of Government here and now better relations between the two countries can only be sustained among the fishing communities if talks towards a solution are announced soon,? he said.
	The Palk Bay conflict has proved a major strain on Indo-Lanka relations over the last few years. Nearly 700 Indian fishermen were arrested in 2014 on charges of poaching.

MR in the ring against RW?
	
Four United People Freedom Alliance (UPFA) allies today spoke in favour of fielding former President Mahinda Rajapaksa as the prime ministerial candidate at the forthcoming general election so as to ensure its victory.
They said there was no other hope of defeating incumbent Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and that Mr. Rajapaksa had secured 5.8 million votes at the January presidential election.
?This is not a battle against President Maithripala Sirisena but a move against Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, who was appointed outside constitutional procedures,? Democratic Left Front (DLF) Leader Vasudeva Nanayakkara told a news conference held in Colombo.
The others who spoke in favour of such a move were Mahajana Eksath Peramuna (MEP) Leader Dinesh Gunawardena, National Freedom Front (NFF) Leader Wimal Weerawansa and Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) Leader Udaya Gammanpila.
Mr. Nananyakkara said they were against the national unity government concept and were keen to set up a UPFA government to make the country self-sufficient. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

MR rejects allegations
	
Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa today rejected the statements made about him by the present government and said these statements were ?false? and ?misleading?.
?At a recent TV interview, it was said that over Rs. 100,000 million had been allocated to the Presidential Secretariat for the year 2015 and that it had now been reduced to Rs. 2,720 million. A sum of 100,000 million was never allocated to the Presidential Secretariat. The actual sum allocated for 2015 was Rs. 9,593 million (Koti 959),? the statement said.
It further said that no less than 25 state institutions such as the National Salaries and Cadres Commission, the National Ocean Affairs Committee etc, were listed under the vote of the President.
?Former presidents and their widows are also maintained by the Presidential Secretariat under this vote. The Establishments and Organizations Division of the Presidential Secretariat serves all the above mentioned institutions and absorbs the bulk of the expenditure. This expenditure therefore represents a large number of institutions and not only expenditure allocated to the President,? it said.
The actual sum allocated to the Office of the President (which is only one component of the vote that is designated under the President) for 2015 was Rs. 3754 million. This included Rs. 1,000 million which was meant to be spent on the construction of various community projects around the country. If this item is removed, the expenditure on the President?s Office is reduced to the Rs. 2,750 million that is said to be the new allocation for the president.
?It was also said that a special plane for my exclusive use was to be bought with taxpayers? money at a cost of 16 million USD. No plane was ever ordered for my use. When Sri Lankan Airlines ordered new aircraft, Airbus Industries had provided a complimentary VIP conversion kit to install a cubicle with special facilities for special customers on commercial flights which can be installed and dismantled as required. The sum of 15 million USD was only the manufacturer?s indicative value of this kit which is actually provided free,? Mr. Rajapaksa said in the statement.
The various presidential residences are being mentioned in such a manner as to convey the impression that I had built them for my use. Temple Trees, President?s House and the residences in Nuwara Eliya and Kandy have been used by heads of State and government since the colonial era. The presidential residences in Anuradhapura, Embilipitiya, Mahiyangana and Kataragama were built by President Premadasa.
?None of these properties were built during my tenure. It was reported in one newspaper that Temple Trees and President?s House will be opened for public viewing soon. I welcome that because tens of thousands of schoolchildren from rural and remote areas and adults toured Temple Trees even when I said that 22 Defender Jeeps had been ?discovered? in Borella and another 53 vehicles belonging to the Presidential Secretariat found ?abandoned? in Pitakotte.
These are official vehicle yards of the Presidential Secretariat and to say that vehicles were ?discovered? at such places is absurd. The vehicles found in Pitakotte are mostly high security vehicles dating from the 1980s which were condemned but cannot be auctioned off as per the normal procedure. All vehicles used by me and my staff have been returned.
The details of other vehicles that had been issued to various officers and institutions under the Presidential Secretariat should be known to the Establishments and Organizations Division and can easily be traced by perusing the register maintained for the purpose,? the former president said.

Only President can dissolve Parliament ? John Seneviratne
	
	Chief Opposition Whip John Seneviratne said only the executive president had the power to dissolve parliament, and therefore Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe?s threat was meaningless.
	Mr. Wickremesinghe had said at a function at UNP headquarters Sirikotha that parliament would be dissolved if a no confidence motion against Public Security Minister John Amaratunga was carried.
	Responding to these remarks, Mr. Seneviratne said the prime minister had no authority to dissolve Parliament in such an event.
	?Only the executive president can do it,? he said.
	Asked whether President Maitripala Sirisena as chairman of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) was consulted before bringing this motion, Mr. Seneviratne said it was a decision of the SLFP parliamentary group and had nothing to do with the executive president.
	?We collected the signatures of 114 MPs for this motion. There are also a few of our members currently abroad. With their support, we can easily carry this motion,? he said.(Kelum Bandara)

	Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said yesterday that Parliament would be dissolved straightaway if the government failed to defeat the no-confidence motion against Public Order, Disaster Management and Christian Affairs Minister John Amaratunga.
	He made this remark while addressing the Working Committee of the United National Party (UNP) held at the party headquarters, Sirikotha.
	The Prime Minister has also decided to hold the debate on the no-faith motion against the Minister within this week. Accordingly, he is to request the Speaker today to fix a date for the debate within this week, government sources said.? ?
	The sources also said that Mr. Wickremesinghe would request Speaker Chamal Rajapaksa to allocate any number of days requested by the opposition for the debate.
	The no-confidence motion signed by 114 MPs mainly from the SLFP was handed over to Secretary General of the Parliament on Friday. It is said to have contained allegations of obstructing the duties of Wattala Pradeshiya Sabha Chairman and matters relating to the alleged assaults on the supporters of the SLFP and political vengeance by ruling party supporters.
	Earlier the government had announced that Parliament would be dissolved after offering maximum possible relief to the people and strengthening the democratic institutions that is essential for good governance under the 100- day programme of the new government of President Maithripala Sirisena.
	However, UNP sources said the next Parliamentary election would be held on April 4 if Parliament is dissolved this week.

	The Commissioner said people used to bring illegal things using cardamom, chili pepper and using false bottom in food containers.
