A hue and cry over an unpardonable crime
	

A large number of peasants in Uva had the ownership of their holdings regularized when they received title deeds from Number One in yahapalanaya at a grand ceremony held recently. 

However, the extravagant spending on the ceremony by the organizers had raised the eye brows of Number One as well as other VIPs who attended the ceremony.
It had come to light that the big council looking after the province had spent nearly Rs.10 million on the event.
The Red members of the provincial council have already decided to raise this matter at the next sittings of the council. They say that incurring such a massive expenditure on an event like this in a country where the government has to print paper money to pay the salaries of its public servants is an unpardonable crime.

A private visit that went public
	

There is a monk who played an active role in several popular movements responsible for bringing about a series of far reaching political developments in the recent past.

This monk who had been closely associated with several political parties from time to time has of late embarked on a new mission after severing his latest political ties. The excuse he often proffers for this conduct is that he has always been above petty and narrow sectarian politics.
The monk had quite recently visited a sibling of a highly influential political family in Pulatisipura seeking a big favour from him. The sibling who had given a right royal welcome to the monk had not only complied with his request, but had offered an unforgettable gift as well to him.
A politico from Pulatisipura equipped with a fine-tuned political antenna had obtained within minutes the full details of the encounter between the monk and the sibling (with the VIP status now thrust on him) and spread the news far and wide soon afterwards, they say.

Be warned, you may be eating poisoned rice!
	
Chief Medical Officer of the Polonnaruwa Kidney Disease Prevention Unit Dr. Malin Methsuriya said that rice mill owners used highly poisonous chemicals to preserve rice they hold in stock and that such treated rice could be preserved for at least five years.
He made this comment at a meeting of the District Agricultural Committee warning that people who consumed rice treated with that toxic chemical were susceptible to terminal kidney diseases.
The District Agricultural Committee met under the chairmanship of Polonnaruwa Government Agent Ranjith Ariyaratne. Commenting on the progress of renal disease prevention programmes in the district Dr. Methsuriya said it is expected that at least 100 new kidney patients would be reported every month. He also said that about 10 per cent of schoolchildren had developed symptoms of kidney ailments.
 We carried out urine tests to find albumin in their urine which was a clear indication that that they were susceptible to kidney ailments. Still, the cause of kidney ailments has not been identified, but it is believed that the use of aggro-chemicals is a major cause.
In this scenario the use of highly poisonous chemicals in preserving food items is a serious matter and steps should be taken to arrest and correct this situation, Dr. Methsuriya said. (K.G.Karunaratne)

Benign prostatic hyperplasia
	
Throughout the course of human history, the mortality of the human race has declined owing to advancements of medicine and technology. As a result of this increased life expectancy, modern civilization has seen a considerable increase in the ageing population. Ageing is a process of physical, psychological and social transformation where a person is physiologically unable to meet the demands of the environment over time, basically writing cheques the body cannot cash. Over the course of a persons lifetime, various health care interventions and medical tweakings are conducted to make the arduous process of ageing as graceful as possible. The elderly face a gradual loss of senses, impaired memory and non-communicable diseases such as high blood pressure, diabetes, heart disease and malignancies, all of which are well-known conditions for which people seek medical help. However there are other health issues that are usually overlooked. Prostatism or Benign Prostate Hyperplasia (BPH) is a very common condition that occurs in old age that may be agonizing but which people are ignorant about. The peak incidence are in men above the age of 40 but symptoms usually appear between the ages of 50-70 years. 
The human excretory system is responsible for ridding the body of waste products and toxins. The kidney acts as the principle organ of the excretory system that filters the blood, constantly clearing unwanted waste materials that are either ingested or produced in the body, thus producing urine. In addition, the kidneys aid in the regulation of the volume and composition of fluids and virtually keeping all the electrolytes in the body at optimal concentrations. The waste products include urea, creatinine and other metabolites resulting from breakdown of various compounds in the body. 

The excretory system comprises of a pair of kidneys, two ureters, a bladder and urethra. The urine is propelled through each ureter of the respective kidney which finally fill up the bladder. The bladder serves as a muscular reservoir for urine that has the ability to stretch when it is being filled.
Specialized receptors (sensors) are located in the bladder wall that are sensitive to stretch. The bladder is progressively filled with urine, building up a tension within its walls. When the tension exceeds a certain threshold, the receptors alert the nervous system via the nerves that innervate the bladder. This alert triggers a reflex mediated by the nervous system that signals the bladder and its sphincter, thus eliciting natures call. Although this is a reflex, our brain has voluntary control over the urge to urinate. Once the urination is initiated, the bladder musculature contracts, thereupon propelling urine through the bladder neck that funnels into the urethra. The male and female excretory systems are identical with the exception of the urethra, as the male urethra serves as a common tube for the passage of urine to the exterior and semen during ejaculation serving a dual functionality of excretory and reproductive systems. The male urethra is longer than that of the female, with 4 distinctive parts extending from the bladder neck to the tip of glans penis (external urethral meatus) namely the prostatic, membranous, bulbar and penile urethra. 
The prostate is a muscular gland that serves as part of the male reproductive system. It encircles the bladder neck and the proximal part of the urethra, hence the name prostatic urethra. It is a wedge shaped gland approximately 20g in weight and 3cm in length. The prostate is responsible for secreting 30% of the fluid in semen that is slightly alkaline in nature that protects and nourishes the sperm. The growth of the prostate gland is under hormonal control by testicular androgens (male sex hormones). Testosterone is the principle testicular androgen that controls the growth and survival of prostatic cells. The prostate possesses an enzyme (5-alpha reductase) that converts testosterone into dihydrotestosterone (DHT), a more potent form. 
In benign prostatic hyperplasia, due to an unclear cause, DHT increases prostatic cellular growth and inhibits cell death that leads to accumulations of senescent prostatic cells causing the gland to enlarge, a natural phenomenon of ageing in a majority of men.It is important to know that it is not malignant (cancer) or a premalignant lesion (giving rise to cancer) although an enlarged prostate provokes suspicion of prostatic cancer. 

Symptoms 
In BPH, the enlarged gland compresses the urethra, hence obscuring the urinary flow through that kindles symptoms of this condition. (It gives rise to a spectrum of symptoms that stems from increased size of the prostate and prostatic contractions). A spectrum of symptoms arise depending on the degree of obstruction ranging from no symptoms to lower urinary tract symptoms, bladder outflow obstruction to urinary retention giving rise to various complications. The obstruction to urinary flow through the urethra causes the following lower urinary tract symptoms or LUTS. 

Hesitancy (Difficulty to initiate urination that is not relieved by straining) 
	Poor stream 
	Intermittent flow of urine 
	Dribbling (appearance of few drops continuously following the cessation of the main stream) 
	Incomplete evacuation of the bladder that causes retention of urine within the bladder triggering the stretch receptors of the bladder with a smaller volume of additional urine, causing, 
	increased frequency of urination including at night 
	Urgency (Urgent need to pass urine once the desire arises) 
Due to the increased workload resulting from the resistance to urinary flow, the bladder increases in muscle mass and distends further, precipitating the retention of urine within the bladder. With chronic retention, the residual urine serves as a reservoir for infection and formation of stones. Recurrent urinary tract infections are usually a wake-up call. 

Blood in urine (due to rupture of blood vessels) 
Complications are urinary retention, recurrent urinary tract infections, urinary stones and kidney failure in the extreme cases. Acute retention presents an emergency with severe pain that is a mere exaggeration of the normal desire to urinate and requires urgent catheterization to alleviate symptoms. 

Diagnosis 
A thorough history and examination helps the clinician arrive at a probable diagnosis. Abdominal examination may reveal a distended bladder with chronic retention. Features of anaemia and dehydration may be present with chronic kidney impairment. The external urethral meatus and the testicles are examined to exclude other causes. A digital rectal examination assists in suspicion of prostatic cancer. Neurological examination excludes lesions in the nervous system with diabetes, Parkinsons disease and other neurological lesionsthat may have given rise to the retention of urine. 

Investigations 
Imaging methods such as abdominal, pelvis and trans-rectal (through the rectum) ultrasound scan to detect prostate enlargement, residual urine volume in the bladder, and assess complications such as hydronephrosis (swollen kidneys) and bladder trabeculae (pouches formed in the bladder wall). If prostatectomy surgery is decided, a cystourethroscopy is done to inspect the urethra to determine the route of surgery (Whether through the urethra or open surgery) 
In addition, lowered haemoglobin content in full blood count, high serum creatinine levels and abnormal serum electrolyte concentrations arise suspicion of renal impairment. A full urine report and culture is used in the case of infection while prostate antigen testing and biopsy is performed when there is suspected prostate cancer. Uro-flowmetry is not routinely performed in Sri Lanka. 

Management 
The management strategies depend upon the severity of symptoms and the presentation. Some BPH dont always require treatment but it is recommended to arrange regular appointments with your doctor to monitor your symptoms and the size of your prostate. Conservative measures, medical and surgical therapy is currently available as treatment of BPH. Conservative management is followed in men with mild symptoms, fair urine flow rate and satisfactory bladder emptying as well as in men who arent fit for surgery due to age or other medical problems. 
These measures include, 
urination without postponing once the urge arises 
	be careful with drugs such as anti-muscarinics as they may precipitate the symptoms 
	Limit fluid intake 
	limit alcohol and caffeine ingestion 
It is important to adhere to the prescription of a medical professional, as the treatment for each patient is tailored to fit his symptoms (graded by IPSS score and uro-flowmetry) and physical state. These medical therapies include alpha-1 adrenergic blockers that ease the urinary flow by inhibiting the contraction of the muscle fibres of the prostate and 5-alpha reductase inhibitors that decreases the size of the prostate and is mandatory to check response to treatment. Surgery is indicated in patients with severe symptoms, episodes of acute and chronic retention, renal impairment, complications and those who do not respond to medical therapy. The surgical methods available are TURP (Transurethral resection of the prostate) and open surgery. 
It is important to discuss the outcomes and complications of prostatectomy with the surgeon before complying with the treatment. The bottom line is to age gracefully and get yourself checked for even the lesser-known overlooked demons like BPH.

Biking The key to freedom
	
Most people dont like bikers or motorcyclists or any two wheel riders. They consider these riders to be irresponsible daredevils who go about throwing themselves in front of cars and just asking to be knocked over. 
When interviewed, a number of drivers used polite but mainly colourful language to describe the riders they had seen or been in accidents with. 
Those idiots should be more careful, growled one such driver, They just go flinging themselves in front of cars and then expect us to take the blame when we hit them! 
Another said that bikers should be banned or have a law passed on them as they have a bad influence on the community.
All in all, - Bikers are bad - was the main message from all drivers interviewed. 


However, have you ever heard the point of view of bikers themselves 
It makes me feel alive! said one rather zealous rider. Theres no other way to get so exhilarated and feel that pure rush of adrenaline. 
Motorcycles are considered dangerous machines. Its a fact and anyone who says otherwise does not know them. However, in contrast to what many mothers believe to be two wheeled death machines, in most bike and car related accident cases, bikers often claim that the drivers were distracted with cell phones or may have been driving too fast or were not alert to their surroundings. In addition, an independent inquiry proved that 80% of accidents involving bikers were caused by other road users, most of which were due to car drivers specifically failing to look properly. 
But what many riders believe that motorcycles represent overrides everything else: Freedom. 
Riding a motorcycle is a feeling that cannot be explained in words, stated a former biker. That wind in your face, exhaust noise and that numb hand when you throttle and brake: all gives a biker the maximum feeling which cannot be obtained by any other activity. 

	They consider these riders to be irresponsible daredevils
	
	
	We ride because we want to, because it gives us that feeling of just being who we want to be. Were free, very free. No esponsibilities or worries or stress. Just us, the bike and the road,
	
We ride because we want to, because it gives us that feeling of just being who we want to be. Were free, very free. No responsibilities or worries or stress. Just us, the bike and the road, declared a young rider in a voice filled with passion. 
Many of the former riders in Sri Lanka say the reason they were forced to convert to cars was because we dont have the privilege to ride high capacity bikes and the reason that the government believes, that those bikes can be used to rob banks. In fact, one biker asked why Sri Lanka allows Ferraris and Lamborghinis into the country while high-powered motorcycles are banned except for the police and the armed forces. Isnt it unfair to undermine one side and help the other was his only comment. 


Furthermore, many riders point out that the law regulators seem to have forgotten or have no idea about safety. The ban of full face helmets (which is a vital piece of safety equipment for a riders head, face and neck areas) was issued in response to banks claiming that bank robbers wore these to hide their identities. The angry motorcycle community maintains that the banning of important safety equipment would not compensate for the sheer lack of alertness by bank security. 
Overall, the motorcycle community stated that Sri Lanka should update or amend her Motor traffic laws which would enable both bikers and drivers to enjoy their privileges and moreover would help not only fuel good culture among drivers and riders but would also help future generations as well. Riders have been discriminated against for far too long and the result is a negative image that much of the motorcycle community dont like at all. 
In response to the question Why do you ride the riders, unanimously state. 
We love riding because its the key to Freedom.

China will fight back Indias attempts to sour S.Asia ties: State media
	

China will retaliate if India continues to be uneasy with Beijings increasing influence in south Asia and attempts to meddle in its diplomatic relations with countries like Nepal and Sri Lanka, Chinese state media warned on Tuesday. 
Indicating that Indias failure to match Chinas growing defence and diplomatic clout, the state media article said New Delhi is always unnerved to see exchanges between Beijing and south Asian countries. 
China hopes India can understand the pursuit of China and regional countries for common development, and be part of it. However, New Delhi doesnt share this thinking, instead seeking to balance China, the article said. 
If such tendencies in India continue, China will have to fight back, because its core interests will have been violated. This is not what we hope for, but the ball is in Indias court, the nationalistic tabloid Global Times said in a report. 
It quoted a Hindustan Times report to suggest that the latest reason for India to be unnerved is the visit of defence minister Chang Wanquan to Sri Lanka and Nepal, which began Sunday.

The tone of a report in the Hindustan Times sounds vigilant and sour. Claiming that Changs visit to Nepal and the first ever China-Nepal joint military drill has made New Delhi nervous, the newspaper also noted that the Nepalese government cannot afford to say no to Beijing as if China is carrying a stick around when interacting with its neighbours, the Global Times said.

Comeys  testimony humiliates Trump
	

By Jennifer Rubin 
(c) 2017, The Washington Post   
Before FBI Director James Comey began his testimony before the House Intelligence Committee, President Donald Trump was back, compulsively tweeting - and underscoring the growing perception that his allegation that President Barack Obama had Trumps wires tapped is nonsensical, his attachment to reality fleeting and his concern about Russian interference in the election on his behalf is palpable. 
He tweeted: James Clapper and others stated that there is no evidence Potus colluded with Russia. This story is FAKE NEWS and everyone knows it! (Interestingly, he limited the denial of collusion to him, POTUS, only.) Certainly, he had been rattled by a parade of Republican lawmakers affirming there was no evidence of wiretapping. He was right to be anxious. 
Comey did in fact confirm that the FBI is currently investigating Russian interference with our elections, including any links with members of the Trump campaign, and whether the latter constituted any crimes. A short time later, Comey lowered the boom. What about evidence of wiretapping, as Trump claimed in tweets Comey was succinct: I have no information that supports those tweets. 
That testimony is not fake. Trump cannot change the fact that his own national intelligence team is attempting to determine whether a foreign power tried to manipulate our election. Try as he might, there is no way for Trump to discount or conceal that reality. The stone-faced Comey crisply providing definitive, unemotional testimony that was compelling, as was that of National Security Agency chief Michael Rogers, who, with furrowed brow, often answered with a simple yes or no. 
Comeys statement was not surprising, but it was nevertheless devastating. To hear the head of the FBI in essence call the president a liar or wide-eyed conspiratorialist is bracing, if not humiliating, for the chief executive. And reflecting on the morning tweet, Trump now seems desperate, childish and vulnerable. Hes been tripped up by his own grandiose lies. At some level he must know it. 
Perhaps now Republicans can stop treating the presidents outbursts seriously. They need to call them what they are: Wild lies and accusations designed to distract from the very real investigation into Russian attempts to throw the election his way. 
In just a few brief lines, Comey eviscerated whatever credibility Trump still had. Whether the intelligence agency will find evidence of collusion remains to be seen. But what we do know is that Trump will not be able to lie his way through this nor distract the public. 
Rep. Will Hurd, R-Texas, who appeared Sunday on ABCs This Week, made an interesting observation. Its going to go down in the history of Mother Russia as the greatest covert action campaign, not because President Trump won, he said. There was no manipulation of the vote-tallying machines. Its going to go down as the greatest covert action because it drove a -- created a wedge, whether real or perceived, between the White House, the intelligence community, and the American public. 
Well, it will also go down as the greatest covert action in history because Russia sought to manipulate the outcome of our election and provided assistance to the Trump campaign. Moreover, Vladimir Putin has convinced a significant chunk of the American electorate that Trump is illegitimate. (One poll shows 57 percent of young voters between 18 and 30 consider him illegitimate.) And worse, its convinced many Americans that our presidents word cannot be trusted.

Common gene explains why peoples brains age faster
	
A common gene variant has been discovered in about one-third of the population that may explain why some peoples brains age faster than others, US researchers said this week. The gene, known as TMEM106B, accelerates normal brain ageing in older people by up to 12 years, said the report in the journal Cell Systems. 
The gene generally starts to affect people around 65, particularly in the frontal cortex, which is responsible for higher mental processes like concentration, planning, judgment and creativity. 
Until age 65, everybodys in the same boat, and then theres some yet-to-be-defined stress that kicks in, said Abeliovich.  If you have two good copies of the gene, you respond well to that stress. If you have two bad copies, your brain ages quickly. 
Other individual genes have been previously found which raise the risk of neurodegenerative disorders, such as apolipoprotein E (APOE) for Alzheimers disease. 
If you look at a group of seniors, some will look older than their peers and some will look younger, said co-author Asa Abeliovich, professor of pathology and neurology in the Taub Institute for Alzheimers Disease and the Ageing Brain at Columbia University Medical Centre. 
People who have two bad copies of this gene have a frontal cortex that, by various biological measures, appears 12 years older that those who have two normal copies. 
Researchers found the gene by analysing genetic data from autopsied human brain samples taken from 1,904 people without any apparent disease.

Crescent Global supports govt.s national insurance programme
	

Crescent Globals top-rated reinsurance covers and support are what could only be termed a miraculous blessing bestowed on the country for the maiden national insurance schemes rolled out by the government recently, including a first of its kind in the world, the national natural disaster insurance scheme (NNDIS) for all uninsured Sri Lankans.
The NNDIS initial estimated claim of up to Rs.5.4 billion for the flood and disaster in May last year is being settled, in particular in Kegalle, which was the worst affected district, where all claims were settled in full earlier this year.
Crescent Global South Asia has the most diverse and the most spectacular reinsurance portfolio in the country in terms of national insured schemes launched, insured properties and reinsured projects. A quick glance would make this fact abundantly clear.
Examples are the cooperative insurance policy for the fisherman, NITF national natural disaster cover for up to Rs.10 billion, SRCC and terrorism cover top up cover up to Rs.10 billion, combined retrocession cessation XOL cover for 30 percent compulsory ceding of for all general insurance and Ceylon Petroleum Corporation, by far the largest specialized risk in Sri Lanka, as reinsured with A-rated securities in the international markets by Crescent Group.
The NITF has been in the forefront in launching the national schemes last year. The best example, Minister Niroshan Perera says is the proactive cover, the insurance provided to all uninsured for natural disasters including a cover for fishermen and more recently the scheme for paddy farmers.
The most recent is the islandwide insurance for natural disasters for agricultural farmers for Rs.25,000 per hectare, topped up by a national cover for natural calamities such as flood, inundation, drought and wild elephant attacks, which were all insurance initiatives reinsured in A-rated securities.
Crescent Globals single strength has been that organisations that have been reinsured through its good offices have helped entities such as NITF, Cooperative Insurance and Petroleum Corp be proactive about disasters or accidents and losses and not reactive.
Its also significant that what Crescent Global has insured is either on the mammoth scale -- the entire country, for natural disasters -- or of mammoth size, such as the biggest properties, of which Petroleum is obviously huge, in terms of the volatility of the commodity insured and the sheer enormity of the property value indemnified, said Crescent Global South Asia Director Indrajith Fernando.
But its not the mere proactivity but the range as well. Crescent Globals portfolio is marked by its diversity.
Take the national cooperative fisheries cover for instance. All fishermen registered under co-op fishermen society are covered for personal accident for Rs.1 million per person, including funeral expenses, with a hospitalization per day cover. Additionally, this is a 365-day, 24-hour cover, for onshore and offshore eventualities.
The NNDIS, a first of its kind in the world, applauded by Breton Woods institutes including the World Bank, also insures all fishermen, uninsured households, small and medium-size businesses and industries and all persons while fishing for personal accident, during natural disasters, with a cover of Rs.10 billion. It is a cover to beat all these covers, so to speak, adds Fernando. This cover includes an emergency relief fund for food and shelter, for up to
Rs.200 million.

faliing love with japan - again and again
	
Kanthi Gunathilake is an unusual writer. She has written 52 works of fiction, and most of them are based in Japan. She writes about Japan and the Japanese with a level of knowledge and understanding that can come only with a deep feeling for the country and its people. 
That she has lived in Japan for nearly two decades certainly helps, but her feeling and insights are not the result of a mere passage of time. Her books are not about expatriate (or gaijin) experiences in Japan. Her characters are Japanese and the writing unravels their actions and thoughts. 
After writing so much, she hasnt received much recognition. That she isnt known in Japan is understandable because her books are in Sinhala, and havent been translated into either English or Japanese. But there hasnt been much recognition at home, either. 
Much of her work falls into the youth romance genre. Of the five books reviewed, three  Kiyomi, Hima Bima Pamula and Noriko San  have young Japanese women as protagonists. They offer the requisite happy ending but are skillfully written. The author is quite good at producing dramatic tension through characterization. 


In the novel Noriko San, Noriko and Chiko are close friends. Chikos elder brother Ichiro is a pleasant young man who begins to court Noriko. But the reader is left wondering what kind of man he is when Noriko hears that he has ties to the Yakuza, Japans underworld. She maintains dramatic tension in her stories with the use of such simple but effective devices. 
Her writing reveals a close affinity with nature, and an obvious love of the countryside. Every book has detailed descriptions of Japans flowers and scenic beauty, along with rituals pertaining to Japans ancient and indigenous religions such as Shintoism, as well as with folk culture and festivals. While outsiders see Japan as a very industrialized and urbanized country, Kanthi Gunathilake takes the reader to a pastoral Japan where old world values and respect for the forces of nature still exist. 


Puduma Hithena Iskole (Amazing School) is a childrens story. It isnt actually about any school. Rather, its a heartwarming tale of friendship between two children. One is Yuki, a five-year-old girl whose mother was killed by a tsunami. Junkun, a six-year-old boy, is her friend. While exploring a childs inner world, Yuki is unable to understand what people mean by saying her mother had died  she only knows that her mother doesnt return home from wherever she is. But Juki learns what death could be like when Junkun disappears while trying to float on a toy raft in a river. 
Hima Bima Paamula is a tale of young love, but its a story about Japans illegal immigrants who live in permanent fear of deportation. Its brings together Yuri, a Brazilian girl of Japanese origin, and Mihran, a Bangladeshi student who stays behind as an illegal alien to earn some money, and helps Yuri through a difficult period of pregnancy as her Japanese lover disappears. 
Happy Beggar is different from these Japanese stories as it is about a Portuguese fisherman and his family. Benjamin is considered lazy by the entire village but strikes fortune when his wife persuades him to move to a town and start life again. There is tragedy as Benjamin kills someone impulsively. This book, too, has a happy ending but her style makes for effortless reading, though one wonders if some of the names of her characters, such as Vessie, Ruby, and Meryl are Portuguese. 
Her prose is easy to read and lucid. This is the opening passage from her novella The Red Kimono.



The new day filled Hitomi with joy as she watched the sun rising from the Pacific Ocean. The wonders of the universe were amazing. But it was an illusion beyond description, a beautiful illusion which appeared and disappeared every day. The entire mountain range of Fukuyama was covered with snow. The white snowscape kissed by rays falling from the direction of the Pacific was a wonder to behold. The snow shone silvery in the sunlight, making the mountains shine like a conjurors trick. 

Her writing reveals a close affinity with nature, and an obvious love of the countryside

The Red Kimono is based on a Japanese folk tradition. On Jan. 15, the sejinksi festival marks the ascendance of young Japanese from adolescence to adulthood as they turn 21, and earn their freedom. All her stories reveal such knowledge and understanding of Japans ancient culture and traditions. 
Kanthi Gunathilake spent her childhood in Colombo and attended St. Anthonys Girls School, where she excelled in Sinhala language and literature. She began professional life as a school teacher in Anuradhapura, but her life was transformed when she migrated to Japan in 1992 with her husband, a businessman. 
Her literary talents seem to have blossomed there, shaped by her love of Japan and her culture. That she lived in Ibaraki Province, 150 km from Tokyo, obviously made a deep impression on her, as her books are full of vivid descriptions of the countryside. She is a writer who deserves wider recognition.

He stages the vanishing act instead of the big event
	

The JO leaders on the strength of a wide consensus among the rank and file decided to launch a major struggle in protest against the postponing of the long overdue minor poll.

They initially planned to bring a massive crowd of protesters to lay siege to the city. They also appointed an Action Committee headed by a stalwart from Gampaha who once functioned as a chief purohita of a province as well to handle this operation to be carried out in the third week in March. While the committee members and the party leadership were waiting with great expectations for the Gampaha stalwart to swing into action with all vigour and zest at his command, the latter had quietly skipped the country.
The JO front-liners had later complained to the former strongman that they had been badly let down by the Gampaha colleague.

Health risks of Bisphenol A
	

Bisphenol A and Bisphenol S are two chemicals used with other chemicals to manufacture plastic and resin. For example, BPA is used in polycarbonate, which is a high performance, transparent, rigid plastic. This is often used as a plastic roofing light even in Sri Lanka, to get more lighting into the household. Bisphenol A used in polycarbonate is used in the manufacturing of food containers, beverage bottles, tableware, storage containers and in infant feeding bottles. Almost every plastic container used nowadays contains Bisphenol A. The residue of Bisphenol A is also present in epoxy resins used to make protective coatings and linings in food and beverage cans and wraps. The issue lies with the fact that BPA can migrate in small amounts to food and beverages stored in materials containing the substance. 
Plastic is definitely not an element created from a single substance. Plastic stands for a wide collection of chemical compounds. These chemicals are known as endocrine-disrupting compounds which means that these chemicals can mimic the hormones in the body. Bisphenol A is an endocrine disrupter which can disrupt the hormonal balance of the body. This could result in inducing activities in the estrogen including disruption in the functioning of the thyroid hormone. It also affects Antiandrogens such as male masculine features. Bisphenol A could also cause mutations. These mutations are related to certain abrasions in the chromosomes (This refers to the genetic aspects that could get affected as result of chemicals like Bisphenol A). Therefore, such mutations could eventually lead to certain types of cancer such as prostate or endometrial cancer. Generally, it can lead to chromosomal abnormalities and result in cancer formation. Fetal development could also be affected due to Bisphenol A. The sexual hormone balance could get disrupted and the underdevelopment of sex organs could take place at the fetal stage owing to the adverse effects of the chemical. BPA is very often found in feeding bottles. The early life development stage is the most influenced stage in relation to Bisphenol A. There could be birth defects, immune system suppressions and development problems as well. Consumers should not buy BPA feeding bottles and my advice is that they should go for glass feeding bottles, which are the best health option available. 
There are certain restrictions imposed on BPA worldwide. Most countries in the European Union have ensured that awareness is raised among consumers concerning the possibility of feeding bottles containing BPA or not. In European countries, Bisphenol A is subjected to regulations. According to the legislation of the European Union, Bisphenol A is subjected to regulations that guarantee a high level of protection of human beings and environment. In the European Union the manufacturer and the use of chemical substance including BPA must comply with the comprehensive legislative framework. REACH is the Regulation on Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals and constitutes the framework legislation on chemicals in the EU (Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006).

His protests were eyewash
	

A certain politico raised a hue and cry against the biggest ever PPP development project about to be kicked off shortly.

The purohita turned his office overlooking the choppy seas striking the Breakwater into an operational headquarters of a sustained campaign against the deal with a leading company from a powerful country.
However, a rumour swirling at the time also said that the campaign was a boru-show or eyewash.
Some people who believed that the hard-batting politico was the genuine article were shocked and dismayed when they learnt to their surprise that he with his sibling by his side were seen the other day exchanging pleasantries with a group of high-ups from the foreign company with whom the controversial deal was to be clinched. After all, I cannot go against a project that is intended to assure an inflow of massive funds to our country, he is said to have told the foreign investors.
Following this meeting that ended on a happy note, the foreign investors had left for Hambantota, they say.

Continuing an unprecedented winning streak, Sri Lankas leading private sector commercial bank, HNB PLC was once again awarded the Best Retail Bank for the ninth year and Best Micro Finance Product of the Year in Sri Lanka for the first time at The Asian Bankers International Excellence in Retail Financial Services Awards Programme 2017.
Taking place in conjunction with the regions most prestigious retail banking event, the Excellence in Retail Financial Services Convention, the ceremony was held at Hotel Conrad, Tokyo on March 17, 2017.
The awards were presented to HNB in recognition of its outstanding efforts to leverage cutting-edge technology to drive drastic improvements in efficiency delivering unparalleled levels of service and customer convenience through digitization and a groundbreaking approach to microfinance by offering value chain financing for micro and agro-based industries.
Over the last decade, HNB has consistently set new benchmarks for the Sri Lankan banking industry. Our latest award from the Asian Banker is emblematic of our organisations overarching commitment towards establishing a new paradigm in banking facilitated by technological innovation and excellence in service, HNB Managing Director/CEO Jonathan Alles stated.
Restructuring of branch operations together with a stronger frontline presence enabled an improved emphasis on sales and service culture for HNB during the last couple of years, a strategic decision which supported substantial growth in retail assets, operating profits and turnover, leading to one of the banks best performances, when profits after tax in 2016 surpassed US $ 94 million (Rs.14.1 billion).
Meanwhile, HNBs value chain financing product has supported maize growers from across the island to gain vital access to finance, supporting organic expansions of small-medium farming ventures. These ventures were further improved through the utilization of digital channels to reach local farmers and provide debit cards to many rural growers. The bank also used the Payfast payments platform, which offered a secure online payment processing solution.
In 2016, HNB introduced new features on its electronic banking platform to improve the user experience. The bank also introduced cash management and dealer financing options for small and medium enterprises (SMEs). In addition, HNB set-up bulk deposit acceptance machines, enabled real-time fund transfers through automated teller machines and online banking and allowed customers to access their Internet banking accounts using their Facebook profiles to log in.
HNB continues to be a true pioneer in the Sri Lankan retail banking sector and this is due in no small part to our unwavering commitment to achieving the best possible product and service standards in the country. Facilitated by digital innovations, HNB has made tremendous strides in terms of providing a highly refined, convenient customer experience.
Our latest award represents the ninth time in which HNB has been recognized as the Best Retail Bank in Sri Lanka and this continues to be a source of great pride and strength for the bank. Moving forward, we will continue to craft superior products and services in order to maintain and further consolidate our leading position in the domestic banking industry, HNB Deputy General Manager Retail and SME Banking Thimal Perera said.
Approximately 200 senior bankers from award-winning banks in 25 countries in Asia Pacific, Middle East and Africa attended the Excellence in Retail Financial Services Convention, which recognises banks efforts in bringing superior products and services to their customers.
The awards programme, administered by The Asian Banker and refereed by prominent global bankers, consultants and academics, is the most prestigious of its kind. A stringent evaluation process across three months based on a balanced and transparent scorecard determines the winners of The Asian Banker International Excellence in Retail Financial Services Awards and the positions of various retail banks in the region. 
The Asian Banker is the regions most authoritative provider of strategic business intelligence to the financial services community. The company is headquartered in Singapore, with offices in Manila, Malaysia, Hong Kong, Beijing, and Dubai, as well as representatives in London, New York and San Francisco. It has a business model that revolves around three core business lines: publications, research services and forums.

Is Europe retreating into the dark ages
	
ECJ ruling on hijab represents a huge setback for female empowerment
Amere day prior to the Ides of March, on Tuesday 14 March, Europes highest court  the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU / ECJ) delivered a shock judgement giving employers the right to prohibit Islamic headscarves in the workplace. 
In its ruling, the Luxembourg-based court held that employers who adopt a policy of neutrality and bar the display of all religious and political insignia are not in violation of the EUs anti-discriminatory laws. 
The ECJ decreed that An internal rule of an undertaking which prohibits the visible wearing of any political, philosophical or religious sign does not constitute direct discrimination. This, in essence, conferred upon employers the right to ban women from wearing headscarves at work. It was the ECJs first decision of its kind on the issue of religious attire, and came within a week of International Womens Day on March 8. 
The top courts judgement  which sets an EU-wide precedent  was delivered in the cases of two Muslim women in Belgium and France who had been dismissed from their respective workplaces for refusing to remove their hijabs. 


EU Judges held that a prohibition must be in line with an organisations established and consistent policy of projecting a neutral image. The joint verdict is therefore not a blanket ban on Islamic headscarves; it is equally applicable to manifestations of all religious beliefs such as Sikh turbans, Christian crucifixes/crosses, and Jewish skullcaps. The ECJ decision to bar religious symbols in the workplace disfavours all religious communities but worsens discrimination against Muslim women in particular, who will be disproportionately affected by the ruling. So it is a direct attack on the Islamic dress code adhered to by many Muslim women. And with it, Et tu Brute has become Et tu ECJ 
In the first case, the ECJ ruled that a Belgian firm was entitled to dismiss an employee who had begun wearing the Islamic headscarf to work on the grounds that it was contrary to company rules on appearance which required employees to dress neutrally. 
In the second case, where a French woman was fired for refusing to remove her headscarf following a customers complaint, the court re-affirmed the position it took in the first case. The judges held that the employees dismissal would be lawful if it was not in compliance with an internal company rule prohibiting the visible wearing of political, philosophical or religious beliefs. 


In other words, the only condition for the dismissals to be valid is for the firm to have followed a written or unwritten policy of so-called neutrality. As a result, it is very likely that at least some European companies will now introduce rules that explicitly prohibit the display of religious insignia. 
Under the pretext of recognising a firms right to image neutrality, the courts ruling curtails religious freedom, and feeds into (and was probably also fed by) Islamophobia, which is growing in many parts of the world. It places a barrier stymieing the entry of Muslim women who consider the hijab as a core part of their belief system into the workforce. 
Arent Muslim women being indirectly told to abandon their way of life Is it not unfair for them to be asked to choose between their faith and gainful employment Freedom of religion includes the freedom to manifest that belief in public, as acknowledged in the official ECJ statement on the ruling. So it is indeed strange to suggest that a persons religious identity should be altogether cast aside upon taking up employment. For the Muslim woman who chooses to cover because of a deeply-felt religious conviction, this is particularly difficult and problematic. 


It is also problematic because the restrictions placed on religious expression is at serious odds with the principles of freedom, justice and equality. It is worrying that a court which purports to champion justice and freedom has placed clear limits to an individuals right to exercise her or his religious freedom. The ruling puts an employers desire to project neutrality over and above the right to religious freedom. The court has thus made it lawful for employers to violate the fundamental human right to freedom of religion. Is this is not a retreat to the dark ages 
John Dalhuisen, Director of Amnesty Internationals Europe and Central Asia programme, points out that the ruling will give greater leeway for employers to discriminate against women  and men  on the grounds of religious belief. At a time when identity and appearance has become a political battleground, people need more protection against prejudice, not less.

"Islamophobia, which is growing in many parts of the world. It places a barrier stymieing the entry of Muslim women who consider the hijab as a core part of their belief system into the workforce"

The joint judgement though is framed in a neutral language directly targets Muslim women in hijab; this is exactly why the European far right is delighted with the decision. It will do nothing to promote social cohesion and multiculturalism in Europe. On the contrary, it would further marginalise and alienate Muslims in Europe by possibly preventing scores of Muslim women from entering the workforce.This would naturally result in greater resentment among all those who wish to practice their faith without fear. 
The attire of the Muslim woman has perhaps never been under greater scrutiny than it is today. This obsession with the dress code of Muslim women is unhealthy; it does bode well neither for the advancement of freedom nor womens empowerment. 
European civilisation has for long prided itself on individual freedom, proclaiming that individual liberty is sacrosanct. But the apparent discomfort in accommodating expressions of faith only signals its growing intolerance and hypocrisy. So long as fear and hostility towards the other is dominant in its psyche, European society cannot claim to be truly enlightened or liberal. That could only come with a genuine willingness to accommodate and indeed celebrate differences; certainly not by taking discreet steps towards cultural assimilation. It is now left to the respective governments in Europe and their national courts to reverse the regression by stepping in to protect the fundamental rights of its citizenry. 

The CJEU / ECJs landmark ruling:
Makes it lawful for employers to ban hijabs in the workplace 
	Could shut many Muslim women out of the workforce 
	Allows employers to override fundamental human rights 
	Represents a major step back for womens rights (Source: Amnesty International) 
	On June 12, 2006, G4S Secure Solutions NV (G4S), a private undertaking in Belgium, dismissed Samira Achbita, who had been working as a receptionist since February 2003, because she informed the company of her intention to start wearing the headscarf in the workplace. Employees in G4S were subjected to an unwritten, and from the following day, a written prohibition on religious and philosophical symbols in the work place. 
	In another case, on June 22, 2009, Micropole SA, a private undertaking based in France, dismissed Asma Bougnaoui, who had been working as a design engineer for the company since 15 July 2008, because she wanted to continue wearing the headscarf when providing services to the companys clients. Micropole SA pointed out in the letter of dismissal that employees had to respect a policy of neutrality vis--vis its clients. 
	Amnesty International, together with the European Network Against Racism, submitted to the Court that both the measures imposed by G4S Solutions NV and Micropole SA on their employees constitute discrimination based on religion or belief.

JO questions PMs honesty
	
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghes assurance that the Government would only allow the participation of foreign observers and not foreign judges in an accountability mechanism to look into war crime charges was untrue and dishonest, the Joint Opposition said today.
It said the Premier did not come up with a clear and a direct answer to their Leader MP Dinesh Gunawardanes question in Parliament on Tuesday as to how Sri Lanka agreed upon to a resolution which called for foreign judges in a local judicial mechanism, when both the President and the Premier were against such a move.
The sixth clause of the resolution, which was adopted by the UN Human Rights Council says ..Also affirms in this regard the importance of participation in a Sri Lankan judicial mechanism, including the special counsels office, of Commonwealth and other foreign judges, defence lawyers and authorized prosecutors and investigators.
The UNHRC resolution which was adopted in October 2015, clearly and directly mentions about the involvement of foreign judges in a local accountability mechanism. There is no mention of foreign observers in the resolution, Professor G.L.Peiris told a news conference. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Lankan nabbed for alleged sexual and physical assault in Malaysia
	
A Sri Lankan national allegedly assaulted two women sexually and physically in Bandar Baru Uda in Malaysia, the Malaysian media reported.
He was later arrested by police on Monday evening.
In the first case, the suspect allegedly assaulted a 51-year-old factory worker, and robbed her of her mobile phone, ATM card, and RM80 cash at around 7.14am on March 19.
Johor Baru (North) OCPD Asst Comm Mohd Taib Ahmad said the victim had just got off from a bus and was walking towards her workplace at a food factory in Tampoi in Johor Baru before the suspect attacked her.
The victim, who sustained several injuries, was found lying on the side of the road by the public who alerted the police. She was brought to Hospital Sultanah Aminah in a semiconscious state.
Initial investigation showed that the suspect had punched the victim several times, causing her to suffer bruises on her face, eyes and head, and a split lip.
The victim received two stitches on her forehead, he told The Star.
ACP Mohd Taib said the second victim was a 27-year-old woman who works at an electronics factory in Bandar Baru Uda.
He said the victim was waiting at a bus-stop along Jalan Padi 1 at 4am on March 20 before being approached by the suspect who tried to force her to sit next to him.
The victim refused to do so and the suspect began strangling her before dragging her to a nearby bush area where he tried to molest her.
She screamed loudly which alerted a male passerby, but the suspect had already fled the scene, he said.
ACP Mohd Taib said that police spotted a man who fit the description made by one of the victims walking along Jalan Padi 1 here at around 6.30pm on March 20.
He said the suspect, in his late 30s, tried to escape but the police successfully arrested him following a scuffle. The mobile phone that was stolen from the first victim was found on the suspect.
ACP Mohd Taib added the suspect was being remanded to assist in the investigation under Section 394 of the Penal Code and Section 354 of the same Act for robbery and causing hurt as well as for assault on person with the intent of outraging her modesty.

When you have eaten a very large meal, your blood supply gets transferred to your stomach, so if you do any form of exercise or go swimming you can cramp. If a person with a heart problem does this there can be an issue. For young people in general, there is no problem. Generally, we tell people to eat two hours before exercising but light meals are fine. In fact, when training, during pre-workout and post-work out, you have to eat as you need energy.

New laws to legalize previous bond sales
	
The Government will introduce new laws to make all previous bond sales legal and to govern sale of bonds and treasury bills in the future, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe informed Parliament yesterday.
The Prime Minister in his response to a question asked by joint opposition parliamentary group leader Dinesh Gunawardane said this new legislation would include provisions to legalise the sale of bonds in the past. "Legalising all past bond sales is necessary because problems may arise when it is time for buyers to redeem them," he said.
The Prime Minister said the main objective of the new legislation was to stop the gazetting of bond sales after they are issued. All governments have followed a procedure of issuing gazette notices after the sale of bonds. He said a then deputy finance minister Sarath Amunugama had to issue a gazette notice for a bond sale which had taken place during the time of his predecessor K. N. Choksy.
The Prime Minister said new laws would- also bring provisions to govern the primary dealers and to ensure transparency. (Yohan Perera and Ajith Siriwardana)

Office on  Missing  Persons,  in limbo
	
The Office on Missing Persons (OMP) is one of the four main pillars of Sri Lankas transitional justice agenda which promises accountability and justice. The OMP is considered to be an important step in addressing the issue of missing persons and enforced disappearances.
Though this Act was passed in Parliament last August it has not yet been signed by the President and its responsibility has not been assigned to a minister. Thus currently it is not in operation. Legislation to amend the Office on Missing Persons Act has been drafted and will be presented in Parliament soon.
Accordingly clause 11(a) of the Act which grants power to enter into agreements, as are necessary to achieve the mandate of the OMP, with any person or organization, will be repealed. While certain parties are completely opposed to the setting up of the OMP on grounds that the office targets war heroes and that available mechanisms could be utilized for redress, other activists highlight the delay in establishing the office to be a grave concern.
In the light of this amendment which was initially proposed by the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP), the Daily Mirror spoke to some concerned parties who said that the urgency seen in the passing of the Act was no longer visible, and instead there was a delay in setting it up. 

There is a lackof understanding of the purposeof the OMP
- Dr. Jehan Perera 
Executive Director of the National Peace Council
	A bill amending the Office on Missing Persons Act will be presented to Parliament
	
Dr. Jehan Perera said that if the repeal of Section 11(a) facilitated the activation of the OMP it was an acceptable compromise. There is a lack of understanding of the purpose of the OMP which has led to concern that it is injurious to members of the security forces who fought the war and insurrections of the past. This may be the main reason for the delay in implementing the OMP law. A bill amending the Office on Missing Persons Act will be presented to Parliament that repeals section 11 (a). There seems to have been concern that the OMP would enter into agreements with international organizations. As the OMP would be led by persons of eminence appointed by the Constitutional Council, I think this is an exaggerated fear. But if facilitates the activation of the OMP it is an acceptable compromise, he said. 
He added that though the law establishing the OMP was passed by Parliament more than six months ago, it has not been operationalized and was only on paper. This undermines Sri Lankas position at the ongoing session of the UN Human Rights Council where the government has to report back on its implementation of the commitments it made in Geneva in October 2015 when it co-sponsored the resolution of the UN Human Rights Council on Sri Lanka, he noted. 
The OMP is not only about finding out what happened to those who went missing in the war, it is also to find out what happened to those missing that stretch back decades and the insurrections that took place in both the North and South of the country and were bloodily suppressed. The OMP is to help them to end the search, and to bring closure to that open wound that exists in the body politic, he said adding that the OMP law constituted the maximum effort that the Sri Lankan state can take to find out where victims were if they were alive and if not alive what happened to them. This is why the law provides that evidence that is not admissible in courts of law is admissible in the OMP investigation. This is also why evidence that is confidential is permissible, which even the Right to Information Act cannot access, he added. 

The President hasnt signed it yet. We are worried.
- Brito Fernando
President of the Families of the Disappeared
	The President hasnt signed it yet. We are worried.
	
We have been expecting a legal body of this form for a very long period. We didnt get any institution or mechanism to know what actually happened, to get the truth out. In 1990 Chandrika Bandaranaike appointed commissions to look into the disappearance of people during the period 1988/1989. People gave evidence and a list of those who were responsible was prepared. But action was not instituted, said Brito Fernando, the President of the Families of the Disappeared. 
People question about the whereabouts of their friends and relatives: is he alive Or not If he has been killed, why By whom The OMP Act says they will look into them and let people know what happened, he said.  He added that though there were short comings the OMP has given people new hope to know the truth. But the President hasnt signed it yet. We are worried. The families are worried, he said. 

Independence of the OMP is being taken away in the form of removing 11(a)
- Shreen Saroor
Founder of Mannar Womens Development Federation (MWDF) and Mannar Women for Human Rights and Democracy (MWFHRD)
	We must move forward as a country on the transitional justice process
	
Shreen Saroor, the Founder of Mannar Womens Development Federation (MWDF) and Mannar Women for Human Rights and Democracy (MWFHRD said that the government was delaying the establishment of the OMP and was weakening its power through an amendment because it now believes to have won over the international community. We must move forward as a country on the transitional justice process, not because somebody is giving an incentive or honour in the form of GSP +. We shouldnt work for that. There are so many people missing in the country. The government has to genuinely work on establishing the OMP at the same rate as it wanted to do last year. All of a sudden we see that the government is dragging its feet because the government feels that it has won over the international community. That is the reason why theyre delaying the establishment and also weakening the OMP by removing 11(a), Saroor said. 
She said that the independence of the OMP is being taken away in the form of removing 11(a). The North east women who are looking for their kith and kin, want some kind of hybridity in the OMP, particularly in getting forensic assistance and foreign expertise coming into the process, particularly, in relation to the mass graves. The Prime Minister has suggested the removal of paragraph 11(a) which comes under the general mandate of the OMP where they can contract experts independently. So the independence of the OMP is to some extent being taken away in the form of removing 11A, she said. 
The government rushed and established the OMP, while the consultation was going on with the victims. The cabinet paper was passed just after the consultation task force was appointed and we were told by the Foreign Minister that the government wanted to set up the OMP as soon as possible because of International pressure as Sri Lanka was applying for GSP +. Even in Geneva, the Foreign Minister promised to set up the OMP, but the President has not signed the OMP, she added. 

This is a terrible piece of legislation against the interests of Sri Lankans
- Manohara de Silva 
Presidents Counsel
	The police can file action. They are not immune
	
	
	This is nothing but a mechanism for foreigners to come and interfere with our investigations
	

Presidents Counsel Manohara de Silva said that the OMP was not about finding missing people, but rather prosecuting war heroes. This has to be understood in the light of the UN High Commissioners report and the resolution which facilitates the setting up of an office aiming at investigation and prosecution. If they think of prosecuting people in this country it must be done by the police and the Attorney Generals Department. You dont need another office for prosecution, he said. 
Stating that certain NGOs and other parties with Sri Lankan citizenship were acting against the best interests of the state De Silva pointed out that the OMP Act allowed people to be summoned at any time and that confessions obtained were valid before a court of law. They can summon anybody day or night and record statements. If a confession is made to a police officer under the evidence ordinance it is not admissible. But when they record statements the confessions will be admissible, he said adding that confessions will be forcibly extracted. 
If there are independent commissions, and if the judiciary and the police are independent why are they wasting public funds to set up another office They can get the National police commission to look into this. Otherwise they should admit to the public that our police and judiciary are not independent. This is nothing but a mechanism for foreigners to come and interfere with our investigations and somehow punish war heroes, and to see that in future insurrections, no one joins our military, he said noting that if war heroes had been told that an office of this nature would be set up in future to penalize them, they would not have gone to the war front. 


When asked if he believed that soldiers who have committed war crimes should also be protected he said there was a law and if they had committed war crimes they can be court-martialled. The police can file action. They are not immune. The objection is not towards investigation, but to investigation by these ad-hoc people, he said. 
Remarking that he did not want the act to be amended to hoodwink the public he pointed out that even if the clause was removed there was no provision preventing such agreements. Are they going to have NGO personnel in this office Thats quite possible. When you go through the Act the intention appears to be so. They didnt think twice when establishing the FCID as a separate unit of the police to prosecute our own people. So why cant they have a another special unit to deal with missing persons 
Responding to his question he said that it was because there was an uproar against hybrid courts that instead of having foreign judges the government now attempted to establish this office to bring people forcibly and make confessions. They want to fix the leaders who led the army. This is a terrible piece of legislation against the interests of Sri Lankans, he said. 

There is no OMP investigations will get delayed
- Niran Anketell
Attorney-at-Law
	You may need a specialist organization todo DNA testing on a mass scale
	
	
	The OMP doesnt exist because the law says that the relevant minister has to gazette itinto operation
	
Attorney-at-Law Niran Anketell pointed out that the office has not been established and that complaints were not received. The OMP doesnt exist because the law says that the relevant minister has to gazette it into operation. It is the President who decides which minister is responsible for the OMP. The President hasnt assigned it yet to a minister. We have understood that the Prime Minister advised the President to gazette it to him. But the President has either refused or is unwilling to do it. Therefore there is no OMP and therefore no one can make complaints and investigations will get delayed. 
Once the relevant minister gazettes it the constitutional council will have to nominate the members to be appointed. It is only when the members are appointed that the office can exist. The office is the legal body that has not yet been created, he added.  Highlighting the importance of clause 11(a) Anketell said that a clause permitting the OMP to enter into agreement with local or international bodies was introduced for several reasons. The ICRC which has a lot of information in this regards, will not hand over that information unless they have a guarantee of confidentiality. You can have a guarantee of confidentiality through an agreement.  Or you may need a specialist organization to do DNA testing on a mass scale. We dont have that here and will have to be brought from outside. It was for that purpose that clause was introduced. But subsequently it was weakened, even in parliament, he added. Stating that the JVP proposed the deletion of this clause at the committee stage he said that there was confusion as to whether the leader of the house had accepted the JVP amendment. When the final draft came out that clause was only amended and was not fully deleted, as the JVP wanted. Then the JVP made a fuss saying that they introduced this amendment and that the government agreed to the amendment, but the final Act did not reflect the agreement in parliament. Now they have introduced the amendment to delete that clause in line with the JVPs suggestion, he added. 
According to him now there is a question as to whether the OMP will be able to enter into agreements. Normally you have the power to enter into agreements that are necessary for the body to fulfill its own functions, whether or not it is stated in the law. If they had not written it into the law in the first place certainly those agreement would have been possible. But now that it was introduced and taken out politically there could be an issue if the OMP starts entering into these agreements, he said.

One too many for the ride
	

Number One recently decided to helicopter it to Wellawaya to attend a public function there. He had not invited any purohita to accompany him on this ride.

However, to Number Ones surprise, Long J from Wattala who had got wise to the arranged flight had arrived at the helipad where he was waiting for the helicopter. 
Meanwhile, another purohita, a Green-turned Blue from Raigam Korale had arrived at the scene. Sir, may I too hop in so that we can proceed to Pelmadulla to attend the funeral there soon after the Wellawaya function
Number One making no immediate reply was mulling over the Raigam purohitas request, when a PSD high-up addressed him: Sir, there is room in the helicopter only for two special passengers.
Number One had remained quiet.
In the meantime, the helicopter for Number One arrived and was ready to take in passengers. Number One first boarded the craft. Long J followed suit saying he too wanted to attend the funeral in Pelmadulla. The doors of the helicopter were closed and the helicopter took off leaving behind the purohita from Raigam Korale.
The purohita had been so sure that he would be able to make it to Wellawaya along with Number One, he had already dispatched his official vehicle to the place where the craft was due to land.
So the disappointed one had been compelled to get down another official vehicle to get back home, they say.

The President had decided not to use a special flight even on this significant visit and the President and his delegation would visit Russia by an ordinary passenger flight, PMD said.
Even during his previous visits, the President and his delegation did not use any special flights as it was a principle, it said.
According to the Russian Governments culture, officially invited State leaders and the delegation should arrive by a special flight to a special terminal to offer special greetings.
Despite the special welcome ceremony by the Russian Army, President Sirisena had decided to leave for Russia by an ordinary passenger flight. (Chaturanga Pradeep)

Ranjan appreciates JO's complaints against 'Top Ten'
	
Deputy Minister Ranjan Ramanayake said today he appreciated the Joint Opposition's move to lodge complaints with the Bribery Commission (BC) against the government politicians what they termed as "Top Ten" because it was easy to identify real thieves when the thieves attacked one another.
Speaking at the debate to revise the limits of Bribery Raids Advance Account of the Bribery Commission, Mr. Ramanayake said it was not important who lodged the complaint but what was important was to recover the money stolen.
"We must thank MP Mahindananda Aluthgamage for making complaints at the BC against government MPs. It was not important who makes the complaint. What is important is to give the stolen money back to the people. These are not media shows. These things should happen," he said.
He said the former Bribery Commission Director General Dilrukshi Dias Wickramasinghe, who was working efficiently, had to leave her post due to the dubious allegations against her.
"Thieves won and Ms. Wickramasinghe was defeated. Today those who accused her are also going to the BC," he said.
He said the remuneration and perks of the MPs should be reduced and increases the salaries and allowances of BC, FCID and CID officials and added that these institutions should be strengthened.
He said some politicians of the previous government had evaded the BC' s investigations citing ludicrous reasons during the previous regime.(Ajith Siriwardana and Yohan Perera)

Remembrance on his 75th birth anniversary: Was Gamini Dissanayake a racist
	
In the annals of the civil war that raged between the Sri Lankan security forces and Tamil militants led by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Ealam (LTTE) and other terrorist organizations, the burning of the Jaffna Public Library was a momentous event. It has been chronicled that an organized mob of Sinhalese origin went on a rampage on the night of June 1, 1981, burning the library. In the fair opinion of many independent observers, it was one of the most vicious examples of ethnic biblioclasm of the 20th century. At the time of its destruction, the library was considered one of the major libraries in Asia, containing over 97,000 books and manuscripts. 
According to ill-founded rumours, roguishly generated by powerful insiders of the then UNP-led government itself, among the main culprits who led this insensitive and cold-hearted plunder was Gamini Dissanayake, the then Minister of Mahaweli and Land Development and a very close associate of President J R Jayewardene. However, in terms of the contents of the memoirs of Edward Gunawardene, the then Deputy Inspector General of Police, Gamini was vindicated beyond any reasonable doubt, of this dastardly act. Nevertheless, propagandists of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) and its Presidential Candidate in 1994 went to town on this unfounded allegation that Gamin was behind the burning of the library. Dr. Carlo Fonseka, a well-known social scientists and aloud hailer for the so-called left was one of the main antagonists who accused Gamini, without any evidential material in his possession. He used the presidential elections-platform to hurl these innuendos, posing as an authentic source of information.



Yet it was quite magnanimous of Carlo Fonseka to have dissociated from these false allegations after reading Edward Gunawardenes memoirs. He went as far as admitting to being delusional at the time he was indulging in these falsehoods. According to his own words, EG was our man on the spot and he was an eye-witness to the event. Chapter XI titled: Who burnt the Jaffna library gives a clear, authoritative and comprehensive account of the Jaffna Library Fire. It riveted my attention. It disabused my mind of an illusion, or rather I should say, a delusion. In psychiatry, a delusion is defined as a false belief persisted in despite evidence to the contrary. I now think that the period in question was one in which the time was out of joint in our country and EG was born to set the historical record right. Owing to my delusion that it was Minister Gamini Dissanayake who burnt the Jaffna Library, I became guilty of an act which will remain a permanent source of regret in my life. Allow me to use the privilege of appearing on this platform to try and make amends for the injustice I inflicted on Gamini. 


My own account of these allegations about the burning of the Jaffna Library might be even more relevant in that as Gaminis Private Secretary at the time, I am fairly sure that GD, as he was fondly called by his close associates, was nowhere near Jaffna. He was engaged in the District Council election campaign in another district in Uva Province. I was in Nuwara Eliya at the time and we learnt about the burning of the Library late night on June 1, 1981. But today some Tamils, both in Sri Lanka and overseas still believe that it was Gamini who was responsible for the burning of the treasure trove of the learned in the peninsula. Unfortunately for him, Carlo Fonseka came out clean a way too late and after his demise. Even that came after the publishing of the memoirs of Edward Gunawardene. Consequently, in the context of vindication and clearing of Gaminis name and removing one blemish, if any, that he had on his name, Carlo Fonsekas confession has no meaning, nor does it have any weight, to be really honest. Gamini, when he was living and even after his demise, is being judged in the most unfortunate fashion. While the Tamils, especially the Diaspora passed judgment on Gamini as an anti-Tamil and a racist, some Sinhalese leaders, specifically in the so-called intelligentsia and some current politicians, labelled him as a pro-Tamil politician. That indeed is a very unfortunate status a politician would like to find himself in. Remember, Gamini was one of the victims of the murderous suicide gang of Prabhakaran. He was killed by the LTTE and he was hated by the militant Tamil organizations. And one other major causes for which Gamini was held in contempt by both fringes, anti-Sinhalese and anti-Tamil, for his bold and creative role he played in the crafting and implementing the 13th Amendment to our Constitution. 


"Detractors and critics of Gamini might indulge themselves in perverted pleasure of disparaging him as a racist or a traitor to the cause of Sinhalese - Buddhists"

All this and other related events and information need to be taken into serious consideration when one ascertains whether Gamini was a racist or not. Oxford Dictionary defines racist as thus: someone who believes that other races are not as good as their own and, therefore, treats them unfairly. In terms of that definition, most of todays Sinhalese politicians, including the leaders of the last regime of the Rajapaksas are confirmed racists. But Gamini, whether in the narrow context of the definition of the word, or when taken against a backdrop of the vast programmes undertaken by him, his public conduct of affairs and when staffing and obtaining professional advice from his private and official staff, Gamini was one single leader in the government of J R Jayewardene from 1977 to 1989 and thereafter until his death who remained a very balanced human being as a private individual and an exemplary politician who wished to serve Sri Lanka as one single nation without any prejudice towards any person or a group or class of persons based purely on race, caste, faith. 


Sri Lanka today is not the same country that was there during Gaminis life which spanned only 52 years. The illuminating effect Gamini had on the landscape of politics, his passionate involvement with whatever the subject he handled at the time, his courageous stances on politically sensitive issues were all traits of an admirable politician whose commitment to the lofty ideals of politics was total and complete as it could possibly be. His appeal to varied issues that confronted Sri Lanka in the last couple of decades of the last century might not be relevant today. But his engagement with those issues and the methodology and equanimous attitude towards those issues do matter in any time, past, present or future. His exposure to the geopolitical equations that were in play, his more-than-cordial relationships with global leaders, he being accepted as one single person in whom one can place full trust when engaging in matters political, industrial, trade or whatever relevant to the very existence of our country as a sovereign member of the family of nations. 
Detractors and critics of Gamini might indulge themselves in perverted pleasure of disparaging him as a racist or a traitor to the cause of Sinhalese-Buddhists. Voyages into search of truth may be hard and filled with many a storm and tempest; they may be navigating some of the most modern and state-of-the-art ship and your ultimate port might be a deserted island or a utopian land. But when voters are asked to cast their votes in an election, when they are asked to place their trust in one single person to navigate that ship in troubled waters and in stormy environs, Gaminis name would appear right on top. All the past election results in respect of his performance in them were ample testimony to his magic appeal and ensuing readiness to embrace the electorate as his brothers and sisters from wherever they appeared, North, South, East or West. 


"Allegations about the burning of the Jaffna Library might be even more relevant in that as Gaminis Private Secretary at that time, I am fairly sure that he was nowhere near Jaffna"

Danish philosopher, Soren Kierkegaard said: I see it all perfectly; there are two possible situations - one can either do this or that. My honest opinion and my friendly advice is this: do it or do not do it - you will regret both. In that context, let me share with you some info which I have not shared with anyone to date. During the Presidential Election campaign in 1994, Hamilton Wanasinghe, the then JOC Commander, contacted me and asked me to advise Gamini not to visit the East. When I asked him why, he said that there was imminent threat to his life from the Tigers. At the time the Chandrika Bandaranaike government had given bare minimum security to Gamini and majority of the security personnel was from private sources. When I intimated this to him, his reply was thus: Palitha, I am a politician, my place is among the people. If I decide to get away from that environ, then I must get out of politics. In fact I could not cancel any commitment that he had made to the campaign schedule. In hindsight, that was the undoing of Gamini Dissanayake. Yet, when all pens were down and voices were mute, from D S Senanayake to the current President and Premier, Gamini Dissanayake stands singularly as a Sinhalese Buddhist leader who stood by the basic Buddhist principle of 
Najachcha Wasalo Hothi, Najachcha Hothi Brahmano 
Kammana Wasalo Hothi, Kammana Hothi Brahmano 
One does not outcast by birth or Genius by birth 
Thus will be outcast by deed or will be genius by deed

During a press conference held at the Ministry, Minister Ranawaka made these remarks in connection with the construction of a liquor distillery in Kalkuda, Batticaloa.
We are against those who open liquor distilleries in the North and Uva provinces, as special relief was given to those areas because of the poverty levels, not to open liquor distilleries. The main intension of the tax concessions is to develop the province and create employment opportunities, he said. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

## Title: The dark side of fairness creams

The dark side of fairness creams
	
The desire for fairer skin and the fascination with fairness creams is not something new to Sri Lankans. South Asians in general have been obsessed with fairness and both men and women go to great lengths to achieve it. The demand for fairness creams and other similar products seem to be increasing with the social notion that fair skin is beautiful. Porcelain skin has been the measure of beauty in China since ancient times. Even in Japan, beauty has been linked to a lighter skin tone. The widespread preference for fair skin has been exploited by manufacturers and the simple fact that over-the-counter fairness products are easily accessible and affordable has played a major role when it comes to consumption. 
The Sri Lankan market is experiencing a stronger demand for fairness products due to advertising and untapped markets targeting rural segments. Fairness products have become a vital product for men and women of all age groups and the easy availability of these products in urban as well as rural parts of the country has helped expand the demand. There are two sides to everything and the downside to fairness products is not at all beautiful. 
spoke to Dr. Saman Gunasekara, a Dermatologist on how fairness products can be harmful to the skin. 
There is a belief that white or fair skin is beautiful in most South Asian countries and there is a rising demand for fairness creams and other similar products. Most of these products are easily available. There are various types of fairness products that are manufactured locally as well as internationally. These products promise to make you look more beautiful and give you a fairer complexion. Some of these dont come with a proper label or a description of the ingredients used to make them but people still tend to use them on the recommendation of their beauticians. The quality of these could be compromised as the ingredients used to manufacture some of them have not been mentioned. 
Another downside is that there is no certified lab or a place in which their quality can be tested. A lack of a proper testing place is not the only problem, as Sri Lanka doesnt even have proper regulations when it comes to this subject. 
Various side effects may occur if you use certain fairness products without them being prescribed to you, as the quality of the product could be tampered with. There are many fairness creams out there that contain corticosteroid drugs used to treat eczema, psoriasis and various skin-related illnesses. These fairness creams could cause early reactions such as skin irritation, redness or allergic contact dermatitis. Long-term side effects such as severe acne could also occur owing to the overuse of these products. Though these drugs do not directly increase the risk of skin cancer, they have been associated with an increased incidence of skin cancer later in life.  Photosensitivity (which causes increased sensitivity to sunlight) is another side-effect that may occur. Hydroquinones used in some fairness products can damage melanocytes which produces a pigment that can cause white patches on the skin which could be permanent. These fairness creams sometimes contain arsenic or mercury too and over using such products could ultimately lead to skin cancer. 
What seems to attract people towards fairness products so much than the fairness product itself seem to be the mindset and peoples attitudes. Other peoples perception of you doesnt really matter and what really matters is your perception of yourself. Fairness products cannot thrive without being supported by a societys obsession with flaunting fair skin. When it comes to finding a solution to this specific problem, we need to work on changing the social notion on what is considered beautiful.

There are better means to defeat Islamic State than armies: Iraqi prime minister
	

By Carol Morello  (c) 2017, The Washington Post   Mar 21, 2017 - 
WASHINGTON - Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi said Monday after a meeting at the White House that there are better ways for the United States to help beat back the Islamic State than sending combat troops. 
Though Abadi praised the Trump administration as being willing to become more engaged in the fight against Islamist militants in Iraq and Syria, he warned that sending sizable numbers of troops would not defeat them. The United States has stepped up the deployment of ground troops to Syria, and elsewhere in the region, as the Iraqi army advances on Mosul and a complex array of forces prepare for an offensive on the Islamic State capital of Raqqa in Syria. 
We have to be careful, Abadi said at the U.S. Institute of Peace, where he spoke shortly after talking with President Donald Trump, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and other senior U.S. officials. Committing troops is one thing. Fighting terrorism is another thing. You dont defeat terrorism by fighting it militarily. There are better ways. 
Echoing themes that were common from State Department officials during the Obama administration, Abadi said governments and militaries succeed only if they win the trust and support of the civilian population through measures like anti-corruption reforms and good governance. 
We have to bring back trust in the way we govern, he said. It will be sad day for all of us if people believe a dictatorship is better than democracy. Because if democracy doesnt protect them, doesnt provide for them, if there is corruption, ... I think we failed. 
Abadi is among officials from 68 countries in Washington this week for a meeting of the U.S.-led global coalition to fight the jihadist group in Syria and Iraq. Abadi, who came to Washington seeking more financial aid and assistance in rebuilding ruined cities, said the White House has assured Iraq it will get more support than the Obama administration offered. 
We have been given assurances support will not only continue, but will accelerate until we complete the task, he said after predicting the Iraqi army is in the last stage of pushing Islamic State militants out of Mosul, a city of more than 1 million people that is an Islamic State stronghold. 
Just before meeting with Abadi in the Cabinet Room at the White House, Trump praised Iraqi soldiers for their advances in Mosul against the jihadists who are also known by the acronymn of ISIS. 
Mosul is moving along, he said. We will figure something out. I mean, we have to get rid of ISIS. Were going to get rid of ISIS. 
Abadi showed flashes of humor that seemed to poke gentle fun at Trump and his predicament. 
While posing for photos in the Oval Office, a reporters question about Trumps reaction to testimony in Congress undercutting his assertion that Trump Tower in New York was wiretapped on President Barack Obamas orders prompted Abadi to grab Trumps arm and reassure him jokingly, We had nothing to do with the wiretap. 
And at the end of his moderated talk at the Institute of Peace, Abadi appeared to draw a parallel between Iraqs sectarian divisions and the border between the United States and Mexico. 
When he was asked if he supported a semi-autonomous region for minorities in northern Iraq, Abadi said he preferred a more inclusive society. 
I dont think you protect yourself by having to partition yourself from your neighbours, he said. We have to build bridges with others, and work with others, to be more secure. Otherwise, you build walls. 
After a momentarily pause in the audience of about 100 people, the room burst into laughter.

They haggled over the percentage!
	

A local investor and his foreign partner of a construction firm, which was awarded the contract for an express project in the upcountry, the other day called at the office of a purohita on invitation.

Soon after their arrival, the purohita too made his appearance.
Coming down to business straightaway, the purohita informed the investors that he expected a five per cent commission but did not mind settling for four. The investors said what they could really afford was only one per cent but they were prepared to go up to two per cent.
The politico who looked ruffled by this reply, said: I am prepared to give you time to reconsider my proposition.
Having reconsidered the proposition, the investors have now decided not to go beyond the two per cent they had already conceded, they say.

Today is World Water Day: Water scarcity A serious threat to lives
	
In a bid to focus attention on the importance of fresh water and advocating for the sustainable management of water resources, world water day is held annually on March 22nd 
The United Nations General assembly responded by designating 22nd March as the World Water Day.. 
Thus, March 22, 1993 was the first World Water Day.
Water needed for survival 
All living beings need water for survival. It has been proved that a living being on earth should breathe, drink and eat to live on.Without breathing one can live only for a short spell of time counted in seconds and minutes. One can live a longer period without food than without water. It has been proved that the longest time that one can live without water is seven days.
International decade of action on water for life 2005-2015 
The United Nations General Assembly at its 58th session in December 2003agreed to proclaim the years 2005 -2015 as the International decade of action on water for life and March 22 as the Worlds Water Day. An attempt was made to ensure the participation of women in water related development efforts. The increasing significance of water scarcity and the need for increased integration and cooperation to ensure sustainable and equitable management of scarce water resources both at international and local levels was highlighted. 
Serious problems to be faced by users of water throughout the world 
The Director-General of Food and Agricultural Organization (F.A.O} said on World Water Day2007, Fourteen percent of the fresh water will need to be withdrawn for agricultural purposes in the next thirty years to cater to the global population which is expected to reach 8.1 billion by 2030, he said. The pressure on water resources intensifies paving way to tensions and conflicts.
Human activities contributing to the water crisis 
A severe water crisis will occur in the world approximately nine years from now as a result of human activities. On World Water Day, United Nations call on every one to be prepared to face the water crisis that will take place in the near future.Three-fourths of the fresh water that people use every day come from forested catchment areas.
Water scarcity in Sri Lanka at present for cultivation 
About 50,000 Hectares of paddy lands which were cultivated in the Yala season had been destroyed due to the lack of water and only 40 percent of the families were able to reap a harvest this year. Many farmlands are being affected by the droughtThe Department of Irrigation announced that water can be distributed only to 60 percent of paddy lands 
Scarcity of drinking water
The water sources of many villages in the districts of Polonnaruwa, Batticaloa, Trincomalee Kilinochchi, Vavunia, Monaragala, Ratnapura and Kurunegala districts have dried up. More than 51.000 families that are directly affected by the drought engage in a daily struggle to obtain the water that is being distributed by bowsers. Drought conditions are a seasonal occurrence in these areas. In certain areas of the Anuradhapura district there is only one well that provides clean drinking water to multiple villages.
There is the urgent need to implement sustainable plans
Conflicts among nations with water as the bone of contention are not recent ones. It was Gautama Buddha who mediated in a conflict between Sakyans and Kolians and taught the world the principles of water management.The Enlightened One intervened in the deadly war launched among His relatives for the water of river Rohini.. This river flowing between the borders of Sakya and Koliya Kingdoms provided irrigation facilities for farmlands in both kingdoms.
Farmers and rulers who knew nothing about water management resorted to a deadly war without arriving at a compromise to share the river water.The Enlightened One who envisaged the impending danger appeared before the rival groups. He explained to them the ill effects of fighting over the natural resource for which both sides had equal rights.
Have we achieved World Water day themes of the previous decade 
Water for the 21st century was the theme for the year 2000,Water for development for the year 2002, and Water for the futurefor the year 2004. These themes indicate that it is the responsibility of every one of us in making drinking water and sanitation available to future generations. We should act accordingly if we are to achieve the MillenniumDevelopment goal.

"About 50,000 Hectares of paddy lands which were cultivated in the Yala season had been destroyed due to the lack of water and only 40 percent of the families were able to reap a harvest this year"

Unhappy for being blamed for something he cant help
	

There is a white collar bigwig heading an independent commission responsible for electing the peoples representatives.

These days this bigwig is being inundated with complaints about the inordinate delay in holding an important poll. Even the ordinary people whom he meets in the street fault him for delaying the poll and he has even become the butt of criticism of the local Facebook community as well, they say.
This bigwig is a very unhappy person these days for being the target of much blame for a crime against the people about which he is helpless, they say.

Unite to End Tuberculosis Leave No One Behind
	

With Unite to End TB: Leave No One Behind being the World Health Organizations theme for World Tuberculosis Day 2017 scheduled for March 24 every year, it is time that we reflect upon how best we could address the issue of stigma, discrimination and marginalization attached to the disease. According to WHO statistics, 49 million lives were saved from Tuberculosis as a result of effective diagnosis and treatment from 2000-2015. The number of Multi-Drug Resistant patients reported globally in 2015, amounted to 480,000.
According to the Global Tuberculosis Report 2016 released by the World Health Organization there were an estimated 10.4 million new TB cases identified worldwide in 2015.
An estimated 1.4 million TB deaths were recorded worldwide in the same year. In a candid interview with Health Capsule, Consultant Paediatrician at the Lady Ridgeway Hospital Dr. Deepal Perera enlightened us on how Tuberculosis could jeopardize the health of a person while further explaining on the red flag signs that should be taken to account and the treatment options available to cure the disease.


What is Tuberculosis
Tuberculosis is a disease caused by a micro bacterium known as Mycobacterium Tuberculosis that affects the lungs of a person with low immunity. It is an airborne disease that spreads through Airborne Droplet Infection. The disease is spread from one adult to another or from an adult to a child. However, the disease can never be spread from a child to an adult. It is a slow-growing bacteria that gradually affects the lungs. It is also a treatable and preventable disease. Tuberculosis is mainly a disease involving the lungs but it can spread to the brain, kidney, bone and other organs as well. As such it is a systematic disease. 
Is the disease currently on the rise
Tuberculosis has been on the rise for the past twenty years. It is a deadly disease. Globally, as the rate of HIV patients increase, the potential for a subsequent increase in the rate of Tuberculosis patients is also very high. This is mainly because HIV patients are prone to contract Tuberculosis. Professor Robert Koch identified the disease and discovered a treatment for Tuberculosis. It is called Koch Disease in the presence of the patient; owing to the stigma attached, but it should also be noted that Tuberculosis is nevertheless a treatable disease. 
How exactly can an individual contract the disease and how does the disease affect the lungs of a patient
Tuberculosis is a contagious disease that could spread from an adult to adult or adult to child. It is an airborne disease. If a patient with Tuberculosis coughs, the tiny saliva droplets could travel through air to the lungs of a healthy person during inhalation; thereby he or she could contract the disease. Tuberculosis could also cause infection in the throat and skin. This is mainly because when the bacteria affect the lungs, through the blood the disease could spread to other parts of the body as well. When the disease affects the lungs we call it as primary disease mainly because the droplets first get deposited in the lungs. In order to react against the bacteria, the lymph nodes in the lungs get enlarged. As a result the patient starts coughing. 
What are the symptoms related to the disease
Patients will experience prolonged cough, continuous fever for more than two weeks, loss of appetite and loss of weight as the initial symptoms. Sometimes, children may experience lymph node enlargement in the neck too. 
In the case of adults, they will experience symptoms of secondary tuberculosis. Symptoms may include cavitation of the lungs, chronic cough with blood including poor appetite, fever and loss of weight as in the case of child patients. 

Why do patients cough with a spray of blood after contracting Tuberculosis
Tuberculosis Mycobacterium can invade the blood vessels and arteries in the body. This is the reason why patients cough along with blood after contracting the disease.
This is known as Hemoptysis in medical literature. 

What is the difference between Primary and Secondary Tuberculosis
When the bacteria gets deposited in the lungs for the first time causing the enlargement of lymph nodes, it is known as Primary Tuberculosis. Secondary Tuberculosis occurs when the disease spreads to other parts of the lungs causing cavitation in the lungs. Secondary Tuberculosis could spread to other parts of the body as well. 

Are asthma and wheezing health issues linked to Tuberculosis
Yes, chronic cough could be a symptom related to either wheeze or Tuberculosis. Some patients get treatment for wheeze but in the event a chest x-ray, full blood count and other medical checkups are not conducted properly, it is difficult to identify whether the patient is actually suffering due to wheezing or Tuberculosis. 

What are the preventive methods available for Tuberculosis
Although BCG (Bacillus CalmetteGurin) vaccination is available from birth it is not hundred percent effective for everyone. BCG vaccination prevents Tuberculosis to a certain level because the efficacy of the treatment may wear off with time. Thats why children are less prone to get Tuberculosis compared to adults. Therefore, although BCG vaccinations are administered to the patient, it cannot be guaranteed that it would act as a proper preventive method against Tuberculosis in the long-term. 

What are the treatment options available to cure the disease
Tuberculosis is mainly a disease involving the lungs but it can spread to the brain, kidney, bone and other organs as well. As it is a systematic disease, treatment should be administered for six months in order to fully cure a patient in the event he or she contracts the disease. Four drugs will be administered during the first two months and two drugs will be given to the patient during the last four months.
If a brain or bone infection is involved, there could be a possibility of developing Meningitis in which case treatment will have to be administered to the patient for another nine to twelve months. Treatment should not be discontinued halfway, as it could result in the patient becoming drug resistant to the disease.
Multidrug-Resistant TB patients are prone to die since they are immune to the treatment generally given to ordinary TB patients. Although BCG (Bacillus CalmetteGurin) vaccination is available from birth it is not hundred percent effective on everyone. Therefore, although BCG vaccination is administered to the patient it cannot be guaranteed that it would act as a proper preventive method against Tuberculosis. However, it is important to keep in mind that Tuberculosis is a PREVENTABLE and TREATABLE disease and with amply raised awareness among the masses, the disease could be avoided or diagnosed early and treated successfully.
