A story behind a tender extension
	

A rumour making rounds in political circles says that a certain political high authority has turned over 70 duty-free shops at an airport into a veritable gold mine!

Tenders for these shops are awarded for a five-year period and the owners must face competitive bidding after the expiry of this five-year lease for the renewal of the tender.
When the tender renewal in respect of some duty-free shops fell due recently, a buddy of a high political authority had quietly met their owners and told them that he could arrange the tender extension of the shops involved for an unofficial payment of Rs.1 million in respect of each shop.
The shop owners concerned after being satisfied with the credibility factor, had considered the offer a godsend for it spared the hassle of going through the tender procedure again and agreed to the deal.
So, the money had changed hands unofficially and the shop owners had received an official document duly signed by the authorities concerned extending their tender for another five-year period, they say. The news about the duty-free shop tender extension reached the countrys highest political authority the very day the relevant official documents were inked. But none had questioned the roly-poly political authority about this deal so far, they say.

Britain says disappointed by SLs pace of change
	
The British Government on Friday said it was disappointed by the Sri Lankas pace of change in terms of fulfilling its international commitments and said there was much remaining to be done.
Mark Field, Minister of State for Asia and the Pacific told British Parliament on Friday that he met Foreign Minister Tilak Marapana in the margins of the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in London and discussed about the progress achieved by Sri Lanka.
I met Minister Marapana on April 18. We discussed the progress made by Sri Lanka against its international commitments. I set out the British Government's view that there is much remaining to be done and we have been disappointed by the pace of change, he said.
He said there was limited progress on Human Rights in Sri Lanka and Sri Lanka remained a Human Rights Priority Country for the British Government.
When Labour Party MP Catherine West asked what recent assessment State Minister Field had made of the human rights and security situation in Sri Lanka, he said the Sri Lankan Government called a State of Emergency in response to attacks on Muslim communities in February 2018.
We have encouraged the authorities to ensure that those responsible are investigated and held accountable, he said.
Meanwhile, he said Britain led a strong joint statement at the March UNHR Council calling on the Sri Lankan Government to redouble its efforts to deliver the commitments it made to the Council in 2015 and 2017. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Bus strike: SLTB ramps up service; leave cancelled
	
Leave entitlements of Transport Board drivers and conductors had been cancelled due to the scheduled countrywide bus strike, SLTB Chairman Ramal Siriwardana said.
He said the SLTB would assign to service during the countrywide private bus strike.
Mr Siriwardana also said that many SLTB buses would be assigned as the people had been inconvenienced due to the strike.
Buses would be assigned, not according to the current time table but as per requirement of passengers. The SLTB operates 6,100 buses but about 5,500 buses are operational. Rest of the buses are not assigned for transport service due to shortage of drivers, Siriwardana said.
Therefore, I have instructed and requested the depot officials to assign experienced drivers, who have obtained heavy vehicle driving license, and even employees in the mechanical, technical sections and those who in the service extension to take on the wheels, he said.
I have instructed all Provincial Depots to assign as many buses as possible, he said. (Chaturanga Samarawickrama)

China uses 'debtbook diplomacy' in 16 countries including SL: report
	
The Chinese government is leveraging billions of dollars in debts to gain political leverage with developing countries across Asia and the Pacific including Sri Lanka, CNN reported on Wednesday quoting a report.
The independent report, written by a pair of Harvard University scholars, has been presented to the US State Department.
It had identified 16 countries targeted by the Chinese government for "debtbook diplomacy, " with Pakistan, Djibouti and Sri Lanka identified as being most vulnerable.
According to the report, in some cases the huge debts grow to a size too large to pay back, allowing Beijing to leverage the loans to "acquire strategic assets or political influence over debtor nations."
This could allow the Chinese government to extend its influence across the Indian Ocean and the Pacific, encircling India and Australia as well as helping to consolidate its position in the South China Sea, the report said.
In 2017, the unprofitable Sri Lankan port built with billion-dollar loans from Beijing was leased to Chinese state-owned firms for 99 years to help repay the country's debts.
Last month, Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said he viewed "with great concern" any foreign military bases being built in the South Pacific, following reports Beijing was in talks with Vanuatu to host Chinese forces.
There is also concern in Washington that China is poised to gain control of a major commercial port in Djibouti, where the US and China have military bases.
A US State Department official told CNN Tuesday it encouraged China to promote and uphold internationally accepted best practices in infrastructure development and funding.

Controlling climate with Chinese Technology
	
Sri Lanka is looking for the possibility of controlling droughts and floods through controlling clouds using Chinese Technology, it was revealed yesterday.
This was revealed at the signing of agreement for projects under the World Bank aided Agriculture Sector Modernization programme in Colombo last evening.
The report on a study carried out by the experts attached to Chinese Academy of Meteorological Sciences was handed over to Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe by Minister of Primary Industries and Social Welfare Daya Gamage after signing of agreements last evening.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe stressed the need for modernizing Sri Lankas agricultural sector in order to make it a stable industry. Many countries such as USA and East Asian nations have modernized the agriculture industry though it had not been done in South Asia. Modernization of rural agriculture is essential as such a growth will help improve the rural economy. Rural economy development is essential for the countrys economic stability, the Prime Minister said.
Minister Daya Gamage said agriculture sector in Sri Lanka could contribute to countrys overall economic growth to a great extent if it is able to stop droughts and floods just like it is done in China. He said the experts from Chinese Academy of Meteorological Sciences had already carried out a study on clouds above Sri Lanka and findings will be made known soon.
Sri Lankas agriculture sector could be made more vibrant and diversified if it is modernized and disasters such as droughts and floods are avoided.  Sri Lanka could earn more export revenue from crops such as cinnamon and ginger than tea if such new industries are developed, the Minister said. (Yohan Perera)

Corrupt state officials  surviving at the top!
	
More foreign investors may be confrontedby corruption dilemma
The recent incident where President Maithripala Sirisenas Chief of Staff, Dr I.H.K. Mahanama and Chairman of the State Timber Corporation P. Dissanayake were arrested and remanded on the charges of soliciting a bribe of Rs. 20 million from an Indian investor, not only made headlines but has become the talking point within many sections of the society. The businessman, who had purchased a block of land at the Kantale Sugar Factory, had wanted to purchase machinery and building space to commence operating the factory.
Then, the suspects had allegedly solicited a bribe of Rs.540 million from the businessman promising that they would provide him with the approval needed to obtain the machinery and building space for the purpose. However, after negotiations were held between the two parties, it was said to have decided to reduce this bribe to Rs.100 million. The two officials were to receive a bribe of Rs. 100 million, but they were allegedly caught red-handed while accepting Rs. 20 million as an advance payment.  
The investor has said in a statement to the Bribery Commission that Dr. Mahanama again demanded US $ 3 million in May 2017. The payment was to be made at the car park of a restaurant in Wattala. On September 2017, State Timber Corporation Chairman P. Dissanayake also allegedly approached the investor and demanded a bribe during a meeting at a luxury hotel
The alleged incident can be viewed in two ways. One is that the Good Governance is plagued by bribery or corruption. The other is the question as to how these types of actions would adversely affect investors who wish to invest in Sri Lanka
A query also needs to be raised as to how these types of suspected unscrupulous state officials like Mahanama and Dissanayake managed to survive while serving in top administrative ranks.
Lets first start with the history of Mahanama allegedly attempting to take a bribe from the Kantale sugar investor.
Long history of attempted extortion
The proposal to recommence the operations at the Kantale Sugar Factory was first brought forward in 2006 during the Mahinda Rajapaksa regime. Subsequently, international bids were called for in 2010 to find a suitable investor for the project.
One of the most powerful secretaries under the Rajapaksa administration attempted to ensure that an investor, who was the third in the list, was suitable to receive the tender. The tender was given to him. Due to the controversy which transpired after details were exposed, the deal was shelved.
On February 14, 2015, a month after the Good Governance assumed power, the approval to recommence operations at the Kantale Sugar Factory was given. This was to be one of the first large scale Foreign Direct Investments under the administration. The selected investor received the green light by the Cabinet Committee on Economic Management (CCEM) and by the Cabinet on June 17, 2015. Accordingly, an agreement was signed between M G Sugars Lanka (Pvt) Ltd and the Board of Investment (BOI). One of the conditions of the agreement was that MG Sugar must deposit US $ 10 million with the Sri Lankan Government and on August 08, 2015 the company met the requirement.
However, the Ministry of Lands kept on delaying what was to be done on its part. It placed many hurdles to prevent the investment from taking place. Dr I.H.K. Mahanama, who was the then secretary to the Ministry of Lands, said to have informed the investor that he could prevent the delays from the AGs Department and that nothing could be done without his approval.
The Minister of Lands at that time was M. K. A. D. S. Gunawardana. He represented Trincomalee District and wanted to develop Kantale, which is a part of Trincomalee District. However, the Minister, who passed away on January 2016, was replaced by John Amaratunga, who had a lot on his plate. Taking advantage of the lack of interest on the part of the Minister, Dr. Mahanama has allegedly administrated the Ministry according tohis wishes.
He is said to have informed the investor that he needed US $ 3 million to ensure that the deal went through. However, at this point the investor had in fact deposited US $ 10 million with the Government.
The head of the BOI then was Upul Jayasuriya. He had said that although he approved investments, the Secretary to the Ministry of Lands, Dr. Mahanama and Secretary to the Ministry of Power, Suren Batagoda placed constant obstacles, which delayed the investments. After this revelation, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and Minister of Development Strategies and International Trade, Malik Samarawickrama made life difficult for Jayasuriya, which eventually led to his resignation.
The investor has said in a statement to the Bribery Commission that Dr. Mahanama again demanded US $ 3 million in May 2017. The payment was to be made at the car park of a restaurant in Wattala. According to the statement, on September 2017, State Timber Corporation Chairman P. Dissanayake also has allegedly approached the investor and demanded a bribe during a meeting at a luxury hotel. Between October 2017 and February 2018 Mahanama and Dissanayake had demanded a bribe from the investor on four separate occasions and threatened that they wouldnt allow the project to take place unless the bribe is paid (The meeting place was the chairmans office at State Timber Cooperation).
At this point Mahanama had allegedly threatened the investor that unless he received his bribe, he would retake the land earmarked for sugar cane planting. By this time, the investor had brought his British and South African partners to Sri Lanka.
Bribery Commission approached
Thinking that he had no other choice, the investor approached the Bribery Commission in February 2018. According to what has been revealed, Dr. Mahanama is said to have told the investor that he had to take a bribe because he would have no income after his retirement. Mahanama has claimed that he had planned to construct a building near the University of Kelaniya and rent it out.
Dissanayake, was also the Secretary to former President Chandrika Kumarakunga.
However, the irony was that the two men didnt know that the investor had already lodged a complaint with the Bribery Commission following the initial threats and accordingly, the Bribery Commission officials had been keeping an eye on this case for a while.
Speaking to the Daily Mirror, Executive Director of Centre for Human Rights (CHR) and Campaign for Free and Fair Elections (CaFFE) Keerthi Tennakoon, said that he had received information regarding this case in early 2016 and had exposed this on various occasions using the platform of Anti Corruption Front and the Centre for Human Rights.
CHR Executive Director Tennakoon said that this Indian national is a businessman who had been working in Sri Lanka since 1994 and was well connected.
Negative impacton investors
There is a negative impact on investors who wish to invest in Sri Lanka following the news of this incident. Tennakoon said that this incident is a huge blow on investors who are hoping to invest in Sri Lanka.
Now, investors would not think twice, but thrice before they arrive in Sri Lanka. They would show little interest to invest in Sri Lanka. It is not easy to restore credibility once lost. Hence, the Government should look into this matter seriously and not be hesitant to take effective steps to win the hearts of investors, Tennakoon opined.
He said that the Indian businessman is receiving deaths threats and he is not safe at this stage. Therefore, the BOI should take strict measure for his safety. 
Good name tarnished-Dr.Mahanamahewa
Meanwhile, Colombo University Law Faculty Senior Lecturer and Former Human Rights Commissioner Dr. Prathiba Mahanamahewa told Daily Mirror that this incident had tarnished the good name of the country.
This is an action of contravention. This act would have direct impact on the investors. Both the President and Prime Minister have kept Sri Lanka on false pedestal during their official visits to foreign countries and extended invitations to these officials to invest in Sri Lanka, showcasing the island as a peaceful country. But now according to what has transpired, the investors are in a two minds whether to come to Sri Lanka. This would vastly affect the countrys economy, Dr. Mahanamahewa warned.
When thinking about as to how these alleged state officials survived while serving in top ranks, it seems that the Government has been maintaining a zero-tolerance policy with regard to bribery cases. If the Government had carried out formal investigations against such alleged individuals, these types of wrongdoings would have been nipped in the bud, Dr. Mahanamahewa added.
He added that the setting up of High Courts would not be sufficient in order to solve cases like these and added that the Protection of Victims of Crime and Witnesses Act should be amended.
He further suggested that if bribery is to be eradicated from the society, the seeds for such a purpose should be strewn at the school level. He said that students must be educated regarding the gravity of a bribe.
Culprits associated with bribery cases should be blacklisted and exposed to the general public, he added.
Now, investors would not think twice, but thrice before they arrive in Sri Lanka. They would show little interest to invest in Sri Lanka.
Governments stance on the issue
Nobody likes to apply cinder on his or her face. It is certain that no one in the Government dares to criticize the incidents that occur within the regime. But lets see what the Governments stance on this is. 
Speaking to the Daily Mirror, Minister of Public Administration and Management and Law and Order Ranjith Madduma Bandara said that this is an incident which had showed that the law is applicable to anybody.
Unlike the previous regime, our Government is treating everyone equally irrespective of position and possession. The ambition of this Government is to form a country which is against bribery and corruption, Madduma Bandara said.
During the previous regime, if anybody went against the Rajapaksas, he or she was abducted or killed. No investigations were carried out against the alleged officials then. But, we have been able to conduct a transparent investigation into this recent incident and bring the wrongdoers to book, Minister Madduma Bandara affirmed.
Repeated complaints against Mahanama
The point to consider is how Mahanama became the Chief of Staff of the President when there were allegations levelled against him. A number of other organisations and I have repeatedly complained against Mahanama and raised concerns about his behaviour. However, despite all this, he was appointed as the Presidents Chief of Staff. I have also raised concerns about seven other state officials, but there have been no investigations against them. This makes the public desperate in watching the activities of the Government. These happenings can only benefit the Rajapaksas, Executive Director of Centre for Human Rights (CHR) and Campaign for Free and Fair Elections (CaFFE) Keerthi Tennakoon said.
We have been so democratic that we were able to bring even Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe to the Presidential Commission of Inquiry in connection with the alleged bond scam that took place in the Central Bank, the Minister added. These types of questionable actions cant be accepted. The culprits should be perpetrated under the law following a proper investigation. At the same time, the Government must be commended for taking the initiative to unearth these incidents and act independently, in a democratic manner. On the other hand, the Government should take remedial measures to prevent such incidents from happening again.

Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) would be on a countrywide 24-hour token strike tomorrow against the Free Trade Agreement (FTA) signed with Singapore and the proposed ETCA with India, GMOA Secretary Dr Haritha Aluthge said today.
He said, however, the emergency treatment units, maternity, children, cancer, nephrology and Army hospitals would function as usual despite the token strike.
He said the GMOA was forced to take this decision in the absence of a positive response from the authorities including President Maithripala Sirisena to their request. He also said the token strike would begin at 8.00 a.m. at all the Government Hospitals.
We have earlier written to President Sirisena informing this issue. We are still waiting for a response from him. The authorities should not enter into or implement such agreements in an arbitrary manner without setting up a National Policy on International Trade Agreements, he said.
He said the FTA recently signed with Singapore was detrimental to the country and it would create an open space for foreign countries to invade Sri Lanka's job market.
He said the FTA had not included a termination date and exit clause and such an agreement was disadvantageous to the country.
The authorities concerned had signed this FTA without presenting it to Parliament, he said.
Sri Lanka and India are to hold the next round of official level talks on the proposed ETCA from May 23. We are against it since it is also detrimental to the country, he said.
Meanwhile, GMOA Assistant Secretary Dr Naveen De Soyza said Subject Minister Malik Samarawickrama should be held responsible for this issue and added that he should immediately resign from his post or else he should be removed.
He said the GMOA membership had been informed to not to engage in private practices during the token strike. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)

Good word from wrong party was to their disadvantage
	

None of the Blue partys Diyawanna ones -- either the backbenchers or purohitas at state or deputy level -- got a promotion to top team status at the latest reshuffle of the pack. According to reports, there were several Blue ones who were eagerly looking forward to a kick upstairs and conspicuous among them were grey-haired and bearded senior from Colombo, Lucky from Mahiyanagana and the business tycoon from Negombo.

Those who had made inquiries about this matter had learnt that a suggestion made to him by the Green leader had led Number One to decide not to promote any of the Blue aspirants to top team status at the latest reshuffle.
The Green leader had suggested the names of some Blue ones as those deserving top team status and that had led Number One to come to his own conclusions. So, he had immediately decided not to promote any of the Blue party ones believed to have one foot in the Blue party and the other in the Green party!

Govt. on borrowing spree, says MR
	
Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa said today that the incumbent Government, having committed public funds to win elections, began the biggest borrowing spree in Sri Lankas history to meet the increased expenditure.
Issuing a statement, he said this Government had borrowed a total of around USD 19.5 billion in foreign commercial loans and well over six trillion in rupee loans from January 2015 to date.
He said following the recent increase in fuel prices, transport costs and the prices of goods and services had started rising.
The statement said:
Fishermen are up in arms against the sudden increase in the price of kerosene by more than double the earlier price and the creation of a coupon system to distribute subsidized kerosene. In the midst of the agitation and unrest resulting from this fuel price increase, members of the government have been trying to justify it by saying that fuel costs were higher during the Rajapaksa Government. Today the price of a barrel of crude oil is around 70 USD. When I assumed office as President back in November 2005, it was around USD 73. It reached the highest point of USD 160 in June 2008 and even as late as August 2014, the price was over USD 103. It was only in the last three months of 2014 that oil prices started declining and by the time the Government changed in January 2015, it had gone down to USD 51 per barrel.
From that point onwards, oil prices remained at a low level for three years. The prices kept declining and reached a low of USD 33 by February 2016. Thereafter oil prices increased slowly but even as late as October 2017, it was less than USD 55. It is only in the last few months that oil prices have steadily risen to reach the present level of USD 70. During the nine full years in which I ruled the country, we never had the benefit of low oil prices.
The present price of USD 70 per barrel is quite low compared to the average price of crude oil during my government. Despite the highest global crude oil prices in history during those years, we not only won the war against terrorism which many people thought was unwinnable but also successfully concluded the biggest infrastructure building programme ever seen in this country since the colonial era. We were able to do all that while maintaining the fertilizer subsidy so as to shield farmers from the increasing prices of fertilizer. Despite high oil prices, my government was able to maintain the highest growth rates in Sri Lankas history and the per capita GDP increased threefold during my tenure in power.
The Yahapalana Government has had the benefit of very low crude oil prices and savings totalling more than USD five billion were made in foreign exchange over the past three years. Yet the economy has been in steady decline and development work ceased completely during that period. Last Saturday, the present finance minister said that if he had been holding that position in January 2015, he would not have given concessions to win applause from the gallery.
Thereafter a UNP backbencher echoed much the same views. The reference made by the minister to concessions given to win applause from the gallery was probably to the Rs.10,000 allowance for government servants and the reduction in the prices of fuel, gas and certain foodstuffs that were made by this government soon after winning the presidential election. All these were in fact pledges given in Maithripala Sirisenas presidential election manifesto to win votes, he said.

Hardcore 7 waiting for opportune moment
	

The sensational news in the recent past that a 20-member rebel group in the Green party was poised for a do-or-die battle to bring about a radical change in the party hierarchy kept even the party members and sympathizers at the grassroots level on their toes. In fact, it was welcome news for them for they were eagerly looking forward to a revival of the party with the old set giving way to new young blood.

However, the party leader soft-pedalled the main demand after making some patchwork changes and embarked as usual on a policy of appeasement and procrastination.
Meanwhile, the rebels began moving away from the group one by one grabbing whatever carrot held out to them by the leadership. And it has come to light now that the original 20 has now come down to 7. However, this hardcore 7 are getting the backing of a powerful section of seniors from behind the scene and they are set to raise their war cry come the announcement of the next big poll, they say.

When he started talking tough on the eve of the failed no-confidence motion, some people openly wondered whether he too was among the young rebels set to send their leader to the political wilderness.
Meanwhile, a rumour gone viral in party circles says that the young members aggressive conduct is sheer posturing aimed at gaining some position in the party  possibly in the Yoyun Peramuna and the cue has not been lost on the party leadership.

The Green one from Puttalam going for the jugular of the Green leader was taking swipes at him almost daily for some time and he suddenly went abroad on the eve of the no-confidence motion.

The politico went into the silent mode following his return from abroad and a rumour said that the man had been promised a place in the top team in the reshuffle around the corner.
The reshuffle came, but the politico got only a state level one as before. The only consolation was it was a different subject. And there was no need to work with a purohita
he hated.
Up in arms again, the politico had reportedly invited the young green ones in the backbenches to the battle-front.
But the young Green ones have refused to heed his call saying that they could not trust him any longer. So, the Puttalam politico has been compelled to fight his battle alone, they say.

By the way, some predictions she had made about certain political leaders in the country recently had angered some people and they had abused and threatened her on several occasions. She had also incurred the wrath of a leading politico in Rajarata, they say.
Some political and other high-ups had offered the maani their help to pursue legal action against the culprits. But she had declined their offers saying that the deities would punish all those responsible for the crime committed.

Hold elections to 3 PCs: Rohitha challenges govt.
	
Former minister and MP Rohitha Abeygunawardena yesterday challenged the Government to hold elections to three Provincial Councils, Sabaragamuwa, North-Central and Eastern in the same month.
Addressing a news briefing, he said although the government had promised on numerous occasions that it would hold the elections to the three PCs, it had been unable to do so due to the instability of the government.
If the UNP and SLFP intend to contest the PC polls together they are welcome to do so. But, we know for sure that whichever party or amalgamation of parties put their names forward for the PC polls, the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna headed by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa will win at the election convincingly, Abeygunawardena said.
Meanwhile, he said people were confronted with a lot of issues due to the hike in fuel prices.
The prices of goods like fish, short eats, and tea would go up soon. This situation is a result of the poor economic management of the government, Abeygunawardena said, adding that this government has been the most unsuccessful government in the history of politics. (Sheain Fernandopulle)

The State Counsel informed Court that AGs recent opinion was to use the Fire Arm Ordinance in the case according to the current investigation.
Accordingly, Mount Lavinia Additional Magistrate Lochana Abeywickrama rejected the bail application and ordered to be further remanded the suspect until May 30.
The Magistrate also ordered the Army Commander to provide the necessary documents by considering the initial requests that were made by the CID related to the investigations of the case.
The eighth suspect, Karunasekara was arrested on April 5 by the CID in connection with the abduction and assault of Journalist Keith Noyahr in 2008. He was the Director of Military Intelligence at the time of the incident.
The CID had arrested eight suspects earlier along with Major Bulathwatte of the Military Intelligence Corps in connection with the same case.(Yoshitha Perera)

## Title: Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation

Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation
	
The strength of a nation derives from the integrity of the home.
- Confucius
In the fifth installment of the Hollywood Blockbuster sequel Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation, agent Ethen Hunt, played by Tom Cruise, overcomes all odds, pulling out miraculous and daring feats to accomplish his mission which initially appears impossible. The scene is set, not in Hollywood but in this neck of the woods called Sri Lanka, where a Rogue Nation has been created. Yes, the nation that once prided itself on its 2,500 years of pristine Buddhism, its humane and kind people and tolerant attitudes; when compared to most of its neighbours is an ideal backdrop for the next instalment of Mission Impossible. 
All are patriots in this country, if jingoistic rhetoric is the yardstick then we are the most patriotic nation in the world
	Contrary to popular thought, corruption, dishonesty and thievery are not things that are confined to this or that segment of society
	We are not humble enough to admit where we falter or fall short. Face it, self criticism is not ourstrong point
In common parlance a Rogue Nation refers to a state that does not respect other nations or causes a threat to the collective good of the international community. But what about a State where roguishness is the norm from top to bottom or a state full of rogues
All across the society
Somehow we have come to this, a Rogue Nation! Interpol must be opening a new desk to act on red, blue and what not, notices that are being issued on Sri Lankans. The FCID, PCoI, PRECIFAC and Special High Courts for financial crimes have become the order of the day to tackle the magnitude of corruption and thievery that has permeated each and every layer of society. Contrary to popular thought, corruption, dishonesty and thievery are not things that are confined to this or that segment of society. It is rampant from top to bottom; leaders, professionals, law enforcers, priests, public officials, businessmen and the common people are all happy partakers of this putrid culture. From admitting children to schools, getting driving licences to MIG deals and bond scams! 
The COPE report is testimony to the malpractices, corruption, plundering and thievery that go on in public and semi public institutions having a direct bearing on the economy. A list of cases in a Magistrates Court in any given jurisdiction will show how widespread and rampant thievery, illegal businesses, stealing and other vices are. 
Big Sharks andsmall fry
The ordinary people who lament that only small fry get caught in the net of the law while sharks and whales roam free, themselves engage in bribing, fraud and thievery in their petty little ways. On the other hand those powerful and mighty, who stand accused of frauds of astronomical magnitude, draft laws to create special courts to deal with thievery. A typical case of Dracula in charge of the blood bank, isnt it 
The law enforcement has two gears in its operating mechanism; first and the overdrive. When a school student steals five coconuts to pay school fees or the court peon takes a 5,000-rupee bribe for some thing, the machinery moves on overdrive; arresting, producing, punishing in a swiftness and speed reminiscent of Hussein Bolt. Yet when it comes to those cases involving billions of dollars and individuals of the top echelons of the power structure, it is a totally different story. 
When one says that people are left with a choice between the pot and the kettle, both of which are black, obviously, in terms of electing leaders to govern them, you are overlooking something. It is not only the pot and the kettle that are black with corrupt soot. The populace, themselves, are second to none in this game; they are veterans of dishonesty and underhand deals. Leave your mobile phone on the bus seat, walk to the front door, turn back and see if it is still there.
Not only is it not, but the sim also would have been removed in a matter of seconds. Give your car for repairs to a garage and then get an expert to check the parts to see whether the original parts have been replaced with duplicates. Bury your dead with some jewellery that the deceased loved in her lifetime or in a costly coffin, come back the next morning, dig the grave to find the body remains without the coffin, relieved of the jewellery. Yes, folks, even the dead are desecrated for money in this land of 2,500 years of pristine culture. 
Lack of self criticism
We are not humble enough to admit where we falter or fall short. Face it, self criticism is not our strong point. Look at Germany and Japan and the atrocious circumstances they underwent during the Second World War scenario. But look at them today, leaders in their own right, beacons for other nations not only in terms of political stability and economic might, but also in terms of discipline, integrity and civility. We talk about emulating Singapore, but refuse to have fingerprinting machines to mark attendance in our work places, specially the public sector. 
All are patriots in this country, if jingoistic rhetoric is the yardstick then we are the most patriotic nation in the world. But when it comes to day to day action, of doing our duty, going the extra mile for the country, paying our taxes, preserving our environment, not resorting to corrupt and dishonest practices, we fall way short of the mark. We fail to see that a rogue or a scoundrel could never be a patriot. Anyone who pilfers national coffers or evades taxes or seeks kick backs from national projects will never be a patriot. 
The soil of this land is no longer fertile, it is poisonous; the waterways which are the veins of this land are polluted beyond recognition; the entire upcountry is at the risk of being swept away in landslides. Most of these catastrophes have been brought about as a result of greed, the lure of filthy lucre, by overlooking proper procedures, ignoring warnings and skipping proper methodology for financial benefit. 
In the Corruption Index published by Amnesty International, Sri Lanka is ranked 91 from among 175 countries showing where we stand in terms of corruption. Yet if I were to give examples to prove that we are a rogue nation, the Features Editor, would have to provide me his valuable space from the first page to the last. Suffice it to say it is endless. Political leadership is not capable of cleansing our land from this filth as they themselves are the origin of this putrid mess. 
On the brink
I had finished this article when it was reported that the Golden Peacock award received by veteran film-maker Dr. Lester James Peiris had been robbed by one of the mourners who attended the funeral. Later it was revealed that those responsible was an organized gang which frequented high profile funerals and other occasions where people gather and carried out these blatant and shameless acts of thievery. 
The location for the next sequel of Mission Impossible is right here. It is Sri Lanka. Yet it is doubtful whether even a daredevil like Ethan Hunt will be able to rid this nation of its roguishness. Even he is bound to fail in cleansing this rogue nation. 
We are on the verge of doomsday; we are at the brink yet little realize it. 
It is Mission Impossible, folks! We are a rogue nation.

No bus strike: 12.5% hike accepted; Min fare Rs.12
	
Following the discussions with Transport Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva this evening, the All Ceylon Private Bus Association (ACPBA) decided to cancel its scheduled strike, which was scheduled to start midnight today.

However, a meeting with the Transport Deputy Minister Asoka Abeysinghe failed. During the meeting, the Minister had requested the bus associations to wait until next Tuesday (22) for a final decision.
The bus associations and the IPPBA said that they would not to wait.
Waiting for Ministers decision till Tuesday is not reasonable and we should get the final decision today to change the decision of tonights strike, Mr Priyanjith said then.

No more hike possible: Min. Rajitha
	
The National Transport Commission (NTC) had granted the maximum possible bus fare increase to private bus operators on an accepted Government policy and therefore, the NTC was not in a position to give further increase to private bus operators, Cabinet Spokesman, Health Minister Dr Rajitha Senaratne said today.
He said that the Transport Ministry would strengthen the SLTB bus fleet by additional 1,500 buses with effect from tomorrow morning in addition to increasing the number of train services to face a bus strike if private bus operators went ahead with the scheduled trade union action.
Meanwhile, Deputy Transport and Civil Aviation Minister Ashok Abeysinghes offer to increase bus fare by 12% was rejected by the three trade unions of private bus operators, who discussed the issue with him last afternoon.
Deputy Minister Abeysinghe said another discussion had been scheduled late last afternoon with the Private Bus Operators Union, All Island Private Bus Company Federation and the Inter-Provincial Bus Company Federation.
I offered a 12% bus fare increase of bus fares with the consent of President Maithripala Sirisena effective from next Tuesday (22) to private bus operators but they wanted more and said they need the bus fare increase immediately and if not, go ahead with the trade union action from tonight, he added.
Meanwhile, the SLTB today cancelled leave of all employees until further notice and retired engine drivers and bus drivers have also been called for duty. (Sandun A Jayasekera)

Operating from home after portfolio swap
	

It is well known that several politicos who had their portfolios changed at the latest reshuffle are not happy with their present portfolios.

One of them is said to be a senior Green member hailing from a famous vegetable-growing area.
Earlier this worthy oversaw a subject which he really enjoyed.
He is said to have been planning to provide a good number of jobs to his supporters in this sector when the reshuffle came and pushed him into a different subject.
Highly disappointed with this portfolio change that had come for the second time within a matter of one month, the senior Green member had called on the leader and appealed to him to reconsider giving back to him the much-coveted subject. However, he had been told it was too late to do the proposed switch-back. The politico had found it difficult to resign himself to the new situation and had gone back to his ancestral home without assuming duties in his new Ministry.
He is said to be now discharging the powers and functions of his new Ministry from home.

People will love new bridge to Crimea: Putin
	

REUTERS, 15th MAY, 2018- Russian President Vladimir Putin, driving a truck, unveiled the auto section of a new road-and-rail bridge linking Russia to the annexed Crimean peninsula on Tuesday, defying Ukraine which said the move showed cynical disregard for international law.
Putin, at the wheel of a heavy KAMAZ truck, drove the full 19 km (12 miles) across the bridge from the Kerch Strait, which some Russians call Putins bridge and which is designed to link Crimea into Russias transport network.
At a ceremony broadcast live on state TV, Putin, dressed in blue jeans, was met by cheering workers on the Crimean side after driving the orange-coloured truck across the bridge in a small convoy of vehicles.
At last, thanks to your talent this project, this miracle has happened, Putin told the crowd of workers.
In Kiev, Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko said: The illegal construction of the Kerch bridge is the latest evidence of the Kremlins disregard for international law.
It is particularly cynical that its opening is happening on the eve of the latest anniversary of the deportation of the Crimean-Tatar people by the Stalin regime.
Russia annexed Crimea from neighbouring Ukraine in 2014, drawing sanctions and prompting a sharp deterioration in ties with the West. But many in Russia saw the move as restoring Moscows rule over a historically Russian region.
Built at a cost of 223 billion roubles ($3.60 billion), the bridge is set to be the longest dual-purpose span in Europe.

Private Bus Association firm on strike
	
The All Ceylon Private Bus Association (ACPBA) would go for an indefinite countrywide strike from midnight today if the Government did not agree on the minimum increment of Rs.15 and 15 per cent increment, ACPBA Secretary Anjana Priyanjith said.
Speaking at a media briefing at Narahenpita, he said they would not stop the strike until the Government re-considered increasing the minimum fare which was at Rs.10 to Rs.15.
The owners of buses that ply short distance get a gross loss of Rs.700 daily. The minimum bus fare increment is directly affecting them. Without increasing the minimum bus fare the strike cannot be stopped. The recent diesel fuel increment of Rs.14 per litre had affected them the most, he said.
The most powerful section of this bus strike will be held by short distance bus owners. Not giving the minimum bus fare demanded or not giving the increment more than 10 percent will not help to call the strike off.
A survey we did found that passengers are willing to pay an increased bus fare. However, they in turn want us to ensure that buses run on schedule. The objections are coming from the Transport Ministers, Mr Priyanjith said.
The transport Minister and Deputy Minister called us for discussions which are not worth if the final decision should be taken by President Maithripala Sirisena.
If the President called for discussions we will definitely go but not with useless Ministers, he said.
The Inter-Provincial Private Bus Association (IPPBA) President Sarath Vijitha Kumara said a certain bus association was trying to betray the bus strike by accepting the 10 percent bus fare hike given by the transport Deputy Minister Asoka Abeysinghe.
The said bus association claims the strikers demand of 20 percent hike was false.
Mr. Kumara said they requested a bus fare hike according to their cost. According to the National Policy there should be more than 20 percent annual bus fare increment.
Meanwhile, the All Ceylon Private Omnibus Owners Federation (ACPOOF) Stanly Fernando said the scheduled strike would be avoidable and only the President could interfere in the situation as he had previously done.
He also said the Government should be held responsible for the inconvenience caused to passengers. (Chaturanga Samarawickrama)

Right of reply - Rotarian replies to Muttukumaru
	
A Rotarian replies to Muttukumarus remarks on Rotary Leaders in the Daily Mirror of 27th April 2018
I am John Baskaran, a resident of Kandy and a Rotary member for over 15 years. Muttukumaru is no stranger to me. I am one of the few people who has previously taken him on. I respond to his article on Friday 27th April prominently featured in this newspaper. Muttukumaru, as he admits himself, was a former member of the Rotary Club of Colombo and was sacked from his club. Thus anything he says is biased.
In his tirade against Rotary, he has sent over 15,000 mails all over the world in an eight to ten year period.
His mails were mostly but not exclusively about two senior Rotary Club members K. R. Ravindran and Tissa Bandaranayake, to whom he has again referred to in the above article.
He attempts to thinly veil his attack on these two by not mentioning their names, although there is little doubt as to their identity.
Mr. Ravindran is a well-known business personality and has served as global President of Rotary International- the first Sri Lankan and one of a handful of Asians to do so. He has met and been received by world leaders, His Holiness the Pope and the Secretary General of UN.
Mr. Tissa Bandaranayake is a reputed chartered accountant who has been inducted into the Hall of Fame of his professional Institute and is a former member of the Rotary International Finance Committee.
Both these persons have brought laurels to their profession, industry and country.
Let me now respond to the several specific falsehoods, half-truths, distortions, innuendos and malice about us in his article.
I have documents to support every word I state below:
The integrity issue he writes of refers to his objection to one advertisement from a Casino that was published in a fund-raising souvenir for an International Rotary event hosted in Sri Lanka in 2005 with over 700 overseas guests, including its top brass. Out of the total cost of nearly Rs. 9 m in organizing this major event with 99% of the visitors from overseas, the value of the one advertisement he referred to was Rs. 300,000. None of the learned International leadership present at the event found anything wrong with the advertisement, except Muttukumaru.
His own Club President, the head of Rotary in Sri Lanka (the District Governor) and finally the World Headquarters itself confirmed to him and attempted to educate him that it was neither unethical nor immoral to accept an advertisement from a legal entity operating in this country as contended, even if it were a casino. They pointed out that in fact Rotary Conventions had been held in Las Vegas.
However, Muttukumaru continued to allege in thousands of mails sent around the world that the Chairman of the organizing committee, who was K. R. Ravindran should be personally held responsible and therefore deemed him a person of questionable character, unfit to be in Rotary.
nMuttukumaru, after due process was sacked from his own Rotary Club by his own colleagues and not by RI (Rotary International) as he states.
Separately he continued to circulate a multitude of mails about the professional work and standing of Mr. Bandaranayake and broadcasted that he was no longer a member of the Finance Committee of RI apparently because of his writings. He insinuated that Mr. Bandaranayake had been removed. This was utterly false for Mr. Bandaranayake did complete his full three-year term on the committee.
Both, Messrs Ravindran and Bandaranayake, independently filed legal action on Muttukumaru to protect themselves from the thousands of mendacious and defamatory mails being circulated by him, to randomly selected Rotary members, their bankers and business associates and others, in Sri Lanka and all over the world. The legal action they instituted, according to Muttukumaru in this article is an abuse of the legal system!
He writes of a court settlement with identical undertakings by both parties. He undertook in court to stop writing such mails about the organization and/or the petitioner and the petitioners readily agreed to reciprocate because they were not in any case in the habit of sending out unsolicited mails, had never done so, and had no intentions of doing so!! They would happily give such undertakings to not only court but to God and country and anyone else who cared to ask, at any time!
	Muttukumaru defaulted on that solemn undertaking given in court with another email campaign against Rotarys much-vaunted schools project of which Ravindran was Chairman. He wrote to Rotarians of the world and to all the overseas funders of the project claiming financial wrongdoings.
	Contrary to Muttukumarus assertions Rotarys flagship tsunami-related schools project received national and worldwide acclaim and has been featured as a model project in many forums including the international conventions. The project sent back to newly built schools across the country, with over 12,000 children and cost over Rs 1B to complete.
Although Muttukumaru had zero knowledge of the project and without a shred of evidence to support his claims, he made and continues to make in the said article, completely unsubstantiated allegations of financial irregularities.
No wonder then that as a result an irate Rotary public moved a formal motion which was unanimously supported and adopted at a gathering of Sri Lanka Rotary at the Galadari on May 2010, where 600 members present resolved and affirmed to unreservedly and unequivocally admonish and censure him and that he not be allowed to set foot into any Rotary Club in the country, the first time such a serious resolution was passed by a full body against an individual Rotarian anywhere in the world!
Notwithstanding Muttukumarus assault on him, Mr. Ravindran was subsequently nominated first as a Board Director and then as the global President of Rotary International and was based in Chicago. Muttukumaru, of course, continued to mass circulate mails. His mailing list even included members of the Swedish Parliament, the Charity Navigator, the Pulitzer Prize Board, the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, Power Reporting Co and such others.
	Consequently a contempt of court petition was filed against Muttukumaru.
	The decision of the court as borne out by the prominent headlines of your sister paper The Sunday Times of No. 8th, 2015 not only necessitated him tendering an apology to the petitioners in court but also agreeing to pay Rs. 10,000 to a charity picked by the petitioner, which Muttukumaru conveniently omitted to state in his article.
	In the said article he states as follows: (Mr. Ravindran) was even appointed special ambassador to attract foreign investment by RW (the Prime Minister) I do not wish to speculate on how much of FDI came in due to his efforts.
He maliciously does not care to report that Mr. Ravindran never did accept that appointment nor the other important appointments offered to him by the Government.
Subsequently HE the President conferred on Mr. Ravindran the title of Sri Lanka Sighamani Jewel of Sri Lanka.

RTI, PEOPLES POWER AND INDEPENDENT OVERSIGHT
	
The idea of independent oversight bodies to remedy the ugly party politicization of State institutions was first mooted by the 17th Amendment to the Constitution. It was a partially successful experiment as politicians refused to let go of power and the President at the time, Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga even refused to appoint a nominee of the Constitutional Council as the Chairman of the Elections Commission as she disagreed withthe nomination. 
Under the Rajapaksa presidency the 18th Amendment did away even with those marginal successes. But now, we see important gains for the people as the necessary element of impartiality is brought into decision-making that directly affects the rights of citizens. Three years after a new government and a new president assumed office in Sri Lanka, most of the independent commissions are functioning strongly just as they ought to. 
Last week, a global conference on Right to Information concluded with plaudits for the Right to Information Commission of Sri Lanka commending the past one year of impressive achievements. This was despite obstacles including the lack of funds for the Commission and delays posed by government entities not in favour of RTI for obvious reasons. 
As editorially noted in our sister paper, the Sunday Times last week, the RTI Commission is doing its work splendidly, delivering on the intentions of the law to the ordinary men and women of this country in search of otherwise elusive official information. An interesting aspect of its functioning is its people-friendly and informal proceedings, despite lawyers appearing before it. That is important as ordinary people should not be frightened to appear before such bodies that are meant to hold the scales in a way that corrects the imbalance between a powerful State and a powerless individual. 
The Commissions many rulings, against State institutions including the Office of the President, the Sri Lanka Police, the Army, the Telecommunications Regulatory Commission and a host of other government ministries, have been complied with up to now indicating that the Commission has taken pains to be just and fair in its conclusions. 
However, the Government must not act in a way that it gives with one hand and takes back with the other. The fact that the Audit Bill now before Parliament proposes to make some officials immune to RTI requests was not generally known till recently. This is not a positive development. Earlier, the Office of Missing Persons Act also had a similar clause. The Government must rethink these clauses and refrain from bringing in laws that chip away at the RTI concept. 
Meanwhile, the older Sri Lanka Human Rights Commission has been vocally proactive in addressing issues of human rights violations. It has called upon the Government to be mindful of human rights obligations when drafting laws, it has courageously made its position felt in respect of matters as controversial as the death penalty and is now engaging in an inquiry in respect of recent violent incidents against Muslim citizens in the Kandy District. The Bribery and Corruption Commission is spearheading comprehensive law reforms and has conducted successful sting operations against high State officials including the Presidents Chief of Staff and a former Head of the State Timber Corporation, rejuvenating a law which had earlier been used only against sprats. The Elections Commission has also performed creditably in recent elections. 
However, while these gains are acknowledged, the National Unity Government must act swiftly and in one collective voice to address bread and butter issues and provide relief measures to those struggling for survival. It must communicate better with the electorate. Consistency in policy is also important. Confusion continues to be seen in regard to implementation of the recent tax reforms. This must be avoided. 
Otherwise, the achievements that we see, can all be swept away in a bitter tsunami of anger at the next elections. That would be indeed a pity.

Serbia, Sri Lanka stand great potential for cooperation
	
First Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister of Serbia Ivica Dacic, who had paid a visit to Sri Lanka early this month, speaks about the latest initiative to revive historic relations between his country and Sri Lanka dating back to the days of the summit of the non-aligned movement. Serbia, a country that faced with separatism, shares common experience with Sri Lanka. He says Serbia can serve itself as the gateway to Europe. Formerly, Serbia was the political and cultural hub of Yugoslavia. Serbia has an ambitious goal of joining the European Union by 2020. The excerpts of the interview:
Maintain brotherly and friendly relations with Sri Lanka
	Invites PM, FAM to visit Serbia
	Europe is also undergoing changes
	Serbia proposes scholarships for Sri Lanka
	Serbia hopes European Union would survive
Q What is the outcome of your interactions with the Sri Lankan leaders during your visit between May 6 and 8
This was a visit of historic importance. This was the first such visit after 21 years. Yugoslavia and Sri Lanka used to be friendly countries in the past, dating back to the movement of non-aligned countries. Yugoslavian Prime Minister Marshal Josip Broz Tito paid a visit to this country twice. He was part of the non-aligned summit in Colombo. We are very friendly and brotherly nations. However, there were no high level visits since then. That is why this visit is very important. That is in order to reset our relations, to develop ties in various areas, to consult each other, to support each other at international level etc.
I propose scholarships for your country. I invited your Prime Minister and the Foreign Affairs Minister to visit Serbia. I would like our business communities to meet regularly and co-operate in the areas to be identified. 
Serbia is ready to co-operate with Sri Lanka on the issues important to it. That is why it is important to have consultations so that both sides are informed and kept abreast of major developments. Then, people can help each other
Q What are the potential areas for economic co-operation between the two countries
I cannot tell you precisely. It is up for the Business community to identify those areas. It is important for us, the politicians to create necessary preconditions. Business people can take advantage of that. That is the gateway to Europe and Asia. Serbia has Free Trade Agreements with European Union, Russia and Turkey. What is produced in Serbia can be exported to these countries without custom tariff. Also, Sri Lanka has good agreements and relations with Asian countries. Our business community can take advantage of that as well. Economic cooperation is rather small so far. Last year, it was only US $ 4 million. It is very low. But, we have great potential. 
Q Actually, what else can Serbia offer to the Sri Lankan business community
Anyone can find an area of interest. I can give you an example. A Nepali businessman opened a factory in Serbia to manufacture noodles. He is exporting his product to 40 countries without custom tariff. These are the advantages offered only by Serbia in Europe. You can export to many countries. I can also point out agriculture, energy sector, pharmaceuticals, and tourism.
Q How big is the Serbian middle-class which is interested in travelling overseas
A large number of Serbians visit this part of the world. We also have a lot of people visiting us (Serbia). We abolished visas for Chinese, Indian, and Indonesian nationals. We will apply the same on Sri Lanka. 
Q How can Serbia and Sri Lanka co-operate with each other in the international forum
In the area of politics, we consult each other on the issues that are important to our two countries. For Serbia, it is the defence of its territorial integrity. We had the case of separatism, secession around the part of Kosovo. It has been brought about by a unilateral Act. We have one national minority bent on carving out a state for them without prior agreement from the state they live in. This is very bad precedent. The best example can be found in Spain where the similar problem is found in the province of Catalonia. We are thankful to Sri Lanka for its continuous support to Serbia. Sri Lanka also has movements with separatist tendencies. We were told by the Prime Minister and the Foreign Affairs Minister that Sri Lanka would maintain its consistent policy on the territorial integrity of Serbia that it is not going to recognize Kosovo. 
Serbia is ready to co-operate with Sri Lanka on the issues important to it. That is why it is important to have consultations so that both sides are informed and kept abreast of major developments. Then, people can help each other. 
Q Sri Lanka successfully fought a war against separatism. Now, in the post war context, it is facing charges before the UNHRC. What is Serbias advice to Sri Lanka at this moment
Unfortunately, many of these charges are issues of politicization. And the application of double-standard is there. Some western countries are fighting terrorism themselves. Then, anything is permitted. Serbia also faced similar charges. There were tribunals established. We can always expect that these matters will be politicized. There will be some false allegations. It is important that terrorism has been defeated.
Q Serbia is trying to be a member of European Union. At the same time, there is a wave of nationalism in Europe. Britain has already taken initiatives to quit European Union. How do you view the regional integration
Europe is also undergoing changes. We hope European Union is going to survive. It is in our interest to become a member of European Union even though it is not sincere and truthful to us. It is in the interest of all the countries in the region to join European Union. We hope the nationalist tendencies are going to subside. 
Q What do you think about the multi-polar world order rising today
Here, it is important to talk about the balance of power. 
Q Today, China and Russia are rising and world powers to counter the dominion of the USA. What are your views on this trend
It is good to have more power centres in the world. There should also be strong multilateral organizations like the UN. There is principle equality among all the states in the world. 
Europe is also undergoing changes. We hope European Union is going to survive. It is in our interest to become a member of European Union even though it is not sincere and truthful to us. It is in the interest of all the countries in the region to join European Union
Q In Serbia you have a coalition government. In Sri Lanka too it is the similar trend. How do you parallel between the two
May be, you are not used to this in your country. In Europe, it is common. There are many coalition governments. Very often, there appears to be problems. We also have a coalition in Serbia. It is in fact a result of agreement concerning political goals. It is not something concerning the arithmetic of MPs. That is why we have political stability in the country. Political stability is the precondition for prosperity of any country. I think it is very important in the case of Sri Lanka.

## Title: Shift of global economic dominance towards Asia SL should seize the opportunity

Shift of global economic dominance towards Asia SL should seize the opportunity
	
Sri Lanka should seize the window of opportunity to make the country a developed nation when the world economic dominance shifts from the western hemisphere towards the Asian region by the year 2030, former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa said. 
Mr. Rajapaksa expressed these views at the Annual Convention of Viyath Maga Organisation held in Colombo on Sunday under the theme of An Intellectually Inspired Sri Lanka.
Prof. Rohan Gunaratne, Vidya Jyothi Dr. Bandula Wijeratne, Dr. Nalaka Godahewa, Mano Sekaram, Dr. Ismath Ramzy and Eranda Ginige spoke at the convention on various scopes of economic and social development of Sri Lanka.
Gotabhaya Rajapaksa, who is also the Chairman of the Viyath Maga, said Sri Lankan professionals, researchers, innovators and entrepreneurs should brace themselves to face the shift of the world economic dominance towards Asia.
By the year 2030, Chinas economy would expand and become twice the size of the economy of the US bytaking over worlds economy and leaving the US at second place. Indias economy will become the third largest followed by Japan and Indonesia. The nerve centre of worlds economy would be the Asian Region. We, the Sri Lankans, cannot seize the opportunity to develop the country, if we are not ready by the year 2030. The economic development is key to a countrys overall development. Its the very first solution to everything. In order to achieve sustainable economic growth, effective economic reforms should be made, he said. 
Economic development is key to a countrys overall development. Its the very first solution to everything. In order to achieve sustainable economic growth, effective economic reforms should be made
Prof. Rohan Gunaratne spoke under the theme Sri Lankas Geo-Politics and National Security 2030, said Sri Lanka could have played a neutral role in Geo-politics similar to Geneva in Switzerland without tilting towards one powerhouse. We could be the Geneva in Asia. Why not Sri Lanka become a neutral state where all powerhouses can work with Sri Lanka he quipped. 
He said many of the headquarters in the UN are pulling out from the US mainland and relocating themselves in the African Region. A move, he said, makes more sense since most of the UN missions and projects are being implemented in African countries.
It would be a great move for us to offer a plot of land in Sri Lanka to relocate one of the UN headquarters in here, he said. 
Commenting on the Sri Lankas economic development in the 1950s, 60s and 70s, Prof. Gunaratne said the country was better than even Japan, Korea, Singapore and Taiwan. However, this economic stability could not be maintained owing to Geo-political blunders we made as a country, he said. 
Meanwhile, he said though Sri Lanka defeated terrorism, it faces yet another challenge from extremism. 
Rohan Gunaratna is a Professor of Security Studies at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies at Nanyang Technology University and Head of International Centre for Political Violence and Terrorism Research, Singapore.
Ambassador, Science and Innovation for Sri Lanka, Professor of Clinical Medicine Kotalawela Defence University and CEO of LeoMed LLC and BinLab, Inc. Texas, US, Vidya Jyothi Dr. Bandula Wijeratne addressed the gathering about the Ingredients for an Innovative Economy.
Dr. Wijeratne said teamwork was key to innovation and research but Sri Lankans lack teamwork. Innovation comes through exchange of ideas and by working together. However, we dont have a support system for teamwork concept and promotes individuality. Current education system discourages teamwork which should be taught from kindergarten, he said. 
The mindset of innovation should be taught to students when they are still in the grade school and not after they graduate the university, he said. 
Imagine, what would have happened if Kumar Sangakkara or any other star cricketers practiced cricket once they graduate from the school or university. They have done it through the grade school and that was how they become masters in their fields, he said. 
When compared with the education system of the US, he said Sri Lankas education system, which was introduced by the British, doesnt give room for innovation. 
The education system in the US is very broad. It is the most fundamental reason why the US is worlds leader in innovation. Their education is based on problem-based learning and even the students aged 10 or 12 come up with the most practical ideas which can be developed into projects, he said. 
Mano Sekaram, CEO of 99x Technologies and Chairman of Lanka Angel Network, delivered a speech under the theme of Digital and Knowledge Economy and said Sri Lanka needs to transform itself into a complete digitalized country. 
We have to upgrade our digital infrastructure. The field of Information and Communication Technology has done a tremendous job over the years. It has to be strengthened. We should look at what UBER and AIRBNB have done. Without owing a single hotel, AIRBNB has become the worlds largest hotel service provider. Thats the way of thinking for Sri Lanka to go forward, he said. 
He said when developing the country, the first aspect we need to build is human capital, which is considered as the greatest asset of the world. 
Human capital is what Israel has utilized. In Sri Lanka, 200,000 students qualify for university entrance after A/L each year. Only 30,000 get into state universities, 10,000 fly abroad and 20,000 enroll at private universities in here. The rest is left behind. Since 70 years of independence, this is the great injustice caused to our young generation, Mano Sekeram said.
He said we need to have people who take up challenges and even if they fail, failure is acceptable. We need entrepreneurs who will take challenges, he said. 
Dr. Mohammad Ismath Ramzy, Senior Lecturer of the Educational Foundations And Humanities Department at Malaya University in Malaysia, said countries in Asia would face challenges at home when the worlds economy shifts towards Asia.
However, he said the issued stemmed from the large population sizes in countries like China and India would not be apparent in Sri Lanka. He said India is already struggling with its rural population. 
Commenting on the Education system in Sri Lanka, Dr. Ramzy said an analysis of the quality of education system in Sri Lanka is vital . 
Sri Lankan education system faces criticism for lack of entrepreneurship and failure to match the job market. The education system needs to be updated with hard skills including literacy in Information and Communications Technology (ICT) competence and soft skills such as problem solving and creativity. 
He said since science and technology system is not promising, adopting to innovative culture is possible only through exercising effective research and development in the public sector. 
Former Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, Dr. Nalaka Godahewa expressed his opinions over the Aspirations for a People-Centric Economy, said Samsung Corporation, the South Korean Multinational Conglomerate Company made a revenue of US$ 174 billion in 2017, a turnover which is more than double the GDP of Sri Lanka during the same year. 
He said Facebook Corporations Head Mark Zuckerbergs current assets are valued at about US$ 74 billion where as Sri Lankas GDP is about US$ 84 billion. 
The economy of Sri Lanka is growing at about 3%-4% rate where as Facebook Corporations growth rate is about 25%. So we can reasonably assume that its owners wealth may exceed the size of Sri Lankas economy by next year. Mark Zuckerberg is 33 years old, whereas Sri Lanka gained independence 70 years ago! he said. 
He said the economic management policies of Sri Lanka had never been consistent and they have shifted from one direction to another with change of governments. 
He said it was important for Sri Lanka to think independently. No economic crisis is permanent. Sri Lanka can always find ways to come out of this crisis with right strategy. What is important is to find the way for sustainable development. The aspiration is for a people-centric economy based on the three pillars; stability, progress and dignity, he said. 
Delivering a speech under the theme Social Innovation, Future of Business and the Rise of the Millennial, Founder of Social Enterprise Lanka and Co-creater of Ath Pavura Eranda Ginige said the traditional method of development was not scientific. 
The traditional method of development is to exponentially grow the industries. If all developing countries developed in this manner at once, we will be needing resources of more than four planets to sustain the development. Therefore, if developed countries are to maintain their development, other countries should always remain in the category of developing, he said. 
He said the development of Sri Lanka should be suitable to us, our resources, climate, peoples requirements. 
Other countries rich with resources still invest in wind and solar power, which are sustainable, so they can save their resources to the future generations. If we can transform Sri Lanka into a country with sustainability in renewable energy before 2035. To develop architecture suitable to the future climate and reduce wastage of electricity, we can achieve social innovation, he said. 
Mr. Ginige said most of the policy makers and business people still follow the old traditional economic system in the country. 
It is true that some have succeeded through this method. However, we should decide whether to go along with the old, destructive and unproductive development method or start our own development. We should also give the opportunity to the new generation, to the millennial, he said. 
Former President and MP Mahinda Rajapaksa, Members of Parliament, political leaders, academics, professionals, artiste and many others attended the annual convention.

## Title: SLT Group 1Q 2018 EBITDA up by 8.5% to Rs 6.1 bn
## Section: Press Releases

SLT Group 1Q 2018 EBITDA up by 8.5% to Rs 6.1 bn
	
Sri Lanka Telecom PLC (SLT) released its Group and Company financial results for the 1st Quarter 2018, today.
The group has reported EBITDA or Operating Profit before depreciation and amortization of Rs. 6.1 bn during the 1st quarter 2018, with a Year on Year increase of 8.5%. The EBITDA margin of the Group increased from 30.1% last year to 30.8%. Controlling of cost escalations while sustaining revenue growth have resulted in better EBITDA levels. The group revenue for the quarter under review was reported at Rs. 19.8 bn with Year on Year growth of 5.9%, while operating cost was reported at Rs. 13.7 bn during the quarter with 4.7% Year on Year increase.
Large investments made by the group during the recent years have continued to affect the company profits adversely due to mainly the increased charges in depreciation. The Group Depreciation and amortization have increased by Rs.512 mn in absolute terms showing a 12.8% Year on Year increase to Rs.4.5 bn. This increase of Depreciation and amortization has resulted in a marginal drop in Group operating profit to Rs. 1.58 bn compared to Rs 1.62 bn in the corresponding period of previous year. The group has largely invested in new technology and capacity expansion of LTE, FTTH, IPTV, Global connectivity and Mobile services in catering the expanding customer base and providing more services.
The gamut of SLTs investments in the recent past also included the expansion of National Backbone Network, launching of its newly built state-of-the-art Tier 3 Data Centre the countrys first Purpose built tier 3 Data Centre, SEA-ME-WE 5 undersea cable system, and newly established cable landing station in Matara within the third quarter. SLT is also committed to further oversee South Asias first cutting-edge submarine cable depot in the Galle Port. With enhancing multiple global connectivity options with SEA-ME-We 5 international submarine cable system, company also provides global connectivity backhauling facility to international operators.
Increase of depreciation and amortization coupled with a drop in other income and interest income have further narrowed by 12.1% and 19.0% drop respectively the Group Profit Before Tax and Profit for the period to Rs. 1.6 bn and Rs. 1.2 bn compared to the same period of previous year.
The holding Company have reported Rs.3.5 bn EBITDA or Operating profit before Depreciation and Amortization with Year on year growth of 13.2%. The Company has been able to enhance its EBITDA margin to 30.0% from 27.2% a year before, keeping its operating costs at Rs. 8.1bn, 1.1% year on year lower while increasing the revenues to Rs.11.5 bn with 2.8% year on year growth. As reasoning out under group performance, the company depreciation and amortization have also increased almost to Rs.3 bn during the 1st quarter 2018. Despite the increase of depreciation and amortization the company reported an Operating Profit of Rs. 502 mn during the 1st quarter 2018, with an increase of 4% from same quarter of the previous year. Impacting largely from drop in other income to Rs.120 mn during the 1st Quarter 2018, the Profit before tax and Profit for the period have reported at Rs. 501 mn and Rs. 332 mn reporting year compared to Rs 627m and Rs 545m.
Despite the higher depreciation and amortization challenging the profitability, these investments have largely enhanced the company asset base. Further the company expects robust profitability in the future by sustainable growth in revenues through capacity utilizations and effective cost management.

Sri Lanka is the only country that has eradicated terrorism: Army Chief
	
Army Commander Lieutenant General Mahesh Senanayake said during an interview with the Hindu News paper that Sri Lanka was the one and only country on the world map that had eradicated terrorism from its soil.
We are a victorious army. Once the combat is over, it is the responsibility of the army itself to understand its role and task. The last nine years were very critical to understand what happened 30 years ago, he said.
The excerpt of the Interview:
It is nine years since the civil war ended. The period has witnessed some crucial political developments, including a regime change in 2015. The current government came to power on the promise of strengthening democracy. In this post-war context, how do you see the role of the army
The Sri Lankan army had been a traditional army, a ceremonial army, back in the 1970s, early 1980s. Due to the negative incidents that took place in the early 1980s, the army was expanded to face the challenges and threats that came in the way of the countrys territorial integrity and internal security.
The army put in the main effort to ensure there is peace that the people aspired for, making many sacrifices. In recent history, Sri Lanka is the one and only country on the world map that has eradicated terrorism from its soil. We are a victorious army.
Once the combat is over, it is the responsibility of the army itself to understand its role and task. The last nine years were very critical to understand what happened 30 years ago. What must this government and army do to ensure that we dont go back to the roots of the conflict that began 30 years ago We have to find a mechanism, a commitment within the country to satisfy our own people more than the people outside. Today, we are closer to a better solution. Democracy was restored, elections were held [in 2015], good governance was brought in.
In this context, we are right-sizing and building a capacity-based army. We have to give back to the people by right-sizing and ensuring that the war will not recur. We are engaging with the people in the north and east to identify our responsibility. The 30 years of war were brutal, many lives were lost on both sides. This is a sort of testing period for us. Maybe till 2020. I believe that will be the time to take a good jump. As Chief of the Army Staff, I can say that the army is the only organisation which has the biggest capacity, be it human resource or anything else.
In Sri Lanka, as in some other parts of the world, the military is highly politicised. How are you negotiating that
In the past, extra politicisation was there. Of course, the war is an extension of politics, we do know and understand that. But today, with the change of government in 2015, we are proud to say that we are not under pressure. As an army commander, I am not under pressure from my Minister, the President, or the Prime Minister. That means, politicisation of the armed forces has been curtailed or is very minimal.
In 2015, we had [presidential] elections in a democratic way. There were a lot of allegations on the armed forces  especially the army  that they got involved in politics in January 2015. The same year, in August, we had [parliamentary] elections. The same people who earlier accused us were asking, Where are you This February, we had another election [local government polls]. People say many members of the armed forces were voting against the government. That means there was no politicisation or pressure. We never pressured our soldiers to vote a particular way; we allowed them to vote for the person they wanted. There may be a few individuals who have their own affiliations with political parties, but otherwise generally they have the right to decide what they want to do.
You served as the Commander of the Security Forces in Jaffna in 2016, overseeing some efforts towards resettlement of the war-displaced Tamil community. President Maithripala Sirisena recently told Parliament that 85% of peoples land occupied by the military has been returned. Why did it take this long
Based on our study after the war ended, we evolved a 2020 plan and a 2025 plan. We know which land can be released at what time. Before 2015, there were many other reasons, the people were not sure what was going to happen. But after 2015, and that is why I say there is no politicisation or pressure, the decision is being taken by the armed forces itself. We have understood where it is strategically and tactically important to stay, what the nodal points are. We decide how best we can bring normalcy, giving the maximum to the people who are legally entitled to it.
I look at it like this. This is a country in which we have Internally Displaced Persons [IDP] camps. About 3,00,000 [civilians] joined us after the humanitarian operation. As many as 13,169 ex-LTTE cadres surrendered. Our aim is to make this country free of IDP camps. You should not have internally displaced people in your own country. I can understand somewhere else, but not here.
But there are reasons for them to stay in camps. One, they dont have the land. Secondly, in some instances, the people who stayed back [and did not migrate] belong to the third generation, and dont own land. We are addressing this by engaging with the Tamil political leadership in the north and east, for them to understand that this is your army. This is not a Sinhalese army, this is a Sri Lankan army.
Until now about 80% of the land has been released. The remaining Still 2% of the land mass is yet to be de-mined. We had three types of minefields  one laid by the Sri Lankan armed forces, we have the records for that. Secondly, those laid by the LTTE, we do not have the records for that. And thirdly, those laid by the IPKF [Indian Peace Keeping Force], we dont have records for that too. When you say humanitarian de-mining, it should be 100%. It will take time. So, 2020 will be our target for that.
On April 13, we released 683 acres in Palaly, a critical area. It was a very bold decision as far as the Sri Lankan armed forces are concerned and we took it. We calculated the risk, nobody pressured us. Frankly, even the government or the political leadership did not know that we were going to release land there.
In another four to five months, we will return more land. We have identified some private land on which armed forces are stationed. We cannot compromise on national security. For that reason, we have to have some troops in those areas, and we are shifting them to state land. I need some finances for us to resettle.
The Resettlement Ministry has paid LKR 150 million to the army as compensation to relocate from private land that the people once lived on, or cultivated. Given that the Defence Ministry has the highest budgetary allocation, why would you need these additional funds, which are meant for peoples resettlement, to return the land that rightfully belongs to the people
The army has two programmes. One is sustainment; the other is modernisation. To sustain the army, it is not only about land or capital investment. Maintenance of our inventory is key. We are spending about the same amount, but the value of money has gone down. When we shift from one place to the other, leaving behind some things, there is a need for redeployment or to establish something, for which you need capital. If the Government of Sri Lanka decides that money should be allocated from that Ministry, I am not interested in where the money comes from.
As per the Appropriation Bill ahead of the 2018 Budget, the Ministry of Defence was allotted LKR 260,711,375,000 ($1.6 billion) as recurrent expenditure and LKR 30 billion ($190 million) as capital expenditure, the highest allocation in the Budget. How do you justify such a huge allocation, nine years after the war ended Is it for modernisation
More than modernisation, it is for sustainment because costs have gone up. During the war, we were not living comfortably. In the post-war scenario, to ensure that there is no war again, the army is being deployed in different areas and the basics have to be given to them. Even that costs money.
You spoke about right-sizing. Why do you still need so many uniformed men in the north and east, almost a decade after you defeated the LTTE The people have voiced concern over the armys involvement in civilian activity, particularly in agricultural farms and as preschool teachers, seeing it as continuing militarisation. Why must the army get involved in these areas
It is a perception among some segments of society. If you take north and east, take the capacity of any organisation. Thirty years of war have left our community in the north at a disadvantage. The government machinery was not functioning for decades. There was a big gap and our services are needed to address it. The armed forces deployed in the north are the only organisations who have the capacity to perform.
I have been discussing this with the [northern] Chief Minister, requesting him to use our capacity. Some can look at our presence negatively, but a majority will accept it. Then there is the question of security itself. By that I mean security concerns from non-traditional threats.
What are they
For example, drugs, human smuggling. In Sri Lanka today, drug trafficking and drug abuse is a non-traditional threat. Our newspapers often report news of Kerala ganja being smuggled. We are in close proximity of our neighbours. Everybody is not doing it, the Indian government doesnt do it, but it comes here. And it is being distributed. Our Tamil population has never experienced this threat in history, and that is why there is a security force requirement as of today, until the police does policing correctly. There is a gap in policing, law and order. The day that Sri Lankan police does proper policing, we will be the happiest to go inside a camp and play cricket or come back to the south.
In the north, definitely there is a reduction in our troops. We are in the process of right-sizing. This does not mean downsizing. The number may be the same but the deployment is different.
Is this the security sector reform that Sri Lanka committed to at the Human Rights Council in 2015 Where does that stand
If I talk about the figure, when I joined the army it was totally about 10,000 in number. But at the end of the conflict, we were an army of 2,36,000. It has been reduced by almost 50,000 now. I agree that we are not exhibiting what we are doing. Then we want to discipline the society. We believe that by disciplining the society these problems will not be there. It has happened all over the world. But when we do it, it is interpreted differently. That is why you are asking that question.
Your army has been under international scrutiny for some time. Do you feel pressured
If we were listening to only what the international community was saying, not only Sri Lanka, any other country will not prosper. We would have not won the war. The peace that everybody enjoys today, irrespective of whether youre a Sinhalese or Tamil, north or south, would have never been there. So, at that time, with political will and public support, all armed forces, everybody got together and we finished that. Now we face allegations, those are baseless.
No war was fought with zero casualty. If the accusations against anyone are proved in the courts, there will be no sympathy from our side. We want to maintain discipline so we are ready to face any inquiry, but within the legal framework of Sri Lanka.
You spoke of non-conventional threats. But in terms of conventional threats, both domestic and international, how is Sri Lanka placed today in your assessment
Sri Lanka is a peaceful country today. We are not expecting any external aggression but internally, being an island and with people living here with different motives, a few skirmishes could take place. But touch wood, from May 19, 2009, till date there has been not a single explosion or round of firing in the name of the LTTE or terrorism. That means we are a model to the world on how to progress in a post-conflict scenario.
But it is the responsibility of any nation to prepare for war. That doesnt mean only internal, it maybe regional. We are our neighbours [Indias] closest friend, we have almost 1,00,000 Sri Lankans living there and we have more than 10,000-15,000 of them living here. It is a security concern, not a threat.
We have Muslim brothers and sisters living here, about 10% of the population. There is no Islamic State here. There are very few self-motivated people. They are not motivated by Madrasas, or by any mosque, but just through the Internet. They work here. It is common to any society, to other countries also. It is not organised, just a few individuals. Then it is our responsibility to ensure that a capacity-based army is ready for any eventuality. All this is manageable.
We have more than 12,000 Chinese who have come for work here. More than 10,000 Indians work here. They are innocent, but somebody could utilise or exploit them for their gains. There are 13,169 ex-LTTE cadres who are living with us. There are a few who are rehabilitated and are living abroad.
They have enough reasons to create problems here for their own survival abroad. It is a fact.
Could you talk about military cooperation with Pakistan and China Do you find any tensions or challenges in these partnerships when it comes to other relationships For example, with India or the U.S.
Historically, Sri Lanka has been a non-aligned country. We are neutral, so we value all our neighbours. Our biggest neighbour and best friend is India. We are looking forward to the Indian army chiefs visit [currently ongoing]. For army commanders, these regional visits are common. The Pakistan army chief was here. I went to Pakistan, met the President, the Prime Minister. I was in India in March but unfortunately, I was called back after the first day because of the problems [anti-Muslim attacks] in Kandy. I am waiting to go back to my college. I did my civil engineering degree in Pune. A majority of Sri Lankan army officers are trained in India.
We have exercises with India, Pakistan, the Chinese, and the U.S. because this is neutral. We believe we are a good strength for SAARC, whether it is economically or militarily. Because we are neutral.

Sri Lankans stuck in an alcohol quagmire
	
Beer, wine, liquor, and whiskey carry the label alcohol. In some countries, consuming alcohol is illegal. In others, it is a widespread practice. The consumption of alcohol carries a risk of adverse health and social consequences related to its intoxicating, toxic and dependence-producing properties.
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), approximately 2.5 million deaths are caused annually due to the consumption of liquor. That number is equivalent to nearly 4% of global fatalities. Besides, alcohol is associated with more than 200 diseases and conditions and is a major risk factor for Non-Communicable Diseases. 
According to the latest Non-Communicable Disease Risk Factors Survey Sri Lanka 2015, 34.8% males consume alcohol. 42.3% of those who consume alcohol fall into the age category of 30-44 years while 42.7% of the males who consume alcohol fall into the age category of 45-59.
Only 0.5% of the females consume alcohol. The great majority (93.9%) of the current male drinkers is estimated to be consuming low end level alcohol and only 3.5% is consuming high end level alcohol. It is estimated that 5.5% of those in the adult group were drinking daily and this group comprised only males. More than two thirds (69.9%) of the group was estimated to drink 1 to 3 days a month or less.
Alcohol invadesthe island 
Alcohol has become abundantly available in Sri Lanka over the past three decades with the liberalization of trade and open economy policies adopted since 1977. This has led to some sections of the population being open to greater risk of alcohol-related harm. These include the low income, unemployed, or partially employed rural and urban working population who are mainly addicted to consuming of illicit alcohol.
Speaking with the , Senior Lecturer in Health Promotion at Rajarata University of Sri Lanka, Dr. Manoj Fernando said alcohol consumption in Sri Lanka is on the rise. He said that Sri Lanka is consequently the second highest alcohol consuming country among South Asian countries.
Alcohol is mostly used in urban areas and mainly consumed by adults. One third (34.8%) of the males are alcohol users, while 40.2% are lifetime abstainers. A great majority (96.5%) of females are lifetime abstainers, Dr. Fernando said.
He stressed that the Governments decision to reduce the tax on beer by 40% and
simplify the issuance and rate structure of liquor retail licenses, would further increase beer consumption by 22.5% within next two years and eventually the total alcohol consumption would also increase.
Therefore he suggested that multiple approaches need to be taken by the authorities in order to control the alcohol consumption and overcome this liquor menace. He added that the Government should aim more at discouraging the production of liquor than trying to reduce the consumption of alcohol. 
The global average for alcohol consumption is approximately 6.2 liters per person per year. Belarus has the highest level of alcohol consumption in the world, with an average of 17.5 liters of pure alcohol consumed per capita annually. 
One of the factors that seems to contribute to a higher than average level of alcohol consumption is the absence of public health campaigns that educate people about the negative consequences of consuming alcohol. Other factors include depressed economies, high poverty rates and cultural attitudes.
Why production of alcohol should be controlled 
Speaking with the , Alcohol and Drug Information Center (ADIC) CEO Pubudu Sumanasekera highlighted that Sri Lankas alcohol industry was trying to manipulate the Government policies on alcohol and adjust them according to their wishes.
The matter is that the policies and laws pertaining to alcohol that are placed before the alcohol manufactures are taken for granted without being taken into consideration. That is the way the issue has transpired. If the Government controls the production and the distribution of alcohol in an efficient manner, the issue of consumption of liquor can be addressed with ease, Sumanasekera opined.
As we have observed, the alcohol industry of Sri Lanka is trying to take over the controlling of policies by the Government instead of carrying them out. If this continues, protecting Sri Lanka from this alcohol hazard will remain a dream, he added. 
He suggested that the alcohol industry should work in collaboration with the Government in view of finding better solutions to end the excessive consumption of alcohol in Sri Lanka. 
How about the tax reduction on beer 
The 2018 Budget reduced excise taxes on strong beer by 40% and raised taxes on hard liquor by 2%. The Budget also introduced a nation building tax of 2% on all alcoholic beverage sales with effect from April this year. Different people comment differently on the decision taken by the Government. Some seem to be positive whereas others seem to be negative. Thus, it is essential to talk on this topic using different perspectives. 
With the latest tax revisions, barring further changes, the market share for beer in Sri Lanka, as calculated by Fitch, is expected to increase by 24%-25% in the medium term, posting an average volume growth of 22% over 2017-2019. 
Sumanasekera said that the proposals of the Budget 2018 to decrease the tax on beer by 40% and to issue licenses to sell alcohol with a new strategy, would bring tragedy to the country.
He said that although the reduction of tax on beer was done in view of promoting the tourism industry and discouraging the consumption of moonshine (Kasippu), it would not in anyway contribute to the efforts in attracting foreigners nor reducing the consumption of moonshine.
The introduction of a new flexible procedure to issue license would provide more room for anyone to start a liquor shop and consequently the consumption of alcohol would rapidly rise in Sri Lanka. We cannot fathom as to why the Finance Minister has made such proposals to which the consent wasnt received from both President and the Minister of Health, said Sumanasekera. 
He further said that the system of monopoly in the tobacco industry in Sri Lanka might change with permission given to new tobacco companies to import liquor from abroad with the easy access of possessing licenses.
Meanwhile Dr. Fernando criticized the Governments decision to revise the opening hours of all liquor stores. Although President Sirisena abolished the gazette notification pertaining to the opening hours of all liquor stores, the decision itself by the Ministry of Finance was stupid. 
Overcoming this menace
The current alcohol use among males has increased in comparison to the prevalence observed in 2008 (34.8% in 2015 and 26.0% in 2008).This is an alarming issue and it is necessary to voice the need to evaluate the current strategies and policies in view of implementing an accelerated programme. 
It is estimated that 16.8% of males adults had indulged in binge drinking (six or more drinks on a single occasion and at least once during a month) compared to only 0.1 % of the females who binge drink. This underscores the need to adapt the current programmes to address these critical issues. 
National Authority on Tobacco and Alcohol (NATA) Chairman Dr. Palitha Abeykoon told the that the per capita consumption of liquor in Sri Lanka is 3.5 litres per year and added that it is comparatively higher than other countries.
It is appropriate to decrease or discourage the supply of alcohol by imposing higher taxes on the production of alcohol related beverages. On the other hand, the general public should be educated with regard to the consequences of consuming alcohol.
The awareness programmes should be commenced from school level and should continue from village to village. Special attention should be paid to prevent the youth and needy people from getting addicted to alcohol.
In conclusion, it is vital to realize the fact that the consumption of alcohol only drags us to the end of life and exposes us to harmful consequences. At the same time, the consumption of alcohol not only deteriorates your life, but also causes trouble to teetotalers. For example when a father returns home drunk daily and shouts at the members of the family, it would cause mental stress and irritation to the others. Likewise, those who dont consume alcohol would suffer at the hands of alcohol users. Therefore Sri Lankans should rethink of the use of alcohol and its repercussions and create an anti-alcohol society in Sri Lanka.

Tales of a centenarian ex-tea plucker
	
A 103-year-old woman by the name of Muththu Theivani, who once worked as a tea plucker in the Spring Valley Estate in Badulla, recalled her days spent among the Tea bushes mixing with other fellow women who were employed in the estate.
Theivani said that she joined this estate at the age of 12 and earned 18 cents per day. She now spends her retirement in a line room (Quarters for estate workers) adjacent to the estates tea factory.
Those days this place looked so beautiful with fertilizer being used regularly and the tea bushes producing crop abundantly. Now the estate looks neglected. During our time we looked after it as our own eyes. Now tears roll down our cheeks when we see the present plight of the tea estate, she said.
Since of late she has been of service to the estate families by being a person who performs religious rituals and invokes blessings during sicknesses. She performs these services for free, but feels happy and contended with what they gift her with
The Europeans at the outset brought labour from India to work in these tea estates. When Theivanis parents came to Sri Lanka for this purpose she was only four years old. She joined other workers at a young age. When she reached age 18 she received 49 cents per day, the amount paid to other workers. The workers used to grow Green Gram, Cow Pea and other pulses in their gardens at home. At that time they had enough to eat. Every household had a dairy farm with one or two milking cows. The milk was consumed by the workers and never sold.
She remembered how the owner of the estate arrived on horseback and inspected the line rooms. If these places were found to be unclean or not maintained properly a fine of Rs 100 was imposed. The walls of the line rooms had to be applied with a lime preparation every six months. The drains were cleaned once a week using Jeys Fluid. There were no mosquitoes because the place was kept clean.
No schooling
There were no schools in the estates at that time. Theivanis father never believed in educating the children as it was better for them to work in the estate and look after their cattle. The family had a herd comprising 20 heads of cattle, among which were 5 milking cows. She remembered how cheerful they were when they went in groups to pluck tea leaves in the early hours of the morning. The end of each day was exciting for the group because they wound up activities with a bath in the nearby water spring.
Love was not in the air for her at that time. However she was given in marriage at the age of 16 to G. Muththu from Badulla. She had seven children from this marriage; five daughters and two sons.
Her husband was a travelling merchant selling gold jewellery. The estate women were enchanted by these gold ornaments that were on sale. She remembered wearing heavy gold earings weighing about 7 sovereigns each, but now those ears are bare. The earlobes have been stretched due to the weight of the gold ear studs she once wore.
Uses Viber
Her eldest son had died of a heart ailment at the age of 35. Her husband also died in a similar manner. She has a son who is in India and frequently speaks with her using Viber. Theivani has never been a burden to anyone in the estate or to her family. Now she tends to the needs of her grandchildren until their parents return home from working in the estate. She has her own poultry yard which provides her with seven or eight eggs a day which helps her to keep the home fires burning.
Since of late she has been of service to the estate families by being a person who performs religious rituals and invokes blessings during sicknesses. She performs these services for free, but feels happy and contended with what they gift her with. Though age and frailty have taken over she never forgets to go on her annual pilgrimage to Kataragama. Earlier the estate people used to go on pilgrimage to Kataragama in groups.
They used to collect the food and other requirements needed for the journey. She remembered how they used to travel through forests teemed with elephants. Their good intentions and the faith they have in God helped them to accomplish their mission without being harmed by wild elephants. She said she believed that the elephants are the ghosts of God Ganapathy and when they are on the way to honour God Ganapathy these ghosts would never harm them. She does Kawadi dancing at Kataragama where she gets into a trance. She said that she greatly enjoys it.
She said that she believes that the elephant symbol signifies the Lord Ganapathy and reiterated that it would have been better if the Europeans were still in Sri Lanka managing these tea estates.

Talks with Dy Minister fails; Now meeting with Nimal: Bus union
	
The Inter-Provincial Private Bus Association (IPPBA) today said it would go ahead with the scheduled bus strike tonight since the discussions they had with Transport Deputy Minister Asoka Abesinghe had failed.
The IPPBA President Sarath Vijitha Kumara said the Deputy Minister had requested to wait till next Tuesday (22) for the final decision.
However, the bus associations joined with the IPPBA had come with a decision not to wait. 
Waiting for Ministers decision till Tuesday is not reasonable and we should get final decision today itself to change the decision of tonights strike, Mr Vijitha Kumara said.
Sources said that Transport Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva is at meeting with bus association members now.
It is a miracle that we have a discussion with a Transport Minister after many years. However, if the Minister could not accept our requirement, strike will be launched tonight, Mr Kumara said. (Chaturanga Samarawickrama)

## Title: WHY THE POMP AND PAGEANTRY

WHY THE POMP AND PAGEANTRY
	
What was the need for all the Pomp and Pageantry Was it deserved in any way We read that over a 1,000 questions and more than 1,000 petitions had to be set aside due to the prorogation!!!
So, why the Pomp and Pageantry As Minister Fonseka rightly pointed out, it is too late now for the Government to even try to fulfil its promises. When the Prime Minister was bravely trying to justify the actions of this Government at an interview he gave the press some time ago, he admitted that they had not paid any heed to the development of the country!!! WHY What did the PM actually think they were elected to do Travel the world!!! If not the development of the country, then what Can they come up with anything dedicated or anything constructive now, can they If so, the country has a right to know!!! They are experts at making Policy Statements but not delivering the goods!!!
In addition to development, the people had also expected that the massive SCAMS and all the fraudsters and conmen who had perpetrated the crimes, would be brought to book, but even this has not been accomplished!!! When Minister Fonseka was asked if the Government would be able to bring these large-scale fraudsters to book; he said and I quote:
Now there is no choice and those who have been entrusted with this responsibility will have to carry out their responsibility and deliver the results expected by the people. There is a very short time left, but if the right strategy is implemented, this task is achievable.
That, my friends, is the MOOT POINT!!! If the right strategy is implemented!!! The burning question is WILL IT BE IMPLEMENTED OR WILL MORE EXCUSES BE GIVEN, AS ALWAYS
The JVPers are of the opinion that the Ceremonial Opening of Parliament was a colossal waste of money!!! It certainly was!!! What was there to celebrate anyway The continuance of people who CANNOT and WILL NOT KEEP THEIR WORD!!!
The countrys resources are depleted; we do not have money to be throwing away on GALAS, notwithstanding Ceremonial Sittings of Parliament!!! They are, strictly speaking, not entitled to this because they have done nothing to justify a Ceremonial Sitting!!! Their ranks are in chaos, absolute chaos and they have plunged the country into greater chaos!!! Despite all this, they still felt the need to revert to a Ceremonial Sitting of Parliament, which was certainly not a useful but a wasteful exercise!!!
FINALLY, FINALLY, WE HEAR ONE MAN WITH A CONSCIENCE, WITH A BACKBONE SAYING LAWS DELAY, BANE OF COUNTRYS JUDICIAL SYSTEM - CONGRATULATIONS! Mr Sumanthiran, this has been a long-awaited need. Laws delay has been the bane of our judicial system so long. Therefore, even in the Criminal Justice System, the accused in very serious cases have often escaped their due punishment by making use of the laws delays, said TNA MP M.A. Sumanthiran!!!
This is exactly what this column has been continuously asking and to which we have had no answers!!! You raised this EXTREMELY GRAVE QUESTION during the debate on the Amendment to the Judicature Act in Parliament. Establishing a permanent High Court at Bar to try certain categories of cases was a desperate need in the interest of JUSTICE!!! The need is to deal with large-scale corruption!!!
When the people of our country look to their leaders, SADLY, they have nothing to learn!!! No bright shining examples have been set for people to follow!!! NOTHING!!! It is a miracle that INSURANCE has been allowed for school children!!! We shudder  how long before this benefit is also torn to shreds and the undeniable usefulness of this long felt need for our children is torn asunder Have we heard of a single Minister in this country, contributing to ANYTHING Anything in the name of HUMANITY AND WE DRAW A BLANK!!!
The problem of old age in Sri Lanka is increasing by leaps and bounds but other than setting up Old Age Homes that cost a fortune, has the Government addressed this problem in any way Oh yes, they have, when Ravi K. was Minister of Finance, he imposed VAT on the homes and we are still grumbling!!! I witnessed an unprecedented act of humanity yesterday at the Mount Lavinia Hotel, where around 50 or 60 people were hosted to lunch, ALL OLD LADIES WITH NOTHING AND NO ONE TO DO ANYTHING FOR THEM!!! THEY HAVE BEEN LEFT BEHIND IN HOMES BY THEIR CHILDREN AND THAT IS WHERE THEIR OBLIGATIONS END!!! This is true in almost every home in the country!!! The General Manager of Mount Lavinia Hotel had decided to bring a ray of sunshine into the lives of these poor ladies by hosting them to a super lunch, greeting each and every one of them with a spray of flowers on arrival and adding music and dancing as well to make their day a happy one!!! Poor people, men and women alike, spend their twilight years in utter loneliness, some in ABJECT POVERTY!!! Has anyone EVER ADDRESSED THE QUESTION OF SUSTAINABLE POVERTY
Perhaps a small pension!!! No that is too much to ask or even expect!!! We only know who you are when we need your vote!!!
What are the benefits that are accruing to us RISE IN THE PRICES OF GAS, PETROL, DIESEL, KEROSENE, MILK POWDER, BUS FARE, THREE-WHEELER CAB FARE AND EVEN SOME RICE WHICH WAS ORIGINALLY SOLD AT RS. 65/- A KILO IS NOW RS. 80/- A KILO!!!
So, these are the benefits accruing to us Sri Lankans, while the Government concentrates on STRENGTHENING CO-OPERATION WITH AS MANY COUNTRIES AS POSSIBLE!!! We wonder why It would be beneficial to the country if they concentrate instead on the LAW AND ORDER SITUATION HERE!!! For instance, in the jungle area surrounding Siri Pada Adaviya and Kuruwita Erathna; WALLAPATTA IS BEING FREELY ROBBED AND MOST OF IT SMUGGLED ABROAD!!! There are supposed FOREST DEPARTMENT CHECKPOINTS, which serve no purpose because no one cares AND THERE IS NO ONE MANNING THESE CHECKPOINTS!!! The Buddhist Priest in the area has complained but with no redress. Huge Lorries come and go taking with them loads of WALLAPATTA and other valuable timber with the surrounding forest area being torn apart!!! SO MUCH FOR THE ENVIRONMENT!!!
As we have said before, the magnitude of inhumanity, corruption, both large and small scale, is difficult to imagine in a Buddhist country!!! Why cant our buffoons, if they are not religious minded, at least learn from words of wisdom from what the great Einstein said: We cannot solve our problems with the same thinking we used when we created them!!!

Will Meghans father skip the royal wedding 
	

Will Meghan Markles father be at his daughters wedding this Saturday to walk his daughter down the aisle 
It was the subject of fevered speculation among royal watchers on Monday night after Prince Harry and Meghan Markle asked for understanding amid claims that Thomas Markle, Meghans father, wont be attending the royal wedding on May 19. 
Kensington Palace, the official residence of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, issued a statement late Monday following the allegations that Markles father, who lives in Mexico, had pulled out of the wedding. The statement did not confirm or deny speculation surrounding his attendance. 
This is a deeply personal moment for Ms. Markle in the days before her wedding. She and Prince Harry ask again for understanding and respect to be extended to Mr. Markle in this difficult situation, the statement said. 
According to the celebrity news site TMZ, Markle has pulled out of the wedding because he doesnt want to embarrass his daughter or the royal family. The news website also claimed that he had recently suffered a heart attack. 
The reports of a possible no-show by Markles father were splashed across the front pages of several British newspapers on Tuesday. 
Markles half-sister Samantha said that she was the one to blame for the snaps and that they were intended to portray her father in a positive light.
