Five Lankans held for villa thefts in Dubai
	
	The Dubai Police have busted a gang of five Sri Lankans who stand accused of stealing millions of dirhams worth of valuables from villas in Dubai before attempting to flee the country.
	On Monday, the Dubai Police Operations Room received information about a theft in a villa in Dubai's Al Barsha area. The police rushed to the scene and were told by the homeowner, an Emirati, that when he came home at 9.30pm he found the villa's doors broken. Watches worth Dh250,000 and Dh100,000 in cash were stolen.
	Police investigation revealed that the modus operandi was the same as in eight other villas in the area. The police arrested four of the suspects as they tried to leave the country through Dubai International Airport.

	The men confessed that they often stole from vacant villas. They would ring the doorbell and if they did not receive any response, one suspect would climb the wall and open the door to three others, while the fifth would stand watch outside.
	The fifth suspect was also found to be violating the UAE residence laws. All five men have been referred to the Dubai Public Prosecution. (Source: Khaleej Times)

Lotus Tower: No added expenses due to construction delay
	
Despite the delays in constructing the Lotus Tower, which is scheduled to be completed by October 2017, the estimated expenses have not increased, the Telecommunication Regulatory Commission of Sri Lanka (TRCSL) yesterday said.
Recently appointed TRCSL Director General Sunil Sirisena said under an agreement signed with the construction company ensured the cost of construction did not increase due to delays.
The main structure of the building had been completed. Construction of the Lotus Tower and installing the elevators were the only work that remained, he said.
The Sri Lanka Telecom (SLT) would look into the tenders of the office complexes and businesses that will be set up inside the building. Everything inside the building would be digital technology and not analogue technology, he said.
Last year construction of the building came to a halt when Minister of Ports and Shipping Arjuna Ranatunga, claimed the land on which the building was constructed belonged to the Sri Lanka Ports Authority and that the land had not been obtained through proper legal means.
The building has been constructed on land belonging to the TRCSL. However, we need more land to construct other facilities around the building and we are discussing the transfer of land with the necessary authorities, he said.
Once completed the 530 meter building, the tallest in South Asia, will be used for communication, observation and other leisure facilities.(Darshana Sanjeewa)

Minister to inquire into poor performance in NZ
	
	Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekera will meet the national teams top management on their return to the island from New Zealand to unearth the factors which may have contributed to teams shocking performance.
	Angelo Mathews men lost the two-match Test series 2-0, five-match ODI series 3-1 and two-match T20I series 2-0 to complete one of their worst defeats in recent history.
	We have a serious problem before us. We have slid (down the rankings) in all formats including T20 which we were on top for many years. So we need to ascertain what had really contributed to this downward trend and try to fix it before it gets worse, the Minister of Sports said.
	Sri Lanka dropped to number three in T20I rankings having been on top for several years following the 2-0 drubbing against New Zealand and are placed seventh in Tests and fifth in ODIs, which the minister said were the achievements of the interim committee.
	Accordingly, he will meet skipper Mathews, national team manager Jeryl Woutersz and chief selector Kapila Wijegunawardane.
	I have also read a number of online posts where serious allegations of misconduct were being levelled against the players and the team management. I want to know the truth. I want to know what happened in New Zealand, the minister said.
	Several Sri Lankans living in New Zealand have accused the cricketers of serious misconduct, attending overnight parties till hours before the matches.
	They believed that they largely contributed to the disgraceful showing in the series. They also faulted the team management for not ensuring player discipline.
	Sri Lankas performances during the last twelve months have been disappointing to say the least. After making a premature exit from the Cricket World Cup, Sri Lanka suffered back to back defeats against Pakistan and India. They managed to beat West Indies at home, their biggest achievement in 2015.
	Sri Lankas next assignment is the Asia Cupa T20I tournament involving teams from the Asian continentbefore heading for India to defend the World T20 title which they won two years back in Bangladesh.
	Sri Lanka are also the defending Asia Cup champions.

They say that these onetime bigwigs had to invariably face a large portrait of a certain political leader hung on the wall of the office where they were being quizzed.
Meanwhile, a certain Betel leaf high up of the previous regime who incidentally is holding high office in yahapalanaya as well had to appear at this particular Police division to make a statement.
He also had to face the portrait of the political leader hanging on the wall while answering the questions put to him by the inquiring officer.
As soon as he had walked out after giving his statement, he had contacted a very high authority from the Blue party over his mobile phone.   I have come here on notice to make a statement. When they were questioning me, I had to answer all the time facing the portrait of this  of our own party. I hope you can imagine how embarrassing it was Therefore, kindly ask them either to shift this portrait elsewhere or do the questioning in another room
Soon after this call, the head of this inquiry office had received an order from a very high authority in yahapalanaya to move the portrait out. Now it adorns the wall elsewhere in the same building where it is no longer a disconcerting sight for the Betel leaf bigwigs summoned here for quizzing, they say.

The supporters were too many for one elevator and they had to ride to the fourth floor in the two elevators meant for Diyawanna members. The Diyawanna member who reached the fourth floor with one group of supporters found that the other group was still at the ground floor. And they had gone down to the ground floor to inquire about the delay. However, once at the ground floor, they found that the other group had again gone up to the fourth floor. So they had ridden back to the fourth floor to find the other group had come down to the ground floor again. In this manner, both groups had ridden up and down several times, but they had failed to meet for a reunion on the fourth floor.
Finally the Diyawanna member and his group waited on the ground floor for the other group, and soon they were all together again!
However, by now they had given up the idea of using the lift and taken the staircase together to reach the fourth floor.

Who wants him out for a duck
	
Now it is well known that the star willow wielder who was once offered a top diplomatic posting has become the whipping boy over the recent Enrique show-related tax evasion affair.
The question why the idol of the popular game was being relentlessly attacked over the tax affair was the main topic that figured at a discussion among a dozen of prominent political figures who attended a year-end party in the city. The political figures at this party had agreed that it was quite okay for the Municipal authorities to take necessary legal action against the organizers of the event if they had dodged payment of the entertainment levy, but there was no justification for making unceasing direct and indirect attacks on the star player.
The discussion had taken a different direction when one of the politicos had pointed out that the willow wielders name was being mentioned as being a likely runner for the main chair of the city at the local polls round the corner. And this bit of news set the others openly wondering whether the tax issue was being used by interested parties to have the star player out for a duck at the start of his political innings.

A consultant was appointed to a very high office of the government. This consultant is a veteran in politics who had held a number of high positions in the country. He is a good orator too. Born and bred in the hill country, he now lives in Colombo.
When he was appointed a consultant, he said he wanted a separate cubicle equipped with all amenities. And soon a quite comfortable room was made ready for him. However, the consultant said the room was still short of one important facility. Asked to name it he said: I want a VIP toilet for my exclusive use. And they soon provided that convenience too.
However, the cubicle thus constructed and furnished at a heavy cost remained closed for several months because the consultant did not turn up for work. Meanwhile, the employees of this office heard that the consultant had been given the walking papers.
The consultant had lost his job, they say, not because he failed to attend work, but because one of his sons had made his way into the good graces of the former strongman.
