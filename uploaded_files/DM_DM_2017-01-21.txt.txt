Authorities dispel alarm over (A) H1N1 outbreak
	
The recent death of three patients within a span of 48 hours at ward 69 of the Kandy Hospital forced a temporary closure of the ward, causing much alarm over a possible outbreak of a deadly virus. Hospital authorities suspected the patients had died of Influenza (A) H1N1. Two patients were reported to have succumbed to the virus while the third death was caused by an advanced stage of pneumonia. Taking immediate action, hospital authorities introduced swift measures to contain further spread of the virus within the hospital. 
Director of the Kandy Hospital Dr. Saman Ratnayake, speaking to the , said the patients in ward 69 were isolated as an emergency measure. The ward was not closed, the patients were temporarily isolated until the ward was sterilised, Dr. Ratnayake clarified, adding that the ward was reopened following its disinfection. Measures have also been implemented to halt the spread of the virus to other wards. 
Questioned about the number of patients diagnosed with the deadly virus, Dr. Ratnayake said at present 4 patients were identified as having been infected with the virus. The three female and one male patients who have tested positive for the virus are being monitored closely by authorities. Dr. Ratnayake who denied the possibility of the virus developing into epidemic levels, assured that the hospital and its staff were well equipped to manage and contain the virus. 
Influenza A (H1N1) virus emerged in 2009, with the World Health Organisation declaring the rapid spread of the disease a global pandemic. According to the WHO it is a new re-assortment that has never before circulated among humans. The disease, previously known as swine flu, is transmitted mainly through droplets disseminated by unprotected coughs and sneezes. Short-distance airborne transmission of influenza viruses may occur, particularly in crowded and enclosed spaces. Hand contamination and direct inoculation of virus is another possible source of transmission. Manifestations of H1N1 influenza are similar to those of the flu. Patients have symptoms of acute respiratory illness, including fever, cough, sore throat, body aches, headache, fatigue, diarrhea
and vomiting. The first death in Sri Lanka caused by H1N1 was reported in 2009. The victim, a 16-year-old boy, also from Kandy, succumbed to the virus while doctors believed that his immune system which had been compromised by other severe illnesses was more likely the cause of death. Since then, there have been a number of positive cases identified across several parts of the island with many fatalities reported. Nevertheless officials insist that the disease has thus far spread only in cluster stage over the past years. 
The also spoke to the Director General of Health Services Dr. Jayasundara Bandara, who ruled out the possibility of the spread of the H1N1 virus. We had a three year surveillance programme to monitor the prevalence of the disease. The virus has been highlighted in the public recently, following the unfortunate deaths reported at the Kidney ward of the Kandy hospital. However we have issued a circular in this regard in 2013, detailing how the virus must be tackled at state hospitals, Dr. Bandara said. 
The Director General of Health Services added that the disease is not a new phenomenon. We have observed the prevalence of the disease during the cold season, especially from September to February. The disease is known to have adverse effects on pregnant women, children and those who already have low immunity due to other health conditions. In such cases, the virus which is usually self- limiting and presents itself as a flu-like illness, can even develop to pneumonic stages. For a small percentage of patients, this may result in severe outcomes, Dr. Bandara explained. 
Asked of provisions employed for a possible outbreak of the virus, Dr. Bandara said hospitals had been provided with the necessary staff, knowledge and drugs, to counter such an escalation. Speaking of the situation at the Kandy Hospital, Dr. Bandara said the situation had been brought completely under control. However, he cautioned visitors to the hospital to take necessary precautions against seasonal influenza and added that visitors to the hospital must be controlled. 
Our attempts to contact the Infection Control Unit of the Kandy Hospital on numerous occasions failed. However, learned that the hospital staff was advised against divulging information pertaining to the disease and the deaths at ward 69 by hospital authorities. 
According to Dr. Samitha Ginige of the Epidemiology Unit, Ministry of Health, there have been no further developments reported in relation to the deaths at the Kandy Hospital. The condition is under control and there are no further developments. Officials have employed all necessary precautions to contain the disease, Dr. Ginige said. Asked if there were reports of clusters of the disease from other parts of the island, Dr. Ginige said an unusual number had not been reported thus far. Throughout the year, there are reports of a few patients having contracted the virus. This is not unusual. We cannot label such numbers as an outbreak because every year there is a slight increase of the number of patients diagnosed with the (A) H1N1 virus from the period between October to January, Dr Ginige added. 
Saying that there was no cause for alarm over an outbreak of the infectious agent, Dr. Ginige warned however that people should remain vigilant about symptoms of the virus such as continued flu symptoms and breathlessness. He added that such individuals should maintain good health and avoid crowds where they could be exposed to the risk of contracting the disease. The Health Ministry and the Epidemiology Unit have implemented all necessary measures in hospitals islandwide to address any possible outbreak of the disease, Dr. Ginige assured.

Magical Charisma of Kandy-Born Actor-Politico  M.G. Ramachandran (MGR)
	
anuary 17, 2017 was declared a holiday in the Southern Tamil Nadu State of India. This was to acknowledge and celebrate the birth centenary of Marudur Gopalan Ramachandran or MG Ramachandran who served as chief minister of Tamil Nadu for 10 years from 1977 to 1987. It is the political party he founded in 1972 -- the All India Anna-Dravida Munnetra Kazhagham -- that is in power today in the State. Various events were held throughout Tamil Nadu to honour the memory of a larger-than-life personality known to millions of people by three letters of the English alphabet denoting the initials of his names - MGR. 
MGR though ethnically a Malayalee made a name for himself as an actor in Tamil films and followed it up by becoming the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu State. MGR who started acting in minor roles from 1936 got his major break as lead actor in 1947. Thereafter for 30 years till 1977 he was the uncrowned king of Tamil cinema as the biggest box office attraction of them all. The swashbuckling actor starred as an action hero in more than 100 Tamil films. In a film career spanning four decades from 1936 to 1978, MGR acted in 136 films. Most of his movies minted money at the box-office. This was the time when the magical initials MGR was a household name in the Tamil-speaking homes of countries with a substantial population of Tamils, including India, Malaysia, Singapore and Sri Lanka. MGR had a huge following of fans in Sri Lanka during the time he sparkled on the silver screen. Among his fans in the Island were a large number of Sinhalese and Muslims too. 
MG Ramachandran also took to politics and was first appointed a member of the State upper house known as the Legislative Council in 1962. He was later elected as a member of the Legislative Assembly in 1967. Thereafter he was returned to the Lower House or Legislative Assembly in the state elections of 1971, 1977, 1980 and 1984. MGR became Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu in 1977 and remained undefeated till his death in 1987. MGRs life was a rags-to- riches tale that I have written about earlier. However it is a story worth re-relating on the occasion of Ramachandrans birth centenary. I shall strive to do so while relying on some of my earlier writings on the MGR phenomenon. 
Significantly enough a commemorative event was held in Jaffna too on January 17 to mark MGRs birth centenary. A number of Sri Lankan Tamil politicians were present at the commemoration. The chief guest was the Indian Consul-General in Jaffna, A. Natarajan. The Indian diplomat who is a native of Tamil Nadu described MGR as Sri Lankas gift to India because the popular actor-politico was born in Kandy. Natarajans observation about MGR being Lankas gift to India needs to be taken with a pinch of salt as Ramachandrans parents were not Sri Lankans but Indians staying temporarily in the Island. But the fact remains that MGR was born in Sri Lanka. 
Marudur Gopalamenon Ramachandar
MGR was born to Malayalee parents as Marudur Gopalamenon Ramachandar in Hantane, Kandy on January 17, 1917. His father, a native of the present day Kerala State in India, was at that time teaching in an estate school in Kandy. MGR, the youngest of the five children born to his parents, grew up in Kandy till he was two. In 1919 the family returned to India. 
MGRs family had been prosperous at one time but had later run into difficulties. MGRs father Gopalamenon (Menon denotes a caste suffix which MGR dispensed with later) was a magistrate serving in places like Trichur and Ernakulam. MGRs mother Sathyabhama was a not-so-well-educated housewife. There were five children in all. Four were born in India. They were two boys named Chakrapani and Balakrishnan and two girls named Kamalaatchi and Subathra. The youngest born in Sri Lanka was given the name Ramachander at birth. M.G. Ramachander later altered his name to Ramachandran. 
Three of the five children died in their infancy. Only the eldest Chakrapani born in 1911 and the youngest Ramachander born in 1917 survived. Meanwhile the magistrate-father fell into trouble over an ethical issue.
He was interdicted pending a disciplinary inquiry. A chagrined Gopalamenon resigned and sought fresh employment elsewhere. 
Sri Lanka during the period of British rule was a powerful magnet for many unemployed or underemployed people of South India. Thus Gopalan or Gopalamenon obtained a teaching job in the Island and moved to Kandy where Ramachander was born. However Gopalamenon fell ill and in 1919 returned to India with his family. They took up residence in a place called Othappaalam where Gopalan started tutoring children from rich families. 
Tragedy struck in 1920 as Gopalan passed away due to an illness when young MGR was only three and Chakrapani nine. The mother Sathyabhama then relocated to Kumbakonam where her brother Narayanans family was residing. Chakrapani continued his studies at the Aanaiaddy School in Kumbakonam. A few years later Ramachander also started going to the same school. 
Madurai Original Boys Company
Sathyabhama called Sathya struggled to bring up her two sons. She worked as a domestic servant doing cleaning in Brahmin homes. After awhile brother Narayanan suggested that Chakrapani should give up school and find work because of the familys precarious financial state. Narayanan himself was attached to the drama troupe Madurai Original Boys Company. The troupe specialised in staging plays with young boys as actors. Uncle Narayanan found a place for the nephew at the drama company as an actor. A few years later Ramachander also followed his elder brothers footsteps and joined the Boys Company. Both brothers toured many places as drama actors. 
Meanwhile the cinema industry began taking root in India. The silent movies gave way to talkies and film-making became a craze. Many film companies hired stage actors to act on screen also. Young Ramachander got his first chance in films when the film Sathi Leelavathy was made in 1936. The Director was Ellis R. Dungan, an American. MGR got a role playing a detectives role. He was only 19 at the time. MGR was paid Rs.100 in advance for the film, which he promptly sent to his mother Sathya. 
MGRs career as a film actor proceeded in fits and starts. Though he had the necessary looks, physique and martial arts skills required by an actor, MGR lacked a good singing voice. In those days the main actors had to sing in their own voices on screen. A Tamil film of yore had song sequences numbering double digits. The inability to sing deprived MGR of opportunities to act in lead or meaty roles. He had to be content with minor roles. MGR acted in only 20 films during the years 1936 to 1947 . His name was displayed as M.G. Ramachander in the titles then. 
The film song sphere in the Tamil movie world got a fillip in the forties of the last century. Instead of compelling actors to sing in their own voices, filmmakers introduced the art or craft of playback singing. The songs would be sung by reputed singers and recorded. The actors on screen would lip sync accordingly. Thereafter the sound track and film track would be synchronized accordingly via re-recording. This innovation enabled actors lacking singing talent to get main or lead roles in films. 

"MG Ramachandran also took to politics and was first appointed a member of the State upper house known as the Legislative Council in 1962. He was later elected as a member of the Legislative Assembly in 1967. Thereafter he was returned to the Lower House or Legislative Assembly in the state elections of 1971, 1977, 1980 and 1984"

Novelty Of Playback Singing
The novelty of playback singing was like manna from heaven to MGR. A noted singer, M.M. Maariyappah, began to voice for MGR in films. In later years singers like T.M. Soundararajan, Seergali Govindarajan, S.P. Balasubramaniam and K.J. Yesuthas voiced for MGR. T.M. Soundarajan is regarded as the best playback singer voice for MGR. 
M.G. Ramachandran was picked by Jupiter films to play the hero in the film Rajakumari (Princess). The Telugu actress Malini was the heroine. The vamp role was played by a Jaffna Tamil woman Thavamanidevi who made great waves in Tamil films those days. The buxom lass from Jaffna had no qualms in showing skin and was an overnight sensation. Rajakumari was a roaring success commercially. MGR now began getting more lead roles. In most films he played an action hero. Soon he became a popular actor whose films were box office hits. The magic initials MGR began garnering an incredible number of fans. 
Even as MGR was tasting triumph as an actor, tragedy struck. His mother Sathya passed away in 1950. Thereafter MGR began to treat his mother as a divine being and worshiped her portrait daily. He also named the studio he acquired as Sathya Studios and floated a movie production company called Sathya Movies. His residential estate in Ramaavaram was also called Sathya Thottam (Garden). 
The death of his mother was not the only blow suffered by MGR. He lost his first wife Paarkavi a.k.a. Thangamani in 1942 after two years of married life. His second wife Sathaananthavathi whom he married in 1943 was afflicted with tuberculosis and was bedridden for many years. She died in 1962. MGRs third wife was V.N. Janaki an actress herself. Cupids arrows pierced their hearts when they first acted together in the film Marutha Naattu Ilavarasi (Princess of Marutha Country). 
Though MGR and Janaki fell in love they could not get married formally as both were married to other persons. MGR was married to Sathaananthavathi and Janaki to another artiste named Ganapathy Bhatt. Janaki separated from Bhatt and filed for divorce. She obtained a divorce after protracted legal proceedings. She began living together with MGR from 1959 but could not marry him because his wife Sathaanandavathy was alive. It was only after her death in 1962 that Janaki and MGR got married legally in 1963. Janaki survived MGR and passed away in 1996. She also succeeded MGR as chief minister of Tamil Nadu for a brief period in 1988. 
Tamil Nadu Chief Minister
MGR acted in 116 films during the period from 1947 to 1978. He gave up acting in 1977 after he became Tamil Nadu Chief Minister. His last film Maduraiyai Meetta Sundarapaandiyan (Madurai Liberator Sundarapaandiyan) was released in 1978. MGR himself directed parts of the film and completed it after the Director B.R. Panthulu died before shooting was over. 
Twelve of MGRs films were silver jubilee hits running for over 25 weeks each. Another 68 films ran for more than 100 at theatres during their first screenings. Even the MGR films that did not run for a 100 days initially turned out to be money-spinners in the long run as each re-release brought large audiences to theatres. 
MGR had a formula of his own in the films he acted in. The story had to be sentimental with displays of mother-son love or brother-sister affection. Despite ups and downs and twists and turns, the good guy had to triumph in the end. Needless to say MGR was always the good guy except in a few films in the early stages of his career. The films had to have a positive message imparting a lesson to the people. The hero was regularly portrayed as a paragon of virtue who fights for justice on the side of the oppressed. The hero sings philosophical songs. Besides these features, a typical MGR film always had thrilling fight scenes and titillating love song sequences. MGR got the finest villain actors to play opposite him. 
Likewise MGR always had the loveliest actresses as his scintillating heroines on screen. Among actresses MGR paired with apart from Janaki were B.S. Saroja, Madhri Devi, Anjali Devi, Bhanumathy, Padmini, Vyjayanthimala, Saroja Devi, Savithri, Devika, Jamuna, Rajasulochana, K.R. Vijaya, Jayalalithaa, Vanishree, Lakshmi, Manjula, Latha and Radha Salujah. Of these stars, MGR has acted in the most number of films with Jayalalithaa as leading lady. It was well-known that MGR was infatuated with the alluring actress with whom he paired in 28 films. Though unmarried, Jayalalithaa was regarded as the love of MGRs life. 
MGR-Jayalalithaa Duo Was a Hot Pair
Jayalalithaas passport to success in the film world was her second Tamil film Aayirathil Oruvan (One Man in a Thousand) where she played leading lady to MGR. Despite the 32-year difference in age, the MGR-Jayalalithaa duo was a hot pair. Among their other successes were Chandrothayam, Muharasi, Kavalkaran, Thanipiravi, Olivilakku, Rahasiya Police 115, Adimai Penn, Maatukkaara Velan, Engal Thangam, Kumari Kottam, etc. MGRs last film with Jayalalithaa was Pattikkaattu Ponnaiyah (Village Rustic Ponnaiyah) made in 1973. 
There was a time when MGR in a movie called Thanipiravi (Unique Being) played Lord Muruga and Jayalalithaa his consort Valli in a dream sequence. A picture of both together as Murugan and Valli was framed and worshiped by many. According to some observers MGR had some kind of a foot-fetish for Jayalalithaa. In many of the films they acted together in, there were scenes of MGR touching Jayalalithaas feet like removing a thorn from her sole or massaging a sprained ankle. Apparently Jayalalithaas erstwhile leading man had a fixation for her feet. 
MGR himself underwent two transformations as his acting career blossomed. Firstly he changed his name to Ramachandran from Ramachander. Nevertheless it was as MGR that he was widely known. Secondly, he joined the ranks of the newly-formed Dravida Munnetra Kazhagham (DMK) led by C.N. Annadurai known as Anna or elder brother. 
In Tamil Nadu it was the DMK which first attempted to use cinema for political propaganda in the post-independence years. Annadurai had once said that if it took 10,000 political meetings to convey one message, it only took one single hit movie to deliver the same. He and his disciple Karunanidhi set out on that venture. Films scripted by Annadurai were well-received, and its political content made great impact. But it was Karunanidhi who really hit it big as a script-writer. 

"MGR became Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu. His followers who dubbed him earlier as Puratchi Nadigar or Revolutionary Actor now hailed him as Puratchy Thalaiver (Revolutionary Leader). MGR was elected Chief Minister again in 1980 and 1985 after his party won at the polls. He died in harness as Chief Minister in 1987"

Flowery And Fiery Prose Of Karunanidhi
Karunanidhi developed a writing style called Adukku Mozhi that was flowery and alliterative, and which soon became very popular. There were others to follow Karunanidhi in both content and style -- Aasaithamby, Krishnaswamy, Maaran (Karunanidhis nephew) and Kannadasan.The DMK also spawned a school of actors who could effectively mouth the lines of the script writers. One of the early greats was the comedian N.S. Krishnan who was followed by a host of Dravidian School actors like K.R. Ramaswamy, M.R. Radha, T.V. Narayanaswamy, S.S. Rajendran (SSR) and Sivaji Ganesan. The last two in particular were able to deliver the flowery and fiery prose of Karunanidhi with great conviction and style. 
Personal differences arose between Sivaji Ganesan and Karunanidhi, and the actor crossed over to the Congress. To make up for Ganesan, Karunanidhi, whose dialogues were increasingly getting political, weaned an actor from the Congress camp into the DMK fold. This was none other than M.G. Ramachandran. When the DMK began using actors for political propaganda, the Congress leader Kamaraj dimissed them derisively as Koothaadigal (performers). But the Congress had to soon change roles and rely on people like Sivaji Ganesan and lyricist-script writer Kannadasan who had crossed over from the DMK. 
Even as film stars were used for political propaganda, the film stars in turn were using politics for their personal advancement. M.G. Ramachandran himself began constructing and consolidating a personal political base. Even when he starred in films not written by DMK ideologues, the lines he delivered on screen carried hidden political meaning. An example was the constant reference to the morning sun (Udhaya Sooriyan), the DMK symbol. 
In colour productions, MGR would wear the party colours, black and red. He also sang songs on screen pledging sweeping social reforms that would remove socio-political inequalities. Gradually, MGRs screen persona started reflecting the DMKs image. The difference between reality and make-believe blurred, while he continued to pull crowds. As Annadurai once said of MGR,  Avar Sollukku pathu latcham. Avar Mugathukku muppathu latcham. (One million votes for his speech. Three million for his face.) 
Underdog Against Tyranny And Injustice
In his roles, MGR always fought for the underdog against tyranny and injustice. He took special care to project a social message in most songs, and took care to act in different roles so that different segments of the population could relate to and identify with him. The movies, titled simply but astutely, in which he played lead roles include Padagotti (Boatman), Meenava Nanban (Fisherman Friend), Thoilaali (Worker), Vivasayee (Agriculturist), Rickshawkaran (Rickshawalla) and so on. These occupational groups began treating MGR as one of their own. So powerful and lasting has been the MGR legacy that, decades after his death, the crowds cheer madly at the mere mention of his name at election meetings in Tamil Nadu. 
A unique feature of the relationship between the movie stars of the Indian south and their fans was the proliferation of fan clubs. These clubs would hold special poojas in temples whenever a new movie of their matinee idol was released. Milk would be poured on cut-outs of actors and camphor lit. M.G. Ramachandran probably encouraged the phenomenon of fan clubs from late 1940s onwards, and the clubs ended up as a well-knit federation that counted its membership in the millions. The clubs held annual conventions and also participated in social service projects. When MGR entered active politics, his fan clubs were in turn politicised and soon became an indispensable component of the DMK propaganda machine. In MGRs case both spheres mutually reinforced each other  film popularity providing political mileage and political positions strengthening film popularity. 
It was not long before MGR was rewarded with political office. MGR was made first an Upper House member of the state legislature. Later he contested the State Assembly elections directly and won continually in each election from 1967 to 1984 until his death in 1987. The DMK formed the administration in Madras state re-named by the party as Tamil Nadu. The popularity of MGR within the DMK party and Tamil Nadu state caused major convulsions. In a bid to counteract the phenomenon, Karunanidhi encouraged his son M.K. Muthu to enter movies. The father, while in office as Chief Minister, wrote the story and dialogue for Muthus first film Pillaiyo Pillai (Oh, What a Son). Muthu fan clubs were set up overnight, with father Karunanidhis backing. 
MGR, realising what was in store, engineered a split within the party in 1972 on the grounds of corruption charges against the incumbent regime. Incidentally, MGR did not have any problems in setting up new party structures -- he merely converted his fan clubs into party branches. The MGR phenomenon was no doubt unique, and his mystique continues its hold over the Tamil psyche even today. Before his death, he had come to personify the aspirations of the common people but as more than just a symbol. As political leader, he was also seen as a vehicle for realising their dreams. 

"The novelty of playback singing was like manna from heaven to MGR. A noted singer, M.M. Maariyappah, began to voice for MGR in films. In later years singers like T.M. Soundararajan, Seergali Govindarajan, S.P. Balasubramaniam and K.J. Yesuthas voiced for MGR.
T.M. Soundarajan is regarded as the best playback singer voice for MGR"

All- India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagham
MGR formed the Anna-Dravida Munnetra Kazhagham (ADMK) after splitting from the DMK in 1972. In forming his new party MGR retainined the name of DMK with an added prefix - Anna derived from the DMK founder -leader C.N. Annadurai popularly called Anna.MGR later amended the Anna-DMK to AIADMK or All-India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagham. MGR incurred much mirth among political pundits when he stated that his party ideology was a blend of capitalism, socialism and communism. He called it Annaism after Annadurai as in the instances of Marx -marxism or Mao - Maoism.MGR had the last laugh on his detractors when his party romped home as winners in 1977. 
MGR became Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu. His followers who dubbed him earlier as Puratchi Nadigar or Revolutionary Actor now hailed him as Puratchy Thalaiver (Revolutionary Leader). MGR was elected Chief Minister again in 1980 and 1985 after his party won at the polls. He died in harness as Chief Minister in 1987. Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi bestowed upon him posthumously the Bharat Ratna which is the highest civilian honour in India. 
MGRs involvement with the politics of Sri Lankan Tamils was extremely interesting. MGR was reluctant as an actor to identify himself with the Sri Lankan Tamil cause at one point because he did not want to risk offending his Sinhala fans in the Island. He openly stated so in a meeting in London in 1973 and aroused the ire of Sri Lankan Tamils present. The very same MGR later transformed into a strong supporter of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam(LTTE)led by Veluppillai Prabhakaran after BBlack Julyin 1983. He even went to the extent of openly providing crores of cash to the tigers. MGRs convoluted understanding of Sri Lankan Tamil politics and his complex relationship with the LTTE requires a more detailed analysis on another occasion. 

Jayalalithaa Was MGRs Political Heir
After MGRs demise on December 24, 1987, his wife Janaki succeeded him as Chief Minister for a brief spell of 24 days in January 1988. MGRs party fragmented into two with Janaki leading one faction and Jayalalithaa the other. Later Janaki bade adieu to politics and both factions united under MGRs former leading lady. Jayalalithaa led MGRs party to victory in the elections of 1991, 2001, 2011 and 2016. Jayalalithaa, symbolised the transition from the MGR era to the present. It was MGR who had, as Chief Minister, inducted Jayalalithaa into politics. She was hailed as MGRs political heir and was called Puratchi Thalaivi  the feminine equivalent of Revolutionary Leader. It has been said in lighter vein that MGR was the only Tamil Nadu Chief Minister whose wife as well as paramour succeeded him. Jayalalithaa passed away unexpectedly in December last year. O. Pannerselvam was sworn in as chief minister of the AIADMK administration. 
This then is the story of MGR  the Malayalee actor-politico  who reigned supreme in Tamil Nadu for more than 40 years in both cinema and politics. MGR ruled Tamil movies as the most popular and commercially successful matinee idol hero for 30 years. He followed it up as an electorally invincible Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu for 10 consecutive years. The life of the man known as MGR has indeed been an outstanding journey along the highways of cinema and politics in Tamil Nadu. And it all began 100 years ago at Hantane in Kandy on January 17, 1917.

No conditions attached to GSP: UNP
	
Sri Lanka's 2500-year-old Buddhist culture is non-negotiable for whatever reasons, even if it were to gain the GSP+ or any other benefit, two United National Party ( UNP) back-benches said yesterday.
These views were expressed by UNP MPs Harshana Rajakaruna and Wijepala Hettiarachchi at a media briefing last morning.
They said legalizing homosexuality or any other step which diluted Sri Lanka's rich culture would never happen.
Mr Rajakaruna said the division of the country was also out of the question and that the government had not agreed to any condition that would lead to the division of the country.
He said the real situation with regard to GSP+ is that there were no conditions involved in re-gaining it. The European Union had only requested that Sri Lanka ratify and implement 27 international conventions, to which the successive governments had agreed to in the past, he sad.(Yohan Perera)

Over 200 arrested at Trump inauguration protests in Washington
	
Six police officers were injured and 217 protesters arrested Friday after a morning of peaceful protests and coordinated disruptions of Donald Trump's inauguration ceremony gave way to ugly street clashes in downtown Washington.
At least two DC police officers and one other person were taken to the hospital after run-ins with protesters, DC Fire Spokesman Vito Maggiolo told CNN.
Acting DC Police Chief Peter Newsham said the officers' injuries were considered minor and not life threatening.
Bursts of chaos erupted on 12th and K streets as black-clad "antifascist" protesters smashed storefronts and bus stops, hammered out the windows of a limousine and eventually launched rocks at a phalanx of police lined up in an eastbound crosswalk. Officers responded by launching smoke and flash-bang devices, which could be heard from blocks away, into the street to disperse the crowds.
"Pepper spray and other control devices were used to control the criminal actors and protect persons and property," police said.
Anti-Trump protests also broke out Friday in US cities, including New York, Seattle, Dallas, Chicago and Portland, Oregon. Authorities in Seattle say one person was in critical condition at a hospital with a gunshot wound. Demonstrations also took place overseas in Hong Kong, Berlin and London.
In Washington, Newsham told CNN the several hundred demonstrators who actively confronted police were vastly outnumbered by the thousands of nonviolent protesters who swarmed the nation's capital for Inauguration Day and Saturday's Women's March on Washington.
"We have been pointing out all along that this is a very isolated incident, and by and large, everything is going peacefully and a lot of folks have come to the city to enjoy this historic day, not only the Capitol but walking all around the city," he said.
But many protesters, including permitted marchers, accused security personnel of denying them access to their planned routes. (CNN)

PPPD to be set up to attract Foreign Direct Investment
	
In the wake of the unity governments effort to attract Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) and diversify loss-making state ventures, two strategic ministries, Finance and Development Strategies and International Trade, are in the process of setting up a novel Public-Private-Partnership Division (PPPD) to carry out programmes relating to diversification and FDIs.
The Cabinet Committee on Economic Management and the Cabinet have given the green light to go ahead with the establishment of the PPPD at an estimated cost of Rs.75 million.
A joint cabinet memo by Ministers Ravi Karunanayaka and Malik Samarawickrama says that a PPP refers to a contractual arrangement between the implementing agency and the project proponent for the financing, design, construction, operation and maintenance or any combination thereof and any project or facility, which in alignment with national priority and economic agenda where the proponent bears significant risk and management responsibility or both.
The setting up and operating a PPPD housed in the Treasury, recruiting personnel with commercial and technical expertise will be the first step of leveraging the maximum number of solicited and unsolicited proposals submitted for PPPs, the memo says.
The necessity for a Central Division has arisen for assisting, advising and facilitating the activities of PPP projects.
It said the main objectives expected to be achieved through a PPPD are, managing project selection and implementation, providing project transaction advice, and PPP cells will be organized in the relevant ministries to handle the work as well as to liaise with the PPPD.
The primary role of this division to be established would be to provide oversight, transparency, good governance, the formulation of policies and recommendations to the Cabinet Committee on Economic Management.
The proposed structure will initially comprise 17 personnel who will be recruited on a 3-year contract with the option for renewal. (Sandun A. Jayasekera)

SriLankan airlines: Govt. identifies US Co. for PPP project
	
The government has identified a Unites States-based company to share in the SriLankan airlines equity under the proposed Private Public Partnership (PPP) model, Public Enterprise Development Deputy Minister Eran Wickramaratne said yesterday.
Initially, the government had short-listed three prospective investors for this project.
He said a committee comprising ministry secretaries had identified one of the companies for further engagement. However, the deputy minister said the selected company was not a traditional airline operator.
It is a private equity company that has invested in airlines for decades. But not an airline operator. The committee has recommended this company for further discussions, he said. The government has proposed the PPP model to revitalize some of the loss-making state institutions. The deputy minister said the government would retain a majority stake in these ventures.

## Title: Universitys Loss was the Industrys Gain

Universitys Loss was the Industrys Gain
	
On July 22, 1970, while walking along the upper corridor of the Chemistry Department at Peradeniya, a tall undergraduate saw bottles of Nitrobenzene being shifted from the store by a lab attendant, through the closed windows of the laboratory. This happened to be the day prior to the SSQ practical examination at Peradeniya for the Special Chemistry batch. The undergraduate crept into the library to read Vogels organic Chemistry Practical manual and immediately contacted the rest of his batchmates for a discussion. He was certain of the upcoming practical the following day and informed all his batchmates of the expected reaction, the difficulty of getting the intermediate product and how to face the practical Examination successfully the following day. 
That was Ranjith Guruge who had the ability and sincerity to convince and share his knowledge with his colleagues without jealousy or competition, unlike most other undergraduates of the day. He was intelligent and had the ability to grasp the subject by listening and reading. He was not a bookworm but had a great deal of imagination and a vast knowledge of the finer points of practical chemistry. He had the ability to find solutions to difficult chemical reactions and had gotten the opportunity in a foreign University research team he would have gone into new inventions. If not for his extracurricular activities, he would have ended up as a brilliant University Don. However, the Universitys loss was the industrys gain. 
It has been nearly five weeks since Ranjith passed away, finally losing his battle with the dreaded cancer he suffered from during the last two years. 

"At the faculty, he was very interested in the welfare of students."
I have associated with him for almost fifty years since my school days at Mahinda College, Galle and at the University of Peradeniya as batchmates and later in life as a close friend. I wish to pen down this appreciation as a mark of tribute to a brilliant Chemist, innovator and socio-political analyst with a clear vision. I certainly miss our long telephone conversations on the current socio-political events in Sri Lanka and rest of the world. 
Ranjith Talpe Guruge was born in Sitinamaluwa in the Beliatta electorate as the eldest child of late Mr. and Mrs. T.G. Sirisena, landed proprietors and rice mill owners. He received his primary and secondary education at St Servatius College, Matara, Mahinda College and Richmond College, Galle. At the University of Peradeniya, he graduated with a special degree in Chemistry and later successfully obtained a Masters of Business Administration from the Post-Graduate Institute of Management of the University of Sri Jayawardenapura. 
He married Doctor Kalyani Gomes in 1978 and was the father of three wonderful children, two sons and a daughter. He was very happy that all three children studied well and became qualified as independent professionals. Kalyani and the children supported him and looked after him during his final two years as a united family. He was really lucky to have such a dedicated wife and children. 
After a short stint as a Demonstrator at the Chemistry Department of the University of Peradeniya in 1973, Ranjith spent one year as a Chemistry teacher at Nalanda College, Colombo. In 1975 he joined the Ceylon Steel Corporation as a Research Officer and showed early signs of brilliant chemical innovation in producing Iron Oxide pigments, a by-product of waste from the steel production process. At that time, with import restrictions, the corporation had a ready market for the pigments manufactured by his technique derived from locally designed and assembled equipment. However, with the removal of import restrictions by the J.R. Jayawardene administration, this product lost the market. At the same time, Ranjith left the Steel Corporation for greener pastures as a Paint Chemist with Ceylon Paint Industries. Subsequently, he joined Masons Mixtures Ltd under Browns Group where he served as Production Manager till August 1983, when Ranjith was given the opportunity as Resident Manager in charge of the Rice Bran Oil Plant of Unilever in Minneriya. Later he shifted to the Unilever head office and sharpened his knowledge in the fine techniques of soap and toothpaste production which stood in good stead during the latter part of his career as a Technical Consultant to Swadeshi Industries, Antler Group and Link Natural Products to name a few. He initiated his own soap manufacturing operation in a factory he established at Kurunegala, which he operated even during the final stages of his life while bedridden. Ranjith Guruge practically never retired from his professional life until his untimely death. 

However, Ranjith will be best remembered by many of us for his student activities at the University of Peradeniya, where he was sometimes the most hated and sometimes the most loved student by his colleagues, as well as seniors and juniors, in all faculties during the 1968-1972 period. 
Since our first year, we were involved in student politics, whether in the Science or Arts Faculty. The JVP affiliated Samajawadi Sangamaya tried to capture power by opposing them. Guruge should be remembered for the contribution he made during the crucial Arts faculty Election in 1969 when we managed to put forward Ranjith Samaranayaka as a common front candidate against Somasiri Kumanayaka of the JVP. 
He was also engaged in SLFP politics in Kandy, working closely with late Hector Kobbekaduwa, G.B. de Silva, Anurudhdha Ratwatte, Monty Gopallawa and D.M. Jayaratna in their respective electorates during the 1970 elections. At the faculty, he was very interested in the welfare of students. When he represented the Science Students Union as a committee member, he was instrumental in opening a better canteen for the students. He was also very interested in national harmony and had good relations with Tamil students. 
In fact, when he received an opportunity to participate in third-year industrial training, he opted to go to Paranthan Chemicals Corporation. He recall the time he spent with Tamil workers during weekends with nostalgia. In fact, later in his life, with his association with the Tamil weekly, Janavegam, he would visit the north and east with N. Shanmugaratnam and B. Sriskandadas, two prominent senior Tamil student leaders. 
He would visit Karainagar often, due to his close association with late V. Ratai, working with the minority Tamil population in the north, the Harijans. 
As an industrial chemist, he imparted his knowledge to anyone who sought his advice and spent several hours in libraries to upgrade his knowledge on modem developments. He was talented in utilizing used and discarded equipment to produce the products he wanted to manufacture. Whenever he travelled abroad, he visited closed factories and purchased used equipment, which he brought to Sri Lanka and assembled to meet his requirements. He was a versatile man who imagined things beyond the ordinary. In fact, Mr. Ananda Jayasinghe, Chairman Antler group told me at his funeral that, even during the last few months of his life he was planning on expanding his soap manufacturing activities. 
Ranjith was socially involved in the Peradeniya University Alumni Colombo Chapter from the inception. He never missed our batch get-togethers and used to be in touch with colleagues and friends through telephone and social media. He had a photographic memory and would talk about various past incidents. Im sure that to most of our friends, his early death was a shock. He was very well looked after by his family during his illness in the latter stage of his life. He probably knew his plight and was expecting the inevitable. During the last stages of his life, he was engaged in meditation under the influence of a Bhikku he used to associate with and was a Dayaka of Mettarama temple at Bambalapitiya. I hope and pray that Ranjith will not suffer in future lives and attain the supreme bliss of Nibbana. Friends of Ranjith Guruge, at the initiation of Dr. Athula Attygalle, have decided to launch a scholarship programme in his memory to a deserving Chemistry undergraduate as a mark of respect.
