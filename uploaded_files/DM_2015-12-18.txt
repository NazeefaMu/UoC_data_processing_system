TU action if demands not granted soon: Ratnapriya
	
Government, semi Government and private sector Trade Unions Collective Convener Saman Ratnapriya said yesterday they would resort to trade union action if the government failed to fulfill its promises made at the meeting with Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.
He said the government had agreed to grant 11 of 12 demands made by them and this was why the collective had called its scheduled countrywide token strike.
The government has a responsibility to fulfill its promises without any delay and not force us to take trade union action, he said.
Mr. Ratnapriya rejected the claims by some people that they had betrayed the trade union action but it was nothing unusual to call off trade union action when 60 per cent of the demands were achieved. We have gone beyond that limit, he said.

Vehicle permits; Complaint lodged with FCID
	
The All Ceylon Customs Services Union (ACCSU) yesterday complained to the Financial Crime Investigation Division (FCID) about a Rs.1 billion fraud on vehicles imported on permit.
It said the fraud had taken place at the Customs when it released vehicles imported on permits and thus evading taxes.
ACCSU General Secretary J.A. Gunathilake alleged that this racket had been carried out by a several finance companies and individuals when importing luxury vehicles such as BMWs from Japan valued at more than US$75,000 USDs using vehicle permits given to state sector employees.
The permit only allows an employee to import a vehicle valued at less than US$35,000. Most of our state employees dont have the funds to import a vehicle even on a permit. Therefore, some companies purchase these permits for a lesser amount and use the permits to import luxury vehicles, he said.
Mr. Gunathilake said these companies also receive a concession on the declared a value of less than US$35,000 when importing the vehicles. He said the companies pay about Rs.1.6 million to the Customs instead of the actual taxes that needed to be paid.
These underhand tactics result in the government losing billions of rupees as Government revenue. The then president and finance minister Mahinda Rajapaksa gave a ruling that anyone can import vehicles from the permits given to state employees. Recently, the finance companies which imported vehicles on permits had influenced Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayke through a ministry secretary to get their imported vehicles released evading customs levies, Mr. Gunathilake said adding that the Customs Director General had taken measures to release such vehicles on the minsters orders.
He said they had complained to the President, Prime Minister and the Finance Minister but there had been no response from them.
This is why we came to the FCID, he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Health Minister should ask himself why he was afraid of quitting the Mahinda Rajapaksa government until President Maithripala Sirisena did so to join the coalition against the then government, the Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) said today.
Responding to a question asked by a journalist at a media briefing, GMOA spokesman Dr. Navin de Soysa said they were never scared of former defense secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa or any politician in the country and never sucked up to them.
He said that during a discussion, President Sirisena had admitted that the GMOA was not an association which had any political agendas even though some politicians had criticized the GMOA . (Piyumi Fonseka)

How will TNA solve the problem of Northern Chief Minister Wigneswaran
	
How do you solve a problem like Maria
How do you catch a cloud and pin it down
How do you find the word that means Maria
A flibbertijibbet! A will-o-the wisp! A clown!
Many a thing you know youd like to tell her
Many a thing she ought to understand
But how do you make her stay and listen to all you say
How do you keep a wave upon the sand
Oh, how do you solve a problem like Maria
How do you hold a moonbeam in your hand
        - Oscar Hammerstein in Sound of Music.

By D.B.S. JeyarajVeteran Indian Journalist P.K.Balachandran who has been resident in Sri Lanka for many years has over the years acquired a remarkable insight into the politics and politicians of the Island known once as the pearl of the Indian ocean . Bala as he is known filed a perceptive news report in the New Indian Express last week about Northern province chief minister C.V.Wigneswaran that also quoted a few lines from the article written by this columnist in the Daily Mirror of December 12th 2015. The relevant news report reproduced from the New Indian Express is as follows :
Super Power United States as well as Regional Power India are none too happy with the political conduct of C.V.Wigneswaran, the Chief Minister of Sri Lankas Tamil-majority Northern Province.
US and Indian envoys have directly conveyed to him their concern that his unhelpful and radical posturing could jeopardize the Lankan governments bid to find an amicable solution to the long-standing Tamil question.
Last Thursday, Indian High Commissioner Y.K.Sinha met Wigneswaran and urged him not to split the moderate Tamil National Alliance (TNA) but instead cooperate with the leaders of the TNA such as R.Sampanthan, M.A.Sumanthiran and Mavai Senathirajah in engaging the Lankan government to find a solution to the Tamil problem when there is light at the end of the tunnel.
Wigneswaran told Sinha that differences within the TNA could be solved through talks, but it was apparent that the gap was wide, if not unbridgeable.
He vehemently justified his opposition to the Sirisena-Wickremesinghe government and to the TNA leaderships reposing faith in it.
Earlier on November 23, Samantha Power, the US Ambassador to the UN, met Wigneswaran in Jaffna and trashed his argument that the new regime in Colombo has not done anything for the Tamils. According to D.B.S.Jeyaraj, Wigneswaran had to revise his stand somewhat after Power demolished his case with an 11-point rebuttal. After the meeting, Power tweeted: Urged Jaffna Chief Minister C.V.Wigneswaran to help reinforce precious moment for reconciliation and re-building.
Powers tweet after meeting TNA chief Sampanthan was of a noticeably different kind. She described the moderate Tamil leader as a passionate voice of Tamil rights seeking results by building national consensus.She was pleased with the progress made by Lanka under the new government led by President Maithripala Sirisena. She said she was honoured to meet Sirisena who is committed to reconciliation, democracy, reform, justice. The ranking US diplomat described Foreign Minister Mangala Samaraweera as a friend who is a firm advocate of the rights of the Sri Lankan people, accountable government and reform.
Despite expressions of concern from influential quarters, Wigneswaran is unlikely to give up his radical posture because he has been led to believe that he can take on the TNA with the help of the people and the support of the pro-LTTE Tamil Diaspora. He is said to be under the influence of forces which believe that the Lankan Tamils can do without India and perhaps even the US.
Wigneswaran could therefore either try and capture the TNA or adopt existing friendly organizations like the Tamil United Liberation Front (TULF) and the Tamil National Political Front (TNPF). Political circles expect him to act before the local bodies elections in April 2016.
However, the TNAs leaders are unfazed. Sampanthan threw the gauntlet when he said in Batticaloa: If the party and the people want it, I will step down in favour of Wigneswaran. He is not walking away.
According to Sumanthiran, Wigneswarans claims of a mass following are hollow. His real strength was seen in the August 17 parliamentary elections. The TNA swept the polls without his support. The TNPF, which he indirectly supported, came a cropper, Sumanthiran observedPolitical Conduct of Northern Province Chief Minister
Balachandrans report as well as my column last week have focused on what has now become the major problem threatening the unity of the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) which is the premier political configuration of the Sri Lankan Tamils. The problem is none other than the political conduct of Northern Province chief minister Canagasabapathy Visvalingam Wigneswaran who was elected on the TNA ticket under the house symbol of chief TNA constituent party Ilankai Thamil Arasu Katchi (ITAK) with over 132,000 preference votes at the September 21st 2013 Provincial poll.
Decades ago when Sri Lanka was known as Ceylon, the YMCA in Colombo organized a lecture on the theme of Problems facing Independent Ceylon. Solomon West Ridgeway Dias Bandaranaike (SWRDB) then a minister in the cabinet of DS Senanayake was the guest speaker. The lecture was presided over by the YMCA forum speaker Anandatissa de Alwis who later went on to become speaker of both the National State Assembly and Parliament of Sri Lanka. The irrepressible Anandatissa known for his impish wit brought the house down when he introduced SWRD as the person best suited to speak on the problems facing Ceylon because many felt that SWRD Bandaranaike was the biggest problem facing Independent Ceylon then.SWRD was not amused.
Likewise it may be said in  lighter vein that if someone were to organize a lecture on the topic of problems facing the Tamil National Alliance then the most suitable person to speak on the subject  would be  Canagasabapathy Visvalingam Wigneswaran  because many feel CV Wigneswaran is the biggest problem facing the TNA right now. The political conduct of the Northern chief minister has caused many in the TNA to wring their hands in despair and cry out like the Sound of Musicnuns about Maria - How do you solve a problem like WigneswaranFormer Supreme court judge C.V.Wigneswaran was nominated by the ITAK as the chief ministerial candidate of the TNA for the Northern Provincial Council elections of September 2013. The ITAK was the chief constituent of the five party TNA at that time. Subsequently the other TNA constituents endorsed Wigneswarans candidacy and declared him to be the common candidate of the TNA. The TNA won 30 of 38 seats at the provincial poll and Wigneswaran topping with over 132,000 preferences. CV Wigneswaran was sworn in as the first Northern province chief minister in October 2013.Wigneswaran Acquired New Found Political Courage
Wigneswaran however has subsequently struck out on an errant course with an agenda of his own that has been at variance with the TNA in general and the ITAK in particular. Political observers have noted that Wigneswaran acquired new found political courage after the defeat of Mahinda Rajapaksa at the Presidential elections of Jan 8 2015. President Maithripala Sirisena replaced Northern Governor Gen. Chandrasiri with ex  diplomat HMGS Palihakkara. Earlier the chief minister and Governor had been at loggerheads with each other and Wigneswaran complaining that Chandrasiri was not allowing him to administer the province freely.
After Chandrasiris removal the chief minister began embarking on a deviant political course that was suspected of being influenced by extremist elements in the Global Tamil Diaspora. The chief minister defied the ITAK leadership by presenting two resolutions in the Northern council that aroused political controversy. One called for a UN probe into the alleged genocide of Tamils in Sri Lanka and the other demanded an international and not domestic investigation into the alleged acts of war crime perpetrated by the Colombo Govt during the final phase of the war. Both resolutions embarrassed the ITAK/TNA hierarchy greatly.Wigneswaran has also been making public utterances critical of the TNA leadership and some MPs. He has made unsubstantiated charges of corruption against unnamed MPs of the TNA.Wigneswaran also refused to campaign for the TNA at the Parliamentary election saying he was non  partisan. Adding insult to injury the chief minister issued two public statements with a veiled appeal that people should vote for the Tamil National Peoples Front(TNPF) The TNPF though strongly backed by the tiger and pro-tiger Diaspora elements fared miserably at the elections.
The controversial conduct of Wigneswaran especially his overt refusal to canvass for TNA and the covert support extended to the TNPF has infuriated a large number of TNA parliamentarians and provincial councillors. They have demanded that action should be taken immediately against Wigneswaran. Some have even urged his removal as chief minister.The ITAK hierarchy however has refused to be stampeded into action and analysed the situation in depth. Thereafter a three phase strategy has been devised to deal with the chief ministers indiscipline and solve the Wigneswaran problem.Three Phased Political Strategy Proposed by TNA/ITAK
A three member delegation comprising Leader of the Opposition and Tamil National Alliance(TNA) leader R.Sampanthan , the ITAK President and Jaffna district MP Maavai Senathirajah ITAK secretary and Eastern Provincial council minister Thurairajasingham is planning to meet chief minister Wigneswaran shortly and seek to iron out differences with him. The envisaged meeting is the first stage of the proposed three phased political strategy.
Efforts are to be made during these discussions to make Wigneswaran recognize his mistakes and repent. If that happens Wigneswaran will be let off with a gentle admonition. A statement would be issued saying there are no differences within the TNA and blame will be apportioned to the media and AntiTamil traitors for trying to cause divisions.
If these discussions do not bear fruit or if Wigneswaran subsequently renegades on his Good behaviours pledge , the second phase of the strategy would come into play. Plans would be drawn up to re-structure the Northern Provincial administration and re-invigorate it. The chief minister would be requested by the ITAK hierarchy to resign his office Voluntarily. It would be stated that Wigneswaran had agreed to serve as chief minister for only two years and that he was now quiting his post on his own. Wigneswaran would be given a rousing farewell and retired to pasture amiably without the ex-judge having to lose face.
If Wigneswaran is not amenable to this golden handshakeoption the third phase of the strategy would come into play. Stern action would be taken to remove him from his post. A no confidence motion would be passed by TNA provincial councillors against the chief minister who would be asked to resign.A resolution urging Governor Palihakkara to recommend the chief ministers removal to President Sirisena would also be made. Simultaneously the ITAK would hold a disciplinary inquiry against Wigneswaran and pass strictures against him.
Though the ex  supreme court judge could always resist his removal from office by resorting to courts the ITAK hierarchy opines that Wigneswaran would not enter into an undignified and protracted legal wrangle. The hierarchy is optimistic for now that Wigneswaran would be enlightened enough to see the error of his ways and engage in a course correction that would be mutually beneficial to both the party as well as himself. Some however are not so sure.New Tamil Political Configurtion Under TULF Aegis
Though a meeting between the chief minister and leadership of the ITAK/TNA has been on the cards for a long time the proposed meeting has not materialised so far. One reason for this is the consternation that has set in amidst the ITAK leadership about the suspected hidden agenda of Wigneswaran. Compounding the situation further has been the larger than life image of Wigneswaran being created by sections of the Tamil media in Sri 
	Lanka and abroad. It is suspected that if the ITAK tries to discipline Wigneswaran the chief minister will break away from the TNA and form a new Tamil political configuration under the aegis of the Tamil United Liberation Front(TULF) symbol of sun. It may be recalled that TULF Leader Veersasingham Aanandasangaree extended an open invitation to Wigneswaran to take over his party and symbol. It is being portrayed through the media that a very large number of Tamils are backing Wigneswaran. This is similiar to what the Tamil media did in the Parliamentary poll.Media inspired illusions of a TNPF denting the TNA were shattered. The TNPF with Wigneswarans indirect support was decisivey routed in all districts of the North and East.
Moreover the ITAK leadership is also wary of how many members of the TNA may break away with Wigneswaran if a break occurs. Though it is felt by many that notwithstanding pro-Wigneswaran projections by sections of the media only a few TNA members would opt to back the ex judge if and when a party split becomes inevitable. It is also felt that despite a bloated media illusion the vast majority of the Tamil people would not throw in their lot with the extremist policies of Wigneswaran. The August 17th Parliamentary poll in which the hawkish Gajendrakumar Ponnambalam covertly backed by Wigneswaran suffered a resounding defeat lends more credence to this opinion. TNA leader Sampanthans declaration in Batticaloa that he will step down if the party and people wanted Wigneswaran is a clear illustration of this confidence.However the veterans Sampanthan and Senathirajah are comparatively more responsible than the rash and impulsive Wigneswaran whose political conduct at times is akin to an elephant running amok in a potterry boutique. Even if confident of the final outcome in a political clash with Wigneswaran, the TNA/ITAK leaders are pragmatic enough to realise that a political split at this juncture would be detrimental to the long term interests of the TNA as a party and the Tamils as a people. This assessment is shared by India which is why Indian envoy YK Sinha emphasised unity to Wigneswaran in Jaffna.Hence the TNA leaders would tread cautiously in dealing with Wigneswaran .The coming weeks and months are likely to witness a cold war of the Thamizhian variety between Wigneswaran and the TNA/ITAK leadership. This political struggle is likely to crystallize into concrete confrontation at the forthcoming local authority polls.Promoted by TNA Leader Rajavarothayam Sampanthan
The irony in this situation is that Wigneswaran was at one time promoted by TNA leader Rajavarothayam Sampanthan as an ideal panacea to the political issues facing the Sri Lankan Tamils in general and the Tamil National Alliance in particular. Instead of being an asset of great utility as envisaged by Sampanthan the retired supreme court judge has turned into a liability of grave proportions. Wigneswaran was expected to administer the Northern provincial council on the one hand and be an able political deputy to Sampanthan and strengthen the TNA on the other. Instead what has happened is that Wigneswaran has virtually let the Northern council be converted into a white elephant on the one hand and let himself be turned into a destructive weapon threatening the unity of the TNA and undermining Sampanthans leadership on the other.
Many explanations and justifications have been trotted out by Wigneswaranistas for this sorry state of affairs. These range from the glib clash between confrontational and conciliatory approaches theory to the inability of Wigneswaran as a person of integrity to compromise on issues affecting the well-being of the Tamil nation rationalisation. However the crux of the matter is that CV Wigneswaran is currently perceived by many as a puppet in the hands of extremist sections of the global Tamil Diaspora. Those holding the puppet strings are suspected of being Diaspora elements faithful to the ideology and objectives of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam(LTTE). Proving the charge of genocide and bringing about the collapse of the Northern Provincial council are the twin objectives of the LTTE and pro-LTTE diaspora. Wigneswaran has been raising the cry of genocide and undermining the provincial council in recent times.
If this surmise about Wigneswaran being a feline puppet  is correct then the question that arises is how and why this turn occurred. Who or what brought about this turn or turned WigneswaranHow and why did this turnaround occur A brief excursion into Wigneswarans entry into Tamil politics and his baptism of fire in the Northern provincial polls of 2013 seemingly indicates that the foundation of this political transformation was laid during the provincial election campaign in 2013. These issues and other related matters will be delved into in a future article(ENDS)D.B.S.Jeyaraj can be reached at dbsjeyaraj@yahoo.com

Import of 700 luxury vehicles; Ravi denies reports
	
Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake today denied reports that 700 vehicles had been undervalued had ordered to be released from Customs without levying the actual import duty.
He told Parliament that those who had imported these vehicles were asked to pay a duty surcharge of 35 per cent.
The minister said the Government had also taken steps to stop the release of containers carrying undervalued goods until the importers pay the duty on the actual value of the goods.
However, Chief Opposition Whip Anura Kumara Dissanayake accused the government of charging the duty proposed in the budget but without penalizing the importers.
The minister denied this allegation as baseless.
Responding to a question asked by Opposition MP BandulaGunawardane on the steps the government intends taking on the demand to reduce import duty on electric vehicles imported on letters of credit, the minister said there were only 35 such vehicles and that 25 of them had already been cleared.
He assured that due consideration would be given to the remaining 12 vehicles. (YP)

Indian girl contacted ISIS agent in Sri Lanka: ToI report
	
A teenage girl from India has been put under surveillance after police investigations had revealed that she had links with the ISIS after establishing contact with one of its agent in Sri Lanka and other ISIS sympathizers on social media networks, the Times of India reported today. 
The 16-year-old Pune college girl, who was allegedly in touch with an Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) executive Mohammed Sirajuddin, has been put under surveillance for her suspected links with the ISIS, assistant commissioner of police, Bhanupratap Barge of the anti-terrorism squad said.
Sirajuddin, who was arrested, had formed closed groups of IS sympathizers, including boys and girls from Maharashtra, on Facebook and WhatsApp. He was allegedly spreading IS activities online and trying to recruit Indian youths for the terrorist group. He was arrested in Jaipur last week.
The girl was deeply influenced by IS activities and radicalized online. She was in regular touch with many sympathizers of the dreaded terrorist group, Barge said.
Officials said the girl was in touch with Sirajuddin and was about to visit Iran or Syria because IS members were ready to bear her medical education and other expenses.
She was regularly interacting with IS sympathizers on WhatsApp and Twitter and exchanging mails with people in countries such as the Philippines, Sri Lanka, Dubai, Saudi Arabia, Kenya and some in Europe.
Investigations showed that the girl was attracted to the IS ideology while watching a television channel four months ago. She began searching for more information on IS on internet portals and established contact with an IS agent in Sri Lanka.
ATS officials said the girl began believing that the world should follow an Islamic ideology and Muslims in India should "do anything for the sake of Islam". Her parents noticed a sudden change in her behaviour. She gave up wearing T-shirts, jeans and dresses to college and began to sport a burqa.
"We have not registered a complaint against the girl because she is a minor and she did not radicalize others," Barge told TOI. "As part of our national programme, we have undertaken an exercise for the past eight days to de-radicalize her with support from her parents."
Barge said they had prevented the girl from joining IS. "The girl has shown remarkable signs of improvement because she has realized that she has done something wrong," he said.

Relations with Britain on sound footing-Ranil
	
The Government is maintaining sound diplomatic relations with Britain even in the absence of a high commissioner in charge of the Sri Lankan mission in that country, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe told Parliament today.
He said the officer who is overseeing the mission is in a position to speak directly to British Prime Minister David Cameron over the phone.
However, he assured that a suitable person would be appointed as the Sri Lankan High Commissioner soon.
Responding to questions asked by Chief Opposition Whip Anura Kumara Dissanayake and MPs Bimal Ratnayake and Udaya Gammanpila, the Prime Minister said the government would not consider whether a person was a career diplomat when a person was appointed to a foreign mission. "Being a career diplomat is not the criteria but the ability to deliver goods is," he said.
He also informed Parliament that the New Zealand Prime Minister would be visiting Sri Lanka next year and that the visit was being directly coordinated by the Foreign Ministry in Colombo without the help of diplomats.
The Prime Minister said this in response to an allegation made by Mr. Dissanayake that UNP working committee members had been given diplomatic appointments. He answered in similar vein to a question asked by Mr Gammanpila whether a UNPer was being be appointed as the Sri Lankan High Commissioner to Britain.
Mr Ratnayake said the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) was opposed to the government policy on foreign postings because the internationally accepted norm was that 70 per cent of diplomatic postings be given to career diplomats and the rest to outsiders. (Yohan Perera)
