Gota approved weapons to armories: Police
	
	In an intial statement to the CID, former Defense Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa said it was he who had approved the issuance of automatic weapons to Rakna Arakshaka Lanka Limited and to the Avant Garde floating armoury in the Galle Port, Police said today.
	His statement was recorded by the CID last week in connection with the activities of the two armouries which were recently checked by the police.
	A three-member CID team which visited Mr. Rajapaksa?s residence to record his statement was told that he neede ample time to study the relevant documents prior to making a proper statement.
	He was reported to have told the detectives that he would give a statement next week at a time he found convenient to do so.
	When asked whether the detectives had accorded any special privilege to Mr. Rajapaksa visiting his residence instead of summoning him to the CID office to record the statement, Police Spokesman Ajith Rohana said there was nothing wrong in the CID visiting somebody to record a statement.
	He said the CID wanted to learn about an approval given by the former Defense Secretary and as such there was no necessity to summon him to the CID office.
	SSP Rohana said the detectives would next obtain information on the weapons procurement procedure adopted by these armouries. (Kevin Kariyawasam)

Centre urged to expedite Sethusamudram project
	
	A delegation from Tamil Nadu Chamber of Commerce and Industry met Union Minister of State for Road Transport, Highways and Shipping Pon. Radhakrishnan in New Delhi recently and made a plea for expediting the Sethusamudram Ship Canal Project through an alternative route.
	The chamber members said the project which involved widening and deepening of the water canal linking Palk Strait with Gulf of Mannar would facilitate movement of mother vessels and avoid circumnavigation of ships around Sri Lanka, thereby resulting in abundant savings in fuel costs and standing charges associated with extra period of voyages.
	N. Jegatheesan, chamber president, and S. Rethinavelu, senior president, met the Union Minister and submitted a memorandum in this regard.
	?The Sethusamudram project would help cut voyage by 424 nautical miles and reduce sailing period by 30 hours. It would transform Tuticorin into a leading container port fetching substantial foreign exchange. This would also lead to development of minor ports such as Ennore, Colachel, Cuddalore, Nagapattinam and Machilipatnam,? the memorandum said.
	A representation was also made to the Centre to ensure early completion of outer harbour project in V.O. Chidambaranar Port in Tuticorin.
	Another demand put forth by the chamber was to lay four-lane national highway between Madurai and Coimbatore. ?Passenger and goods movement between Coimbatore and Madurai and other southern districts is increasing day by day. Now there is four-lane highway only between Madurai and Dindigul,? it was pointed out. (The Hindu)

Delay of UN report must not herald impunity: AI
	
The UN Human Rights Council?s decision to delay the release of the report into alleged human rights violations during the conflict in Sri Lanka must not allow the perpetrators of those crimes to escape punishment, Amnesty International said.
?Sri Lankan victims of human rights violations deserve truth and justice. Survivors of torture, including sexual abuse, people whose family members were killed or forcibly disappeared have waited a long time for this report,? Amnesty International Asia-Pacific Director Richard Bennett said yesterday.
He said a delay is only justifiable if more time will lead to a stronger document and to a concrete commitment by the new Sri Lankan authorities to actively pursue accountability.
?This includes by co-operating with the UN to investigate conflict-era abuses and bring perpetrators to justice,? he said and added that the Human Rights Council must also be vigilant and ensure that all those coming forward to give testimony are protected from any potential threats from those who do not want justice to prevail.
UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra?ad Al Hussein has said ?I give my personal, absolute and unshakeable commitment that the report will be published by September? and that he had received a clear commitment from the new Sri Lankan authorities to cooperate on various issues related to the UN investigation.

Don?t interfere in my work: Rajiva
	
	Higher Education State Minister Rajiva Wijesinghe said today that he should be allowed to work without interference and if the UGC Chairman had to be removed it should have been done after a proper inquiry into the charges levelled against her and not for politically motivated reasons.
	He said the policy of the current Government was to take action against an individual after a formal investigation under the common law of the country and not to remove a person from his or her post in an arbitrary manner like the previous government had done.
	At a ceremony at the Open University Regional Centre in Polgolla, Kandy last morning the state minister pointed out that he should be allowed to function without interference and that he should have been informed of any decision being taken with regard to the University Grants Commission.
	?I have told Minister Kabir Hashim to resolve the concerns faced by the UGC, but to no avail. I have informed the President as well.? The allegations against the UGC chairman should have been properly investigated and not done in any politically motivated manner. I have instructed the relevant authorities to investigate the disbursement of funds especially regarding excessive spending at the South-Eastern University and also complained to the Bribery Commission about it.?
	However, problems will crop up if the Higher Education Ministry takes decisions without my knowledge. Now the UGC is in a crisis and the members are not attending its meetings. If one is responsible for a fraud it should be established through a legal process,? the state minister said. (J.A.L. Jayasinghe)
