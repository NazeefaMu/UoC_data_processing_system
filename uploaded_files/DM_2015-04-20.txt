Commenting on the charge of providing MP Tissa Attanayake a ministerial post as a bribe, former President Mahinda Rajapaksa on Sunday said that there was no point of holding presidency if he cannot appoint a Minister.
Mr. Rajapaksa expressed these views addressing the crowd at the Raja Maha Viharaya in Hambegamuwa.
The National security has been challenged today. I received a New Year gift recently asking me to report to the Bribery Commission regarding a bribe. Accordingly, the bribe and my offence are providing a ministerial portfolio to Mr. Tissa Attanayake. If I am the President, and if I cannot appoint a Minister, I dont need such a post, Mr. Rajapaksa said.
While charging the development projects had been halted today, he said the fate of the funds allocated to development projects was uncertain. However, I believe the people wont forget the development projects we have carried out, he said.
He said some of the Ministers in his government chose to sit on the floor though they were given chairs said some of them were caught by the Police for various offences.
The former President said there was no freedom to organize a Bodhi Pooja without being charged as plotting to come into power.
He also said that Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) was not a mere office or a symbol and said the real SLFP is where there is the five forces gathered (Pancha Maha Balaya) at. I hope the hatred in the peoples hearts will be vanished with the power of these Bodhi Poojas, he said.

MR unlikely to report to the BC
	
	Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa is unlikely to report to the Bribery Commission (BC) though it had summoned him to do so on April 24, his spokesman Rohan Weliwita said today.
	However, he said Mr. Rajapaksa was awaiting a proper response from the Bribery Commission because he is unaware as to why he had been summoned and the name or names of those who filed the complaint against him.
	The Commission should inform him of all the details with regard to the allegations because the former president is only aware that he has been asked to report to the Commission to record a statement, Mr. Weliwita said.
	He said Mr. Rajapaksas lawyers would check what the allegations were and the name or names of who had complained to the commission.
	Mr. Weliwita said the former president had decided not to report to the Bribery Commission if it failed to provide the details of the complaint before April 24.
	Earlier, news reports stated that the BC would record a statement from the former president over a fraudulent document produced by former Health Minister Tissa Attanayake during the presidential election and about the portfolio granted to him no sooner he joined the then government after quitting the UNP.

PMs committee report on Arjuna biased - JHU
	
	The Jathika Hela Urumaya (JHU) yesterday rejected the report by Prime Minister-appointed committee on Central Bank Governors alleged involvement in the Bond sale issue and said the report was biased, and therefore it cannot be accepted.
	We cant accept the biased committee report and its findings that CB Governor Arjuna Mahendran is not involved in the Bond sale. The appointment of Mr. Mahendran itself was controversial raising many arguments among the Cabinet Ministers. Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka clearly spoke against the appointment, JHU National Organizer Nishantha Sri Warnasinghe said.
	He requested the President to appoint a Board with members who posses profound knowledge in the financial sector to re-conduct an impartial investigation into the issue, unlike the Committee appointed by Prime Minister Ranil Wickemesinghe with three pro-United National Party (UNP) Lawyers. 
	Mr. Warnasinghe charged that the Committee report had made Mr. Mahendran clear from the charges, and had instead accused the company involved with his son-in-law as responsible for the issue preventing Mr. Mahendran from taking the blame.
	The Committee appointed by Prime Minister Wickremesinghe is a clear attempt to cover up the offenders. This incident is a blow to good governance (Yahapalanaya) and tarnishes the image of President Maithripala Sirienas administration, he said.
	He reiterated that they completely reject the findings and the recommendations of the report and requested the President to step in to the matter again.(Lahiru Pothmulla)

UPFA MP T.B. Ekanayake who is one of the MPs carrying out the protest said it would not be called off until President Maithripala Sirisena assured them in writing of former president Mahinda Rajapaksas safety and security.
The protesting MPs handed over a petition signed by them to Public Order Minister John Amaratunga urging a written assurance from the President.
We are awaiting the ministers response, Mr. Ekanayake said. 
A group of United Peoples Freedom Alliance (UPFA) MPs earlier staged a protest inside the Parliament chamber against the Bribery Commissions move to summon former President Mahinda Rajapaksa to record statements over an allegation against him.
The allegation levelled against the former President was that he had bribed a ministerial post to former UNP General Secretary Tissa Attanayake for his cross over. 
MPs Nimal Siripala de Silva, Anura Priyadarshana Yapa, Vasudeva Nanayakkara, Dinesh Gunawardane and Wimal Weerawansa were among those who protested against the Commissions move. 
The Prime Minister however assured that adequate security would be provided to Mr. Rajapaksa and he had been summoned only to a record a statement. (YP & LSP)
