Almost 17 million babies breathing toxic air worldwide: UNICEF
	
?
DPA, 06th DECEMBER, 2017- Almost 17 million babies across the world are breathing toxic air, which could be damaging the development of their brains, according to a report released by UNICEF on Wednesday.
There are 136 million children under the age of 1 globally, which means one in eight are being exposed to toxic air, the UN children?s?
fund said.
Satellite imagery analysed by UNICEF indicates that 12.2 million of these children live in South Asia. The East Asia and Pacific region is home to some 4.3 million babies living in areas with pollution levels at least six times higher than international limits.
?Not only do pollutants harm babies? developing lungs - they can permanently damage their developing brains - and, thus, their futures,? said UNICEF executive director?
Anthony Lake.
Lake called on countries exceeding international limits to step up efforts to reduce?
air pollution.

An elite judge and a great personality Deshamanya Justice P. Ramanathan
	
It has been eleven years since the passing away of Justice P. Ramanathan who was well known to me. I recall meeting him for the first time in Kandy at the BASL second Convocation as fellow delegates. Meeting this handsome personality who had a charming smile became friends thereafter forever. Even though he was not involved in politics he had a clear view of the political situation in the country and he used to always discuss matters of political interest from which I benefitted. His political forecast was always accurate.? ?
Justice Ramanathan was educated at St Joseph?s College, Colombo 10 and was a Barrister-at-Law and a Bencher of the Gray?s Inn. He was such a simple person and ready to help so much so that when I requested for a letter of introduction for a young graduate to join Lincoln?s Inn, he never hesitated and readily complied with my request as the father of the young lady was also known to him.??
He served at the Attorney General?s Department and in 1978, mounted the Bench and became a Judge of the High Court and ascended to the Court of Appeal and thereafter to the Supreme Court. As a Judge he performed his duties without any favour and thus we never heard any criticism of his judicial work.??
He was a member of the Permanent Court of Arbitration at The Hague. After his retirement from the Supreme Court he was appointed Governor of the Western Province and thereafter Chancellor of the Uva Wellassa University. In recognition of his dedicated services to the nation, he was honoured with the title ?Deshamanya? the highest National Award of Sri Lanka.??
A past President of the Medico-Legal Association and British Scholars Association, and he also served as the President of the Rotary Club of Colombo Central in 1985/1986 during which period he rendered yeoman service to the community through Rotary, for which Rotary International gave him due recognition.??
He was a descendant of Sir Ponnambalam Ramanathan and the son of S. Pathmanathan who was a respected director of many private and public quoted companies.??
Being a devout Hindu, Justice Ramanathan was also appointed a Trustee of the Sri Ponnambala Vaneswara Temple in Colombo.??
After his marriage, I was delighted to meet his wife Mano, an Attorney-at-Law herself, who arose to be the Senior Deputy Legal Draftsman in the Ministry of Justice, Sri Lanka, and she is the daughter of S. Saravanamuttu, an illustrious advocate of the Supreme Court of Sri Lanka.
When I was persuaded by Mano to be the President of the Board of Management of Holy Family Convent, Bambalapitiya of which she was a distinguished past pupil, Justice Ramanathan being a simple person came all the way to the Lionel Wendt Theatre, where I was at that point of time to have my signature on the nomination form, as the filled-in form was urgently required, ensuring that I will not say no, and of course had his way.??
Having cherished and enjoyed his varied interests to the maximum, he lived a life that was full, regrets were too few to mention, but nevertheless faced it all, stood tall and of course had his way.?

Court orders arrest of Nethicumara if attempts to leave country
	
The Fort Magistrate's Court today ordered the Controller of Immigration and Emigration to prevent Shanil Nethicumara - who had allegedly threatened Anika Wijesuriya, a witness in the Treasury bond investigations - from leaving the country .
The Fort Magistrate made this direction considering a motion filed by the CID seeking an order to prevent the suspect Shanil Nethicumara from leaving the country in an illegal manner.
They told the Magistrate that they had asked Shanil to appear before the CID to record his statement for allegedly threatening witness Anika of the Treasury bond investigation.
However,?the suspect is reportedly absconding the CID and attempting to go overseas. They said the Court had already restrained the suspect from leaving the country.
Hence the Magistrate made the order on the Controller of Immigration and Emigration. The Supreme Court earlier dismissed the Fundamental Rights Petition filed by Shanil Nethicumara seeking an order preventing an imminent arrest for threatening Anika Wijesuriya, who had rented out a penthouse at Monarch Residencies to former Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake and his family.

Court orders arrest of Sub Inspector
	
Kayts Divisional Judge M. Riyaz on Tuesday ordered to take into custody the Sub Inspector who released Swiss Kumar, the main suspect in the gang rape and murder of Vidya, the student from Jaffna.
The Judge made this order when the case against Senior DIG Lalith Jayasinghe, who had been under custody and enlarged on bail over the incident was taken up. The evidence surfaced at this hearing detailed that while six suspects including Swiss Kumar were been taken to Kayts Police Station, a sub inspector identified as Gajan had arrived and taken away Swiss Kumar and another to the Jaffna Police Station and released the two suspects and remanded the remaining four.
As this was stated in the Jaffna High Court, as an action taken on the orders of the DIG, the concerned DIG was taken into custody and later released on bail. With the DIG submitting to the courts that he had not issued any orders or instructions to release Swiss Kumar, and he has no connection whatsoever in this regard, the Judge ordered the immediate arrest of the SI and production in courts.
The suspect SI had gone missing ever since the case on the murder of Vidya was being heard. However, on been confirmed that the SI was connected to this incident, IGP Pujith Jayasundera who visited Jaffna in July took steps to interdict him from service.
When this case was taken up for hearing on Tuesday, the Kayts Magistrate postponed the hearings to February 28, 2018. (Romesh Madushanka)

## Title: Cyril Wickramage: The man from Kohilagedara

Cyril Wickramage: The man from Kohilagedara
	
In Ananda Abeynayake?s Kande Gedara (scripted by Somaweera Senanayake) there is a servant to the two protagonists who is casually referred to as ?Kalagune? (for what reason, we are never told). The protagonists, an ageing couple (the father, played by Rohana Baddage, is placid and friendly, tolerant of everyone, including his wife, played by Ramya Wanigasekara, who?s more hostile and grasping), have three indulgent children, one of whom has a conniving father-in-law who, acting above his station in life, garbles up his Sinhala and English drunkenly and calls this servant Karl.
This father-in-law, played by Cyril Wickramage, is a distillation of every tragicomic aspect to the story. A conman who?s almost caught more than once, he gives the impression of being a well-meaning, unapologetic, expert trickster, and he is: more frail than evil, more misguided than misunderstood. Probably no other actor could have depicted him so well back then.??
It happened in Sath Samudura, one of his first films, and it happened again in Bambaru Avith 10 years later. In both he realises the futility of loving a woman who can never love him back
Cyril Wickramage is what one can call an instinctive actor. In performance after performance he makes you think he?s giving less than what he has. But he never does. Just when you think he?ll stop displaying those hysterics and emotional outbursts he?s very much capable of, he instead does something intensely cathartic. It happened in Sath Samudura, one of his first films, and it happened again in Bambaru Avith 10 years later.
In both he realises the futility of loving a woman who can never love him back, and in both rants and raves against his fate and then triumphs over life, and the need to seek commiseration for his sorrows, by sailing and diving, literally, to his death. That?s his niche: his outbursts are enough to convince us that he?s distraught or unhappy or (as Kande Gedara showed) crafty and conniving, but never to the extent where we believe him to be a stereotypical talker or faker. He is what his instincts have us believe of him.??
And to a considerable extent, those instincts came to him from his childhood, one that was spent in the village and away from the metropolis. Born in Kohilagedara in the Kurunegala District on January 26, 1932, he grew up on a diet of Sokari, Nurti, and Nadagam, patronising them as drama troupe after troupe travelled from Negombo to his home town. ?We watched and revelled in them. During Avurudu we?d look forward to Nurti plays.
No, we never dreamt of becoming actors, onstage or on screen, but my friends and I made these outings an integral part of our common experience. We watched them for the fun of watching them, to be honest.? That was the kind of encounters which Joe Abeywickrama, in Ratnapura, would indulge in. Like Abeywickrama, Cyril didn?t get to watch a great many movies: ?There was the Imperial Theatre in Kurunegala town. We didn?t see English films, only the Sinhala and Tamil ones.? He was about 15 when the Minerva Players made and released Kadawunu Poronduwa. (Perhaps it was the symbiotic relationship between these and the Nurtis he looked forward to that appealed to him.)??
When television came to Sri Lanka, and Wickramage was selected to play various secondary characters in our first TV serials, Pathiraja was there with him
But it wasn?t acting that got to him as a career: it was teaching. Having flirted with the idea of joining the Army (which children his age usually fantasised about at his age), he qualified from the Peradeniya Training College after a two-year course. Thereafter he was employed at various institutions, including the Ratmalana Deaf School and Wesley College, Colombo. All in all he would have taught at seven such schools, and all of them got him deep into not just teaching, but also another field that was linked to his childhood encounters onstage: music.
?I mastered the violin and later dancing during those years. And of all the schools I taught at, it was Wesley that got me thinking seriously about acting.? The latter school got him into contact with Ananda Samarakoon, who had come to watch a play, had seen Wickramage, and had beckoned him to the theatre.??
While he was interested in the theatre at the time, however, it was the cinema which initiated him properly into the performing arts, when in 1965 he was cast opposite Vijitha Mallika in Kingsley Rajapakse?s Handapane. A minor role, it won him praise from those who knew him, including his colleagues, which paid dividends a year later when Siri Gunasinghe cast him opposite Swarna Mallawarachchi, Edmund Wijesinghe, and Somasiri Dehipitiya in Sath Samudura.
What I like most about Gunasinghe?s film, apart from its fidelity to a milieu that only documentary makers had explored before in our cinema, was its preference for silence and introspection over wordy conversations. In large part that was exemplified in the sequences with Wickramage?s character Gunadasa, who hankers after a woman who can never have him, fights with a brother and an insensitive sister-in-law (Mallawarachchi in her first outing), and is loved only by the mother (Denawaka Hamine). Wickramage had grown up on the verbal barrages of the Nurti theatre. The film and roles he clinched were worlds away from those barrages.??
Cyril Wickramage is what one can call an instinctive actor. In performance after performance he makes you think he?s giving less than what he has. But he never does
To this end two people figured in his subsequent career: Dr Linus Dissanayake, the producer of Sath Samudura, and Dharmasena Pathiraja, who cast him in nearly every film of his from Ahas Gawwa. Aboard Sath Samudura as an Assistant Director was Vasantha Obeyesekere, who together with Dissanayake made his first film, Ves Gaththo, in 1970. I have unfortunately not seen Ves Gaththo, but I do know that the theme it tackled ? the rift between education and employability ? was tackled and realised more vividly in his second film, Valmath Wuwo.
Both these featured Wickramage and the latter of them had him perform a Nadagam song, probably a tribute to the plays he had watched as a child. Meanwhile, a second collaboration with Dissanayake resulted in Wickramage?s first directorial venture: Sihina Lowak, a love story that more than anything else is remembered for the Amaradeva-Mahagama Sekara classic, ?Ma Mala Pasu.? An even bigger set of collaborations would follow with Dharmasena Pathiraja.??
Pathiraja, in Bambaru Avith, cast Wickramage as an almost inverted version of Gunadasa from Sath Samudura: now more assertive, more brutal. Even though the plot doesn?t let us in on why he resents the anti-hero, Victor (Vijaya Kumaratunga), it is manifestly clear that he seethes with anger and jealousy when Helen (Malini Fonseka) falls in love with him. It may well be that Wickramage?s character (also called Cyril) can?t reciprocate Helen?s love for him the way that Victor can; or it may well be that there?s a political subtext, with Cyril?s milieu militating against Victor?s on the personal plane (sexual politics, after all, is politics). Either way, his love for the woman who rejects him blinds and in the end consumes him (we are not made to see whether he commits suicide, or whether he?s killed off by one of Victor?s goons), and also provokes the final tragic encounter in the film: between Victor and his enemy, the feudalistic Anton aiya (Joe Abeywickrama), killed off (again) by one of the former?s goons (Daya Tennakoon).??
With Pathiraja, as one can see from the roles he was chosen for, he was cast in a different mould. Not surprisingly, Wickramage remembers the man with sincere delight. ?No other director tried to weed out the false and romantic from his films as he did, I can tell you that. He came from the village, very much like I did, but he was adept at depicting the urban youth. He was in fact fascinated by how the city was being invaded and assailed by the village and how the city in turn tried to assimilate the village to its values. To this end he was faithful in his depictions of both locales. Other directors went for their share of criticism when it came to the settings and backdrops of their movies. Not Pathiraja.???
So when television came to Sri Lanka, and Wickramage was selected to play various secondary characters in our first TV serials, Pathiraja was there with him. I have not seen Wickramage in some of these serials, including La Hiru Dahasak (reputedly Sri Lanka?s second after Dimuthu Muthu), Sasara Sayuren (which won for him a Best Actor Award from Wijeya Newspapers), and even Manik Nadiya Gala Basi (where he?s a gem merchant consumed by idealism first and later greed and envy), but I have seen him in Kande Gedara,Elle Langa Walawwa, and Kadulla, the latter two of which trace the subtle interrelationships between the colonial bourgeoisie and the village peasantry and both of which were directed by Pathiraja.
I have not seen Wickramage in some of these serials, including La Hiru Dahasak (reputedly Sri Lanka?s second after Dimuthu Muthu), Sasara Sayuren, which won for him a Best Actor Award from Wijeya Newspapers
In Ella Langa Walawwa especially, which gives the impression of being made indifferently, in a hurry, he?s the centre that holds the narrative together as the man servant Appu Hamy, despite its various meanderings and confusions that culminate in what I consider to be a less than satisfactory ending.??
As he mellowed, Cyril Wickramage let go of his youthful avatar and became the sagacious, empathetic man of few words. While he decries contemporary television shows, for instance, he is nevertheless a character actor in them, usually playing out the role of the friendly, concerned elder. He never speaks more than he has to, and never being wont to emotional outbursts he?s caught our attention as a side player in ways that youth can?t really exude and match.
This makes his admiration for Marlon Brando (?Brando was the only real actor in a Shakespearean cast in the 1953 adaptation of Julius Caesar,? he told me frankly) all the more mystifying. He?s certainly no Brando, and he is, as I pointed out to a friend of mine around a year ago, as far away from the cinema of brawn as Gregory Peck was from John Wayne, if we are to take a metaphor and point of comparison from the American cinema of the 1950s: the decade in which he bloomed.??

His crafty plan boomeranged on him
	
It was about 6 o?clock in the evening. A luxury van used to transport foreigners on its way to Colombo stopped in front of a fruit stall in Galle. The driver of the vehicle got down from the vehicle clutching his chest. He claimed he was experiencing a chest pain.
He was given first-aid by by-standers. The driver told his helpers that his purse, the key to the vehicle and his mobile phone were inside the van. After receiving first-aid, he was taken to a hospital close by. On his insistence, a call was taken on his mobile phone to inform his wife of his plight. After some time, the owner of the vehicle arrived at the place where the van was parked. He is a resident of Mahamodera. He opened the door of the van and checked the purse that was still inside. To his knowledge there should have been at least rupees eight hundred and four thousand in the purse. But to his dismay he did not find a cent.
This driver was driving some foreigners to several locations and had been paid Rs. 804, 000 for a three-week-long trip a foreign family who had been staying in Unawatuna had given him.
The day after he was discharged from the hospital the police took him into custody. It was discovered that he had actually not suffered a heart attack and had tried a fast one on the owner of the van. The suspect is a resident of Bandarawela aged 38. The foreign family had also came to the police station and made a statement to the police saying that they paid him the money that had gone 'missing'. He reluctantly accepted that he received the money but claimed that someone must have stolen the money from the vehicle while he was receiving treatment.They say the best laid plans sometimes go awry. This is a good example of it.
OIC Chief Inspector Sujeewa Silva and SI Palitha Ranasinghe of the Special Crimes Unit of the Galle Police are conducting further investigations. The suspect was to be charged with criminal breach of trust. (D.G. Sugathapala)

The HRCSL had directed the Director Education of the North Central Province to hold an inquiry against those involved in making this hasty decision to send the girl in question home and to send the report on its findings to the commission.
The HRCSL initiated the investigation after reading reports in the media of a school girl being asked to leave the school by the school authorities who thought that she was pregnant when she actually was vomiting as she had not eaten breakfast that morning. The recent decision carried the signatures of the Chairperson of the Commission Dr. Deepika Udugama and its Commissioner, Presidents Council Saliya Peiris.
The Commission had observed that the disciplinary committee of the school in question had taken an arbitrary decision within a day to remove the girl from school without holding a disciplinary inquiry according to the circular issued by the Ministry of Education. (Tharindu Jayawardena)

Reducing tax on Beer: Brewing company to enjoy financial benefits- GMOA
	
The government?s attempt to reduce the tax on liquor through the Budget 2018 would only result in having financial benefits to the main brewing company in the country, which incurred huge losses in preceding years, the Government Medical Officers? Association (GMOA) charged yesterday.
GMOA Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge told a news conference that according to the annual reports of this brewing company for 2016/17, it had incurred a loss Rs. 1.4 billion whereas it had obtained a profit of Rs. 2 billion in 2015/16.
Dr. Aluthge said that according to this brewing company, the reason behind this huge loss in 2016/17 was the floods occurred in last year.
?However, it is a well-known fact that the government had granted a huge tax relief on this brewing company in return for its loss in 2016/17. Reducing of tax on liquor will only pave the way to this brewing company to obtain more and more financial benefits,? he added.
Meanwhile, he said that the prices of beer would be reduced by 33 per cent following the tax relief on beer through the Budget 2018. He also said that it could be considered as an open invitation for all to consume beer.
He said that according to the economists it had been revealed that the consumption of beer would be increased by 22 per cent in next year due to the tax relief.
He said the GMOA would hope that the related authorities would take adequate measures to abolish these budget proposals which were contrary to the national policy of the country and which would risk the entire healthcare services as well. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)

Rupee ends firmer on dollar remittances
	
REUTERS: The Sri Lankan rupee closed stronger yesterday on dollar sales by exporters and year-end remittances, dealers said.
The spot rupee ended at 153.25/35 per dollar, compared with Tuesday?s close of 153.30/40.
The rupee has lost 2.4 percent so far this year, but currency dealers say the dollar demand has slightly waned, lending support to the rupee.
The market has been waiting for more clarity over a foreign exchange management act introduced by the government last month.
Central Bank Governor Indrajit Coomaraswamy said the new act would decriminalise offences related to foreign exchange trading and impose fines instead.
Foreign investors bought equities net worth Rs.18.6 billion this year, as of Tuesday?s close. They bought government securities net worth Rs.49.2 billion as of November 29, official data showed.

SL complains to ICC on air pollution during Delhi Test
	
Sri Lanka Cricket has officially filed a complaint with the International Cricket Council regarding the disturbing levels of pollution in Delhi after the conclusion of the third Test between India and Sri Lanka.
Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara lodged the complaint on Tuesday itself saying "we can't play like this as four players had vomited" due to the pollution.
The ICC responded by saying that they would take necessary action; however, no action has been taken so far.
Despite India and Sri Lanka playing out a stalemate at the Feroz Shah Kotla in New Delhi, the Test had its fair share of controversies which kept fans gripped to the action on the field.
On the second day of play, the Sri Lankan players were seen donning masks on the field to cope with the pollution in the air. The play was even stopped which forced the Sri Lankan and Indian coach to come out onto the field and have a chat with the officials.
A few Sri Lankan players had to leave the field as well as they felt uneasy.
Sri Lankan captain Dinesh Chandimal went on to say that his side was not used to such conditions, which led to their struggle on the first two days.
The Lankans managed to save the match from a losing position while chasing 410 for victory. They ended their innings with 299 runs on the board for the loss of five wickets. Dhananjeya de Silva top scored for them with a scintillating century to his name.
However, India went on to win the three-match series 1-0.
The ICC is yet to respond to SLC's complaint and take some action.
The pollution in Delhi has affected a lot of people over the past few months and the match should have been shifted from there in the first place.
After the events which transpired in the final Test between India and Sri Lanka, the ICC might step in and drop Delhi as a venue during the winter due to the spike in pollution.(SportsKeeda)

Supreme Court allows full enforcement of Trump travel ban
	
?
THE HINDU, 06th DECEMBER, 2017- The U.S. Supreme Court allowed the Trump administration to fully enforce its revised ban on people from eight nations from travelling to the country. The third iteration of the travel ban ? after the first two were blocked by the judiciary ? has been partially in force already.
The SC order has not explained the reasons for its decision but nudged the lower courts that are hearing the arguments on the merit of the case to move faster. Two appeals courts are expected to hear arguments in separate cases, challenging the ban this week. President Donald Trump?s decision has been challenged on questions such as his legal authority to issue such an order and whether it constitutes a religious test and a Muslim ban, as promised by Mr. Trump during the 2016 presidential campaign. The Trump administration has argued before the courts that the travel ban is for national security.
Six of the eight countries barred by the order are majority-Muslim ? Syria, Libya, Iran, Yemen, Chad and Somalia. North Korea and Venezuela are the other two. The SC order, supported by seven of the nine judges, increases the chances of the administration winning the case on merit as and when it reaches the highest court.

Tales of a revolutionary forest monk
	
Ven. Anandasiri was assassinated during a time when the country was ravaged by a war against terrorism and an uprising by the JVP
?
?
The recent focus on the Yala National Park being overcrowded takes the minds of wildlife enthusiasts to the 20th century, the time when it was a pleasure to go on a safari in anyone of the island?s 26 national parks.? ?
?
This was a time when Buddhist devotees trekked through the jungles of Kutumbigala to Kataragama, on pilgrimage. There are also records of a forest dwelling monk by the name of Ven. Thambugala Anandasiri inspiring the villagers to go on pilgrimage and even joining them on most occasions. Memorable moments of the priest?s jungle travels have been included in a two-book series titled ?25 Years of Life in the Jungle?, which was published by Dayawansa Jayakody & Company.? ?
As much as Ven. Anandasiri was a great exponent of the Dhamma, he was also well-aware of the jungle habitat and ways of the wild animals. He came to reside in the Kutumbigala jungles in 1954 and took great effort to clean and make conducive for living several ancient caves.? ?
During these times the jungles in the east of Sri Lanka weren?t very populated, hence wild animals were virtually undisturbed. The monk, during these travels, came across elephants, crocodiles, Pangolins, bear and different kinds of leopards, but there was never an occasion during these times of this monk?s life (1930-1989) that he had been harmed by any wild animal. Ven. Anandasiri in the book states that he practised the Dhamma and the Dhamma in return protected him.? ?
?
Coexistence between humans and animals
The book gives us an insight into the subtle unwritten laws of the jungle which help immensely in the coexistence between humans and animals in the wilderness. According to him there had been occasions when he had spoken kind words to animals and even avoided confronting them to ensure?
peace exists. He also talks about animals not showing the tendency to be aggressive when they see the ochre coloured robe of a monk.? ?
He based himself at Kutumbigala and there soon was a small committee (Kapakaru mandalaya) established to look into the needs of the handful of forest dwelling monks who resided there. At the beginning he was alone and had the habit of reciting the ?Sathipattana Suthra? and offering merit to God Skanda with the motive of obtaining protection, before going to sleep in the night. A few days later in a dream a man with a giant body emerged and taught him the stanza ?Ithipiso bhagawa? which is used by Buddhists to dispel fears during challenging times. There are ample instances in the book when the reciting of the first few words of this stanza had brought results.? ?
?
?25 Years of Life in the Jungle?, which was published by Dayawansa Jayakody & Company
?
?
The Lenama Leopard?
Unlike today, where even the ferocious leopards in the wild are harassed by jeep drivers, this was a time when the ?cats? roamed freely. The priest says in the book that the biggest leopards had been seen in the wilds of Lenama, an area which fell within the boundaries of Panama. The priest says that the Lenama leopard never flees when he sees a human and compared to other ?cats? isn?t ferocious. It is these leopards who are said to have wiped out an entire generation of veddas who lived in Lenama.? ?
Ven. Anandasiri Thera cultivated close relationships with the villagers of Panama. This village, during the time of the priest, was populated by Sinhalese people. But most of the men folks placed their beliefs in voodoo and witchcraft. The priest was able to convert most of them to Buddhism. A key feature in the society that helped the priest to teach them Dhamma is their culture of respecting elders, a habit which is present even today!? ?
?
Kutumbigala National Park
Ven. Anandasiri was known as a revolutionary. He encountered some opposition when he sought membership in the order of forest dwelling monks. But the monk who spearheaded this movement, Ven. Kadavadduwe Jinawamsa, saw Ven. Anandasiri?s potential and allowed him to join the clan of monks who operated under the ?Samathawa? umbrella. Much later in years Ven. Anandasiri reached a milestone in monkhood when he was successful in getting the Kutumbigala National Park gazetted on September 8th 1973. This move immensely helped in the nurturing of the Kutumbigala Forest Hermitage, where the monk resided.
Obtaining National Park status also helped Kutumbigala protect its valuable trees and herbs. The ability in villagers to using herbs for treatment underscores the presence of traditional healing methods in Sri Lanka, which was not mixed with the Indian Ayurveda system, which entered the country much later. Kutumbigala belongs to Kumana which is one of six villages that make up Panama ?Paththuwa?. According to the priest there are 58 Buddhist worship sites in Panama.? ?
There were occasions when Ven. Anandasiri came across hunters and people involved in illicit activities such as graphite mining. He always preached Dhamma to those who were willing to listen. With those involved in illicit activities and who didn?t wish to be reformed he maintained a ?didn?t see, didn?t hear? approach.? ?
A key characteristic in the priest was that he was naturally friendly. The words he selected to speak often oozed with kindness. There are records where he had subdued ferocious animals merely by speaking kindly to them.? ?
Despite his travels and the many sermons that he made to propagate the Dhamma, Ven. Anandasiri always set aside time to meditate and reflect within. He was in all sense a true forest dwelling monk.? ?
?
Ven. Kadavadduwe Jinawamsa, saw Ven. Anandasiri?s potential and allowed him to join the clan of monks who operated under the ?Samathawa? umbrella
?
?
Assassination?
Once the monk took a group to the lagoon in Salawa Forest. After spending some time at the lagoon the members of the group had started to meditate on the banks of the lagoon. After about two hours the priest had adjourned his meditation, a practice he observed given that he was in the jungle and animals approached people, regardless whether they slept, meditated or travelled. The priests had then seen a crocodile closing in on one of the member of the group who fast asleep. Seeing the priest walking briskly up to the person who was asleep, the crocodile panicked and slid back into the waters. The priest had told the group that those who live by the religion are protected by it and also obtain the power ?to see?.? ?
Ven. Anandasiri had no enemies. His close associates state that he was a Buddha aspirant. Author Prof. Michael Carrithers has set aside a chapter for Ven. Anandasiri in his much acclaimed book ?The forest monks of Sri Lanka?.?
?
In the mid 1980s the priest was forced to leave his forest hermitage in Kutumbigala and head to Monaragala due to the ongoing commotion in the east during this period.? ?
Despite being so humble and having a revered status bestowed upon him, a group of unknown gunmen shot him dead on October 3rd 1989. The remains of Ven. Anandasiri were cremated at the Borella Cemetery on October 6th.? ?
?
The ability in villagers to using herbs for treatment underscores the presence of traditional healing methods in Sri Lanka, which was not mixed with the Indian Ayurveda system, which entered the country much later
?
The wordings on the back cover of the book describes the monk?s assassins as a group of people who weren?t accustomed to any religious practice and didn?t have the habit of doing good deeds. Ven. Anandasiri was a good example of how to live life in keeping with Buddhas teachings. His life also underscores the core message of The Enlightened One that ?all good things come with an expiry date?.? ? ?

## Title: Trump recognizes Jerusalem as Israel?s capital, orders U.S. Embassy to move

Trump recognizes Jerusalem as Israel?s capital, orders U.S. Embassy to move
	
President Trump on Wednesday formally recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, reversing nearly seven decades of American foreign policy and setting in motion a plan to move the United States Embassy from Tel Aviv to the fiercely contested Holy City.
?Today we finally acknowledge the obvious: that Jerusalem is Israel?s capital,? Mr. Trump said from the Diplomatic Reception Room of the White House. ?This is nothing more or less than a recognition of reality. It is also the right thing to do. It?s something that has to be done.?
The president cast his decision as a break with decades of failed policy on Jerusalem, which the United States, along with virtually every other nation in the world, has declined to recognize as the capital since Israel?s founding in 1948. That policy, he said, brought us ?no closer to a lasting peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.?
?It would be folly to assume that repeating the exact same formula would now produce a different or better result,? Mr. Trump declared.
Recognizing Jerusalem, he added, was ?a long overdue step to advance the peace process.?
Mr. Trump?s remarks were the most closely scrutinized of his presidency on the Middle East, where he has vowed to broker the ?ultimate deal? between Israelis and Palestinians but has yet to find a breakthrough to end the conflict. He said he remained committed to brokering an agreement ?that is a great deal for the Israelis and a great deal for the Palestinians.?
The president said the decision to recognize Jerusalem should not be construed as the United States taking a position on whether, or how, the city might ultimately be shared. But he offered little solace to the Palestinians, making no mention of their long-held hopes for East Jerusalem to be the capital of a Palestinian state.
Instead, Mr. Trump emphasized the domestic political dimension of the decision. He noted that he had promised to move the embassy during the 2016 presidential campaign, and added, ?While previous presidents have made this a major campaign promise, they failed to deliver. Today, I am delivering.?
Though he did not mention it, Mr. Trump signed the same national security waiver signed by his predecessors, from Barack Obama to George W. Bush to Bill Clinton, which will allow the administration to keep the embassy in Tel Aviv for an additional six months. White House officials said that was unavoidable because it would take several years to move the embassy staff to a new facility in Jerusalem.
?There will of course, be disagreement and dissent regarding this announcement,? the president said. He appealed for ?calm, for moderation, and for the voices of tolerance to prevail over the purveyors of hate.?
Mr. Trump?s recognition of Jerusalem isolates the United States on one of the world?s most sensitive diplomatic issues. It has drawn a storm of criticism from Arab and European leaders, which swelled on Tuesday night after the White House confirmed Mr. Trump?s plans.
Pope Francis and the Chinese foreign ministry joined the chorus of voices warning that the move could unleash a wave of violence across the region. At a meeting in Brussels, Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson was sternly reproached by European allies.
Standing next to Mr. Tillerson, the European Union?s top diplomat, Federica Mogherini, made clear that Europe saw the president?s decision as a threat to peace in the Middle East.
?We believe that any action that would undermine these efforts must absolutely be avoided,? she said. ?A way must be found through negotiations to resolve the status of Jerusalem as a future capital of both states.?
Just hours before Mr. Trump made his announcement, Mr. Tillerson said that peace in the Middle East was still possible.
Mr. Tillerson, during a news conference at NATO headquarters in the heart of Europe, expressed reassurances about the expected consequences of the decision.
?The president?s very committed to the Middle East peace process,? Mr. Tillerson said.
Mr. Tillerson has been largely shut out of the usual back-and-forth between Israelis and Palestinians that many secretaries of state spent much of their tenures conducting. Instead, Mr. Trump entrusted that task to his son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner.
At least one former Obama administration official also weighed in with sharp criticism. John O. Brennan, the former director of the Central Intelligence Agency, said in a statement that Mr. Trump?s action was ?reckless? and would ?damage U.S. interests in the Middle East for years to come and will make the region more volatile.?
Administration officials said they expected the blowback from the Palestinians and others, but they asserted that the move would accelerate, not hinder, the peace process.
Mr. Trump?s promise to move the embassy appealed to evangelical voters and pro-Israel American Jews, including Sheldon Adelson, the Las Vegas casino magnate. By delivering on that promise, Mr. Trump?s aides said, he was enhancing his credibility as a peacemaker.
The announcement, officials said, was recognition of current and historic reality. West Jerusalem is the seat of Israel?s government, and recognizing it as such would remove ambiguity from the American position, they said.
Jerusalem is one of the world?s most fiercely contested swaths of real estate, with each side disputing the other?s claims. Palestinians view East Jerusalem as the capital of a future Palestinian state, and most of the world considers it occupied territory. Jerusalem?s Old City has the third-holiest mosque in Islam and the holiest site in Judaism, making the city?s status a sensitive issue for Muslims and Jews alike. Jerusalem is also sacred ground to Christians.
In addition to declining to take a position on the ultimate shape of Jerusalem, Mr. Trump called for the status quo on a disputed area of the Old City, known as the Temple Mount to Jews and the Noble Sanctuary to Muslims, which has been a flash point for tensions.
Mr. Kushner and Jason D. Greenblatt, the president?s special envoy, have been working for months to prepare for a negotiation between Israelis and Palestinians. Though they have little to show for the effort publicly, they say they have made progress behind the scenes.
Those efforts, Middle East experts said, would be jeopardized by Wednesday?s announcement. But Mr. Kushner and Mr. Greenblatt, the president?s special envoy, supported the president?s move, officials said. (nytimes)

Trump to recognize Jerusalem as Israel capital
	
?
President Donald Trump on Wednesday will recognize Jerusalem as Israel?s capital and set in motion the relocation of the U.S. Embassy to the ancient city, senior U.S. officials said, a decision that upends decades of U.S. policy and risks fueling violence in the?Middle East.??
Facing an outcry of opposition from Arab capitals, Trump, in a landmark speech, will announce he has ordered the State Department to begin developing a plan to move the embassy from Tel Aviv in what is expected to be a process that takes three to four years, the officials said. He will not set a timetable for?the move.??
Trump will sign a national security waiver that authorizes him to delay the embassy relocation for now, since the U.S. diplomats do not yet have a building in Jerusalem to move into, security arrangements or housing for diplomats, the officials said.??
Still, Trump?s endorsement of Israel?s claim to all of Jerusalem as its capital would reverse long-standing U.S. policy that the city?s status must be decided in negotiations with the Palestinians, who want East Jerusalem as the capital of their future state.? The international community does not recognize Israeli sovereignty over the entire city, home to sites holy to the Muslim, Jewish and?
Christian religions. The officials, who briefed reporters ahead of Trump?s speech at 1 p.m. EST (1800 GMT) on Wednesday, insisted that Trump?s decision, intended to fulfil a key campaign promise, was not meant to pre-judge the outcome of eventual talks on the final status of Jerusalem or other major disputes between the?
two sides.?

Yemen rebels holding more than 40 media staff
	
?
Yemeni rebels who seized full control of the capital Sanaa over the past week have detained more than 40 media staff, press watchdogs said on Wednesday, demanding their immediate release.?
?
They include staff of Yemen Today -- a television channel affiliated with former president Ali Abdullah Saleh, whom the Huthi rebels killed on Monday as he fled the capital following the collapse of their uneasy three-year alliance, the watchdogs said.??
The rebels overran the television?s Sanaa offices on Saturday after attacking it with rocket-propelled grenades and wounding three guards, Reporters Without Borders (RSF) said.??
??This hostage-taking is typical of the climate of hostility in Yemen towards journalists, who are often targeted in this conflict,? said RSF?s Alexandra El Khazen.??
A spokesman for the Committee to Protect Journalists called for the immediate release of the journalists, saying the Huthi attack on Yemen Today ?shows a profound contempt for press freedom?.??
Saleh, who ruled Yemen for three decades, had joined forces with the Huthis in 2014 when they took control of large parts of the country, including the capital.??
But that alliance unravelled over the past week as the former leader reached out to the Saudi-led coalition that has waged an air campaign against the Huthis since March 2015.??
A least 234 people were killed in fighting that the International Committee of the Red Cross described as the fiercest since the start of the conflict.??
An official of Saleh?s General People?s Congress (GPC) said some of the detained staff had since been transferred to prison while others were still being held in the television?s offices.??
??The Huthis were exerting pressure on them to change their coverage, to issue certain statements and report the betrayal of former president Saleh and accuse him of working for the Arab coalition.??
??But the journalists refused to do it,? the official said.??
