Army leaves Kudiyiruppu Camp
	
The Army has evacuated the Kudiyiruppu Camp which was in the hands of the army for the past 26 years.
The camp which belonged to the Vanni security headquarters contributed immensely to provide security to the Sinhala and Tamil people during the war.
Vavuniya District Secretary Rohana Pushpakumara said the army has taken steps to hand over the building where the camp had been set up to the Vavuniya district secretary.
This building which belonged to Vavuniya district secretary had been entrusted to the army 26 years ago to set up the camp.
This building used to be a Cultural Hall and no decision has been taken as to how it would be used.
A group of protesters from a Vavuniya Youth Organisation protested in front of the Kudiyiruppu Army Camp last week demanding the Government to immediately release their lands which were occupied for military requirements. (Romesh Madushanka)

Death toll reaches 247 in Italy earthquake
	
At least 247 people were killed after a 6.2-magnitude earthquake struck central Italy Wednesday, according to Italy's Civil Protection Department.
In the small Italian towns hit hard by a magnitude-6.2 earthquake that struck in the middle of the night, rescuers feverishly dug through the rubble of downed homes and apartments looking for survivors.
In one such rescue, shown on CNN affiliate Sky TG24, a firefighter in Amatrice clawed at the rubble, trying to get to a little girl.
He pulled back bricks and other debris as his co-workers and other men leaned in.
Suddenly there was a foot, and leg, then the other leg.
In the video, a man seems to be talking to the girl, as someone repeatedly says the name "Julia."
Several people wriggle in to help the firefighter.
The firefighter clutches a girl, said to be 8 years old, and walks her out of the huge pile of rubble as a volley of cheers erupts.
The girl silently holds on. It is impossible to tell what color clothes she is wearing because she is coated in gray dust.
"Bella ragazza!" one bystander says as the girl is carried to safety. "Beautiful girl!"
Similar scenes played out in Amatrice and the other towns hit hardest by the deadly quake, which killed at least 159 people, according to ANSA, Italy's national news agency. (CNN)

## Title: Five Lankans drowned in London

Five Lankans drowned in London
	
Five men who drowned off Camber Sands in East Sussex, England were a group of Sri Lankan friends visiting from London - but beachgoers today urged police to reveal more about their mysterious deaths.
Sri Lankan friends Nitharsan Ravi, Inthushan Sri brothers Kobi Nathan, Ken Nathan, and Kurushanth Anna, all from south-east London, drowned together yesterday.
Three victims were pulled from the sea off the East Sussex beach yesterday afternoon and emergency services tried and failed to revive them in front of thousands of horrified holidaymakers.
Two more bodies - also believed to be wearing shorts and T-shirts - were found washed up by a walker as the tide went out last night.
They may have been pulled to their deaths by the powerful riptide but Sussex Police is yet to say why they think the men got in trouble, leading to concerns from beachgoers about their own safety.
Last month 19-year-old Brazilian Gustavo Silva Da Cruz died after getting into difficulties while swimming off the famous beach. In July a father and son suffered serious injuries after they were attacked by a swarm of jellyfish.
Sam Maynard, 40, who runs a beach equipment rentals company, said the continuing safety concerns and a lack of lifeguards could 'crucify' businesses.
He said: 'We just want to know what happened. It could crucify us, especially as it's a month to the day since that boy drowned last month. It's a safe beach. No one understands how this could have happened.'
Shocking: Three dead bodies were pulled from the sea off Camber Sands in East Sussex yesterday afternoon and two more bodies were found on the beach as the tide went out last night on the hottest day of the year.
Holidaymaker Gail McLean, 38, from London, was among the 25,000 at Camber Sands yesterday, said: 'No one understood how someone could have got in trouble - the water was calm as you like.? It's so unusual to have five men drown'.
Another witness said: 'We noticed when we came here that there were no lifeguards. We had kids here and we were worried about them.'
'The sea is very shallow for quite a long way. It seems so strange how they got into trouble. There was no waves and no wind'.
Witnesses said the first three dead men - who are believed to originally be from Sri Lanka - did not appear to have any family or friends with them and may have travelled together from London.
Their clothes led to speculation that the victims could be illegal immigrants - but a police source said that the investigation is at an early stage and 'there is currently nothing to suggest the men were migrants'.
Chief Superintendent Di Roskilly said the men were all 'wearing clothes appropriate for being at the beach' when they died and 'came together for the day'.
She said: 'We believe they are all in their late teens and early 20s and come from the Greater London area. We have no further reports of anyone else missing from Camber and there are no on-going searches related to this incident.
This has been an incredibly tragic incident and we are offering their next of kin support at this difficult time and our thoughts are with them.'??
The deaths led to renewed calls for lifeguards to be permanently stationed on the popular tourist beach. An online petition calling for the change has received more than 2,000 signatures.
Local councillor Paul Osborne said today swimmers need to be careful at Camber.
He said: 'We obviously want people to come to the beach, enjoy it and then drive home after. The sea is great, but it doesn't give up if you get into difficulty. It has to be respected.
'Camber is safe; it's not massively deep. But you do find people go in even if they can't swim and then get into difficulty. It's not a pool with steps, which doesn't have a current. The beach is a different entity all together.
'Personally I wouldn't go into the sea, and I can swim. I wouldn't risk it. If you can't swim, don't go in the sea.'
The five deaths bring the toll to 12 in less than a week as people head for the coast at the tail end of the school holidays.
Two-year-old Mckayla Bruynius died at Bristol Children's Hospital on Tuesday night after she was caught by a large wave at Fistral beach in Newquay, Cornwall, on Friday.
Her father, Rudy Bruynius, was also killed after getting into trouble as 13ft waves lashed the coast amid strong winds and rain.
A mother and son died on Saturday after a rescue operation at Aberdeen beach, while a windsurfer in his 60s died in a Colchester hospital after being rescued off the coast of West Mersea, Essex.
On Sunday a woman in her 30s died after getting into difficulties while swimming off Jersey, before a man died despite the efforts of medics after getting stuck in a rip current at Sandbanks beach in Poole, Dorset.
The alarm was raised at around 2.10pm when the first male swimmer was spotted struggling in the water.
As the emergency services, search and rescue helicopters and an air ambulance were scrambled to the scene, another man was seen in trouble ten minutes later.
Both men were pulled from the sea in a life-threatening condition. A third swimmer was then recovered from the same stretch of water at 2.35pm. Families were left in tears as they watched medics trying in vain to save the lives of the men using CPR.
Hannah Chatfield, from Coulsdon in Surrey, was at the beach with her mother, boyfriend and nephews when the drama unfolded.
She told MailOnline: 'We were on the beach when someone was pulled out, and about half an hour later a woman came up shouting saying there were more people in water.
'The lifeguards were busy with the person they had already dragged out so me and about seven other people, including a lifeguard, all ran down to the water.
'The man was quite far out but he wasn't really far out - we swam over to him and dragged him up on to the sand. I think he was in his 30s.
'Then the medics started doing CPR on him and the others and that went on for quite a while but I think they just gave up in the end.'
Kelly Thisleton, 40, from Sidcup, told The Sun: 'We were sitting on the beach when we saw someone pulling a young black guy out of the water. All the beach guards rushed down. It was three black gentlemen in their late 20s in the end.'
Police patrolled the beach using loudhailers ordering sunbathers not to enter the water.
Natalja Taylor, 30, who was on a day-trip with her husband, said: 'We saw three people being pulled out of the water. I think the people who rescued them were regular people, not emergency personnel. We don't know what condition they were in.
'Police drove on to the beach with a loudspeaker, telling people not to go into the water. They taped off a huge chunk of the beach. I'm not sure how it happened. It wasn't particularly windy, it was just a hot, sunny beach day. There were a lot of people on the beach, particularly for a weekday.'(Daily Mail)

JO to present proposal in Parliament demanding LG polls
	
The Joint Opposition would today present a proposal in Parliament demanding immediate local government elections, which has been already delayed by one year and three months, the Joint Opposition said yesterday.
Addressing a media briefing, Joint Opposition member MP Bandula Gunawardane said the Government?s motive behind the postponing of the local government elections, was an attempt to grab hold of the democratic rights of the public.
?Therefore, we will present a proposal, which stresses the House to hold the local government elections in a democratic way,? he added.
Joint Opposition member Prof. G.L. Peiris said the related authorities had no concern of holding the local government elections and they had even not hinted at a time either.
Meanwhile, he said the rulers of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) were in an intentional mission to destroy the party and it was evident from the removal of strong personalities from organiser posts.
?The removal of such personalities is in favour of the United National Party (UNP) and it will help the UNP to be victorious in the upcoming elections,? he added.
He said the Government?s actions were completely against the people?s will and the Prime Minister was in a mission to take the government completely to his hands.
Joint Opposition member MP Mahindananda Aluthgamage said the policies of the UNP were against the ones of the SLFP and it was the reason for them to represent the Joint Opposition.
He also said the remaining SLFP organisers of the Joint Opposition would be removed from their posts even tomorrow.
?No matter what, we will never take a part in a UNP Government,? he added.
He said the Prime Minister had stated in the COPE meeting that 75 percent of the harbour would be privatised and such decisions would also lead the country to a major crisis.(Kalathma Jayawardhane)

JO urges local inquiry into Aussie reports
	
The joint opposition today requested President Maithripala Sirisena to call for a local investigation regarding the news reports in the Australian media involving the name of President Sirisena over a bribery investigation conducted on a company there.
Addressing a media briefing, joint opposition member MP Wimalaweera Dissanayake said it was not good for the country when the president is being accused of such an act and it was necessary to call for an impartial investigation in to the matter.
?The foreign reports claimed the president was involved in a bribery scandal with an Australian company, the Snowy?Mountains?Engineering?Company (SMEC) for the construction of a dam in Sri Lanka in 2009, while he was acting as the Minister of Agriculture,? he added.
Joint opposition member MP Tharaka Balasuriya said they did not believe that the President could be involved in such a scandal. He also said it would be better if a local investigation could be carried out into this matter to clarify these accusations for the country?s sake.
Meanwhile, MP Dissanayake said the Government was carrying out all the ?Mahinda Chinthanaya? projects as it was proved by the continuation of the Port City and The Magampura Mahinda Rajapaksa Port projects.
?The Government is continuing all the profitable and successful projects commenced by the former government. They are not in terms to appreciate them. Instead, they put the blame on the Rajapaksa?s for the down falls of their Government,? he added.
Joint Opposition member MP Widura Wickramanayake said he would not be surprised even if Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe would have been appointed as the common candidate to the Sri Lanka Freedom party (SLFP) at the next presidential election.
He also said at present the SLFP was accorded with the agendas of the United National Party (UNP). (Kalathma Jayawardhane)

12 killed in attack on American University in Kabul
	
Twelve people were killed in an attack on a university in Kabul, the Afghan capital, a spokesman for the Chief of Kabul Police tells CNN.
Seven students, three policemen and two security guards were killed in the attack on the American University campus, Basir Mujahid, the spokesman said.
Around 750 students were on campus at the time, he added.
Police searched the American University of Afghanistan in Kabul early Thursday and killed two attackers who stormed the campus with guns and explosives, Fraidoon Obaidi, chief of Kabul police's criminal investigation department, told AFP early Thursday.
"We have ended our clean-up operation. Two attackers were gunned down," Obaidi said about 10 hours after the assault began.
The gunmen detonated explosives and fired guns, witnesses said, causing some students and faculty to flee. Others hid inside buildings, a senior State Department official told CNN.
No group immediately claimed responsibility. The Afghan government and supporting US officials have battled the Taliban for years. Two professors were abducted recently.
Despite its name, few Americans study at the school, a senior US State Department official told CNN. But a number of Americans serve on the faculty and may have been trapped inside buildings. The school is regarded as a symbol of cooperation between Afghanistan and the United States.
Ahmad Samin said he was teaching a chemistry class Wednesday evening when the assailants struck.
The attackers opened fire and detonated explosives on the campus. Quickly, the lights went out in Samin's classroom.
"It was very dark, (and) everyone was running. Everyone started screaming," said Samin, who is a US citizen. "(It) was the scariest moment in my life. I was just thinking about my son and daughter who are in (the United States)."
Amid black smoke, he took off running with the students and other faculty, and "the smoke entered my mouth" as he fled, he said. (CNN)

Mr. Kiriella said he advocated the position that COPE proceedings should be open to the media for coverage.
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya said Parliamentary Standing Orders would be amended soon providing for it.
Yet, Mr. Kiriella said the current Standing Orders sufficed for it.

LDB?s Siyapath Pubuduwa, a boon to self-employment
	
Lankaputhra Development Bank (LDB) which was established to support and encourage small and medium enterprises with much needed financial assistance in the form of loans has earned a special place among the banking fraternity.?
This is especially due to the Bank?s strong support in encouraging entrepreneurs to move from small and medium sector entrepreneurships to the national level. To cater to this objective and also to get closer to the heart of customers in fulfilling their needs the Bank has launched many attractive loan schemes.
The Chairman of Lankaputhra Development Bank, Lasantha Goonawardena, expressing his views on the operations of the Bank has stated that in keeping with the development goals and strategies of the government the Bank launched Siyapath Pubuduwa to introduce 14,022 entrepreneurs to the nation. Under this program at least one entrepreneur will be introduced from each Grama Niladari Division.?
Siyapath Pubuduwa offers loans to start businesses, modernize existing businesses and to purchase raw materials. Goonawardena also stated that to obtain loans between Rs 100,000 - 500,000, a minimum of two personal guarantors would be sufficient. However if the loan amount is more than Rs. 500,000 a security bond is needed. ?
The government?s recent move in launching a program to increase the contribution of youth for national development, simply reinforces the Bank?s vision and Lankaputhra Development Bank, fulfilling its national duty has developed special loans to encourage the youth in starting self-employment projects. ?
The Chairman, also stressed that the new generation of young adults who are starting self-employment projects or are already engaged in self-employment can obtain loans on concessionary interest rates under Siyapath Pubuduwa.?
He also pointed out that there in a marked interest by this generation to start self-employment projects in the areas of repairing electronic items such as computers and mobile phones and beauty culture. Goonawardena said that when rural youth come to work in the cities they cannot save anything from their salary due to a heavy percentage being spent on travel, accommodation and food expenses. As a solution to this problem Lankaputhra Development Bank is planning to encourage youth to start self-employment projects within their own districts. In addition, Siyapath Pubuduwa will give more opportunities to women to get a better contribution from them.?
At present there are many opportunities in the Hospitality and Fisheries sectors. A person engaged in any sector can get a maximum of Rs 20 million. By this initiative the Bank hopes to increase the export income and thereby strengthen the national economy.
Leasing facilities offered by the Bank is very attractive and very prominent in the industry while offering the lowest leasing instalments. Together these facilities offer an excellent opportunity and affordability for the enterprising youth of Sri Lanka to successfully engage and develop their entrepreneurship skills in many industries throughout Sri Lanka.

My father brought in Sinhala only Bill to give country back its identity: CBK
	
Former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga yesterday said her father had brought in the Sinhala only Bill in 1956 not as a racist move but as a means of giving back to the country its identity after 450 years of subjugation by foreign rulers.
?After eight years of independence, the Sinhala people, who accounted for around 75 per cent of the population, felt that they were being discriminated against, not by the Tamil or Muslim people but by the white rulers and they felt they needed to express their identity by regaining an important place for the Sinhala people. What better way to give people an identity than to elevate the status of their language?,? she asked.
Ms. Kumaratunge said both the languages should have been given rightful place without giving its rightful place to the language of the people who made up the majority of the population.
?We only gave the language of the majority its rightful place. We should have given both languages their rightful place,? she said.
Speaking at the launch of the website of Language Facilitators pool at the BMICH, she said leaders of the 1956 government realized a year later that Tamil language must also be given recognition and brought in the Reasonable use of Tamil Bill, but it had not been implemented so far.
?Every successive government in this country excelled in sweeping the Bill under carpet and not giving the Tamil language its rightful place. This has created a situation where we do not have a single person who can speak Tamil or work in Tamil in most government departments and ministries. I looked into this when I became President. However, we had to face practical problems when recruiting Tamil people due to the war,? she said.
"This may be a small initiative but this is the first time that in post-independent Sri Lanka, a government has taken an effort to create an enabling environment to allow citizens to communicate with the government, in their language of choice,? she said.
Minister of National Co-existence, Dialogue and Official Languages Mano Ganesan said the implementation of the language policy, addressing language related issues and implementing them would be a prelude to solving more than half of the ethnic problems in the country.
"A cabinet paper has been put forward to re-assess the selection criteria of recruitment into government services, where there will be further motivation for learning new languages,? he said. (Ajith Siriwardana)

Preliminary studies could have reduced defects in mini hydro-power plants: Gunawardene
	
An accurate preliminary study had not been conducted before building a majority of mini hydro-power plants in the country and therefore, they have defects, senior environmentalist and environmental lawyer Jagath Gunawardena said.
Most of the errors are prima facie defects, he said. ?It is very sad to note that from all the 145 hydro-power plants in the country not even half generate electricity. The reason behind this is that they have no capacity to generate the accepted levels of electricity. They do not have a year round production capacity. At the same time none of them have reviewed the environmental report,? he said.
The mini hydro projects had been initiated by International Non Government Organizations (INGOs) as donations. The concept of mini-hydro power plants were initiated because they were considered as being hundred per cent eco friendly projects. ?The concept was totally wrong as although these INGOs have said there were no Carbon Dioxide (CO2) emissions from mini-hydro power plants, this thought process is wrong?, Mr. Gunawardena said.
He said the electricity generation from mini-hydro power-plants was also not
eco-friendly.
Addressing the media, Professor Ivan De Silva said there were two main environmental institutions which give permission to construct hydro-power plants in the country. One is the Wildlife Conservation Department and the other was the Central Environmental Authority (CEA)
There are 57 mini-hydro power plants other than the anicuts that run through the Mahaweli River. The tower is feeding the downstream, he said. ?If we built a power house to generate one kilowatt, we will lose one kilometre of the extent of a river. Now we have lost 100 kilometres of the Mahaweli River, 29 kilometers were lost from the Kelani River", he said. (Chaturanga Pradeep)

President's office will issue statement on Aussie media reports: Lakshman Yapa
	
The Presidential Secretariat will issue a full statement in the days to come on the news reports published in Sydney Morning Herald, The Age and the Australian Broadcasting Corporation among the Australian media on an alleged attempt to obtain a financial donation from an Australian company for political work by a coordinating secretary of President Maithripala Sirisena when he served as the Minister of Mahaweli Development and Irrigation in 2009, State Finance Minister Laksman Yapa Abeywardana today said .
Responding to a journalist at the weekly news briefing at the SLFP head office yesterday, Minister Abeywardana said it was quite obvious that the attempt was aimed at slinging mud at President Sirisena on a non-existent transaction.
?The Australian media, that made this allegation itself says that however ?no donation was made? at all. In short, there was no transaction into this effect took place,? Minister Abeywardana stressed.
?There was no one who made the alleged donation or the one who obtained it. There was no account number or the name of the bank on which the cash or the cheque deposited. Therefore, there is no case here,? Minister Abeywardana added.
He said however, the government would go deep into this false allegation and the Presidential Secretariat will issue a full statement on the issue.
He asked as to why this false charge was made after seven years if something to that effect actually happened in 2009.
The Australian based Fairfax media alleges that Sirisena and his adviser allegedly demanded a ?political donation? from the Snowy Mountains Engineering Company (SMEC) in return of Sirisena approves the awarding of a World Bank funded dam project when he was the Minister of Mahaweli Development and Irrigation.
Responding to another journalist as to why the government unearths cases of bribery, corruption and embezzling allegedly took place under the Mahinda Rajapksa regime, Minister Abeywardana said there were enough documentary and collaborative evidence to evidence to frame charges against perpetrators who have reportedly involved in those crimes.
?The cases of corruption, bribery and embezzling filed in various courts are prima-facie cases with provable evidence. There are those who paid the bribery and those received it. There are bank accounts, banks and cheques that involved the crime and the purpose of paying the bribe. Therefore, almost all those case filed against corrupt politicians of the previous government are water tight cases. The allegation that has been made against President Sirisena is only a wichful thinking and there is no case here,? Minister Abeywardana emphasized. (Sandun A Jayasekera)

Scottish engineer due in court in SL over nightclub brawl
	
A Scot is due in court in Sri Lanka over a nightclub brawl with the son of a former government minister in the country in 2014.
James Casserly, 44, is expected to appear at court on Wednesday in the south Asian island state along with Malaka Silva and his four bodyguards after they were involved in a fight in a club in 2014.
Silva is the son of Sri Lanka's former minister for public relations and has a reputation in the country for his unruly social life. Silva is banned from a number of night spots, including the one were the fight happened.
Mr Casserly, originally from Shotts in North Lanarkshire, moved to the country's capital Colombo after getting a job as a senior engineer at a manufacturing firm in 2013.
He went with his partner Belinda Mackenzie to a Halloween party at a nightclub while staying in the city and became involved in a confrontation after Ms Mackenzie was allegedly harassed by Silva, who was banned from the venue over previous incidents there.
Mr Casserly says he reacted after Silva groped his girlfriend then attacked her when she pushed him away.
The Scots says he struck Silva but was thrown to the floor by his bodyguards who repeatedly kicked and stamped on him until he was unconscious. He lost his job as a result of the investigation and says his life, and that of his partner, has been adversely affected.
Now he is seeking "justice" and closure with the case dragging on for around two years without reaching court.
Mr Casserly told STV News: "After I stuck him (Silva) the bodyguards grabbed me and kicked me around until I was unconscious.
"My partner was left with pretty bad anxiety after it and I lost my job. It was a big money job and that's gone because of this. We've lost a lot. It's all because of this guy.
"There were so many witnesses so the case kept on getting put back and delayed. But they seem to have gathered all the evidence now so I'm just glad it's coming up but I wouldn't be surprised if there is another delay.
"The guy has a reputation as a troublemaker and I've received threats. I've been offered compensations but I want justice."
Mr Casserly will stand accused along with Silva and his four bodyguards. Two ministerial police also faced charges in the case but they have been dropped.
The Scots engineer will be accompanied by a representative from the British High Commission. (stv.tv)
