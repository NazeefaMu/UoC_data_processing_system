A flourishing coconut plantation, but the yield, one nut per tree a year
	

A white collar high-up of an establishment controlling public finance who is also holding high office in a state-owned company based in Wayamba has come under a death threat from a Diyawanna member hailing from the same province.

The white collar high-up incurred the wrath of the Diyawanna when he got audits to go through the accounts relating to the annual income from a flourishing coconut plantation managed by the Wayamba-based state-owned company. The coconut estate several thousands of acres in extent had been under the direct management of the Diyawanna member for several years in the past. And the audit had revealed that according to the accounts on record for the period of the stewardship of the Diyawanna member one coconut tree had yielded only one coconut a year.
When the white collar high-up was carrying out an investigation into the glaring embezzlement, an anonymous caller had threatened him and abused him in filth. However, he had had the presence of mind to record this threatening call.
The white collar one had reported this matter to his superiors at the Ministry and the latter had advised him to make a complaint to Police as it was obvious as to who was behind the threat.
However, when he appraised the political authority in charge of the subject, the latter had told him: Dont make any complaint to the Police. I dont think the member would make such a threat over the phone Leave the matter in my hands
Despite the promise held out by the political authority, the politico has not stopped his intimidatory tactics.
And the white collar one has now decided to quit his high office in the state-owned company, informed sources say.

A hiccup that marred the glittering ceremony
	

It was a glittering awards ceremony and the venue was a super theatre hall. The spacious hall was packed with film stars, artistes from all other fields of art, leading politicians and VIPs from various other sectors in national life.

The chief guest, a very high political authority in the country was a bit late in arriving for the grand event.
When the chief guest entered the hall, a high-up of the institution that organized the event was addressing the distinguished gathering. He did not appear to have noticed the arrival of the most distinguished guest and continued to hold forth regardless. He presently concluded his self-congratulatory commentary and handed over the mike to a cinema artiste who was the master of ceremonies.
The cinema artiste blew into the mike as usual and was about to start speaking when the sound system went haywire. The volume of the system suddenly increased to an ear-splitting pitch. The distinguished guests seated in the front row looked highly disconcerted. Meanwhile, an obscenity escaped from the lips of the highly agitated sound control technician and unfortunately the filth he uttered involuntarily, sounded loud over the public address system for all and sundry to hear it clearly!
Everyone present including the chief guest looked highly embarrassed and some guests grimaced with disgust.
The high political authority later rebuked the media personality who had invited him to the ceremony that turned into a poor show, they say.

CDB heralds exceptional financial performance on 20th anniversary
	

Celebrating its 20th anniversary as a harbinger of change and trailblazing forerunner in the Non-bank financial institution (NBFI) sector in Sri Lanka, Citizens Development Business Finance PLC (CDB) reported exceptional financial results for FY 2015/16, revelling in its innovative persona, corporate stewardship and incomparable team.
The entitys impressive track record in sustainable financial performance has built a robust and resilient foundation that has enabled the company to be fearless and holistic in its approach. This was well evidenced in the recognition it received from the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce which placed CDB among the Ten Best Corporate Citizens of 2015 and the winner in the Below Rs.5 billion Revenue Category, two feats that were added to the ever increasing kudos that CDB continues to collate.
CDB Managing Director/CEO Mahesh Nanayakkara articulates that CDB has affirmed its strong presence even more with this years results. CDBs reputation as a financial entity that has continued to be consistent in its financial performance is well demonstrated in the impressive milestones we notched this year. The balance sheet surpassed the Rs.50 billion mark, detailed at Rs.50.6 billion and reflecting a growth of 33 percent, positioning CDB among the largest NBFIs in the country.
He detailed that profit after tax too showcased a remarkable upward trajectory, positioning itself beyond the Rs.1 billion milestone, which is a growth of 43 percent. Revenue is recorded at Rs.7.5 billion, inclining 8 percent.
Net interest income is recorded at Rs.3 billion, which is an increase of 7 percent, while impairment charges and disposal deficits are Rs.399 million, reflecting a reduction of Rs.281 million or by 41 percent. The loan book recorded a growth of 31 percent standing at Rs.38.5 billion. The narrowing of net interest margins from 8.0 percent to 6.9 percent in comparison to last year was a result of the conscious strategy adopted by CDB to change the composition of the lending mix.
The direct positive outcome of this strategy has been that both gross and net non-performing loan ratios reduced from 5.8 percent to 3.6 percent and 3.2 percent to 1.6 percent, respectively, which resulted in the reduction of impairment charges. The deposit base grew by 14 percent to be posted at Rs.30.8 billion, while debt funding, which became the main source of funding, heralded a growth of Rs.7.5 billion, an increase of an impressive 156 percent. Cost to income ratio stood at 57.58 percent
Total equity surpassed the Rs.5 billion mark, while Tier I and Tier II in the capital adequacy ratios stood at 11.72 percent and 11.74 percent, respectively, well above regulatory requirements. The liquidity ratio at 20.04 percent too was above the regulatory requirement level. Ninety one percent of assets are in interest bearing regular cash flow generating investments including the asset backed loan book consisting of 76 percent of assets.
Profit before VAT on financial services, NBT and the crop levy is notched at Rs.1.43 billion, stipulating an incline of 36 percent, where profit before income tax stands at Rs.1.25 billion. This is an increase of 32 percent. Return on equity recorded 21.78 percent, while earnings per share stands at Rs.18.51. The net book value per share is now Rs.93.03 as per the balance sheet date.
CDBs specialized leasing subsidiary changed its name to Unisons Capital Leasing Ltd (UCL) during the year. CDB fully subscribed to the rights issue announced by UCL during the FY 2015/16 investing Rs.82.1mn at Rs.10.50 per share, which increased CDBs stake in UCL to 90.38 percent. For this financial year, UCL contributed Rs.15.6 million towards the groups consolidated results. Judging by the positive trends already experienced, we expect UCL to make a significant contribution to the groups bottom line in the coming years.

Diplomats jibe, an eye opener for the government
	

A certain Centre tasked with planning the policies of the state had recently organized a special lecture.

Only a small select group of intellectuals and academics in the country had been invited to this lecture. The guest speaker was an envoy from a Red country.
The envoy represents a country that acts in close co-operation with the Sri Lankan government in regard to most international issues. In fact, the leaders of the government of that country were closer to the leadership of the former regime than to that of the present one.
The diplomat in his talk made an interesting reference to the present government and our team of Ministers. The effect of what he said is as follows: Dear friends. We have found it difficult to understand the policies of this government. I wonder whether even the senior Ministers understand them. I understand that there are about 92 Ministers, Deputy Ministers and State Ministers functioning in this government. If one wants to form at least a rough idea about the policies of this government, one may have to meet each of these 92 Ministers. But getting a correct answer from them would prove a difficult proposition
Purohitas and other invitees could not hide their embarrassment on hearing the scathing comment made by the Red diplomat. However, one of the purohitas present had remarked that the envoys comment is an eye opener for this government.

Kithuruwan, Ramith in trouble after night brawl
	
The careers of promising cricketers Kithuruwan Vithanage and Ramith Rambukwella are in jeopardy with Sri Lanka Cricket pursuing disciplinary action against the duo over a breach of discipline.
Both are most likely to be withdrawn from the forthcoming Sri Lanka A tour of England as Sri Lanka Cricket is serious about upholding discipline.
Former Test cricketer Vithanage known for his off-field frolics rather than on-field heroics was named in the Sri Lanka A limited over side while Rambukwella  the former Sri Lanka T20 player  was named for both limited over and 4-day series against English Lions.
However both Vithanage and Rambukwella face disciplinary hearing after a late night brawl at a leading hotel in Battaramulla recently.
We are taking this issue very seriously. We will most likely withdraw them from the tour, a top SLC official said on the condition of anonymity. The disciplinary committee is currently pursuing the matter.
After the alleged incident, Vithanage was rushed to a private hospital with injuries and missed few days of training ahead of the tour.
Vithanage had earlier been warned for a breach of discipline during a Test match in Galle while Rambukwella-- the son of former media minister Keheliya Rambukwella  was cautioned earlier for a disciplinary issue during an U-19 tournament in Colombo.
Vithanage  a left-handed batsman  has featured in 10 Tests and six ODIs for Sri Lanka in his short international career. Sri Lanka A team led by Ashan Priyanjan will leave Sri Lanka on June 22 for the tour. (Champika Fernando)

Police denied allegations made against them by the aggrieved partys counsel and told the court that it had carried out a fair and broad investigation into the matter.
They said that in the absence of sufficient evidence there was no way that Minister Ranawaka could be named as a suspect.
Police said that to conclude the investigation they have to record a statement from the victim, Sandeep Sampath, who is currently being treated at the Ragama Hospital but he is not in a stable health condition to record a statement.

No official residence for Opposition Leader
	
The Government is yet to provide an official residence to Opposition Leader R. Sampanthan despite several ministers occupying official residences while having homes in Colombo and in the suburbs, a senior Public Administration Ministry source said yesterday.
He said this was an injustice meted out to Mr. Sampanthan.
There are dozens of large houses and mansions under private or government ownership reserved as official residences in Colombo and most of them are occupied by ministers at a monthly rental of Rs.100,000 to Rs.250,000. The irony is that many of the ministers occupying these houses also have homes in Colombo or in satellite cities from which they can travel to Parliament or their ministries within an hour, the source told Daily Mirror.
He said many of the ministers do not even occupy these houses.
"In many cases the houses are occupied by the ministers relatives, family members or his or her security personnel. There are even instances where some of the official residences have been rented out for a higher price," the source said.
He said currently there was no official residence for the Opposition Leader and the Public Administration Ministry had drawn the attention of the higher authorities but nothing had happened.
When asked to comment on this matter, Mr. Sampanthan who represents voters in the Trincomalee District, confirmed that he was still to receive an official residence in the City and said he was not prepared to talk about the matter because it was too ugly. (Sandun A Jayasekera)

Public Servants' Concessionary Vehicle Permits increased
	
The Government has increased the concessionary vehicle permits to Public Servants from the current US$25,000 to US$45,000 in a new circular to be issued shortly by the Treasury's Trade and Investment Policy Department.
This follows the recent cabinet decision to re-introduce concessionary vehicle permits to public servants.
The government suspended the Concessionary Vehicle Permits (CVP) in November citing the huge drain on foreign exchange, air pollution and traffic congestion.
Senior public servants like Secretaries, additional Secretaries, Departmental Heads, Directors, District Secretaries, University dons, Chief Secretaries of Provincial Councils are among those eligible for the CVP.
A source said the government had decided to resume the issuance of CVP in three stages.
Under this concession, top public servants like secretaries to the President, Prime Minister and the ministers will be eligible to a permit for US$45,000 while additional secretaries of a ministry and those of similar grades will be entitled to a permit of US$40,000.
At least 2,000 senior public servants had benefited annually since 2010 through this scheme and nearly 10,000 duty-free vehicle permits had been issued to public servants.
The source said a public servant eligible for the CVP would receive his or her first permit after 6 years of service and the second 10 years later. A public servant will be eligible only for two CVP during his or her service period. (Sandun A Jayasekera)

It is the Speaker who appoints members to the COPE when political parties represented in Parliament nominate MPs to the committee. I won't express any views on the appointment of Mr Aluthgamage, he said. The responsibility of nominating MPs of good character lies with the political parties. If the joint opposition is unable to nominate a proper MP that group has to held be responsible to people, he added.
Meanwhile, United National Party (UNP) MP Ranjan Ramanayake, who is also a member of COPE, said he had taken the matter up with Speaker Karu Jayasuriya and expressed his objections to the appointment of Mr. Aluthgamage to COPE.
I discussed this matter with the Speaker and he advised me not leave COPE but to continue the good fight while remaining as one of its members, he said.
Someone like Dinesh Gunawardene or Vasudeva Nanayakkra may have been a better choice as they have a better track record, Mr. Ramanayake said. (Yohan Perera)

Ranil very concerned on probable Brexit
	
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has said Sri Lanka wasvery concerned about the probable impact of a British exit from the European Union (EU).
We are very concerned about the probable impact of a British exit from the EU  on the global economy, on Sri Lanka, and on the UK, the Prime Minister said in an Opinion Article to a British news agency.
Read the full article:
As a politician who was first elected to Government in 1977, I have closely observed key political developments in the global landscape over the past 40 years or so.
To name a few: the Chinese economic reforms initiated by Deng Xiaoping in 1978, which gradually integrated China into the world economy; the economic reforms in India of Prime Minister Narasimha Rao which led to India becoming an impressive regional power; and the establishment of a European single market.
Global stability is of vital importance to us
The outcome of these initiatives was the emergence of a new global economic order promoting open markets and free trade among the key players  the US, the EU, China, Japan and India. Today we all belong to this new global order, in which trade is not confined to national boundaries.
As a result, we are all dependent on the global economy recovering from the financial crisis of 2008.
Global macro-economic stability is of vital importance, for example, to us in Sri Lanka.
After three decades of terrorism, internal conflict and divisive politics, we have embarked on a process of reconciliation, the upholding of human rights, the consolidation of democracy and the strengthening of our economic base by joining the global market.
The outlook for growth has worsened
The success of our strategy to diversify our exports earnings and improve our balance of trade depends on a stable global economy.
Therefore the future of the European single market, which accounts for more than 30 per cent of our export trade  with the balance of trade in our favour  is of critical concern to us, as its disruption would have global consequences.
The IMF Spring Meeting of 2016 concluded that the outlook for global economic growth has worsened, and one of the greatest risks to the health of the global economy is the possible exit of the UK from the EU, which would potentially lead to further financial turbulence.
We in Sri Lanka  as well as many other Asian countries  cannot afford further financial turbulence and another global economic downturn.
So we are very concerned about the probable impact of a British exit from the EU  on the global economy, on Sri Lanka, and on the UK.
Treasury forecast cannot be ignored
The IMFs negative forecasts about the risks of a British exit are reinforced by the UK Treasurys prediction of huge revenue losses to the British government, and the projection that each British citizen would be poorer by 4,300 by 2030.
his Treasury forecast cannot be ignored or cast aside with a few derogatory remarks.
It is a wide-ranging analysis that requires serious consideration. The IMF World Economic Outlook and the Treasury analysis are backed by a large number of other organisations, such as the OECD, the Institute of Fiscal Studies and a range of banks and businesses.
The UK has structured a European single market which gives them the best of both worlds. It is a single market of 500m people incorporating both the Eurozone and a Sterling area  two of the five IMF reserve currencies.
Last year, London overtook New York once again to become the worlds foremost financial centre; the EU is the worlds largest economy, with more than 20 per cent of global GDP.
The economic consequences of the disruption
It is the worlds largest trading bloc, with 15 per cent of the worlds trade in goods and services.
It is also the biggest export market for more than 80 countries, including Sri Lanka.
So the economic consequences of the disruption that could be caused by the UK pulling out of the EU would have an impact even on our part of the world.
Those of you who favour leaving contend that the UK could enter into a series of free trade agreements with the EU, the US, Asia and Commonwealth countries, and thereby cushion the impact of losing access to the European single market.
In Sri Lanka, we suffered the consequences of losing the GSP+, a preferential trade deal with the EU, in the late 2000s. Going by our experience, the adverse impact off a UK pull-out would be far greater.
Today, we, in Sri Lanka, are on the verge of re-applying for the GSP+; we are negotiating an economic and technology agreement with India, and discussing trade deals with China, Singapore and the US.
We have to follow a convoluted path to trade development in which individual negotiations have become our only option, given that a single market for , our region, South Asia, is not feasible.
So I am amazed at a country which seems inclined to throw away its secure present for an uncertain future. Exiting the European single market means standing in a queue while a country like Sri Lanka enters into agreements with the above-named countries.
Financial tumult and economic downturn
Those who promote leaving the EU have not been able to rebut the analyses, which mostly predict financial tumult and economic downturn.
Modern history has no parallel to the dynamics of the UK, a country that built up and maintained economic success, from the days of empire to the European single market.
To leave the EU now would put that very position at risk. It would be, in cricket parlance, a hit wicket, and it is therefore not surprising that your allies and friends have expressed their anxieties and concerns.
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher paid a visit to Sri Lanka 31 years ago, in April 1985.
I was present when President Jayewardene quoted Hamlet to her: he repeated Poloniuss advice to Laertes: Those friends thou hast, and their adoption tried, grapple them unto thy soul with hoops of steel.
The decision the voters of the UK must on 23 June is as momentous as that taken by the wartime government on 28 May 1940, when there were voices calling for negotiation with Germany.
Churchill was cheered for his decision to carry on without changing course. We wish the people of UK all strength to make the correct decision on 23 June.
                                               End

She goes single again
	

A story that has gone viral in political circles says that a dainty fair Diyawanna member from the South has begun a new single life.

A leading newsmaker, this fair member had been lying low in the recent past and was hardly seen in public even when her area was badly hit by massive floods. A storm that ripped through her domestic scene had kept her away from the public eye, they say.
The storm, of course, had begun when a dear one living under the same roof tracked her down to a place in the gem city where the fair one was engaged in a political discussion with a colleague. A heated exchange between the couple had led to a cascade of developments culminating in her decision to go single.
All efforts by friends to bring about a reconciliation had failed and the matter is now lying in the hands of the black-coated gentry. And the fair one has picked a legal expert hailing from a reputed political family who also happens to be a son of a governor.
The fair one highly upset over the domestic problem is not in a frame of mind to continue in politics, informed ones say. However, those interested in getting the information from the horses mouth have found that the fair one has gone incommunicado.

SL's stability, security vital for the region: Turkey
	
Sri Lankas geographical location is a strategic one and therefore, the country's security and stability was vital for the region and beyond, visiting Turkish Foreign Affairs Minister Mevlt avusoglu said today.
He expressed these views to the media at the Foreign Affairs Ministry after signing an MOU between the two Foreign Ministries on Diplomatic Training, Exchange of Information and Documentation.
Minister avusoglu, the first ever Turkish Foreign Minister to visit Sri Lanka, expressed optimism that his visit would help open new dimensions in bilateral relationships between the two countries and said their President Recep Tayyip Erdogan was also keen on making a state visit to Sri Lanka within this year.
The geographical distance between our two nations has not prevented us from building a dynamic relationship between our two countries. Sri Lanka has extended its assistance to the Syrian and Iraqi refugees in Turkey in the recent past, a gesture which is very much appreciated. We expressed our condolences to the families that went through so much hardship as a result of the recent floods in Sri Lanka and want to assure you that we will stand by Sri Lanka during good times and in bad, he said.
The minister said the government of Turkey welcomed the Sri Lankan governments efforts in the field of reconciliation and announced that the two countries had agreed to increase economic corporation in the fields of security, culture, tourism, agriculture, energy, education and health.
Meanwhile, Foreign Affairs Minister Mangala Samaraweera said the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) along with greater interaction between the two foreign offices would ensure stronger ties in all spheres of cooperation between the two states.
He said Minister avusoglu's visit comes at a significant time as the government is rebalancing Sri Lankas relations with the international community based on the spirit on openness. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Tears over the splitting of the subject of Housing
	

This is a story about housing. The second in command in yahapalanaya had recently split the subject of housing into two new subjects  as urban housing and village housing and assigned the two new subjects to two separate purohitas.

The purohita who was assigned the village housing was very unhappy over the sub-division of the housing subject and had insisted the other day that he be assigned urban housing as well. My portfolio would lose its meaning, if plantation housing is given to one person and urban housing to another, he had argued.
A high-powered conference was held later at the nerve centre of yahapalanaya to iron out problems relating to the overall subject of housing and the second in command chaired this conference.
The unhappy purohita at this conference too pointed the feasibility of bringing housing in all sectors under his charge.
However, the second in command in the chair was not prepared to budge an inch from the position he took up. Mega Polis is a project we introduced. So we have to leave urban housing in the hands of Mega Polis authorities. So you continue to handle village housing, said the second in command in a tone of finality.

They are set to tame a bull in a China shop
	

A battle cry is being raised against the bull in a china-shop- conduct of a secretarial one at a key office in yahapalanaya by the concerned parties, they say.

This secretarial one had visited several media institutions and held discussions with the employees without either the permission or the participation of the management of these institutions, they say.
Meanwhile, the heads of several media institutions had taken a decision at a special meeting held the other day to declare the premises of their institutions out of bounds for the white collar one.
The track-record of this secretarial one shows that he had always been a controversial figure, they say. For instance, he had got involved in a clash when he was functioning as the head of a media institution during the previous regime and was subjected to a severe beating. He also got egg on his face quite recently when he issued an official communique no sooner than he had assumed his new office which triggered an immediate backlash.
Media heads are now set to make a joint complaint against the secretarial one to the second in command in yahapalanaya, they say.

They foiled the attempt to remove the power generators
	

The army personnel who wereattached to the security unit provided to the former strongman were recently withdrawn by the government on a recommendation made by the Security Council.

When the army personnel are withdrawn, the security-related equipment used by them are also removed. This is a normal practice.
When the army detail was providing security to the former strongman, there was one power generator installed at the latters Tangalle residence and the Medamulana ancestral home for emergency use. The generators were purchased by the Presidential Secretariat, they say. However, some people had planned to remove the two generators as well soon after the army detail was withdrawn.
A wedding of the Rajapaksa family had taken place recently. On this day, a gentleman in khaki uniform had come to the Medamulana residence carrying spanners and wrenches and had begun dismantling the generator installed in the house. On hearing about this, a group from the Rajapakasa clan had rushed to the Medamulana residence and staged a big commotion aborting the attempt to remove the generator and reported the matter to the high authorities as well. Later it had transpired that certain parties had taken the initiative to remove the two generators in a bid to win brownie points from the powers that be, they say.

They smell a rat
	

The advent of yahapalanaya marked the dawn of a golden era for this young businessman affectionately called Podimahattaya thanks to the right connection to a lokumahattaya.

Some purohitas say that they do not grudge the sudden turn of the wheel of fortune in the young chaps favour, but they are really concerned about the kind of business activity he is deeply involved in.
Meanwhile, a powerful purohita has discovered an exploit of podimahattaya. The young man has purchased an aircraft manufactured by a Japanese company. It is parked in an airport in the city of the Lion which the family members often visit, he confided in his colleagues.
Aney, dont make false allegations against that boy, another purohita had said. It must be a toy plane for him to play with!
