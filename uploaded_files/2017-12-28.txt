A device that converts decaying Garbage into fuel and bio-gas
	
A Korean company is in the hope of introducing a machine that can be used for converting the decaying garbage into diesel, petrol, gas or bio-coal, by adding a special stimulator, within 3 seconds.?
Any degradable material except stones, glass and iron can be used for conversion with the use of this machine. It is a miraculous effort that a source of energy can be produced as a solution to the garbage which is snowballing into epidemic proportions the world over.? ?
The Korean National and Foreign Consultant to the Sri Lanka Social Insurance Board, Kim Duk Ju has taken the initiative of introducing this machine to the countries in the world including Sri Lanka. These are the excerpts of the conversation the journalists had with him regarding his new invention.? ?
?Fuel is produced the world over using plastics, wax and polythene etc. We have introduced a machine for manufacturing fuel and coal from garbage similar to the standard and the quality of those fuels. We were able to invent this machine with the patronage of the Korean government as a result of the long-term research done within 15 years.???
?By putting a kilo of garbage into this machine, petrol, diesel, gas or bio-coal can be obtained within 3 seconds. This machine has the ability of producing 50% of energy source out of the garbage used for this purpose. We should really convert garbage into a treasure. What was done in earlier days were burying,? burning or making compost fertilizer with garbage. It takes much time. Sometimes, the result was not so good as well.???
He said further that countries such as America, China and Germany have made requestes for the patent for this machine which was invented by the Veepel Group of Companies in Korea. He said that this machine was introduced to the world with the assistance of this company.? ?
According to him, the garbage that is put into this machine is converted into very tiny pieces instantly with the stimulator in the scientific process and fuel, gas or bio-coal are produced as required. He pointed out that countries such as China and Japan produce fuel using materials like plastics, polythene and wax, and although it was a matter for wonder, the composition of chemical compounds such as carbon, hydrogen and oxygen would take place.? ?
He said triumphantly that it was not the garbage that is available in Meethotamulla, but money. He pointed out the statement made by the Maldives minister that all garbage that is afloat the sea had been washed ashore to the Maldives. When he introduced this machine to them, they said that money was drifting to their country, according to him. He said that dirt is smeared with the clothes of the people so long as they live and he assured that the bio-coal produced by this machine is of good quality and quantity and they can be used for the production of electricity at the Norochcholai Power Plant without any difficulty.? ?
He said further, ?the garbage can be put into this machine even separately. It can produce 88% diesel or petrol from the quantity that is put into the machine by using plastics only and 10.5% gas and 2.4% bio-coal. If only wood is used, 55.2% diesel and petrol, 15.2% gas, 23.9% bio-coal can be produced. 76.1% diesel or petrol, 11.8% gas, 9.7% bio-coal can be produced using a mixture of plastics and wood. The fuel produced by this machine is similar to the fuel that is available in the market. We have done several researches and proved its capability.?? ?

A melody for a milieu From Hubert to Clarence
	
As an art form, as a means of self-expression and articulation, music is largely self-referential. It has nothing outside itself; the standards and the yardsticks created for it, by various exogenous factors, are subsumed, sometimes eventually, almost always at once.?
This is why of all the art forms we are acquainted with now, music is the least easy, and the most difficult, to propagandise. The moving image and the live theatre thrive on the mediation of two levels of consciousness; that of the performer and that of the spectator. As such it?s easy and despicably so to elevate those levels of consciousness by resorting to a message, whether that act of elevation debases rather than elevates the art itself being a topic for another debate. Music, in any case, is purely a product of its milieu, the milieu that manufactures and then consumes it. The act of consumption, in other words, is no different to the act of production; there can be no mediation between the two, only a levelling down of any and every barrier.??
Part of the reason for this, of course, is the comparatively frugal economic base that can sustain a song or for that matter an orchestral performance. The movies will always remain the most industrial of all art forms, reliant on technology in ways that no other art form can hope to match, but the advent of digitalisation and web helped liberate music from the opera house and the concert hall in much the same way that the blogosphere and YouTube helped disseminate criticism and the moving image. The dichotomy between production and consumption that you come across in the cinema, television and of course literature is simply not there in the realm of music.??
The transformation of our cultural sphere, from a largely esoteric affair reserved for the colonial elite to the more plebeian catalogue of art forms (cinema, theatre, literature, etc) after 1956, and the revolution it wrought, went hand in hand with an explicit need to liberate those art forms
The evolution?
And because such a dichotomy does not exist, the milieu to which the producer ? the vocalist, the lyricist, and the composer ? belongs is roughly also the milieu to which the audience, despite any personal quirks individual members may have, belongs as well. The 20th and 21st centuries, with its differentiation between production houses and opera houses, with its democratisation of an entire art, helped sharpen this unique quality, which is how in Sri Lanka you can trace the evolution from the high-flown, high-strung rhetoric of the old composers ? who derived their inspiration from the Parsee theatre and a mishmash of Hela Sinhala and several Indian languages, in their songs and musical pieces ? to the Pop quality, low key to some, of Neville Fernando, Clarence Wijewardena, and closer to our time, Bathiya and Santhush and Sanuka Wickramasinghe. It is this latter pop sensibility that I wish to explore in some detail here, because in their milieu we see an interesting phenomenon being played out.??
The transformation of our cultural sphere, from a largely esoteric affair reserved for the colonial elite to the more plebeian catalogue of art forms (cinema, theatre, literature, etc) after 1956, and the revolution it wrought, went hand in hand with an explicit need to liberate those art forms from the straitjacket of verbal and visual profundities (which were really, at the end of the day, shallow and hollow) indulged by, inter alia, the plays of John de Silva and Sirisena Wimalaweera, the novels of Piyadasa Sirisena and W. A. de Silva, and the cinema of the Minerva Players. Kadawunu Poronduwa begins with a tableau which culminates with the death of the main character Ranjani?s (Rukmani Devi) father; this tableau, in which the individual characters are identified with reference to their race and social position, reflected the verbosities that our filmmakers, playwrights, and writers in general liked to go for. It is with W. D. Amaradeva that we see a much needed toning down of those verbosities, with his attempts at linking the literary with the romantic through his sarala gee canon.??
Retrospective review
In a retrospective review of Rekava and Maname, written for the Lanka Guardian in 1982, Regi Siriwardena, our foremost critic writing in English, contended that contrary to the belief held at the time, Sarachchandra?s plays (especially Maname) initially appealed, not to the poor, but to a class that had been left out (absented) by every Government until then; the middle class Sinhala speaking bourgeoisie. This was not really a bourgeoisie, rather a petit bourgeoisie aspiring to be the bourgeoisie, who would patronise the moral exhortations, at times chauvinistic, at times explicitly archaic, echoed in not just Sarachchandra?s early plays, but also the work of the Colombo Poets and the moralistic yet romantic films of L. S. Ramachandran (Deiyange Rate, Kurulubedda, Sikuru Tharuwa). Eventually this petit bourgeoisie, alluded to as a distinct social subset by Ajith Samaranayake in a tribute to Camillus Perera, congealed into a class who called the shots in our cultural spheres. Amaradeva was their icon, their manifest destiny. They would have been nothing without him.
Amaradeva was the peak and the grand culmination of a trend that began with Devar Surya Sena, whose attempts at compounding our traditional sivpada and pal kavi with the grandiosity of the opera and the Church service were criticised as imitative by Sarachchandra and warmly reflected on by Tissa Abeysekara (indicating the manifest differences of opinion Sena?s work compelled and continues to?compel today).?
Those who laid the groundwork for the later masters ? including Hubert Rajapakse, whose eloquent recitation of Danno Budunge, misconceived as a Buddhist song by our nationalists, would find its pivot decades later with Kishani Jayasinghe (only this time provoking, not infatuation, but hatred) ? were not fully aware of what they were doing.??
Buddhist ethos?
From these two masters we come to Ananda Samarakoon and Sunil Shantha. Rajapakse and Sena were scions of the Anglican elite, who reflected a sensibility different to the more vernacular community from which the latter two hailed. Shantha in particular, who extensively resorted to the piano and organ (a staple of the Catholic Church) in his work (including his tribute to Munidasa, ?Kumarathungunge?), did not have a polished voice that could reckon with the past masters, and neither did Samarakoon, but they were truly, deeply connected with the Buddhist ethos which they went to in some form or the other (Samarakoon converted to Buddhism, while Shantha, a fervent Catholic, in his later phase pared down his melodies to invoke the unmusical intonations of the Buddhist faith, particularly with ?Po Da Daham Sihile?). The shift from the Anglican elite to the Catholic poor was essential at this juncture because it opened up a crevice that would be filled, after 1956, by the baila and the calypso singer: from Neville Fernando (?Gayana Gayum?) to Paul Fernando (?Golu Hadawatha Vivara Karanna?). Amaradeva was more or less a product of all these.??
?At the heart of the baila and calypso that preceded Amaradeva was a contradiction, particularly with the two foremost second generation singers, M. S. Fernando and Anton Jones. Their lyrics, which are for the most devoted to their own workings and rhythms and nonsensical shades of meaning, articulate a dichotomy between a life of luxury and ease and enjoyment and the lack of any money or financial security which was needed to maintain such a life.? ?
Clarence pandered to the milieu which, while shirking the proletarian (if one can use that term) and self-indulgent ethic of the second generation baila vocalists, enthralled the milieu which produced them (the petit bourgeoisie, the middle class, the thuppahi) by bringing about a fusion between their low key sensibilities and the sensibility that thrived on a more literary, witty, and meaningful conception of music. For it to work, and for it to ensnare the consumerist, hedonistic middle class (Buddhist or Catholic, located predominantly in the metropolis), however, the songs that Clarence put out had to subsist on a class rift between the householder and the servant. It is this rift, which you come across in ?Mango Kalu Nande? and ?Mame Ape Kalu Mame?, which earned Clarence, the Moonstones, and the Super Golden Chimes their place in the sun. They were poking fun at a way of life they had got out of, a way of life Anton Jones celebrated, a way of life they attributed to their helpers, their maids, their aayas.??
In the end, therefore, by parodying them, he parodied the men and women we wanted to be. This curious paradox ? between our affections for and repudiation of them ? became its own standard, its own yardstick. And our own standard, our own yardstick.??

CEA to construct 4 sanitary landfills
	
The Central Environmental Authority (CEA) is hoping to construct four large-scale sanitary landfills across the country as a measure to resolve the solid waste issue.
CEA Deputy Director General (Waste Management) Eng. J. M. U. Indraratne said the project would be initiated with funds from the Korean Government obtained as a concessionary loan.
The four sanitary landfills are to be constructed at Keerimale in Jaffna, Keerakkulama in Anuradhapura, Meegaswewa in Polonnaruwa and Monrovia Estate in Galle with the CEA having already carried out the preliminary studies and the Environmental Impact Assessment Report (EIAR) prepared for the four sanitary landfills.
Mr. Indraratne said the cost of constructing the four landfills had not been calculated as yet but the CEA hoped to award the contract before March next year. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

Central Bank absolutely corrupt and inefficient: Ravi
	
Former Foreign Affairs Minister Ravi Karunanayake, in an interview with Daily Mirror, said that the Central Bank is absolutely corrupt and inefficient.
MP Karunanayake, who resigned from his ministerial portfolio over allegations related to the Central Bank bond scam, said the truth will prevail after the report is out.
He refused to deal with allegations against him at length in the interview. Instead, he said he would discuss them after the report was released by the Bond Commission.
He said the biggest problem faced by him and the current Finance Minister was the Central Bank, which is absolutely corrupt and inefficient.
?It has stooges of the former governor. No amendment has been made to correct it. You could see it by its performance. You see the economic growth rate coming down to 3.4%, the inflation rising to 8.4%. These are what the opposition would like to see. These are the elements that ran the economy down then. The govt has changed, but not the officials. They are detrimental to the economy of the country,? he said.
He said ?these Central Bank people? live in cocoons and try to toe the agendas of other people. ?I say it with absolute responsibility that crooks are still remaining there,?he said.? (Kelum Bandara)

Central Bank is absolutely corrupt and inefficient  - Ravi Karunanayake
	
Former Foreign Affairs Minister Ravi Karunanayake, who resigned from office over allegations related to the Central Bank bond scam, spoke to Daily Mirror. He said the truth will prevail after the report is out. He refused to deal with allegations against him at length in the interview. Instead, he said he would discuss them after the report was released by the Bond Commission. Ravi Karunanayake also wished a happy new year for all Sri Lankans. The excerpts:? ? ?
Proposed Presidential Commission on SriLankan and Mihin should be target-oriented
	I am running across the country to ensure victory for the UNP
	It is peculiar where guys who act against corruption are targeted?
	CBSL responsible for bad performance of Govt.
	I was victimized by a handful in Govt.
?
Q You remained somewhat silent after resignation from being a minister. What are your responsibilities as a politician now?
I do not think I have been silent. I have been running across the country for the party. You can see how we are flying the UNP flag and motivating people amidst all unfair publicity against the party. We have completed the nomination period now. You will be able to see the results at the election.? ?
Q You said the UNP is subjected to unfair criticism. Who is doing it in your view?
Well, you would know there was a time when the government was solidly doing without fanfare. You have to compare the current situation with the past. It was only family-oriented rule at that time. Now, we are doing things without fanfare.? ?
?
Q You talked about your responsibilities in the party; what are you doing in the govt?
As for the govt, there was a new political culture. There is a media circus that was created. When I got out of the Cabinet, I could not be doing the work of the govt. I am doing what the party needs; assisting our backbenchers.? ?
?
Q There were reports that you were in charge of the execution of some projects. How true were they?
What is wrong in that?? ?
?
Q Could you please elaborate on the kind of work you do in this respect?
We do monitoring for the party and the MPs. We are getting things done.? ?
?
The Central Bank has run into a 2.1 bn loss this year. It had profits right throughout the years in the past. Sri Lanka has paid Rs. 495 million in legal fees alone related to the hedging transaction and lost the case. These are the matters that were swept under the carpet
?
Q You played a major role in unseating the previous govt. What do you think of the performance of this govt?
Well, I was in the govt. I am still critical about corruption. It is the biggest problem. Corruption is going on at different levels. At the top level, we were the guys who went against corruption. Here, it is a situation where the very same guys who voice against corruption are targeted rather than capturing those who are engaged in corrupt activities. On that context, I remain to be a vocal critic. It has actually been a media circus to hang people rather than by the judiciary. I respect the commissioners (members of the Bond Commission) who had a tough task.? ?
?
Q Do you feel that you were named and shamed by some with vested interests?
Absolutely. It is by some also within the govt; a handful of them. They basically put unfair pressure on the President and the Premier when they are trying to do their best for the country.? ?
?
Q You worked hard for the formation of this govt. What do you feel about what had happened to you under the very same govt?
I do not live on politics and it does not matter. Before long, the truth will prevail. We will be able to say what it is. They are basically a set of inefficient people carrying telltales. The main thing is the govt should be efficient in decision- making and implementation.? ?
?
Q Now, the MoU between the UNP and SLFP will soon expire. What is the way forward after that from your point of view?
The best thing is for the two parties to work together. Also, there are people, with vested interests and past practices, not allowing the country to move out of the mess. Basically, the PM and the President must work as closely as possible and get rid of such elements. You do not need 100 people to run the govt. You just need five or six people. The rest must be merrymaking.? ?
?
Q Do you believe that the two sides should part their political ways now?
I think we strove to get them together. We won the Presidential Elections initially. I think the dead goats must be pruned out. We must be a target-oriented govt.? ?
?
Q You presented three budget proposals, including the one for the 100-day period. We had a budget by the new Finance Minister and it is a departure from your practice. What do you feel?
I do not think it is up to me to comment on it. I wish all the best for the budget. If you compare what we had done and what we had achieved, you would see we did the rock-solid thing to bring the downtrodden economy to the current situation. We meaningfully increased the revenue from 10.4% to 15% of the GDP. We were able to bring revenue to the state coffers that were leaking into other areas otherwise. We were able to bring haphazard spending of the govt to meaningful, policy-oriented projects. It is not ethical for me to comment on the current budget.? ?
The biggest problem faced by me and the current Finance Minister is the Central Bank, which is absolutely corrupt and inefficient. It has stooges of the former governor. No amendment has been made to correct it. You could see it by its performance. You see the economic growth rate coming down to 3.4%, the inflation rising to 8.4%. These are what the opposition would like to see. These are the elements that ran the economy down then. The govt has changed, but not the officials. They are detrimental to the economy of the country.? ?
These Central Bank people live in cocoons and try to toe the agendas of other people. I say it with absolute responsibility that crooks are still remaining there.? ?
?
Q Do you think the economic downfall was caused by the corruption at the CBSL, and not by the poor performance of the govt?
Absolutely. There are the fiscal policy and the monetary policy. We have implemented the fiscal policy successfully by increasing revenue from 10.2% to 15%. But the monetary policy left in these so-called economic pundits, is basically running down. Politicians are not always economists, accountants and so on. It is a handful of them who are responsible. The majority are hard-working.? ?
?
Q The CBSL remains under the purview of the PM. Why has the govt failed to correct the situation?
It is a different matter that the CB is under the PM. The CB has autonomy. The poor PM is also not kept informed of what goes on. I am telling that with factualness. The PM takes the blame for what he was not consulted even. The Central Bank has run into a 2.1 billion loss this year. It had profits right throughout the years in the past. Sri Lanka has paid Rs. 495 million in legal fees alone related to the hedging transaction and lost the case. These are the matters that were swept under the carpet.??
?
Q How are you going to address the matter in the future?
I think we have to wait for the Bond Commission report. When the truth comes out, it would prevail. From there onwards, we would get these things into proper shape. Half of these are fabricated allegations. I think the commissioners are wise enough to see things.? ?
?
Q Are you confident that you would be cleared of all allegations?
I do not want to comment on something. There is a political decision. Let?s wait! Then, we would see how we move forward. Then, we could have another interview.??
?
Q What are the kinds of responsibilities assigned to you in view of the local govt elections?
I want to ensure that the UNP wins handsomely and its members elected to all the councils everywhere. All of us, under the leadership of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, assist each other for the victory of the party.? ?
This is the first govt that questions itself. There was a corrupt govt that was there for ten years. We have paid out Rs.90 billion because of the hedging deal. Had there been a single question about that? Nobody is questioning Mihin Lanka.??
We must ensure that we have ministers who are working, not talking. The President and the PM will move towards 2018 with a sense of purposefulness.? ?
?
The biggest problem faced by me and the current Finance Minister is the Central Bank, which is absolutely corrupt and inefficient. It has stooges of the former governor. No amendment has been made to correct it
?
Q What is your opinion on the President holding talks with the Joint Opposition?
The two lines on the railroad cannot meet together at any particular point. Their thinking is different. How can you get two lines of the railway meeting together???
?
?
Q What do you think of the President who is trying to appoint another Commission to probe Mihin Lanka and SriLankan Airlines?
The Bond Commission was appointed. It is coming to an end and you would see the results. The other Commission to probe SriLankan should have happened as soon as we came to power. If it happens well after three years, it is good. But, it has to be ensured that it is time-targeted, but not run like a mockery that was done to senior ministers like me. It has to be target-oriented and must get to the point.? ?

CERT/CC warns beware of Social Media ?Samaritans?
	
The majority of the people in the country use social media such as Facebook, WhatsApp, Viber, and Twitter which give them easy access for communication. People use social media for personal interest while others do so to maintain connections with people in other parts of the world.? ?
Users prefer Facebook for personal interests like earning a living, which is often legal but sometimes illegal.? ?
There are also Facebook users who cheat people. These helpless people are initially added as friends before they are duped!? ?
Several incidents have been reported in the past to the Computer Emergency Readiness Team-Co-ordination Center (CERT|CC) in connection with cheating incidents on Facebook.? ?
Check the availability of the international parcel delivery agents with the received delivery agents? images. After several investigations CERT/CC found out that the Facebook cheaters and the bogus Custom officers were from Sri Lanka
The? contacted CERT/CC Principal Information Security Engineer Roshan Chandragupta to obtain more details regarding online frauds and crimes on social media.? ?
Chandragupta said that the majority of the people in the country have social media accounts.? ?
?Most of them use Facebook to connect with friends,? he said.? ?
However he said that with regard to many account holders, who had a myriad of friends, most friends were not known to them personally.? ?
Cheats? ?
He said that the CERT/CC has received complaints where Facebook users have been cheated or defrauded. These cheats have used Facebook to obtain presents and later held the account holders to ransom.? ?
Some fraudsters using Facebook accounts appear to be genuine foreigners. They often provide a full profile background.? ?
First they send friend requests and try to build confidence. If the friend request is accepted they will next move on to chat, share images and even sent wishes and gifts to build confidence in this relationship.? ?
Most of these criminals are inclined towards building close friendships and pretend to be caring.? ? They share every pain, sorrow and happiness in their lives and provide social media users with advice. Shortly thereafter, the criminals send boxes containing presents such as electrical items and jewellery among other things.?
These fraudsters will also say that some amount of money has also been put into a gift parcel to pay in the instance it has to be cleared at the customs department.??
Then they will share the pictures of what is being sent- the parcel with its packing and postage bills. Once they post the parcel they ?post? a message on Facebook saying that the person had posted a parcel which included foreign currency, the latter being included to pay the bill at the customs department.? ?
Later, they send an SMS stating that the customs department had received a parcel and it could be released only after paying duties. They also send a local bank account number to pay the tax. According to complaints received, the victims had credited the given account with sums like Rs. 20,000, Rs.30,000, Rs.40,000 and Rs.80,000 respectively.? ?
The? start of troubles? ?
After the victim pays the tax, he or she will receive another call after a couple of days. A person who claims to be a customs officer then says that the parcel that was received contains undeclared foreign currency, possession of which is illegal. The caller says that the parcel had been seized by the customs department after it went through the scanner. He then requests the victim to release the currencies within a certain period of time after declaring it to the customs officials.The fraudster then asks the victim to pay a Customs duty worth Rs.150,000 to the account number, which details he or she had sent earlier. The criminal would say that the foreign currencies sent with the gift parcel were more than the customs duties.? ?
Then the criminal would demand the victim to compensate the expenses incurred and to keep the change. Meanwhile, another caller, claiming to be the agent delivering the parcel, requests the victim to pay money soon, as he was unable to attend duty for a long time and he had to send details of delivery conformation to the head office. If the victim tries to contact the bogus customs officer, he would say that the foreign currencies within the parcel are more than the Customs declaration duty and it?s better to pay the amount to get the currencies released.? ?
Threats?
They would also threaten these victims that if they attempt to visit the customs department the customs officers would prevent them saying that if they attempted to declare the currencies they may be arrested. They maintain that the foreign currencies were brought into the country illegally .The bogus officer also tells the victim to pay the customs declaration fee to the aforementioned local bank account and then the parcel with the foreign currencies could be released.? ?
After the customs declaration period expires several messages will be sent via the ?fake? Facebook account. Later the account will be deactivated or the profile would be changed, so that no one can trace them.? ?
Chandragupta said that there were no recorded complaints of anyone having made such payments after parcels were seized by the customs department.? ?He requested Facebook users to limit adding known friends and not to upload confidential or personnel details.

Changing the voting system and unfortunate realities
	
The Citizens? Movement for Good Governance (CIMOGG) refers to the article titled ?LET?S THROW OUT THE COMPLEX ?MIXED VOTING? SYSTEM FOR GOOD? by Bernard Fernando that appeared in the DAILY MIRROR on 7 December. ?Mixed voting? was, in fact, only one of the matters discussed by him in his contribution whereas he has made useful suggestions on other Constitution-related issues?as well.? ?
There are probably thousands of Sri Lankan citizens who have their own strong views on what particular provisions they would like to see included in the proposed new Constitution. Among them, Fernando has been particularly persistent in presenting to the public certain key features that he favours. Whilst CIMOGG does not concur with him unreservedly, it does support in principle a number of his recommendations that are similar to those that CIMOGG has advocated over many years. Stated in the briefest of terms, we believe the public should study the following list and press for the inclusion of these terms in the Constitution:? ?
1. Recognising the equality of all citizens bereft of considerations such as race, religion or caste. This would be the only permanently reliable way of encouraging every citizen to contribute to the realisation of an all-inclusive Sri Lankan identity that will eliminate much of the primitive emotions and wasted resources that racial, religious and similar conflicts involve.? ?
2. Introducing the ?Grama Rajya? or equivalent concept and de-politicising elections to the relevant peripheral assemblies by allowing good quality candidates to come forward without the sponsorship of political parties. Thus, they would gain the opportunity of earning for themselves a personal reputation for honesty, competence and hard work and not rely vicariously on the popularity of party leaders.? ?
3. Ensuring the administrative effectiveness of local bodies by assigning clearly specified functions to them and providing them with funding from the Centre without allocating any funds directly to MPs, who would tend to use such funds to promote their own private interests.? ?
4. Making party election manifestos legally binding to whatever extent may be practicable.? ?
5. Reducing the numbers of elected representatives drastically and specifiying clearly their duties and attendance requirements. For example, there is no use in having 225? ? MPs, as we do at present, and being told that only about eight of them had attended the recent meeting of the Constituent Assembly (of which all of them are mandatory members) to consider the report of the Steering Committee regarding the writing of a much-needed new Constitution. It would be infinitely more preferable, instead of having such a worthless bunch of irresponsible and unscrupulous layabouts, to elect a much smaller number of conscientious people?s representatives who are pre-qualified by a suitable selection process as persons possessing a good reputation for honesty and social responsibility, as well as a reasonable practical knowledge of the law, accountancy and other specialised areas of knowledge such as agriculture, exports, engineering, information technology etc.? ?
6. Requiring that the President should be non-executive and prohibiting his participation in party politics.? ?
These are just a very few of the important ingredients that should be included in a new Constitution. However, the unfortunate reality is that these and other progressive ideas have virtually no chance of being included in any Constitution that is required to be approved by a Parliament, such as the present, of which most members have not even passed the Ordinary Level examination and have not previously worked in reputable organisations that have a logical structure, strict administrative procedures and little room for dishonesty or blatantly immoral behaviour. Our MPs know that, if they agree to the making of a strong Constitution, over 90 per cent of them would have to say good-bye to their undeserved political careers soon thereafter. What then can the public do to remove this self-perpetuating obstacle to improving governance?? ?
One must try to take advantage of these brief periods of wakefulness because it is at these moments that voters become sufficiently active to make an effective impact by sending the right message through their votes
Ever since we gained independence, the progressively increasing ineptness and criminal dishonesty of too many of our elected representatives can be most readily traced to the deeply-entrenched passivity and inertia of Sri Lankan voters.
The only times that large numbers of citizens rouse themselves from their slumber is when election nominations are announced. One must try to take advantage of these brief periods of wakefulness because it is at these moments that voters become sufficiently active to make an effective impact by sending the right message through their votes.? ?
For a start, voters should be persuaded to forget about Mahinda Rajapaksa, Maithripala Sirisena, Ranil Wickremesinghe and those parties for which most voters have been blindly casting their votes in previous years. Instead, they should be urged to cast their votes during the forthcoming Local Government Elections for the most honest and competent of the candidates in their small electoral units irrespective of their political allegiances. If the public heeds this appeal, there would be a remarkable enrichment of the pool of able persons of integrity from which the candidates for election to Provincial Councils and Parliament could be nominated subsequently.? ?

EC at a loss to work out modalities at polling centres
	
The Election Commission is at a loss to work out modalities for providing security to vote counting at the polling stations at the local government polls, it is learnt.
The Commission had a meeting with the representatives of the political parties yesterday in this regard.
The present law, governing local government elections, provide for vote counting at polling centres. Commission?s Chairman Mahinda Desapriya is reported to have said that he is yet to determine how best security could be ensured.
The police officers who attended the meeting representing IGP Pujith Wijesundare also put forward their views. However, the final decision was not taken. It will be discussed further.
Also, the Commission decided that only ten persons would be allowed to do house-to-house canvassing of votes at a time for candidates in the fray.
Processions will also be banned this time. Cut-outs and posters can be displayed only within the premises where political meetings are conducted. (Kelum Bandara)

Fertilizer shortage: Govt. should compensate farmers - Wimal
	
The government should provide compensation to the farmers, who were affected following the prevailing shortage of fertilizer, leader of National Freedom Front (NFF), Wimal Weerawansa said today.
Addressing the media, he said the government should be held responsible for the prevailing fertilizer crisis and added instant actions should be sought to provide compensation to the farmers who were at a serious risk owing to the shortage.
?According to the information gathered, we noticed that the tenders had been issued in an illicit manner and thus importation of perilled fertilizer has been delayed. It is questionable as to why the government could not handle the tender procedure in a comprehensive manner without putting the innocent farmers into danger,? Weerawansa said.
He further said the government should do justice to the farmers who are entangled with the prevailing crisis and see that such a crisis would not occur in the long run again.
Meanwhile, he said they were pretty sure that the Pohottuwa would secure most number of seats followed by the victory at the upcoming Provincial Council Elections.??(Sheain Fernandopulle)

Macron urges Saudi king to lift Yemen blockade
	
?
PARIS AFP Dec27, 2017-French President Emmanuel Macron has urged Saudi Arabia?s King Salman to ?lift entirely the blockade? against Yemen so that humanitarian aid can be delivered to the food-deprived state.? ?
The comments came in a phone call between the two leaders on December 24, the French presidency said Wednesday.? ?
A Saudi-led military coalition has since 2015 been intervening in Yemen to support its internationally recognised government against Huthi rebels backed by Iran.? ?
Air strikes and a far-reaching blockade on Yemen?s air and sea ports have massively reduced the amount of food reaching the country, heavily critical international aid organisations say.? ?
In early November, the coalition tightened that blockade in response to a missile fired by the Shiite Huthis that was intercepted near Riyadh airport.? ?
Mark Lowcock, the UN undersecretary-general for humanitarian affairs, said that month unless the coalition ends a blockade of the country, Yemen will face ?the largest famine the world has seen for many decades, with millions of victims?.? ?
The blockade was partially lifted three weeks later under massive international pressure, namely over the closure of Hodeida port -- key to humanitarian and commercial deliveries.? ?
For France, there is ?no military solution to the conflict in Yemen? and it is ?essential that both sides return to the negotiating table?, Macron told Salman, the presidency added.? ?

Mechanism in place to bring back underworld figures from abroad
	
A mechanism has been put in place to arrest and bring back the underworld gang leaders who are operating from overseas, Law and Order Minister Sagala Ratnayake said.
He said the day when the drugs and the underworld would be wiped out from the country was not too far away.
?We are continuing to conduct raids and no one can stop that. No one can interfere our programme to eradicate and eliminate narcotics and underworld gangs from this country,? Minister said.
He said a total of 13.6 kilos of heroin which has a street value of over Rs. 135 million had been detected by the Special Task Force (STF) and the Drug and Organized Crimes Division during raids conducted this year.
The STF had recovered around 5.3 kilos of heroin valued of Rs. 53 million between the period of January to December 27 this year while the Drug and Organized Crimes Division which was established in August had recovered more than 8.2 kilos of heroin worth over Rs. 82 million.

DPA, 27th DECEMBER, 2017-More than 3.2 million people have applied since German unification nearly three decades ago for access to their personal files kept by the former feared communist East German secret police, the head of the Stasi records office told dpa.
?Some people only now dare to look back into the past and applied for access to the file when they became pensioners,? said Roland Jahn, who heads the Stasi Records Agency.
?There remains a fear about finding out whether they were spied on by neighbours or friends,? added Jahn, who was a human rights activist in the former communist East Germany.
While interest has been higher than initially expected, applications for copies of the security files are likely to wane over the longer term, said Jahn, who took up the post of head of the agency in 2011.?
About 46,300 people have applied for their files this year as of November, said Jahn, whose agency was set up following German unification in October 1990.

SL had supported CIA in several abductions: Gammanpila
	
The Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) yesterday said that Sri Lanka had allegedly supported the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) in several abductions.
PHU General Secretary MP Udaya Gammanpila told a news conference that these facts were revealed in a book written by former Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh?s daughter Attorney Amrith Singh.
MP Gammanpila said America was searching for a Russian computer hacker named Manokin Raufowich for stealing confidential information.
?He was produced in courts in Sri Lanka after been arrested during a holiday with his wife and daughter and was released on bail. Then he went missing. There were no immigration and emigration reports about his departure from Sri Lanka,? he added.
He said it was reported that he was taken to America by American Intelligence Unit with the support of the Sri Lankan government.
?According to the said book, CIA organization can abduct any person they wish while on holiday abroad. Then that person will be landed to an army camp by a private plane. There would be no clue that the wanted person has left the country,? he said.
He said however, this person was not taken to America but to a torture chamber in another country where there are less punishments. He also said that this book had included a list of countries which are supporting these kinds of acts where Sri Lanka was one of them.
?Page 109 of this book said that Sri Lankan government has supported these illegal abductions. This book reveals in August 2003, Sri Lanka has supported the CIA in abducting Riduwaan Isamudeen,? he added.
He said Prime Minster Ranil Wickremesinghe who was now in power was the Prime Minister at that time and added that it was a well known fact that he was biased towards America.
He said that it was a question whether the Russian hacker had met with the same fate as Riduwaan Isamudeen. He also said that it was the government's responsibility to reveal it. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)

The feasibility study for the proposed construction project on underground sea road extension via Marine Drive which would be connected to the Port City?s proposed elevated highway will be completed in March 2018, the Director of the Port City project Nihal Fernando said yesterday.
Speaking to the Daily Mirror he said that the Megapolis and Western Development Ministry had received the Cabinet approval to complete the project as Public ? Private Partnership (PPP) project.
He said that the Cabinet had submitted the proposal to the Cabinet Committee on Economic Management and the committee recommended that a joint venture would be more suitable for the above project.
The feasibility of the project will be looked by a three- member committee comprising Secretary of the Finance and Mass Media, Secretary of the Megpolis and Western Development and a representative of the Attorney General?s Department.
The agreements for the certain infrastructure to the Port City had signed between the Ministry of Megapolis and Western Development, Urban Development Authority and CHEC Port City Colombo (Pvt) Limited in August, 2016, he said.
?The Road Development Authority (RDA) will be constructed a new Kelani Bridge and Port Access Elevated Highway which would connect to the existing Colombo ? Katunayake Airport highway, and also an extension of Marine Drive will be also connected to the Port Access Elevated highway?, he said.
Mr. Feranado said that the Marine Drive sea road extension will increase the width of the Galle Face Green without damaging or disturbing the heritage buildings such as Galle Face Hotel and could also provide an underground road which would connect to the Shangri La Hotel area.(Yoshitha Perera)

DPA, 27th DECEMBER, 2017-The United States on Tuesday sanctioned two senior officials in North Korea?s unlawful weapons programmes in response to its ongoing development of ballistic missiles.
The US Treasury announced the sanctions in a statement, naming Kim Jong Sik and Ri Pyong Chol as their targets. The two men already were listed in a UN sanctions resolution passed on Friday aimed at further shutting down the impoverished communist country?s ability to raise illicit funds for its programmes.
?Treasury is targeting leaders of North Korea?s ballistic missile programmes, as part of our maximum pressure campaign to isolate [North Korea] and achieve a fully denuclearized Korean Peninsula,? said Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.
Kim Jong Sik reportedly is a key figure in North Korea?s ballistic missile development, including efforts to switch from liquid to solid fuel, and Ri Pyong Chol is reported to be a key official involved in North Korea?s intercontinental ballistic missile development, the Treasury Department statement said.
Under the new sanctions, any property or interests in property of the two men within US jurisdiction are blocked, and transactions by US persons involving the designated persons are generally prohibited, the statement said.
North Korea has continued developing its ballistic missile and nuclear weapons programmes in violation of UN Security Council Resolutions.

Won't hesitate to use sword: President
	
President Maithripala Sirisena said today he would not hesitate to use the ?sword? on his relatives, friends or party supporters in his journey to create a clean, unstained and a people-friendly political culture.
?In my journey with a sword to create a clean, unstained and a people-friendly political culture and to bring up a group of unblemished and untarnished politicians, I don?t care whether it is my relatives, friends or party supporters who get cut by my sword,? the president said quoting the Bhagavad Gita.
He said he wanted to create a rule in Sri Lanka similar to that of Lichchhavi dynasty that ruled the ancient kingdom of Nepal from 400 to 750 CE and Dharmashoka who ruled India from 269 BC from 'Pataliputta'.
Addressing a convention of leaders and representatives of 31 political parties under the theme ?Power of the country and village to Freedom? having pledged to support and contest on the UPFA ticket under the betel leaf symbol, the President said the vow taken at the opening of the convention by all political parties was the best stepping stone to launch the campaign to create a culture of clean politics and clean politicians in the country and eliminate corruption in politics for ever.
He said politicians must not have personal agendas but a national agenda to serve the people.
"The purifying of politics and giving power to honest politicians can be started from the party leaders? convention as there was a large number of youth who contest the LG polls from the UPFA. It is correct to say that an adult who has become a drunkard cannot be saved but a youth can be saved. In the similar manner, a youth who wishes to be a politicians must be taught not to report to thuggery, corruption or indecent acts for his political advantage. The vow taken today to that effect must be followed and protected by each and every politician who get elected to LG bodies at the forthcoming election," the President said. ?We as politicians hold various ideologies, policies and programmes. Do we have ever direct out attention as a to how and why many countries that were much behind to Sri Lanka a few decades ago have now become much powerful than Sri Lanka in terms of economic progress, military power, social empowerment and living standard of the people? Why is that? Sri Lanka is lagging behind in many aspects despite the fact that we are an education nation and we have engineers, doctors, IT experts, accountants and professionals in other disciplines. We have talents in abundance but no significant development in any field. Corruption, waste, mismanagement is omnipresent. These evils are the harvest of what have sowed by present day politics and politicians. That is why we need a vow from those who have decided to embrace politics as their profession that pledges that they would never ever engaged in misdeeds, use their office for their own advantage, engage in corruption and thuggery.?
The President said there was an era in the recent past where thugs, rapists, illegal sand miners and soil mudalalis ruled the roost with the state patronage and dictated to the police and the society.
He recalled that many political parties attempted to conduct LG polls under the old system but only the SLFP and the UPFA which held that the LG polls must be held under the new electoral system.
He appealed to all political party leaders to instruct their candidates to follow the pledge that would lead to the clean administration of local government bodies. The country today needs a clean political culture than a material progress.
Minister Nimal Siripala De Silva made the welcome address while Minister Mahinda Anmaraweera also addressed the gathering. (Sandun A Jayasekera)
