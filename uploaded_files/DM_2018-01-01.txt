A New Year of new hope, resolutions and expectations...
	
January 1st - the first day of the year is a day of traditional religious feast and an occasion for celebration. This time it is the dawn of the year two thousand and eighteen, the year during which all of us hope peace throughout the world and particularly harmony and economic prosperity in our motherland Sri Lanka.
January first came to be fixed as the first day of the year- New Year day in 158 B.C. Years were named and numbered after two Roman consuls. The date was chosen for military reasons. Throughout the middle ages a variety of Christmas feast days were used while the calendars often continued to display the months columns running from January to December in the Roman fashion and in most countries in the Western Europe January first was officially adopted as the New Year day even before they adopted the Gregorian calendar.
New Year in the universe
In the Eastern Orthodox churches, the New Year falls on January14, the first in the Julian calendar which has been adopted. Both in Gregorian and Julian New Year holidays are celebrated in most of the countries where Eastern Orthodox predominates. As such New Year is celebrated both as a civic holiday or the Gregorian day and as a religious holiday or the Julian day. 
God Janus with two faces
Romans derived the name for the month of January from their god Janus with two faces, one looking forward and the other backward. The practice of making resolutions to rid oneself from bad habits which were followed during the old year and to adopt better ones during the New Year. This practice is also dated to earliest times. This means that one should look back to realize the mistakes done during the year that is ended and to look forward to select better ones to be adopted during the New Year,
New Year in Sri Lanka
In Sri Lanka January first is regarded as the beginning of the New Year administratively. Sinhala and Tamil New Year falls on April 13 or14 with the transition of the Sun from Pisces to Aries. The New Year in Khmer, Thai, Laos and Burma falls due from 13 to 15 April and often concedes with the Sinhala and Hindu New Year.
The tournament of Rose parade in California dates back to 1886. In this parade the bowl of cut roses was carried. In that year members of the valleys hut club decorated their carriages with flowers. It resembles the ripping of the orange crop in that country. As part of the Rose bowl New Year foot ball game was played in 1902. In the following year it was followed by chariot races but the foot ball game returned in 1916 as the sports centrepiece of the festival. Many customs of the New Year festivals note the passing of the time with regrets for errors and mistakes during the old year and anticipation for luck and prosperity in the New Year.
Now New Year is celebrated in Sri Lanka
We in Sri Lanka prepare milk-rice and oil cakes for the New Year feast. New Year dawns with the sound of crackers mixed with music, blessings and greetings. Many people mark the New Year with religious observations. Buddhists offer Dana and puja to the monks and Hindus make oblations to the deities. Christians go to the church for The Year prayers and Muslims attend to religious rites in their mosques.

Every passing moment adds to our knowledge and experience and at the same time, each and every moment of the future will judge our capabilities to face new emerging challenges. The great commitment and determined courage shown by us to face those challenges and achieve those goals will take us to the level of excellence, he said.
We should bid farewell to the year that ends and welcome the New Year, with new expectations, and prioritize that vision.
Accordingly, as a country, we can consider the past year as a year in which many positive expectations have been fulfilled. Furthermore, we enter the year 2018 with many challenges that we must face with courage in order to accomplish our goals. The economic prosperity we should gain as a country, the reconciliation that should be deeply instilled in society, human freedom and the further endorsement of the glorious image of Sri Lanka at the international fora are among those priorities. Our determination and commitment towards making the New Year a successful one will depend on how far we succeed in achieving these goals.

## Title: CHALLENGES TO MEET

CHALLENGES TO MEET
	
Time flies by, the nights swiftly pass:
The stages of life successively desert us.
Seeing clearly this danger in death,
A seeker of peace should drop the worlds bait
- Gautama Buddha
We have commenced to step towards to complete another New Year, 2018. More than one and half decades of the new millennium swiftly expired. The dawn of the New Year brings numerous aspirations and inconceivable dreams in many hearts of the members in our human society. 
Multifarious projects, programmes and appointments are congregated in our schedules and agendas which anxiously remain and impatiently wait to be successfully executed and efficaciously carried out. 
While we concentrate on above mentioned facts, our paramount duties and responsibilities are there for us to be performed and fulfilled. 
Moment by moment, day by day numerous obstacles and impediments obstruct us to prevent the success and prosperity, we endeavour to achieve. Mostly undisciplined and vicious people enviously and ferociously design conflicts and set up barriers to stop our progress. They try the best of their abilities to extirpate anyones good reputation and brilliant character that they hardly shaped and earned. 
This is not a strange astonishment or wonder. It started from the genesis of the human race. The untrained and undisciplined human mind associates with many impure thoughts and underlying tendencies. Those people who entertain impurities and vicious thoughts commit unwholesome deeds as well as hurt and harm others. This is why conflicts are apparent in the globe today. 
Nano technology, consumerism and commercial culture are the persuasive forces that most people are infatuated with and entangled in. Most blindly believe that these tangible elements, materialistic commodities, commercial assets and other possessions could award happiness, but unfortunately some run into danger and catastrophic disaster. However it is not the supply of things to satisfy the needs of people that are bad, but the intention to exploit the consumer for vicious purposes. 
Social, political and psychological problems are never-ending. They are rapidly increasing in our global society. Unfortunately many parts in the globe indulge in these acts in the worst manner. 
Compassion, kindness, tolerance and many other paramount teachings of the Buddha are just only for lip service. Hatred based political atmosphere is clearly visible. Unlimited executive power and those who entertain it in the periphery are preposterous and delirious. They never think about the thoughts they implant, acts commit, deeds they perform and ultimately the outcome they inherit as a repercussion is perilous and dangerous. Such behaviours lead to disasters but not to salvation 
Not only our Buddhist canon and legends but also few centuries back history have brilliantly proved and clearly affirmed how powerful leaders met and faced the consequences of their own brutal and arrogant acts which they senselessly and atrociously committed with their limitless power. 
Nano technology, consumerism and commercial culture are the persuasive forces that most people are infatuated with and entangled in. Most blindly believe that these tangible elements, materialistic commodities, commercial assets etc., could award happiness, but unfortunately some run into danger and catastrophic disaster
For example, life of Alexander the Great, the Greek King taught a great lesson to mankind, that everyone must take into consideration. At the age of 20 he became a king. As a military commander, he was undefeated and the most successful throughout history. On his way home from conquering many countries, he came down with an illness. At that moment, his captured territories, powerful army, sharp swords, and wealth all had no meaning to him. He realised that death would soon arrive and he would be unable to return to his homeland. He told his officers: I will soon leave this world. I have three final wishes. You need to carry out what I tell you. His generals, in tears, agreed. 
My first wish is to have my physician bring my coffin home alone.
After a gasping for air, Alexander continued: My second wish is scatter the gold, silver, and gems from my treasure-house along the path to the tomb when you ship my coffin to the grave. After wrapping in a woollen blanket and resting for a while, he said: My final wish is to put my hands outside the coffin. The people surrounding him all were very curious, but no one dared to ask the reason. Alexanders most favoured General kissed his hand and asked: My Majesty, we will follow your instruction. But can you tell us to why you want us to do it this way
After taking a deep breath, Alexander said: I want everyone to understand the three lessons I have learned. To let my physician carry my coffin alone is to let people realize that a physician cannot really cure peoples illness. Especially when they face death, the physicians are powerless. I hope people will learn to treasure their lives.
My second wish is to tell people not to be like me in pursuing wealth. I spent my whole life pursuing wealth, but I was wasting my time most of the time. My third wish to let people understand that I came to this world with empty hands and I will leave this world also with empty hands.
He closed his eyes after finished talking and stopped breathing. 
25 centuries ago, the Great Master, Gauthama Buddha has profoundly emphasised the perfect and true way to pursue and achieve happiness. It is called the Middle Path  Noble Eightfold Path. 
Most Buddhist scholars have specifically inscribed the Noble Eightfold Path as the Buddhas Ancient Path. Most global scholars have descriptively elaborated as a theoretical recitation and academic aphorism. 
It is important to be aware and understand that these eight factors which contain in Noble Eightfold Path are applicable in ones daily life and they are very pragmatic. The most vital fact is the interest to practise with effort and determination. These eight factors definitely direct and open the gateway to achieve innermost peace and happiness, if one mindfully and genuinely put into practice in ones daily life. 
No one can promise you or no one is mighty to proffer you true happiness and inner peace here and hereafter unless you accomplish with your own effort and perseverance. Even though everyone hardly seeks and arduously pursues happiness through various avenues, unfortunately most of them are not really in the state of happiness and are despondent of their own lives. When one closely studies and impartially scrutinizes the prime cause and the main reason is the lack of contentment and impatience. These two major elements are the driving forces which are based on craving, hatred and ignorance that everyone is lead to unhappiness and suffering. 
Lifestyle and spiritual progress are pivotal components and key facts in human life. If no one concentrates on these two central issues properly, life would be miserable and destructive along with mental agonies and preclude the journey of happy life. The eight vicissitudes of life or Eight Worldly conditions are the common and familiar factors that everyone, even enlightened beings, meets and experiences. The Buddha Dhamma has profoundly contributed and impeccably guided us to meet and overcome these both negative and positive challenges in our day to day life with unshaken mind. 
Gain and loss, fame and disrepute, praise and blame, pleasure and pain are the Eight Worldly conditions. The Dhamma shows how the ordinary and the noble disciple differ in their responses to these changes. While the ordinary is elated by success in achieving gain, fame, prise and pleasure, and dejected when confronted with their undesired opposites, the noble disciple remains unperturbed. By applying the understanding of impermanence to both favourable and unfavourable conditions, the noble disciple can abide in equanimity, not attached to favourable conditions, not repelled by unfavourable ones. Such a disciple gives up likes and dislikes, sorrow and distress, and ultimately succeeds the highest blessing of all  complete freedom from suffering. 
As a lay follower of the Blessed One, Anathapindika, the Buddhas chief patron received a remarkable discourse from the Master. It contains four kinds of happiness and how to achieve them, namely: the happiness of possessions, the happiness of enjoyment, the happiness of freedom from debt, and the happiness of blamelessness. These four kinds of happiness will create a peaceful inner environment to lead noble and spiritual life. 
Most people try their utmost to compete with others, accumulate and multiply their material possessions along with fanatic class, status and prominence. Unfortunately they always dwell in two worlds such as the past and the future. They never stay in the present moment. 
They blindly presume and excessively dream to be happy and ecstatic after the completion of their own accumulation. But foremost admonition in this essay reveals the true nature of the life. 
Once the famous poet, Thomas Grey has spelled out in his poem thus: 
The boast of heraldry, the pomp of power,
And all that beauty, all that wealth ever gave,
Awaits alike the inevitable hour:
The paths of glory lead but to the grave.
The Gautama Buddha impeccably and profoundly emphasised value and power of the present moment. The practice of mindfulness through meditation guides us to be aware of the present moment. If someone is mindfully aware of the present moment, one will understand the key secret of happiness. This is the greatest challenge we meet and somehow overcome to achieve ultimate peace and innermost happiness. 
There is no specific time or certain age to contemplate on the spiritual life. Life is uncertain and death is certain. Physical health is vulnerable. No one can be sure of a healthy life which is permanent. Many people go through various mental agonies and psychological traumas along with their physical ailments. It is very important to understand that getting old, becoming sick, deteriorating physical strength, finally embracing an inevitable death. We have no time to delay or hold the breath till we complete or finish our mundane tasks and projects. When the time is right, we must get ready to depart from this world. No one is there to take that responsibility. All around you are powerless and speechless. Good and bad  wholesome and unwholesome you do, will follow as a never departing shadow. One is responsible for oneself. 
Mind power, mental culture, purification of the mind, inner peace and innermost happiness are the soothing assets that one can achieve to console oneself at the final moment when one departs. 
When we carefully reflect upon and recall on the year or decade we expired and concluded, we are able detect and discover both the failures and accomplishments. Not only materialistic life but also we should think about our spiritual life. Leading a spiritual life is harder and strenuous than ordinary life because those who practise and cultivate inner qualities, such as kindness, tolerance, equanimity, generosity, should inwardly discipline themselves. The person who does not tread the spiritual path ultimately would be very remorseful and regrettable about his or her failures. With introspection of oneself, one is able to renounce the acts which bring failures and continuously maintain the performance that contribute to accomplishments. 
The Noble eightfold Path is the only and the exact path to achieve the true innermost happiness. 
These are the challenges that one should think of in the wake of the New Year. 
May you have a peaceful New Year!

## Title: Duruthu Poya and the Concept of Merit Transfer

Duruthu Poya and the Concept of Merit Transfer
	
Duruthu Poya celebrates Buddhas significant first visit to Sri Lanka two thousand five hundred years ago and nine months after his Enlightenment: it marks the countrys commencement of teachings of Buddhism. 
When the full moon radiates its light over the land of Sri Lanka, followers of the Buddhist teachings engage in meditation and meritorious deeds. Duruthu is the first full moon Poya of the year, in the month of January. This year there are two full moon poya days in the month of January this year, the second known as Adhi Duruthu falls on 31st. 
Mahavamsa, the ancient chronicle records the splendid saga which took place of nine months after Buddhas Enlightenment was to restore peace and dispel war and violence, his visit to Mahiyangana had a noble purpose. It was to free the land from the evil doing Yakkhas. Hostility with the two main tribes the Yakkhas and Nagas who were in constant confrontation. The Enlightened One arrived at the Mahanaga Grove Mahiyangana on a Duruthu Full Moon Poya day. 
Buddha stood before the congregation of Yakkhas radiating an aura of rainbow-hued rays from his body. The Yakkhas were conquered. Then the Buddha preached the message of non-violent coexistence to those who assembled to hear his words. Sumana Saman was one of them who attained Sovan, the first of the four stages leading to Nirvana. A few locks of Buddhas hair (Kesa Dhathu) were deposited in a casket which Sumana enshrined in a small dagoba built at the site where all this transpired; it is now known as the Mahiyangana Raja Maha Vihara. This is countrys first stupa. The collar bone relic or Greeva Dhathu, which was recovered from the funeral pyre of the Buddha too was brought to the island by Arahant Sarabha Thera. It was enshrined in the dagoba reconstructed by The Prince Uddachulabhaya, brother of King Devanampiyatissa at Mahiyangana Maha Vihara. 
However, the focus of Duruthu is centred round Kelaniya, where the annual Duruthu Perahera is conducted by the Raja Maha Viharaya which stands on a small mount just by the Southern Bank of Kelani river. 
When the full moon radiates its light over the land of Sri Lanka, followers of the Buddhist teachings engage in meditation and meritorious deeds. Duruthu is the first full moon Poya of the year, in the month of January
Merit Transferin Milindapanha
The King Milinda in Milindapanha conveys the idea that if the beneficiary is not mindful of a gift of merit being offered, the giver gets no advantage thereby. Naagasena quotes a few examples to prove that is wrong. The disparity is that the act of transfer is an act of unselfishness and the feedback of the action on oneself has a purification effect, as well as on the person to whom the act is aimed at. Naagasena says, Milinda, If a person transfers merit, that merit expands and grows more and more, during the process of transferring it, and the merit of that presentation he is able toshare out it to whomsoever he will.
Buddha says that in a society exploited by differences and disagreements, a person called Mahasammata chosen from among them should maintain and preserve peace through laws of virtue. He should stick to standards of transparency, authority, and accountability. In Maha Sudassana and the Chakkavatti Sihanada Suttas Buddha detailed this when he talk about the Dhasaraja Dhamma.
Acts of merit bring Joy and happiness to the doer in this world and in the next. 
As a stream must flow and reach and fill the far-away main,
what is given here will reach and consecrate the spirits.
Water poured on mountain top would soon tumble down and fill the plain
like what is given here will get to and bless the feelings there.
- Nidhikanda Sutra
Punna in Pali is a notion in Buddhism and Hinduism. As a result of good deeds Merit is accumulated and carries over through the life and the subsequent births. There are a number of ways in which merit can be gained. The Sutra suggests ten different ways in which it can occur. According to The Great Vows of Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva Sutta of Mahayana one can transfer one-seventh of the merit of an act to a loved one who is no more, to lessen the deceases misery in their new lives. 
Mahyana or Theravada Concept
Some Western scholars of Buddhism, thought that the transfer of merit was a Mahayana concept developed at a late era and that it was rather harsh with Buddhist perceptions of karma hypothesis. Heinz Bechert, believes the doctrine in its developed form to a period between the 5th and 7th centuries. However, Anthony Barber differs in his viewsmerit transfer was an essential part of Buddhism practised from Buddhas times. Buddhism teaches that the accrued merit can be transferred, can be shared with others; it is reversible and the persons who receive can be either living or dead. 
The method of transfer is quite simple; the doer has only to wish that the merit he has gained accumulate to an important person in particular, or to all beings, a desire purely mental or expressed by words. All actions, according to the Buddha, what really matters is thought. Transference is mainly an act of the mind. Tirokuddha Sutta  Khuddakanipatha says, there is no use in lamenting, weeping, feeling sorry and bewailing; such approaches are of no effect to the departed ones. Some simply waste on hollow rituals and performances in commemoration of departed ones. They do not realize that it is not possible to assist the dead simply by constructing graveyards, Monuments, tombs, and other paraphernalia; instead performing some meritorious acts like building temples, orphanages, schools, libraries, hospitals, or distributing Dhamma books and other many related charitable activities. 
MAY ALL BEINGS BE HAPPY!

The Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) said today it would request the Presidential Secretariat for a copy of the PCoI report on the Central Bank bond scam under the Right to Information Act (RTI).
JVP Leader Anura Kumara Dissanyake told a news conference that the report was not only for the President but also meant for the people to know who was responsible for the bond scam.
The report was handed over to the President on December 30. It is his responsibility to present it to the people because they have a right to know how so much of public funds had been misappropriated and about those involved," he said.
Mr. Dissanayake said the President was duty bound to implement the recommendations proposed by the (PCoI) and take action against the culprits by forwarding the report to the Attorney General.
Don't allow this report to be swept under the carpet like what happened to the reports of the Presidential Commissions in the past. The tradition has been to suppress one report by using another report or suppress a fraud by another fraud. Don't let that happen to this report as well, he said.
Mr. Dissanayake said the Presidential Commission of Inquiry to Investigate and Inquire into Serious Acts of Fraud, Corruption and Abuse of Power, State Resources and Privileges (PRECIFAC) had submitted 17 reports to the President but no action had been taken on what the reports disclose.
We fear this happening to this report as well. We also hope to obtain the copies of the reports submitted by PRECIFAC to the President, he said. (Ajith Siriwardana)

The EC has already banned such activities by politicians during the campaign period because it will give undue political mileage at the elections.
However, government officials can carry out such work in a manner that will not boost any candidate or party in the fray.
The EC is continuing to receive complaints about such activities in the run up to the election.

Nuclear button is on my desk: Kim Jong-un
	
North Korea's leader Kim Jong-un has said he has a nuclear launch button on his desk at all times so the US "will never be able to start a war".
In a televised new year speech, he said the entire US was within range of North Korean nuclear weapons, adding: "This is reality, not a threat."
But he also offered a potential olive branch to South Korea, suggesting he was "open to dialogue" .
North Korea may also send a team to the Winter Olympics in Seoul, he said.
When asked by reporters to respond to Mr Kim's threats, US President Donald Trump said, "we'll see, we'll see".
He was speaking at the sidelines of New Year's Eve celebrations at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida.
North Korea has come under increased sanctions over the past year because of its nuclear weapons programme and repeated testing of conventional missiles.
The politically isolated state has carried out six underground nuclear tests and has demonstrated missiles of increasing power.
In November, it tested the Hwasong-15, which achieved altitudes of around 4,475km (2,780 miles) - more than 10 times the height of the International Space Station. (BBC)

PM extends wishes for 2018, says restored economic stability
	
Extending wishes for the New Year, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said the government was able to steer forward in restoring economic stability and a process of sustainable development amidst great challenges.
When we established the Government of Good Governance, the country was facing a time of social, economic and political decline, he said.
The Premier said 2018 dawns on us as we recall the victory won in restoring political and social values, in realising a dream long cherished by the people of this country.
It reminds us that we still have a task ahead - that of consolidating the true meaning of that victory. We have been successful in presenting Sri Lanka to the world as a country that respects and recognises human dignity, one in which all have access to social and political freedom. 
A country that abides by the principles of good governance. In the process, we have been able to generate a greater sense of goodwill among the international community towards Sri Lanka.
We take this opportunity to thank everyone who accompanied us on the journey of emerging as a country with the highest regard for the principles of democracy and ethics.
It is my most sincere hope that you would continue to be with us as we go forward. May 2018 be a year of hope and courage for all, he said.

Police remove MR cutouts at A'pura
	
The police have removed the cutouts and posters bearing the image of former president Mahinda Rajapaksa from a Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) office in Medawachchiya on the basis that it was unlawful to keep such items with the image of someone not belonging to the party.
SLPP Medawachchiya organizer K.H. Nandasena has lodged a complaint to the Elections Commissioner about this incident.
"Police personnel came to the office on Sunday and forcibly took away leaflets with Mr. Rajapaksas pictures saying it is unlawful to keep them. When we informed the Anuradhapura SP he said the action taken by the Police was correct. They said there was nothing wrong in having the pictures of party leader G.L.Peiris, the electoral organize and the candidate but it was illegal to use the picture of Mr. Rajapaksa who is not a member of the SLPP," Mr. Nandasena said.
He said the Anuradhapura Assistant Commissioner of elections when contacted said no such instructions had been given and asked the police not take such action until instructions were received.
SLPP district leader S.M.Chandrasena said any person can keep pictures of Mr. Rajapaksa who liberated the country from the terrorists and that his pictures could be used for the election if he wished.
Anuradhapura district MP Shehan Semasinghe said the government had got scared of Mr. Rajapaks's pictures. He said Mr. Rajapaksa had informed the Elections Commissioner that he had no objections about his pictures being used by the SLPP for the election campaign. (Dayaratna Embogama)

Political parties 'discriminate' own female-candidates: CaFFE
	
Female candidates contesting the upcoming Local Government (LG) election are seen subjected to maltreatment by their own political parties, the election watchdog- Campaign for Free and Fair Elections (CaFFE) said today.
CaFFE Executive Director Rajith Keerthi Tennakoon commented on a growing development where female candidates were being neglected and not receiving the same attention given to their male counterparts by their respective political parties.
Political parties tend to ignore the female candidates in their wards. This prejudice is bound to boomerang on the final result of the polls of any political party. The Election Commission will make sure that 25 percent of female representation is made from the total number of seats secured by a political party at a given LG body. Therefore, it is vital to pay attention to all candidates irrespective of their gender, he said.
He said issues could arise when the female candidates, who did not receive the backing from the party, were elected to a LG body. They may not support the partys decision- making in the LG bodies, he said.
He said certain candidates continued to intimidate candidates of the same party with the impression that this was a preferential votes-based election. (Lahiru Pothmulla)
