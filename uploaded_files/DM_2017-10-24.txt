A Blue-Green Era in Sri Lanka
	
Major challenges faced by the world today are the rise of global warming and climate changes which have a drastic impact on the activities of the people. As it has been estimated that the world population would increase by another 2 billion by the year 2050, it has become absolutely essential to control a further rise of world warming due to activities of this increased population. At the same time, climate changes are long-term changes in the earths climate, especially a change due to an increase in the average atmospheric temperature. Thus, it is incumbent on the present generation to employ appropriate measures to utilize limited natural resources of the world for a sustainable production process and consumption of future generations.


A Senior Technical Advisor of the Ministry of Environment, Prof. W.L. Sumathipala said that the main reason for the rise of global warming is greenhouse effect which warms the Earths surface.
When the Suns energy reaches the Earths atmosphere, some of them reflect back to space and the rest is absorbed and re-radiated by greenhouse gases. Greenhouse gases include water vapour, Carbon Dioxide (CO2), Methane, Nitrous Oxide, Ozone and some artificial chemicals such as Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs). The human activities, like burning fossil fuels (coal, oil and natural gas), agriculture and land clearing are increasing the concentrations of greenhouse gases. This is the enhanced greenhouse effect, which is contributing to warming of the Earth, Prof. Sumathipala said.
Thus, it is mostly applicable and opportune to adopt a blue-green development strategy for the sustainable development of Sri Lanka in order to provide a more fruitful, happy and healthy livelihood for the public. Sri Lanka is facing an abnormal situation due to climate changes.
Director of Climate Change in the Ministry of Mahaweli Development and Environment, Sunimal Jayathunga said that the United Nations Conference on Climate Changes, (21 Session of Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change - COP 21) was held in Paris from November 30 to December 11, 2015.
As Sri Lanka is a signatory to these resolutions, we have to adopt all appropriate measures to curb the rise of global warming. Sri Lanka is a developing Island Nation which is highly vulnerable to adverse effect of climate change that affect all social, economical and development activities. It is noteworthy that productive steps needed to be taken in order to control climate changes, he said.
Mr. Jayathunga said that an event called SRI LANKA NEXT - A Blue Green Era Conference and Exhibition would be held from October 16 to October 17 at BMICH under the aegis of the president Maithripala Sirisena and organized by Ministry of Mahaweli Development and Environment in line with the worlds interest on controlling climate changes .
The event also aims at gathering updated knowledge on local, regional and global efforts to address the issues on climate change and disseminate such knowledge to support the development agenda of Sri Lanka.
This blue-green development strategy could lead us in the following directions.



Blue Development
Geographically, Sri Lanka is positioned at a vantage point consisting marine resources in an extent of 532,619 sq km which is proposed to be extended up to 1,714, 687 sq.km, and an attractive and resourceful sea coast of 1 600 km. It is necessary to identify the sustainable development strategies to manage these marine resources without causing environmental pollution. Some development opportunities could be listed as follows:
Possibilities should be explored to research medicinal value of oceanic resources and developed to produce medicines for humans utilizing oceanic resources.

1 Oceanic Fish Resources: Efforts should be made to utilize these resources employing sustainable strategies.
2 Other Marine Biological Resources: Sri Lankas marine region consists of valuable resources including corals and other marine life arid priority should be given to maximize the use of these resources.
3 Oceanic Mineral Resources: Sri Lankas coast line, the ocean floor contains valuable mineral resources which can be converted to value added products for commercial purposes. Possibilities in this respect need to be explored.
4 Oceanic Navigation and Port Facilities: Economic prosperity could be achieved by developing oceanic navigation sea voyages and natural and modern sea ports in an Eco-friendly manner.
5Development of Tourism Industry Utilizing Coastal and Oceanic Resources: Encouragement of the development of tourism industry using sustainable and eco-friendly means should be considered in promoting Sri Lankan beaches rich in attractions and good climatic conditions and the oceanic floor with valuable resources.


Green Development:
Additional Executive of Environment Planning and Economics, Anuruddha Tennakoon said that the forests cover at present in Sri Lanka is 29.7% which had affected the rise of global warming in Sri Lanka.
One of the key grounds for the global warming is insufficient forest cover in a particular region. As Sri Lanka is embroiled with climate changes and global warming, we have to address this issue quite positively in giving priority to regain the lost forest coverage. Therefore, we have planned to distribute 200,000 plants in this month of planting under the theme Vana Ropa, Mr. Tennakoon said.
He said that the plants especially indigenous plants are available in the Department of Forest Conservation until the end of the month of October and added if anybody wished to join us are mostly welcome. 
It should be the fervent hope of all of us as Sri Lankans to concentrate on all aforementioned areas and effectively utilize all available strategies of Blue-Green Development social and economic development for future of Sri Lanka. In doing so, attempts should be made to reduce emission of Green House Gases (GHG), polluted water as well as other pollutants that pollutes the environment. These will afford us sustainable development which in turn will make a happy and prosperous future generation, for which the world will respect Sri Lanka; the beautiful paradise.

1 Green Industrial Production: All Industrial productions should be made according to Eco-friendly standards for sustainability which in turn will provide economic benefits while protecting the environment.
2 Green Agriculture: Sustainability should be ensured by utilizing Eco-friendly means for the development of agriculture.
3 Green Energy: Utilization of environment friendly tools has to be encouraged for the production of green energy for the social and economic development of Sri Lanka.
4 Green Cities/Villages: Developers should be encouraged to utilize environment friendly standards for the construction of green cities and villages.

Access to Yala: safari jeeps limited to 200 per day
	
The safari jeep operators at the Yala National Park carried out a protest campaign yesterday morning demanding unhindered access to the wildlife sanctuary, which is one of the countrys top most tourist attractions.
The safari jeep operators at the Yala National Park carried out a protest campaign yesterday morning demanding unhindered access to the wildlife sanctuary, which is one of the countrys top most tourist attractions.
The Yala National Park was opened for the public yesterday after a two-month closure.
The opening saw the introduction of a new rule, which restricted the number of safari jeeps accessing the park to 200 a day100 jeeps in the morning and another 100 in the afternoon.
This was introduced after consultation with the Wildlife and Tourism authorities as Yala was being overcrowded.
Safari jeep operators claim that tourism will suffer due to the new regulation. But the countrys tourism authorities are of the view that the move would in fact help tourism in the long-run and also protect the fauna and flora at the national park.
They said the new regulation is aimed at ensuring discipline, order and sustainability at the Yala National Park.
While the move is commendable, the tourism authorities are yet to carry out a proper study into the recreational carrying capacity of Yala National Park and take necessary regulatory actions to preserve this invaluable national resource for the future generation.
Over a half a million tourists visited Yala National Park in 2015.
There were numerous incidents recorded at many occasions of unrestrained safari jeeps playing mayhem in the Yala National Park as jeep drivers follow their own jungle law within the sanctuary.

Bahrain temporarily frees female activist: rights groups
	

Bahrain has temporarily freed a female activist who has accused her government of torture in detention, rights groups said Monday. 
Ebtisam al-Saegh was released late Sunday as she awaits her trial on terrorism charges, the Bahrain Institute for Human Rights said. 
Two other activists, Radhi al-Qatari and Mohammed al-Shakhoori, were also released pending their trials on similar charges, it said. 
London-based rights group Amnesty International re-tweeted a post announcing Saeghs release. 
Bahrains justice ministry did not respond to a request
for comment. 
Saegh was detained in July after re-tweeting a series of posts critical of Bahrains king and its security agency and charged later the same month with terrorism. 
Her detention prompted warnings from rights groups she was at risk of torture. Saegh accused Bahraini security services of torture and sexual assault during a previous arrest in May.

Envy breeds malice
	
A fair white collar one who had ably served as an interpreter to a high political authority during the latters official visit abroad is said to be getting shabby treatment from her divisional head ever since that occasion.

The divisional head sulking over the loss of opportunity to accompany the high political authority on the foreign visit had begun harassing the fair white collar one in every way possible out of sheer spite, they say.
This worthy after missing the foreign trip, had informed the authorities concerned both verbally and in writing that he was better qualified to function as the political bigwigs interpreter at official functions, but has failed to receive a positive response so far, they say.
This spiteful high-up was under interdiction on a charge of an attempted sexual assault on a female subordinate and was reinstated quite recently, they say.

Ex-cadres seek acceptance to mend shattered lives
	
Rehabilitated LTTE supporters in Kilinochchi reveal how they are still struggling to establish a livelihood

Eight years after the 30-year ethnic conflict, Sri Lanka is now treading a path to reconciliation. While various attempts have been made to establish physical offices to serve justice to those affected, they still seem to be in limbo. Rehabilitation programmes took centre stage when the war concluded, but to what extent they have been successful still remains a question. Upon completion of their rehabilitation courses, ex-LTTE supporters have been released back into society to start a life on their own. But the support extended by the Government is rather questionable once again. Although reconciliation cant be achieved overnight, eight years would have been sufficient enough to change their lives for the better.
While on a recent visit to Kilinochchi, the learned that many of the rehabilitated LTTE supporters in Kilionchchi are still unemployed. With the assistance of Corporal Chandraratne and Sergeant Girihagama, two officers serving the Sri Lanka Air Force, the walked into some of the houses where these rehabilitated people dwell to speak to them. 

People still dont like to speak with us
- Sathgunasingham Dayabaran
Sathgunasingham Dayabaran, a father of five, resides in Kilinochchi. He has been a strong supporter of the cause who later surrendered to the Army. We had many workshops and were given extensive training in various aspects. I was in a rehabilitation camp for one year and returned home earlier this year. Now I undertake contracts to do road construction work. I earn a healthy income as well. But still theres a stigma in society and people still dont like to speak to us. I hope their mentality will change as we move on,said Dayabaran.
I was in a rehabilitation camp for one year and returned home earlier this year. Now I undertake contracts to do road construction


It took a long time for us to return to normalcy
-Nadarajah Vijayakumar
After meeting Dayabaran, we then met another ex-cadre, Nadarajah Vijayakumar. He is a father of four and works as a three-wheeler driver. I supported the LTTE in the front defence line for three years and after the war I was at the Boossa rehabilitation camp. There we had various skills development programmes and I learned to do masonry and other work. When the programme concluded we were presented with certificates. But as a mason I cant earn a lot of money to feed my family and thereafter I bought a three-wheeler. Sadly theres a heavy stigma revolving around our lives. But people are slowly getting used to our presence in society. It took a long time for us to return to normalcy. We still face issues when obtaining bank loans because banks have come up with a policy to refrain from issuing loans to ex-LTTE supporters. Therefore we would like to request the Rehabilitation Authority to look into our matters. Now that the war has concluded, all of us should now enjoy and retain the peace and everybody should contribute towards it.
There we had various skills development programmes and I learned to do masonry and other work
Many ex-supporters who are unemployed
-Singalavel Satheeskumar
The LTTE forcibly took me away, recalled Singalavel Satheeskumar. I worked in the medical section because I have done a MBBS course. I learned medicine and worked in Government offices as well. During the war I had to take care of casualties and treat them. There werent many qualified people in the cause and because of that they took me in. I surrendered in 2009 and was sent to the Welikanda Rehabilitation Camp. We were provided with training according to our capabilities and therefore I received training in IT. I was released in 2011 and joined the Civil Security Division and also worked at the National Transport Medicine Authority. The Government provided coconut plants to rehabilitated supporters and also provided them with job opportunities. But today there are many ex-supporters who are unemployed.Those who havent had any education dont have professional qualifications. These people ask for Government jobs and they end up with none since qualifications come first,he said. 

I surrendered in 2009 and was sent to the Welikanda Rehabilitation Camp
I still dont have a permanent job
-K. Dayabaran
TheDailymirror also spoke to K. Dayabaran whos a father of three. The Army took me away because they suspected that I was a LTTE supporter. I was then taken to Boossa and spent one year at the rehabilitation camp there. We were provided with some training, but I ended up doing coolie work. I still dont have a permanent job and because of that I dont have a proper income. My younger daughter cant talk and her medicine is quite expensive. I sometimes have to take her to Colombo and that too is a challenge for me. Therefore its difficult to raise a family by earning Rs. 1000-2000 per day. I in fact need at least Rs. 30,000 a month, but that is still a dream. I would like to work somewhere and earn more, but sadly there are limited opportunities, he said.

its difficult to raise a family by earning Rs. 1000-2000 per day
Programmes are needed to relink them with society
- R. Sampanthan
Speaking to the Dailymirror, Opposition Leader R. Sampanthan said that no constructive steps have been taken to provide these persons with employment. I dont think the issue of their future has been addressed. There should be programmes to relink them with society, both for their own benefit and in order to stabilise the society. Therefore, as far as Im concerned, a serious programme has to be implemented,said Sampanthan. 
I dont think the issue of their future has been addressed
Many programmes have beenimplemented thus far
- Ministry of Prison Reforms, Rehabilitation,Resettlement and Hindu Religious Affairs
TheDailymirror also spoke to the Ministry of Prison Reforms, Rehabilitation, Resettlement and Hindu Religious Affairs to inquire about the programmes that have been conducted so far. Speaking to us, Media Secretary Dumidu Bandara confirmed that many projects had been conducted in order to uplift their livelihoods. We have provided over 125 families with a sum of Rs. one lakh to start their businesses and to be used for other expenses. For instance, goats and other machines were provided as encouragement so that they can start their own businesses. In 2016, 11253 houses were provided to people in the North Eastern province. In addition to that we have constructed 41 pre-schools, 29 schools, 23 hospitals/ healthcare centres and provided electricity to over 100 homes and water facilities to over 3000 houses,said Bandara. 
Speaking further Bandara said that they have to ensure the transparency during these transactions. While some of these projects are directly conducted by the Ministry, the Divisional Secretariat is involved with others. We also have to make sure that they have been actually affected by the war. They cant say that nothing has been done because the Ministry has implemented a system and is also planning many projects for the well-being of these people, added Bandara. 
We have provided over 125 families with a sum of Rs. one lakh to start their businesses and to be used for other expenses

Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is common with those who have served in the battle field. Its a disorder that develops in people who have experienced a shocking, scary or dangerous event.
Symptoms could either be acute or chronic. The stigma that revolves around the war has dimmed the hopes of these people when it comes to linking with society. As mentioned by some of the ex-supporters, they still experience difficulties in communicating with the rest of the people in their town.
Best approach is to join groups and try to link with the society
- Dr. Mahesh Rajasuriya
The Dailymirroralso spoke to Consultant Psychiatrist Dr. Mahesh Rajasuriya who said that reintegration depends on the harmony between ex-LTTE cadres and the community. They need to return to their villages and connect with their relations and neighbours. The community should think that they are remnants of the war and its useless to take them seriously. Someone has to study the psyche of the community and why they dont want to accept them back. In this situation, reintegration will be entirely different. Therefore as a society we have to study how the Tamil community in Kilinochchi view this problem. The best approach is to join groups and try to link with the society. If they stay at home theyll never be able to connect with the community and we also have to do research on how they look at us,said Dr. Rajasuriya.

Ex-cricket umpire Darrell Hair guilty of theft
	
Former umpire Darrell Hair, best known for calling legendary Sri Lankan spinner Muttiah Muralitharan for throwing during a 1995 Boxing Day Test  stole more than $9000 from a bottle shop he was working at in Orange, in central west New South Wales.
The theft occurred from February and April this year and was discovered when CCTV footage caught him taking money from the till and placing it in his pocket.
Magistrate Michael Allen said the charges marked a monumental fall from grace for Hair  who officiated in 78 Test matches and 139 one-day internationals.
Hair blamed a gaming addiction for the theft but admitted his responsibility, repaid the money and wrote letters of apology, the magistrate said.
Allen also said Hair was seeking counselling for depression and addiction.
Hairs solicitor, Andrew Rolfe, dubbed the theft as an aberration.
My client has been in the public eye for many years and this is a bit of a fall for him, to find himself before the court in these circumstances, Rolfe said.
This is an aberration in the life of a man who, prior to this, had a lifetime of service to the community and to a sport that he loved.
A fact sheet tendered to court added that Hair, stated that he had no excuse for his dishonesty and he had let his gambling get too far out of control during the early months of 2017 and failed to react to the signs that it was out of control.
Hair was sentenced to a 18-month good behaviour bond but a conviction was not recorded.
Hair, who also umpired domestic cricket in Australia, was a promising young cricketer in his own right, playing grade cricket in Sydney.
But a knee injury prematurely ended his career and saw him take up umpiring.
He also officiated in Test crickets first ever forfeit, when Pakistan decided to stop playing in a 2006 Test against England at The Oval.
Hair and fellow umpire Billy Doctrove gave Pakistan a five-run penalty for ball tampering and, after a delay, the incensed Pakistanis refused to go back on the field. (The New Daily)

FM trying to reduce tax on liquor: GMOA
	
The GMOA today accused the Finance Ministry of attempting to reduce the tax on liquor through the 2018 budget and said this would encourage the liquor use.
It said despite the national policy of the country which is to prevent the easy access to liquor, the Finance Ministry was attempting reduce tax with the intention of promoting the tourism sector. GMOA spokesman Samantha Ananda said the Finance Ministrys move would destroy the values of the country as it would encourage alcoholism.
It is attempting to create butterflies through rainbow economic goals. Having sold the countrys resources, the government now trying to sell its culture, he said.
Dr. Ananda said the move was a violation of World Health Organisation (WHO) standards and it had strongly suggested that higher tax should be imposed. The GMOA demanded a complete ban of alcohol.
Meanwhile, GMOA Secretary Haritha Aluthge said the GMOA was informed of an attempt to open liquor outlets countrywide at SATHOSA outlets. He said if it was done it would influence liquor consumption. Dr. Aluthge said liquor and tobacco were not essential to the tourism industry and tourists could visit the country to view its landscape and nature.
Tourists dont visit the country because of liquor and tobacco. If the Finance ministry is saying liquor and tobacco is a must to survival of the industry we should not let those drunken tourists enter our country with a great culture, he said. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

HNB partners UnionPay with new ATM acceptance agreement
	
Building on an agreement signed last February, HNB PLC announced a follow-up partnership with UnionPay International to enable ATM acceptance of UnionPay cards.
UnionPay is currently the largest bankcard scheme in terms of cards issued in the world.
The new agreement further consolidates on the relationship between UnionPay and HNB, which was the first domestic bank in Sri Lanka to commence POS acceptance on UnionPay Cards. Management from UnionPay International including Product Director Shuan Ghaidan and Hong Kong, Macau and South Asia General Manager Liu Heng attended an event to commemorate the signing of the agreement with HNB, which is anticipated to enable even greater convenience for cardholders of the increasingly popular network.
Particularly at a time when China continues to be the number one market in the world with the highest number of outbound tourists, this partnership is a timely step towards the facilitation of greater convenience and connection between Sri Lanka and the East Asian region. We believe that this partnership with UnionPay International represents another important step towards establishing greater economic and ultimately social integration with this vibrant region. In that regard, we express our gratitude and look forward working with UnionPay International to further strengthen our partnership moving forward, HNB Managing Director/CEO, Jonathan Alles stated. As the worlds leading payment network, UnionPay International is one of the worlds fastest growing global payment networks and is now accepted in 162 countries and regions with issuance in 42 countries and regions. The payment network initially grew parallel to increased demand for card use from Chinese customers traveling overseas for business, travel and study, however the network has since grown rapidly in popularity outside of China  particularly across Southeast Asia, Northeast Asia, Central Asia, Europe and the United States.
With UnionPay as the leading payment method among Chinese tourists, the demand for local payment and cash withdrawal with our cards continues to increase. Earlier this year, we already joined hands to enable POS business in Sri Lanka; today the further deepened partnership with HNB on ATMs will definitely lead to a win-win situation. We will continue to strive to provide our card users seamless payment services around the globe and as the next step, we look forward to further exploring innovative payment opportunities with HNB in Sri Lanka, UnionPay International Product Director Shuan Ghaidan said.
China is widely projected to become Sri Lankas strongest inbound tourist market in the near future with the tourist industry estimating a 10.4 percent annual increase up to 2021. Such trends are expected to be greatly bolstered by the proposed One Belt One Road initiative mooted by China, which is anticipated to boost tourist arrivals and trade within the region.

Impunity comes through right connections
	
A provincial politico elevated to the purohita status recently is said to be using his influence to shield a fair and lovely one who had defrauded Rs.1.8 million while serving in a co-operative establishment.
The fair one had misappropriated the money which she was expected to deposit in the bank account operated by the establishment.
When a question was raised about this fraud in the provincial body, the purohita had replied that action was being taken to hold an inquiry into the fraud after interdicting the errant party.
However, though about two months have passed since the commission of the offence, no action has been taken to institute an inquiry. The high-ups of the establishment too have failed to pursue the case, they say.

Japanese Prime Minister  Abe wins big in national elections
	

Japans leader has scored a major victory in national elections that returned his ruling coalition to power in decisive fashion. 
Japanese media said Monday that Prime Minister Shinzo Abes Liberal Democratic Party and a small coalition partner had together secured at least 312 seats in the 465-seat lower house of parliament, passing the 310-barrier for a two-thirds majority. Four seats remained undecided. 
The victory boosts Abes chances of winning another three-year term next September as leader of the Liberal Democratic Party. That could extend his premiership to 2021, giving him more time to try to win a reluctant public over to his longtime goal of revising Japans pacifist constitution. 
Abes party and its nationalist supporters have advocated constitutional revisions for years. They view the 1947 constitution as the legacy of Japans defeat in World War II and an imposition of the victors world order and values.In the immediate term, the win likely means a continuation of the policies Abe has pursued since he took office in December 2012 - a hard line on North Korea, close ties with Washington, including defense, as well as a super-loose monetary policy and push for nuclear energy. Stocks rose in Tokyo on Monday morning. 
Abes ruling coalition already has a two-thirds majority in the less powerful upper house. 
With the win, Abe has bounced back from the summer, when his support ratings plunged to 30 percent. 
Abe dissolved the lower house less than a month ago, forcing the snap election.

New Constitution - SL moving towards federal system: Wimalarathana Thera
	
The country will get stuck in a federal system if the new Constitution is implemented, Bellanwila Rajamaha Vihara Chief Incumbent the Ven. Prof. Bellanwila Wimalarathana Thera told a news briefing today.
He said the Government could surreptitiously enact the new Constitution which would harm the entire country.
The attempts to reveal the true nature of the situation that would prevail if the new Constitution was passed, are not indications of attempting to go against the Government, the prelate said. It is an attempt to educate the public. Some elements say the Maha Sangha are creating a fear psychosis among the people to fulfil the aspirations of a third party, which is not true.
The prelate said if the new Constitution was implemented the Provincial Councils would have the authority to take their own decisions, including changing the Poya holidays based on the majority population.
A Provincial Council may even change the national policy according to its needs, he said and added that a close examination of the new constitutional proposals clearly revealed that some proposals were helpful for future peaceful co-existence of all citizens, but the rest were directly supportive of separatist objectives.
The proposals include the diluting of the powers of Parliament, taking away the powers vested in the Executive President to monitor the Provincial Councils through the Governors appointed by the President, to establish a constitutional court that will usurp the existing powers of the Supreme Court to make rulings on the constitutionality of legislation pertaining to key areas such as land matters, to recognise the Northern and Eastern Provinces as one unit through the Constitution itself, eliminate the powers vested with the Central Government to intervene in any provincial issues that have national implications by removing the concurrent list and remove the prevailing provisions for the Government or the Parliament to frame national policies on any subject, the Thera said.
He said the alternate proposals contained in the main document hide the real intention with regard to certain key proposals by the use of words that gave different and conflicting meanings in the three versions of Sinhala, Tamil, and English.
The proposals do not use the term federal directly, it is subtly introduced by the use of words that have different meanings in the three languages. Similarly, the foremost status accorded to Buddhism has been diluted by the introduction of alternative amendments to Article 9 of the Constitution, which have surprised and grieved us immensely. The Maha Sangha are of the view that a new Constitution is not the need of the hour. We stress that even any amendment to the Constitution at this point should be restricted only to those pertaining to bring in amendments to the electoral system. We earnestly request President Maithripala Sirisena, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and the Government to stop all attempts at introducing a new Constitution, the prelate said. "We urge members of the Maha Sangha and all religious leaders of other faiths to come forward without further delay to educate the public and their elected representatives regarding this national crisis situation that is developing, so that all patriotic forces will unite and join hands to reject the proposals for a new constitution that is uncalled for at this juncture.

NZ adds more funds to bring SL jumbo despite court hold up
	
Auckland Council's finance and performance committee meeting on Tuesday had approved a correction of $549,000 to the previous $1.6 million needed to move Sri Lankan elephant Nandi to Auckland, New Zealand media reported.
In May 2011, Auckland Council approved $3.2m to transport two gifted elephants from Sri Lanka to New Zealand.
Anjalee joined veteran elephant Burma at Auckland Zoo in 2015.
A hearing about whether the second elephant, Nandi can be moved to New Zealand is underway after campaigners in Sri Lanka petitioned the Sri Lankan Court of Appeal.
At the committee meeting, Auckland Zoo deputy director Kevin Burley said the court case in Sri Lanka was not about Nandi specifically, but rather the gifting of elephants as a whole.
Anjalee had thrived under the zoo's care and he thought Nandi would thrive also, Burley said.
Councillors Cathy Casey, Efeso Collins, Mike Lee, Wayne Walker and John Watson voted against the decision.
"It's a lot of money to transport an exotic, endangered animal from one part of the world to this part of the world. Two elephants are enough," Casey said.
$1.6m could go a long way for community groups and the council's homelessness programme, she said.
Collins said he was voting against the correction because $549,000 could be used to double council's commitment to homelessness.
Regional facilities Auckland board external relations director Paul Brewer said it was delighted at the correction of $549,000. "There was good robust debate," Brewer said.
If the court in Sri Lanka ruled in its favour, getting Nandi to New Zealand would be quickly underway, he said.
A spokeswoman for Auckland Zoo said it was confident it could give Nandi an excellent home and life but her arrival was ultimately up to the Sri Lankan courts.
"If we subsequently hear definitively that she will have to stay at Pinnawala Elephant Orphanage, then we will then explore what other options are for our elephant programme," the spokeswoman said.
SAFE campaign director Mandy Carter said Nandi had established her own family at the orphanage and an "artificial group" at Auckland Zoo could cause issues.
Residents commented on community website Neighbourly about Auckland Council spending $1.6m on an elephant.
Remuera resident Zoe Spinks said having another elephant at the zoo would attract more visitors.
"I see this as an investment to bring more interest and funding toward conservation, including our own native species," Spinks said.
Grey Lynn resident Jo Ryan said she wondered what Auckland Council's perspective was on spending money on an elephant rather than safe and affordable housing.
"$1.6m could change the lives of many of those who are homeless," Ryan said. (Stuff NZ)

Oceans cant absorb all,  says expert
	
The world appears to be blind to the dreadful consequences of polluting the oceans because of the mistaken belief that the oceans, vast as they are, can absorb anything and still be pristine, laments Admiral Dr. Jayanath Colombage, a former Commander of the Sri Lankan Navy, who is now Director of the Indo-Lanka Initiatives (ILI).
In a paper presented at the SAGAR Dialogue held at Goa in India on October 12, the Lankan sailor turned academic says that the world will be forced to depend even more on the oceans than now, because less and less land will be available for use in the coming years.
But galloping industrialisation and increasing traffic in the seas due to trading are polluting the oceans also. That will have deleterious economic and environmental consequences, unless urgent steps are taken to fight pollution in the high seas as well as on land, Colombage warns.
Oceans as industrial production centres
The Admiral predicts that industrial activities in the ocean will increase with new industries such as renewable energy, sea bed mining, blue bio-technology, blue technology and remediation and restoration of the ocean.
All these activities will add more pollutants to the oceans, unless strict regulatory measures are implemented, Colombage says.
And the oceans potential as an exploitable economic asset is vast and still unfathomed. The oceans cover well over 70% of the earth, but 95% of the underwater world remains unexploited accordingly the Admiral says quoting Dr. P. K. Terney (Potential Challenges and Opportunities of Marine Biodiversity and Ecosystems in Sri Lanka 2017).

Given the presence of a multitude of actors such as State players, law enforcement agencies, researchers, exploiters, smugglers of humans, narcotics and guns, IUU fishers and tourists, the oceans need to be managed, Colombage adds.


Deep sea eco systems, covering nearly 62% the globe, are yet to be discovered. And this area may contain more than 10 million unknown species, Terney adds.
The ocean is the major mode of transportation for 90% of goods in international trade. As per UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) 14, the oceans serve as the largest source of protein, with more than three billion people depending on the oceans for their primary source of protein and over three billion people depend on marine and coastal biodiversity for their livelihoods.
Colombage quotes T. Dhamarathnas 2017 paper entitled: Potential Challenges and Opportunities of Marine Biodiversity and Ecosystems in Sri Lanka, to point out that in the Indian Ocean sea bed, there are heavy minerals such as gem minerals, Ilmenite, Rutile, Zircon, Monazite, Manganese nodules, Phosphates nodules and crude oil and gas which should be available in commercially viable exploitation quantities in the Indian Ocean Region (IOR).
And given the presence of a multitude of actors such as State players, law enforcement agencies, researchers, exploiters, smugglers of humans, narcotics and guns, IUU fishers and tourists, the oceans need to be managed, Colombage adds.
Pollution
There can be ocean-based pollution too. These includes ships accidents (oil and hazardous matter), Explorations (Oil and Suspended matter) and Dumping (Oil and Garbage).
The UN SDG 14 indicates that as much as 40% of world oceans are heavily affected by human activities, including pollution, depleted fisheries, and loss of coastal habitats, Colombage says
As per a report of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administrative Service of US Department of Commerce, 80% of pollution to marine environment comes from the land. Land based pollutants can come from agriculture (fertiliser and pesticide), urbanisation (Disposal sewage and solid waste), industries (effluents and solid waste discharge) dirt, aquaculture projects, and oil from motor vehicles.
Thousands of tons of plastic are dumped into the ocean on a daily basis and plastic is one of the most dangerous pollutants found in the ocean. It is harmful for the environment as it does not breakdown easily and often it is considered as food by marine animals.
Trash and waste dumped into the ocean can be washed up hundreds of miles away. Dumping of toxic waste, chemical waste and radioactive waste are also heavy contributors to ocean pollution.
Chemicals can enter the ocean through various industries, as well as accidents.
All these pollutants can kill large numbers of sea creatures and birds and impact the entire marine eco system. It can impact the reproduction cycle of the marine animals and behavioural changes, finally causing death, the Admiral points out.
This has led to a gradual loss in marine life and an increase in the number of endangered species. Littering causes pollution in the ocean, which also causes a substantial loss of life beneath the seas.
Marine creatures, specially the smaller ones, can absorb these chemicals as part of their food and then enter the food sector on land, he asserts.
Noise pollution in sea
The seas may seem to be quiet except during storms, but there is actually much too much noise in its depths for the marine life there.
Marine life is always disturbed and threatened by a combination of industrial noise, mainly from shipping, seismic exploration and use of air gun and naval sonar. Marine scientist and bio-acoustics expert Clark terms this phenomenon as acoustical bleaching of the oceans, a human-made cacophony that can tear apart the social networks of whales, adversely affecting survival and reproductive success, Colambage says.
According to Clark, whale feeding grounds and migratory routes are then disturbed and they lose breeding opportunity and choices. Further, these loud noises can impact the communication ability of marine mammals which are capable of echolocation.
The sound from seismic air gun explosions, which are mainly used in oil and gas explorations travels through the ocean and it changes from a big bang into a big fuzzy ball of reverberating noise. These bubbles produce a pressure that expand and contract, generating an immense amount of acoustic energy, Colombage says, quoting from R. Schiffmans 2016 paper entitled: How Ocean Noise Pollution Wreaks Havoc on Marine Life, in Yale Environment360.
But the good news is that technologies are being developed to drastically reduce noise from ships and geological surveying.
These technological advances may produce quieter ships which are the main contributor to noise pollution. But there should also be control over the locations, duration and the number of seismic air guns used in explorations, Colombage adds.
Need to go beyond EEZs
However, nations are basically interested only in maintaining their Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZ). The result is that the ocean at large, the common ocean as it were, is nobodys baby  uncared for and left to be misused and unprotected.
There is a need to look beyond state jurisdictions of territorial and EEZs and to treat the oceans as a maritime common, Colombage pleads.

Pan Asia Bank expands green lending facility from Global Climate Partnership Fund
	
Pan Asia Bank and the Global Climate Partnership Fund (GCPF) have closed a new US$13 million facility agreement.
This funding which comes in the form of a seven year senior unsecured loan brings the total funding arrangement between the two parties to US$33 million, which will be utilized to promote green lending initiatives in Sri Lanka.
GCPF has been a partner of Pan Asia Bank in its efforts on mitigating climate change since 2013.
GCPF is an investment fund that provides financing for renewable energy and energy efficiency projects across frontier and emerging economies and is set up as a public-private partnership. The German Federal Ministry for Environment, Nature Conservation, Building and Nuclear Safety, KfW, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Denmark and IFC are among the investors of GCPF.
With GCPF as a partner, Pan Asia Bank has played a pioneering role in introducing green lending initiatives to Sri Lanka. Green lending is a sector of immense importance that supports the growth in Sri Lanka in a socially responsible manner.
Under the agreement with GCPF, Pan Asia Bank will also continue to benefit from a comprehensive Technical Assistance programme, which will enable the bank to strengthen its green lending portfolio of economically viable and climate friendly projects. One of the key initiatives under the Technical Assistance programme is the introduction of a Social and Environmental Management System in the bank, which is in the deployment stage. This initiative makes Pan Asia Bank one of the few banks in Sri Lanka complying with such high standards in responsible lending.
Pan Asia Bank is confident that this funding will create a perfect opportunity to generate long term sustainable economic benefits to uplift the living standards of people by creating cost-efficient energy solutions for businesses and employment, while also preserving our environment.
In addition to contributing towards limiting global warming, this initiative will also result in creating strategic economic benefits to the country as development of renewable energy sources reduce Sri Lankas dependency on imported oil. Inline with the government push for renewable energy Pan Asia Bank is committed towards the success of such projects such as Suriya Bala Sangramaya as one of the pioneers of introducing solar loans to Sri Lanka.
This commitment to green financing and sustainability is taken very seriously at Pan Asia Bank, where a new department named International Relations and Sustainability has been created solely to facilitate investments towards green initiatives as well as to implement sustainability initiatives both within and outside the banks operations.
Commenting on this opportunity, Pan Asia Bank Director/CEO Nimal Tillekeratne highlighted that the GCPF facility seamlessly fits with the business strategy of Pan Asia Bank. The fact that this loan was offered as a seven year senior unsecured loan is a strong indicator of the confidence and trust GCPF has in Sri Lanka and especially in Pan Asia Bank and its growth prospects, he explained. He also stated that due to the successful track record of Pan Asia Bank in promoting green initiatives in Sri Lanka, several foreign funds have indicated their interest to fund similar initiatives through the bank.
Speaking on behalf of the Global Climate Partnership Fund, Board Chairperson Claudia Arce said: We are pleased to continue our very successful partnership with Pan Asia Bank in Sri Lanka. Pan Asia Bank has been acting as a catalyst in encouraging the transition of Sri Lanka to a greener economy  which is exactly what the Global Climate Partnership Fund aims to achieve through its funding activities.

Remembering a great leader  Gamini Dissanayake still lives in the hearts of millions
	
Was the youngest minister in the 1977 cabinet
	Pioneered the Mahaweli Projectand resettlement
	Instrumental in providing elelctricity to rural areas

Gamini Dissanayake an erudite scholar and an Exemplary politician had his education at Trinity College and worked at the Aquinas University College during the rectorship of Rev. Fr. Peter A. Pillai for a short period of time. Later he became an Attorney-at-law. 
He later joined the UNP and gained experience in the field of politics. He was not known among the people at the 1970 election. It was after a six-week intensive campaign from village to village and from house to house with his wife that he was able to win by 2000 votes. 
In 1977, the UNP was brought to power with a record breaking five sixths majority and Gamini was elected the first member of Nuwara Eliya-Maskeliya electorate. 
He was the youngest minister in the cabinet and was offered the Ministery of Irrigation Power and Highways. Later it was land and land development and Irrigation. It was rather unique for him at a relatively young age to have been destined to shoulder the responsibility of two ministries. Later it was changed to Mahaweli Development which undertook the accelerated Mahaweli Development Programme. His aim was to complete the multi-faceted development programme in six years. This was a mammoth task and he was determined to reach the goal with great courage and enthusiasm. To make maximum use of the hydropower potential, he constructed five reservoirs across the Mahaweli River. This paved the way to generate double the necessary electricity to people, especially to the rural folks.

Resettlement took place of nearly 28,000 families from Victoria, Kotmale, Randenigala reservoir areas

Commercial Agriculture was encouraged, and settlement schemes were introduced. Gamini Dissanayake wanted to open new vistas to the middle class. His intention was to upgrade the quality of lives of people and promote economic, social and cultural development of the Mahaweli villages. New markets were introduced to showcase agricultural products. 
Resettlement took place of nearly 28,000 families from Victoria, Kotmale, Randenigala reservoir areas. More than 90 Buddhist, Hindu, Muslim, and Christian places of worship were relocated. Many lands that belonged to his kith and kin were submerged, including his ancestral home. 
He was equally great in managing and developing land as well as human resource management. He also appreciated each and every gesture of his workers. He was always open for consultation and advice. 
Gamini Dissanayake belonged to the unique category of politicians who had the interest of people at heart. He was kind, genuine and thoughtful. He was a dynamic politician to those who were close to him. His charisma and smile mesmerized people. 
During his tenure as President of the Board of Control for Cricket in Sri Lanka [BCCSL], he brought Test status to Sri Lanka in 1981. He also took steps to develop the Asgiriya Grounds, the picturesque venue in the hill capital. 
He entered to contest the Presidential polls after a great political struggle. It was a difficult period for UNP when he led the party. He was determined to bring about a solution to the ethnic issue, but he was killed barely 16 days before the presidential polls. 
People of all walks of life would miss him. We lost a great personality and an inspiring leader who could have done much more for this country. 
Late Premier Dudley Senanayake promised to give a new face to the Nuwara Eliya electorate in 1970, said, 
I have a great liking toward Nuwara Eliya.
I will send a lamp there, andit is your duty to light it.
Don`t worry. I will send you an illuminating lamp
(Translated from YUGA MEHEWARA page 83)

Yes, as he said Gamini Dissanayake was that lamp that illuminated not only Nuwara Eliya but the whole country. He brightened the whole nation with electricity. He lit the lives of the rural people. 
He needs no monument. He lives in the hearts of the people. He who rendered an immeasurable service to the nation and will be remembered today and always.


May he attain Nibbana

(Daily Mail), 22 October 2017 - Former president Jimmy Carter emerged as an unlikely Donald Trump ally on Sunday, saying that the current commander-in-chief gets a raw deal from the media. Carter, speaking to The New York Times, also said he doesnt believe Russia swayed any votes in the 2016 election, despite its best efforts to interfere with Americas democratic process.  Times columnist Maureen Dowd interviewed Carter at his home in Georgia, and heard one other surprising thought process in the Democrats mind: The 93-year-old who was president from 1977 to 1981 would be willing to be Trumps envoy to North Korea.
But Carters view of how Trump has taken a beating in the press is the columns biggest revelation.I think the media have been harder on Trump than any other president certainly that Ive known about, he said. im that Trump is mentally deranged and everything else without hesitation.

SL cautioned of electric vehicle battery disposal woes
	
Disposing of electric vehicle (EV) batteries could become a national issue in the medium to long-term without proper policies, as the first electric cars will begin to require replacements for their batteries shortly, an automobile industry stakeholder told a recent seminar in Colombo.
We need proper disposal guidelines and measurements for EV batteries. Improper disposal will become toxic for the environment, Associated Motorways (Private) Limited (AMW) Deputy General Manager Pradeep Wijerathne told a public consultation seminar organized by the Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka.
Over a dozen other experts and EV enthusiasts speaking at the event, including officials from the state-run Ceylon Electricity Board, too mirrored the sentiments of Wijerathne.
Sri Lanka already has a major crisis in disposing waste. Added to this is Sri Lankas e-waste problem. Currently, in the category of mobile phones alone, there are more in operation compared to the countrys population. Mobile phones are regularly replaced, resulting in a massive pile of e-waste.
The Lithium-Ion EV batteries too are similar to the small mobile phone batteriesthe most toxic component of the devices. However, the EV batteries are considered too large to be land-filled in countries already facing problems with EV battery disposal.
Disposing and recycling EV batteries has become a profitable and scalable industry, since both vehicle manufacturers and governments in many countries have pledged to make EVs the only vehicles in production in another 20-30 years time.
The European Union has tackled the problem of disposal by making EV producers responsible for collecting and recycling the EV batteries. Many middle men have cropped up in Europe, taking contracts from EV producers to engage in such activities.
Wijerathne said that similarly AMW too, as the official agent of Nissan in Sri Lanka, could take charge of disposing EV batteries in the country, and that it has partnered with a German company to export and recycle old EV batteries.
Some of the early models of the Nissan Leaf produced in 2010, bought second hand from Japan, and accounting for over 95 percent of the 4,500 or so of the EV population in the island, may begin to require replacement batteries over the next few years.
An EV battery lasts for around eight years, and ten years at the maximum, Wijerathne said. The battery on the Leaf has an eight-year warranty.
According to him, the Leaf battery, which initially gives the car a range of around 160-170km per charge, falls to around 100-110km per charge at the end of eight years, while in some extreme cases, the range falls to as low as 50km per charge.
He said that some owners in Sri Lanka have already imported and replaced batteries, but that he does not know how these owners disposed their batteries.
A replacement battery for the Leaf costs around US$ 5,500 in the global market, and once accounting for local duties and taxes, would cost more than importing a small Indian car. AMWs replacement charge is Rs. 2 million.
EV owners already face higher maintenance and insurance costs due to the low availability of EV spare parts and batteries, wiping out the gains of low fuel cost.
However, prices are continuously falling due to technological progress.
Wijerathne said that to limit the need to replace EV batteries, the country should bring in a regulation forbidding the importation of EVs more than 6 months old, thus allowing the batteries to be in use for a longer period of time.
In addition to being environmental-friendly, EVs could have a positive effect on the countrys balance of payments compared to vehicles using fossil fuels, since many vehicles are now being encouraged to be charged at off-peak night hours through the national grid, when the load can be managed by indigenous renewable energy power generation.
Many EV owners also own solar panels which contribute to both charging EVs and to the national grid.
The 2018 budget is rumoured to have policies friendly for EV ownership, which would exacerbate the problems related to disposing EV batteries in the future.
The 2015 interim budget, which slashed EV import duties to just 5 percent, saw the importation of over half of the current EVs during that year. Taxes were again raised in 2016, slowing down imports to a trickle.
This inconsistency in policy caused Nissan to delay plans to officially introduce the Leaf to Sri Lanka.
Wijerathne said that the plan may be revisited if the 2018 budget is friendly. (Chandeepa Wettasinghe)

Term of Bond Commission extended by six weeks
	
For the third time, President Maithripala Sirisena has decided to extend the term of the Presidential Commission of Inquiry (PCoI) appointed to investigate the Treasury bond issue by six weeks, sources close to the Attorney General Department said yesterday.
The decision is reported to have taken on the requests made by the AGs Department that more time was needed to complete the investigations into the case before a final report could be handed over to the President in this regard.
Accordingly, the PCoI which was to end its term on October 27, will be extended till December 8.
The three-member committee consisting Supreme Court Judges Kankanithanthri T. Chitrasiri, Prasanna Sujeewa Jayawardena and former Deputy Auditor General Kandasamy Velupillai were elected on January 27 to investigate the Central Bank bond issue.
The PCoI was to end the term firstly on April 27, but its term was extended till July 27.
However, in July the President issued a Gazette extending the term of the PCoI for another three months which ends on October 27. (Shehan Chamika Silva)

Tharanga says he won't quit despite whitewash
	
Responding to the 12th straight defeat in ODIs by Sri Lanka Cricket team and being whitewashed by Pakistan, skipper Upul Tharanga said he would take the blame for the defeats but will not quit from the captaincy.
Prior to 2017, in their history of ODI cricket, Sri Lanka had suffered only one 5-0 whitewash. But this year, they suffered three 5-0 defeats.
The team was whitewashed by India in the home series and then on Monday another heavy 5-0 defeat followed at the hands of Pakistan.
"It's the responsibility of the selectors and the board. I don't want to leave the team and go. The board will decide who will take the team forward," Tharanga told journalists, cricbuzz reported.
"As captain, I would like to take the blame for the defeats. The batsmen also need to take a fair share of the blame. We have to score as a team. Batsmen can fail two or three games, but not all five games. It's tough when we don't perform as a team," Tharanga added.
It was Sri Lanka's 12th straight defeat in ODIs and this year, after 26 games, they have won only four matches. Batting has been Sri Lanka's biggest drawback as they have been kept below the total of 240 in the last 12 games. In the series against Pakistan, Sri Lanka were able to go past 200 runs only twice.
"We repeated the same mistakes. In this game, we were four wickets down in the third over and there was no coming back from thereon. In the last 15 to 18 months, we have struggled with our batting and that has been the main reason why we have come up with below par performances."
Out of the top six batters, only two managed to score more than 75 runs in the series and Sri Lanka didn't even come close to beating Pakistan as their margin of defeats suggest. "We had a lot of discussions. We have analyzed what needs to be done. What we have failed to do is to deliver in the middle.
"What is really disappointing is that these were not unplayable wickets. They were very good tracks. We were just not good enough. Today we tried to change the line-up a little by sending Niroshan Dickwella at number five as he is very good against spin, but we just lost too many wickets earlier on," Tharanga added.

Typhoon leaves two dead after lashing Japan on election day
	

TOKYO AFP Oct23, 2017 -A powerful typhoon left two dead, two missing and dozens injured in Japan Monday, moving northward off the Pacific coast after millions struggled to the polls for a national election. 
Authorities advised thousands living in coastal areas or near rivers to evacuate to shelters before Typhoon Lan, described as very large and very strong, hit Tokyo and surrounding regions early Monday morning. 
The typhoon left the Japanese archipelago by about 9:00 am (0000 GMT) after making landfall in Shizuoka southwest of Tokyo six hours before, the weather agency said. 
Train operators suspended some commuter trains in Tokyo suburbs early Monday and cancelled some Shinkansen bullet trains in northern Japan after a blackout left passengers stranded overnight in the countrys central region. 
Nearly 300 flights scheduled for Monday have already been cancelled, public broadcaster NHK said, after strong winds forced 500 flights to be grounded Sunday.

Unlike ours, Pakistan EC goes to SC: SLPP
	
The Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) said today Pakistans Election Commission Chairman had appealed to that country's Supreme Court about election-related matters, but our EC Chairman had failed to do so though the LG elections were being inordinately delayed.
Party Chairman G.L. Peiris said in Sri Lanka it were the common citizens filing lawsuits in the Supreme Court seeking an order on holding elections.
Commenting on Justice Mark Fernandos 1998 judgement, he said the Judge ruled that elections should not be delayed and that the then Elections Department could take independent decisions.
The Elections Commission should not wait for another year to take action with regard to the postponing of elections. It should act now and carry out its duties and responsibilities, he told a news briefing.
Mr. Peiris said the SLPP was repeatedly questioned and asked to submit several documents and emails prior to being registered as a political party, but the EC had failed to identify Shalila Moonesinghe as a Britisher.
We are not opposed to the EC asking us questions but what is surprising is that it had not been able to identify a Britisher appointed as the chairman of a political party which fielded two presidential candidates, he said.
Mr. Peiris said the government fears an election defeat and therefore keeps postponing elections. We urge the EC to hold elections for local government bodies and provincial councils at the earliest, he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

## Title: Why Victor  is (almost) everything that Elvis and Hendrix were.

Why Victor  is (almost) everything that Elvis and Hendrix were.
	
I encountered Victor Ratnayake in Nugegoda

For Iraj and for Victor. For you and for me.
Three years ago, when I was happily unemployed, I was a joyful drifter, aimlessly wandering here and there. I had some money of my own (Freelancing does pay, though it doesnt pay much), enough for me to roam around and look for ways of earning some more. I remember the month. December. I remember the day. Tuesday. And I remember the appointment. A conversation with Malinda Seneviratne, at his office in Maradana. I was late, though. I needed to get a gift for someone who was to celebrate his birthday soon. Leaving Malinda, I got on the 176 bus to Nugegoda, left Maradana, and waited for my ride to end. It was about 10 in the morning.
The 176, like the 155, is one of those bus routes in this country which seem longer than they actually are. Its also one of those buses in which the act of sitting, curiously enough, is as taxing as the act of standing. (The Rajagiriya flyover bridge, then as now, was not complete, so the strenuous and demanding ride was made even more strenuous and demanding.) One journey is enough; two journeys are too much; and three, if one is to make through them, are so terrible that the only refreshing fact about the end of the third is the hope that one never wades through a fourth. This was the first time, in a long time, I had been on the 176. When it stopped near the Nugegoda Railway Station, I got down and was hit with so much silence that I wondered where I was.
We happy unemployed drifters have a prerogative you unhappy workaholics do not: That of experiencing and encountering a neighbourhood, a community, even an entire city when its least busy outside, when the yuppies are at their offices and the only people walking on the road are drifters, children, housewives, and beggars. Station Lane, which is where the 176 I was in stopped, opened to one such city. Apart from a few shops and a few lottery ticket booths, the entire area from the lane to the station was empty. The perfect getaway for the happy drifter, I thought to myself.
And then, as I was revelling in the fact that I was unemployed and still studying for my law degree, the fact that being alive meant being free of any responsibility towards seniors and co-workers, the loudspeakers along Station Lane blared. At that time of day my ears are accustomed to hearing Sangeeth Wijesuriya (because drifters like me love Sangeeth: He has a voice which reminds you of greasy garages and sweaty palms in the hottest afternoons and the most humid evenings, a voice which has gone by unrecognised, even by those who enjoyed it). This time around, however, it was a different vocalist. Victor Ratnayake. And a different song. Paawe Wala. When that different song and that different vocalist blared out of those loudspeakers, the ticket-booth owners and the drifters and the women, in a scene that would have made Robert Wise proud (Perhaps Im being too optimistic here, but still) sang along.
Victor Ratnayake has that supreme ability of enflaming you, no matter where you are, with his voice. He is the opposite of Amaradeva in that sense, because Amaradeva is didactic even in his most light-hearted songs, while Victor is only didactic off the air, when hes speaking to people like you and me; on air, hes a romantic. Paawe Wala, however, was not written for him; it was written for Mervyn Perera, whose voice was closer to Victors than anyone elses.
The last SA Prasangaya, which I attended two years before despite a fit of depressive anger, unveiled with him remembering the man who graciously conceded that song. I am a Buddhist, he was a Christian. I wish that he attains the supreme bliss of Nibbana, he told us after he performed it.
If I cant think of another vocalist who can inspire so much in us that we forget our worries and sing about love in the middle of the road and during the middle of the day without realising how self-consciously young we become, its because there isnt one.
Even at this stage in his life and career, the man reminds you of how young you once were. This has as much to do with his voice as it does with the two lyricists he has resorted to the most frequently: Premakeerthi de Alwis and Sunil Ariyaratne, both of whom wrote copiously on love. He doesnt really care what styles he goes for: Jana Gee or Carnatic, slow or fast paced, his compositions reverberate with the kind of liveliness which his performances do.
He made me dance through Kundumani, Malinda wrote of Premakeerthi. That sense of immediacy comes through the composition, that honest-to-ethnic-origin melody, as well. What Victors work leaves behind, for you to savour, is neither aggressive nor didactic, but it isnt completely romantic either. Its a different form of romanticism: rather conservative, never completely free. Almost as though hes afraid of reminding us of our youth. As though well go mad, and depressed, if we are reminded of it in the first place.
Some of his best songs transcend that conservative streak and yield to our deepest impulses. Thats where Victor is at his loveliest,
Id like to think. Sanda Hiru Tharu has him sing about the collective, secular, extraordinary joy of samsaric living; Sara Sonduru has him and Nanda Malini explore the poignancy of winning and then losing a first love; Mihiren Ma Dinu has him reflect on the first impressions of passing beauty, faintly registered, never rationalised.

Perhaps thats why we love him so much, yet still feel uneasy about loving and giving into what we think he stands for. We are afraid of expressing our love, forgetting all the while that what we misconceive as love wasnt what most of our ancestors thought it to be.


The latter two, incidentally, were composed by Premasiri Khemadasa; Victor never sang Khemadasas compositions in the SA Prasangaya, nor did he record them again.
He has his reasons, but listening to them today makes one wish that he revisited them. They are some of the most innocently lovely works I have come across in our sarala gee tradition. And not for no reason: If a lesser vocalist had sung them, they would have lost that delicate welter of innocence and set off lewd speculations about who was singing about whom.
It has been said of Elvis and Hendrix that young women wanted to love them and young men wanted to be like them. If I sound blasphemous there, rest assured I didnt say it: Professor Carlo Fonseka did, five years ago around the time of the last SA. Now Professor Fonseka has a habit of comparing the artiste to the most primitive sample of our species. He did that with Malani Fonseka, he did that with Victor Ratnayake. To him, the singer and the actor is first and foremost a man or a woman.
It is reasonable to suppose that a tribe strongly bonded by music will have the edge in the struggle for existence over a less musical tribe, he wrote.
Had I written it, with my deplorable understanding of both music and biology, I would have been put down as a heretic. Such heretical thoughts belong to those who have specialised in the fields which produce them. In that sense the Professor is right.
Victor Ratnayake is (almost) everything that Elvis and Hendrix were. But thats not his real achievement. His real achievement has been his ability to be an Elvis, a Hendrix, a Robert Plant, within the confines of our closely knit, repressive, and traditionalist society. Perhaps thats why hes so rousingly didactic outside, and so rousingly romantic inside. We all operate on such a dichotomy, after all.
And perhaps thats why we love him so much, yet still feel uneasy about loving and giving into what we think he stands for (which, incidentally, happens to be what he DOES stand for). We are afraid of expressing our love, forgetting all the while that what we misconceive as love wasnt what most of our ancestors thought it to be. The at times wildly divergent reactions the man gleaned from us, his single biggest audience, last year and this year, indicates that he is what he sings, and not what he says.
Outside he can rabble about the importance of staying true to the past while the contemporary singer bemoans it, but the truth is that he makes us fall in love with our younger selves in far greater ways than that contemporary singer.So when that singer tries to get even with the man in the most imaginative way he THINKS is possible, he is both at the peak of his popularity and at the receiving end of the most intense vitriol he can inspire.
He has defiled the deified. Done what he should not have done.
Cary Grant, the most romantic of all romantic screen personalities the world ever knew, once said that even he wanted to be Cary Grant. It took a great many decades for him to become himself. Men were afraid of him and wanted to emulate him; they could never be him.
Victor Ratnayake has always been like that. He inspires both infatuation and confusion, on our part and on his own terms. He speaks for what went by, yet sings of what is. He is caught in the past, yet transfixed on the present. Its tough to come up with another vocalist, another artiste, who thrives and flourishes on such a strange, oxymoronic combination of reverence and daring. People can go on hoping that they are less like him when it comes to being young, being themselves. At the end of the day, however, when they discover that he is, in fact, more of what they want to be, and much more of what they will never be, they will parody him using all sorts of ways: the media, the blogosphere, YouTube. They will fail, not because they havent tried, but because in emulating and parodying him, they are emulating and parodying that strange mixture of nostalgia and youth he lives on. The truth is that hes both nostalgia and youth. The truth is that no parodist is going to change that.

Will take action on Wimals bomb remarks: Speaker
	
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya said today he would take suitable action on the remarks made by MP Wimal Weerawansa to bomb Parliament.
Issuing a statement, the Speaker's media unit said the matter would be discussed in Parliament as soon as it was convened.
It said National Freedom Front (NFF) leader and MP Weerawansa was alleged to have said that there was a necessity to bomb Parliament.
The media unit said the members of the government, opposition and other factions had drawn Speaker Jayasuriyas attention to Mr. Weerawansas remarks as it posed a threat to the security and well being of all parliamentarians, officials and other employees of Parliament.
All these factions requested the Speaker to take the threatening remarks made by MP Weerawansa seriously, it said. (Sandun A. Jayasekera)
