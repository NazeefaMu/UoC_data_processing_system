A voice in the wilderness
	
Reviewed by Fr Chryso Pieris SJ, Galle
All authentic prophets, modern or ancient, are voices in the wilderness yet never wavering from their stand, never compromising with power, prestige or pelf, always consistent, comprehensive and compassionate.
Dr Mervyn D. De Silva is one such rare prophet from Sri Lanka in our times. I had, now and then, read some of his articles in the newspapers but this collection is a real boon to all those who are interested in the common good of not only the people of Sri Lanka, especially the poor, but of the whole world.
The world today, for those who have eyes to see and ears to hear and for intelligent and objective observers, has sunk into decadence, economically, socially, culturally, morally, ethically and seems to be immersed in a quagmire of unprecedented superficiality. There are wars between nations, ethnic and religious groups, social upheavals between haves and have-nots, heinous forms of crimes, domestic violence, political violence, breakdown of law and order, revolutions and counter-revolutions; corruption by the mightiest, politicians, bankers and businessmen, blatant violations of time-honored principles and codes of conduct and decency; blatant violation of constitutions, democracy, the judiciary and the executive organs of administration. - Page 9.
Though the author starts this paragraph with the words The world today actually it is all about the current ugly situation in our own country, Sri Lanka.
And that is what the subtitle of the book says:
The failed Neoliberal Paradigms of Economics, Politics, Governance, Society and Science in Sri Lanka and Globally
Agriculture is the speciality of Dr Mervyn and eradication of poverty is his chosen goal in life. For him, the two are connected but the powers that be are so ignorantly and culpably superficial about this connection it is tragic.
 the governments undertaking utterly puerile tamashas in the rural paddy fields (1977) and farmer seminars in the capital city (1996) reveals the truth that the crux of the success of the modern techniques of food production and the massive support it requires have not been properly understood by the rulers.  page 34.
Dr De Silva consistently shows that the root cause of every unjust and evil aspect of society is economic poverty.
Whether it is hunger and starvation, violence and terrorism, overseas slave labour and human trafficking, drugs and prostitution, inequality and income disparities, ill health and failure in education, are all due to the basic fact that the majority cannot make ends meet at the end of the day.
For him, the eradication of poverty is a top priority and the ethical, moral, social and political imperative of any responsible government.
His scathing attacks on the Washington Consensus Institutions, The World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the World Trade Organization are unmatched by any leftist rhetoric.
Nothing escapes his eagle eye: Glasnost-Perestroika, GATT and RCN (Remote Control Neo-Colonial Status) Debt Crisis and Aid, Structural Adjustments, Mad Cow Disease, Free Market, Super NGOs, Privatization and Ecological Disasters.

"If the people lead, the leaders will follow our attempts to end this unapologetic barbarism. Rise up to the occasion please"
He exposes their hidden agendas, double standards and hypocrisy, objectively and fearlessly.
He was in the Ministry of Planning and later an MP in the Sirimavo Bandaranayake Government.
He comments on why planning became an anathema, what the proper role of the Ministry is, the Presidential responsibilities, performance monitoring and reorganization of the Ministry.
He reveals with great clarity and responsibility how democracy in our country began to erode from the seventies onward. Today it is a mere faade and the people are left utterly helpless, politically stranded and their dignity dragged in the mud.
The articles are all relevant to the immediate socio-political needs of the country; searching for solutions to vital problems; analyzing the situation and critiquing it; but always Dr Mervins basic tenets are clear and demanding; the unitary status of the country, the inalienable sovereignty of the people, a legislature of honest, committed ladies and gentlemen untainted by corruption and nepotism and the top priority of a sustained campaign to eradicate poverty not in some hazy future but within a planned rational time frame and clear deadlines.
A victim of Government wrath when he exposed the Dambala Hoax Dr De Silva has paid dearly for his uncompromising stand against injustice, dishonesty and corruption.
Dr De Silva insists that there can be no question of abandoning those in need. Director of Tulana Fr Aloysius Pieris SJ states.
The dire need of the hour, if we want to save this country intact for another generation, is for us all good and honest people to rouse ourselves and work together to bring about the downfall of the present governing kleptocracy; this indeed is the last plea of Dr Mervin in his collected articles; it is on page 302;
Patriotic countrymen with brains, guts and courage take up the gauntlet, get on the phones, make e-mail connections, contact anyone prepared to help, assemble groups, contact professional associations, inspire confidence, do more and talk less, dont throw cold water. Lets take one step in the right direction. If the people lead, the leaders will follow our attempts to end this unapologetic barbarism. Rise up to the occasion please.
I dream somebody taking his articles and translating them into Sinhala and Tamil and publishing them, one by one, serially, in our national vernacular newspapers. I wish very much my dream comes true soon.
The book itself is a beauty, thanks to the Media Unit of the Tulana Research Centre led by Robert Crusz, Sudath Attanayake and the printers Karunaratne & Sons (Pvt) Ltd.

Blast at election centre in Afghanistan kills dozens
	

The death toll in an Islamic State suicide bombing at a national ID distribution centre in Kabul has climbed to at least 31, a health official said.
At least 54 others injured in the incident have been transported to hospitals across town, Afghan Public Health Ministry spokesman Wahidullah Majroh said.
Majroh had earlier said that 57 people were injured in the blast.
The on-foot suicide bomber set off his explosive vest outside the ID distribution centre in a Shiite-dominated, western neighbourhood of Kabul, Interior Ministry spokesman Najib
Danish said.
Emergency, an Italian NGO operating a hospital for war victims in Kabul, said at least 42 people injured in the bombing had been admitted to its trauma centre.
The centre targeted in the attack was set up to provide national IDs to voters ahead of parliamentary and provincial council elections slated for October.
Such centres have been set up by the Afghan government in hopes of increasing turnout - those without ID cannot receive a voter registration card.
The Islamic State terrorist organization claimed responsibility for the attack through its mouthpiece, the Amaq news agency.
Afghan President Ashraf Ghani and Chief Executive Abdullah Abdullah were among those to condemn the attack.
Security is one of the main concerns for voter registration and elections as a resilient insurgency shackles Afghan forces to the battlefield throughout the country.
More than 40 per cent of polling stations for Afghan parliamentary elections could be subject to security risks affecting voter participation, an election monitor said late last month.
Mohammad Yousuf Rashed, executive director of the Free and Fair Election Forum of Afghanistan (FEFA), told dpa that out of around 7,400 polling stations due to be set up for the vote, 948 are in areas out of government control - meaning under Taliban control.

They further called for the sustainable return of all such displaced Rohingya sheltered in Bangladesh to their rightful home in Myanmar under UNHCR oversight, it added.
Attended by Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, CHOGM also called for action to address the root causes of the crisis, including through the immediate implementation of the Rakhine Advisory (Kofi Annan) Commissions recommendation.

Country can move forward only under a non-partisan President: Wijeyadasa
	
There is no point in forming national governments amidst a culture of levelling allegations against each other and it is more advantageous for the country to move forward under a non-partisan President, said former Minister MP Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe in Kandy on Sunday.
Mr. Rajapakshe expressed this view when he met the Mahanayake of Asgiriya Chapter Most Ven. Warakagoda Sri Gnanarathana Thera and the other Anunayakes of the Asgiriya Karaka Sabah.
Speaking further he said that the non-partisan President whom they brought into power has now got entangled in a political imbroglio.
The SLFP which he gave leadership has now broken into three. The UNP has been subjected to an erosion. If democracy is to forge ahead in a country the parties should be strong, he said. (J. A. L. Jayasinghe)

GMOA to take TU action against KDU Bill
	
The GMOA today said it would join other anti-SAITM groups to launch trade union action if the government attempts to pass the proposed Kotelawala Defence University (KDU) Bill.
It said though the GMOA asked the Government to enroll the SAITM students at the KDU, the governments mechanism to do so had further aggravated the issue.
GMOA Secretary Haritha Aluthge told a news conference that the proposed KDU Bill violates the the Medical Ordinance and the University Act.
He said if the Bill bypasses the need for the Act 16 examination and that the need for a compliance certificate would be nullified because the Bill also challenges the role of the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC).
Dr. Aluthge said the proposed Bill was prepared by University Grants Commission (UGC) Chairman Mohan de Silva and Sanjaya Rajaratnam of the Attorney Generals Department with the intention of safeguarding SAITM.
GMOA will meet anti-SAITM groups on Friday to decide who they should continue the struggle.
Meanwhile, the GMOA executive committee is to meet on May 3 with regard to the trade union action. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

Great Place To Work ranks 99X Technology among Asias Best for 2018
	
A people-first approach and an inclusive workplace culture, strengthened by employee trust, has seen 99X Technology being named one of Asias Best Workplaces for 2018, by the Great Place To Work Institute. The company made its mark among over 1,200 organisations that participated in the survey process, representing the voices of more than two million employees across nine countries.
Although a regular entrant on the Sri Lankan index of great workplaces, this marks99X Technologys second foray into the regional list, having previously been listed on the Asian Index back in 2015. This places the company amongst regional and global giants including Cisco, Salesforce, DHL, Hilton Worldwide, Omnicom Media Group, Godrej Consumer Products, The Oberoi Group and more.
Our greatest asset has always been our employees and over the years, we have striven to take every measure to create a workplace culture that fuels our peoples passion and innovation, in which they can truly unlock their full potential. Continuously strengthening and bettering this ecosystem is something we work on unceasingly. It is therefore extremely encouraging to have these efforts validated by Great Place To Work and be recognised among the best workplaces in Asia, observed 99X Technology Co-Founder and CEO Mano Sekaram, while commenting on this achievement.
Some of the pillars of this ecosystem include a flat organisational structure with self-organising teams, the creation of Blue Oceans that let employees challenge themselves in areas outside their core job roles and encouragement of Leaders Without Titles that inspires people to take on new responsibilities irrespective of their job role. Yet, it was some of the companys smaller initiatives, such as the Six Pack Factory Challenge  a company-wide fitness competition, and ShoutOut Boxes  an innovative method of receiving employee feedback anonymously, that really helped 99X Technology stand out among the rest.
The 65 companies that make up the 2018 Best Workplaces in Asia list outshone the rest in their commitment to caring for their employees and providing environments where they can thrive. An impressive 92% of employees at this years best say that their company is a great place to work.
The 2018 Best Workplaces in Asia are an inspiration to organizations around the globe. These companies live and breathe the For ALL philosophy by building meaningful experiences for every employee and by positively impacting their communities, said Great Place to Work CEO Michael C. Bush.
Since 2015, Great Place to Work has identified the top organizations that create great workplaces in the Asia Pacific and Middle East regions through publishing the annual Best Workplaces in Asia list. The list recognizes companies in three size categories: Small & Medium (20-500); Large (501+); and Multinational. To be considered for inclusion, companies must appear on one or more of the national lists in one of the nine countries represented on the list and meet the minimum quantitative threshold on the Trust Index survey. The survey period for the 2018 Best Workplaces in Asia list took place between 2017-2018.

Indian President signs ordinance on death penalty for child rape
	

DPA, 22nd APRIL, 2018-Indian President Ram Nath Kovind has signed an ordinance that allows stringent punishments for sexual violence against children, including the death penalty for those convicted of raping girls below the age of 12 years.
The Indian government had passed the ordinance on Saturday, facing public anger over recent cases of rape of young girls.
An 8-year-old girl was gang-raped and murdered in the state of Jammu and Kashmir while in Uttar Pradesh a 16-year-old girl was allegedly gang-raped by a ruling party lawmaker, triggering nationwide outrage and protests. The ordinance was signed into law by President Kovind and an official notification to the effect was published on the government gazette on Sunday. It will be valid for six months, during which it has to be ratified by the parliament. The new law introduces the maximum punishment of the death penalty for those who rape children under 12 years. Under the earlier law, the maximum punishment for child rape was life in prison. The minimum punishment is a 20-year jail term or life imprisonment.

## Title: Lalith:  An invincible legacy

Lalith:  An invincible legacy
	

The 23rd day of April, 1993, was among a handful of blots in our national hall of shame. It was the day on which a lone gunman, perhaps with conspirators yet unknown, acted to neutralize a political threat by depriving all Sri Lankans of the intellectual gifts, charisma, service and dedication of one our finest politicians, Lalith William Samarasekara Athulathmudali. Much like Gamini Dissanayake, slain on October 24, 1994, and President Ranasinghe Premadasa, killed on May 1,1993, Lalith was targeted and snuffed out because his vision, mission and political savvy made him so dangerous that his opponents realized they could only ever prevail against him in the public arena by violently ending his life.
25 years later, the pattern could not be clearer. By killing Gamini Dissanayake, the LTTE spared themselves of a fierce opponent with unmatched local and international support to eradicate them. The LTTE, having killed President Premadasa, rid themselves of a leader who had even belatedly wise up to their treachery. Those who killed Lalith were spared of the relentless onslaught of a parliamentary dynamo who could at whim rally politicians of any stripe to his cause. This he aptly demonstrated through his role in assembling the 1991 impeachment motion against President Premadasa, who himself was brought to a violent end on May Day in 1993, just days after Lalith was shot dead. I was first introduced to Lalith Athulathmudali by my father. From that moment to this day, I still remain in absolute awe of the man. I remember that first day. I was nervous. I was hesitant. I was afraid I would say the wrong thing or ask the wrong question, and be quelled by his signature repartee. When Lalith spoke to me, his distinction as a man, a politician and an intellectual giant was apparent from his first words. His voice projected culture, clarity of mind and confidence. He articulated and enunciated every word he spoke, with a measure and delivery that seemed subconsciously tailored to his audience. It was no accident that people found it extremely easy to understand him.
While I remember Lalith as intellectually arrogant, he was open to new ideas. Like a judge in a courtroom of yore, he would listen carefully and patiently, and ask probing questions, and at the end of a fruitful dialogue, he would adapt new ideas into his own world view. In this way and others, he always projected himself as a leader. He was convinced that he was invincible. Those around him drew the same conclusion. 
At first glance, he could appear aloof and unapproachable but everyone who knew him well has their own story of how he warmed to them in his own unique way. Once you got to know him, he was always amiable. He always made time for you. It was easy to get close to him.
Even as a school boy, I vividly recall that one could call Lalith, leave a message and he would always call you back. Of that you could be certain. His interest in the children and youth of this country was altruistic. He believed in inculcating the next generation with the correct values, skills and drive to elevate Sri Lanka to be first among its peer nations.
Just talking to Lalith was an education in itself  no matter what the subject, just talking with him or even listening to him opened entirely new vistas, hitherto unexplored by the limitations of our own minds. A brilliant combination of Harvard and Oxford, he firmly believed that education was the only way to rid Sri Lanka  and for that matter, the world  of poverty, and he sought to further that belief through action every chance he got.
Lalith was already the stuff of legend by the time I first met him. My association with him only confirmed that the legend was true. He never let any setback, or any person get him down. He always rose above whatever hand fate dealt him. When he was demoted to Agriculture Minister, he bravely compared himself to four former Prime Ministers who had also been Agriculture Ministers during their tenures.
He did the best he could in that position, got the best people possible, and fought all the way to make a difference and serve people in that portfolio.
I was once privileged to listen to, what I then thought, was the finest Parliamentary speech ever given on the no confidence motion against M.H. Mohamed. That brilliant oration went down in history, but sadly, it happened to be his last speech in the House. That was not just his last speech, but his last great Parliamentary speech. A perusal of the Hansard in the 16 years he was in Parliament would show that he was among our best and certainly the finest intellectuals in Parliament in the post-1977 period. Those from-the-heart-and-mind speeches of his would make most present day, self-proclaimed academics and intellectuals, in and out of Parliament, look small indeed.
Lalith had a tremendous capacity to identify talent but he also made the mistake of trusting people too much, sometimes to his own detriment. This was a weakness to which, of course, he would never confess. He never admitted to being wrong about anything.
The implicit faith he placed in people was remarkable. During the politically tumultuous time of President Ranasinghe Premadasas impeachment, he would have confidential discussions with my father, despite the fact that my fathers brother was even then attached to the Presidential Secretariat. Yet, he confided in my father without the slightest doubt or suspicion that he would be quoted or that someone would get the better of him because of those disclosures.

"Lalith articulated and enunciated every word he spoke, with a measure and delivery that seemed subconsciously tailored to his audience"
In the theoretically flawed lexicon of politics, Lalith would be classed right-wing, but he did more by way of redistribution of wealth than most avowedly socialists did or envisioned.
Mahapola was his brainchild and thousands upon thousands have benefited from this scholarship scheme. He was a senior minister in a government that was dubbed anti-nationalist but was staunchly patriotic in intent, conduct and in the results he delivered to his electorate and his nation.
He was more than just a statesman who towered above his colleagues in this country. He held his own anywhere in the world. He lectured in the Law Colleges of Singapore, Malaysia and even Israel, and delivered his first speech in the German language to a standing ovation when he was Trade Minister. Intellectually, Lalith was truly invincible. This country has not seen, and sadly may never see, the likes of him again.
Well, hes gone. Today, our duty is to rise above the temptation to indulge in fruitless reminiscing, and indeed to ponder deeply on the paucity of such leaders in our country and remember that had Lalith lived, he would have taken this country to great heights. In him, this nation saw the intellectual capacity and the indomitable will-power to make Sri Lanka live up to her full potential.
Now, two and a half decades after his murder, and the murder of nearly every other mind in his league of extraordinary leaders, and given a political landscape utterly barren of talent, competence, energy and vision, one is persuaded to think of the what ifs.
It is perhaps a tragedy that ours was not to be a world in which the likes of Lalith, Gamini Dissanayake and Ranasinghe Premadasa could combine their talents to take Sri Lanka forward. Sometimes political territories are too small for several giants to inhabit at the same time. Arrogance gets in the way. Egos get in the way. They were human, after all. Sadly the death of these three political heavyweights within a short space of time, is a loss from which the United National Party has since never properly recovered. Since their demise, the party has struggled to find politicians who could straddle the political stage with such prowess and oratorical brilliance; it has struggled to find leaders who can walk among the people, and feel their joys and their fears. And the country has suffered deeply as a result. 
Perhaps the poverty of our circumstances makes him look larger in retrospect than he truly was and persuades us to extrapolate further than we ought to. But whichever way one looks at it, he was exceptional.
Where today, could Sri Lanka point to a political leader who is punctual to a fault, brings intellectual horsepower, creativity and political savvy together to a policy decision-making process, and who would support their troops with gratitude when they succeed together, and with fierce loyalty when things go wrong. Lalith never left his people hanging out to dry. 
Lalith, when the long history of our post-Independence era is written, will receive the plaudits of even the most acerbic of his critics. As we commemorate the 25th anniversary of this great mans supreme sacrifice today, we are saddened and reminded of everything Sri Lanka could have been under his direction and leadership.
In his death, 25 years ago, Lalith Athulathmudali rendered us a poorer nation indeed.

Let Sajith, Navin bat for party: Ranjan tells UNP hierarchy
	
UNPers such as Sajith Premadasa and Navin Dissanayake should be allowed to play a major role in running the party, Deputy Minister Ranjan Ramanayake said today.
Members like Sajith and Navin should be allowed to bat now that Mr. Wickremesinghe had got several chances to bat for the party, he said using cricketing jargon at a media briefing last morning. "Mr. Wickremesinghe batted in 2002 and got a century. He batted again in 2004 and got out. In 2010 and 2015 the UNP imported players such as Sarath Fonseka and Maithripala Sirisena. Now it is time for the others to be given a chance to bat."
The deputy minister said this while pointing out that Sri Lanka Cricket Chairman Thilanga Sumathiapala should not contest for a second term and give someone else the chance to run the cricket Board and that what applies to the SLC chief must apply to party leaders as well.
As an actor, who is growing old, I am hoping to stop playing the lovers role in movies and play a fathers character. Likewise the older political leaders should give a chance to the juniors, he added.
When asked whom he would recommend as the UNP's next leader, the deputy minister said it was too early to name a person and pointed out that a new leader should be named and should take over the party by 2019.
We should not make the mistake made by the joint opposition by naming former defense secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa as their presidential candidate. The JO has given its opponents the opportunity adequate time to run negative campaigns against its candidate. We in the UNP named our candidate for the 2015 presidential elections 2015 only in November 2014 and thus Mr. Sirisena was able to avoid much mudslinging, he said. (Yohan Perera)

National Archives, information, rights and challenges
	

Dr. Nadeera Rupesinghe, the new Director-General of the revamped National Archives of Sri Lanka, is determined to turn it into a user-friendly, world-class institution.
A scholar specializing in Dutch Period Studies and only the second woman Director General of the National Archives, she took time off from her busy schedule to show me around the spacious building.
It was a far cry from the hot, humid structure I frequented a decade ago. Much of it is now air-conditioned and the entrance area was cordoned off for repairs.
There is nothing inside which now looks neglected. In a country where, more often than not, neglect is the legacy of institutions and structures related to culture and heritage, this came as a pleasant surprise indeed.
The National Archives building, whose first wing was opened in 1976, is actually an impressive building, designed by architect Pani Tennekoon, whose reputation is not what it should be, perhaps because he worked for the Government Sector.
It is a very modern and graceful design and makes one think of Le Corbusier and the international style.
The interior is very spacious and accessible.
Dr Rupesinghe, a much-travelled scholar, maintains that Sri Lanka can be proud of its National Archives when compared to similar institutions in many parts of the world.
She notes too, that it is easily accessible to everyone, including foreigners, with a minimum of red tape, in contrast to archives in the Indian subcontinent, where scholars are sometimes required to get Police clearance.Formerly a lecturer in history of science and technology at the Open University, she turned down a Senior Lecturer Post there and opted to take this position in August 2017.
As we walked along the spacious corridors, which overlook the spacious lobby, she showed me a series of portrait paintings of former Governors of the island, starting from the Dutch period till independence from Britain in 1948, and some of our national leaders since then.
These paintings are enigmatic. They are oils, and very few carry the artists signature. Most probably, they date from the latter part of the British Period. The surfaces of these portraits do not show any cracks, which happens to oils as they age. In that case, however, how the artist found out the likenesses of subjects from the Dutch period remains a mystery.
Portrait painting was big business in the Netherlands, when the Dutch ruled the coastal areas of this country. Unless the artist had access to family portraits of that period, the works must be from the imagination.
These may not be the work of a Dutch artist because the style doesnt correspond to that period.
In fact, the Dutch portraits arent really very good because, though the artist has drawn the faces and figures competently, the hands often look amateurish.
I feel that the origin of these Dutch Period paintings is just one of the many mysteries of the National Archives waiting to be deciphered.
There is no count of the number of publications stored in here. Instead, one speaks of kilometres  there are twenty-two kilometers of stored documents, and Dr. Nadeera says there is enough storage space for the next fifty years.
That she is a scholar fluent in Dutch has special relevance here because the concept of modern archives goes back to Dutch times and there are over 7,000 Dutch language volumes at the National Archives, and over two-thirds have been microfilmed.
The Dutch kept meticulous records everywhere they went, and trade and diplomacy meant that their different colonies were linked by this archival tradition.
For example, Indonesia, which the Dutch ruled as Batavia, has records relevant to Dutch-period Sri Lanka.
Dr Rupesinghe shows me one of the leather-bound volumes, called Thombu, in which they kept details of all important land transactions.
The curlicued handwriting in ink, though fading with time, is still quite distinct and one can marvel at both the quality of paper, the dedication and patience which went into this routine administrative task.
Two-thirds of the Dutch documents have been microfilmed.
We visit the air-conditioned reading room where scholars poring intently over parchment-like pages. Though the new archives, is a far cry from the old one, it is still acutely short of staff. It has 117 employees whereas the required number is 292.
Dr Rupesinghe assures me that this is due to red tape rather than lack of funding.
Another glaring deficit is the lack of Tamil staff. There are only two Tamil speaking employees, and this is a handicap especially during the surveys conducted by the National Archives throughout the island. About eighty such surveys are carried out annually, during which government ministries and other agencies are visited and their record keeping checked.
The National Archives is the official registrar of all books and newspapers published in Sri Lanka. Every printer in the country is required to send five copies of each printed publication to the National Archives.

"In an age of rapid digitisation, the National Archives maintains the old-fashioned tradition of keeping hard copies because, as Dr Rupesinghe points out, digitisation is an expensive process because digital storage systems and formats become obsolete very quickly, and the constant upgrading is a big financial strain "
In the past, one of these copies was acquired by the British Library. But this practice has now been stopped, and that copy is now sent to the University of Ruhuna instead.
This leads to the vital subject of record management.
Dr Rupesinghe says:
We are responsible for taking care of a public document even before it is created, in order to ensure the integrity of that document and to ensure that in the final disposal action selected documents are transferred to the National Archives. It is in that context that we receive documents after twenty-five years or in some cases less from government institutions. But it is important to care for documents from the moment of creation, and not just when some documents that manage to survive or are salvaged are transferred to the archives and then they become archives.
The term archives refers to both the institution that holds the documents and the documents themselves. If they come to us as an afterthought, we often face an uphill task of meeting their conservation needs. In an ideal world, we should work towards being no difference between records and archives.
An artificial division has been created that does not facilitate proper custodianship of Government records. This aspect of record management has become especially important in Sri Lanka with the Right to Information Act. No. 12 of 2016, which has the potential to revolutionalise governance in this country. Freedom of information or right to information legislation, however, is ineffective if proper record management practices are not in place in all government institutions, if the information is not easily retrievable, or if it is lost.
In this context, the National Archives holds training programmes for Government officials on the importance of record management.
Providing access to public records in a key responsibility of the National Archives.
It is common for archives to collaborate by exchanging copies of their collections. The National Archives is bound by law to either acquire originals or copies of archival collections of interest. Dr Rupesinghe has received sales offers by the British Pathe film company and the British Library, the former offering old documentary films from Sri Lanka from 1916 onwards, while the latter offered digitized copies of British East India Company documents, for sale by the company which carried out the digitisation.
But these rights of use are sold at very high prices, said Dr Rupesinghe.
That represents one model of meeting the high demand for digitization in the archival world  of getting private companies to carry out the digitization and then awarding them the rights of resale.
Another method, which we are trying to establish with the Hague Archives, is to mutually exchange digital collections relevant to the two institutions and to make such collections available worldwide to researchers on a non-profit basis.

"Another glaring deficit is the lack of Tamil staff. There are only two Tamil speaking employees, and this is a handicap especially during the surveys conducted by the National Archives throughout the island"
The latter model facilitates more widespread research and encourages the exchange of knowledge and capacity building between archival institutions, an essential way forward of survival in the still emerging field of archival science and in meeting the increasing demands for archival and records management in a country.
In an age of rapid digitisation, the National Archives maintains the old-fashioned tradition of keeping hard copies because, as Dr Rupesinghe points out, digitisation is an expensive process because digital storage systems and formats become obsolete very quickly, and the constant upgrading is a big financial strain.
That is why the National Archives prefers to maintain its microfilm process.
Visiting the studio and laboratory where the microfilming is done and the film is processed was like stepping back in time.
The black and white images are captured in the negative film, which comes in 100 ft cans, and the photography is done with two special cameras. The processing is done with a developing machine.
The section where books and newspapers are bound and pressed has equipment dating back to the early and mid-20th century.
Several government institutions such as the Government Press had similar machinery, but everything has been discarded and destroyed as updating and modernisation took place over the past two decades.
Dr Rupesinghe, on the contrary, believes some of this antique equipment should be preserved as museum pieces.
It is the contrast between the old and the new which makes the National Archives such a fascinating place today. The National Film, TV and Sound Archives was opened as part of the complex in 2014. While the TV and sound archives still doesnt contain much, the film section as 274 Sri Lankan feature films handed over by the National Film Corporation as well documentaries. The feature films are mostly in colour and date from the 1980s. The older films are mostly in the hands of a few so-called conservationists who have neither the knowledge nor the facilities to conserve them scientifically.
They should visit the temperature and humidity-controlled storage rooms of the archives, and hand over their collections for the benefit of the public domain.
The spacious lobby has been closed for renovation. When this is done, Dr Rupesinghe envisages a user-friendly space hosting public events, ensuring that the National Archives will not remain a cloistered, somewhatintimidating institution.

No Chinese militarization of Htota Port: PM
	
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has rejected the reports of Chinese militarization of the Hambantota Port.
When Chinese Ambassador Cheng Xueyuan called on the Prime Minister on Friday, the Premier said, There is no issue of Chinese militarization of the Hambantota Port at all. Sri Lankan Navy is the sole military force responsible for the security of the Port, he said.
At the meeting, it has been noted that some foreign media irresponsibly hyped the question of militarization of the Hambantota Port out of their own hidden agenda, Chinese Embassy said in a statement.
PM Wickremesinghe highlighted that Sri Lanka and himself have always been strongly supporting the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).
Sri Lanka attaches great importance to mega-projects cooperation with China, especially the projects of Hambantota Port and Industrial Park, Colombo Financial City. The Sri Lankan Government hopes to work with the Chinese side to accelerate the implementation of the ongoing projects and attract more Chinese investment in order to promote economic and social development, he said.
Responding to recent allegations of Chinese militarization at Hambantota Port, Ambassador Cheng pointed out that there is no any military purpose for China to conduct friendly and pragmatic cooperation with Sri Lanka.
China never interferes in Sri Lanka's internal affairs and is willing to work with the Sri Lankan side to push forward the latters economic and social development by promoting new type of international relations featuring mutual respect, fairness and justice, win-win cooperation, he said.

Piling commences at Ekroma Fortune site as city awaits this Grade A commercial space
	
Ekroma has awarded their Piling contract to D P Jayasinghe (Pvt.) Ltd for their Grade A office Space project, Ekroma Fortune. Located in Colombo 02, the piling commenced on an auspicious note a few weeks ago. In keeping with Ekromas credentials as a reliable and trusted real estate partner, the high quality of the construction is guaranteed, and as such the Baur BG 30, which is one of the largest piling machines in Sri Lanka, is being used in the piling. Ekroma Fortune is a new Grade A commercial space with high end specifications, located in the plush central business district at W A D Ramanayake Mawatha, approximately 40m down from Sir James Peires Mawatha. Ekroma Fortune was launched in the previous month at a high profile corporate event held at the Cinnamon Grand on the 16th of March.
Commenting on the project, Ekromas Managing Director, Mr. Onesh Subasinghe noted, Ekroma Fortune is entering the market at the most appropriate time, when a great shortage of Grade A commercial spaces in the Central Business District is most evident. Based on research conducted by JLL Sri Lanka, there is a shortage of 3.5 million sq.ft. in Grade A spaces and Ekroma Fortune looks to fill a small fraction of that need. By branding our company and projects, under the Ekroma brand name umbrella, we expect to derive significant brand recognition, which is long overdue. Ekroma Fortune would be a very unique investment opportunity, allowing investors to reap the benefits in terms of asset appreciation and monthly recurring income, playing in line with market dynamics for Grade A office space at present. There is a high demand for Grade A office space in Sri Lanka and the relative shortage in supply at present means premium rates can be charged on a per square-foot basis ensuring exceptionally high potential as the rental yield.
The uniqueness of this project is that Ekroma Fortune pioneers the concept of selling Lots starting at 1350 sq.ft., while allowing flexibility for full floor purchases at 8000sq.ft., which is not the norm in the industry. Ekroma Fortune is also ideal for Multinational Companies who wish to set-up their main corporate office within the Central Business District. Ekroma Fortune will spiral upwards 15-storeys high with a built up area of 153,000 sq.ft. which is customizable for early buyers.
The strategically selected central location ensures numerous bus routes, railway stations and the upcoming LRT System are within walking distance. The fact that many schools, hospitals, banks, hotels, embassies, supermarkets and places of worship are also within very close proximity further enhances its value. The countless places of entertainment and recreation that surrounds Ekroma Fortune bring together the perfect environment for work and play. Colombo 2 has established itself as the emerging commercial and entertainment hub, with numerous ongoing mega developments just meters away, and the upcoming Port City a mere 8 minutes away. The Office Space itself will feature all the possible amenities for a seamless experience for its occupants comprising of a self catering canteen, Ocean, City, Lake and Park Views with partial glass facade, high speed elevators, dedicated washrooms for even the smallest Lot, and almost 4 floors of parking.
The architects for Ekroma Fortune are the Thailand-Based Design Team 3, the Australia-based Structural Consultants  CSEC and EME Solutions, as Mechanical, Electrical and Plumbing consultants and Mr Selvaskandan as Project Management Consultant. Ekroma Fortune is scheduled for completion in November 2019.

Engaged in commercial property leasing, condominium development and strategic investments, Ekroma is a BOI-approved real estate and development company that is led by a dynamic team committed to maximize the value of their clients interests by giving them the opportunity to become a part of the emerging Central Business District, through investment in Ekroma Fortune.

PwCs Academy launches Advanced Management Programme for  C-suite business leaders
	
Having set its feet firmly in the Executive education industry in Sri Lanka, PwCs Academy has set its sights on launching a revolutionary Advanced Management programme for trend setting C-suite Business Leaders.

As a senior business leader, you are at the top of your game. You have ticked almost all the boxes in your checklist to be at the top, learnt enough frameworks and models throughout your career and applied them in your business. Hence, you may wonder what more there is to learn.It is, however, a messy complex world out there with a whole new level of disruption, technologies and dynamic trends and in this new world of business, your next hurdle would be to develop a better sense of judgement and be more cognisant of your strengths and weaknesses as a leader.

You need new lenses and perspectives to make sharper decisions, adapt better and most importantly be mindful as a leader.At the Advanced Management Programme, that is what we aim to achieve as we focus more on enhancing your judgement and less on models and frameworks.


Some of our latest research findings signify that CEOs and Business leaders tend to demonstrate specific behaviors that prove to be critical to their performance.

1. Decisiveness

High-performing CEOs stand out for being more decisive. They make decisions much quicker and portray a greater level of conviction regardless of ambiguity, incomplete information and uncharted territory domains.

2. Adaptiveness

Willingness to learn and the ability to adapt and operate in changing multi-cultural environments are critical to CEOs. They should not only have a high level of intellectual awareness; staying current on market trends but also have a personal sense of flexibility and adaptiveness.

3. Mindfulness

In a fast paced world, mindfulness enables you to clear your mind of clutter, focus on what is important and be emotionally intelligent.

Why is AMP so unique

Advanced Management Programme is not an ordinary executive education workshop.
This elite programme is designed by an award winning educator along with a cohort of world class faculty from leading business schools across the world.

Every once in a while, senior leaders need to get off the treadmill of work, decision-making and pressure, in order to step back and examine their leadership.

Without that, leaders are prone to developing what psychologists call cognitive depletion, a state in which we are no longer learning. The antidote to this is to enter a state of renewal, in which we are able to re-store ourselves, re-examine our mindsets, and re-define our goals and strategies in collaboration with others. This is what exactly what we try to achieve during AMP programme.

- Prof Sudhanshu Palsule- Course Director

Diverse world class faculty:In typical Advanced Management Programmes with reputed universities you are limited to a faculty from one university. But, with our flexible resource pool we have put together a diverse group of world class faculty teaching at worlds leading business schools across different continents.

The programme fosters an environment for deep and insightful self-reflection; facilitated by the diverse peer group and experienced faculty members who are approachable.

You will be learning with 25 exclusive top notch CEOs and business leaders from leading corporates in Sri Lanka and the region, sharing different perspectives of the same challenges which makes the programme a great peer learning experience.You will immerse in an integrated learning experience for three weeks to recreatea new and refined leadership path ahead.

Removing executive presidency not effective when 13A remains: Wimal
	
The abolishment of the executive presidency is not a good move when the 13th Amendment to the Constitution remains as it is, National Freedom Front (NFF) leader Wimal Weerawansa said.
In a press release, he said the 13th Amendment to the Constitution was brought to dilute the executive powers of the president by establishing provincial councils.
The proposal of the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) is contracted to challenge the unity of the country. The abolishment of the executive presidency will culminate in losing the powers of the president on the provincial councils. If the executive presidency is removed without abolishing the 13th amendment, it would drag the country towards anarchy, Weerawansa said.
While stating that his part is firmly opposed to the proposal, he invited the members of parliament who had already uttered that they would support the move to remove executive presidency, to ponder twice on their decision for the sake of the county. (Sheain Fernandopulle)

Former Minister S. B. Dissanayake said it would be easy to prevail upon the Central Committee of Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) to leave the unity government if President Maithripala Sirisena decided for it.
Mr. Dissanayake, along with 15 others, relinquished their ministerial responsibilities. He told Daily Mirror that all the 16 members would join the Opposition in Parliament next time.
He said this group was trying to prevail upon the entire Central Committee of the SLFP to take a common stand to leave the government. He said the President had a greater say in determining whether the party should proceed with the unity government or not.
The SLFP Central Committee comprises 53 members. Mr. Dissanayake said the President, as the head of the party, had the discretion to nominate 25 members.
If the President decides that the SLFP should leave, that will virtually be the decision of the Central Committee as a result, he said. Asked whether the party would seek the Opposition leader post in Parliament, he said no such decision had been taken at the moment.
First, we have to defect from the government, he said. (Kelum Bandara)

The mission of the three beleaguered parliamentarians, Dilan Perera, Chandima Weerakkody and Lakshman Perera representing the group of sixteen who voted in favour of the failed no confidence motion against the PM is kept a top secret - though some speculates this as an attempt to weaken the Pohottuwa led by Basil faction of the Joint Opposition by infiltrating it with another dozen of Maithri loyalists SLFP men from government.
Will they succeed in converting Sirisena who has already appointed a committee, headed by Special Assignments Minister Sarath Amunugama, prior to leaving for London, tasked with drafting a new agreement to continue the unity government. But deals and dramas take precedents over official pacts. The promoters of SLFP-Pohottuwa Alliance strategists believe they could isolate the SLFP/UPFA Secretarial faction who are in secret powwow with agents of Ranil, as well as, the Basil loyalists in the JO by uniting the two leaders; was it a master plan to field Sirisena as the Common Presidential Candidate to compete with UNP led Common Candidate at the end 2019 polls. The UNP thinks they can prioritise the development plans for the final two years, by signing a new deal and set out the strategy under which they would work jointly, without having to come across problems. For the past two and a half months everything in the country has come to a standstill. 
BUSY politicos who pay no respect to public
Sorry I was rude to you the other day, someone said.  Ive just been so busy.
A week ago, in the afternoon travelling from Bambalapitiya to Maradana, I had to spend nearly 50 to 60 minutes of valuable time stranded in heavy traffic. Schools being closed for holidays, usually, the maximum it would take is 10-15 minutes to cover the 3km stretch on the now widened road. But, on this instant it was quite unusual, avoiding Liptons circus and Ward place, which are now dedicated, consecrated, and hallowed grounds for the daily demonstrators from Higher Education and Health, I turned to Bullers Road to be confronted by a fleet of back-up black Defenders. The security men waving white gloved hands from every pot hole on the sides of the moving vehicles - followed by a flotilla of limousines and other luxury sedans driven by chauffeurs, carrying the crooks, robbers and others who aid and abet the former in the midst of deafening noise of sirens. They were coming from Reid Avenue and turning to Bullers road. The other road uses compelled stall and remain stationery for 15 to 20 minutes allowing them a smooth drive. They continue to travel at high speed with their security convoys inconveniencing other road users. 
We could proceed only a few metres. A second convoy of Defenders leaving Paget road and going towards Galle road forcing the road users to park their vehicles for another 10 minutes within half- an-hour to allow the busiest men in the world to have their way. I made a frantic but a vain effort to catch a glimpse of the two new Rs. 300 million bullet-proof luxury cars they imported a month ago with poor indirect tax-payers money. 

"Some flew to London to convince Boss about patching up"
Then I realized that our very busy legislators who have shamefully neglected their duties or obligations by the people who elected them to fulfil the pledges, do purely focus on personal agendas. Since February 10, the panicked government politicos have clustered into formal and informal groups, that frequently shuttle between Paget Road [re-named Mahagama Sekara Mw] the Presidents official residence, Temple Trees and Presidential Secretariat. This continuous to and fro movement was to meet the bosses, not to discuss the burning issues of the countrymen, but to plan, how best can they stick to their positions, survive, settle securely, firmly and comfortably in different levels of positions enjoying generous privileges and perquisites courtesy the agonized taxpayer, and plunder the public assets under the worst ever instability experienced in the post independent Sri Lanka.
Why the government does not carry a few more advertisements in the media, as they do with Health and Education to encourage more and more tax-payers to contribute by thanking them for all the luxuries these blood-suckers enjoy at their expense
Road clearance should be strictly restricted to vehicles engaged in emergency operations by Fire brigade, Ambulances, Police and armed forces during an emergency. 
Samuel Richardson once said, Those who have least to do are generally the most busy people in the world. Can they push the other road users to the edge of the road  What is the traffic law governing ordinary citizens right to use the roads without being harassed by authorities Isnt it amount to violation of fundamental rights of all the rest of the road users 
Reshuffle
President Sirisena has an opportunity to win the hearts and minds of people, if he decides to trim down the Jumbo cabinet and its ancillary parts called State and Deputies. The UNP rebellious group numbering around 26 would certainly have voted in favour of the NCM if Sirisena had not flawed the Joint Oppositions move to drive out the PM, at the final moment. 
We have a president from SLFP, elected on the back of UNP and minority votes - the result of a skilful strategy by former President Kumaratunga, Rajitha Senaratne, Patali Champika with the blessings of the late Ven. Maduluwave Sobitha-led National Movement for a Just Society (NMJS) and other Civil Society groups. 
The much talked-about cabinet reshuffle, probably more in the nature of a re-arrangement of hitherto highly unscientifically allocated subjects under ministries, promised to be completed soon after the NCM against the PM would become reality before the new sessions of Parliament scheduled to commence on May 8. Unscientific 46 ministries for three long years as admitted; 16 more than the constitutionally specified requirement and each costing the tax-payer Rs. 8.5 million a month should be pruned down to 30 avoiding unrealistic job allocations like Highways and Higher Education; Finance and Media; Foreign and Lotteries; Public Enterprises and part of Colombo-Kandy Highway [comic performers, to quote a few examples]. At the proposed reshuffle, if the yahapalanaya circus has an iota of hope of a victory at the next election they must get rid of tricksters, buffoons, court jesters and some of the veterans who are now in clown costumes who are dragging the country from the present chaotic state to an anarchy.

"46 ministries; 16 in excess; 3 years; each cost Rs. 8.5 Mn a month to taxpayer!"
Democracy is the best out of all bad forms of government for a participative polity. Our post independent history of 70 years is generally assumed as a democracy. What are the essential characteristics of a genuine democracy in the modern community 
Democracy is as described by Abraham Lincoln is a government of the people by the people for the people. It requires more than that each person has one vote; free and fair elections; when a majority government is elected, the rights and privileges of the minorities has to be respected. As per Universal Declaration of Human Rights, democracy implies that all citizens enjoy their, right to the freedom of opinion and expression, right to life, the right to assemble peacefully, and the right to education. Especially, if fundamental human rights of the minorities are not appreciated what succeeds would be not a genuine democracy but an autocracy of the majority.

## Title: The end of an era in Cuba - EDITORIAL

The end of an era in Cuba - EDITORIAL
	

n April 19, President Raul Castro stepped down from his position as President of Cuba. The National Assembly swore in Diaz-Canel, the 57-year-old vice president as President of Cuba. It marked a generational shift. For the first time since Marxist revolutionaries seized power in the island nation, the country will be led by a person who did not participate in the 1959 revolution and whose name is not Castro.
On January 1, 1959 Fidel Castro together with his brother Raul, Che Guevara (Ernesto Rafael Guevara de la Serna) and fellow revolutionaries with mass support from the Cuban people overthrew the regime of US-backed dictator Fulgencio Batista.
It was a time when illiteracy was Rampant in Cuba. Before the 1959 revolution, the country had a literacy rate as low as 60%. A time when most of the sugar industry (Cubas main export) was in US hands and foreigners owned 70% of the arable land on the island.
A study conducted by the University of Pittsburgh in 2014 titled Poverty in Paradise: Implications of Poverty in Cuba revealed over 50% of the population had no toilets. 85% had no running water. Over 25% of the labour force had no employment, 75% of rural housing consisted of huts made of palm fronds. 27% of the children in the urban areas did not attend school, 91% of Cubans did not have electricity. And in rural areas, there was one doctor per 2,000 population!
It was during this desperate backdrop the revolutionaries led by Castro seized power.
Today, after nearly 60 years since the revolution, it is almost impossible to visualise Cuba without a Castro at the helm.
But time and age take their toll, in 2008 Fidel Castro the architect of the Cuban revolution stepped down from the presidency, and two years later he died. 
Raul Castro was formally named Fidels successor in 2008 when Fidel Castro stepped down from the presidency. In the immediate aftermath of the revolution, Raul was appointed as head of the armed forces. He also served as the first vice president of the Council of the State and the Council of Ministers. 
In the decades that followed, he also served as Cubas defence minister and deputy Prime Minister. 
Che Guevara who played a key role in Castros seizure of power from Cuban dictator Batista in 1959, later served as Castros right-hand figure and Minister of Industry. 
In 1965, Che Guevara resigned from his ministerial post and subsequently moved into Bolivia to continue his battle against US imperialism in Latin America. On October 8, 1967, Che Guevara was injured in a battle against the US-backed Bolivian Army. He was murdered the following day, October 9, 1967. 
On April 19, Raul Castro stepped down from his position as President of Cuba. 
The National Assembly swore in Diaz-Canel, the 57-year old vice president as president, marking a generational shift and the first time a person who did not participate in the 1959 revolution will be leading that country. 
A new era has dawned in Cuba; vastly different from that of January 1, 1959, a time described by Arthur Miller as hopelessly corrupt, a Mafia playground, a bordello for Americans and other foreigners. 
Today Cuba boasts of one of the best education systems in the world. The country which had only one doctor per 2000 population, today sends volunteer doctors to different parts of the world. During the recent Ebola crisis which hit the African countries, Cuban doctors were in the forefront of combating the disease, which had reached near pandemic proportions. Cubas literacy rate is on par with the most developed countries in the world. Also homelessness was a nightmare of the past.
It is now up to the new generation of Cuban leaders to take forward the victories of the revolution.
