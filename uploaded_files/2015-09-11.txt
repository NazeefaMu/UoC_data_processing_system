Immigration Row: Lankan 'treated like an animal'
	
A Sri Lankan man who said he was arrested without explanation and held at a controversial centre has told Sky News he was "treated like an animal".
It comes as MPs call for radical changes to the system of immigration detention, as they debated the most far-reaching report yet into conditions for those facing deportation.
The House of Commons will address the findings, including evidence of sexual abuse of detainees and calls to end the detention of pregnant women.
Sky News spoke to a number of detainees who were released from the Yarl's Wood centre earlier this year.
The Sri Lankan man claimed he and his wife had entered the UK lawfully and were in ongoing contact with the Home Office about the status of their application when 12 officers detained them in an early morning raid.
The man who did not want to be named said: "We have never done anything wrong. I have never been to jail.
"I have no criminal record ? I can't explain how shocked we were.
"You are a criminal. That's how you feel, they treat you like an animal."
He said he and his pregnant wife were physically restrained by officers whilst at the centre.
"While my wife was on my lap, another two, three officers came and pulled my legs, and put me on the floor.
"Whilst we were on the floor, Serco officers were pulling her wrist. There's another officer pulling her from the shoulders.
"Then another pulling her from the tummy.
"What they did to her was so cruel. Nobody would do that to a pregnant woman in this world."
Serco said that a complaint surrounding the allegation of physical restraint had been made six months ago, and that they could not comment while it was being investigated.
Another former detainee said she had witnessed a woman being forced to crawl on her hands and knees to an office where a wheelchair was kept, because an officer refused to bring it to her room.
"The lady was crawling. I saw this.
"And after she had used the wheelchair, the officer said 'sorry, the chair has to stay in the office'.
"And on the way back, crawling," said the woman, from a South American country, who also did not want to be identified.
Serco denied there were insufficient resources for wheelchair uses and pointed out that long term users normally brought their own.
The security company also drew attention to a recent report by the prisons watchdog that found "staff treated inmates with respect" and found no evidence of a "widespread abusive or hostile culture amongst staff".
There has been renewed focus on the treatment of migrants in recent weeks.
The report by MPs was critical of the use of detention for vulnerable groups including refugees and trafficked women.
Detainees also spoke of the arbitrary nature of their detention, which came without warning and resulting in them being ultimately released back into the community.
"At Yarl?s Wood twice as many people are released back into the community as are removed which really raises the question, why are they detained in the first place?" said Emma Ginn, co-ordinator of charity Medical Justice.
"Immigration detention centres should be closed immediately.
"They are dangerous places, which cause serious harm to detainees."
The Home Office said it was working to improve standards at Yarl's Wood.
"We are committed to treating all detainees with dignity and respect," said a Home Office spokesperson.
"Detention and removal are essential parts of effective immigration controls, helping to ensure that those with no right to remain in the UK are returned to their home country if they will not leave voluntarily." (SKY News)

StanChart introduces two offers for cardholders
	
		 		 
		 
			
Standard Chartered (StanChart) has two great propositions for its credit cardholders. The first is an opportunity to convert any transaction into a 12-month plan at 0 percent interest and the second is an easy payment scheme up to 60 months at a range of merchant establishments. Once again Standard Chartered has sought truly value adding options for its cardholders in keeping with the economic and social trends of the market.
Standard Chartered Country Head Retail Clients Sanjay Wijemanne speaking of the two propositions commented, ?We are delighted to be able to continuously offer our clients some excellent propositions on our card. Getting things you truly want will become that much easier with the zero percent 12-month plan and the 60-month easy payment scheme.?
Standard Chartered?s ?Convert any transaction to a 12-month plan at 0 percent interest? allows the bank?s credit cardholders to avail themselves of payment flexibility when they purchase that ?special something?. Any transaction over Rs.50,000 may be converted into a 12-month plan at 0 percent interest with no handling fee.

Study finds toxic chemical in Kelani River
	
Studies conducted by the Centre for Environment and Nature Studies (CENS) have found high levels of toxic chemical Arsenic - nearly 0.004 kg / m3 (4.00 milligrams) per litre - in several areas in the Kelani River which is main source of drinking water for Colombo and its suburbs.
Environmentalist and Researcher Ravindra Kariyawasam of the CENS yesterday told the Daily Mirror that the highest level of arsenic was found in water samples obtained near the Ambatale Pumping Station.
He said the arsenic contamination of the Kelani River was caused due to the release of chemicals and effluent substances by over 150 industries located in the Biyagama Industrial Zone.
According to him, it takes about 20 years for even an atom of arsenic to get decomposed and the duration for the decomposition of nearly 0.004 kg / m3 arsenic found in Kelani River waters will take decades.
Due to the arsenic contagion, the natural water purifying process in the Kelani River had come to a standstill after micro species and trees which contributed in natural water purifying had been harmed continuously, Environmentalist Kariyawasam said.
He also said as far as he was concerned, the National Water Supply and Drainage Board was not having a method to chlorinate water contaminated by arsenic adding the situation might cause dangerous health problems for the consumers.
It is known that consuming high levels of arsenic could lead to serious medical complications such as skin, lungs, bladder and kidney cancers and other toxic health effects, including cardiovascular disease, neurological problems and developmental disorders.
He said that a series of studies was being carried out by the CENS since 2013 on the Kelani River, Po River in Italy and Satluj River in India.
The studies are being conducted by several qualified persons including Prof. Rajesh Goyal from Desh Bhagat University, India, Prof. D.F.Gerewal from India, German Scientist Freeza Michelle and Italian Scientist Ayarin Giagomppi. The CENS is a registered non-profitable institution run by private funds of the contributors, Mr. Kariyawasam said.
The full report of the findings of their studies will be handed over to the Environment Ministry and President Maithripala Sirisena with the completion of the studies in December, 2016.
He also said it was they who conducted the studies on the Rathupaswala water issue by taking water samples from the area. He said they did not get approval from any government authorities before they conducted studies since they already knew that they would not be allowed to carry out the studies. (Piyumi Fonseka)
