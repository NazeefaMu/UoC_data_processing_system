A year of high growth for Sanasa Development Bank
	
Sanasa Development Bank (SDB) posted an outstanding financial performance in 2015. The bank had a string year in terms of profitability, despite a challenging macroeconomic and regulatory environment.?
The SDB has recorded an impressive performance with the bank?s net profit before tax (PBT) surpassing the Rs.1 billion mark for the first time in the history. This is an exceptional 48 percent growth compared to the previous year and ended up with a post-tax profit of Rs.720 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2015. This growth was led by interest income coupled with the responsible interest expenses management. This healthy profitability performance was recorded under challenging market conditions and it demonstrates bank?s prudent management policies in managing the external forces.
During the year bank increased its interest income by 36.2 percent and interest expense increased by only 34.9 percent. This resulted in net interest income of the bank growing by 37.5 percent to Rs.3.3 billion, despite the banking sector margins continuing to drop in 2015. The net interest income contributed 93 percent to the total operating income during the year as against 86 percent contribution during 2014. The gross income, comprising of interest income, net fee and commission income, net gains/(losses) from financial assets held through fair value through profit and loss and other operating income recorded a 31 percent increase to reach Rs.6.8 billion for the year.
The operating expenses, which comprises personnel cost, depreciation and amortization and other operating expenses, increased by 30.6 percent and posts Rs.2.2 billion compared to the level of Rs.1.6 billion posted in the previous financial year. The primary drivers for this growth were personnel costs and office administration and establishment expenses accounting for 46 percent and 21 percent, respectively of the total operating expenses. The growth in personnel cost was driven largely by the increased head count, taken for future expansions as well as the periodic salary revision made in June 2015. These changes have been made amidst the expected aggressive business transformation across the bank, the benefits of which will accrue over the coming years.
Although the overall operating expenses reflected an increasing trend, it is noteworthy that the cost to income ratio was controlled at 60.4 percent from 62.6 percent in financial year 2014, demonstrating the bank?s shrewd management of expenses.
Impairment charge for loans and receivables of the bank was Rs.49.5 million and compares with a charge of Rs.204.3 million in 2014, a decrease of 75.7 percent over 2014. This substantial decline represents the bank?s sound judgment in assessing the fair value of the impaired loans, based on objective evidence of future recoveries and is in accordance with bank?s stringent risk management policies. The bank continuously makes improvement to the methodology adopted for the impairment computation process and there were no significant adjustments to the provisions as a result of such changes or improvements during the year.
Income tax including deferred tax expense was Rs.389.9 million for the 12 months ended December 31, 2015, reflecting 58 percent increase over the previous year corporate income tax expense. Thus, this accounted for a 35.1 percent effective tax rate, a rate above the corporate tax rate of 28 percent. This mainly resulted from the disallowed expenses such as value-added tax on financial services (VAT on FS) and Nation Building Tax (NBT). Due to the change in law applicable on VAT on FS, total VAT on FS charge for the year amounted to Rs.229.9 million revealing 40.9 percent increment over the previous year?s charge. Following to the aforesaid change leases became liable for VAT on FS and exempted from normal VAT with the removal of the exemption applied on banking and finance business, NBT expenses for the year accounted to Rs.43.7 million as against the Rs.27.1 million recorded in the previous year.
The bank recorded a growth of 48.6 percent in total assets as at the year-end over the corresponding year end. Accordingly, the total asset base reached to Rs.60 billion marks at the end of December 2015. This growth rate is well above the average industry growth rate which is reported at December 2015 as 15.9 percent.
Loans and receivables net of impairment allowance grew by 43 percent during the year under review to reach Rs.45.8 billion from Rs.32.1 billion as at December 2014. The term loan portfolio saw an impressive growth during the year, representing 49.1 percent compared Rs.25.9 billion in the previous year, whilst other loan products, which include leasing, hire purchase, pawning and cash margin loans, grew moderately during the year under review. However, the highlight of the year was the above industry average growth in loan portfolio, which is a strong affirmation of the bank?s commitment in nourishing and nurturing the country?s growing and demanding economy.
During the year, the bank?s total deposit base stood at Rs.43 billion, representing a growth of 42.2 percent as against the position of Rs.30 billion as at December 2014. The total deposit base contributed to 80.2 percent of the total funding base and 88.9 percent of the total balance sheet value.
Short-term bank borrowings stood at Rs.693.8 million as at December 31, 2015 compared to Rs.2.9 billion in December 31, 2014 whilst long-term loans increased to Rs.5.9 billion and the debenture outstanding balance increased by 100 percent to Rs.3.9 billion due to Rs.4 billion debenture issue effected in December 2015. These steps have taken mainly due to the measures taken to reduce maturity mismatch in assets and liabilities. Though there was no issue of new shares, shareholder funds increased by 12.8 percent during the year and ended up with Rs.5.2 billion as at December 2015. Increased profitability triggered a notable increase in retained earnings, even after paying dividends and transfers to reserves. During the year in compliance to the minimum capital requirement specified by Central Bank of Sri Lanka for licensed specialized banks, bank fulfils the minimum capital base requirement of Rs.5 billion.
The non-performing loan (NPL) ratio of the bank improved to 2.37 percent as at December 31, 2015 from 3.76 percent as at the previous year end. The bank has consistently maintained its NPL ratio well below the industry average and the improvement in the NPL ratio over the preceding year is a clear reflection of rigorous recovery efforts, the prudent credit policies adopted and the continuous and consistent credit evaluation process.
The bank has long benefitted from strong bedrock of capital which has provided much stimulus in achieving solid business growth and resilience. The Tier I capital base of the bank was Rs.5.22 billion, while the Tier I capital ratio was 12.30 percent. The total (Tier I and Tier II) capital base of the bank was Rs.5.41 billion as at December 31, 2015. The total capital adequacy ratio of the bank as at December 31, 2015 was 12.75 percent.
The bank?s statutory liquid asset ratio as at December 31, 2015 was at 22.16 percent, which is well above the statutory minimum ratio of 20 percent
Commenting on the success in 2015, SDB Chief Executive Officer Nimal C. Hapuarachchi stated, ?2015, being a year with several political and regulatory postures being changed, which had mixed impact on the financial services sector, achieving a phenomenal growth amidst such macroeconomic challenges, affirms SDB?s position as a resilient financial institution in the market.?
Chairperson Samadanie Kiriwandeniya states that SDB is now poised for a quantum leap through a transformation process leading to a significant revenue enhancement.

Don?t ever go to Saudi, Kuwait: Troubled housemaid pleads with SL women
	
The Sri Lankan housemaid who was repatriated to Sri Lanka after she was subjected to mistreatment for over 15 years by her employer in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia today pleaded with all the Sri Lankan women not to go to Saudi Arabia and Kuwait for employment as housemaids.
Murin Jasintha, a 46-year-old mother of three made this request at a media conference organized by the Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment Ministry (SLBFE).
Murin Jasintha, a 46-year-old mother of three and a resident of Muvunuwatawana, Chilaw was brought back to the country by the SLBFE a few days ago after she escaped from her employer where she was held without being paid for more than fifteen years, amidst physical harassment.
According to SLBFE reports, Murin went to Riyadh in 1999 at the age of 29, on an SLBFE registered working agreement.
However, after two months, the employer had refused to pay her monthly wages and not allowed her to get in touch with her family members. After the SLBFE officials intervened into the matter, the employer had agreed to pay her dues of Rs. 2.7 million in arrears for fifteen years.
?I was not paid, but I had to work for them continuously. When I gave letters to be sent to my children and husband, all of them were thrown out by my employer. One day when I was cleaning the house, I found some letters written by me to my children in a corner of the house. I felt very sad and helpless, but I stayed on ,? she said.
She also said that many changes had taken place in her family in Sri Lanka during the 15 years.
During the past 15 years when she was held in Riyadh, all of her three children have got married and they too are having children.
Further, she said her husband has started a new family with another woman.
?My husband is now living with another woman happily. I was not with them for 15 years. Anyway, I can be happy seeing them leading a happy life,? Murin said.
During the time she was accommodated at the Welfare Centre at the Sri Lankan Embassy in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, Murin said another Sri Lankan housemaid whose leg was broken after being harassed by her employer, was also brought there.
?I have only one request to all the Sri Lankan women. Please don?t ever think of going to Saudi and Kuwait for housemaid jobs. The mother of my employer troubled me a lot. I tolerated everything for the sake of my children,? Murin said.
?While doing cooking and washing at the employer?s house, I was compelled to lift two cans of water of 10 litres each for more than 25 times per day. I had to go up and down the stairs of a 15 storied building. I tolerated every hardship I had to face. Once I had to undergo a surgery after diagnosing an illness in my belly as a result of lifting such heavy weights, continuously. I got 49 stitches on my belly. My dedication was bigger than those problems,? she said.
She thanked Minister Thalatha Athukorala for making all the arrangements to bring her back safely to Sri Lanka and the Sri Lankan Embassy in Riyadh for the assistance.
A cheque worth Rs. 2.7 million for her monthly wages in arrears which was refused to be paid by her employer was offered by the Minister to Murin.
Another woman named S.I.Asiamma, 47 was also brought back to the country by the SLBFE.
Asiamma who is not having a good memory relating to the details of her work place and the employer, has also faced many hardships during her period of work. The SLBFE offered Rs.150, 000 from the SLBFE fund for migrant workers. (Piyumi Fonseka)
We can't challenge Saudi laws:Thalatha 
Responding a question raised by a journalist whether legal action could have been taken against a Saudi Arabian employer who has allegedly involved in an abduction of a Sri Lankan housemaid to intimidate her not to ask for a monthly wage, Foreign Employment Minister Thalatha Atukorala yesterday said the ministry cannot challenge such ?systems of strict laws? of Saudi Arabia.
?It is a great achievement that we could save her and bring her home. Legal action should not be taken, since we cannot fight with the strict laws of Saudi Arabia which is one of those big countries,? she said.

?Everybody lives happily till next blackout? quips energy expert
	
Both the current and past governments have swept post-blackout reports and recommendations which may have averted successive blackouts under the rug, which has resulted in an ongoing crisis situation, one of the country?s leading power and energy consultants said.
?The reports have gone to someone?s WPB. Everyone knows what WPB is; it?s the waste paper basket,? Dr. Tilak Siyambalapitiya said at a seminar on the electricity crisis themed ?Is there light at the end of the tunnel?, held at the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce yesterday.
None of the Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL) or Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) present at the discussion refuted the claims. Dr. Siyambalapitiya said that the report following the 2009 blackout, which outlined 37 recommendations and was written by him as part of the investigative committee, was never given any serious thought, or was published by the PUCSL.
?Everybody lives happily till the next blackout. The 2015 September blackout report was ignored till after the 2016 blackout, when people looked around, asking ?where is that 2015 report?,? Dr. Siyambalapitiya added.
CEB Chairman Anura Wijayapala, who outlined some challenges for the future, went on to say that he was confident that the state-run power generator will overcome any adversity. ?The PUCSL last week wrote to the CEB and the CEB said that all is well and that everything that can be done has been done. The PUCSL didn?t ask for any timeframe for action and the CEB didn?t give one,? Dr. Siyambalapitiya said.
However, it is interesting to note that when the CEB requested additional power requisition this week, the PUCSL shot down the proposal. Dr. Siyambalapitiya noted that in the US, when the last major blackout happened in 2003, there were seminars, research and public criticism for months, all of which is still available to the public today,
unlike in Sri Lanka, where no public discussion has taken place, in addition to the shortcomings in report publication. He noted that the current crisis is due to a mix of shortcomings in reliability, accountability and capacity. ?Up to a certain measure, it?s all of it. Is there light at the end of the tunnel? The indications are that there is no such light,? he said.
He said that there were no reliability indices or modern security analysis published, which are done in real time in other countries, where power generation company officials are fined for unreliable power supply and the proceeds are distributed among the customers. Dr. Siyambalapitiya said that Sri Lanka cannot keep comparing itself to India anymore either.
?In some states in India, they are achieving 24/7 power. Even in India, there?s only a 2 percent power outage. Now we shout and say India?s power outage is this, and we should do 10 times better,? he said.
He added that the CEB has not been accountable under the Electricity Act of 2009, not publishing reports on transmission performance standards, distribution performance standards or the grid codes for the past four years, except just once.
He noted that while there is no significant crisis in capacity yet, it will definitely come in 2018, since the commissioning of the Sampur Power Plant has been delayed till 2021.
Wijayapala agreed, saying that the power demand is expected to increase by 5 percent each year and only micro projects are expected to come online till 2021.
?I told the Prime Minister that the demand is expected to increase by 5 percent. He got a bit angry and said that we should cater to a 10 percent increase or more, because the government will be bringing in a lot of industries,? he said.
However, Dr. Siyambalapitiya said that the authorities should create comprehensive, holistic plans to satisfy the 5 percent increase before looking any further. (Chandeepa Wettasinghe)

Fury of a woman scorned!
	
This politico was a prominent purohita, when he first met this good looking girl, who was working as a librarian in an institution in his constituency.?
?He took an instant liking for her and got her appointed as a security guard at his Ministry located at a busy intersection in the city overlooking a park. ?And she enjoyed the privilege of meeting the purohita at any time of the day no holds barred.?
Now, shorn of power and authority, the politico who had obviously realised that time was no longer opportune for romantic escapades had gradually distanced himself from his girlfriend from the village. ?Angered by being thus scorned, the girl had begun making disparaging remarks about the former purohita. On hearing that the girl on whom he had had a huge a crush once, was making remarks calculated to defame him, the politico is said to have warned her that she would soon lose her job if she failed to bridle her tongue about their past affair.?

Govt. seeks business associate for SriLankan airline
	
Cabinet approval had been granted for converting the national carrier, SriLankan Air Lines, into a private- public partnership by October this year and the government is looking for a business partner for the airline, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe announced today.
?Cabinet had decided to defuse economic land mines without allowing them to explode and one of those mines is SriLankan Airlines,? the Prime Minister said.
? If we fail to do something about SriLankan which has incurred huge losses, the airline, the economy and the tourist industry will come down,? he told a media briefing, stating that the total expenditure of SriLankan Airlines have been US $ 3.5 billion while the total debt of the carrier is US $ 3.2 billion as of today. He said this is a huge burden which cannot be borne by the people.
The Prime Minister said the Cabinet had also decided to cancel the order which was made for four air crafts including the presidential suite. ?We have informed the manufacturing company to halt the production of these aircrafts,? he said.
While stating that the change would come by October this year, the Prime Minister said a total sum of US$ 202 million is needed to re-vamp both SriLankan and Mihin Air.
Further he said a new Bill will be introduced to Parliament, giving the House the power to control the entity.
Special Projects Minister Dr. Sarath Amunugama who elaborated on the plans with regard to SriLankan Airlines said the ideal arrangement will be to convert the national carrier into a public-private partnership having a 60 percent stake with the government and 40 percent with the private sector. ?Emirates were given 40 percent stake of the carrier in 1999 while the government owned 60 percent, but unfortunately the last government took over the 40 percent stake,? he said. Also it was assured that the logo of the airline will not be changed.
Responding to a question raised by journalists on Mihin Air, the Prime Minister said the government will deal with both airlines together, but he fell short of stating clearly, as to what would become of Mihin Lanka.

Move to implement increased VAT, illegal: Dinesh
	
Joint opposition Leader MP Dinesh Gunawardena today said, the move to implement the increased Value-Added Tax (VAT) from May 2 was illegal since Parliament was yet to ratify the increment.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe in Parliament in March said the government would increase the VAT to 15 percent. The government first announced the increment would be imposed from April 1 but postponed it to May 2.
?The Budget for this year was amended frequently and then the Prime Minister presented an interim budget with proposed tax increments. However, still, no documents were tabled in Parliament to seek its approval to impose the increased tax, despite the government?s assurance to do so,? MP Dinesh Gunawardena said.
He said since the tax proposals were not taken up for discussion and debate in Parliament, the entity which is responsible for taking fiscal decisions of the country, all tax increments would be illegal.
?Implementation of such taxes is a violation of the Constitution,? he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

NSC to take up Sampanthan incident
	
The National Security Council (NSC) would discuss a complaint lodged by Army Commander Lt. General Chrishanta De Silva on the alleged entrance to the Kilinochchi Army camp by Opposition TNA leader R. Sampanthan without permission and take action to prevent similar incidents in future, a Cabinet Minister said yesterday.
Skills Development and Vocational Training Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe told the media yesterday at the Information Department that the Government was extremely unhappy over what had happened.
He said a separate inquiry had been launched by the Police over the allegation on a complaint made by the Officer in Charge of the camp.
?This should not have happened. If and when a VIP wants to visit a camp of the Armed forces, he or she must get prior approval from the Head Quarters of the respective force and the base commander makes necessary arrangements on the advices of the Head Quarters,? he said.
?This is the procedure that is followed even when a Minister pays a visit to a camp of the Armed forces. This has not happened at this occasion and it is very unfortunate,? Minister Samarasinghe said.
He added the Government did not expect an irresponsible behaviour like this from a learned and experienced politician like Mr. Sampanthan.
?The Government had not restricted the access to Armed forces camps by any citizen but he or she must follow the procedures to do that. These kinds of incidents benefit only extremists. Two President, one foreign Prime Minister, dozens of Ministers and other politicians, intellectuals, academics and thousands innocent lives perished in the 26-year separatist war and therefore, the Government has a responsibility and duty to protect each and every citizen of the country and prevent a resurgence of separatist terrorism,? he said.
?That is why the armed forces like in any other country; follow certain security measures to let individuals into the camps of the armed forces. The terrorists had murdered innocent devotees in hundreds at temples, churches, kovils and mosques. The Government could not tell the armed forces to lower their guard,? Minister Samarasinghe said.
Commenting on the recent resolution passed in the Northern Provincial Council to the effect that a Federal System of Governance was necessary to resolve the North-East issue and re-merge the Northern and the Eastern Provinces as a single unit to be forwarded to the Constitutional Assembly to incorporate in the proposed Constitution, Minister Samarasinghe said the SLFP was against Federalism and the re-merger of the North-East.
?The SLFP never accepted the Federal system of Governance as a sustainable political solution to the North-East problem. Legally, North-East cannot be re-merged as there is a clear Supreme Court ruling on that issue. The SLFP cannot violate the Constitution by supporting the re-merger,? Minister Samarasinghe said.
?Even the 13th Amendment to the Constitution that introduced Provincial Council system in 1987, under power devolution was a narrow split decision with five of the judges of the Supreme Court of the day agreeing and four disagreeing. Besides, a referendum, as required by the Supreme Court, never held in the Northeast to decide on the future of the merger of the two provinces, he pointed out.
Responding to a journalist on certain remarks allegedly made by Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Jeyaram Jayalalithaa, that Sri Lankan refugees living in South India would be given dual citizenship, Minister Samarasinghe said Jayalalithaa must not bother about the Sri Lankan citizenship of them because they were already Sri Lankans.
?If she wants Indian citizenship for them she must get it sorted out with New Delhi,? he said. (Sandun A Jayasekera)

Our portfolio well aligned with key growth sectors: JKH Chairman
	
Today, Mirror Business in partnership with the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) kicks off an interview series, featuring the Chairmen of the CSE S&P SL20 companies. Following are the excerpts of an interview with John Keells Holdings PLC (JKH) Chairman Susantha Rathnayake, where he shares his insights about the JKH?s future, industries the group is in and the country?s economic potential.?
Q: What are the key milestones achieved in the last financial year??
The consolidated PBT in the last Financial Year, being 2014/2015, was Rs.19.08 billion, a growth of 25 percent over 2013/14.
The consolidated PBT for the nine month period ended 31 December 2015 is Rs.13.13 billion, a 9 per cent increase against the corresponding period of the previousfinancial year. The construction of the Rs.820 million integrated resort, ?Cinnamon Life? (?Waterfront?), continues.The required debt funding for ?Cinnamon Life? was concluded through a syndicated project development facility in June 2015. ?In September 2015, we acquired a controlling stake in Rajawella Holdings (Private) Limited, which owns a 500 acre land in Digana with an 18-hole Donald Steel designed Golf Course. This investment will complement the Group?s leisure and property portfolios. The construction of the premium residential development, ?7th Sense? on Gregory?s Road, was completed in December 2015.
In June 2015, JKH completed the subdivision of its ordinaryshares, whereby seven shares were subdivided into eightshares. JKH also completed the conversion of the 2015 Warrant, where almost the entirety of warrants were exercised and accepted.?
?
Q: What are the growth prospects prevalent in the industries you operate in?
Our portfolio is well aligned with the key growth sectors of the economy and this augurs well for the Group. The acceleration of the pace of consumption, shift in consumption patterns and increasing per capita incomebenefitted the Consumer Foods and Retail businesses in the last year.Opportunities to further capitalise on these aspects combined with the significant room for higher per capita penetration indicates longer term growth prospects for many of our consumer focused industry groupssuch as Financial Services and Consumer Foods and Retail.?
The tourism industry is expected to maintain its growth momentum and our leisure portfolio is well positioned to capture this growth under the umbrella of our ?Cinnamon? brand.Further, we believe thatin the medium to long term,the opportunity ofthe Meetings, Incentives, Conferences and Exhibitions (MICE) market, particularly from India, will enable us to attract the high spending segment of tourists which Sri Lanka has hitherto been unable to satisfy.
Given the strategic location of the country and the inherent advantage Sri Lanka possesses as a maritime hub,we also expect the logistics, ports and bunkering businesses to benefit from the increase in traffic with furtherinfrastructure expected to support this traffic.?
?
Q: How do you intend to capitalize on these growth opportunities??
The significant strength of the JKH balance sheet coupled with its ability to leverage substantially, if required, has been one of the key factors that have allowed JKH to undertake some landmark investments in the past. The Group is fortunate to be in a similar position at this juncture where significant resources are at its disposal which will enable the Group to benefit from the numerous opportunities presented to us at this moment.
Our focus has been on establishing an umbrella brand, ?Cinnamon?, across our leisure portfolio, to capitalise on the growth potential in tourism. We believe that ?Cinnamon? positions us to capture the higher spending customers through the differentiated products and services the brand promises.In addition, this initiative aims to streamline all processes, policies and standards within the Leisure group in contributing to a more effective management of room inventory, yield management, enhanced guest experiences and in deriving synergies on common costs which lend themselves to centralisation.?
As stated earlier, we believe that ?Cinnamon Life? is uniquely placed to cater towards the emerging requirements ofthe contemporary tourist and the increasing MICE traffic, positioning Colombo as a hub for business and leisure travel.
Since consumers nowadays are continuously evolving and more informed, they are always on the lookout to better their lifestyle, be it a healthier option, shift to modern trade or convenience. Given this, our Consumer Foods and Retail businesses will continuously focus on expanding our portfolio, remaining relevant and widening our footprint by staying ahead of the market and understanding consumer needs, as we have done in the past.
Opportunities in the Transportationbusiness will continue to be evaluated, particularly considering any opportunities based on the Government?s interests in private-public partnerships, such as with the East Container Terminal of the Port of Colombo.?
?
Q: In your opinion, what challenges do you anticipate in the industries that you operate in??
Whilst we recognize that significant growth opportunities are present in the tourism industry, our primary concerns relate to the lack of regulation and the coordination of effort. The attractions of tourists with a high spend and the right stay is a key challenge in promoting this industry. The unregulated proliferation of rooms in the informal sector is impacting occupancies and average room rates. Whilst the emergence of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises in tourism is a good thing, we are of the view that they have to operate in line with certain minimum standards if the industry is to thrive.
Given the slowdown in global trade and decline in commodity prices, shipping, bunkering and ports will be impacted throughout the world and this could be a challenge for Sri Lanka in the near term.?
The management of human resources and retention of talent will be a focal point for many industries in Sri Lanka, with some of our businesses being no exception. ?Attracting the right skills, improving productivity and retaining this vital stakeholder are challenges for the Group, especiallyinthe retail, hospitality and financial servicesbusinesses.Outdated labour laws which impede the productivity, flexibility and the agility of organizations in an ever-changing, fast-paced dynamic world are also concerns.
?
Q: What is your assessment on the readiness of your organization to meet these challenges??
We constantly re-align, reposition and re-invent ourselves in pursuing the growth sectors of the time.Maintaining flexible cost structures is a key objective for us in successfullyadaptingto these challenges within a dynamic environment.
Sustainability practices in line with international standards, employee branding, engraining Group values and culture in the DNA of employees and continuously striving towards a performance driven culture have contributed to managing the previously mentioned challenges pertaining to the human resource front.
?
Q: What efforts and initiatives are you taking to drive shareholder value??
Over the years, our corporate agility, resilience and business adaptability have driven a well-diversified portfolio. The ability to quickly cater to emerging needs has been a key factor in propelling shareholder value. When allocating funds for various investments, our well proven project evaluation model strives to strike a balance between optimizing immediate portfolio returns against the returns in the future.We are delighted to state that we are currently in the process of evaluating an exciting pipeline of projects which we believe will further propel the growth momentum of the Group.
?
Q: How has listing on the CSE transformed your company?
JKH listed on the Colombo Stock Exchange in 1986 and is currently one of the largest listed companies in Sri Lanka.Greater access to capital through diverse sources, both international and foreign, and shareholder centric decisions have enabled the company to sustain a good performance over a long period of time and this stance seems appropriate for JKH when looking ahead.?
The strength of the balance sheet, as I stated previously, and the ability to raise funds has been the cornerstone of the Group. These have enabled landmark investments such as the acquisition of Ceylon Cold StoresPLC (Whittalls), Asian Hotels and Properties PLC, and the investments in South Asia Gateway Terminal and ?Cinnamon Life?, to name a few.
While being a listed company has provided liquidity to shareholders of the company, it also has paved the way for JKH to introduce an Employee Share Option (ESOP) scheme. This ESOP scheme has ensured better alignmentof management with the interests of shareholders and have contributed to our efforts in staff retention and attraction.

It is also the only Sri Lankan finance company to have two international ratings. PLC has been included in the S&P Sri Lanka Index of the CSE since December 2014 where other constituents are the 20 largest blue-chip companies chosen from the all stocks listed on the CSE. The company was also ranked 17th amongst ?Top 25? listed companies of the CSE.?

?The brand?s vast distribution channels enabled us to reach out and serve a wider customer base across the island. The brand intends to expand its presence to the North and East to further boost its wide reach in the interior of Sri Lanka. More and more customers are expecting service at their doorstep and we are making sure we can offer this service,? Kumarage stated.
??PLC Online? is one such initiative to cater to customer needs. The field force is equipped with palm top devices to take financial inclusive transactions to the doorstep of customers, so that they do not have to visit branches,? he added.
