Ball of snot dripping during live telecast
	
As the race for the presidential nominations hots up, reporters are also having to up their game.
It means they have to ignore distractions and anything that could put them off on live TV.
And for Hallie Jackson, not even a ball of snot could stop her reporting.
The NBC correspondent was on a live feed from Tennessee talking about Chris Christie backing Donald Trump when the booger started to come down from her nostril.
She didn't let it faze her, and she carried on speaking to the camera until it dropped to the floor.
Jackson didn't say if she knew it was there during her segment, but she saw the funnier side of it just hours later.
She tweeted a picture of her online shopping cart - $53 worth of tissues and a book called 'Surviving Your Season of Shame'.
The clip of her awkward moment has since gone viral. (dailymail)

Jayasekara and was followed by an enlightening panel discussion, moderated by KPMG Principal Tax and Regulatory Suresh R.I. Perera. The panellists joining the discussion representing the Inland Revenue Department were Kalyani Dahanayake, J.P.D.R. Jayasekara and Commissioner Upul Jayawardena.

RAMIS was introduced in Budget 2014 and the Inland Revenue Department, with the assistance of the Singaporean Institution, has successfully done the initial implementation. Jayasekara mentioned that there are three approaches of communicating and obtaining information from the Inland Revenue Department on RAMIS.
A tax payer can login to the E-Services on the Inland Revenue website, call a service agent at the call centre and/or directly approach the tax payer information services at the Inland Revenue Department.

Courts issues stern warning to Hirunika
	
The three-member trial-at-bar bench hearing the case involving the Bharatha Lakshman killing, today issued a stern warning to parliamentarian Hirunika Premachandra over her irresponsible conduct in courts, saying she would be charged for contempt of court if she tarnished the dignity of the court.
The bench made this remark after Ms. Premachandra entered the court chamber midway while the hearing was in progress, ignoring the practice of making the traditional gesture when entering courts halfway. The bench headed by Justices Shiran Gunaratne also included Padmini Ranawaka Gunathilaka and M. K. B. S. Moraes.
CID Inspector Merrill Ranjan was giving evidence with regard to the case when Ms. Premachandra had walked in by opening the closed door.
Though Ms. Premachandra said she made the traditional greeting when entering the court chamber, the bench said they were watchful of all her movements since she entered and warned her to protect the dignity of the court.

CV asks Indian help for federal solution
	
India might ?intervene? again in Sri Lanka to help the Tamil minority and provide a federal solution to the ethnic reconciliation problem, a media report quoted Northern Province Chief Minister C. V. Wigneswaran as saying.
The BBC?s Sinhala service has reported that the Chief Minister made the remarks in Jaffna on Sunday while addressing a group of academics who had returned to the north after their educational pursuits in India.
Mr. Wignewswaran said he believed that India would intervene again in Sri Lanka as they had come to the assistance of the Tamils in politically sensitive situations in the past as well, referring to the Indo?Lanka Peace Accord of 1987.
According to the Hindu which picked up the media report, he has said as a direct result of that intervention two provincial councils were created in the north and east.
?The Tamils are currently caught in political turbulence once again since the end of the military campaign of the LTTE in 2009 and a federal solution is best to address the issue,? the Chief Minister was quoted as saying by the BBC.

Dawood calls for lasting solution for adversity faced by Muslims
	
Sri Lanka Muslim Congress (SLMC) Chairman Basheer Segu Dawood said today that Muslim political leaders should provide a permanent and a lasting solution for the discrimination and adversity faced by the community.
He also proposed that a mechanism has to be created for the community?s welfare, rather than looking for mercy from political leaders.
Issuing a statement with regard to a recent discussion in Kattankudy, he said the discussion was about a separate Muslim Provincial Unit (Muslim Alahu in Tamil) and not a Muslim separate state.
?This probably was translated into other languages as a separate Muslim state. I do not perceive this as a deliberate act but a mistake in the translation. However, the Tamil media has carried the news in the way I meant it,? he said.
He said whenever a call is made to address Muslim aspirations, it was referred to as ?Jihad? which has never been an entity in Sri Lanka.
?It is said it is a fashion to portray the community as a violent race. So, as Muslim leaders we should hope that future generations will come forward to win their right,? he said.
Speaking on the Tamil issue, he said as the Tamil community is demanding justice for the injustice caused during the end times of the war, the Muslim community is also demanding justice for loss of lives and possessions inflicted in the 1900s. (Piyumi Fonseka)

Environmentalists oppose gift of elephant to NZ
	
Environmentalists yesterday opposed the government?s announcement to gift an elephant calf to New Zealand during recently concluded visit of New Zealand Prime Minister John Key.
They urged the government to follow India and stop the practice of gifting animals to foreign countries as it is cruel.
Environmental lawyer Jagath Gunawardana, speaking to the Daily Mirror said gifting living creatures like elephants on the whim of politicians should be stopped soon.
He said after the she-elephant, aged 5 is removed from its family at this age would result the animal to undergo a biologically dead position since it should be adapted in a familiar place where the animal is fed, watered and treated well.
Slamming the government?s decision to deport the animal as a ?diplomatic gift? to the New Zealand, Mr. Gunawardana said this latest move was just one of incidents that took place for years amidst environmentalists? opposition.
President of the Species Conservation Centre, Pubudu Weeraratne said these kinds of acts will reduce Sri Lanka's elephant population that is now under threat.
?The youngster would be removed only when it could stand alone. According to sources, this animal is just five years of age. According to normal procedure, a she-elephant should adapt with the parents throughout its lifetime and a he-elephant normally live with parents until 10 years of age. Moreover, this animal will be adapted in a private zoo in New Zealand. This is not a good decision. If they want to give gifts to counterparts, they should have to choose something that is not a living creature. Gifting elephants could also impact on the tourism industry in the long term. Tourists come to Sri Lanka to watch elephants. After we send them to foreign countries, the number of tourists could fall,? he said.
He said some environmentalists including himself expect to speak to President Maithripala Sirisena who is also the Minister of Mahaweli Development & Environment, in this regard.
Meanwhile, New Zealand Herald had opened a debate for Kiwis to comment on whether their country should accept the baby elephant gifted by Sri Lanka. An equal number of ?yes? and ?no? comments plus some undecided on accepting the gift appeared in the debate.
However, the Herald later reported that the Auckland Zoo had confirmed the baby elephant gifted to New Zealand in Sri Lanka. The Zoo has said it was delighted to welcome a second elephant from Pinnawala Elephant Orphanage.
?Five-year-old Nandi will be the final elephant to come from the orphanage and will increase Auckland Zoo's growing elephant family to three with its elephants Burma and Anjalee,? it reported. (Piyumi Fonseka)

Janashakthi reports Rs.1.02bn PBT for FY15
	
Janashakthi Insurance PLC (Janashakthi) reported a consolidated gross written premium (GWP) of Rs.10.664 billion for the year ended December 31, 2015, a growth of approximately 19 percent over the same period in 2014, the company said in a press release.
The insurer posted a profit before tax (PBT) of Rs.1.02 billion for the period under review. The company?s life insurance business recorded a GWP of Rs.2.550 billion.
This yearon- year (YoY) growth of close to 18 percent was a result of changes made to the life sale and distribution structure and the basis for commission payments during FY2014. The non-life business achieved a GWP of Rs.8.113billion, a YoY increase of over 19 percent.
Propelled largely by the growth witnessed in its motor insurance business, this further validates Janashakthi?s position as the insurer of choice amongst motorists. Honouring its commitment to policyholders, Janashakthi disbursed in excess of Rs.5 billion as claims through the year. The company?s balance sheet grew by almost 52 percent in FY2015 to Rs.31.694 billion, with investments of Rs.22.346 billion accounting for 71 percent of assets.
A reflection of its strong fundamentals and commitment to stakeholders, Janashakthi?s Life Fund grew by about 20 percent to Rs.8.782 billion during this period. In a bid to strengthen its position in the general insurance segment, Janashakthi acquired a 100 percent stake in AIA General Insurance Lanka Limited in October 2015.
Having closed the financial aspects of the Rs.3.2 billion acquisition on October 23, 2015, Janashakthi completed its amalgamation with Janashakthi General Insurance Limited on January 29, 2016. ?2015 has indeed been a momentous year for us at Janashakthi. Both life and nonlife businesses posted outstanding top line growth while honouring our commitment to policyholders.
The year also saw us further consolidate our position in the general insurance segment with the acquisition of AIA General Insurance Lanka Limited. With the amalgamation now complete, we are working on unveiling a host of innovative insurance solutions.
With the promise of exciting times ahead, we look forward to delivering greater value to all stakeholders as we advance towards market leadership,? said Janashakthi Insurance PLC Ma n a g i n g D i r e c t o r Prakash Schaffter. Janashakthi had also assigned the leasehold rights of its land on Staple Street, Colombo 2 to Sanken Construction Ltd, for Rs.1.93 billion.
Having received a 50 percent advance of Rs.965 million on December 23, 2015, the transaction, which is expected to be completed by March 25, 2016, it will generate Rs.940 million in profits for the company. The Janashakthi Insurance PLC board of directors comprises Non?Exe cut ive Cha i rman W.T. Ellawala, Non?Executive Deputy Chairman Hu s e i n Esufally, Managing Director Prakash Schaffter, Executive D i r e c t o r / C h i e f E x e c u t i v e Officer Jude Fernando, Non- Executive Independent Director L.C.R. de C.

Sanasa FY15 net profit up 15%
	
Licensed commercial bank, Sanasa Development Bank PLC (SDB), saw its December quarter net profits falling by 21 percent to Rs.149 million over the corresponding period last year due to a significant increase in operating expenses and the fall in non-fund-based incomes, the interim results showed.
The core-banking operations, despite doing well, came under pressure during the latter part of the year as the cost of funds rose higher than the fund incomes as the interest expenses rose by as much as 60 percent yearon- year (YoY) while the interest income rose by only 37 percent YoY. The net interest income for the quarter rose 19 percent YoY to Rs.878.5 million.
The earnings per share for the quarter fell to Rs.3.70 from Rs.7.52 a year ago. The SDB share closed at Rs.140.20 at last week?s close falling 40 cents or 0.28 percent. The operating expenses rose staggering Rs.198.2 million to Rs.716.1 million from a year ago, of which the personnel expenses rose by Rs.131 million or 56 percent YoY, partly due to the 208 new employees who came on board and perhaps also due to the year-end bonuses and other incentives.
The non-fund incomes fell sharply by Rs.136 million to just Rs.39.2 million as the net fee and commission declined by two thirds to Rs.26 million. Meanwhile, the bank made only a paltry gain of Rs.3.1 million from its short-term investments ? shares and/or treasury bills ? against a gain of Rs.18.6 million made a year ago. This is perhaps due to the mark-tomarket losses made on its share investments due to the poor performance in the stock market and/or rise in interest rates of the government securities.
The other operating incomes (net) fell 88 percent YoY to Rs.10.4 million. Impairments demonstrated a reversal of Rs.59.6 million against an impairment charge of Rs.85.3 million a year ago. For the year ended December 31, 2015, the bank posted a net profit of Rs.729 million, up 45 percent, amid above average growth in the loans and advances, higher margins and lower impairments. The earnings per share rose to Rs.18.69 from Rs.13.49.The return on equity rose to 14.55 percent from 12.01 percent a year ago.
The net interest income rose by 38 percent to Rs.3.37 billion while the net interest margin rose to 7.13 percent from 6.97 percent. The bank expanded its loans and receivables by 43 percent or Rs.13.7 billion to Rs.45.8 billion but the asset quality improved as the gross non-performing loan ratio declined to 2.37 percent from 3.76 percent a year ago.
The growth in loans was largely matched by the growth in deposits which grew by 42 percent or Rs.12.8 billion to Rs.43 billion. In December 2015, the bank issued a Rs.4 billion debenture and other borrowings also rose by Rs.2 billion to Rs.6.6 billion. Both Tier I and tier II capital adequacy ratios weakened to 10.61 percent and 11.05 percent from 14.89 percent and 15.33 percent, respectively due to the aggressive growth in advances. But they remain adequately elevated above the minimum 5 percent and 10 percent requirements. As of December 31, 2015, the high-net-worth investor, Dr. T. Senthilverl held a 10.44 percent stake in the bank being the single largest shareholder.

Sri Lanka steps into inclusive cashless payment eco-system with PAYable
	
A revolutionary new model in cashless mobile payments is set to create a small and medium enterprise (SME)-led transformation in the Sri Lankan economy with the launch of PAYable, a free Bluetooth card reader and mobile phone app.
Developed by CBA Solutions (Pvt.) Ltd, PAYable is led by two pioneering Sri Lankan technology entrepreneurs who believe that breaking barriers for individual, micro and SMEs will dramatically increase the earning power of this sector while unleashing a new wave of economic activity into the Sri Lankan market. ?Inclusive growth is the driving force behind PAYable.
Imagine merchants of any size gaining the power to accept card payments for their businesses but without the deterring costs that they would typically face, this could be a real game changer for them,? explained CBA SolutionsCo-Founder and Chief Executive Officer Sujith Subasinghe. A Sri Lankan tech entrepreneur, who started his first business while attending the University of Victoria in British Columbia, Canada, Subasinghe developed experience building IT-based solutions for a range of industries spanning the music, entertainment, advertising and healthcare businesses before setting up a software development team with fellow Sri Lankan, Yohan Wijesiriwardane, who now serves as CBA Solutions? Chief Operating Officer. Subsequently, collaborating with Ceylon Business Appliances ? a trusted supplier and service provider of office appliances for over 45 years ? the duo was keen to crack a solution to the financial exclusion of SMEs.
It is currently estimated that over 50 percent of Sri Lankan gross domestic product (GDP) is generated by SMEs, which account for approximately 80 percent of all businesses in the country, and provide employment for as much as 35 percent of the country?s total labour force. Particularly when evaluated in combination with micro and individual enterprises, the fact that such businesses are limited solely to cash transactions has been a long-standing competitive disadvantage. In that context, the creation of a costeffective card acceptance solution that is capable of removing all cost barriers for individual, micro and SMEs to enter the cashless payment space holds immense potential for merchants of all sizes and the Sri Lankan economy at large. In addition, it offers convenience to customers, helping to move Sri Lanka closer to a cashless economy.
PAYable will be distributed as a free mobile app paired with a free Bluetooth Card reader that will enable vendors to accept VISA and MasterCard credit and debit card payments.
A highly reliable, durable and compact card reader, PAYable can be paired with any smartphone or tablet to effectively convert a standard Android or iOS device into a secure, flexible and easy to use mobile point-of-sales (POS) solution. Designed using best in class security protocols, such as the PCI DSS Guidelines ? a global security standard developed by VISA, MasterCard and other major card providers ? PAYable is built within a secure network that is regularly monitored and tested in order to maintain the strictest standards of information security and protection of cardholder data.
The solution has already garnered significant interest among Sri Lanka?s banking sector with several major Sri Lankan banks having already entered into discussions with regard to the integration of PAYable as a value-added service. PAYable hit the market in February 2016 with devices being introduced to potential merchants, coupled with a communications campaign to reach merchants as well as customers.

Strange animal species found in Sinharaja
	
A new animal species was discovered in the Sinharaja Forest Reserve this evening by Wildlife officials, the Sustainable Development and Wildlife Ministry said.
The officials had rushed to scene following information received around 4 pm about a strange kind of animal in the forest.
The animal was found after an extensive search in the Panapola Kosgulana area between Weddagala and Pothupitiya in the Sinharaja forest reservation.
Wildlife officials informed the department that the animal could not be identified and it appeared to look like a golden mongoose or polecat. But it was different from other polecat species, because it had no tail and its fur was yellow and brown.
The forest department is seeking assistance from the villagers or individuals who have seen this animal. This animal weighing around 3.3 kgs is 60 centimeters long. The officials suspect that the animal may not have a tail as it was lost at a younger age. the height of the animal, including its arms span, is about 39.1 centimeters.
The department said necessary genetic experiments were to be carried out to identify this animal.

The Criminal Investigation Department (CID) has recorded statements from the former Officers-In-Charge of the Kirulapona and Narahenpita Police and another police officer, all of whom had conducted the preliminary investigation into the death of rugby player Wasim Thajudeen.
The CID, in a report submitted to Court, said the statements from these officers were recorded at the CID office recently.
Statements from a former Narahenpita OIC, Chief Inspector Dalian Kamal Nishantha Perera, OIC (Crimes), IP Sumith Perera and a former Kirulapona OIC, Chief Inspector Aruna Samantha Chandrapala had been recorded.
Court ordered the CID, on December 10 last year, to conduct the investigation properly and record statements from the former officers of the Narahenpita Police.
The judge gave this order after considering the request of the attorney representing the aggrieved party to punish the officers, if any, under sections 198 and 199 of the penal code who had acted to conceal the truth during the judicial procedure. (Nirangi Abeywickrema)
