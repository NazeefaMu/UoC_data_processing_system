Million dollar theft: Travel ban on 6 SL directors
	
Colombo Chief Magistrate Gihan Pilapitiya today imposed a travel ban on six directors of Shalika Foundation, Sri Lanka in connection with the theft of $ 81 million from Bangladesh Bank's accounts.
Accordingly, the Magistrate ordered the Immigration and Emigration Controller not to allow company directors including H.G.Shalika Perera, Miyurin Ranasinghe, Pradeep Rohitha, Shantha Nalaka Walakuluarachchi, Sanjeewa Tissa Bandara, and Shirani Dhammika Fernando to leave the country.
The Magistrate issued this order after the CID informed full details about the international heist. The CID launched an investigation following a complaint by the Central Bank.
Four requests to transfer a total of about $81 million to the Philippines went through, but a fifth, for $20 million, to a Sri Lankan non-profit organisation was held up because the hackers misspelled the name of the NGO, Shalika Foundation.
Hackers misspelled "foundation" in the NGO's name as "fandation", prompting a routing bank, Deutsche Bank, to seek clarification from the Bangladesh central bank, which stopped the transaction, one of the officials said.
Meanwhile, Bangladeshi investigators will travel to Sri Lanka, Philippines and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to investigate the theft of $ 81 million from its accounts, a news report on AFP said.
Hackers stole the money from the Bangladesh Bank's account with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York on February 5 and managed to transfer it electronically to accounts in the Philippines.
The FBI has agreed to help Bangladesh investigate the theft from the nation's foreign reserves, authorities said Sunday, days after the finance minister accused central bank officials of complicity in the heist. (Nirangi Abeywickreme)

School admission conundrum may compel docs to leave country
	
The Government Medical Officer?s Association (GMOA) today warned that doctors would be compelled to leave the country because of the difficulties they undergo when looking for schools for their children.
It said the country would lose its doctors if they go overseas because of the Government?s failure to admit their children to national schools.
GMOA Secretary Dr. Nalinda Herath told a news conference that more than 200 children had been deprived of admission to State-run schools this year.
He said some doctors are transferred every four years according to the special transfer scheme and some doctors go for overseas training, and hence find it difficult to show five-years of permanent residence to get national school admission for their children.
When inquired by Daily Mirror, Education Ministry Secretary W.M. Bandusena said the ministry had already reached an agreement with the doctors of the GMOA and specialists with regard to this matter. (Piyumi Fonseka)

Bangladeshi investigators to visit SL to probe $ 81mn theft
	
Bangladeshi investigators will travel to Sri Lanka, Philippines and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to investigate the theft of $ 81 million from its accounts, a news report on AFP said.
Hackers stole the money from the Bangladesh Bank's account with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York on February 5 and managed to transfer it electronically to accounts in the Philippines.
The FBI has agreed to help Bangladesh investigate the theft from the nation's foreign reserves, authorities said Sunday, days after the finance minister accused central bank officials of complicity in the heist.
A FBI official in Dhaka met with representatives from Bangladesh's Criminal Investigation Department and offered to assist with the investigation into the spectacular cross-country theft.
"Both the FBI and the CID have agreed to work together since it's a transnational organised crime and transnational criminal networks are involved," Md. Saiful Alam, deputy inspector general of CID, told AFP.
There was no immediate comment from the FBI.
The audacious cyber-theft has embarrassed the government, triggered outrage in the impoverished country and raised alarm over the security of the Bangladesh's foreign exchange reserves of over $27 billion.
The central bank governor, his two deputies and the country's top banking bureaucrat lost their jobs following the theft and the government has been scrambling to contain the damage from the spiralling scandal.
Police said Bangladeshi investigators were planning to travel to the Philippines, Sri Lanka and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York as part of the transnational probe into the heist.
However, investigators say local hackers were likely involved in the theft.
"We suspect some local people are involved in the crime. The names of local development projects were used in the payment advices sent to the Federal Reserve Bank," Alam said.
"This has raised our suspicion that there could be some local links."
In a damning interview published on Friday, the country's Finance Minister A.M.A Muhith told the Bengali-language daily Prothom Alo that Bangladesh Bank officials were "100 percent" involved in the scandal.
"Of course! One hundred percent they are (involved). This cannot be possible without complicity of the locals," the newspaper, which has the highest circulation of any in Bangladesh, quoted Muhith as saying.
Muhith said the New York bank requires hand prints and other biometric information from central bank officials to activate transactions, appearing to suggest the hackers could not have carried out the attack without inside help.

Bread price rises to Rs.59
	
The price of a 450g loaf of bread was increased by Rs 4 with effect from effect from midnight. Accordingly the new price of a loaf would be about Rs 59.
All Ceylon Bakery Owners Association President N K Jayawardene told the Daily Mirror that they decided to increase the bread prices following the rise in price of white flour last week.
?We did not want to increase the prices last week as it was Consumer Week and now we have decided to do so,? he said.
However, Mr. Jayawardene said the association had not decided to increase the price of other bakery products but had given the bakery owners a free hand to decide on their own.
?We have told the bakery owners that they could increase the price of other products passing on the least possible burden to the people,? he said.
He said the white flour supplies should take the blame for the inconvenience, which the people might face in the wake of a price increase as they had immediately passed the burden on the bakery owners, when the Government imposed a tax on flour.
The Government, according to him, had decided to impose an import tax as the price of wheat flour had decreased in the global market. (Yohan Perera)
