Biswal, Power, Malinowski replaced, a slap in Govt's face: JO
	
The replacement of key US State Department officials such as Samantha Power, Nisha Biswal, Tom Malinowski and Susan Rice who were ?interested? in the internal affairs of Sri Lanka, is a slap aimed at the Sri Lankan Government, the joint opposition said today.
National organiser and MP Dullas Alahapperuma said this move shows that new US President Donald Trump had no intention of interfering in the internal affairs of other countries.
?Biswal and Malinowski were frequent visitors to Sri Lanka. Samantha Power was behind the US resolution on Sri Lanka on war crimes charges. The resolution was co-sponsored by Sri Lanka and approved at the UN Human Rights Council. These envoys spent more time here instead of attending to State Department work,? he told a news conference.
Samantha Power served as the US Ambassador to the UN from 2013 to 2017. She was replaced by former South Carolina Governor Nimrata "Nikki" Haley.
Nisha Desai Biswal was the Assistant Secretary of State for South and Central Asian Affairs.
Tomasz P. Malinowski served as Assistant Secretary of State for Democracy, Human Rights, and Labour. He was replaced by Virginia L. Bennett.
Susan Elizabeth Rice, the 24th US National Security Advisor was replaced by Michael T. Flynn who is a retired Army Lieutenant General.
The MP said US Ambassador Atul Keshap should pay close attention to new developments arising from President Trump's decisions in the wake of assuming office.
?We urge the Ambassador to respect our sovereignty and understand the change. President Trump has clearly stated that he has no interest in the internal affairs of other countries,? he said.(Lahiru Pothmulla)

Court directs SLMC to register SAITM's MBBS graduates
	
The Malambe Private Medical College better known as SAITM, hailed the Appeal Court ruling which allows the provisional registration of SAITM's MBBS graduates.
Chief Executive Officer Dr. Sameera Senaratne said in a statement that according to the laws of Sri Lanka, the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) was always obliged to register students with a degree in Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery from a degree-awarding institute, as per section 29(1)(b)(i) of the Medical Ordinance, amended in 1988, in the same manner as a student with a degree from a State medical faculty.
"The refusal by the SLMC to grant due provisional registration to SAITM's MBBS graduates was subsequently successfully challenged in the Appeal Court vide Case No.: CA/WRIT/187/2016," he said.
?Today?s decision also reaffirms the legal basis of SAITM as per Gazette Extraordinary No.1721/19 dated 30/11/2011 and subsequently No.1829/36 dated 26/09/2013 in terms of Section 25A of the Universities Act of 1978, and tabled in Parliament, to award the degrees of Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery (MBBS).? ?SAITM has always confidently asserted that its MBBS degree programme is on par with or even better than similar programmes offered by some state/foreign medical faculties?.
Dr. Senaratne said the historic ruling by the Appeal Court was a victory for SAITM's MBBS students who can now take their rightful place as fully-fledged doctors in this country.
"They have endured many hardships from opposing parties and now we are happy that justice has finally been served. We will continue to uphold the standards of the medical education in Sri Lanka in collaboration with all relevant authorities to produce doctors of highest standards,? he said.
Dr. Senaratne said the ruling is a just recognition of the rights of all institutions such as SAITM and the people of this country, who have steadfastly fought for the freedom of education in Sri Lanka. (S.S. Selvanayagam)

Don't eat croton warns Dr. Jayasumana
	
A medical expert said croton leaves were not edible and as such urged people not to consume them.
Dr. Channa Jayasumana, who heads the Pharmacology and Toxicologist Department of the Rajarata University's Medical Faculty, said the croton plant contains oil which was violently purgative and irritating qualities and is also suspected of being a co-carcinogen.
?Even when dried the plant retains its poisonous properties. Although certain South East Asian and South American tribes are able to detoxify croton leaves it is a complex procedure. In Chinese medicine, croton is used to induce loose motions,? he said.
Dr. Jayasumana said there were a few reports during the past couple of days that some people had consumed croton leaves resulting in abdominal symptoms though they were not of a serious nature.
?It is surprising as to why the Director General of Agriculture described croton as a consumable plant while we have hundreds of edible plants in the country, ?he said.(Kelum Bandara)

Elderly Sufi woman found with throat slit in Bangladesh
	
File photo: Bangladeshi teachers, students and social activists protest in Dhaka against killings of atheist bloggers, academics and religious minorities. ??

?
DHAKA AFP Jan30, 2017 ??
An elderly woman believed by followers to be a Sufi mystic has been found with her throat slit in Bangladesh, police said Monday, amid a wave of religiously motivated attacks. ??
The body of 72-year-old Nurjahan Begum was found in her shanty home in the capital Dhaka late Sunday, local police chief Faruqul Alam told AFP. ?
?
??Her throat was slit,? he said. ??
The woman was considered a ?pir?, or Sufi leader, by her followers who built her a home and donated food and cash, the English-language Daily Star newspaper reported. ??
But police said she was not a leader of the mystical Islamic sect but a mentally unstable woman, attracting followers who believed she had supernatural powers. ??
Fourteen Sufi leaders have been found with their throats slit in Bangladesh since 2013, with police blaming homegrown Islamist extremists. ?
?
Hardliners consider Sufism as heresy and have targeted its leaders. ??
In one of the worst cases a Sufi cleric, his son and four followers were found with their throats cut at their Dhaka home. ??
The Muslim-majority country of 160 million has been reeling from a wave of attacks on foreigners, rights activists and members of religious minorities. ??
Many of those have been claimed by the Islamic State group or Al-Qaeda. But Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina?s secular government has blamed local militants, denying that international jihadists have gained a foothold. ? ?

Health Ministry meeting goes berserk
	
Sri Lanka Society for Medical Laboratory Science (SLSMLS) President Ravi Kumudesh charged that Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) Assistant Secretary Dr. Naveen De Soysa had threatened him during a meeting held at the Health Ministry yesterday.
Mr. Kumudesh said he was invited for the meeting which was held to discuss about the organizational structure of the hospital laboratory last morning.
?The meeting was chaired by Director General of Health Services (DGHS) Dr. Jayasundara Bandara and it was attended by more than 25 laboratory professional colleagues. Except for me, all other attendees were medical doctors,? he told the Daily Mirror.
He said GMOA President Dr. Anuruddha Padeniya conducted a speech demeaning other professions in the health sector.
?He behaved as if the only profession that mattered in the sector was the medical doctor. As the only laboratory scientist who was present there, I objected to his speech and reasoned out. Then, Dr. Naveen De Soysa interrupted my speech and then he threatened me,? Kumudesh said.
He had complained to the DGHS over the matter and also lodged a complaint with the Senior DIG Nandana Munasinghe requesting necessary action to ensure the safety of his life with related to this incident.
However, Dr. Naveen Soysa rejected the charge and said it was Kumudesh who conducted a speech using strong words.
?I didn?t threaten him. It was Kumudesh who spoke in a bad manner. Our GMOA members left the meeting in protest and we showed our displeasure to the DGHS,? Dr. De Soysa said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Colombo Additional Magistrate Aruna Buddhadasa today permitted the FCID to check the bank accounts of company known as Hovell Constructions in the inquiry being conducted under the Money Laundering Act against Namal Rajapaksa and five others for purchasing Hello Corp shares from questionable funds.
The FCID said it had earlier filed two separate cases against the suspects on charges of obtaining Rs.30 million from Hovell Construction Company and Rs.15 million from Boston Capital Company for services provided by NR Consultancy and Gowers Corporation, which are headed by Mr. Rajapaksa.
It said Mr. Rajapaksa who dealt with Boston Capital and Hovell Construction had given Rs.15 million and Rs.30 million to these companies through a person identified as Indika Karunajeewa with the intention of concealing the origin of the questionable funds.
The FCID said that money was later transferred to Gowers Corporation and NR Consultancy, also headed by Mr. Rajapaksa, saying they were for services provided.
Inspector M.M. Sajith today sought court permission to check the bank accounts of Hovell Construction, which had dealt with NR Consultancy and Gowers Corporation.
The Magistrate also permitted one of the main witnesses Mr. Irriyagolla, to travel abroad between February 20 and March 6.

An unwavering Deputy Minister Ranjan Ramanayake said yesterday that he had not done anything wrong and therefore, he would not apologise to the Divulapitiya Divisional Secretary.
The Deputy Minister of Social Empowerment and Welfare expressed these views in response to the protest carried out by the Gampaha District Administrative Services Association (GDASA) yesterday against him for allegedly using strong words in public against the Divisional Secretary.
The protestors demanded the deputy minister to withdraw the alleged statement and to apologise to the official.
When contacted, the deputy minister alleged the divisional secretary of being corrupt and aiding illegal sand miners for money.
?This officer has been functioning in her post for seven years though a state employee should not exceed four years in their posts. There are many allegations against her. I intend to complain to the Bribery Commission against such employees,? he told the Daily Mirror.
The deputy minister said illegal sand mining was continuing for a long time in Akaragama causing hindrance to the residents.
?They are innocent people who needed immediate measures to prevent illegal sand mining. Though many complaints have been made, the secretary had not taken any action. This is why I had to confront her,? he said.
Meanwhile, Public Administration and Management Minister Ranjith Madduma Bandara had volunteered to apologise to the employee to which Deputy Minister Ramanayake had opposed.
?I told the minister there is no need to apologise since I haven?t done anything wrong. I will not back down until the Akaragama issue is solved,? he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Kansa to be produced locally for herbal medicines: Rajitha
	
The Ayurvedic Department is to launch a project to legally grow Kansa on a large scale and import Opium from India to be used in producing medicinal drugs, Health and Indigenous Medicine Minister Rajitha Senaratne said today.
He said he hoped the Maha Sangha would not oppose this plan because Kansa and Opium would be used only for the production of medicinal drugs under strict supervision.
The minister said this when participating at a BMICH ceremony to launch the latest Ayurvedic products by the well-known company 'Prana Jeewa', which manufactures and exports Ayurvedic drugs. He said the new trend among people worldwide was to turn to herbal medicine which had little or no side effects.
?In 2016, the global indigenous drugs market was worth US$54 billion but it will triple in the next three years. Though Western medicine has dominated many parts of the world, the herbal or indigenous medicine play a big role in treating disease in highly advanced countries like India, China and Korea,? the minister said.
He said in Kerala some 80% of the people turn to indigenous or Ayurvedic medicine while during the Anuradhapura era, the population population was healthy and diagnosis and treatment were solely based on traditional medicinal system.
The minister said the latest method of treatment in the world is gene therapy with the treatment being done targeting the DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) of a patient and the US has achieved much progress in this field with some 95% of western medicinal drugs being manufactured using herbal products.
He commended the initiative taken by Prana Jeewa Products Chairman Dr. Sujeewa Withange for taking the Sri Lanka indigenous products to the global market.
The minister said patents for a large number of our herbal plants have been obtained by foreign companies without any benefit to Sri Lanka and therefore, a mechanism must be put in place to protect our traditional medicinal products and herbal plants.
He said an international Ayurvedic Conerence torganized by the Health and Indigenous Medicine Ministry will be held in Sri Lanka in November and it would address many pressing issues and problems facing the Ayurvedic medical system of the country.

Question over Coca-Cola expansion project Rejected in India; welcomed in Lanka
	
At a time when Sri Lanka is looking at ways to preserve water and its natural resources, various multi-national stalwarts too are claiming territory. One such multi-national that made headlines in this way is the Coca-Cola Beverages Sri Lanka (Pvt) Ltd, which held discussions recently to request for an expansion project. Amidst closing down operations in India following protests over extensive extraction of ground water and thereby causing huge damage to ?the environment, Coca-Cola has had initial discussions with Finance ?Minister Ravi Karunayake to discuss the possibility of setting up a ?production factory in Sri Lanka and use ground water here to export some ?of its brands to India. During the past few years, the Coca-Cola Beverages Sri Lanka Ltd was subject to criticism on various grounds from careless handling of discharge to polluting the Kelani River. In an attempt to shed light on the concerns of this expansion, the Daily Mirror ?spoke to a few individuals of varied expertise, to consult their opinions regarding this project.
?
?The previous oil leakage was an accident??
CEA Chairman?
"The President himself has given us a mandate to continue any project that causes minimum or no damage to the environment."
Speaking to the Daily Mirror, Central Environmental Authority (CEA) Chairman, Prof. Lal Mervin Dharmasiri said that Sri Lanka is a country that depends on foreign investments. ?Through mega-scale factories they provide job opportunities for the locals in addition to many other benefits. But if they keep considering the environmental hazards, nothing could be done. The President himself has given us a mandate to continue any project that causes minimum or no damage to the environment. The previous oil leakage caused by the Coca-Cola factory was an accident and the company even issued a notice stating that they would be shifting to another place to prevent such damage from occurring again. The Coca-Cola factory recently signed a MoU with the CEA and will be funding Rs. 1.5 million to establish online water monitoring stations. The purpose of this project is to monitor the quality of water and also continue their work without causing any damage to the environment.? ??
?
?NWSDB cannot restrict abstraction of groundwater unless government requests?
G.m. - NWSBD
"There are no such government regulations in Sri Lanka at the moment but once they establish their project there will be a committee where the water board too will be a member"
In his comments GM of the National Water Supply and Drainage Board, G. A Kumararathne said that the NWSDB cannot restrict the abstraction of groundwater until the government requests them to restrict it. ?If they go for individual abstraction then they have to abide by certain limitations. Many people depend on groundwater and therefore if they start abstracting then there should be proper monitoring. There are no such government regulations in Sri Lanka at the moment but once they establish their project there will be a committee where the water board too will be a member. Here we will be commenting on the discharge, pollution and other negative consequences occurring from the project.?
?CEA shouldn?t encourage the initiatives of companies that could cause environmental damage??
- Director ECT
"The respective authorities were simply silenced after the company agreed to pay Rs. 131 million in compensation for the NWSDB for contaminating the river water with oil."
?The Director of the Environment Conservation Trust, Sajeewa Chamikara said that the Rs. 150 million worth fund that the Coca Cola Company intends to provide for the environmental restoration of the Kelani River is nothing but an initiation to divert authorities from seeing the real picture of the environmental damage caused to the river by the Company. ?The Central Environment Authority is not concerned about the rate at which the Kelani River is being polluted owing to the waste released into the water by the Coca Cola Company. They have polluted the river before and will continue to do the same in future too. The CEA has failed to take heed of the environmental damage caused to Kelani River by the Coca Cola Company during the past and this situation would continue to remain the same in future too. According to him, the waste products of the company are generally stored in large tanks and are released in to the river mostly during the rainy season. When the oil contamination in Kelani River surfaced, the CEA failed to take any legal action against the company responsible for the environmental damage and water pollution. ?The respective authorities were simply silenced after the company agreed to pay Rs. 131 million in compensation for the NWSDB for contaminating the river water with oil. CEA did not press charges against the Coca Cola Company since it agreed to pay the compensation for the environmental damage it caused to Kelani River back in 2015. I think that our environment authorities should play a much responsible role and not encourage the initiatives of companies that could harm our environment? he added.?
??
?We are committed to ensuring the long term conservation of local water resources??
Coca-Cola ??
?
"We are working jointly with local community based stakeholders in reducing the adverse and far-reaching impacts of CKD stricken areas in Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa"
In a statement issued by the Coca-Cola Beverages Sri Lanka Limited, a senior official said that at a recently held meeting between senior leaders of the Coca-Cola system and the Minister of Finance, Coca-Cola reiterated its commitment to Sri Lanka. ?In the backdrop of a stable and investor-friendly economy, the company expressed interest in further enhancing its investments in the country. The investment will significantly contribute towards the increase in supply chain infrastructure, manufacturing capacity and human capital which would undoubtedly enable job creation, portfolio expansion and thereby provide greater refreshment and choice to all our consumers and customers in Sri Lanka. ??
Our operating model is one that strives to create economic and social value across the chain and for the communities in which we operate. We are working jointly with local community based stakeholders in reducing the adverse and far-reaching impacts of CKD stricken areas in Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa . We are committed to working with partners from civil society and the government in ensuring the long term conservation of local water resources, primarily the Kelani River. A healthier community in harmony with a viable, sustainable and growing business is in the best interest of society and we are happy to play our part.? ??
Several attempts to contact Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake and State Minister of International Trade Sujeewa Senasinghe failed. ??

Trump sacks defiant attorney general
	
Donald Trump has fired the acting US attorney general, after she questioned the legality of his immigration ban.
Sally Yates, who had been appointed under Barack Obama, earlier ordered justice department lawyers not to enforce the president's executive order.
In a statement, the White House said Ms Yates had "betrayed" the department.
Dana Boente, US attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, replaces her as acting attorney general.
In a letter, Ms Yates had said she was "not convinced" that the president's order was lawful.
"As long as I am the acting attorney general, the department of justice will not present arguments in defence of the Executive Order," she said.
But the White House said she had "betrayed the department of justice by refusing to enforce a legal order designed to protect the citizens of the United States".
"President Trump relieved Ms Yates of her duties," a statement from the press secretary said.(BBC)
