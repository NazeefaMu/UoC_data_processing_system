British HC ?thinks? SL will have new constitution in 2017
	
British High Commissioner James Dauris said today he ?thinks? that the majority of Sri Lankans will be looking forward to having a new Constitution in 2017, ?One that will help create the right framework for really good long-term community relations.?
In a Christmas and New Year message, he said ?The majority of Sri Lankans will, I think, be looking forward to having in 2017 a new Constitution, one that will help create the right framework for really good long-term community relations. They will be keen to see more advances towards reconciliation.?
?As 2016 comes to an end it?s a good time to take a moment to reflect on some of the things that Sri Lanka and the UK have done together and achieved over the past twelve months. And as we all look forward to the start of the new year, it?s worth taking a moment to reflect on the opportunities and challenges 2017 will bring for our two countries, and on what will be important to us and what we would like to achieve in the months ahead,? Mr. Darius said.
Highlighting the assistance given to Sri Lanka in various fields, he said, ?We share the welcome given by people in every community in Sri Lanka to the many positive steps taken over the year to help achieve and advance reconciliation between communities.

CB stance on Perpetual Treasuries queried
	
State Minister and SLFP media spokesman Dilan Perera yesterday questioned as to how and why the controversial Primary Dealer Perpetual Treasuries Ltd.still remained in the Bond Market if the Central Bank conducted an internal inquiry on its conduct and took action accordingly.
He said the SLFP would take a decision on incumbent Central Bank Governor Indrajith Cumaraswamy if action is not taken against the Perpetual Treasuries Ltd,.
Minister Perera responding to a journalist at the weekly SLFP news briefing at the party office said the SLFP still had confidence in Mr. Cumaraswamy as a man of words and a professional with integrity but his stand on the controversial bond market dealer was confusing.
The journalist referring to a Central Bank communique released yesterday on the issuance of Rs. 57,000 million Treasury Bonds had instructed the public to purchase Treasury Bonds from 16 Primary Dealers including Perpetual Treasuries Ltd.
The journalist asked Minister Perera as to how and why this particular controversial Primary Dealer still remains in the Bond Market after allegations had been leveled against the company by the COPE inquiry report in Parliament. The COPE inquiry had found the Perpetual Treasuries Ltd. had engaged in improper bond dealings.
?I can?t understand as to how and why the Perpetual Treasuries Ltd. Continues to deal in the Bond Market after Mr. Cumaraswami?s repeated claims that he had conducted several internal inquires on this company and took appropriate measures accordingly. I would like to know about these so called inquiries and action taken against the company if what Mr. Cumarswami tells us is true,? Minister Perera stressed.
Minister Perera added that the Parliament would debate the COPE report in January and the Speaker Karu Jayasuriya will send the report to the Attorney General for his review and necessary legal action on the bond scam. (Sandun A Jayasekera)

The Prime Minister's office yesterday dismissed Committee on Public Enterprises (COPE) Chairman Sunil Handunnetti's allegation that referring the COPE report on the bond scam to the Attorney General was wrong.
The statement said Mr Handunnetti had criticized this move by the Prime Minister when the COPE secretary had also referred it to the Attorney General.

The Prime Minister referred the COPE report to the AG on November 2 seeking his advice on the matter. ?Also the Prime Minister, as the subject minister, had informed the Parliament Secretary General on November 9, to send several more documents, as requested by the Attorney General with the permission of the Speaker of Parliament,? the statement said. ?On several occasions, the Prime Minister himself informed Parliament about these developments. And even agreed to have a debate on the COPE report and on all those occasions, MP Handunnetti didn?t mention that the Prime Minister had used the Speaker's powers and now he (Handunnetti) was attempting to build such an argument.?
The statement said "Parliament has already expressed its views on the committee on Public Enterprises (COPE) report."
The statement also said that all members of COPE who represents political parties in parliament had stated that they accepted the COPE report.

Problems go far by not talking: Wijeyadasa
	
Justice Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe, who met Batticaloa's Mangalaramaya Temple Chief Incumbent Ven. Ampitiye Sumanarathana Thera, said the problems had worsened because those who say the monks are creating them had not discussed these matters with a view to solving them.
?We cannot find solutions by hiding or sweeping problems under the carpet. I was criticised when I spoke about them in parliament. We have a right to express our views and as citizens our responsibility is to create a peaceful country for the future generations,? he said.
The minister said the minority issues differ from district to district and province to province with the minority in one part of the country being a majority elsewhere as such Tamils and Muslim could not be described as minorities.
He said the Sinhalese are in the majority in the South, the Tamils are in the majority in Batticaloa.
?There were some 28,000 Sinhalese living in Batticaloa before the war. Now the population has been decreased and as a minority in Batticaloa the Sinhalese have problems,? the minister said.
He said during his meeting with the monk he was informed not only of the concerns of the Sinhalese but also of the Tamils and Muslims living in Batticaloa.
The minister said thee was no Sinhala MP to represent the Batticaloa District and there is no Sinhala provincial
councillor in the Eastern Provincial Council to highlight the concerns of the Sinhalese people resulting in them being overwhelmed by these problems.
?In some areas, the minority Sinhalese have been unable to obtain a Gramasewaka certificate and as such are unable to enter their names in the voters list. They had lost their inherited lands as well. Some officials in the Divisional Secretariats refuse to read a letter which is in Sinhala even if they are capable of doing so. There have been instances where some of these officers have been known to have dumped letters written in Sinhala to the dustbin. It is in this backdrop that the chief incumbent of the Mangalaramaya had exposed these matters so that the people and the politicians became aware of them,? the minister said.
He said that at least now attempts were being made to identify the issues and create an environment conductive for all people in the country to live peacefully irrespective of their religion, caste or race. (Chaturanga Pradeep)

SL refugee advocate loses son, wife in blaze in New Zealand
	
A fundraising campaign for a man whose wife, son and mother-in-law perished in a fire yesterday has amassed thousands of dollars within 12 hours, the New Zealand Herald reported today.
Prominent refugee advocate Kaileshan Thanabalasingham was in a critical condition after a South Auckland fire claimed three generations from his family. His 5-year-old son, 39-year-old wife and her 66-year-old mother died in the fire at the Plantation Ave home in Flat Bush.
His 11-year-old daughter and father-in-law managed to get out of the blaze and have now been discharged from Middlemore Hospital.
A Givealittle page has raised more than $45,000 since it was set up after the tragedy.
Barrister Deborah Manning said Kaileshan Thanabalasingham had worked tirelessly for other people since he came to New Zealand as a refugee more than 10 years ago.
"He's got a great empathy for others. He didn't come to New Zealand to look after himself. He made sure he looked after as many people as he could.
"Everybody is just in a state of shock and stress and utter sadness for the loss of his beautiful wife and son."
Thanabalasingham is an executive officer of the Refugee Council of New Zealand and has dedicated his life in this country to helping the most vulnerable new citizens.
He is now recovering from hours of surgery in the hospital's intensive care unit after suffering burns to 40 per cent of his body.
Manning was "utterly shocked and devastated" when she found out what had happened to her friend and colleague. She rushed to the hospital to assist. He was in theatre at the time but Manning will go back today to support Thanabalasingham.
"It's an absolute tragedy for Kailesh and his family. He is really an exceptional person."
The Refugees as Survivors New Zealand members behind the fundraising page say Thanabalasingham's daughter and father-in-law have been left badly shocked by the ordeal.
"Refugees as Survivors New Zealand are involved because we respect and admire Kailesh for his work with asylum seekers and refugees in the community. If anyone was in trouble, day or night, he would help them.
"The least we can do is to help him in his hour of need."
The group says their badly injured friend and advocate now faces huge expenses including funeral, medical and practical costs.
As a sign of their love for him they were reaching out to the community to help a man who had given so much to others.
With the total quickly surging into the tens of thousands by mid-morning the group said it was heartened and thankful for everyone's generous support.
Family friend Sivaram Anandasivam said Thanabalasingham was a pillar of the Sri Lankan and wider ethnic communities and the news of the tragedy had stunned everyone.
"We are all very upset. Everyone is gathering at the hospital hoping for the best,? said Anandasivam.
The injured father-in-law and his wife who died in the blaze were Canadian citizens.
Extended family was flying from Canada to New Zealand to support those who had survived the tragedy.
Refugee Council of New Zealand vice president Colin Henry had heard about the fire but didn't realize Thanabalasingham was involved until the media called at midday yesterday.
Henry said he was "at a loss for word. It is horrible for anyone, but when you know the person it has a particularly profound impact."
Henry said Thanabalasingham was deeply passionate about refugee rights. "He pretty much ran the administrative side of the council and ensured everything was shipshape."
Some of his notable work included successfully advocating for the increase of the refugee quota from 750 to 1000, which will take effect from 2018.
He also pushed for permission for more than one person in a family of asylum seekers to obtain a work permit while waiting for the determination of their refugee application. Previously only one family member was allowed a work permit.
Henry said the family was going to need a lot of support to help them through this tragedy. "The Sri Lankan community are rallying around and providing the immediate housing needs of the daughter."
It emerged Thanabalasingham's daughter bravely escaped the blaze to tell firefighters people were trapped inside.
Police said they were continuing a scene examination of the home and the deaths would be referred to the coroner. They do not believe the fire was suspicious, but the cause was still unknown. The Fire Service is investigating.

To leave or remain in unity govt.
	
The Unity Government is 15 months old now and the SLFP Central Committee (CC) is expected to review the performance of the government in September next year and decide whether to remain further in the unity government or leave if not satisfied, Minister and SLFP media spokesman Dilan Perera said.
Minister Perera told the media at the weekly news briefing of the SLFP at the party office yesterday that a lot of water had passed under the bridge since the formation of the UNP - SLFP led unity government since the August 2015 general election with plenty of consensus, disagreements, debates, brickbats and acrimony.
He added that however the SLFP members within the government had been able to record a number of victories and direct the unity government on the right path.
?The term of office of the unity government is scheduled to expire in September 2017 after the completion of two years according to the agreement between the UNP and the SLFP signed in September 2015 after the August general election. But there is an unwritten agreement between the General Secretaries of both parties, Ministers Kabir Hashim and Duminda Dissanayaka to run for the entire term of five years. That is why we expect to review the performance of the unity government since its formation and take a decision on the fate of the unity government in next September,? Minister Perera stressed.
He pointed out that the protests raised by the SLFP group in the government with the assistance of the media had done a lot of good for the unity government, the country and people and continue to do so as long as the SLFP remains in the unity government.
?First and foremost, we were able to prevent the extension of the term of office of controversial governor of the Central Bank, Arjuna Mahendran who was allegedly involved in the bond scam in February 2015. Secondly, the SLFP in the government is also responsible for the series of reforms introduced to the Budget 2016 including the increase of VAT revenue threshold of small scale traders to Rs. 100,000 from proposed Rs. 33,000. Thirdly, the SLFP will never agree to create a super minister despite the UNP attempts through the proposed Development (Special Provisions) Bill,? Minister Perera added.
?Members of the joint opposition ask us whether we remain in the government with clothes on. I like to tell them that we prevented the unity government from going disarray and taking anti-people steps whether in nude or with clothes on. We are proud as SLFPers for such people friendly measure taken by the unity government on our intervention,? he said.
Minister Perera said the policy of the SLFP in the government had been well vindicated to the fact that the UNP asked them to leave the government while the JO accused them saying that they licked the bones thrown at them by the UNP and added if the SLFP was not a part of the government, all those anti people measures would have been implemented by the UNP.
The UNP members of the government tell the SLFP members and to me in particular leave the government to go ahead with them and bring back Mahendran, create the post of super minister and increase indirect tax and VAT, he said. .
He said it was at the SLFP news briefing, he first disclosed the secret deal between certain members of the UNP and Basil Rajapaksa aimed at destroying the SLFP led by President Maithripala Sirisena which had been proved beyond any doubt and expressed his gratitude to the media for making the conspiracy a big issue in the political circles, among the public and the media.
The deal between the UNP and Basil was very clear as the government let Basil to leave the country for three months but Tissa Attanayaka, the former General Secretary of the UNP was not given that benefit. (Sandun A Jayasekera)

Vehicles for 58 parliamentarians put on hold
	
The move to provide vehicles to 58 parliamentarians under an operational lease at a total cost of Rs.2.4 billion, has been temporarily halted, UPFA General Secretary Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said today.
The controversial move came under heavy criticism.
It ran into a snag when the Secretary of the Ministry of Parliamentary Reforms and Mass Media Ministry Secretary Nimal Bopage refused to sign the document approving the issue of the vehicles. He said his refusal was based on several issues and that he was asked to ?Sign or resign?.
Mr. Bopage said this proposal had not received the approval of the Technological Committee and that repayment was to be completed in 60 monthly instalments but the present parliament had only another 45 months to go and that he had no right to burden a future parliament with the remaining instalments.
Meanwhile, the 58 MPs were to hand over petitions to the President and the Prime Minister asking to remove Mr. Bopage from the post of ministry secretary. A government source said the MPs were of the opinion that Mr. Bopage should be removed from his post as he had opposed the Cabinet which had approved the proposal to provide the vehicles.
Earlier, Chief Opposition Whip Anura Kumara Dissanayake highlighted the fact that the 58 MPs were being currently paid a monthly transport allowance of Rs.200,000.
