GMOA seeks urgent meeting with President
	
The Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) has today written to President Maithripala Sirisena requesting him for an immediate meeting to discuss several issues including their trade union action and their request for the Health Ministry to be placed under his purview.
In the letter, GMOA President Anurudda Padeniya had said the Health Ministry had failed to harness thepositive contribution that could be provided by the GMOA because of the anti-GMOA policy adopted by Minister Rajitha Senaratne.
?The entire health sector is in chaos today. The ministry?s reputation upheld during your tenure as minister is deteriorating because of individualistic and family-based action by the current minister,? Dr. Padeniya said.
The GMOA reiterated its request for the President to take over the ministry so as to prevent a breakdown of the health sector. ?This is the view of a majority in the health sector as the best option in this situation,? he said.
In the letter, Dr. Padeniya said the GMOA Central Committee had opted for trade union action even though they disliked doing so. ?However, we will not allow any breakdown in treating emergency cases or in the treatment offlood victims,? he said.

I will not be deterred by GMOA's threats: Rajitha
	
Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne, in response to a strike planned by doctors, said he would not shy away from such threats.
He urged the Government Medical Officers' Association not to put people's lives in jeopardy by resorting to trade union action because of unfounded charges against the health authorities.
The minister said a merit system had been introduced for both the internship and the post internship appointments of doctors.
?The GMOA sought representation at a transfer board. Only the Health Ministry decides on appointments depending on vacancies and shortcomings. Certain hospitals in the north and the east and Nuwara Eliya were closed down because of interference by the GMOA. We are now going to reopen them,? he said.
He said, ?I will not be cowed by any Mafia group. A trade union bureau has been opened at the Ministry. I suggested that trade union office bearers be released from work for full time activities at this place. But, they have not acted on it. (Kelum Bandara)

Vajira denies appointing Palpita to Home Affairs Ministry
	
Home Affairs Minister Vajira Abeywardena today denied having any hand in the appointment of Telecommunications Regulatory Commission's former director general Anusha Palpita as an additional secretary to his ministry.
He said Mr. Palpita was appointed by the Public Services Commission (PSC) and was transferred by the Public Administration and Management Ministry to the Home Affairs Ministry during the recent floods.
?This particular officer was attached to the Public Administration Ministry's officials pool when the new government assumed office in January 8 last year. During the recent rains that ravaged the country, several officials of our ministry were also sent on relief duty and contributed immensely to the relief operations. When we requested for officials from the Public Administration Ministry, they sent officials from its pool and Mr. Palpita was one of them,? the minister told a news conference held at the ministry.
The minister categorically denied reports that Mr. Palpita was one of his friends and that he was attempting to defend by transferring Mr. Palpita to the Home Affairs Ministry. ?I have never met him nor had spoken to him,? he said.
When asked about the charges levelled against Mr. Palpita in the ?Sil Redi? fraud, the minister said the PSC may not have been informed about the charges.
Anusha Palpita and former presidential secretary Lalith Weeratunga were named as accused in the ?Sil Redi? case where the TRC was alleged to have spent Rs.600 million to distribute 'Sil Redi' to the people as part of the former presidents election propaganda campaign. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Vehicle price hike to avoid unwanted buyers: John
	
Tourism Minister John Amaratunga today said the Government was compelled to increase vehicle prices because it would reduce the number of vehicles on the roads and also avoid unnecessary people purchasing vehicles.
Speaking to reporters after an event in Galewela, Wahakotte, the Minster said three-wheeler prices were increased in the wake of the fast-increasing number of such vehicles and on the request by some three-wheeler associations.
?While it appears that there is an increase in the price of luxury vehicles, I think it is alright if the affluent people can afford it. Let them buy if they can afford. There is no notable increase in the prices of ordinary cars. I don't see anything wrong in increasing vehicle prices. There are more cars now in the country and it is difficult to travel in vehicles in Colombo or Kurunegala because of the traffic. Cars are being purchased by everyone today irrespective of their job positions or social needs. The number of three-wheelers have also increased manifold creating a loss of income to the users. Many three wheeler operators complain that they have no hires. We cannot restrict imports and therefore we had to tactfully increase the prices so that there would be a lesser demand,? he said.
"Cars should be used by high income groups but now owning a car has become a fashion or a trend with the owners mixing up their priorities, " he said adding that he was unable to make a ruling on who should or should not purchase cars and that until the gazette was issued he was not in a position to say anything about the car prices.

He said inside sources at the DLB had informed him that the loss had occurred when Dr. Pathiraja had violated accepted tender procedures by awarding promotional work on Janajaya and the Super Ball lotteries to a company known as D2 of S2 of which his cousin was a director.
During cross examination by PC Kalinga Indatissa Mr. Herath said that even though he had made the complaint to the BC he had not checked the names of the directors from the Registrar of Companies because it was the duty of the BC to do so.
Further trial was postponed for October 24.
