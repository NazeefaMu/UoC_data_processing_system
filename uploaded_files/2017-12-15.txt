A back seat because of the company he keeps!
	
A local politico who attended an opening of a building was looking for a seat in the front row when an organizer showed him a seat far behind. ?Sir, this is the seat reserved for you?, the organizer had told him pointing to the seat.
The politico had flared up, but stopped short of creating a scene.
The construction work on this building had got underway when this politico was the mayor.
The politico was consigned to a rear seat at the ceremony because he has of late thrown in his lot with an opposition political leader, they say.

A shell shocked world: More cuts on the private sphere
	
The private sphere of this country and of most other post colonial societies, even India, did not open up fully to the Westernised paradigm of modernity and progress that it was supposed to. What we got instead was a fatal contradiction, since that sphere, in whatever form and sector (even education) uprooted itself from cultural sensibilities and at the same time followed the worst elements of a patriarchal, quasi-feudalistic world.?
The emergence and creation of an alternative education sector, free from the constraints of the Ministry of Education was one method of catering to that?world view
By denying their children a proper space to learn that language, the maw basa, they were in effect turning the need into an option: it was no longer mandatory to seep oneself in the past?as before
?
?
?
When CEOs of global companies from our part of the world contend, in front of a panel or interviewers, that it is good karma for women not to ask for pay rises, they are pandering to the superficial elements of a culture, any culture, which does not require them to let go of their Westernised outlook. The cosmetics of such cultures (the ?pansakulaya, malwatti, and upparawatti? as Professor Nalin de Silva memorably wrote) appeal to those who believe that even in the private sphere, a balance must be struck between the need to be ?nationalised? and also ?globalised.?? ?
This was largely a legacy of the split in the Buddhist order, firstly between the laity and the clergy achieved by the British after we were colonised, and secondly between the traditionalists and the reformists, the wielders of the faith and the wielders of a new secularism, that the intrusion of Theosophy brought about. By this I am not belittling the attempts of Colonel Olcott or Helena Blavatsky, rather I am pointing out that in the Theosophist movement we see a sustained division between the worldly and the otherworldly (noted by William Ames and Heinz Bechert) that found its way to post colonial societies like ours. By artificially creating a rift between culture and society, the proponents of this new secularism had found a rationale for their offspring and even they themselves to wallow in the materialism, the crass consumerism, and Westernisation which their parents and grandparents had fervently opposed in 1956.? ?
He subtly points out the gulf between the idealists and the pragmatists, between the devotees and the secularists, between the nationalists and the ?nationalists?
The new secularists, who were veritable champions of the cosmetic elements of culture, were the ?children of the children? (as I pointed out in last week?s column): they let themselves be overwhelmed by the new culture of social uplift. It was a new way of thinking, of looking at the world (they would call this ?positive thinking? as the years went by), and the result of it all was that they were only too willing to target those who shared that world view. The emergence and creation of an alternative education sector, free from the constraints of the Ministry of Education, was one method of catering to that world view, and our new secularists, whose own children would go beyond them in being Westernised and uprooted, soon became shrewd businessmen. Those who went through this alternative education sector from the nineties can attest to the fact that these institutions were never preoccupied with the profit motive ? and those behind them were not enamoured of that profit motive either, yet ? because they didn?t need to be: they had targeted the perfect single market, less a market, in fact, than a collective inhibited by an?inferiority complex.? ?
Gunadasa Amarasekara writes about this collective and milieu in many of his novels after Yali Upannemi and Karumakkarayo (the last two he wrote before he renounced the Western conception of literature he had been entranced by), particularly (though I have not read them yet) the cycle of stories revolving around Piyadasa (Gamanaka Mula, Gamanaka Mada, etc). He subtly points out the gulf between the idealists and the pragmatists, between the devotees and the secularists, between the nationalists and the ?nationalists?. It?s an interesting phenomenon, certainly, one which shows us that no matter how universally feasible globalisation may be, all it does at the end of the day is destroy entire collectives while preserving the cosmetic elements of the cultures of those collectives: Keats?s Grecian Urn, Lawrence?s Arabia. For the West the East can only be salvaged through those cosmetics, an attitude largely shared by the new secularists who emphasised on rote learning history and religion in their institutions. History is not a series of dates that need to be remembered, and religion is not a series of sermons and chants that need to be memorised. They are more, much more, than what their surfaces will have you believe. The children of the children were guilty for having abandoned in their professional lives their faith and heritage, so when they targeted the cultural sensibility they themselves acceded to, they tried to ensure that both faith and heritage would remain (ostensibly) core elements of their curriculum. I remember one of these new secularists, who had sent her child to one of these institutions at the behest of an aunt, impatiently glaring at one of those commentators who on television frequently reiterated the need to know one?s language properly. By denying their children a proper space to learn that language, the maw basa, they were in effect turning the need into an option: it was no longer mandatory to seep oneself in the past as before, it was rather a choice that had to be made by their children.? ?
This was largely a legacy of the split in the Buddhist order, firstly between the laity and the clergy achieved by the British after we were colonised, and secondly between the traditionalists and the reformists, the wielders of the faith and the wielders of a new secularism, that the intrusion of Theosophy brought about
It was a half-baked world but one can?t blame those who were resident in it because no culture, in this post- colonial phase of history, can survive the inhibitions of those who imbibe the Western paradigm of development and modernism. Limited to one or two periods, the maw basa (Sinhala and Tamil), the agama (particularly Buddhism), and the sanskruthiya (based largely on extracurricular activities like dancing, music, and the Hewisi Band) were by and by afterthoughts of the new secularists who wanted a premium education for their children, even though these subjects and activities had the effect of entrancing those children to the culture their elders were repudiating. The world had moved on, and the elders were still very much behind. They wanted their children to learn faster, to let go of any affiliations to their country and even live abroad. Even our nationalist politicians see no contradiction in subscribing to this attitude when it comes to the education of their offspring. It?s an elephant in the room.? ?
The debate over the international school system has so far been conducted by the rabid nationalists and the would-be modernists: the former decry any attempt at opening an alternative space in our education sector, while the latter see in that space a veritable chance of redeeming their inhibitions, their sense of inferiority, by westernising their children. No proper debate, consequently, has followed our international schools because the extremists, on either side, have so far headed it. It is my contention that the international school system as is present in Sri Lanka, particularly with respect to schools which target a bourgeoning middle class, opens up a complex interrelationship between the imperatives of culture and the imperatives of the material world, an interrelationship that I believe deserves extensive treatment in another article.? ? ?

Appreciation Shalini Nanayakkara was certainly a fountain of untold kindness
	
One of a kind, she certainly was a fountain of kindness untold. It is amazing how Shalini?s heart flew out to those in need, in despair or lonely. Grabbing every opportunity with both hands, to serve a seriously sick child with parents desperate or to assist someone in abject poverty and yearning for medical care, Shalini would pack more into her already bursting schedule of her household and family commitments, ensuring however that the needs of her dearest husband and three adored children are well taken care of. Her car was at times a taxi with driver Shalini at the wheel running an errand or giving a lift to a needy. Her energy?was amazing.? ?
This graduate in Information Technology, having qualified in Canada and having worked until she became a mother, decided to quit work and give her whole to her family. She raised the children dexterously. Among others, Mandrinee?s and Uvindra?s graduations and Janendra?s success in rugby at Royal College were feathers in her cap. She was such a support to Nilmin when it came to entertaining his business partners on numerous parties and X?mas celebrations of Nkar Travels. Her family was her pride?and joy.? ?
During the years she was involved in the Past Pupils Association of her Alma Mater, Bishops College, she earned the reputation of a ?doer? taking the centre stage in organizing many an event benefiting the school. When circumstances warranted, she did not hesitate or shy away to make representations to the Board of Governors. She had this inherent flare to get people going so as to transpose a hopeless situation to a very successful, happy ending. That was?her metal.?
?
Multi - faceted Shalini had a very spiritual side to her as well. Having married Nilmin, Shalini who came from a very much non vegetarian family, chose to be vegetarian within a short period into their marriage. She was a regular at Narada Centre observing Ata Sil on Poya Days, unless some unavoidable circumstance held her back. I recall her text messages saying, ?tomorrow is Poya ? Sil? and often we did observe Sil together. Having finished the day of Sil which is generally tiring, she had the bubbling energy to drag Nilmin, Mandrinee, Uvindra and Janendra to the Temple and any excuse to not go, was dismissed. She found time for meditation lessons and retreats and she had just begun to introduce meditation to her family when she was dealt with the unfair blow. This was Shalini.? ?
To her beloved father who pre-deceased her and to her loving mother, she was the son they never had. For her two loved sisters, ?Lokuakki? was the pillar of strength. To us, her in-laws, she was a sister rather than a sister-in-law. For this special person, any excuse would suffice to get together and have a good time flavoured with so much laughter, food and drink. She was a woman of spirit. Shalini had a passion to travel nationally and internationally and I believe I may not be wrong in saying that she did cover at least one fourth of the globe. Their holiday in South Africa was sadly not meant to be due to her ill health. She enjoyed fine things in life including good, wide and varied food. Although chocolates and cakes were her weakness, she maintained a decent balance, exercising regularly. A mutual friend once told me that she shed sunshine wherever she went. Beautiful and charming Shalini was such an epitome of health and one and all who knew her were simply aghast when she turned out to be victim to the dreaded disease. It was an absolute irony for she was a volunteer at the Children?s Ward at Maharagama for years and until she was struck down, most unexpectedly and surprisingly .She kept calm presumably for the sake of the others. That?was her.? ?
The doctor under whom she volunteered at Maharagama was a great strength to her and the family. Nilmin with their three children left no stone unturned to keep her with us and not let her go. She came round and was fine for a good six months back again to her usual self but that was to fleet. Western, Ayurvedic, homoeopathy, religious observances and what not was all done leaving out nothing. Alas! It all ended, on that Friday evening when she very peacefully made her gentle exit with all her close family around her chanting Pirith. For the fifty four years she lived, she accomplished a life of eighty four years. She led a full life, and left behind a great void.? ?
May her sojourn in Sansara be short, free of disease, be it life threatening or other and at the end of which, may she attain the supreme bliss of Nirvana. Nahi Jathu Gabba Seiyang Punarethithi!? ?

Countries should follow SL in joining Ottawa Treaty: HRW
	
Other countries should reconsider joining the Ottawa Treaty to ban landmines following Sri Lanka?s accession to the treaty on Wednesday, the Human Rights Watch (HRW) said.
HRW Arms Director Steve Goose?on Thursday said Sri Lanka?s accession should spur other nations that haven?t joined the landmine treaty to take another look at why they want to be associated with such an obsolete, abhorrent weapon.?
?This should spur other countries that haven?t joined the treaty to review their position and address any obstacles to joining it,??he said.
Sri Lanka deposited its instrument of accession to the treaty with the United Nations in New York, becoming the 163rd country to join.
The Mine Ban Treaty comprehensively bans antipersonnel landmines, and requires destruction of stockpiles, clearance of mined areas, and assistance to victims of the weapons.
The HRW said Sri Lanka participated as an observer in the fast-track diplomatic Ottawa Process, which led to the adoption of the Mine Ban Treaty in September 1997, but said it could not sign due to its ongoing conflict with the LTTE.
?Since then Sri Lank?expressed its support for the humanitarian objectives of the Mine Ban Treaty and voted in favor of every annual UN General Assembly resolution on it. In December 2015, Sri Lanka announced that it was ?seriously considering? joining the Treaty ?as a matter of priority? following ?a paradigm shift? in policy after the election of a new government in January 2015,? it said.
According to the HRW, the Sri Lankan?army has acknowledged using antipersonnel mines in the past while the LTTE produced and used them extensively during the armed conflict.
?After deliberating for almost two decades, Sri Lanka ultimately decided to get on the right side of history by relinquishing antipersonnel mines. With every country that joins the treaty, the norm against these weapons only gets stronger,? Mr. Goose said.
Non-signatories?of Ottawa Treaty
Thirty-three UN countries including the US, China, India, Pakistan, Myanmar, United Arab Emirates, Cuba, Egypt, Israel, Iran and Russia have not yet signed the Ottawa Treaty. Marshall Islands has signed the Treaty but not yet ratified it.

Dealing with Dyslexia   Parents and teachers have  huge roles to play
	
?
Dyslexia is a common cause that creates learning difficulties. This condition in turn causes problems with reading, writing and spelling. Having a child with dyslexia can be an additional hurdle in parenthood. Speaking to the Health Capsule, Dr. Jithangi Wanigasinghe, Senior Lecturer in Paediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, Colombo and Consultant Paediatric Neurologist, Lady Ridgeway Hospital explained what dyslexia is and how it can be identified. Furthermore, she explained that the main features of the disorder are having difficulties in spelling and reading. Dr. Wanigasinghe added that when there is early detection dyslexia can be managed and parents and teachers should work closely. Parents and teachers must work together to create mechanisms to clear the child?s path for learning. Raising a child with dyslexia is a journey. As parents move through this phase they will gain lifelong experience and knowledge regarding the challenges their children face. They will learn how to help their children succeed at school and in life.? ?
What is Dyslexia?? ?
Explaining as to what dyslexia is, Dr. Wanigasinghe said, ? This is a problem related to reading fluently, spelling and learning a second language, in spite of reasonable intelligence?.? ?
She further explained how common it is. ?There are no studies in Sri Lanka estimating the burden created by the disease. Studies from other countries reveal that this condition is quite common. It is the commonest cause for learning difficulties. There are different presentations varying from mild to severe with regard to this problem. There are many famous persons who suffered from dyslexia, yet they excelled in their fields,?said Dr. Wanigasinghe.? ?
Speaking of the defect she said, ? The main defect is related to difficulty in the use and processing of linguistic and symbolic codes, alphabetic letters representing speech sounds or numeric representing numbers or quantities?.? ?
?This is not due to a structural defect, but rather due to a problem of functional areas related to language processing, particularly in the left hemisphere in the left pareito-temporal functional system,? she explained.? ?
How to identify a person? ?
Dr. Wanigasinghe went on to explain the common features that are related to reading difficulties. ? They have an overall difficulty in learning how to connect letters with a sound. They will have difficulty in recognizing a word - this is characterized by omissions, substitutions, reversal of letters, sounds, syllables or words.
Furthermore the individual will have decoding difficulties, deficits in interpreting left and right, will require extra time and effort for processing language, have severe spelling difficulties, memory deficits, have poor coordination (hand ?eye), difficulty in remembering dates, numbers and lists,? explained the doctor.? ?
The doctor further explained that family history is identified as a risk factor as well as many others postulated associations.? ?
Diagnosis and management? ?
Speaking of the diagnosis Dr. Wanigasinghe explained that most often the diagnosis is delayed. ?If a child is having difficulty in reading, he or she should be assessed for dyslexia. However, there is no standard lab test or imaging modality that can diagnose dyslexia,? she explained.? ?
?
She further explained that there is no medical treatment for dyslexia, but it can be managed with early recognition and appropriate interventions. ?The management of the condition includes evaluation and working out individualized teaching-learning strategies for the child with help of teacher. Teachers can help by allocating more time for reading and spelling and giving explicit simple instructions. The parents themselves can play a big role in helping their children,? she said.? ?
Advice
?You should address the problem early, talk to your teachers and then to a paediatrician and educate yourself about the problem. The parent needs input from a teacher trained to use teaching methods and tools for children with dyslexia.? she advised.? Furthermore, Dr. Wanigasinghe said, ? Parents should work with teachers to identify specific areas of weakness and strengths in your child and understand the underlying causes of their child?s difficulty. The child may need to have an Individualised Education Programme (IEP) worked out for the child .?? ?
Misconceptions? ??
There are misconceptions people have of dyslexia. ?The misconceptions include; dyslexia only affects people who speak English, writing letters and words backwards are symptoms of dyslexia, reading disabilities are caused by visual perception problems, children will outgrow dyslexia if you give them time and more boys than girls have dyslexia,? explained the doctor.? ?

Essential items at subsidized prices till April '18: PM
	
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said today the climate change crisis calls for a long-term solution and that the decision to supply essential items at a subsidized prices would be extended till National New Year in 2018.
He said this at the opening of the new bus stand in Gampaha Town this morning.
?The expected rains in November and December were inadequate. Therefore crop harvests will be low next year. I and the President met the ministerial committee on the cost of living. We invited private sector representatives as well. We did so because the government does not have an adequate machinery to cover all areas geographically. We decided to provide rice, dhal, sugar, potatoes, onions, sprats and long beans at subsidized prices. The rates will be decided on the landed price,? the Prime Minister said.
?We as a government strive towards resolving the issues faced by this government. One of the major issues faced by the people today is the high cost of living. Prices of essential goods have risen rapidly. There is a crisis with regard to climate. We have not received monsoon rains on time. This has affected the cultivation of food crops. Some farmers kept away from cultivating because of the drought. We do not know whether the climatic changes would create a long term issues. As a precaution for this crisis of price hike, the government has decided to provide essential items at subsidized prices till the national new year. High prices of rice, coconuts and vegetables is a major issue. The government is fully aware of it. It is essential to resolve this matter as soon as possible.?
He said the decision on extending the concession scheme would be decided in April next year after assessing the situation taking into account climatic changes.
"We will decide on the next step in April as it would be possible to make a fresh assessment on the climate at that time. Several key private sector organizations will also play a role in providing essentials at a subsidized prize. Private sector suppliers of essential goods have said they would be able to implement the new scheme in two week?s time,? the Prime Minister said."
Megapolis and Western Province Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka said the present government was making an effort to make development beneficial to the people. ?Development becomes effective when it brings benefits to the people. There is no point in constructing ports and airports if they do not bring any economic benefit. Development should not burden the economy as it did in the past where large commercial borrowings were made for projects. Development should not benefit individuals,? he said.
MP Ajith Manappaeruma said there were several development projects to be undertaken in Gampaha such as relocating the police station and constructing a public park. (Yohan Perera and Tilakaratne Dissanayake)

While requesting people to refrain from mutilation, alteration or defacement of Sri Lanka currency notes, the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) advised people to exchange such currency notes from the nearest branch of Licensed Commercial Banks on or before December 31.
The CBSL in a statement said that it had drawn attention of the general public for implementation of its Clean Note Policy and regulation on the willfully mutilation, alteration or defacement of Sri Lanka currency notes.
It said that the Clean Note Policy had been introduced by CBSL aiming at maintaining the quality standards of the currency notes and thereby helping to distinguish between genuine notes and counterfeits.
?It is also expected through this policy to enhance image of the country and promote the efficiency of processing currency notes,? it said.
It said that willfully mutilation, alteration or defacement of Sri Lanka currency notes is an offence under the Monetary Law Act No. 58 of 1949, and is punishable by imprisonment or fine or both.
Under the Regulation E of the Monetary Law Act, no claim in respect of the willfully mutilated or altered notes shall be entertained and such notes shall be retained by CBSL. The holder of these currency notes will have to suffer the loss of face value of such notes.
However, CBSL informed the people that that currency notes that are not willfully mutilated, altered or defaced but damaged due to normal wear and tear during circulation can continue to be exchanged at CBSL and Licensed Commercial Banks as is the current practice.

## Title: Funds dry up for Grand Hyatt Hotel, Colombo

Funds dry up for Grand Hyatt Hotel, Colombo
	
The finances required to complete the controversy-ridden Grand Hyatt hotel in Colombo are not receiving approval, and the government may even end up selling the project?which was built using public retirement funds, at a loss in mid-construction, Mirror Business learns.
A contractor involved in the construction under the condition of anonymity said that construction is now going at a slower pace than before and that discussions have taken place with Canwill Holdings (Pvt) Ltd?the state-owned holding company of the hotel?to further slow down the pace of construction, due to financial difficulties.
Two other contractors, which included one of the six international contractors involved in the project, refused to discuss the situation, noting that the owner of the hotel should be commenting on these matters.
However, attempts to reach Canwill Holdings Chairman Hemaka Amarasuriya, who is also the Chairman of the Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation (SLIC), which is the top shareholder of Canwill Holdings, were unsuccessful.
The government in two successive budgets for the years 2016 and 2017 had said that it would dispose of non-strategic enterprises, including the Grand Hyatt, via the stock market, while the 2018 budget too had mentioned in general that non-strategic state-owned enterprises (SOEs) would be disposed through the stock exchange.
However, just days after the 2018 budget which was read out last month, the government had taken a stance that both the Grand Hyatt and the Colombo Hilton would be divested through the National Agency for Public Private Partnerships (NAPPP) in the Finance Ministry, and that finding partners for these two hotels would be the agency?s top priority.
Mirror Business attempted to reach out to Finance State Minister Eran Wickremaratne multiple times both personally and through his media secretary to request information, but these attempts were unsuccessful.
Several attempts to reach Public Enterprise Development Minister Kabir Hashim also failed.?However, an official at the Public Enterprise Development Ministry?to which Canwill and SLIC belong to?requesting anonymity, said even requests for proposals have not been so far called for the disposal of the hotels.
He said the government might divest the hotel, even at a loss in mid-construction, since government finances are too tight, and are being scrutinized by the International Monetary Fund?which has listed SOE reforms as a key condition under the US$ 1.5 billion extended fund facility Sri Lanka has with the multilateral lender.
The hotel, financed using money from the country?s largest retirement fund, the Employees? Provident Fund, started construction in 2012 to be ready by 2013 for the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting, after the government acquired the hotel in 2012 from the Ceylinco Group after the project had gone through years of dormancy.
Mismanagement of financial resources during the past regime resulted in the hotel, which could have been completed for Rs. 18.5 billion nearly doubling in cost, even after taking into account the more prudent decisions which were taken after the change of government in January 2015.
Around two thirds of the hotel has been completed, and the most crucial question now is what is the best course of action to recover the public money invested in the project?whether to divest now, at a time when publicly listed hotel share prices are struggling, or after completion of the project.
The official meanwhile said that the government has the option of selling off the 100 apartments in the property to finance the remaining construction instead of keeping them as long-stay serviced apartments, although discussions with Grand Hyatt are required to move forward in such a direction.

Getting ready for  impaired vision at 40
	
?
?As you grow older, you are burdened with many worries. Health is one concern. Your fading youth may turn your smile upside down. the appearance of wrinkles in your skin and reduced agility would be your least worries. You will have bigger problems when your eyes slowly lose the ability to see at short distance. This is known as presbyopia, which strikes when people reach their forties. Dr. M. Wijetunge, Retired Consultant Eye Surgeon of the Ragama Teaching Hospital, helps us understand presbyopia.? ?
Presbyopia is a condition that occurs with the ageing. Simply put, presbyopia causes a person to lose the ability to see objects at a short distance. They will only be able to see the object clearly at a further distance. The lenses of the eyes become unable to direct light rays onto the retina from objects located at shorter distances from?the eye.? ?
According to Dr. Wijetunge, when babies are first born and even during 3- 4 months after birth, they are able to see objects placed very close to the eyes. The reason for this is that eyes of babies have a very high focusing power. ?But as a person gets older, the thickness of the lens as well as the curvature of the lens increases. This ultimately reduces the ability to view objects at short distances,? he explained. When the lens thickens and tightens with age, the flexibility of the lens is lost. So the lens becomes unable to focus light rays properly. The ciliary body is a set of muscles that changes the shape of the lens enabling it to direct light rays onto the retina. This is how we are able to see. He stated that with age, the ciliary body loses its ability to change shape of the lens to focus light rays onto the retina from objects located at short distances. This too leads to the inability in viewing short distances clearly.? ?
?
Headaches, laziness to read as well as feeling sleepy when reading are common indications?
of presbyopia
Let?s consider reading a book. When we read a book, we normally place it at a certain distance away from our eyes. But as we get older the distance at which we place the book increases. The eye becomes unable to read a book from a closer distance as the lens cannot focus on light rays. But when the book is held further we are able to read it. This is because there is no need for the eye lens to focus the light rays when a book is read from a distance.? ?
Presbyopia and occupation?
?This condition normally affects a person around age 40 and upwards. Presbyopia is a condition that occurs due to age. Since every single person grows older, everybody will suffer from presbyopia. Some people just don?t realize that they are suffering from presbyopia as they may not be engaged in activities or occupations that require short distance vision,? Dr. Wijetunge mentioned.? ?
?If you are engaged in an occupation that requires short distance viewing, you may realize that you have presbyopia when you reach your forties. But a person in his forties whose occupation doesn?t involve activities that require short distance vision, will not realize that he suffers from presbyopia. ?For example, if you are engaged in a job like sewing clothes, then you might notice that your ability to thread a needle becomes weaker after the age of forty. So you will notice the symptoms of presbyopia and consult a doctor. But if you are in a job that doesn?t require short distance vision, you won?t actually feel the inability to view short distances so you may not face the symptoms. But that does not mean that you don?t suffer from presbyopia. You do. But you don?t suffer the symptoms as you aren?t engaged in activities that require you to see short distances,? he stressed.? ?
Keep your eyes peeled for symptoms? ?
Symptoms may vary from person to person depending on their occupation and daily activities. But there are common symptoms. The most obvious symptom is the inability to see clearly objects at a short distance unless they are held at a further distance. ?Headaches, laziness to read as well as feeling sleepy when reading are common indications of presbyopia,? explained Dr. Wijetunge.? ?
The diagnosis of presbyopia is very easy. It is easily determined by the symptoms and age. Sometimes people below age 40 can experience similar symptoms. This doesn?t necessarily mean that the person is suffering from presbyopia. (Presbyopia before the age of 40 isn?t common, but is possible) ?Sometimes these symptoms can be experienced due to increased eye pressure in the eye or even glaucoma. An eye examination will be conducted to diagnose the condition. But if you are in your forties and suffer from the previously mentioned symptoms, it is quite likely that you suffer from presbyopia,? said the eye surgeon.? ?
A transparent remedy? ?
The only remedy is to wear spectacles. These glasses will usually consist of bifocal lenses. They should be worn during activities where short distance vision is necessary. For example, reading a book. But these glasses don?t have to be worn all the time. With increased age, the presbyopia condition will worsen. Therefore the power of the lens used in the glasses prescribed will also increase.? ?
Presbyopia is a condition that you will have to cope with by using glasses. But Dr. Wijetunge mentioned that there are instances when the condition reverts back enabling short distance vision again. This is due to the increase in the thickening of the eye lens. The refractive index may increase due to this. Thereby the focusing power of the eye will be increased and the ability to view short distances will be restored. He confirmed that presbyopia doesn?t lead to blindness or any complications of the eye.? ?

There is a well-known politico who, whenever sees a little child, would take it into his arms and coddle it.
However, the politico departed from this practice at a public function held recently.
A couple had been keen on taking a picture of their little one in the arms of this politico, but to their disappointment the politico had just sweet-talked to the child without taking it into his arms as usual.
The politico had even turned down a request made by a friend of the couple to take the child into his arms so that he could take a picture.
The politico had later told some people at the ceremony that he wanted to take into his arms that ?sweet little thing?, adding: ?But if the child started crying while in my arms, some would find it good stuff for gossip. Even some newspaper would carry a big story saying that I go round making innocent children cry!?

There are indications that a former purohita reduced to a backbencher is to get a portfolio again, they say.
By the way, two purohitas have vehemently opposed the move afoot to bring back the former colleague back into the top team.
The move to restore the former purohita now down and out to his former status has been initiated following signals that he is to be exonerated from all charges he is facing now, they say. Chances are that the former one is to receive the necessary blessings to preside over foreign affairs at the top team level.

He stayed outside home all night to sign nomination papers
	
A candidate of the forthcoming provincial council election had spent the night in his garden while he waited for the arrival of the auspicious time for him to leave his residence for the signing of the nomination papers on the instructions of an astrologer.
The candidate, who is an ardent believer in horoscopes and working according to auspicious times, consulted an astrologer who attends to the needs of his family and told him that as all the leading politicians of the country have faith in astrology he wanted him to search for an auspicious time for him to sign the nomination papers.
He had boasted about his idea to some of his close friends as well.
The astrologer, who had been very understanding, gave the candidate two auspicious times, one at 1.37 a.m on the day of signing the nomination papers and the other at 8.00 a.m, which he said was the second best time to leave home.
The astrologer had also briefed the candidate about the importance of avoiding the "Rahu Kalaya" or the inauspicious time belts in fixing the correct times and also cautioned him that ignoring these instructions would bring with it malefic effects.
Therefore, the candidate decided on the first time slot as the most auspicious time and rising up in the early hours of the morning he got dressed set out of the house at the preferred auspicious time indicated by the astrologer, which was at 1.37 a.m.
He then proceeded to sit outside in the garden until the time arrived for the election office to open in order for him to go and sign the nomination papers. His actions naturally made it difficult for anyone at home to get any sleep knowing that the candidate was breaking rest just outside the front door.

## Title: High heels,   spasm and back pain
## Section: Medicine

High heels,   spasm and back pain
	
?
Serious health problems can occur when wearing high heels because they force an individual?s ankles to bend forward. Wearing high heels is similar to a person standing on his or her tips of the toes. Wearing high heels restricts blood circulation in your lower limbs. This can lead to spider veins and it can also shorten the muscles in your calves and stiffen your Achilles tendon, leading to pain and muscle spasms.? ?
But the pain doesn?t simply occur in your legs and feet. Heels can also cause back and knee problems. For your body to stay balanced on your heels, your spine needs to sway unnaturally. This adds stress to the muscles in your spine. This results in a sore lower back. High heels are one of the most common causes of foot pain among women. As for your knees, studies reveal that heels, that are 3 1/2 inches or higher, put so much stress on your knees. Such strain could increase a woman?s risk of osteoarthritis, a common chronic condition of the joints which affects approximately 27 million Americans.
Stance
When wearing high-heeled shoes, posture changes in a manner that the back is arched, the pelvis and chest are thrust forward, the buttocks sticks out and the calf muscles tighten. When standing straight without wearing heels, the body creates a 90 degree angle with the floor, which considered to be a normal stance. If the body was a rigid column, putting on a pair of heels would force the entire body to tilt forward and the angle made with the floor would decrease or, in other words, become acute. As the height of the heel increases, this angle would decrease and make the body slant more. However, the body isn?t a rigid column, so in order to wear high-heels and maintain a normal stance, a series of joint adjustments is required. The body?s adjustment to this change in angle creates the classic, curved high-heeled stance.? ?
Upper body
These joint adjustments are a reaction to the way high-heels cause a person?s centre of gravity to shift. As heel height increases, the location of the centre of gravity is elevated. This shift in height causes a rise in potential energy. (The most stable stance for a person is one that minimizes potential energy.) So, as heel height increases, stability decreases. Humans can control their stability by changing their stance and body position. Thus, a woman wearing heels increases the sway of her back to maintain her balance. This added arch in the back then causes the thrust of the chest, pelvis, and posterior.? ?
Lower Body
A person who has long muscular legs will create a huge impact on the lower body if she wears heeled shoes. Such people develop muscularity due to the inclination of the shoe from heel to toe. This slant is the cause of the decrease in angle when in this stance, as previously discussed. As this angle decreases with the height of the heel of the shoe, the slope becomes steeper, so the heel of the foot has to raise more. The Achilles tendon is then forced to shorten, which causes the calf muscles to increasingly flex. Thus, the slant in the shoe causes some muscles of the leg to remain flexed while the added height to the leg gives an illusion of longer legs, both of which are important contributions to the classic heeled shoe stance.? ?
Gait cycle
The alteration in stance induces a change in gait. A normal walking cycle consists of a three-part sequence. The cycle begins with the heel coming into contact with the floor, which is known as contact. The rest of the foot is gradually brought down until it stays flat on the ground, as in a normal stance. This phase is mid-stance. Then the foot progressively rolls pressure towards the ball, so the heel raises up, which is known as push off. These three steps switch back and forth between feet to produce a fairly smooth stride.? ?
Bounce? ?
During normal stance, body weight is spread evenly from the heel and ball of the foot. So, the centre-of-pressure (COP), which is the average location on the foot where most weight is distributed, is located in the middle of the foot. When standing on a heel, the acute angle causes the body?s weight to shift forward, so that the centre of pressure moves toward the ball of the foot. On a high heel, 90% of the weight is focused on the ball of the foot.? ?
When walking in heels, the COP?s location at the ball causes the contact phase to be felt mostly by the ball and the push-off phase is performed almost entirely from the ball. This transforms the smooth step sequence into a more ?jerky? stride. When rolling the ball, there is a smooth transition between different parts of the ball touching the ground, just like shifting between steps of the normal gait cycle. However, when the ball is bounced, one spot is continuously hitting the ground and feeling most of the impact, similar to the ball of the foot in a heeled shoe. Just like the basketball, having the contact phase felt by mostly one section creates a walk with some bounce to it.? ?
Speed? 
?
Each gait cycle in a heeled shoe is faster than cycles in flat ones because of the shift in the centre of gravity. To initiate a walking step, you lean forward until you lose your stability. You begin to fall forward, and you step with one foot to catch your fall and reestablish your stability. Because a shift in centre of gravity makes a person less stable in heels, stability is lost more quickly when walking on high-heels, so you have to ?catch your falls?, or take steps, more often. Research at Sungkyunkwan University?s School of Mechanical Engineering revealed that the period of one gait cycle is cut in half when? wearing high-heels instead of flat shoes. More gait cycles are covered in a given distance, so someone walking in heels has very quick steps that cover a short distance.? ?
Sway
Aside from the quick, bouncy steps, the supermodel walk needs showy hip swaying, better known as a sashay. Once again, the shift in centre of gravity is the main cause of this action. Pelvis and hip movement contributes greatly to maintaining balance and standing posture by exerting continuous muscular action to ensure equilibrium. When walking on heels, the muscular action taken is turning the hips and pelvic region more, scientifically known as torque.? ?
That?s all there is to it - the classic strut down the catwalk is basically the body trying to keep itself balanced. The hip swaying, swift bouncy strides and prominent stance are all in reaction to a shift in centres of gravity or pressure. The illusion of muscular legs, on the other hand, is a result of positioning of the heel of the foot.? ?
Negative effects
Much work has to be put into wearing heeled shoes, which makes the attraction of wearing them not so appealing to the body. The arched back brought on by the heeled shoe alters the positions and angles at which joints are allowed to move. The pelvic and abdominal organs must adapt to these positions, which puts strain on the body. The high amount of pressure focused on the ball of the foot adds stress to the ball. Even the heel experiences strain. When walking in four inch heels, the force on the heel of the foot is equivalent to the force felt when running. The way the heel creates the look of long, muscular legs actually takes away from the propulsive power of tendon and leg muscles.? ?
If you?re experiencing any of these issues, it?s important to visit a physician as well as a physiotherapist before they get worse. To prevent these issues from occurring, try to decrease the amount of days you wear heels ? or change into flats or walking shoes when you leave work.? ?
At the end of each day, spend a few minutes stretching your quads, calves and hip flexors with your physical therapist. Fashion doesn?t have to be synonymous with pain.? ?

Malaysian firm proposes investment plan to revive national airlines
	
Amid speculations of closure and employees writing to Chairman Ajith Dias that they did not have confidence in him as well as the top management of the ailing national carrier SriLankan Airlines, a leading Malaysian company has come forward with an investment proposal to revive the national airlines, Daily Mirror learns.
The significance of the investment proposal of Super Group Holdings Pvt. Ltd. of Malaysia is its consent to reactivate the now defunct regional airline of the country, Mihin Air.
An authoritative source told Daily Mirror on condition of anonymity that Super Group Holdings had suggested to run SriLankan as a low-cost carrier with available resources within the airline and is keen on substantial investment. The proposal had already been forwarded for review to the Economic Committee chaired by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.
?The proposals also include operating SriLankan Airlines as an international as well as regional low-cost carrier and Mihin Lanka as a regional and domestic carrier utilising the entire network now in use. All domestic airports such as Ratmalana, Palali in Jaffna, Trincomalee, Koggala and Anuradhapura will be refurbished and upgraded under the proposed programme in addition to international airports of Bandaranaike and Mattala International Airports. It is quite possible that Mihin Lanka will be re-branded and used as a low-cost carrier to cater to the South Asian region and the Indian Sub Continent in a concept of ?City-to-City? project,? he said.
The certificate already issued to Mihin Lanka by the International Civil Airlines Organisation (ICAO) will be used for the new project.
The investors are glad that the Cabinet has decided to absorb the debts of Mihin Air (on November 5, 2017) and that is why they have consented to restore Mihin Lanka that had been facing liquidation while ceasing operations in October.
Super Group Holdings is a multi-national company involved in tourism, hotel management and airlines based in Kuala Lumpur.
The source added that however, the discussions are continuing with several other investors and airlines to run SriLankan Airlines as a Public Private Partnership (PPP). (Sandun A. Jayasekera)

Marital rape to be a punishable offence
	
Amendments will be introduced to the Penal Code shortly to make marital rape a crime and a punishable offence and cabinet approval has been granted to a proposal made in this respect by Justice and Foreign Employment Minister Talatha Atukorale.
Marital rape is the act of sexual intercourse with one's wife without her consent. It is a form of domestic violence and sexual abuse. Although, historically, sexual intercourse within marriage was regarded as a right of the husband, engaging in the act without the spouse's consent is now widely recognized by law and society as wrong and as a crime, a senior source of the Justice Ministry said.
?It is recognized all over the world that sexual intercourse even with the legal wife without her consent is a crime. Our objective is to give the opportunity to a woman to take legal action against her own husband who has raped her. Sri Lanka?s Penal Code does not recognize this offence as a punishable offence now thought it is also a domestic violence,? she added.
She pointed out that women in Sri Lanka in many instances are reluctant to lodge a complaint with the Police against her husband though she becomes a victim of domestic violence and rape based on religious, cultural, social and family values. But some legal measures are required to arrest this negative trend which is on the rise, she stressed.
She also said making marital rape a crime is also a condition laid by the EU to withdraw the ban of the GSP+ on Sri Lanka.
To amend the clause 362 A of the Penal Code for the purpose has been referred by the cabinet to the Legal Draftsman and the law will be in place in the first half of 2018, she said. (Sandun A Jayasekera)

New currency notes to mark independence, says PM
	
Several denominations of new currency notes are to be issued to mark the 70th anniversary of Sri Lanka?s independence next year, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said yesterday.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe revealed this during his visit to De La Ru Lanka Currency and Security Print (Private Ltd) in Biyagama yesterday. The company holds the rights to print currency for the Government of Sri Lanka as well as several foreign governments.
?You were denied access to the premises of this company because several new bank notes that are to be issued to mark the 70th anniversary of Sri Lanka?s independence are being printed here. In addition this company prints currency for countries such as Ghana and Venezuela. These processes are confident which is why the media is not allowed inside,? the Prime Minister told journalists after his visit to the company situated in the Biyagama Export Processing Zone last evening.
He said the company will also start printing passports in a few months time. Cutting edge microchip technology is to be used for the new look passport that is to be printed by them. ?This company has been entrusted with the task of printing the new Sri Lankan passport in few months time. Microchip technology will be used for the new passport. It will contain the fingerprints and other details of the passport holder. This company first came to Sri Lanka in order to print currency but it has now diversified its portfolio of activities. The company might get contracts to print foreign passports as well,?

nutrition zone  Let?s sort out this  problem  with   breakfast!
	
Breakfast is the meal that gives us a ?kick start? to our day, providing us with the energy and nutrients. But are we giving breakfast the respect it deserves, especially with regard to growing children? The answer of researchers and the medical professionals to this question is a resounding ?NO?. According to research one in every three Sri Lankan children doesn?t have a proper breakfast. So, in today?s Health Capsule we are exploring on how to rethink our breakfast, on behalf of our readers.? ?
Unlike in the past, when at least one parent stayed at home and children attended schools which were a walking distance from their residences, most of us are busy with the never-ending race to succeed in life. Parents don?t have time to prepare a sufficient breakfast, a meal which the older generation refer to as a preparation fit for a king. And on the other hand children are also too busy to have a sufficient meal in the morning. So with regard to most present day children, breakfast consists of a glass of milk and a short eat (Junk food) hastily forced on them. Is this healthy for kids? We contacted Dr. Renuka Jayatissa, Consultant Medical Nutritionist at the Medical Research Institute and the President of the Sri Lanka Medical Nutrition Association, to obtain more information on the topic.??
?
The first meal?of the day
?While all three meals of the day are important, breakfast is even more special. This is because it?s the first meal for the day which is taken after a long fast. This is why this meal must offer protein, vitamins and minerals,? explained Dr. Jayatissa.? ?
With regard to children, it?s even more so, because their bodies are still growing. The nutrient components in breakfast will aid their muscles and bones grow. This is vital for achieving the optimum height in relation to age, she explained.? ?
Breakfast is important not only for physical growth, but also for mental development as well, said the doctor. ?Studies have shown that breakfast affects a child?s concentration and memory at school. Students who did not have a proper breakfast fared poorly when in aspects? like mathematical skills and the performance at competitive exams when compared with their peers,? she explained.? ?
In addition, such children have poorer immune systems, making them more susceptible to diseases. Even children from families with good socio economic status are suffering from diseases like malnutrition and anaemia, largely due to the lack of a proper breakfast, Dr. Jayatissa continued.? ?
Skipping breakfast will not only reduce your child?s school performances, but it is also likely to affect your child negatively in the future. Dr. Jayatissa spoke extensively on the large scale research which has revealed that skipping breakfast increases the risk of heart diseases in old age.? ?
Is preparing a?nutritious breakfast a hard task???
?With the parents having a busy day juggling family and jobs, the easier option seems to be buying children a bun or a sandwich from the pastry shop, rather than taking the hassle to prepare breakfast in the morning. But does it have to be so?? ?
Despite the myths, a nutritious breakfast doesn?t have to be an elaborate affair. Fruits and a yogurt, for example can be considered a good example for a healthy breakfast. According to the doctor an ideal breakfast should be rich in proteins, have vitamins and minerals and provide an adequate amount of carbohydrate and fats. Another way to prepare a nutritious breakfast is to add two parts fruits and vegetables, one part fats and one part carbohydrate to the meal. This leaves the parents a wide margin to assemble a quick nutritious breakfast whilst being creative so as to tempt the taste buds, may it be cereals and fruits, boiled cow peas with scraped coconut and ?lunu miris?, an egg and string hoppers with ?pol sambol? or some ?habala pethi? with fruits or nuts. Vegetables again don?t have to be expensive and elaborate, instead may consist of cheap and easy to find things like ?kesel muwa? and some green leaves.
?
We do everything that we do for the future betterment and the happiness of our children
?
A glass of milk only doesn?t suffice??
??Most children today travel for longer periods to reach school. This leaves them with less time to concentrate on having a proper meal in the morning. So they skip breakfast, opting for a glass of milk,? stated Dr. Jayatissa. This is even more unhealthy because in addition to the adverse effects from the skipped breakfast, it result in them developing hunger pangs as early as 9.30 or 10.00 am. The easiest unhealthy option is to have short eats and sugary drinks. These meals contain unhealthy carbohydrates and fats in abundance. This will again give rise to long- term consequences like obesity, fatty liver, diabetes and ischemic heart diseases at a very young age.? ?
?A glass of milk has only a few components of nutrients essential for a kid. By giving it in the morning, it leaves the child full and unable to have breakfast. So give the child breakfast in the morning and postpone the glass of milk until evening tea when the child is back from school, which leaves plenty of time until dinner to digest the milk,? she advised.? ?

Message to parents?
? Before concluding the interview, Dr. Jayatissa left a message to our readers who are parents of?young children.? ?
??We do everything that we do for the future betterment and the happiness of our children. But in the process, we tend to forget some very important areas that have a major impact on their future, like their nutritional needs. Rather than filling the child?s lunch box with a pastry or a packet of biscuits, it?s time to rethink our children?s meals. This will help in their studies as well as help them to maintain good health throughout their adulthood, which in the end, is every parent?s dream?.?

## Title: Plain of Mars - The Quadrangle and the Great Triangle
## Section: Jyotisha News

Plain of Mars - The Quadrangle and the Great Triangle
	
A clue to read one?s? ?temperament?
?
?
The area of the hollow or the depression in the centre of the palm is called the Plain of Mars.
The Plain of Mars is made up of two parts called the Quadrangle and the Great Triangle. The space lying between the lines of Heart and Head is called the Quadrangle. This area extends from the Mount of Jupiter to the Mount of Upper Mars, neither Mount included. The Great Triangle is the space bounded by the lines of Head, Life and Health.
Renowned palmists like Comto C de Saint - Germain, a disciple of the celebrated palmist Adolphe Desbarroles and Cheiro have dealt with the characteristics of the Quadrangle and the Great Triangle separately for the purpose of delineating the character of the subject and making predictions.
The normal Great Triangle is the area lying between the Life line, Head line and the Health or Liver line. There would be no clearly marked Triangle in the absence of any of these three lines. In such a case, the signs located in that portion of the palm that would normally cover the space of the Triangle are to be read as if they are within?the Triangle.
?
The main characteristics of the Great Triangle and their indications are as follows:
(1) Bulging in both hands: Aggressive temperament and prodigal disposition.
(2) Bulging in one hand only: Brave and generous.
(3) Broad and well formed with the three lines distinct: The subject is kind and benevolent.
(4) Wide and distinct with healthy three lines: Demonstrates good understanding. A healthy liver helps the brain to function efficiently.
(5) Very large with well- developed Mounts of Mars: Aggressive and audacious.
(6) A small Great Triangle: Mean and cowardly.
(7) Flat in both hands with a low Mount of Saturn: Leading an insignificant life.
(8) Much lined and exaggerated Mounts of Mercury and Mars: Impatient, fretful and easily provoked.
(9) Well formed with Heart Line forked at its termination: Generous.
(10) The Great Triangle in the hand of a person with Fate and Sin lines absent: Not suitable for an artistic or an intellectual career.
?
The main characteristics of the Quadrangle and their indications:
(1) Well- formed and wider towards percussion: Very straightforward.
(2) Very wide from one end to the other: Very obstinate to the extent of being foolish.
This characteristic presupposes the Heart Line running too high indicating jealousy and sensuality and the Head line running too low pointing to ill-balanced reasoning power.
(3) Narrow due to Head line rising toward the Heart line: Narrow minded. Feelings dominate over reason.
(4) Narrow due to the Heart line stooping towards the Head line: Mean and illiberal. Cold-hearted.
(5) Bulging and well- shaped: Greedy for money, but spends it generously.
(6) Wide with a good Head line and a well formed second phalanx of the Thumb: Broad-minded, reasonable and intelligent.
(7) Narrow with a poor line of Health: Prone to asthma and hay-fever.
(8) A cross in the Quadrangle touching the Head line: Dominates the other person in love and friendship.
(9) A cross in the Quadrangle touching the heart line: The subject will come under the influence of the opposite sex.
(10) Square in a normally shaped quadrangle: Quick temper, but kind-hearted.

Russian tea ban; insect detection an isolated incident-SL
	
The Sri Lanka Tea Board said today that the detection of an insect which led to the temporary ban of Ceylon Tea imports into Russia may have been an isolated incident, and that Plantation Industries Minister Navin Dissanayake would visit Russia to clear the situation.
This Thursday, the Russian Federation banned tea imports from Sri Lanka, to take into effect from, due to the detection of a single specimen of the agricultural pest, the beetle Trogoderma granarium in the packaging material of a consignment of tea shipped from Sri Lanka.
?We believe the present case is an isolated incident that is, in any case, not a reflection on the quality of Ceylon Tea,? the Sri Lanka Tea Board said in a statement.
It noted that the beetle is a pest of grain crops such as rice, and has never been associated with tea.
?The Sri Lanka Tea Board is of the view that the specimen discovered in the packaging material may have remained in the shipping container concerned following the use of this container for the transport of grain on a previous occasion, not necessarily of Sri Lankan origin,? the statement said.
The Sri Lanka Tea Board said that nevertheless, it is anxious to protect the standards and quality for which Ceylon Tea is renowned worldwide and is working with tea producers and exporters to ensure that phytosanitary and other standards are rigorously followed in all shipments of tea originating in Sri Lanka.
The state institution assured that the Russian authorities have made it explicitly clear that the ban is of a temporary nature and would last only until the completion of negotiations and clarification of the situation with the competent authority of Sri Lanka.
?Accordingly, the Minister of Plantation Industries, Navin Dissanayake, will visit Russia as soon as the necessary logistical arrangements are made and work with his Russian counterparts to resolve this problem,? the Sri Lanka Tea Board said.
It added that it, along with the Ministry of Plantation Industries wasworking very closely with all the relevant agencies of government, including the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Department of Commerce to restore normal trade between the two countries as soon as possible.
Russia was the second largest tea market for Sri Lanka in 2016 after Iran. Russia imported US$ 143 million worth of Ceylon Tea, which was 11.3 percent of Sri Lanka?s tea exports.

?Social media? useful evil to the student
	
Today the world is a global village. As said by Marshal McLuhan, a philosopher of communication theory, ?The new electronic independence re-creates the world in the image of a global village.? This electronic independence dependent on the internet and social media.? ?
Social media is a collective of online communications channels dedicated to community based input, interaction, content sharing and collaboration.? ?
Face book, Instagram, twitter, WhatsApp are commonly use social media in the world. These social media is a great way to make communication and build one?s personal brand. Now a day?s social media play a significant role in our day today life.? ?
?
As a student?s we mostly spend our time with social media. Why do students love to spend time with socializing? Because social media networks provide them the freedom to do whatever they want like upload what they want to talk to whom they need. They like to make new friends and comment to the lives of different people. Meanwhile, a student can create a fake identity that the real world does not allow. Learning is a major task in a student?s life. They can collect more information through the social media. It is useful to improve?their knowledge.? ?
Why do students love to spend time with socializing? Because social media networks provide them the freedom to do whatever they want like upload what they want to talk to whom they need. They like to make new friends and comment to the lives of different people
But the social media like over other thing has benefits and down side social media addiction. Addiction is very harmful to students. Students prefer to chat with friends for hours, and this leads to a waste of time which could have used for studying, playing or learning new skills. Many people specially the students feel lonely as a result of social media. They are unable to depend on their original thoughts thinking that the views of others have more value than theirs. Youths are very daring and will try to imitate everything they see on these social networks. The result is dangerous and might bring out unacceptable habits and practices to use drugs.? ?
Which social medium is similar to a knife, which is very sharp now a day?s. We can use this knife to cut fruits or neck. Now you can decide how to use this sharpened knife, ?the social media?? ?

## Title: Tabs for students and teachers did successful bidder violate tenderprocedure?

Tabs for students and teachers did successful bidder violate tenderprocedure?
	
High officials at the Ministry of Education are alleged to have been involved in awarding a tender to a bidder to purchase computer tabs despite the bidder not meeting the tender requirements at the time the tender was opened.?
?
Eyebrows have been raised at the manner in which the tender was awarded to the bidder whose application had not been recommended by the Standing Cabinet Appointed Procurement Committee (SCAPC) for not meeting essential tender requirements. However the bidder had been recommended by the Procurement Appeal Board.? ?
The? is in possession of documental proof pertaining to the computer tab procurement and information regarding the latest document signed by Chairman Procurement Appeal Board K.A.S. Gunasekera and its members Lalith R. de Silva and A.D.S. Gunawardena, sending Procurement Appeal Board recommendations to the Cabinet of Ministers.? ?
?
The recommendation letter further states, ?The Procurement Appeal Board recommends the Cabinet of Ministers to set aside the recommendation by the Standing Cabinet Appoint Procurement Committee to award this tender to M/s Metropolitan Computers (Pvt) Ltd and to award the tender to (name withheld) who have submitted the lowest bid on this tender and proved that they have fulfilled all major conditions of the tender?.? ?
?
Although the principal mandate of the Ministry of Education is to? formulate appropriate policies and monitor their implementation and delivery of quality education for all, it?s now learned how the top officials at the Ministry of Education (MoE) had failed to focus on their main duties. These duties are the formulation of policies, carrying out research and the monitoring and evaluations of educational delivery.?
And they are accused of allegedly getting involved in bypassing Government procurement guidelines.? ?
Despite SCAPC?s recommendation to purchase health safety computer tabs for Advance Level students and teachers, questions have been raised as to on whose direction the Procurement Appeal Board recommended the Cabinet of Ministers to award the tender to the bidder who had quoted a lower price, but did not meet the tender requirement?
?
The tender was opened on August 22, 2017. The selected bidder is alleged to have obtained the world acclaimed certification - the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) product certification- that guarantees health safeties of those who use these devices only after the tenders were opened.? ?
?
Non ionizing radio frequencies
?How can the MoE allow bidders to fulfill tender requirements after the tenders were opened? Why was only a selected bidder given this opportunity? The members of the SCAPC recommended Metropolitan Computers (Pvt) Ltd to be awarded the tender as their quoted ?Acer? brand had fulfilled all the tender requirements, specially the world acclaimed FCC product certification. This is the most important factor SCAPC considered rather than the quoted prices.
?
Consideration was on health safeties as these tabs are to be given to schoolchildren. According to World Health Organization the wireless devices emit non ionizing radio frequencies which pose a possible cancer risk. It?s also said that these radio frequencies decrease human sperm motility and increase sperm DNA fragmentation. That was why the FCC product certification was required in the tender document,? a reliable high official at the MoE said.? ?
As a pledge given by the Government, Rs. 5 billion had been allocated from the 2017 Budget to purchase 159, 078 Computer Tabs for A/L students while another 36, 070 tabs are to be purchased to be given away to teachers.
?
Tenders were called in early this year and although many prospective bidders had taken part in the pre-bidding meetings only a few had forwarded their bids. Out of them only a few had been selected by the Technical Evaluation Committee (TEC). This committee had decided to offer the tender to the highest bidder amongst the selected parties considering the fulfillment of the tender requirements.?
?
By letter dated October 12, 2017 and sent to all bidders, Additional Secretary (Procurement) Anuradha Wijekoon had stated that on the recommendation of the TEC, a decision had been taken to offer the tender to Metropolitan Computers Pvt Ltd of 85, Braybrook Place Colombo as per Section 8.2.1 of Government Procurement Guidelines and to send appeals if any against the decision taken by the TEC.? ?
?All good efforts made by the TEC were in vain following the request made to bidders to appeal if they opposed the decision in awarding the tender to Metropolitan Computers,? sources said.? ?
Suitable in?non-tropical areas? ?
Be that as it may, when browsing through the user manual of the brand that had been selected by the Procurement Appeal Board, it was revealed that this production is suitable for use in non-tropical areas and that the device is not recommended to be used long term in any environment where the air is too cold, too hot, too humid or one that contains too much dust.?
?
?Sri Lanka is a tropical country and how can the students use these devices unless they operate them in an A/C room,? sources queried.? ?
According to sources who wished to remain anonymous, the ministry higher officials, although attempting to manipulate the TEC/SCAPC recommendation from the inception, in order to offer the tender to one of their ?favourities? since the bidder failed to fulfill the tender requirements, the TEC had stood firm with its decision.??
?
Failing to influence the TEC members, by letter dated July 12, 2017, Secretary Education Ministry (Ref:ED/07/101/10/PRO/CAPC/2017) had made a request to the Department of Public Finance to appoint new members to the TEC. By letter dated July 24, 2017, Director General Department of Public Finance P. Algama in his reply to Secretary Ministry of Education has claimed that the request made by the Secretary to replace the TEC with new members would create a negative impact on the credibility and transparency of the Government procurement procedure.? ?
?
The letter further states, ?For the procurement of free tabs for teachers and students in A Level classes, I have already appointed seven members to the TEC by letter dated March 3, 2017, and without giving any reasons you have made a request to null and void the appointed TEC.? ?
?The TEC had already followed the procurement guidelines and had called for tenders. Hence to remove the members of the TEC at this juncture, shall bring negative impact on the credibility and transparency of the Government procurement procedure. If you need to strengthen the TEC, he could consider to appoint more members to the committee.? ?
?
?The entire staff at the MoE hails the TEC for being very stern in recommending the best brand to be purchased for our future generation without putting their lives at risk. What was the reason for the Education Ministry to request from the Department of Public Finance to remove the TEC at a later stage instead of making the request before tenders were advertised?? sources alleged.??
?
According to the sources, merely because there was a bidder who had quoted the lowest price, the TEC didn?t want to offer the tender as they didn?t comply with the FCC product certification requirement. ?The bidder in question instead had submitted the FCC certification only after the tender was closed.
?
Initially this bidder submitted an incorrect FCC product certificate and referred to a model different from the one that was offered in the tender. Submitting another FCC product certification at the time the appeal was made after the tenders were closed violates the tender guidelines. No evaluation has been conducted on account of this bid being non responsive on the evaluation conducted initially and this particular brand doesn?t comply with the tender requirement,? sources added.? ?
The sources further said it had come to light that most of the bidders had submitted the FCC declaration of conformity instead of a FCC product certification. If one logs on to the FCC website any FCC certified product could be verified. ?Although the European certification and FCC product certification requirement was mentioned in the tender document, research has revealed that radio frequency (RF) radiation from personal computers and Tabs that aren?t certified pose serious health risks as these devices by nature are used for long hours in close proximity to the skin and most of the time is kept on the laps of users.
?
In such a backdrop what made the Education Ministry official to award the tender to the bidder that doesn?t have the FCC product certification,? sources queried.? ?
?
The sources meanwhile accused the Telecommunications Regulatory Commission (TRC) of Sri Lanka for accepting European Certification (CE) or FCC to grant approval to import computer tabs, as it is questionable why the TRC has failed to stop the usage of non FCC product certificated electronic devises in the country. Deputy Director TRC by letter dated September 21, 2017 had stated that they accept either EC or FCC certification.? ?
?Now the bidders claim the TRC accepts FCC or CE certifications. Although the TRC letter to the Education Ministry claims that they accept FCC and EC certification, TRC website clearly explains what the mandate of the TRC is. It says that although it is the regulatory body to manage and control the use of the radio frequency spectrum, they are not the regulator on health and safety standards.
?
The MoE can?t accept only the letter written to them by the TRC, but should know how to consider the health and safety of these devices as well,? sources claimed.? ?
When contacted Managing Director Metropolitan Computers, Ivor Maharoof he declined to talked to this paper. ?Sorry I can?t make any comment in this regard,? Maharoof said.? ?

The town councils, provincial councils and mega town councils hold major importance and are closer to the people than other political institutions that wield authority. Especially our citizens involved in policy making directly interfere with the activities of theses political institutions. These institutions provide many services to the country?s citizens. Some of these services are supplying water, constructing roads, maintaining playgrounds, administrating primary schools, clearing of garbage apart form collecting tax. These institutes also protect and maintain the environment.?
Have the Government authorities done their job here ?

But sadly there have been occasions when the local authorities have avoided their duties. There have also been occasions when these institutes have failed to provide solutions to pollution. Most of these irregularities are linked to people with inadequate educational qualifications assigned to certain posts.?
We need politicians who can spend their own money on election campaigns.?
We must also have a close watch over politicians who become rich overnight. We must check whether they have fulfilled their obligations towards the people.

This election is of special significance: MR
	
Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa yesterday requested voters to cast their ballots at the upcoming local government elections on the basis of whether they are in favour of the UNP-SLFP government or opposed to it.
?I earnestly request the voting public to set aside all other considerations and to cast their vote at the forthcoming local government elections solely on the basis of being either in favour of, or opposed to, the present UNP-SLFP coalition government, ?he said.
He said, ?Nominations have now been accepted for the local government elections which had been delayed by nearly three years due to the government?s fear of losing. Even though a local government election is not an election at which political power changes hands, this election is of special significance because this is the first time the people will have an opportunity to use the ballot to demonstrate their opposition to the present government. The only election held previously under the so called 'yahapalana' government was the parliamentary election of August 2015. The incumbent President ensured the victory of the UNP at that election by issuing public statements to destabilise the UPFA election campaign and by sacking the general secretaries of the SLFP and the UPFA on the eve of the poll, thereby sending the message that since it is the President who calls the shots, the UNP will ultimately end up triumphant even if they lose the election.
That was the manner in which the present leader of the SLFP ensured the victory of the UNP at the last parliamentary election. This is why the Joint Opposition is contesting this local government election under a different symbol and a different political alliance. The objective of the joint opposition is to provide all those opposed to this government with a political alternative. Even though the SLFP group in the government criticizes the UNP, they serve in the same Cabinet and cooperate in all matters necessary to keep the coalition government going. SLFP ministers vote every year for the UNP?s Budget. The whole country saw the manner in which the SLFP group in the government voted in favour of the 2018 Budget just a few days ago. We see the two sides cooperating with one another in selling off our national assets as well. When the UNP minister of ports and shipping objected to the Hambantota port deal, the President removed him and appointed an SLFP minister to that position to push through the unfavourable deal entered into by the UNP. When the Hambantota Port was handed over to a foreign company recently, the whole country saw how the SLFP ministers present applauded as the Prime Minister hugged the cheque for 292 million USD,?the former President said.

## Title: Toxic Tobacco   Let?s drop the   smoking habit !
## Section: Medicine

Toxic Tobacco   Let?s drop the   smoking habit !
	
Regardless of how well you understand the outcomes of tobacco use, you still see a considerable number of cigarette smokers almost everywhere you go. Earlier this year, the Youth Tobacco report compiled by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), slotted Sri Lanka as the country with the lowest prevalence of teen smoking which amounts to 1.7%. The report however cautioned that ?young people who begin to smoke at an earlier age are more likely than those who start at older ages to develop long-term?nicotine addiction.?? ?
As tobacco use is responsible for a significant number of deaths each year and impacts the health of every member of our society, it is imperative to discuss how and why adolescents drift towards the consumption of tobacco. Consultant Child and Adolescent Psychiatrist at the Karapitiya Teaching Hospital, Galle, Dr. Udena Attygalle joins this week?s edition of Health Capsule factors, as we attempt to demystify the psychological factors, associated with?tobacco use.? ?
According to Dr. Attygalle, the chemical changes in the brain caused by tobacco smoking are a complex process. ?Exposure to nicotine changes the way your brain functions. The balance of certain chemicals, in your brain starts to change. This change causes you to want more of nicotine which in turn can later cause addiction,? he said.? ?
Age of curiosity
Even though many people are aware of how the use of tobacco can harm the body, less people are aware of how and why tobacco addiction works. According to Dr. Attygalle, it isn?t easy to specify or label these reasons as to why each smoker will take to using tobacco.? ?Young people just experiment with a lot of things. Most of them choose tobacco as it is easily available. Most of these youngsters who experiment don?t end up becoming chain smokers. But for some the vulnerability is more,? Dr. Attygalle noted. ?Some individuals have a genetic vulnerability to become addicted to tobacco. However the majority of youngsters are known to experiment with many substances and not just?tobacco alone.?? ?
Recent research also seems to echo this theory. According to a study conducted by researchers from University of Michigan, a previously dismissed genetic mechanism has been found responsible for nicotine dependence. Their research findings show that specific genes and micro RNA (a type of small RNA molecules that help refine gene expression) play a vital role in determining how nicotine dependence and withdrawal responses are developed.? ?
Responding to the question of tobacco acting as a gateway drug encouraging youth to gamble into the use of other drugs, Dr. Attygalle said this is a theory which has been debated over the years. ?For example, some believe that Cannabis can act as a gateway drug rather than tobacco. However it?s important to note that people who are addicted to other substances are usually smokers of tobacco. For instance someone who is addicted to alcohol is more likely to smoke tobacco as well,? he added.
Asked if the use of tobacco can affect the mental growth and overall mental health of adolescents, Dr. Attygalle said that a number of factors should be weighed with regard to the growth of a teenager?s brain. ?It is not necessarily the case that the use of tobacco would affect the mental growth of teenagers. But the adolescent brain is still undergoing changes. Any substance-not just tobacco-can cause changes in the brain. It has been established that the use of cannabis causes fundamental changes in brain circuitry and it can have repercussions later on,? explained Dr. Attygalle.?
What is Tobacco?
Tobacco is found in many different forms, including cigarettes, cigars, pipe tobacco, snuff, and chewing tobacco. It contains the addictive drug nicotine (also found in e-cigarettes).? ?
?
What is Nicotine?
?
Nicotine, a highly addictive stimulant, is absorbed into the bloodstream when tobacco or nicotine products are chewed, inhalled, or smoked.? ?
?
?
Behavioural changes
Speaking of suspected behavioural changes caused by tobacco consumption, Dr. Attygalle believes it is important to monitor the overall behaviour of adolescents.? ?
?Often there?s an underlying factor-besides the addiction to nicotine-that drives teenagers to pick up the habit of smoking in the first instance. A craving for smoking will develop due to dependence. If a smoker doesn?t get enough nicotine, they become anxious and crave for nicotine. That could be one sign,? he said.?
?Most children smoke to feel good, or due to pressure from peer groups or even to reduce stress. Being aware of your child?s behaviour in general, rather than looking for behavioural clues associated with smoking is what we should focus on. Concentrating on the reasons as to why they are smoking rather than looking out for behavioural changes is advisable,??Dr. Attygalle explained.
According to Dr. Attygalle, those suffering from certain illnesses such as depression or anxiety are more inclined towards smoking tobacco. ?Since tobacco is freely available, if someone is feeling anxious or depressed, they will find a temporary relief from nicotine. In addition to these illnesses, those with illnesses such as schizophrenia are more likely to smoke as they will seek relief from their symptoms,? he further added.? ?
Ways to quit
Stopping smoking is easier said than done, according to many who have attempted to quit the habit. ?This depends on how addicted a person is to smoking,? said Dr. Attygalle. ?If it is a chain smoker, they can?t get rid of this habit easily. For young people, they need to develop and understand the threats of tobacco use for which there are many effective campaigns carried out. It?s also important that they develop social skills and life skills. Being confident enough to resist the urge to smoke is the kind of skill which needs to be inculcated in youth.? ?
?When it comes to peer pressure, they have to build confidence in knowing how to say no. Their assertiveness and ability to advocate for non-smokers are vital aspects of this process. In this regard both parents and teachers have equal responsibility to educate their children,? he added.? ?
Dr. Attygalle didn?t fail to highlight the importance of building these values in young minds. ?Adolescents usually act as agents of change. If one adolescent is capable of changing another peer, it has a kind of a ripple effect,? Dr. Attygalle underscored.? ?
?For serious addiction, you need to seek help from adults. There are various models of breaking free from addiction. There are medications available as well as support programmes designed to help those who need to quit smoking.? ?
Despite increasing evidence that tobacco use is detrimental not only to your physical health, but also to your mental health, people don?t seem to heed any of these warnings.? ?
?There are various reasons connected with the use of tobacco. If your social circumstances are falling apart, you are more likely to start depending on smoking. This isn?t a direct connection, but there are countless issues associated with smoking. For instance, if someone has to continue with smoking, it affects his or her life. This can in turn lead to depression, anxiety and other illnesses. Not just tobacco, but any form of substance abuse can cause a significant change in one?s life,? Dr. Attygalle said highlighting the importance of understanding the risks associated with the toxic tobacco.?

UN experts calls for end to arbitrary detention in SL
	
The three-member UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention which was in Sri Lanka from December 4, today urged the government to introduce urgent reforms to the 'outdated' legal framework to end arbitrary detention in the country.
The delegation comprised Working Group Members Jos? Antonio Guevara Berm?dez, Leigh Toomey and Elina Steinerte.
They called for urgent reforms to address problems including the excessive use of remand, a lack of effective alternatives to detention, an outdated legal framework and reliance on confessions often extracted under torture or duress.
The experts said further urgent action was required to give effect to Sri Lanka?s obligations under international human rights law, as well as the commitments made by the Government in its Human Rights National Action Plan 2017-2021.
?The right to personal liberty has yet to be respected by law enforcement, security forces, judicial and other authorities,? the experts said in a statement, at the end of their visit to the country.
They said court proceedings were affected by excessive and unjustified delays, while suspects remained in detention indefinitely, adding that the rights to the presumption of innocence and due process were yet to be fully recognized.
The experts urged Sri Lanka to repeal the Prevention of Terrorism Act of 1979, which they said was one of the key enablers of arbitrary detention for over four decades.
The experts also paid particular attention to the deprivation of liberty of those in situations of vulnerability, such as children, women, elderly people, those with psychosocial disabilities, and those living in poverty.
?Despite identifying positive practices in this regard, it is concerning that the legal basis and procedures for depriving people of their liberty are not clearly established. There are no effective safeguards against arbitrariness in this context and there is an urgent need to strengthen mechanisms for independent monitoring and oversight,? the experts said.
They will present the final report on its visit to the United Nations Human Rights Council in September next year. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Wife?s craze for sarees saved his face!
	
A politico at national level had got highly excited over a prediction by an astrologer that a high political office was in the offing for him.?
And he had decided that he should seek the divine blessings to ensure the prediction come true at the earliest possible instead of passively waiting for it to happen in an uncertain future. So he quietly visited a popular Kovil in a neighboring country to offer a special pooja seeking divine intervention for the prediction to materialize with the least delay.
Before leaving the ambitious politico had casually mentioned to a colleague that he was planning to go abroad without giving an inkling of the purpose of his intended visit.
On arrival at the Kovil the politico had the biggest ever unpleasant surprise in his life when he suddenly came face to face with his colleague there.
However, quite used to play-acting, the politico had immediately covered up his confusion with a cleverly contrived show of his pleasure at meeting him. ?Don?t you know, Machang, my wife is crazy about new and varied sarees. So after doing some shopping, I thought of visiting this place by the way,? he had told his friend.
Cursing the colleague under breath for spoiling his plan for the day, the politico had soon left the Kovil premises.
However, he had returned to the Kovil the following day and conducted the special pooja and observed all other rites happily, assured that there was no unwelcome familiar face anywhere near or in the Kovil premises, sources close to him said.
