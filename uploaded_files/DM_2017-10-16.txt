A landmark shift in insurers financial reporting: EY
	
The International Accounting Standard Board (IASB) issued a new insurance contracts standard, International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) 17 Insurance Contracts. Ernst & Young (EY) finds that this will trigger a landmark shift in the financial reporting of insurers under IFRS and Sri Lanka Standards and marks a fundamental change to the current practice across the industry.
The IASBs objective in introducing the new standard is to increase transparency in the insurers financial statements of life, non-life and reinsurance. The insurers providing long-term contracts will be most affected.
The new standard will require the insurers to provide a balance sheet valuation of their insurance liabilities that combines a measurement of the expected probability weighted future cash flows based on updated assumptions, with the recognition of profit over the period that services are provided, under the contract.
EY Sri Lanka Partner and Assurance Leader Manil Jayesinghe said, The new model requires the insurance contract liabilities to be reported on the balance sheet using the current assumptions at each reporting date. This is a profound change in terms of the current accounting requirements. The profit and loss account, however, will reflect the results from the provision of insurance services in the reporting period.
Hence, the model combines a current balance sheet measurement with reporting an entitys performance in profit or loss over time. The new model is likely to have a significant impact on profit and total equity for some insurance companies and groups. The changes to the key performance indicators are likely and there could be an increase in volatility in the reported equity and earnings compared to todays accounting models.

IFRS 17 in a nutshell
*The IFRS 17 model combines a current balance sheet measurement of insurance contract liabilities with the recognition of profit over the period that services are provided.
*Certain changes in the estimates of future cash flows and the risk adjustment are also recognised over the period that services are provided.
*Entities will have an option to present the effect of changes in discount rates either in profit and loss or in OCI.
*The standard includes specific guidance on measurement and presentation for insurance contracts with participation features.
*IFRS 17 will become effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2021; early application is permitted.
The effective date of January 1, 2021 for this standard will provide entities with an implementation period of around three and a half years. Whilst this implementation period is relatively long, the complexity of IFRS 17 is such that companies cannot afford to wait and will need to start preparing for implementation now.
As a starting point, insurance companies will need to separate components such as, embedded derivatives, if they meet certain specified criteria, distinct investment components and distinct performance obligations to provide non-insurance goods and services through an insurance contract, said EY Partner Financial Accounting Advisory Services Hiranthi Fonseka.
With the issue of IFRS 17, the insurance industry will have a commonly agreed foundation for accounting and reporting of revenues, profits and liability positions for insurance contracts. It is much more than a complex accounting change. This standard triggers fundamental changes in the way in which insurance companies will generate and report their financials, both internally and externally.
It also requires a new dimension of data granularity, to be accommodated by already stretched IT infrastructures that legacy applications used by most insurers will struggle to deliver. Last but not least, it introduces a new language for measuring and reporting financial performance that all stakeholders need to get used to, from the preparers and the investors, to the auditors and regulators.

AIA rolls out Pension Month
	

Have you thought about your retirement Or has planning for it seemed so complicated and overwhelming that you put it aside for later If so, then you are not alone. Most people find planning for retirement an expensive task with tons of paperwork, laborious medical testing and general stress. It is therefore often postponed or at times disregarded all together.
But the fact remains that retirement is imminent and so is inflation. If we dont plan now, we wont be able to afford to continue the lifestyle we are used to after retirement. Needless to say, the earlier you start planning, the more time you have to build your fund. The key is to start saving early and save regularly  even if it is small sums of money.
That is why AIA has developed a brand-new pension plan that allows you to do just that  introducing AIA Easy Pensions, an affordable, uncomplicated and comprehensive way to save for your retirement. For this retirement savings plan, you dont have the hassle of filling pages of complicated paper-work or taking time consuming medical tests. With minimum premiums starting as low as Rs.2,100  it is not only easy to process but also easy on the wallet.
You can now get an AIA Easy Pensions in three simple steps that are as easy as tak, tik, tuk: Tak  select how much you wish to save for retirement (four savings and protection packages to choose from). Tik  select how long you wish to pay for (select how long you wish to commit to paying your premiums). Tuk  decide if you want a lump sum or a monthly pension (you can collect your pension fund as a lump sum or as an increasing monthly pension for a period of 10 to 30 years).
Whats more AIA Easy Pensions comes with more features that not only get you retirement ready but offer protection along the way; a loyalty bonus on the 10th year to boost your retirement nest egg, life insurance to ensure the family is provided for in case you die, an increased accident cover if death is not due to natural causes and the flexibility of withdrawing funds in the event of an emergency.
AIAs Easy Pensions campaign, which was launched on October 8, to coincide with the National Pensioners Day, also coincides with the AIA Pension Month. Now in its third consecutive year, the AIA Pension Month is rolled out in October, with a concentrated effort to create more awareness about the need to start planning for retirement. During this time, AIAs nationwide team of wealth planners will put all their energy into guiding Sri Lankans to a more secure and ideal retirement.

## Title: Embracing digital payments can save global cities US $ 470bn annually
## Section: Financial News

Embracing digital payments can save global cities US $ 470bn annually
	
Visa, the global leader in digital payments technology, recently announced an independent study conducted by Roubini Thought Lab and commissioned by Visa, examining the economic impact of increasing the use of digital payments in major cities around the world, including Colombo could help the city realize, US $ 200 million annual net benefits.
The study estimates that relying more on electronic payments, such as cards and mobile payments, could yield a net benefit of up to US $ 470 billion per year across the 100 cities studied, roughly the equivalent to three percent of the average GDP for these cities.
For instance: Colombo, with a population of 694,000 and GDP of US $ 6.5 billion, could gain US $ 200million annual net benefits. Estimated catalytic impacts for the city over the next 15 years include 20.4 basis point increase in GDP growth rate and 2.1 percent increase in employment.
Cashless Cities: Realizing the Benefits of Digital Payments, is a unique study that quantifies the potential net benefits experienced by cities which move to an achievable level of cashlessnessdefined as the entire population of a city moving to digital payment usage equal to the top 10 percent of users in that city today. The study does not look at eliminating cash. Rather, it seeks to quantify the potential benefits and costs of significantly increasing the use of digital payments.
By reducing reliance on cash, the study estimates the immediate and long-term benefits for three main groupsconsumers, businesses and governments. According to the study, these benefits could add up to combined direct net benefits of approximately US $ 470 billion across the 100 cities that were analyzed.
Consumers across the 100 cities could achieve nearly US $ 28 billion per year in estimated direct net benefits. This impact would be derived from factors including up to 3.2 billion hours in time savings conducting banking, retail and transit transactions, in addition to a reduction in cash-related crime.
Businesses across the 100 cities could achieve more than US $ 312 billion per year in estimated direct benefits. This impact would be derived from factors including up to 3.1 billion hours in time savings processing incoming and outgoing payments and increased sales revenues stemming from extended online and in-store customer bases. The study also found that accepting cash and cheques costs businesses 7.1 cents of every dollar received compared to five cents of every dollar collected from digital sources.
Governments across the 100 cities could achieve nearly US $ 130 billion per year in estimated direct benefits. This impact would be derived from factors including increased tax revenues, increased economic growth, cost savings from administrative efficiencies and lower criminal justice costs due to reduced cash-related crime.
Visa India and South Asia Group Country Manager T.R. Ramachandran said, Cities are the new engines of economic growth. To unlock their true economic potential, and become globally competitive, cities must embrace digital payments. This global study shows how becoming more cashless delivers real benefits to governments, businesses and consumers, stimulating long-term economic growth. Colombo could achieve, on average, US$200million in annual net benefits, roughly the equivalent to three percent of the citys average GDP.
As cities increase use of digital payments, the positive impacts can extend beyond financial benefits to consumers, businesses, and government. The shift to digital payments also may have a catalytic effect on the citys overall economic performance, including GDP, employment, wage, and productivity growth.
Roubini Thought Lab Head Lou Celi said, The use of digital technologies, from smart phones and wearables to artificial intelligence and driverless cars, is rapidly transforming how city dwellers shop, travel, and live. Without a firm foundation in electronic payments, cities will not be able to fully capture their digital future, according to our analysis.
Cashless Cities: Realizing the Benefits of Digital Payments offers 61 recommendations for policymakers to help their cities become more efficient through greater adoption of digital payments. Recommendations include undertaking financial literacy programmes to help move the unbanked into the banking system, implementing incentives to stimulate innovation focused on scaling new payment technologies, implementing secure open-loop payment systems across all transportation networks and more.

## Title: Ishan Bahar pays tribute to a golden age in pop

Ishan Bahar pays tribute to a golden age in pop
	
Ishan Bahar with singer son Ricardo and grand daughter Shyanne

Ishan Bahar, a musical legend whose name is indelibly associated with that compellingly musical 60s-70s band known as the Jetliners (Its latest incarnation is said to be still around), has compiled two valuable reference works titled A Heritage of Song in two parts. 
For those with fading memories, or born too late to have any memories at all of that mesmeric era of Sri Lankas Western Pop, these two books (Subtitled The Musical Journeys of Musicians With Sri Lankan Roots) will offer loads of nostalgia and insights. 
They would too, surely elicit gasps of: Hey, I didnt know there were so many singers, bands and musicians in this country!
Listed in both books are an incredible 330 show biz personalities, men and women, dating from the 1950s to the first decade of the new millennium. Part I is elegantly black and white while Part II carries both b & w and colour images (the latter will be launched in Melbourne, Australia, later this month).
While some of these names would be familiar  Noeline Honter, Raj Seneviratne, Mignone Fernando, Desmond de Silva, Nimal Jayamanne, Alston Koch, Yolande Bavan, Maxi Rosairo, Sohan Pieris, Corinne Almeida, Eranga and Priyanga, Priyanthi and Raja Jalaldeen, Harold Seneviratne and Debbie Arnolda  many others live in retirement or semi-retirement now, and the present generation would know little or nothing about them but for these two books. This isnt an all inclusive list. Ishan Bahar spent years contacting former friends, and colleagues, many of whom now live in Australia and elsewhere. Some never replied, or even declined to send information about themselves. Happily, though, most were eager to cooperate, sending him mini biographies and photographs. 
The result is an invaluable reference work with a dazzling photo gallery which brings to life vividly a superlative era in our pop music and show business.
Ishan Bahar played a key role in this dazzle as frontman for the Jetliners, one of the top 60-70s bands, along with Mignone Fernando (Nee Ratnam), so much so that Ishan and Mignone with the Jetliners became a synonym for first class pop entertainment. 
But these two books by this singer-turned archivist have guaranteed a permanent place in our musical history for hundreds of other artistes and bands which would have otherwise been condemned to oblivion.

"His mother, called Mahat, was a singer, too. Ishans cousin Naval Lieutenant Shanthi Bahar was the first naval casualty of the civil war when he was killed by a grenade thrown by a female LTTE cadre."
Much of this music was concentrated in Colombo and its suburbs. Colombo was then a sleepy port city with a population of less than half a million where only major junctions hosted traffic lights and traffic jams were a novelty. Other cities such as Kandy hosted these musicians in much smaller numbers. 
How did so many musicians find work There was a cultural dynamism about Colombo  music, films, plays, poetry readings and much else  that belied the relatively small numbers. These singers and bands were in demand at the night clubs, hotel ballrooms, weddings, parties, socials, annual get togethers and Christmas/New Year dances. Singers such as Mignone and Dalrene were pop divas. 
Sometimes, tickets had to be booked in advance at venues where the top bands played, and fans lined up to get their autographs.
They catered mainly to English-speaking fans, not all of them necessarily elite though the night club crowd, as opposed to todays, came exclusively from the high and glamorous segment of Colombo society. Some of these singers and bands were featured in Sinhala movies (Delovak Athara, Adare Hithenawa Dekkama, Satha Panaha, Surayangeth Suraya etc.) but they were not household names in the world of Sinhala pop music. 
There was little crossover between the two. 

"While some of these names would be familiar  Noeline Honter, Raj Seneviratne, Mignone Fernando, Desmond de Silva, Nimal Jayamanne, Alston Koch, Yolande Bavan, Maxi Rosairo, Sohan Pieris, Corinne Almeida, Eranga and Priyanga, Priyanthi and Raja Jalaldeen, Harold Seneviratne and Debbie Arnolda  many others live in retirement or semi-retirement now, and the present generation would know little or nothing about them but for these two books."
The venues had names like the Coconut Grove at Galle Face Hotel, featuring the Jetliners along with other top performers), the Blue Leopard, Mascarilla ( again at Galle Face Hotel), the Silver Fawn, Orchid Room, the Copacabana, Club 388, Fountain Caf, Ceylinco ballroom, Little Hut and the Kandy Lake Club. The night club culture was very different then from what it is now, and these musicians were an elite catering to an elite who enjoyed good music in a sophisticated, cosmopolitan world where racial barriers hardly mattered, and music was primarily a pleasing aesthetic experience, where individual sonic definition of each instrument mattered more than a compression of deafening electronics.
Ishan Bahar doesnt come from a family of professional musicians. But his maternal grandfather, a jailor, was a left-handed violinist. His paternal grandfather was given the title of gate mudaliyar by British Governor Sir Edward Barnes. His father, an English teacher at Zahira College, Colombo, started the countrys first indoor cricket school and captained the Malay cricket team for 27 years. In addition, he was good at tennis and played the piano. The youngest brother, B.J.H. Bahar, was an army major and could sing like Bing Crosby.
His mother, called Mahat, was a singer, too. Ishans cousin Naval Lieutenant Shanthi Bahar was the first naval casualty of the civil war when he was killed by a grenade thrown by a female LTTE cadre. 
His elder brother as well as both sisters are singers and they have sung together as a family. His son Ricardo Bahar is a professional singer. Shane and Mario, his other sons, engage in other professions, but singing runs in this family. Ishans wife Dawn too, is a singer, and so is grandson Mathias Ishan Mario, aged two, whose picture is on the cover of book twoof the series. 

"Ishan Bahar has really paid a tribute to his fellow musicians by putting together these books. It is a nostalgic musical journey taking us back to the most exciting era of our Western pop music that we are ever likely to see"
Like many of his contemporaries, Ishan Bahar has not really retired. He runs his own advertising agency now and performs whenever possible. Putting together these two books is a major achievement, as they offer a vivid picture of Colombos Western pop milieu at its most eclectic, ethnically diverse and brightest, when local pop stars not only ruled the musical roost but turned music into an export item. Performing all over the world, they earned valuable foreign exchange for a cash-strapped country (plus supporting a Sri Lankan recording industry).
Much has happened since Tony Fernando, the Jetliners manager, heard Ishan perform at the Fountain Caf with Geoff Labrooy in 1961. That music continues to be replayed, but the spirit and even the sounds are different.
That was a time when radio played a big part in the making of musicians, the Sinhala service with its auditioning and the English service with programmes like Breakfast with Nestles.
The bands themselves had bold, inspired, exotic and sometimes silly names  Claude Selvaratnam and the Esquire Set, the Rhythm Dukes under Rex de Silva, the Fireflies, Ceylon Gems, Soundwaves, The Dizzy Dez Combo, Nitebirds, Helen Menezes Combo, Cass Ziard Quintet, the Spitfires, Amazing Grace, Saybahn & The Tempo, Claude and the Sensations, Cardinals Outburst, the all Sindhi band called Dynamites, Ayesha and the Dream Team, Tyronne Pieris and the Cosmic Rays, Shorty and the Tall Boys, The Melody Troubadours, The Red Dragons, Thunderbirds, Banknotes, Speed Jets, Roger & the Webs, The Buggs, Five Sharps and Christine and the Set Up. Many of these bands toured the world, playing at venues ranging from Kabul, Afghanistan, to Pashawar, Pakistan, and Mumbai, India, the Middle East, Hong Kong, Singapore, Papua New Guinea, Western Europe, Australia and even the U.S. The musicians were as diverse. Anton Gunatilleke made his own guitars at age 13  an acoustic instrument with a biscuit tin, discarded timber and strings from tennis and badminton strings, and an electric guitar using bicycle parts. Trumpeter Eden Pompeus jammed with a trio of Duke Ellingtons sidemen when the Duke and his orchestra visited Sri Lanka. Cliff Foenander played with a Hong Kong band and made records under the Liberty label there, including a bestselling version of Sukiyaki, before going to play in the US. Whenever one hears the version by Kyu Sakamoto on one of our nostalgic FM channels, I wonder what happened to Cliff Foenanders version. 
Speed Jets, the countrys first all-girl beat group consisting of Sudharsha, Dharshani ad Manique, achieved great popularity but disbanded at age 18 in 1972 due to parental pressure. The Kandyan-born singing couple Christine and Victor were as well known as Eranga and Priyanga in their heyday. Conrad de Silva of the Spitfires and the Jetliners played a part in the song Dreamworld composed by Des Kelly and recorded with the Semitones. It became one of the first Sri Lankan songs to be recorded by the Philips international label (the number of EPs and LPs, as well as cassette tapes of local talent produced in Sri Lanka during this epoch would be another fascinating area of research. 
Noeline Honters City of Colombo is one such song which seems to have disappeared).
Then there is Nihara Loos, daughter of jazz guitarist Ghazali Amit, and younger artistes such as singer Mariezelle Gunathilake, jazz musician Shobi Perera, and singer and saxophonist Dr. Gananath Dasanayake. 
Ishan Bahar has really paid a tribute to his fellow musicians by putting together these books. It is a nostalgic musical journey taking us back to the most exciting era of our Western pop music that we are ever likely to see (This article is open to comments at ga3004@gmail.com.

MR urges Govt. to abandon 'destructive proposal'
	
Former president Mahinda Rajapaksa in a statement today, urged the government to abandon what he described as the destructive proposal for a new constitution.
He said the vast majority of Tamil and Muslim people lived outside the Northern and Eastern Provinces and therefore the carving out of federal units based on ethnicity or religion and the conferring of sweeping powers on such units should never take place in this country.
The government has tabled in Parliament, proposals for a new constitution. The constitutional reform pledges made by the yahapalana coalition at the last presidential election was restricted to changing the system of elections and abolishing the executive presidential system. This government never received a mandate to repeal and replace the existing constitution. We are completely opposed to the following proposals made in the interim report of the Steering Committee of the Constitutional Assembly.
It has been proposed that the Sinhala word ekeeya be retained in the Sinhala version of the proposed new constitution, while the English word unitary will be dropped from the English version together with the conceptual framework it denotes. Thus the local population will be under the impression that Sri Lanka still remains a unitary state, but in the eyes of the international community, we will be considered a country that has relinquished unitary status. That such chicanery can even be contemplated is indicative of the mentality of the people driving this constitutional reform process.
The intent behind these reforms is made clear by the proposal in page four that the northern and eastern provinces be considered one province. Furthermore it has been proposed that the territory of Sri Lanka which is described in Article 5 of the present Constitution as consisting of the 25 administrative districts named in the relevant Schedule, be instead described in terms of an unspecified number of provinces named in a Schedule rather than the specific number of districts  which gives an indication of the intent behind these proposals," Mr. Rajapaksa said.

Political prisoners claim shows TNAs duplicity: PHU
	
The Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) said today the Tamil National Alliances (TNA)s efforts and backing to get those who were arrested under terrorist charges released, showed their duplicity.
Addressing a news briefing, PHU Leader MP Udaya Gammanpila said the TNA wants action against soldiers for war crimes which they didnt commit, but at the same time wants to get terrorists released.
There is no other group in the world which is more duplicitous than the TNA. It is with great responsibility we say that there are no political prisoners in the country as claimed by them, he said.
The MP said these detainees had not been imprisoned for being members of a terrorist organisation but because there are terrorist and murder charges against them.
About 12,000 LTTE members who surrendered with weapons to the state were rehabilitated and repatriated. The rest of the LTTE members were imprisoned because there are terrorist charges against them, he said.
He said those who had committed charges had today become political prisoners to M. K. Shivajilingam and C. V. Vigneswaran. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

The President and Prime Minister should immediately respond to the Mahanayake Theras request of resolving the SAITM issue as soon as possible, the Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) said today.
Addressing a press briefing GMOA Spokesman Dr. Samantha Ananda warned that the issue could be further aggravated if the two first citizens of the country remained silent on the matter. 
He said that the Theras made the statement considering the inconvenience to the public because of the issue.
Both the President and the Premier cannot just disregard the Theras statement as they are respected by the whole nation. As a country with traditional and religious values, the government should respect the Mahanayake Theras word without looking at the matter with hatred.

Sad to see long-serving SLFP organizers removed-John
	
Labour and Trade Union Relations Minister John Seneviratne, who is a senior member of Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP), said yesterday that it was sad that some party organizers who had served the party for a long time had been expelled even without giving them reasons for their dismissal.
Minister Seneviratne told Daily Mirror that he hoped President Maithripala Sirisena would reconsider his decision.
The minister said these organizers had allegedly been removed because they had neglected their work for the party in their areas. However, he said the party men were overwhelmingly against the current state of affairs, and therefore the organizers had no way of working in the interests of the party.
If they have been dismissed because they did not work in their electorates then they should be given the chance to explain their stance, he said.(Kelum Bandara)

TRIBUTE: Celebrating silver jubilee of worlds noblest service
	
St. Sebastians College, Moratuwa

As great Indian philosopher Chanakya stated, a teacher is a person who can produce construction and destruction in his lap. The quotation indicates the power of teaching; one of the oldest and noblest services in the world. Ms. Roshani Fernando, Ms. Berny Perera and Mr. Lakmal Fernando are also such great personalities who moulded the minds of students, dedicating 25 years of their lives for teaching. 
The trio enlightened thousands of students at St. Sebastians College, Moratuwa. They shared their experience of last 25 years with the Daily Mirror and responded individually to a common question regarding their opinion on the creativity of children nowadays. They were of the view that lack of artistic programmes in school curriculum, less time for children to engage in different activities and mounting pressure on children has caused the loss of creativity in the young generation. They stated that teachers should create more space to allow children to think freely and to express themselves in unique manners.

I consider myself privileged to study as a pupil and work as a teacher in thesame school
- Lakmal Fernando
I started my education from grade 1 way back in 1977 at St. Sebastians College, Moratuwa and have grown personally and professionally along with this institution. I consider myself privileged to study as a pupil and work as a teacher in the same school. I assumed duties as a teacher in October, 1992. Having been worked as the Head of Grade eight section for 10 years, currently I am specializing Commerce and Business Studies for Ordinary Level students. Teaching has always been my passion and this noble profession has given me an opportunity to give direction to my students.
Parents focus only to get their students passed from all the examinations; ultimately the children fail to pass the greatest and most important examination called life. They lack social knowledge. Consequently, the young generations easily become victims of various anti-social things. We should create more space for them to spend more time with the nature. Education should not be confined into a classroom. At one point, parents should be held responsible because they are the ones who are pushing the children towards the competition. It is rare to find teenagers who read books and listen to good music. I try to plant this idea in my students minds. 

As a teacher, I have learned the lessons of life from the innocent students also
- Berny Perera

I stepped into this school on July 13, 1992. The subject I am teaching is Sinhala for grade 7 and 8 students. I am also the Sinhala Subject Head of secondary section of the school. Frankly, during the first few years,
I was a typical teacher. By the
time, I realized that there was much more
I could do for the society as a teacher. Then, I started moulding the minds of students how to be sensitive human beings who have empathy and ability to see the life in a different way. As a teacher, I have learned the lessons of life from the innocent students also. It is another important thing about the profession of teaching as it enlightens both sides of the teacher as well as the student.
I think the number of subjects should be reduced and only most important subjects should remain. Educational changes should be made to take the students out of the classroom and keep them engaged in different activities that foster their creativity. Current situation poses a huge threat to the thinking ability of the future generation. As an Arts teacher, I believe there should be more lessons related to entertainment and Arts. Regularly, we hear news about teenagers who committed suicide. It is evident that the education system has failed to address the minds of the young generation and has created a generation who are not able to face problems in their lives.

Twenty five years of memorable service was possible only because of caring, human attitude of everyone associated here
- Roshani Fernando

I have been associated with this prestigious institution since January 22, 1992. St. Sebastians College, Moratuwa is my second home. Currently, I am teaching Mathematics for Grade seven and eight students.
When I joined the school, Rev. Bro. Granvil Perera was the principal. When looking at the past, I see our school has gradually developed thanks to many reverends especially Rev. Fr. Bonnie Fernandopulle. However, it is hard to express the satisfaction I have had being a teacher. Twenty five years of memorable service was possible only because of caring, human attitude of everyone associated here.
In our school days, there was no pressure on us. By the time, syllabuses became much bigger, leveling pressure on students and reducing leisure for them to engage in extra-curricular activities. It goes without saying that the competition is uncontrollably high nowadays. Innocent children are struggling with time to cover everything. As a result of this unhealthy trend, students who are produced to the society lack empathy, patience and ability to face unexpected challenges in their lives.
