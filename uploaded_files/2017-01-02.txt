2017 a year of Transition from Globalization  to Economic Nationalism
	
Years come and go and likewise time passes through our civilizations adding things to history. The New Year which arrived on January 1, 2017 will not be an ordinary year for mankind in many aspects.?
This is a year of transition and ideological conflict because of Globalization Vs Nationalism, International conventions Vs interest of Nation State, Free trade Vs Protectionism, Secularism Vs Religious fundamentalism, Universal values Vs National values. This will create a new era of economic nationalism, and not merely a beginning of another year. It will be an opening of a new era of nationalism in place of globalization. There will be many conflicts of ideas and actions by different States. ?
This is going to be a new era which will change the entire geo-political structure of the world. Many scholars may give different names and interpretations to this era such as new nationalism, protectionism or economic nationalism. With the growing religious ideologies some academics might argue that this will be a religious (Christian) nationalism. Whatever the interpretation this will definitely be the beginning of an era of many ideological differences among nations based on the religious and racial identities leading to ultra-nationalism among nations. ?
It is interesting to define the concept of nationalism. Different scholars have given different definitions and explanations in regard to nationalism. In its basic form nationalism is a collective social thought. It demands the freedom from universal global nationalism. This concept contemplates that the foundation of the human society is the nation State. This comprises a collective language, economics, and socio cultural entity, which will be given by a state mechanism and is called the concept of Nation as a result of these conceptualizations. ??
Thereafter the supremacy of the human race was established and it was unquestionable that humans can suppress all other living beings including animals, flora and fauna on the planet. ?
When nationalism surfaced in those countries, individual nations began to think each one of them was superior to other nations. As an example, manifestation of State ideology, development of Aryanism as a racial dogma in Germany, growth of Anglo-Saxon ideology and Nazi and occupations based on the religious ideological concepts acted on the belief that there was a targeted select group of people to spread their religious beliefs by force or any other means. ?
Via religious fundamentalism, countries such as Israel, Iran and Saudi Arabia are predominantly fuelling this ideology to name a few. In contrast to this religion fundamentalism a class concept based on the productivity process has come into focus which is on the premise that it is the division of labour which drives society and its civilization progressively. ?
It is thought-provoking to study the recent history related to the concept of nationalism. A significant phenomenon occurred after the Second World War in the western world through the Bretton Woods Conference which created a global system of monetary management. This was established to cater for the rules for commercial and financial relations mostly among the western nations. As this system of economic activities around the world was developed, subsequently a general orientation towards a strong market based approach which we called market fundamentalism or neo-liberalism through the Washington Consensus was created especially after 1990. This economic globalization was primarily aimed at opening markets of developing countries to the global market. This is mainly to control and direct the world economy through the instrument of free trade. ?
To strengthen and establish the economic and social globalization more and more market-based mechanisms were to be established in the world. This was amply supported by the World Bank, IMF,WTO and also to a certain extent some UN mechanisms through many multilateral agreements and covenants. ?
?
"To strengthen and establish the economic and social globalization more and more market-based mechanisms were to be established in the world"
On the other hand, the Soviet Economic System was the direct challenge to this market-based economic system which was successfully defeated through military invasions, military coups, and economic sanctions and many more clandestine socio economic strategies used by the capitalistic forces. In doing so the western political leadership was on the premise that there was one solitary universal value system for the entire world irrespective of geographical, racial, ideological, religious and cultural differences among different nations and ethnic groups. ??
After the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1990, Francis Fukuyama in his famous book ?The End of History and the Last Man (1992)? argued that the liberal democracies and free market capitalism of the west and its life style signalled the end point of humanity?s sociocultural evolution without any confrontation. He predicted that this as the Universal Value System acceptable to all and there would not be any further evolution in the global socio economic evolution. ?
On the other hand an entire opposite hypothesis is developed by Samuel Huntington who defines, that the conflict between the socialism, communism and the market based capitalism conflict is now over and there will be a new clash among civilizations. Accordingly, he predicted that religious fundamentalism would grow among and within that nation States especially there would be clashes among Christianity and Islamic fundamentalism beyond nation States. ?
With recent happenings in the global geopolitical scenario, most of the old concepts have been rejected resulting in an entire new paradigm shift towards individual nations States. The oil crisis occurred in 2008 and the world financial crisis that has occurred during the same period and the Islamic terrorist attacks targeting the western world are not isolated incidents but connected to each other in many ways. This was fuelled by the prediction of the Islamic population exceeding the Christian population and China expecting to be the world?s economic super power by 2020. ?
Parallel to these drastic changes in the global economic context, China becoming the military super power of the world will be unstoppable and unavoidable. Corresponding to this phenomena there would be many more retrenchments and lost opportunities for the workforce and the business community in the developed world as a result of low cost and inexpensive Chinese products. ?
The loss of opportunities and worsening of financial stability in the western world has created the ideal breeding ground to surface the contemporary nationalistic phenomena in their countries. Therefore, once again based on the foundation of nationalism or national States a socio economic action is in need for political enterprises. As a result we can see the surfacing of politicians like Nigel Farage in Britain, Mori Lupe in France, Marcus Pretzell in Germany, Trump Phenomena in US, Pauline Hanson in Australia to name a few. In the US it is noteworthy to observe that a powerful section of the Republican Party that believes in this fundamentalist ideology has surfaced predominantly giving dangerous signals to the entire world. All these people and movements were called Alt-right nationalists with far right ideologies based on white supremacist and nationalism. They believe that their white identity is under attack by various multicultural forces and different identities. ?
As a result a new nationalism is immensely developing among the western nations. Once again national identity, national economy, protective market polices, and social values based on one?s national identity are resurrecting their importance especially among the predominantly white nations. Originally as small groups but now with the spread of their ideology in a significant way slowly but steadily these movements are clutching the key political parties in their own countries. The emergence of Trump phenomena is not an isolated incident but as a result of these changes in the global social equilibrium. ??
?
"With recent happenings in the global geopolitical scenario, most of the old concepts have been rejected resulting in an entire new paradigm shift towards individual nations States"
During the year 2016, a decisive political phenomenon occurred in the West. Most people identified this as a far right wing movement. However, when we look at this socio political phenomena it was obvious that the real background to this phenomena consists of labourers and the working class in those countries who were frustrated for many years. Therefore, these phenomena occurred not just only for one reason but as a result of many complex multidimensional reasons. This phenomenon will progress further in the year 2017 and may be in a more proactive way. ?
We, as a country, should look at the options left for our country to progress through this uncertain period. In the Sri Lankan context, Sri Lanka?s current strategy is to sustain and enhance further our products and services to the western markets and to attract more foreign direct investment especially from the western world and China. ?
However, due to the neo-nationalism and protectionism now surfacing in their own countries, at the end of the day the developed world will tend to produce their own products and services within their countries. This will create additional restrictions on our export products. ?
It is prudent and necessary for us to find new markets and opportunities for our products and services. To aggravate this situation further western nations will tend to invest within their own countries to protect their job opportunities and markets. It is evident that Trump will aim to promote coal power generation resulting in drastic global environmental consequences. Learning from this western world will tend to disregard the international conventions for climate change especially the Paris Agreement. They will also violate more openly the human rights, disregard defence treaties such as NATO, economic partnerships and the ?Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP), Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) etc. ?
In view of this we need to find new strategies for novel markets and opportunities especially among the Asian nations. This may be through bilateral agreements and regional groupings for new export markets. Another area which needs our attention would be the import substitution strategy to protect and develop domestic production. ?
The ever escalating trade war between US and China will make huge changes in the global market scenario pivoting the power equation towards China. Therefore, we need to focus and adjust our economic strategies to face this global changes and challenges. ?
We cannot wait any longer for traditional way of attracting Foreign Direct Investment and opening of foreign markets for our products. We need to enter into a new set of economic strategies and activities. ?

Amana Bank in talks with foreign parties to raise minimum core capital
	
Amana Bank PLC, Sri Lanka?s first non-interest model Islamic bank, is in talks with prospective foreign parties to infuse equity capital to meet the regulatory minimum capital requirements, the bank said in a stock exchange filing.?
Such a deal could see the bank divesting a stake to a foreign party as the bank is negotiating to bring in equity. The bank however said such capital raising is subject to the necessary regulatory approvals.?
?Such raising of funds, by way of equity, would be subject to the approvals of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka, Department of Exchange Control, Securities and Exchange Commission of Sri Lanka, Colombo Stock Exchange (as applicable) and shareholders,? Amana Bank said in its filing.
According to the minimum capital enhancement plan of the Central Bank, Amana Bank was required to raise its minimum core capital to Rs.10 billion by January 1, 2016. But the Central Bank, in 2015, granted the bank time till January 1, 2018 to meet the requirement with interim targets.?
According to the capital augmentation plan agreed with the regulator, the bank was required to raise its minimum core capital to Rs.7.5 billion by January 1, 2017 and further up to Rs.10.0 billion by January 1, 2018.?
As of September 30, 2016, however, the bank was failing short of meeting this interim target as its core capital stood at Rs.5.2 billion.?
Meanwhile, the budget 2017 proposed to double the banking sector minimum core capital level to Rs.20.0 billion, though no timeline was given. But it is expected the new capital levels would come into effect from January 1, 2018 onwards?an year from now.?
However, the Central Bank has to issue a clear direction to the banks because the Finance Ministry cannot specify minimum capital levels to commercial banks.?
The budget proposal to double the minimum capital levels of banks is said to be an arbitrary decision by the country?s belligerent finance minister though the Central Bank was consulted later on the matter.
However, the new Basel III rules demand higher capital adequacy levels in comparison to the risk-weighted assets to ensure banks operate with higher capital buffers to withstand shocks in times of stress, similar to the times of global financial crisis in 2008/9.?
While some of the liquidity and interim capital adequacy levels are already monitored by the regulator at present, the Central Bank is most likely to issue directives on Basel III early this year, which will come into full force from 2019 onwards.?
According to sources, Amana Bank has already lined up up to Rs.10.0 billion in equity capital and the current talks are for the balance requirement to meet the Rs.20.0 billion capital base.?
?The bank would make further announcements to the market on the progress of such discussions, upon receiving firm commitments,? Amana Bank said in its filing.?
Bank Islam Malaysia Berhad, AB Bank in Bangladesh and Islamic Development Bank based in Saudi Arabia cumulatively account for a 38.5 percent stake in the bank.?
For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, Amana Bank surpassed its Rs.100 million profit mark and posted a net profit of Rs.101.5 million or eight cents a share, which is 16.3 percent less than an year ago.?

Being a Perera: What?s in a Name
	
A reader and a well-known Buddhist scholar mailed a comment in response to my article on Vap full moon day [15/10] entitled, ?Futility of Abhi-dhamma in the Path of Emancipation? with a harsh personal attack saying , ?You are a skeptic heathenist with a Portuguese name who is trying to ?? ?[sorry, the rest is unprintable, but I referred the dictionary and made a short reply thanking him for upgrading my poor vocabulary]; ?he, however, coaxed me to reminisce down memory lane to mid 1950s, when our teacher, Mrs ? Perera was taking a class on Ceylon history at lower school, St John?s College, Panadura. [I wrote part of this true ?anecdote? five years ago in another paper. Let me share it with your readers as well]
She wanted all Pereras to raise their hands. ?Five of us responded to a rather friendly appeal than a command made to 25 to 30 boys and girls in the class. Among them was Sumana, the only female in the clan of Pereras, who was a distant cousin of mine. It was customary for the class teacher to nominate a girl and a boy to share a common desk and bench. I shared the front row centre desk with Sumana. She was extremely good in her work and occupied the first two places in the merit list, though only one year my senior? Sumana always ?helped? me in answering at term tests! It was sixty years ago and being 12 year-olds, we were good friends, classmates, connected and neighbours too.
The teacher continued, ?They say, if someone kicks a bush a couple of Pereras will toss-away, how many of you would agree?? making the entire class roar with laughter. While we the Perera boys were somewhat bemused, agreed with the saying discomforting the teacher herself, but Sumana, the obstinate girl she was, indifferent to the loud guffaw, answered in the negative. She stunned the class, when she rejoined,
??Teacher, we Pereras would never crawl inside a bush.??
The pin drop silence embarrassed all other non-Pereras and Pereras, including the writer.
?I am delighted that there was one good answer from a Perera,? replied the elated teacher.
It was when she began her history lesson a few minutes later that we realized she was preparing to talk on the role of Miguel Pereira, the Portuguese administrator in the 16th century?s Lisbon rule over Ceylon?s coastal belt, which prompted her to gossip about ?Pereras? in the middle of her history lesson. I doubt if they were trained in student psychology or teaching skills six decades ago at teacher training schools; yet we had exceptional teachers then. ?The name Perera was launched here by the Portuguese along with hosts of other Portuguese names like Silva, Fonseka, Rodrigo, and Fernando, to mention a few.?
?
?What?s in a name? that which we call a rose
By any other name would smell as sweet.??
-William Shakespeare,?
[Romeo and Juliet]?
?Perera or Pereira? is a common name even today in Spain, Portugal, ?Brazil and even in Goa, the overseas territory of ?Portuguese India? which existed for over four centuries until the early 1960s, when it was annexed by India. The name derives from ?Pereira? meaning Pear tree.?
During the evening of my corporate carrier, and in the last lap of working life 12 years ago, once I was assigned to go Katunayake to receive a CEO from one of our Indian principals who owned quite a few Pharmaceutical manufacturing operations in many parts of the world (he was crowned the richest in India in 2014). ?Their country manager in Sri Lanka introduced me to him mentioning my name with emphasis on ?Perera?, in addition to other ?decorations?. I had a brief chat with him at the lounge before travelling to Colombo separately. ?The next morning at a meeting with our Chairman CEO, he had mentioned,?
??That Indian director, who is working for you, a Perera from Goa??
So, much so for school and working life blemishes: In retirement, venturing into the interesting but somewhat ?hazardous? endeavour of writing to newspapers; a few years ago I made a suggestion in the-S/Times, asking ?why not introduce a few Tamil verses and sing the National Anthem in both languages??, to receive some harsh responses from readers, once again a few of them targeting the name Perera. Responses to recent article, ??Why Buddhism?, we are a secular State; Give Foremost place to Dhamma only,? attracted the attention of a few ?Buddhists?, one of them said, ??Pereras were the people who vandalized temples in the 16th century.?
?
"?Perera or Pereira? is a common name even today in Spain, Portugal, ?Brazil and even in Goa, the overseas territory of ?Portuguese India? which existed for over four centuries until the early 1960s, when it was annexed by India. The name derives from ?Pereira? meaning Pear tree"
?
My generation?s readers would remember, how the now redundant ?Independent Newspapers group? in mid-1970s slander Trotskyite leader Dr N.M Perera, the Finance Minister, in Sirimavo Bandaranaike?s United Front Government by stressing in bold letters ?Pe-Ray -Raa? (meaning toddy is oozing), criticizing his proposal to allow owners of coconut trees to tap two trees for toddy without obtaining a valid licence. The global economic depression resulted in a sky-rocketing of food prices; the entire sugar quota was imported causing a severe load on nation?s coffers. While a significant section of the population was clamoring for food in the waste bins[remember the 70s?], the ?the never-say-die? factions of party loyalists [a fast disappearing idiotic clan from both camps] walked in procession shouting ?SEENI-NETHUVA-TE-BONAVA?, meaning, let?s have tea without sugar, an analogous to a slogan at today?s ?Diabetic-Day- Walk?. They say ?History repeats itself.?
?
?
"Dr. NM, the minister, who was coined ??N?o ?M?oney Perera, (Work of smart newspaper men) was forced to introduce the system as an inducement to make jaggery ?as a home industry and lessen the burden on the budget?s sugar component"
?
Dr. NM, the minister, who was coined ??N?o ?M?oney Perera, (Work of smart newspaper men) was forced to introduce the system as an inducement to make jaggery ?as a home industry and lessen the burden on the budget?s sugar component. May be he genuinely expected the house wives to use it for jaggery making; but, what did the husbands do is anybody?s guess!
However, Independent Newspapers, managed by The Gunasenas, continued their intense denigration not only on the Marxists, but the entire government using a few Sinhala and English journals like Sun, Dawasa and Sawasa, which compelled the UF government of 70-77 to end the drama by sealing their press at Hulftsdorp Hill.?
Private print media, in the absence of electronic were never free and fair then [are they now?]. Every government flexed its muscles to restrict them. That was the media freedom in the ?good old days?!
My father, who had qualms about continuing with the name, added another name before Perera to all male siblings, expecting us to drop the ?Perera? somewhere down the line. However, none of the six males was anxious. We all kept on adding dozens of Pereras down to second and third generations.?
Proud to be a Perera, kks-

Deutsche Bank agrees to US $ 7.2bn mortgage settlement with US
	
REUTERS: ?Deutsche Bank has agreed to a US $ 7.2 billion settlement with the US Department of Justice over its sale and pooling of toxic mortgage securities in the run-up to the 2008 financial crisis.
The agreement in principle, announced by Deutsche Bank?s Frankfurt headquarters early Friday morning, offers some relief to the German lender, whose stock was hit hard in September after it acknowledged the Justice Department had been seeking nearly twice as much.
It also highlights the Justice Department?s recent efforts to hold European banks accountable for shoddy securities that contributed to the US housing market collapse. The department sued Barclays PLC over similar claims, after having reached US $ 46 billion in settlements with US banks over the last three years.
Deutsche Bank does not plan a capital increase to cover the settlement, a person close to the bank said. The lender expects the agreement to be finalized in early 2017, before President-elect Donald Trump takes office, said the source, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
Deutsche does expect to record a pre-tax charge of about US $ 1.17 billion in its fourth quarter because of the civil monetary penalty, according to its press release.
As part of the agreement, Deutsche Bank would pay a civil monetary penalty of US $ 3.1 billion and provide US $ 4.1 billion in consumer relief, such as loan forgiveness. The bank cautioned that there is ?no assurance? the two sides will agree on the final documents.
A spokesman for the Justice Department declined to comment. Settling the mortgage-securities case would mean Deutsche Bank has shaken off one legal headache. Three major probes remain.
Deutsche faces investigations into the alleged manipulation of foreign exchange rates, suspicious equities trades in Russia, as well as alleged violations of US sanctions on Iran and other countries.
Since 2012, Deutsche Bank has already paid more than 12 billion euros for litigation, including a deal with US mortgage-finance giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
Deutsche Bank?s ?troubling practices? were widespread, including when trader Greg Lippmann told colleagues that many home loans the bank was packaging into securities were ?crap? and ?pigs?, according to a 2011 US Senate subcommittee report.
Lippmann has declined to comment on the report.
There has been fear among investors, companies and regulators that the penalties are too much for Deutsche Bank to withstand.

370 foreigners deported in 2016: India, China and Pakistan top the list
	
A total of 370 foreign nationals from more than 40 countries, who were living in Sri Lanka defying visa regulations had been deported by the Department of Immigration and Emigration during last year, Immigration officials said.
The department?s chief raiding body Monitoring, Intelligence, and Investigation Unit undertook over seven hundred cases involving 728 foreigners that had been living in the country for various reasons.
Amongst the arrested nationals from 45 countries since January 01 to December 31, the highest number of persons that had been removed was from India, which is at 154.
The authorities have also removed 51 Chinese nationals, 47 Pakistani nationals, 33 Nepalese and 25 Thai nationals top the list.
Rest of the foreigners were from Bangladesh, Uzbekistan, South Africa, Philippine, Saudi, Korea, Australia and the UK.
Controller General Immigration and Emigration Nihal Ranasinghe told the Daily Mirror that majority of these removed foreign nationals have violated their visa regulations and were overstaying in the country for numerous purposes.
Chief Immigration Officer Amith S Perera in charge of the Monitoring, Intelligence and Investigation Unit said that they will intensify the detections in the future to seize more foreigners that believed to be overstaying countrywide.(Kurulu Koojana Kariyakarawana)

Govt. finds it impossible to acquire 15,000 acres from H'tota at once for Chinese investment
	
The government has found it impossible to acquire 15,000 acres of land at once in Hambantota or in the adjoining Districts for Chinese investments, it is learnt.
Initially, the Government planned to acquire 9000 acres from the Hambantota District for the port ?integrated industrial zones, and another 6,000 acres from the Moneragala and other districts.
However, the government now found it practically difficult to acquire such a large extent of land for the projects, officials said.
Land survey work has also been stopped as a result.
The government initially planned to sign an agreement on January 7 with China Merchants Company to hand over an 80 percent stake of the Hambantota Port to it for development.
It reportedly hangs in the balance now due to differences of opinion among government leaders on the model for sharing equity between the Chinese company and the government.
The Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP), it is learnt, is opposed to hand over an 80 percent stake. It proposed a percentage less than that for sharing equity, sources said. (Kelum Bandara)

Govt. has planned to make 2017, 'Year of betrayal': Gammanpila
	
While claiming that 2017 would not be a prosperous year, Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) today charged the government had already planned to make 2017 the ?Year of Betrayal?.
Addressing a media briefing, PHU General Secretary MP Udaya Gammanpila said the people would have to face an unfortunate circumstance during this year with several actions of the government.
?As the first step of the ?Year of Betrayal? agenda, the government is willing to pass the new Constitution which is biased towards the Tamil separatism and Federalism. It would completely devastate the sovereignty of the country,? he said.
He said the second move of the government was to sign the ECTA (Economic and Technology Agreement) between Sri Lanka and India in March. He said it would risk the stability of all occupations in the country.
He said the government had also planned to sell many of the national assets to foreign forces during this year.
?The government has planned to sell off 80 per cent of the Hambantota Harbour to a Chinese company while oil tank farms in Trincomalee to be sold out to India. ? he said.
He also alleged the government had planned to sell the Eastern Terminal of the Colombo Harbour to the United States of America this year as another move of the government?s ?Year of Betrayal? agenda.

Range Bandara says he wants work
	
There was no point in remaining as a State Minister if a situation was not created for such Ministers to play an active role in the New Year, one of the State Ministers Palitha Range Bandara said over the week end.
?There is no point of State Ministers if no program is launched to assign them work, during this year,? Bandara told journalists who had met him at his office recently.
However, he was confident that President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe would draw up some plan to assign work for the State Ministers although they had failed to do it so far.
Range Bandara said steps had been taken to appoint Secretaries for the State Ministries but it would not do any good if they are not assigned any work.
?Some of the State Ministers are talented and can work creatively if they are given powers to work,? he said.
State Minister Range Bandara suggested that subjects should be allocated for the State Ministers through a Gazette notification.
?I will have to decide on a course of action if the State Ministers are neglected continuously,? he added.
State Minister Range Bandara made a similar complaint during his speech at the budget debate as well.(Yohan Perera)

Sarath Kumara Gunaratne arrested
	
Former Deputy Minister of Fisheries, Sarath Kumara Gunaratne was arrested by the Criminal Investigation Division (CID) a short while ago for the alleged misappropriation of Rs. 12 million.
Gunaratne was arrested on charges of misusing funds allocated for the development of the Negombo Lagoon during the previous regime.
Previously, Colombo Additional Magistrate Chandana Kulasuriya issued warrants against Guanaratne and five others in connection with the fraud.
However, the former deputy minister and four of the suspects did not reported to the CID on the appointed date. A supply manager at the Ceylon Fishery Harbours Corporation, one of the suspects, who came forward to record a statement was arrested by the CID.
Police said the remaining suspects had surrendered to court last month and had been granted bail along with the supply manager. However, the former minister had not responded to the warrants on either occasion. ?
The former deputy minister was also arrested in connection with an accident in which an individual was killed in 2002.(Darshana Sanjeewa)

Former deputy minister Sarath Kumara Gunaratne, arrested by the CID on charges of misappropriating Rs.12 million belonging the Negombo Fisheries Harbour Corporation, was today remanded till January 9 by Colombo Chief Magistrate Lal Bandara.
The CID had produced four suspects in court on the instructions of the Attorney General and that Mr. Gunaratne was the fifth suspect arrested in connection with the allegations with one more to be taken into custody.
Counsel Sampath Mendis appearing for Mr. Gunaratne requested bail for his client under exceptional circumstances considering the health condition of the suspect and his wife.
He said the report filed in court by the CID was erroneous and bad in law on the basis that the offence committed by the suspect had not been clearly stated.
The Chief Magistrate fixed the case for January 9 to consider bail for the suspect.
Earlier, four suspects -- former chairman Upali Chaminda, accountant Lakmini Munidasa, deputy general manager Piyal Abeysekera and deputy general manager Chaminda Palpita were released on bail under exceptional circumstances. (Shehan Chamika)

SL's ?Tell the President? facility will be using mobile app
	
Inspired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and US President Barack Obama, Sri Lanka?s ?Tell the President? will be using a special IT app to enable citizens communicating with the Presidential Secretariat to track action taken on their requests through the ministries and departments of the Central government in Colombo, Coordinating Secretary to the President Shiral Lakthilaka told Express on Monday.
Any person with an android mobile phone can install a special app which will enable him to lodge a complaint or make a request to the Presidential Secretariat in Colombo on any matter in which governmental action is needed and track the progress of action on his request, Lakthilaka said.
?SMSs will be sent to the person who had made the request, on the progress of his case. He will know which ministry, department or officer is handling it at any given point of time,? he explained.
?It is an all-Island project which will be inaugurated in Jaffna on January 4 by the President,? he added.
As of now, the public send their requests for action by letter and there is no knowing as to where the letter is going and who or where it is being attended to. Often there is no response, even if the request comes from the Provincial Council, as the chairman of the Northern Provincial Council, CVK. Sivagnanam, put it.
?We hope the new channel will make a difference,? Sivagnanam said.
The inauguration of the new phone app facility is part of President Sirisena?s plan to launch many development schemes throughout the island to mark the second anniversary of his assumption of office after winning the Presidential election on January 8, 2015.
While in Jaffna on January 4, the President will release more than a hundred acres of land which were seized during the war. On January 25, he will visit Mullaitivu district where he will attend to the needs of Tamil people who were directly affected by the last brutal phase of Eelam War IV.? He will also visit the Eastern province and the Central Highlands to discuss the problems of plantation workers of Indian Origin.

SLMC opposed to new electoral system
	
The Sri Lanka Muslim Congress (SLMC), backed by some other minority parties, is opposed to the proposed new electoral system, officials said yesterday.
A new electoral system called the "Mixed Member Proportional System" has been proposed and discussed by the Steering Committee working on constitutional proposals.
However, SLMC leader, Urban Development Minister Rauff Hakeem told Daily Mirror yesterday that his party was against it because, if enacted, it would be disadvantageous for the parties.
?The minor parties have some serious concerns about the electoral reforms,? he said.
He said his party had had talks with parties such as the Democratic People?s Front led by Minister Mano Ganeshan in this regard recently. The All Ceylon Makkal Party is yet another minority party which has reservations about the proposed system, he said.(Kelum Bandara)

?The overtures being made to us is a ploy to overcome challenges at the upcoming elections. We will not be duped for the second time. The clamour is for former president Mahinda Rajapaksa to lead the party at the elections,? SLPP Chairman G.L. Peiris said.
He said the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) was an appendage of the United National Party (UNP) pointed out that the people would rally behind the new political party.

State Bank of India cuts lending rate by 90 bps across maturities
	
REUTERS: State Bank of India, the country?s biggest lender by assets, said yesterday it had cut its lending rates by 90 basis points for maturities ranging from overnight to three-year tenures, after experiencing a surge in deposits.
After the move, its so-called overnight marginal cost of funds-based lending rate (MCLR) fell to 7.75 percent from 8.65 percent, while three-year loan rates will now be 8.15 percent from 9.05 percent previously.
The lending rates were also cut across other maturities effective yesterday.
Banks have received an estimated Rs.14.9 trillion (US $ 219.30 billion) in old Rs.500 and Rs.1,000 notes from depositors since the government on November 8 unexpectedly banned the banknotes in a bid to fight counterfeiting and bring unaccounted cash to the economy.
That had raised expectations banks would have room to cut lending rates, which is seen as vital to increase credit growth and spark a revival in private investments.
Although India?s gross domestic product grew 7.3 percent in the July-September quarter from a year earlier, the fastest pace of growth among large economies, much of that has been led by consumer demand.
Lower lending rates will be welcome by the Reserve Bank of India, which has cut the policy rate by 175 bps since the start of 2015 but has felt banks were being too slow in cutting their lending rates.
The SBI move also comes after Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday admonished banks to ?keep the poor, the lower middle class and the middle class at the focus of their activities,? and to act with the ?public interest? in mind.

## Title: The rainbow of Sayapethi Kusuma

The rainbow of Sayapethi Kusuma
	
Visakesa Chandrasekaram?s ?Sayapethi Kusuma? (Frangipani) is a landmark film in Sri Lanka, perhaps in the entire region.
Deepa Mehta?s Fire was about lesbian love, which may be put by some males in the same context as women?s cricket, women?s rugby or women?s brawls, something exotic and not of any real significance as far as they are concerned. Sex is traditionally seen as a male domain with women as junior partners.?
Anything that is strictly between women is OK but ?Sayapethi Kusuma? challenges male complacency by turning the whole thing upside down with a story about a heterosexual woman consenting to marry a gay man, and then kicking him out and marrying his bisexual friend, who finally opts to be gay.?
It?s a daring concept, more than enough to get cinemas stoned if it had been released when the previous macho regime, ? fuelled to the brim ?with rugby machismo, was in power.
As it was, the two cinemas (at Borella and Ratnapura) which dared to show this film were not stoned, nor were its actors attacked in the streets.?
All this augurs well not just for formula-driven Sri Lankan cinema but to Sri Lankan culture too, because both are lagging way behind the more enlightened parts of the world, when it comes to viewing and portraying sex-love. This is also true where the non-heterosexual sphere is concerned.?
In Western Europe (except Italy) gay marriage is now legal. In India, the Supreme Court is vehemently against it, and as Sayapethi Kusuma reaches its end the screen reminds us somberly that homosexuality still remains a punishable offense in Sri Lanka, a carryover from the England of Oscar Wilde.
"?Sayapethi Kusuma? is a moving drama, very well made considering that it?s the film maker?s debut effort, and much more sensitive in its portrayal of love and friendship than the recent, and much hyped, ?Motor Bicycle.?"
But more and more film makers all over the world now address this issue in artistic terms.?
The Indian film festival which screened this film is called the Kashish Mumbai Queer film Festival. That may sound like a peculiarly Indian sense of humour, but ? the phenomenon of the New Queer Cinema came to being in the 1990s, with filmmakers using the cinematic medium to tell stories about the post-AIDS experience.?
But none of these were Cannes quality movies. The first to get through that hurdle was Ang Lee in 2005 with his Western ?Brokeback Mountain? which won the Golden Lion at the Venice film festival. ?Far From Heaven? by Todd Haynes and Kimberley Pierce?s ?Boys Don?t Cry? too, are films which can be put into this genre but well above the New Queer Cinema average.
A film such as Brokeback Mountain ?would have been unthinkable in Hollywood three or four decades ago (few people knew that Rock Hudson was gay until he contracted HIV and died of AIDS). Today, LGBT stories can be made and distributed in the mainstream. That doesn?t mean that there is a rush of directors trying to mimic Ang Lee or Todd Haynes.?
"All this augurs well not just for formula-driven Sri Lankan cinema but to Sri Lankan culture too, because both are lagging way behind the more enlightened parts of the world, when it comes to viewing and portraying sex-love. This is also true where the non-heterosexual sphere is concerned"
?
The subject remains, shall we say, queer to many people. That?s why Sayapethi Kusuma is an important film for Sri Lanka. Thematically, it can be justifiably called the most daring film ever made by a Sri Lankan, (I have heard of an older film in which Joe Abeywickrema acted as a gay individual; unable to find a copy to watch, I?m unable to make a comparison).
Since the ?1990s, the term LGBT has been used to identify people who are lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender. But there is no call for a specifically LGBT cinema, because that would be make it an ?alternative? to the mainstream. The name ?Sayapethi Kusuma?, which means a flower with sex petals, seems to work against the concept of the film.?
Frangipani (araliya, botanical name plumeria rubra or plumeria obtusa) is a flower with five petals. In the film, one of the characters picks up an araliya flower and claims it has six petals. Hence, ?Sayapethi kusuma? implies that this particular flower is an aberration in nature. By implication, the sexuality portrayed in the film becomes that, too (someone can correct me if I?m wrong).
This is an obsolete view of same-gender sexuality. The modern view rejects the idea that gay sex is abnormal. But we are not here to discuss the psychology, biology or genetics of LGBT individuals. ?Sayapethi Kusuma? is a moving drama, very well made considering that it?s the film maker?s debut effort, and much more sensitive in its portrayal of love and friendship than the recent, and much hyped, ?Motor Bicycle.??
Chandrasekaram uses a minimalist but intimate style which recalls the cinematic art of Rainer Werner Fassbinder who, incidentally, was a gay filmmaker though he did not make that obvious in his thematically rich and complex films. Though their frustrations are obvious, the three main characters in this film (played by Dasun Pathirana, Jehan Sri Kanth and Yasodha Rasanduni) display a tenderness and sensitivity rarely witnessed in our ?heterosexual? cinema (girl-boy love story).?
There is a subsidiary transgender character ?Which leads to a sub-plot which looks unnecessary since the principal conflict has enough dramatic tension to hold the film together.?
The musical score by Shantha Pieris complements the storytelling and cinematography by Kularuwan Gamage, but its lack of thematic development limits its effectiveness.?
One problem, however, is that the screen looks dark much of the time. Whether this is due to what is known as underdevelopment in analog terms, or underexposure, it?s hard to say, but it certainly gets in the way of enjoying the film.?
Altogether, this is a remarkable first film, all the more so since it has the first lip kissing scene between two men in a Sri Lankan film to the best of my knowledge. In a country where lip kissing between a man and a woman won?t pass the film censor, it?s hard to understand how this came about. Either the censor board got unusually broad-minded, or we have made some progress in the right direction, albeit without knowing it ourselves.?

The last two compartments of the train had derailed and the coupling (a mechanism for connecting railway cars in a train) had uncoupled.
?About 25 to 30 railway sleepers had been damaged. Most probably the train services would be restored by tomorrow morning,? they said.

Unlucky strike
	
Lottery ticket sales agents in many parts of the country boycotted sales yesterday protesting against the price increase of tickets to Rs. 30.
They demanded prize amounts and their commissions be increased in line with the price increase. They claim that they should be paid Rs. 5.25 per ticket instead of Rs. 4 proposed by the National Lotteries Board (NLB).
They have also organised a huge demonstration in front of the Colombo Fort Railway station to be held tomorrow.
The lottery dealers in Kurunegala demonstrated on the streets of the town on Saturday carrying a coffin, a wreath and a poster which read "death of the lottery"
Earlier on December 29 the All Island Lottery Dealers Society (AILDS) had announced that they would stop selling lottery tickets from January 1 if the government does not withdraw its proposal to increase the price of a ticket to Rs.30.
AILDS Chairperson Krishantha Marambage said President Maithripala Sirisena should have intervened to resolve this matter because the increase in the price of a ticket would create a huge loss in the lottery ticket industry.
?It is not still clear who had decided to increase the price. We don?t know whether it is a decision of the Finance Ministry or the two lotteries boards,? he had said.
The lottery sellers argue that even at the rate of Rs 20, they found it difficult to sell the tickets, and were paying Rs 2.50 per ticket to street sellers.
Hence, they contended that they ended up with only Rs. 1 as sales commission. With that commission, they said that they had to pay their employees and cover other overheads.
However, NLB countered their argument saying that it gave many benefits to the lottery sellers, including life insurance cover, promotional work and materials.
The NLB also claimed that the board spent 50% of the total revenue as prizes, while 16% went to the consolidated fund. Another 15% was paid as Value Added Tax (VAT).(Kanchana Kumara Ariyadasa, Ranjith Rajapaksa and Pushpakumara Jayaratne, J.A.L.Jayasinghe)
