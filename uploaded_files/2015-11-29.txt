Foot-board travel on long distance trains banned
	
Long distance train passengers will be banned from travelling on foot-board with effect from December 01 as a preventive measure of possible accidents, Railway Department said today.
Chief Security Officer of the Railway Department Senaka Jayasena said the ban will be applied only for long distance train passengers and after the progress of the regulation is examined, it will also be applied to office train commuters.
"We know trains during peak hours are crowed. But, there are some passengers who have a habit of travelling on foot-board. That is why we decided to apply the regulation for the long distance train at the initial stage. If the ban is imposed for office commuters, we know it will result in a lot of chaos since it is not practical. During office hours in the morning and evening as well, trains are too crowded. However, we cannot let people travel in this way as it is too dangerous to travel on foot-board,? Mr. Jayasena told the Daily Mirror.
The Railway Department will deploy groups of railway inspectors to all five railway divisions in the country including the North, the East, Up-Country, Down South and two other Central divisions to supervise the new regulation.
Raids will be carried out by railway inspectors in trains during 24 hours.
According to the Railway Department?s Chief Security Officer, those who are found to be traveling on foot-board, violating the ban will have to face certain penalties in line with the Railway Act. (Piyumi Fonseka)
