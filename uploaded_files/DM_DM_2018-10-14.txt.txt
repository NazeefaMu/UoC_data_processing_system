Economic recession not only restricted to SL: President
	
President Maithripala Sirisena said the economic recession prevailing at present is not only restricted to Sri Lanka alone, but many countries in the world were facing this challenge.
Certain individuals issue statements saying that they could do what the government couldnt not, the President said and added that he requested them to work in a responsible manner for the benefit of the country and nation and not to make cheap rhetoric for their political expediency.
President Sirisena made these remarks at a ceremony held to vest the new administrative building to the people in Mahara yesterday.
Even though smaller countries like Sri Lanka are vulnerable to the effect of conflicts between world powers, steps are being taken in Sri Lanka at present through proper economic management to overcome those challenges, President Sirisena emphasized.
He said that when the politicians and public servants fulfil their respective duties free of fraud, corruption and malpractices, achieving the economic goals of the country would not be difficult.
We have to reinstate the exemplary characteristics we inherited from our proud history in our society. Our culture has given prominence to the indigenous products while becoming a self-sufficient nation, eliminating the habit of importing everything from foreign countries including even kites.
This new administrative building has been built with the objective of uplifting the living standard of the residents and trade community in the Mahara area, at a cost of Rs. 445 million.
President Sirisena also opened the newly built three-storied building at the Mahara District Secretariat, and this building was constructed at a cost of Rs. 50 million according to the government policy of streamlining and make efficient the public service.
Meanwhile, the President vested the newly constructed swimming pool at the Kirillawala Central College, with the students. This project was implemented by the Urban Development Authority under the Ministry of Megapolis and Western Development. The invested amount is Rs. 17 million.
Meanwhile, the newly built technology laboratory at the S.K.K. Suriyaarachchi Secondary School in Kadawata was also opened by the President.
Also, the awards ceremony of the Mahamaya BalikaVidyalaya was held under the patronage of the President. Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka, Deputy Minister Lasantha Alagiyawanna, Harshana Rajakaruna, the Chief Minister of Western Province Isura Devapriya, Piyasiri Wijenayake, Ranjith Somawansha and Prishantha Jayakodi participated.

Im nearing the end of my career: Lasith Malinga
	
Lasith Malinga, the veteran Sri Lankan pacer feels that he is nearing the end of his career and if he gets the chance to play the World Cup, it would be his last World Cup.
Im not expecting to get the chance, given the kinds of things that have happened to me over the recent past. But I will take it if it is given, said the 35-year-old Slinga.
Set back by fitness and weight-related problems, Malinga hasnt played too much for Sri Lanka of late. He played just 13 ODIs in 2017, and returned to the side for the Asia Cup recently after a gap of almost a year. But on Saturday, in Dambulla, he showed that he is still  arguably  Sri Lankas best short-format fast bowler.
In four games since coming back, he has picked up 10 wickets, reaching the milestone of 500 wickets in all formats of international cricket in the last game. But will he make the squad for the 2019 World Cup He isnt sure.
The selectors are entitled to make those decisions. Im just a player. My only job is to play when I get the chance, said Malinga. When I was out of the team, I went and played in Canada. I also played the district competition and got the highest wickets.
Thanks to those performances I got another chance at this level. Because Im nearing the end of my career, Im motivated to get wickets.
He had lost his pace in between, but has raised it again. With wickets coming too, Malinga should be in a reasonably good place. But he needs to keep the performances up if he wants to have that last splash at a World Cup  thats not certain yet. Being motivated should help.(Wisdem)

PM warns of the worse to come
	
Stating that the global economic crisis is turning to the worse, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe today stressed that government expected support of everyone to see the nation through from it.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said this at the opening of a new building at Bandaranaike Nawodya School and the opening of new divisional Secretariat office in Galgamuwa last morning.
 The oil prices went up initially as a result of high demand by countries such as China and India. They demanded more as their production went up. Also, economic sanctions imposed on Iran by USA and the high demand for oil as winter season approaches had also contributed to the crisis. US sanctions has a big impact as Iran produces 1.5 million barrels per day. On top of that economic collapse of Venezuela another oil manufacturing country has also worsened the situation. We have to face this situation the Prime Minister said.
 Some countries who have opted to stock oil had paid $ 90 a barrel while others are planning to pay $100 per barrel. These are counties which have a high export revenue. Countries such as Sri Lanka India and Pakistan has no high export revenue. Therefore we have to increase our export earning. We have to do it as there is no other option. Government has already curtailed imports but that cannot be done continuously he added.
 We hope all parties will shed their political differences and support the government to overcome this crisis. Anyone can criticize the government but that wont resolve the crisis he also said.
Further, the Prime Minister reiterated that harping on oil price formula will not help at this moment. Price formula involves unloading, storage cost, commissions of agents and other costs. There is no point in harping on it now he said. (Yohan Perera)

Wiggy asks TNA to lay down conditions
	
Northern Province Chief Minister C.V. Wigneswaran has suggested the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) to make the release of the Tamil prisoners detained under the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA) a condition for the party's support for the next year's national budget.
He expressed these views to the media after a meeting with the representatives of the Northern Provincial Council and the civil society organisations on Saturday.
He argued that those former top-level leaders of the LTTE such as Vinayagamoorthy Muralitharan alias Karuna Amman who gave orders to the ordinary LTTE cadres were at large while those youth implemented their orders were languishing in prisons for nearly 20 years. "We must take this point to the people" he stated.
We have decided during the discussion today to suggest the TNA to make the political prisoners' issue a condition to vote in support of the national budget, Wigneswaran said.
The National Convenor of the Movement for the Release of Political Prisoners, Fr. M. Shakthivel and Leader of the Peoples' Liberation Organisation of Tamil Eelam (PLOTE) and Parliamentarian Dharmalingam Siddharthan also participated in the discussion. (Romesh Madushanka)
