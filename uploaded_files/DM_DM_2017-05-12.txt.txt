A youthful fun turned into a lifelong deal
	
A mother who came in search of the whereabouts of a youth who had given his address to her young daughter, left her to be cared by the youth and returned home. It was reported from a village in the Western Province.
It was revealed that a group from a nearby town had set off on a pilgrimage and after travelling several hundred of miles from Colombo had stopped their vehicle at a wayside boutique for some quick purchases. A youth among the crowd had caught the attention of a pretty looking lass in the boutique assisting their parents.
It was 'love at first sight' for the youth who hurriedly wrote his address and stealthily passed it to the girl unnoticed by the others.
Next day, the touring party returned home. After a few days, the girl with her mother who had the young lad's address paid a surprise call at his house. The youth, after having seen her, was shocked and was unable to recollect what all that had taken place and became embarrassed as the secret was now known to everyone, when the girl said that she came to see him following the address that was given to her the other day. The girl's mother explained everything and by the time the episode drew closer, it was too late for the visitors to return home. As they had no alternative, stayed with the youths family.
The following day the youth was bewildered by another surprise when the girls mother told him to take care of her daughter and left her with him and went away.
The youths mother admonished her son and said if he had given addresses, have no alternatives but to marry her. The youth could not refuse his mother.
Neither the girls mother nor her family ever attended their marriage. (Pushpakumara Mallawarachchi)

Adl Capital secures US $ 10mn facility for LOLC Al-Falaah
	
LOLC Group Head of Islamic Finance Krishan Thilakaratne, LOLC Finance PLC Director/CEO Ashan Nissanka with Adl Capital Ltd Managing Director Ishrat Rauff and Adl Capital Ltd Associate Director Sabri Abdul Cader

Adl Capital Limited was successful in securing a US $ 10 million funding line for LOLC Finances Islamic business unit, Al-Falaah, from a leading Islamic financial institution based in the Middle East. 
Adl Capital Limited, acting as the lead arranger, is a company that specialises in advisory and structuring turnkey Islamic finance solutions to the local industry.
Commenting on the transaction, where the three-year facility would be channelled to meet Al-Falaahs growing asset portfolio, with a special focus on the small and medium enterprise (SME) sector, Adl Capital Limited Associate Director Sabri Abdul Cader said, LOLC Finance has been in the forefront of product innovation and has been a robust player in the Islamic finance industry for many years.
We are extremely delighted to be the lead facilitator in this pioneering transaction in order to support LOLC Al-Falaahs growth momentum. We believe that this transaction is the single largest bilateral transaction between an IFI-based overseas and an Islamic finance unit in the non-banking sector in Sri Lanka.
It is indeed an important milestone in our countrys 20-year history of Islamic finance. Given our long established relationships with Middle Eastern financial institutions and their interest for financing financial institutions in this region, we believe we are well poised to secure similar mandates from local institutions for cross-border financing.

This is a proud occasion not only for Al-Falaah but for the LOLC group and the country as a whole. I would like to commend Adl Capital for tirelessly assisting us in securing this funding facility that will undoubtedly be an added impetus to our growth momentum.

Buddha Dhamma provides solutions to our problems: President
	
President Maithripala Sirisena today stressed the need to build a stronger economy, a balanced legal system and restore peace among the various communities living in Sri Lanka and resolve global issues through the Buddha Dhamma.
The President said this when addressing the UN International Vesak Day celebrations in Colombo last morning with the participation of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi as the chief guest.
The message on the arrival of the Indian Premier in Sri Lanka and its objectives has been known to the world today through the International Vesak Day celebrations. The declaration of the International Vesak Day under the guidance of former president Chandrika Kumaratunga and efforts of our former Foreign Minister the late Lakshman Kadirgamar will help the world to understand its significance. Especially it will pave the way for non Buddhists to learn about Theravada Buddhism and about the Buddha. Buddhism is known as a way of calming the minds of Western politicians. This will be done by enhancing the knowledge of Buddhism among the Western Philosophers. As such the International Vesak Day is important for the whole world. Let us strive today to bring peace to the world, to resolve social uphevals and when it comes to our own nation lets us strive to bring peace among various ethnic groups and build a strong economy based and a better legal system based on the Buddha Dhamma, the President said. We all know that Buddhism has solutions to problems confronting Sri Lankans and those outside be it political, cultural or social. The Buddha taught that a person is judged by the way he lives and the character he or she develops. One cannot measure the guidance given by Buddhism to resolve issues, to make a person a just being and to bring the human qualities of a person to light.
The President said the historical relationship between Sri Lanka and India was based on Buddhist principles.
"This relationship which is associated with Buddhism has a long history. The Indian Prime Minister is here with us today with a Vesak message based on the birth enlightenment and the passing away of the Buddha. When we step into the future we can see the transformation of Buddhism by the Emperor Asoka, the arrival of Arahath Mahinda and Sangamita Therani. The Indian Premier has come with the same message today. Therefore I thank him for visiting Sri Lanka with the message of Buddhism, he said.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremeisnghe said the task before the UN Vesak conference is to deliberate on how Buddhist teaching can be applied to todays world and to resolve issues.
Today the global arms buildup has led to arsenals including weapons of mass destruction. These are available to a few countries, but very soon they may be in the hands of non-state actors. Consequently sustainable world peace is not only imperative but a pre-requisite to the existence of life in the planet. The task before you is to deliberate on how Buddhist teaching can be applied to todays world. When degenerate politics and selfish deeds have resulted in glaring inequalities between the rich and the poor, between the North and the South, between the powerful and the powerless, Buddhism shows a moderate path and the need to consolidate social justice, the Prime Minister said.

China mum over SL rejecting submarine docking
	
The Chinese Foreign Ministry has today parried questions on reports that Sri Lanka has rejected China's request for its submarine to dock at Colombo next week after a similar visit in 2014 triggered a strong protest from India, the PTI reported today.
"I have just read the relevant information. I suggest you raise it with the defence ministry for more details," Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said when asked whether China has expressed dissatisfaction to Sri Lanka for refusing to let its submarines to dock in Colombo port.
The remarks came as China gets ready to host Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe for the high-profile Silk Road summit on May 14-15.
"What I can tell you is that China and Sri Lanka enjoy traditional friendship. The two sides maintain sound cooperation in the fields of politics, economy, culture and military to military exchanges," Geng said.
According to PTI, China continues to pressure Sri Lanka for docking its submarines despite assertion by Sirisena government that it will not permit them due to concerns from India.
India has expressed concern over the previous Mahinda Rajapaksa's government for permitting a Chinese submarine in Colombo harbour in 2014.
China's request to dock its submarines coincided with the visit of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to Colombo.
China says it wants docking facilities for its submarines to take part in the anti-piracy operations in the Gulf of Aden.
PM Wickremesinghe and Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif are the only two top leaders from South Asia to attend the conference in which India is yet to confirm its participation owing to its objections to the USD 46 billion China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC).
The other South Asian countries would be represented by either ministerial or official level delegation. China is yet to release the list of delegates participating in the event.
During his visit, PM Wickremesinghe is expected to finalise the Hambantota Port deal as well as a Chinese free trade zone in the area which were stalled by public protests.

He envisioned a mind sans fear and a head held high
	
Rabindra Jayanti is an annually celebrated cultural festival, prevalent mostly among Bengalis and lovers of art worldwide, to mark the birth anniversary of Indian Poet and Nobel Laureate Rabindranath Tagore. In Sri Lanka Tagores 156th birth anniversary was marked by a commemoration event held at the main library of the Colombo University. The event organized by the Colombo Universitys Centre for Contemporary Indian Studies in collaboration with the Indian Cultural Centre on May 8 was graced by Indian High Commissioner Taranjit Singh Sandhu, the Colombo University Vice Chancellor Lakshman Dissanayake and faculty members including Prof. Sandagomi Coparahewa. At this event Rabindranath Tagores bust was garlanded by the High Commissioner while floral tributes were paid by the distinguished guests.
 
His short stories such as Kabulwala have been translated into several languages and have found their way into the curriculum of literary studies across the world, including Sri Lanka
Tagores influence in literary and musical culture across Asia is undoubtedly far-reaching. Although known mostly for his poetry, Tagore also penned novels, essays, travelogues and more than a thousand songs. His notable works such as Chandalika and Valmiki Pratibha were the first of their kind in this part of the hemisphere with its extended monologues, thickened and intricate sub-plots exploring philosophical narratives. His short stories such as Kabulwala have been translated into several languages and have found their way into the curriculum of literary studies across the world, including Sri Lanka. Kabulwala or the fruit seller from Kabul is a story of a Pathan merchant who has come to Calcutta to find work and sells fruit for a living. In the midst of his travails he befriends a five-year-old girl in Calcutta who reminds him of his own daughter back in Kabul. The soft nuances of seemingly guiltless plots such as these were one of Tagores many literary attributes.
High Commissioner Sandhu and Vice Chancellor Lakshman Dissanayake
Tagores most notable collection of prose, Gitanjali or song offerings was published in 1912 with an introduction from Irish poet William Butler Yeats. Yeats himself a pillar of Irish and British literary establishments could not seem to contain his awe and reverence for the enigma that was Tagore as is evident in his introduction to Gitanjali. He said, We have other poets, but none that are his equal. We call this the epoch of Rabindranath. No poet seems to me as famous in Europe as he is among us. He is as great in music as in poetry and his songs are sung from the West of India into Burma wherever Bengali is spoken. It is apparent that Yeats was as enthralled as he was with the completeness that is Tagore and was seemingly unaware of the developments a little south of India.
Samarakoon was a student at Tagores Viswa Bharati University, Shanti Niketan in India. Influenced by Tagore he returned to Sri Lanka after several months, changed his name to Ananda Samarakoon and embraced Buddhism

Tagores influence could hardly be contained as he was in amazement with life as much as life was deliberated by him. According to Prof. Sandagomi Copeahewa, who writes in his paper titled Tagores visits to Sri Lanka, among the many aspects of Tagores diverse personality was his fascination for travel. 
High Commissioner Sandhu pays tribute to Guru Dev Tagore
He kept his doors open to ideas from the East and the West, carrying a message of truth and love. Tagore visited more than a third of the countries in the world including Sri Lanka. In fact, his last overseas visit was to Sri Lanka. During his travels, Tagore explained his ideal of Visva Bharati and raised funds for its development and made a deep impact on the cultural life of the people, Coperahewa said. 
Attempting to discuss Tagores impact on Sri Lankan culture by examining ways Tagore interacted with the cultural personalities of that era, Coparahewa concludes that Rabindranath Tagore was the greatest foreign influence on Sri Lankan arts and culture in the twentieth century. He arrives at this conclusion taking into consideration Tagores great interest in the Sri Lankan people and his emotional attachment with Lankan history. 
According to scholars Tagores fascination with Sri Lankan seems to have been prompted by two factors: First the general belief that the Sinhalese -- the majority of Sri Lankans descended from immigrants from Bengal
Tagore was opposed to Imperialism and a vocal supporter of Indian nationalism. First revealed in his composition Manast he urged masses to escape the victimology and seek education and dependence upon self. Although it attracted initial criticism, in a British-controlled South Asia, he maintained that even for those in the extremes of poverty there can be no question of blind revolution. He preferred purposeful education instead, emboldened in his ideology of establishing Shanti Niketan.

Given this backdrop it comes as no surprise that the Sri Lankan national anthem too was a product guided by Tagores influence. One of the most notable features of Tagores influence would be his awestruck admirers. His multi-faceted genius displayed across his body of work in prose, music and also his philosophy of re-building lost glory of his nation, left us with the likes of Ananda Samarakoon. Egodagahage George Wilfred Alwis Samarakoon was a student at Tagores Viswa Bharati University, Shanti Niketan in India. Influenced by Tagore he returned to Sri Lanka after several months, changed his name to Ananda Samarakoon and embraced Buddhism. 
Upon his return to Mahinda College as an educator, Samarakoon wrote the now immortalized Namo Namo Matha and taught it to his students. Although not envisioned as a nomination for Ceylons new national anthem, it was formally adopted in 1951. From this point onward, Sri Lankan history depicts a rather tragic fate for the creator of our national anthem. Ensued in controversy the national anthem was changed because of an ill perceived gana sequence sans Samarakoons consent. The trifling query charge to tarnish Samarakoons story was that the inauspicious gana had an effect on Ceylons various misfortunes leaving Samarakoon oppressed with shattered spirit. Perhaps the events that unfolded were the only barriers before a flourishing nation Ceylon; a story of what could have been, had it been guided by the inspirational minds like that of Tagore. 
Chetto jetha bhoyoshunyo is one of Tagores politically charged compositions, prior to Indias independence, conveying his vision of an awakened country. It appeared as poem No: 35 in Gitanjali, Tagores Nobel Prize winning collection of prose published in 1912.
 His words immediately resonated in a South Asia chained by servitude to colonial masters. His call to awaken was carried far and wide through song and prose. Tagore himself recited the poem translated into English titled Indian Prayer at the Indian National Congress session in Calcutta. His call to strike a sleeping nation with no mercy struck Sri Lankas Mahagama Sekara who translated it as Mage deshaya awadikaranumena, piyaneni immortalized with the vocals of Pandit Amaradeva. 
Tagores sentiments were carried across the world by many who were in awe of his persona and shared his vision. According to scholars Tagores fascination with Sri Lankan seems to have been prompted by two factors: First the general belief that the Sinhalese -- the majority of Sri Lankans descended from immigrants from Bengal and the second, a profound respect for Theravada Buddhism and the Buddhist heritage of the island. (Dharmadasa, 2011:2)
 The enthusiasm created by Tagores visits to Sri Lanka was manifest in the formation of the Lanka Gandharva Sabha and the Tagore Society of Ceylon, established by his students at Shanti Niketan and Tagores admirers. His was the influence when oriental music was introduced to the Lankan curriculum in 1944, a breakthrough in Lankan education curriculum in its formative years. According to the activities of the youth who followed the light of Tagore at Shanti Niketan is the best way of assessing Tagores level of influence. These youth would include not only Samarakoon, but the likes of Ediriweera Sarachchandra, Sunil Shantha, Edwin Samaradiwakara and Chitrasena to name a few. They channelled the teachings of Tagore for the revival of Sri Lankan folk music, dance and drama, influenced by Rabindrasangeet. The first monk to be enrolled as a faculty member of the University of Ceylon the Rev. Udakendawala Saranankara was a social reformer inspired by the poet. 
During one of Tagores visits to Colombo in 1934, he said As a poet, it is my passion to restore that ancient association of mind through my efforts that speak through a direct language of art. It is our fervent hope that his vision lives on in the minds of kindred spirits in the years to come.

HNB Al Najah bags multiple Golds at SLIBFI Awards 2017
	

HNB Al Najah, Hatton National Banks (HNB) Islamic banking business, extended its market leadership position, securing two Gold awards together with two Bronze awards at the annual awards ceremony of the Sri Lanka Islamic Banking and Finance Industry (SLIBFI).
HNB Al Najah won the Gold award for Islamic Finance Window/Unit of the Year and Islamic Finance Deal of the Year, together with a Bronze award for Islamic Finance Entity of the Year.
Public Enterprises Development Minister Kabir Hashim served as the chief guest at the event.
Rizwan Sabireen of HNB Al Najah was also awarded a Bronze award for Islamic Finance Rising Personality of the Year - an award presented to individuals under the age of 35 in recognition of significant contributions towards the development of Islamic finance in the country.
Having only just recently celebrated its fifth anniversary in February, HNB Al Najah stands as a first rate example of a successful business that has grown rapidly to become a true leader in the field of Islamic finance in Sri Lanka.
Drawing attention to the companys tremendous success in such a short span of time, HNB Head of Islamic Banking Hisham Ally explained how from the outset, HNBs goal was to become the market leader in Sharia-compliant banking solutions in Sri Lanka. It has been a great honour to have won such strong recognition for our work by the SLIBFI. Having successfully demonstrated HNB Al Najahs ability to be the preferred choice for Islamic finance in Sri Lanka, we are confident that we will be able to achieve significant growth and play a leading role in the continued development of Sharia-compliant products for the domestic market in the future, he stated. HNB Al Najah offers a wide range of Sharia-compliant products and services to cater to the varied requirements of retail, SME and corporate segments of the market. The uniqueness of HNB Al Najah is that these services could be availed through any of the banks branch network seamlessly even though the operations of the Islamic banking business are centralized at its main office in Bambalapitiya.
HNBs Islamic banking business in its short span of existence, has recorded remarkable industry best performances in terms of profitability, growth and market share, whilst maintaining a high-quality lending portfolio with zero NPA. Being a window unit of a conventional banking business, these achievements are a reflection of HNBs investment commitment to the Islamic banking industry to support and develop this valued customer segment.
To further broad base Islamic financing in Sri Lanka, HNB Al Najah recently set up three specialized units in Pettah, Kalmunai and Kandy catering to the needs of Islamic financing. Kalmunai and Kandy units were opened with the objective of serving the entire East and Central regions.
HNB Al Najah also operates a foreign currency banking unit (FCBU) in order to fund overseas and local projects. A large number of benchmark transactions were structured in the FCBU in 2016 to support the development of the Islamic banking business in the country. DGM Corporate Banking Ruwan Manatunga articulated that HNB Al Najah, headed by Hisham Ally - a veteran banker with many years of Shariah banking experience behind him, along with his accomplished team, in a short period of time has established a proven track record and a leadership position in the Islamic banking space. Manatunga also reiterated HNBs commitment to the further development of Islamic banking in Sri Lanka adding that the bank would continue to strengthen its investments towards product depth and service offering in order to provide a world-class Islamic banking experience to its esteemed customers. 
Backed by HNBs superior infrastructure and strong branch network, HNB Al Najah is well positioned to be the benchmark in Shariah-compliant banking in Sri Lanka, in alignment with the banks core objective of being the leading banking and financing house in the country.

Indian top court examines Islamic instant divorce
	

NEW DELHI AFP May11, 2017 
Indias highest court Thursday began considering the legality of a controversial Islamic practice that allows men to leave their wives instantly by reciting the word divorce three times. 
Triple talaq is legal for Muslims under the Indian constitution but it has come under scrutiny with reports emerging of men divorcing their wives via letters, Skype and WhatsApp messages. 
Several women divorced by triple talaq have petitioned the Supreme Court to overturn the practice. 
We told the court that the practice has no basis in the law or in the Koran, said Balaji Srinivasan, a lawyer for Shayara Bano whose husband split from her by writing divorce three times on a piece of paper. 
The practice has been challenged in lower courts but this collective appeal is the first time Indias Supreme Court will consider whether triple talaq is fundamental to Islam and therefore legally binding. 
A panel of five judges from Indias major faiths -- Hinduism, Christianity, Islam, Sikhism and Zoroastrianism -- will consider the matter and is expected to deliver a verdict next week.

Lankan accused of killing wife in Canada, wants to be deported
	
A Sri Lankan refugee in Canada, who was charged with murdering his wife, has told the Immigration and Refugee Board during his detention hearing on Thursday that he wants to be deported back to Sri Lanka, Toronto Sun reported on Friday.
The refugee, Sivaloganathan Thanabalasingam, has said that he no longer fears returning to home country.
I dont have any kids, I dont have anything in Criminal Code or immigration code, he said. So I dont know why Im still in jail. Thats what Im thinking ... to go back to my country.
Thanabalasingam, 31, was charged with second-degree murder in the slaying of his 21-year-old wife, Anuja Baskaran.
The charge was stayed in April after the length of the proceedings was deemed to have violated a recent Supreme Court of Canada ruling that set time limits for trials to be completed.
He became the first murder suspect in Quebec to be set free as a consequence of the court ruling, known as the Jordan decision.
Crown officials in Quebec are appealing the Superior Court decision that stayed the proceedings. Despite being set free, Thanabalasingam was never released from custody.
After the stay, he was promptly rearrested by Canada Border Services Agency and ordered deported by the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada.
Thanabalasingam is still protected by Canada as a refugee, so it is unclear if and how he will be deported.

Modi addressing one ethnicity a slight on Buddhism: NJC
	
Indian premier Narendra Modi addressing just one ethnicity during his visit was a slight to the majority Buddhist population in the country, the National Joint Committee (NJC) said today.
Member of the committee Ven. Elle Gunawansa Thera said they had no issues with the Indian government or its Prime Minister. We do have an issue with the Sri Lankan government, the Thera said.
The government sometimes moves towards India, sometimes towards China or America. We would like to remind the government that this is a country and not something that can be auctioned to other countries or parties, the Thera said.
The citizens have a responsibility to protect the country and its assets, the Thera explained. People can come here as they want but they cannot sell or break any part of the country as they please, the Thera said.
The ETCA would lead to unemployment not just among the Sinhalese but also among the Estate tamil population, the Thera explained.
Tamil is also an official language in the country now. We were never against this. The move made by the Prime Minister will only destroy the reconciliation fought for by the people, the Thera said.
The government had a responsibility to protect the independence and sovereignty of the country, therefore the government should publicize the agreements signed with India. Hiding these agreements leads us to believe that they are not advantageous to the country, the Thera said.
Politicians will gamble at the expense of the country, but if they were to lose the bet it would be the citizens who would have to bear the brunt of the cost, the Thera said. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

Replace health minister with someone who understands job: GMOA
	
The Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) today urged President Maithripala Sirisena to appoint someone who has a better understanding of the responsibilities of a Health Minister to the post, without further risking the health-care services of the country.
GMOA Secretary Dr. Naveen De Soyza told a news conference that the President should either advice Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne to solve the issues within the health sector with the assistant of the related parties, or else he should appoint a new health minister. We have to reiterate the fact that the behavior of Minister Senaratne has put the health sector as well as patients lives at risk. We hope that the President would intervene to solve this matter in a positive way, he said.
GMOA Assistant Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge alleged that Minister Senaratne was more concerned about what was taking place with regards to the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) in Malabe than issues concerning his ministry.
The country is facing a huge issue with a rise in the number of dengue cases being reported from several areas including the Colombo suburbs, Trincomalee, Jaffna and Hambantota. About 35 fatalities from dengue were reported in the Western Province during the year, he said. Despite this, he claimed Minister Senaratne was still busy fussing about what was happening to the SAITM rather than concentrating on stopping the spread of dengue in the country.
He said that the fact that Minister Senaratne was biased towards the SAITM had been proved despite it being a private institute and added that the minister had continuously gone against the recommendations of the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC). The Health Ministry should reveal the exact facts about the death toll due to dengue that have taken place this year to the people, he said. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)

Strange pills, gel sachets found concealed inside undergarments
	
A group of displaced young girls of the Meethotamulla garbage tragedy complained yesterday that amongst a set of brassieres and underwear donated to them by an unknown lady contained a strange sachet of gel and some tablets.
The parents along with these girls who took shelter in the Paddy stores had found these strange pills and sachets concealed inside the undergarments donated by the lady. They said those were well stitched to the bras.
A 17-year-old girl who had received these undergarments said that an aunt who visited them with a big bag and called all the girls and emptied the contents of the bag which contained Brassieres.
"She said these are for young girls like us and not for the adults. I picked some and wore them and found nothing unusual, but however when washing them, I found that something like seeds that were stitched onto them. After notifying my mother, she cut open the Brassier and found some medicinal tablets and a sachet of gel concealed inside. I do not know what they are
This was confirmed by another woman as she said the woman who brought this had told the adults that these undergarments only fit the young girls and started distributing them among the girls.
With this disclosure, the residents were told not to wear and requested this matter be brought to the notice of the public. (Chithmi Chethari)

Strict disciplinarian and gentleman par excellence
	
Centenary birth anniversary of Bakeer Markar
The late Bakeer Markar was a politician and gentleman par excellence, a man worthy of emulation. In 1978, when I served as OIC Crimes of the Mannar Police, Mr. Markar as Speaker of Parliament visited the Mannar Peninsula and that is when I first set eyes on this distinguished gentleman. My older brother, Ibrahim Hamid, who later retired as a Senior Superintendent of Police, was attached to the Presidential Security Division and informed me that Mr. Markar wanted a bachelor and teetotaler for his Security Division. Since I had served in the North and East from 1973 to 1979, I felt it best to take a break and be close to my family in the process.
In 1979, I was transferred from Mannar to the Ministerial Security Division as Personal Security Officer to the Speaker. I reported for duty at Mumtaz Mahal, the official residence of the Speaker, and met his Private Secretary Mr. Azwer who introduced me to the Speaker in his office. Having first surveyed the inner and outer perimeters of the residence, I became well-acquainted with the place and able to carry out my duties. We had a team of five Police officers, a backup security jeep and motorcycle escort from the Traffic Police Headquarters. On our first visit to Parliament, as required, I did a thorough survey of the inner and outer perimeters of Parliament to gain first-hand knowledge for security coverage.
On the day after my arrival at the residence, I noticed a large crowd waiting to meet the Speaker, most of them from Beruwela. I briefed my men on their duties and proceeded to the office where the public were allowed to call on the Speaker. Some of those who were closely attached to the Speaker were unhappy about the security arrangements adopted by me as they were used to coming and going as they pleased and being scattered all over the residence. When we reached Parliament, I was summoned by the Speaker to his chambers. I was told that although he was satisfied with the security detail, it was necessary for me to ensure that the public were made comfortable when visiting for without them he would not have come to that position. It took some time for me to adjust but in time, I was gradually able to gain the confidence of those who visited the residence.
In accordance with tradition, Speakers were required to visit Parliament only when Parliament was sitting; in the first and third week of every month. However, Bakeer Markar visited Parliament regularly except for weekends and public holidays. Parliamentarians, who were under the jurisdiction of the Secretary of Parliament, gradually began to adjust to seeing the new Speaker constantly in Parliament and he won the hearts of all except for a few.
The Speaker was quick to detect some discrepancies in Parliament and made a written request to the Auditor General to have the Parliament audited. This was long overdue and to the surprise of the Parliament staff, all matters started functioning smoothly after the auditing.
All parliamentarians delegated to go abroad on official visits came under the purview of the Secretary General of Parliament. However, once Mr. Markar took charge of this subject, a roster was drawn to ensure that equal opportunities were given to all MPs to travel overseas on official duty. One day while in Parliament, the then Galle MP Mr. Albert Silva requested to see the Speaker and I accompanied him to the Speakers chamber. Mr. Silva bowed at the Speakers feet and was promptly asked to stand up. He then thanked the Speaker profusely in Sinhalese for the opportunity given to him to go abroad, bowed again and left smiling broadly. On one occasion, a senior Cabinet Minister requested permission from the Speaker to join a delegation proceeding to Geneva so he could visit a close relative. However, he was informed that his request could not be complied with and he would have to await his turn on the roster. The minister then fell out with the Speaker and did not speak with him till his term was over.
The routine of the Speaker was to visit Parliament on week days and the Beruwela electorate on weekends. Large gatherings from all walks of life were constantly seen at his Arab Road residence in Beruwela and each individual need was attended to, to their complete satisfaction. He was an extraordinary humanitarian, visited close friends and relations, attended weddings and funerals and went wherever and whenever he was needed. As President of the Muslim League Youth Front Youth at Heart, he travelled to the four corners of the country, continuously meeting people and giving redress to their needs. All petitions and requests were perused in his chambers and the relevant ministers were summoned to deal with and give redress to the humanitarian problems of all concerned.
While the new Parliament was under construction at Kotte, the Speaker visited whenever time permitted to look into its progress. While it was half way through, it was observed that according to the Construction plan, there was no floor allocated for the Speaker. This was brought to the notice of the President and Prime Minister who obliged by allocating the first floor to the office of the Speaker. When the new Parliament was convened at Sri Jayewardenepura Kotte in 1982, many meetings were held pertaining to high security matters, chaired by the Speaker. On matters of security, the then ASP Mr. Milroy Cruz informed that in the old Parliament, police personnel were able to obtain meals at their convenience but this was not possible in the new Parliament due to security reasons and suggested that meals be provided by Parliament. The then Secretary General flatly refused to accede to this request, which made the Speaker question what duties were performed by the Police, which the Secretary General had to concede was providing security to Parliament. The Speaker then questioned whether that did not include providing security to all of us. The Speaker then made a ruling that the Parliament Police Division were to be given meals by Parliament. The entire Police Department thanked the Speaker profusely for this magnanimous humanitarian gesture.
Mr. Markar was the Founder President of the Iraq-Sri Lanka Friendship Association and held this position until his demise. He was closely connected with President Saddam Hussein and through that connection convinced the Iraqi Government to build the Saddam Hussein Village in Eravur for the cyclone victims in the Eastern Province. Mr. Markar was personally invited by the Iraqi Ambassador in Sri Lanka to participate at the annual Bath Party Anniversaries on behalf of President Saddam Hussein.
One evening in Parliament, the Speaker informed me that the President had summoned him for an urgent discussion in an hour and we had to proceed to the Presidents House. Half an hour after our arrival, the Speaker came out with a big smile and when I asked him on the way back what had happened, he informed me that the President had requested him to submit his resignation as Speaker to accommodate a Senior Cabinet Minister and that he had done so. I instantly replied that he should have contacted his supporters to get their views before making such a decision. He laughed at my naivet and said he strongly stood by Party decisions. After his resignation, he was sworn in as Minister without Portfolio and moved into one of the Stanmore Crescent residences. Though numerous calls and efforts were made to contact the Secretary to the President, we were eventually informed that he was not available. Finally, Mr. Markar told me that enough was enough and he was quite content to serve as Minister without Portfolio and serve the community at large.
After Mr. Premadasa became President, Mr. Markar was appointed Governor of the Southern Province and his staff started to shift his residence to Beruwela which turned out to be the Governors Residence too.
When the UNP returned to power in 1989, Mr. Imthiaz Bakeer Markar was sworn in as State Minister for Housing and used to visit Beruwela on weekends to meet members of the public. One morning, the Governor summoned me and in the presence of the State Minister requested me to take care of his security detail as I had done for him. I was aghast, my eyes filled with tears and I was speechless. I then said that when I get a capable officer to take charge of his security detail only, I would take the security of the minister. That was when I realised that the reason the Governor wanted me to do this was so I would be close to my family members in Colombo. This was yet another facet I discovered in you Sir, a man among men, a humanitarian act which I will never forget in my life, or the quintessence of the gentleman who performed it.
Sir, you epitomised a gentleman in every sense of the word, thank you for what we are today because of what we learned from you. You taught us not to limit our challenges, but to challenge our limits!

The circle and the Mexican hat
	
Theres a story about a teacher and some children that offers a fitting metaphor for our political landscape. This teacher had drawn a circle. He had asked his assistant to describe it. A circle, of course! was that assistants reply. He had then asked the children to describe it. Three replies had followed: that it was a lima bean, that it was a cowboy, and that it was a Mexican hat. 
Whether a circle resembles either of these is beside the point. Children are creative. They see what we dont. They like to unveil, sometimes undress. On the other hand, when a set of adults confuse circles for Mexican hats, they arent being creative. Theyre being evasive. And dodgy. Its bad enough when these adults are supposed to be informed. Its worse when they happen to be political commentators.

Our government has seen better days. Better is of course a relative construct, but for the moment lets forget that. Whats important here is that the euphoria that greeted Maithripala Sirisena and Ranil Wickremesinghe in 2015 has died down. This has everything to do with the incumbent and not so much with the Joint Opposition. That latter point is important, because no regime before the present one here has become so unpopular both for what it does and for what it does not do. 
Consider the May Day fiasco. The president and the prime minister were handed an opportunity to upend Mahinda Rajapaksas legitimacy. They denied that opportunity to themselves and their cohorts when they raised speculation as to whether theyd ban the Joint Opposition from holding its rally at Galle Face, allowed it to go ahead with that rally, and shot themselves in the foot when the Rajapaksas held the biggest such May Day turnout and the JO subtly made it look as though the government had let it hold its meeting as a challenge which it (the government) obviously lost. 
What did the Joint Opposition do Nothing. What did the regime do Everything. That is why, at the end of the day, forgetting those hilarious claims and counterclaims made by a larger-than-life oppositional movement, it is the government that is to blame for what it does to itself. Lets not forget, after all, that no less a figure than Mahinda Rajapaksa entertained doubts as to the size of the crowds for his rally and tried to fix the stage in the middle of Galle Face so as to soften the threat of a low turnout. The police prevented him from going ahead. The fact that he won speaks volumes about whos propping up whom in our political sphere.
Our government has seen better days. Better is of course a relative construct, but for the moment lets forget that. Whats important here is that the euphoria that greeted Maithripala Sirisena and Ranil Wickremesinghe in 2015 has died down 
Considering all these, one can glean some points. Pertinent points. First and foremost, our political dynamism has been toned down to a series of predictable events: the government lambasts the Joint Opposition, the JVP dismisses both it and the government, the latter challenges Mahinda to better it, gets politically creamed by his cabal, and then tries to dodge those hard-to-dodge realities by engaging in conjecture.
Crowds heading towards the Joint Opposition May Day rally at Galle Face Green 
Secondly, this process (which is so simplistic that theres little space for any of those other, more pertinent issues ailing the country) is facilitated by an even more simplistic set of responses by those who vouch for the regime. Malinda Seneviratne, in his column last week, underlined the fiasco sections of the government led themselves to when they swore vengeance on the Rajapaksas and their cohorts. He could have found a confirmation of this with the reactions given by unabashed yahapalanists towards the Galle Face rally. 
Considering all these, one can glean some points. Pertinent points. First and foremost, our political dynamism has been toned down to a series of predictable events
These responses, broadly speaking, fall into either of two categories. The first downplays the significance of the turnout. The second accepts that significance but downplays the political relevance of the JO. So when Shyamon Jayasinghe argues that the the totality of the crowds of the other three meetings would have exceeded Mahindas rally and rebukes Sarath de Alwis (who, by the way, is no Mahinda lover), he is not only making that first kind of response, he is also showing that hes willing to debate with even those ideologically opposed to the Rajapaksas with crass, numerically unsound assertions. When this same yahalapalanist is roundly routed by Alwis and then fires back Rajapaksa should be arrested, we can only side with Alwis as he infers how that he and his ilk prefer delusion to truth.

On the other hand, when Jehan Perera contends rather lucidly that the JO rally showed the willingness of the present government to allow space to everyone in the polity to discuss and debate but also showed its inability to obtain mileage from its democratic credentials, he is making the second kind of response while ignoring the fact that this willingness had less to do with democratic credentials than a miscalculated gamble that Mahinda Rajapaksa would fall flat on his face with a low turnout. I am of course not denying that political decisions must sometimes be assessed on the basis of outcome, not intention, but I wonder: does that willingness explain that erroneous remark by Rajitha Senaratne that Sarath Fonseka would be given a new position to contain (inter alia) strike action and protests 
Its hilarious, in a Beckettian sense almost, that none of these pundits seems to have inferred the political reality: that there was a crowd, that this crowd filled Galle Face Green, and that Galle Face Green is bigger than Getambe and Campbell Park combined. That even Rajapaksa was unsure about how many would attend speaks volumes about how even the JO is unaware of the intense hatred against the regime. 
Theres little that can be said about the political worth of the SLFP and the UNP. The JVP is losing what legitimacy it had with a propped up leadership that shows one face to the parliament and another to the public. The TNA is less concerned about the country than an ethnic constituency thereof. The Old Left shows itself as a kingmaker to the Rajapaksa Cabal when it is not. Barring Dinesh Gunawardena and a few other committed loyalists, the Joint Opposition has for the most done nothing. When a political force that does absolutely nothing gains mileage over a regime that tries to do everything, you know whos calling up the numbers and the popularity and whos not. 

I know what those wholl (grudgingly) accept this say: that this regime is headed by doers, not populists. Thats a cop-out of the worst sort, not because we need populists but because those in power are not doers by any stretch of the imagination. Political doers do. They dont talk shop. This government likes to talk shop. For the most. And as Kishali Pinto-Jayawardena (again, no Mahinda lover) succinctly puts it, the same civil society that was instrumental in getting the Rajapaksas out have been weakening since 2015. That, more than anything else, should point at whats in the circle. If those who vouch for this regime prefer to look away, perhaps what they need is another set of children, this time to make them see what the Emperor is (not) wearing.

The ideal life and never-ending rat race
	

For many of those who are bogged down with day-to-day responsibilities, serving humanity looks like quite a tall order
	People yearn for something or someone to tell them how to live the life on ideal terms so that they would feel secure and content
Despite marked improvements in living standards, life expectancy and technology, the people of today seem to be more disillusioned and insecure than before. This includes the rich and the poor, the political elite and the powerless.
There is a definite palpable and all-pervading feeling of helplessness. People feel they miss life for the rat race. They yearn for something or someone to tell them how to live the life on ideal terms so that they would feel secure and content. This feeling is shared by billions across the globe, from the United States to China and Iceland to the South Sandwich Islands.
Neither the capitalist U.S. nor the state-controlled capitalist China or Russia nor any other political system has been able to offer what the man wants most  a meaning to life.
I suppose the plight of man in todays world is best summed up by the following quote attributed to The Dalai Lama. When asked by someone what amazes him the most about humanity, the spiritual leader replied, Man. Because he sacrifices his health in order to make money. Then, he sacrifices money to recuperate his health. And then he is so anxious about the future that he does not enjoy the present; the result being that he does not live in the present or the future; he lives as if he is never going to die, and that he dies having never really lived.
Time certainly flies. We grow old every second. Yet, are we really living our lives in a meaningful way Is there a value for our life Arent we just getting too busy with our daily chores that we hardly have time even to stop and think about the purpose of life These are the questions one often asks.
The meaning of life is to serve humanity, said Leo Tolstoy. But, for many of those who are bogged down with day-to-day responsibilities, serving humanity looks like quite a tall order.
One feels that not everyone is driven to serve humanity, not unless one is as noble as Mother Theresa or Florence Nightingale. However, if this means helping each other in daily work or running an errand for an elderly neighbour, well that certainly is much less daunting.
After all, as Jean Jacques Rousseau said, What wisdom can you find that is greater than kindness. Kindness surely is the crowning glory of humanity. The human race would not have survived this far if everyone were unashamedly selfish and did not look beyond ones walls. The civilization has survived because of those who looked for solutions for its ills  health issues, moral degradation, political turmoil, natural catastrophes and many others.
While technology has helped man out of his many troubles, it has also kept him busy and distracted as never before.
Life is really simple. But we insist on making it complicated, said Confucius 2,500 years ago. The 25 centuries that followed had seen man making life more and more complicated that it is fast becoming almost unbearable. The simplicity is long lost.
Living the moment, according to Buddha, takes most of the burden out of the mans shoulder. The Enlightened One insisted that one should neither mourn the past nor worry about the future. The modern science has proven beyond doubt that mindfulness (Sati in Pali) espoused by Buddha contributes to greater well-being of man, and mindfulness based treatment is being recommended for mental ailments as a therapeutic application.
Accept the present moment as if you had invited it. It is all we ever have so we might as well work with it rather than struggling against it. We might as well make it our friend and teacher rather than our enemy, says New York born Buddhist nun Ven. Pema Chodron. When living mindfully, we get space to gauge our intentions. The honesty of our intentions in everything we do is vital as the value of our life is totally dependent on our intentions.
Leading Washington based Buddhist nun Ven. Thubten Chodron (Cherry Greene) insists that a good ethical conduct with right motivations form the foundation for a meaningful life.
When we keep good ethical conduct and are able to examine our motivations and let go of the corrupt ones and have kind motivations, we feel happier within ourselves and when we feel happier within ourselves, then our craving for external things decreases considerably, Ven. Chodron observes in her writings.
Needless to say that a good ethical conduct also prevents us from falling into many pitfalls in life.
Ven. Chodron holds that people today are under the misconception that what they do to gain others appreciation decides the value of life.
Having a good reputation, money, success, being famous, having love, praise, appreciationthese things get us absolutely nowhere in terms of our Dharma aims. Were so habituated to, Well, if I do something outside and outside appreciates it, then my life is worthwhile. But the whole thing about karma isthe karmic value of an action isnt how other people see it and respond to it. The karmic value is our own intention and that comes only from us, Venerable Chodron points out. So being famous, having money and prestige that stuff doesnt increase our good karma at all is zero, adds the Venerable Bhikkhuni.  The problem with people, the Venerable Bhikkhuni says, is that they are being too hooked on to the external world and having a lot of attachment and craving for objects that seem to spark pleasant feelings.
She explains that what people are attached to, actually are the pleasant feelings. Under the notion that the objects seem to bring pleasant feelings, they get attached to the object. That has its disadvantages in the sense that then our happiness is always dependent on external people and things, which we cannot control. Whereas in our Dharma practice, what were trying to do is develop ourselves internally so that were happy with whatever is happening at the moment and arent so moved around by external people and external things. That gives us a lot more emotional stability, she points out. The best giving is the absence of possessiveness. When we clutch onto things, we want everything to be fixed and permanent. When we arent possessive, were more in tune with the reality of things arising due to causes and conditions and disappearing, changing into something else, due to causes and conditions. The more we can accept that flux, the more at ease our mind is, the less fear we have, and the more peaceful we are, Ven. Chodron observes.

Trumps anger over Russia probe thrusts White House into new tumult
	

Every time FBI Director James B. Comey appeared in public, an ever-watchful President Trump grew increasingly agitated that the topic was the one that he was most desperate to avoid: Russia. 
Trump had long questioned Comeys loyalty and judgment, and was infuriated by what he viewed as the directors lack of action in recent weeks on leaks from within the federal government. By last weekend, he had made up his mind: Comey had to go. 
At his golf course in Bedminster, N.J., Trump groused over Comeys latest congressional testimony, which he thought was strange, and grew impatient with what he viewed as his sanctimony, according to White House officials. Comey, Trump figured, was using the Russia probe to become a martyr. 
Back at work Monday morning in Washington, Trump told Vice President Pence and several senior aides  Reince Priebus, Stephen K. Bannon and Donald McGahn, among others  that he was ready to move on Comey. First, though, he wanted to talk with Attorney General Jeff Sessions, his trusted confidant, and Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein, to whom Comey reported directly. Trump summoned the two of them to the White House for a meeting, according to a person close to the White House. 
The president already had decided to fire Comey, according to this person. But in the meeting, several White House officials said Trump gave Sessions and Rosenstein a directive: to explain in writing the case against Comey.

CNN reported Acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe disputed Thursday the White Houses assertion that FBI employees had lost faith in James Comey, saying the former FBI chief had broad support within the agency.I hold Director Comey in the absolute highest regard. I have the highest respect for his considerable abilities and his integrity, McCabe told members of the Senate intelligence committee.He said Comey enjoyed broad support within the FBI and still does to this day. He added, The majority, the vast majority of FBI employees enjoyed a deep, positive connection to Director Comey. 
On Wednesday, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, a White House spokeswoman, said that the President and the rest of the FBI had lost confidence in Comey. She said the White House had heard from countless members of the FBI to that effect.

Turkey warns US of blowback from decision to arm Kurdish fighters

Turkey warned the United States on Wednesday that a decision to arm Kurdish forces fighting Islamic State in Syria could end up hurting Washington, and accused its NATO ally of siding with terrorists. 
The rebuke came a week before President Tayyip Erdogan is due in Washington for his first meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump, who approved the arms supply to support a campaign to retake the Syrian city of Raqqa from Islamic State. 
Turkey views the YPG as the Syrian extension of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), which has fought an insurgency in southeast Turkey since 1984 and is considered a terrorist group by the United States, Turkeyand Europe. 
We want to believe that our allies will prefer to side with us, not with a terrorist organization, Erdogan told a news conference in Ankara, saying he would convey Turkeys stance to Trump next week and at a NATO summit later this month.
