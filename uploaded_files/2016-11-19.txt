IMF approves US$162.6 Mn Disbursement to Sri Lanka
	
International Monetary Fund (IMF) said in a statement that its Executive Board has completed the first review of Sri Lanka?s Extended Fund Facility (EFF) arrangement, which enables the disbursement of about US$162.6 million.
The reinstatement of the amendments to the value added tax will help boost revenues, while the 2017 budget proposal should strengthen government finances, the statement said.
On November 18, 2016, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) completed the first review of Sri Lanka?s economic performance under the program supported by a three-year extended arrangement under the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) arrangement. Completion of the review enables the disbursement of the equivalent of SDR 119.894 million (about US$ 162.6 million), bringing total disbursements under the arrangement to the equivalent of SDR 239.788 million (about US$ 325.1 million).
Sri Lanka?s three-year extended arrangement was approved on June 3, 2016 in the amount of about SDR 1.1 billion (US$1.45 billion, or 185 percent of quota in the IMF at that time. The government?s reform program, supported by the IMF, aims to reduce the fiscal deficit, rebuild foreign exchange reserves, and introduce a simpler, more equitable tax system to restore macroeconomic stability and promote inclusive growth.
Following the Executive Board?s discussion of the review, Mr. Tao Zhang, Acting Chair and Deputy Managing Director, said:
?Sri Lanka?s performance under the Fund-supported program has been broadly satisfactory despite challenging circumstances. Macroeconomic and financial conditions have begun to stabilize, inflation has trended down, and the balance of payments has improved. Meanwhile, international reserves remain below comfortable levels.
?Fiscal performance has been encouraging. The reinstatement of the amendments to the value added tax will help boost revenues. The 2017 budget proposal aims to strengthen government finances through revenue mobilization, while guarding against revenue shortfalls by aligning spending with revenue on a quarterly basis. The new Inland Revenue Act scheduled for early next year should result in a more efficient, transparent, and broad-based tax system. Complementary structural reforms in tax administration, public financial management, and the governance and oversight of state-owned enterprises are critical for durable fiscal consolidation.
?While inflation has abated, credit growth remains strong. The central bank indicates its readiness to tighten the monetary policy stance further if inflationary pressures resurge or credit growth persists. The authorities intend to continue building up reserves through outright purchases while allowing for greater exchange rate flexibility.
?The banking sector is currently well capitalized. Steps are being taken to find a resolution mechanism for the distressed financial institutions. Going forward, there is a need to strengthen the supervisory and regulatory framework, and identify and mitigate vulnerabilities in the financial sector, particularly with regard to non-banks and state-owned banks.?

Muslim Council deplores Wijedasa?s statement on ISIS
	
The Muslim Council of Sri Lanka (MCSL) said today it was seriously concerned about the statement made in Parliament by Justice Minister Wijedasa Rajapaksa about the Muslim community.
MCSL said in a statement that they strongly objected to the misplaced statement by the minister as facts given by him were reported in the media more than one year ago when a Sri Lankan combatant died fighting with ISIS and added that there have been no new reports of any others involved after this incident.
?It is believed that one family had gone to Syria to provide humanitarian support to the war wounded and refugees. Some of the men are alleged to have joined or forced to join the fighting forces of ISIS. The Muslim community, including the Muslim Council, Jamiathul Ulema and other organizations cooperated with the government in identifying the families to provide the necessary support for the intelligence agencies to investigate. Those who have gone to Syria as quoted by Mr. Rajapaksa include women and children,? the statement said.
It said Minister Rajapakse?s statement comes at a very opportune time to certain extremist elements bent on tarnishing the image of the Muslim community for reasons only best known to them.
?The Thableeq Jamath, Sunnath Jamath, Thowheed Jamath and Jamaithe Islam and several other organizations are all Muslim religious and social service organisations. They do not promote any form of violence as implied by the Minister Rajapaksa. Certain parts of his statement are verbatim of the hate speech spewed by the extremist priest Ven. Galagoda Aththe Gnanasara Thero,? MCSL President N. M. Ameen said.
He said the Muslims of Sri Lanka has a long history of peaceful co-existence and have stood with the Sri Lankans at good times and at times of adversity.
?The entire Muslim community has condemned the un-Islamic comments of the Secretary of the Sri Lanka Thowheed Jamath, Abdul Razick. Twenty-three Muslim Religious and Civil Society organizations headed by the All Ceylon Jamiathul Ulema issued a statement condemning the speech made by SLTJ?s,? he said.
?
He said as alleged by the Minister, no Muslim international school invites extremists to indoctrinate its children with fundamentalism.
? Such has been the language of certain countries who created terrorists out of Madrasas in Pakistan to achieve their own ends. We urge Hon. Wijedasa Rajapaksa to provide the evidence and take immediate action against anyone may have violated the laws of the land irrespective of ethnicity or religion,? Mr. Ameen challenged the Minister.
He said the Muslim community was seriously alarmed about the re-emergence of the racist campaign that was carried out by extremist Buddhist monks since the end of the war in 2009.
The statements made by the Hon Minster would only help to disturb peace and promote the interests of certain vested interests to destroy our country. We urge the Minister and the Government to investigate this and take appropriate action,? he said in a statement.

## Title: Nalini claims she was not aware of Rajiv Gandhi?s assassination plan

Nalini claims she was not aware of Rajiv Gandhi?s assassination plan
	
Rajiv Gandhi's assassin Nalini Sriharan, who is in jail for more than 25 years now, has claimed in her tell-all autobiography that neither she nor her husband was aware of the assassination plan of Rajiv Gandhi.
Sriharan, who is in jail for more than 25 years now, the world's longest serving woman prisoner, has put together the 500-page book in Tamil that will be released on November 24.
Nalini, who married LTTE operative Sriharan (Murugan) on April 21, 1991 after a brief courtship, was two months pregnant when arrested in connection with the May 21, 1991 assassination of Rajiv Gandhi. Housed in the special prison for women at Vellore in Tamil Nadu, Nalini is serving her life term along with six other accused.
In her autobiography, she lays bare her childhood, her affair with Murugan, circumstances under which she became witness to the assassination, her five-day run as an outlaw, arrest, torture in custody, birth of her child in jail, conviction and jail life. The climax is her 90-minute secret meeting with Priyanka Gandhi on March 19, 2008, which the world came to know through a TOI report on April 15, 2008.
Not many know it was Mahatma Gandhi who named Nalini's mother as Padmavathi, who was a nurse in a Chennai hospital when Sriharan, a Lankan Tamil, entered their lives while looking for a house on rent. Sivarasan made his entry soon after, since he, too, hailed from the same area as that of Sriharan. Within days, Sivarasan brought Dhanu, who later acted as the human bomb, and Subha. After the assassination, Nalini would say: "I was surrounded by blood-thirsty wolves."
Nalini says she is still in the dark about the real purpose of Priyanka's visit, but says it could be part of India's diplomacy to make Sri Lanka turn away from China's overtures. She says a day after the TOI report, then Sri Lanka President Mahinda Rajapakse's brother Basil Rajapakse rushed to India, stayed in Delhi for three days and cemented ties between the two nations.
Nalini's narrative of her 50-day ordeal in the custody of special investigation team (SIT) probing Rajiv assassination and the travails of her daughter Arithra born in jail, are not for the weak-hearted. Disrobed, punched in the chest, asked to make love with her husband in front of others, threatened with gang-rape by policemen, chained and kept in a 5X5 room for weeks, Nalini says she went through every possible third-degree torture in custody. Her pregnancy survived all this.
To make her sign on confession statements, police took her to a lady doctor for abortion. Nalini says she still regards the doctor as a goddess since she not just declined to abort but also gave a dressing down to the police officers.
Arithra, now a doctor in London, would wail without food in jail. Several jail officials gave her money and offered small help keeping the child in mind. She was then sent to Coimbatore, later to Sri Lanka from where she went to Europe by illegal ferries along with her uncles and aunts. While India denied her even student visa, though she was born Indian, the UK government offered asylum and assistance, helping her all the way to become a doctor now.
Her husband's real name is Sriharan, though police started calling him Murugan for reasons not known to her, Nalini says, adding that Sriharan had fasted for a total of 365 days in jail demanding various rights, including food and medical care for their child, visa for the child, and a name change.
Nalini says her life in jail was a little tolerable whenever Jayalalithaa was in power. The jail administration was a bit considerate during the AIADMK regime, she says. At several places in the autobiography, she says during the DMK government, the jail officials were harsh on her. In 2006, after the DMK returned to power, they threatened to 'arrest' her daughter if she was not immediately sent away to Sri Lanka, she says.
Nalini, when she was still a death row prisoner, wrote a letter to her daughter saying her last wish would be to spend a day with her and Sriharan. "I will cuddle you and say sorry to you for leaving you behind as an orphan in wilderness," she says. (The Times of India)

PUCSL unhappy over CEB delaying implementation of power plants
	
Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL) yesterday issued a directive expressing its grave concerns to the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB), over the delay in constructing power plants according to the approved Least Cost Long Term Generation Expansion Plan (LCLTGEP) and demanded an explanation for the same before November 29.
?The Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka approved the LCLTGEP on 15th of September 2016 and it is the sole responsibility of the Transmission licensee to adhere to the approved LCLTGEP and take immediate steps to implement it, given the critical nature of the power supply during the period 2017-2020.? the PUCSL said in a letter to the CEB.
It pointed out that the LCLTGEP was approved to ensure the future electricity demand was fulfilled and directed the transmission licensee to immediately construct and operate the power plants for the period of 2017 ? 2020, as per the approved plan to avoid the possible power shortages that could ensue during the period.
It however noted that the CEB had asked for more time with the implementation plan compared to the approved LCLTGEP.
?Critical plants to be built during the period of 2017-2020 have been delayed up to two years from the LCLTGEP which could ultimately result in not being able to meet the country?s electricity demand which in turn may create issues to the daily supply of electricity throughout the country,? the PUCSL said.
?Delays in building the power plants indicated in the LCLTGEP will result in failure to meet the electricity demand during 2017-2020 period,? the commission said.
The PUCSL had thus issued a directive to the CEB to submit reasons for the deviation from the approved LCLTGEP for each and every power plant, asking them to provide a report on the impact of the power situation during 2017-2020 as a result of deviating from the approved plan and asking them to provide solutions/proposals to meet the increased demand in case of a shortage in the future. They said this explanation should reach the commission before Nov. 29. (Ajith Siriwardana)
