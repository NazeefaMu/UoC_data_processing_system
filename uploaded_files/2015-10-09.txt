73 Lankan refugees return from India
	
Seventy three Lankan refugees sheltered in the special camps in Chennai were repatriated to Sri Lanka with the assistance of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) on Thursday, the Hindu said.
??We fled Vavuniya in 1990 fearing for our lives. I was nine years old when we came to Mandapam by boat. We want to go back because all our relatives are there,? says a mother of two, who was among the repatriated refugees.
Her husband returned to Lanka five months ago to see whether the situation in Mannar was conducive to them to resettle there. ?He said jobs in Sri Lanka are a problem. But we are confident of finding some livelihood as I have learnt tailoring. We will send our children to school there,?
For 26-year-old M. Prakash of Mandapam camp in Rameswaram, who came to Arichamunai by boat in 2007, concern over his future prompted him to decide to return.
?I have studied only till Class 10. Though there are schools here, my situation did not allow me to study and so I worked in a fishing company for a daily wage. I have saved some money but I can?t buy any land here as I will be a refugee as long as I live here,? the native of Jaffna points out. He intends to look for jobs in Malaysia or Singapore, once he returns to Sri Lanka.
Though the conflict between the government and the rebel forces ended on the island in May 2009, about 1.02 lakh refugees from Sri Lanka still remain in special camps across Tamil Nadu.
?We assist Sri Lankan refugees, who voluntarily decide to return to their home country. We help them in their documentation and facilitate and financially support their travel. On their arrival, UNHCR Sri Lanka provides some support to assist them in settling down,? UNHCR India's spokesperson Shuchita Mehta said.
Between 2002 and 2014, UNHCR India has assisted about 12,500 Lankan refugees in voluntary repatriation. Since January, a total of 315 refugees returned home.

EU praises SL govt. stance on death penalty
	
The European Union?s Mission in Sri Lanka today praised Justice Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapaksha?s announcement that Sri Lanka would vote in favour of the UN General Assembly resolution on a moratorium on the Death Penalty.
Issuing a joint statement in view with the International Day against the Death Penalty which falls today, the Mission said Death Penalty represents an unacceptable denial of human dignity and violates the right to life universally affirmed in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and reaffirmed in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights
?The death penalty is a cruel and ineffective punishment. The European Union, Norway and Switzerland oppose the Death Penalty in all circumstances. Its worldwide abolition is a priority there is no evidence to prove that the Death Penalty deters crime,? the statement said.
It further noted that that Death Penalty is irreversible and thus mistaken identity and wrongful convictions could also happen from death penalty.
?Many death sentences are issued after confessions obtained by torture. Innocent people die and a person more likely to be sentenced to death if they are poor or belong to an ethnic or religious minority,? it said.
Last year, at least 22 countries around the world carried out executions and at least 2,466 people were sentenced to death.
Many of those convicted spend years on Death Row, waiting to see if a reprieve will be granted. Sri Lanka currently has more than 400 prisoners under sentence of Death.
?Hundred and one countries have abolished the death penalty for all crimes. Make your voice heard for Sri Lanka to be part of the solution ? not part of the problem. Tweet #NoDeathPenalty,? the Mission requested.

Grade one classes to be limited to 35
	
The Education Ministry today stated that the Supreme Court order to limit Grade One classrooms to a maximum of 35 students will be enforced in government schools from 2017 by reducing the number of admissions annually.
Additional Secretary of the Education Ministry Mr. H.U. Prematilake said though the court order was obtained to cut the number of grade one students to 35, they had identified several problems that had arisen when the rule was practically implemented. Therefore, Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam had made a request to Cabinet regarding the issue, he said.
In the request, Minister Kariyawasam had asked the approval from Cabinet to allow the schools to keep their existing number of students until 2017.
Accordingly, the number of students will be cut from 2017, one by one annually till it reaches a maximum of 35, Education Ministry?s Additional Secretary Mr. H.U.Prematilake said. ?
?Most of the schools have not yet been developed. So, the parents seek popular schools which are well-developed. The main objective of limiting the number of students is to ensure quality education in schools. With the island-wide programme themed ?the nearest school is best school?, we will uplift all the schools. After the conclusion of the programme, it will be easy to keep the maximum number of Grade one students in to 35,? Mr. Prematilake said. (Piyumi Fonseka)

SL ranked sixth place in Global Impunity Index
	
Sri Lanka has moved to sixth place from fourth in the 2015 Global Impunity Index issued by the Committee to protect Journalists (CPJ).
?
The CPJ said in its report that the improvement due not to prosecutions-the island nation still maintains a perfect record of impunity in journalist slayings-but to the fact that no journalists have been murdered for their work since the end of civil war in 2009.
?So far, President Maithripala Sirisena, inaugurated in January this year, has demonstrated greater political will for justice than his predecessor, Mahinda Rajapaksa, under whose leadership nine media murders, including the five from this index period, took place.
In May, Sirisena pledged to reopen the investigations into journalists killed or disappeared during the last 30 years, naming the assassination of prominent editor Lasantha Wickramatunga and the disappearance of cartoonist Prageeth Eknelygoda as priority cases. Since then, at least seven army officers have been arrested in connection with Eknelygoda's case.
Wickramatunga's and all other killings remain unsolved.
Impunity Index Rating: 0.242 unsolved journalist murders per million inhabitants Last year: Ranked 4th with a rating of 0.443.

Tourism is one of the most important industries for a country not because one in eleven people are employed or because 1.8 billion people have travelled the to some part of the world. Why it is important is because Tourism is about new ideas, new themes and new dreams. This brings hope to a country and it's people. This is where Tourism becomes centre stage in today's Sri Lankan Economy said Dr Rohantha ?Athukorala Chairman of the Sri Lanka Tourism Promotion Bureau when launching one of the top dollar community aid Tourism project in Sri Lanka by 'Goodness for Hope' in the rural village of Sri Lanka in the presence of 4 times Olympic medallion and 11 times World Swimming Champion Melissa Franklin in the presence of it's founder and respected philanthropist Kushil Gunesekera at Seenigama with Laurieas Sports covering the event which will reach 200 million viewers globally.?Four time Olympic Gold Medallion training the Swimmers of Seenigama at the Brayan Adam Swimming Pool that was donated by the worlds top singer for $100,000?

Seenigama which is managed by Foundation for Godness was originated Kushil Gunesekera was the man behind the concept Community Aid Tourism. A new concept of travel for those people wanting a holiday that is a little bit different than the archetypal two weeks on a poolside sun lounger. We?ve realised that more people are open to the idea of a few days relaxing and a few days participating in really good grassroots community projects like the Foundation of Goodness voiced Kushil Gunesekera. It's all about creating real life-changing experiences and build long-term partnerships with people all around the world and that's what we do at Seenigama. For a year almost 2000 volunteer at the village which is why Sri Lanka Tourism is using this as a flagship project to drive this new concept of tourism voiced Chairman Athukorala
What is unique about Seenigama us that we see rural men and women learning web & graphic designing, electrical wiring, dress making, hair styling, English language and business development skills; mothers and their infants attending the Paediatric clinic; the village U13 cricket team playing against another school in the magnificent Seenigama Oval ? built with assistance from Surrey CCC ? that has been built alongside a 23-meter swimming pool donated by Bryan Adams makes Seenigama the ideal project to rev up Community Based Tourism in Sri Lanka opinioned Athukorala.
