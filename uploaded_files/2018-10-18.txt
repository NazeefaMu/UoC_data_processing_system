An -124, Boeing 737 land at MRIA
	
The world?s second largest cargo aircraft Antonov An-124 Ruslan and the twinjet passenger aircraft Boeing 737 landed at the Mattala Rajapaksa International Airport (MRIA), Airport Manager Upali Kalansuriya said.
Speaking to the Daily Mirror, Kalansuriya said the Antonov cargo aircraft touched down for refuelling and for a rest for the crew.
Mr Kalansuriya said, there were nineteen crew members onboard. The aircraft landed empty.
?It is an iconic to have the world?s second largest aircraft at MRIA and it is the second time that this aircraft arrived in the country. The aircraft arrived last afternoon from Prince Sultan Bin Abdulaziz Airport, Saudi Arabia and had left for Indonesia at 3.27 a.m. today,? he said.
The An-124 is the second largest production aircraft in the world, manufactured between 1982 and 2014. This aircraft is specifically designed for carrying heavy and bulky loads for long-range delivery and air-dropping heavy or bulky cargo, including machines, equipment and troops.
This same aircraft landed earlier on July 31 at MRIA for refueling and crew rest.
On April 19 the world?s largest cargo aircraft Antonov An-225 Mriya landed at MRIA. That aircraft arrived from Kuala Lumpur and left for Karachi, Pakistan.
Meanwhile, a Boeing 737 passenger aircraft landed at MRIA on Monday (15).
The aircraft arrived with a group of 56 tourists from Kerala and had scheduled left for Muscat this morning. (Chaturanga Samarawickrama)

Appreciation: Prof. A.J. Fernando DEATH OF AN UNFORGETTABLE, OUTSTANDING UNCLE
	
I woke this morning in Moscow with the news from my cousin Shehan de Tissera that one of the cleverest and perhaps the most outstanding members, and almost certainly the highest achiever of my family had died in Canada-- my mother Lakshmi Sylvia?s younger brother, my Athula maama. He indubitably rose to the highest possible level in his profession, globally: Prof. Athula Fernando (or Prof. AJ Fernando as he was internationally known), former Dean of the School of Medical Rehabilitation, University of Manitoba, was President of the World Confederation for Physical Therapy (WCPT)1991-1995.? ?
The three messages for the Centenary Year of the Chartered Society of Physiotherapy, UK, published in the Physiotherapy Journal, Jan 1994 Vol. 80, bore the names and signatures of the Prince of Wales, Baroness Robson and Prof. AJ Fernando. Athula maama?s message was typically laconic and from a lofty perch. It read:? ?
?Congratulations on your centenary: The work of the Chartered Society of Physiotherapy is a record of achievement. On behalf of the World Confederation of Physical Therapy, please accept warm and sincere good wishes for continued success??(signed) Prof. AJ Fernando, President WCPT.? AJ Fernando was the first ever President of the Confederation with Third World roots, being born and educated in Ceylon.??
Prof. Fernando graduated from the Medical College of the University of Colombo and obtained his doctorate from the University of Manchester.Athula maama was a scintillating public speaker and a cool dude who wore his hair long, dressed stylishly and drove the latest model Porsche into his 80s. Highly literate (like his very widely read father?my maternal grandfather, TR Fernando) Athula was a widely traveled and cultured man, a superb conversationalist and sophisticated wit. My father Mervyn de Silva and Athula had an easy, natural rapport.? ?
As a hobby in retirement he pressed grapes into wine. He was the son of 1TR Fernando and Annie Fernando of Moratuwa. He leaves behind his sister (my aunt) Chitra as the sole survivor of my mother?s family, his wife Nadja, and two sons by Auntie Monica - my cousins, Parakrama and Naresh.

Assassination plot: PM to discuss with India
	
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe would have a discussion with the Indian authorities on the alleged plot to assassinate President Maithripala Sirisena, a Spokesman from the Prime Minister?s office said yesterday.
He said the Prime Minister had decided to discuss the issue with Indian Defence Authorities after an Indian newspaper carried a news item quoting President Sirisena that Indian intelligence service RAW was plotting to assassinate him.
?The Prime Minister has sought an appointment with the Indian defence authorities despite a schedule for his Indian Visit has already been fixed.
?He has sought the appointment in line with his thinking that he should discuss this serious matter with them,? the official said.

Development Strategies and International Trade Minister Malik Samarawickrama today said the Board of Directors of the Board of Investment (BOI) comprised of highly respected professionals, who functioned with utmost responsibility and Integrity.
Issuing a statement, he said the news reports which cast aspersions on the conduct of the BOI Board of Directors are irresponsible and factually Incorrect.
?I categorically reject these baseless allegations made in those news Items. The Board comprised of honourable people who sought to bring back professionalism into the institution and guide the country's investment facilitation and promotion activities. From all reports I have received, the staff of the institution as well as genuine investors have appreciated their professional conduct. Thanks to the investment policies of the government and the efforts of the BOI, the value of the projects approved in 2018 exceeds US$ 18 Billion. Realized FDI Inflows in 2017 was also a record US$ 1.9 Billion. Misleading media reports would erode Investor sentiment at a time when much progress is being achieved,? Minister Samarawickrama said.

China says its loans only 10% of SL?s foreign debts
	
While reiterating that China was not dragging Sri Lanka into a debt trap, Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Lu Kang said Chinese loans only accounted for around 10% of Sri Lanka's foreign debts by 2017.
Mr. Lu expressed these in response to a question asked at the Ministry?s Regular Press Conference on Wednesday.
When asked about the allegations levelled by the US that China is using "debt diplomacy" to expand its influence worldwide, he said Sri Lanka has been a case repeatedly played up by some foreign media recently.
?But by 2017, Chinese loans only accounted for around 10% of Sri Lanka's foreign debts; China's loans to the Philippines made up only less than 1% of its foreign debts. Sri Lanka's Ambassador to China clearly said that the allegation of the Chinese government dragging his country into "debt traps" is entirely wrong. And recently the Finance Secretary of Pakistan also refuted US remarks that the CPEC has caused Pakistan's debt crisis. I believe these countries have the best say over these issues,? he said.

Dogstar Foundation and how they are fixing Negombo?s street dog population
     	 
  At the Daily Mirror, we believe that climate change is one of the greatest threats that we, as Sri Lankans, will face in the future.  Therefore, we intend to provide our readers with local and international content with the objective to educate and inspire. We would also like to learn from our valued readers about any ongoing initiatives in making Sri Lanka a more sustainable nation.   
 We aim to explore sustainable ways of living that have the most positive impact on not just our natural environment, but also for humans and animals.  
While topics such as global warming, pollution, and inequality are confronting, we believe it's time the media stopped shying away from these issues and became an active participant in finding solutions - and we hope you will join us. 
     
				 		 
	
	
?
Almost everyone who lives or visits Sri Lanka recognizes there is a problem with the street dog population.? Wherever you go, be on the beach, your apartment block or on the streets, there are dogs and puppies everywhere that live constantly with the risk of death and disease.??
It was a fortuitous moment in 2016 when successful British project manager Samantha (Sam) Green visited Sri Lanka for a holiday.? Little did she know that this visit would change the course of her career, as well as her life.? In the grounds of a temple, a litter of puppies had come running up to her, riddled with fleas.? After fetching a flea treatment, a monk approached her and asked if she could help another animal.? He took her to a severely emaciated dog, suffering with mange and a range of sores, her leg bent at an unusual angle. As Sam looked into the eyes of the sick dog, who was later to be named Mango, something changed for her.? She found herself agreeing to help and scoured the local area to find a vet to treat the dog and it was there, in a temple courtyard, the idea for the Dogstar Foundation was born.??
?
If you want more information or would like to get involved with the Dogstar Foundation you can head over to their website on: https://www.dogstarfoundation.com/
?
?
Dogstar Office
Fast forward to 2018 and Dogstar has become a leader in Sri Lanka in the management of the street dog population based on the success they?ve had in Negombo where Sam and her husband Mark now live.? Working in partnership with international organizations Mission Rabies and the World Veterinary Services, as well as Edinburgh University, their main objectives are:
Controlling the street dog population (and pets) through sterilization.?
	Running educational programmes in the community to explain the importance of sterilization and animal care in the fight against animal suffering.
	The mobile skin care programme which treats dogs on the spot for a variety of skin complaints such as mange.
	Eradicating rabies through a partnership with Mission Rabies through an evidence based and sustainable programme that doesn?t require the mass culling of dogs.
According to Sam, their method to implement the programme is all science based, the main benefit of this is that the progress is able to be tracked easily. In Negombo they have broken the entire geographical area down into zones.? Members of their team then go into each area on either foot or via tuk to find out how many dogs are there, what condition they are in, how many are sterilized, their genders and approximate age.? To achieve this surveying, they use mobile phone technology with an app that allows them to record every road and area they search and record the location and details of the dogs in the app. Each dog is given a unique number which follows them throughout their journey with Dogstar. Based on this info they are able to create a map of the dog population and plan out their work projects.?
The great news?? Negombo is now 75% sterilized ? that?s roughly 6600 dogs!
The mobile sterilization clinics are advertised in the weeks leading up to the free surgeries and are available to puppies and dogs over 3 months of age depending on their body condition and weight, but as a rule, the younger the dog, the easier they recover from the surgery.? Information is provided on the benefits of spay/neutering dogs to the community as many people are still wary about the process.? Owners are encouraged to bring their dogs in as well as community feeders ? otherwise the majority of the dogs that come to the clinic are caught in the street with a special net ? the most humane and less stressful process for the dog.? For the surgery, pain relief drugs are used and Sam stresses ?that dogs don?t deserve any less care because they are street dogs. A pedigree dog is no more deserving than a street dog.?
Sam explains, ?If we can start to reduce the number of dogs there are, then the groups doing the rehoming will be able to manage a bit better ? every kennel is full, every sanctuary is full, people have 6 dogs in their backyards. The whole welfare thing is all one journey, if we can prevent the number of dogs, then all the people down the chain will find it easier as well. We have tourists emailing in saying they can?t believe the difference in Negombo with reduction of street dogs and the ones they saw were healthy. There?s more food, resources, less sexually driven fighting, close contact parasites - once you have a stable population we can just let them live their life.?
Dogstar Team:Tamsin, Sam, Mark
?
Can I call Dogstar if I find an injured dog on the road?
As much as they would love to be able to help each and every animal, because of limited funding and resources in the area of emergency medical care, if you come across an animal that has been hurt it?s best to call an organization such as Embark who can guide you on how to help.? ?
?With many other daily challenges, it?s understandable that animal welfare isn?t usually high up on the list of priorities for the majority of people and many have not been given the information on what sort of needs animals have. Sam reflected that ?people are not deliberately cruel to animals, most often they just didn?t know that what they were doing was not the optimum way.? It?s a common belief in Sri Lanka that dumping puppies on the road or at the temple is the best thing to do for them but unfortunately most won?t survive this way. By sterilizing your dog, you avoid the suffering all together.??
Mange treatment
There is major shift happening in Sri Lanka at the moment, especially with the younger generation ? animal welfare is a concern and people are passionate about getting out there to do something to benefit animals, whether it be becoming vegan, fostering street animals until they find forever homes or volunteering with an animal welfare organization.
This highly successful programme that Sam and Mark have created is transferrable and their dream is to have vets in all areas of Sri Lanka running the sterilization programme and getting their own street dog populations under control.??
Happy, safe dogs are a joy to be around and with the help of the communities, there is hope for man?s best friend in Sri Lanka.??
?
The great news?? Negombo?s pooches are now?
75% sterilized ? that?s roughly 6600 dogs!

## Title: Emerging issues in elderly care: Is Sri Lanka prepared?

Emerging issues in elderly care: Is Sri Lanka prepared?
	
Recently I had the opportunity in listen to a lecture on Alzheimer?s disease, a condition causing memory loss. The lecturer was Prof. Christopher Butler, a neurologist from the University of Oxford. He highlighted some of the biggest issues we will face globally with the rapidly expanding elderly population. And problems pertaining to memory loss. Petrified by what he presented, I was keen to study some numerical data on how Sri Lankan elderly population would expand.??
We now have close to 821,000 people aged 75 and above. Which will exceed 1.4 million by 2030. There will be more than 3.5 million people who are more than 65 years of age by then. (Source: US Dept. of Census ? International data base) 65 is the age limit we consider when defining the geriatric population. So as a nation, are we prepared to handle health care and related needs of the elderly?? ?
Imagine the workforce we require to provide the comforts to the geriatric population? One to one care wouldn?t be a possibility at all as Sri Lanka will require 3.5 million caregivers to look after the same number of elderly people. Unlike some of the developed countries we do not have a government sponsored support system to look after the aged persons. Even certain elderly care homes are facing numerous administration problems. I witness the ?dropouts? who did not meet the ?entry criteria? on the streets ? slow diseased and aged men or women begging for survival.??
In Sri Lanka, the extended family concept, which is still preserved in the rural areas might mimic an enriched environment. Sadly the large families that once were, are slowly fragmenting into small units, because of the ?global trends in independent living?
Some of you who are reading my article will be entering the geriatric age group within the next decade. Certain issues that the old aged population will face are cognitive health problems (memory and thinking), mental health conditions (loneliness, depression, suicidal thoughts etc), physical injuries, malnutrition, substance abuse and poor housing. As a country we need to anticipate all these complications.??
Advances in health care is a key reason for longevity. Unlike medieval times all the scientific knowledge is dissipated globally within a matter of a few days thanks to information technology. Some say that access to better health care, the latest trends and knowledge is just a few seconds away because of smart devices. Healthy trendy habits are being promoted by media. In the state sector where I am an employee, we make use of this knowledge to provide the best of evidence based treatment to the elderly.? ?
Nevertheless there are certain controversial arguments on whether prolonging lives of the elderly is worthwhile, as they are the group that contributes the least to the society. And also on the costs involved in advanced health care. Some expostulate that the lifespan shouldn?t be extended through artificial means. As medical professionals what we try to achieve is the minimum amounts of disability so that the aged population can take good care of themselves. Without depending on a caregiver.? ?
We now have close to 821,000 people aged 75 and above
	SL needs 3.5 million caregivers to look after same number of elders
Further talking about elderly care and technology, I saw a video of how Japan is attempting to experiment with robots capable of looking in to the needs of the old. In a developing country using technology to this degree might be too costly. Therefore using the existing ?extended family? concept and ?enriched environment? might be a better solution.? ?
What is an enriched environment? This is a situation where the brain is stimulated through social and physical surroundings. Especially after strokes, an enriched environment is proven to be very effective in bringing back the previous functions/ memory. In Sri Lanka, the extended family concept, which is still preserved in the rural areas might mimic an enriched environment. Sadly the large families that once were, are slowly fragmenting into small units, because of the ?global trends in independent living?.??
Being a rheumatologist/ rehabilitation specialist, I am keen to enhance the quality of life of my geriatric patients. If the elderly are treated in such a way that mobility related pain becomes ignorable, they usually recommence their previous activities. By avoiding falls, a huge cost and a burden to the family is prevented. In the absence of memory loss (dementia) component, some veteran professionals can contribute a lot to the society using their vast experience. I have witnessed volunteer schemes in the UK where starting from hospital reception help desks, most tasks are done by the elderly. The sense of importance gifted to them through these schemes, is important in enhancing self-esteem.??
Sri Lanka has to prepare for the elderly population expansion. Screening for future health needs, correcting all disabilities, promoting self-care and increasing self-esteem of the geriatric population should be our aims
My suggestion is commencing screening programmes exclusively for the elderly in Sri Lanka. This should be a free access facility in all State hospitals. So far we do not have such an established countrywide scheme of screening. One might wonder why we should waste medical resources on such a programme when the hospitals are already overburdened with work. Assessing their health risks years ahead of catastrophic events might save billions of rupees. As falls/ fractures, heart attacks, cancer, blindness, strokes and other related conditions are time consuming and costly to treat.? ?
Unfortunately to this date we do not have a single consultant geriatrician specialized in Sri Lanka to commence such a herculean task. I remember listening to discussions on starting geriatrics as early as my Medical Officer days. Even as I write this article a group of clever specialists are attempting their level best to start this specialty in Sri Lanka. Even if we commence producing several geriatricians this year itself, the rate of production might not meet the enormous demand for geriatricians by the year 2030.?
As a concluding remark, I would like to state that Sri Lanka has to prepare for the elderly population expansion. Screening for future health needs, correcting all disabilities, promoting self-care and increasing self-esteem of the geriatric population should be our aims. So when it comes to elderly care and geriatrics I could say -It?s been a long time coming but better late than never!??

Fish meant for frying came alive
	
An individual who was planning to entertain a few of his friends and treat them to a nice fried fish preparation had gone to a spot where fish caught fresh from a pond was being sold to passers by.?
He did not think twice and quickly purchased 3 fish at the cost of Rs. 400 each for a total of Rs. 1200 from the vendor and made his way back home. Suddenly, he felt a movement in the bag with the fish he was holding and upon inspection that the fish given to him were not dead but alive.
He was now in a quandary as while he was eager to cook these fish for him and his friends, the very thought of killing these poor creatures and having them as a meal suddenly didn't appeal to him any more.
He looked around and seeing a stretch of water that had been created as a result of the heavy rains experienced recently in the area, he released the fish which he had spent so much money to purchase into it and watched the three fish quickly vanish into deeper waters and to safety.
An onlooker who saw this kind deed was overcome with emotion and shed a tear as a result. (Tillakaratna Dissanayaka - Gampaha )

GOVT. in turmoil as prez-PM clash Interim Government with Mahinda Rajapaksa a remote possibility
	
Sri Lankan politics is full of confusions, contradictions and contrasts. The political situation was hotting up even with the possibility of a change of government a week ago. It happened after speculation was rife that President Maithripala Sirisena was contemplating the formation of a new government. The media reports about a secret meeting between President Sirisena and former President Mahinda Rajapaksa at the residence of MP S.B. Dissanayake gave rise to such speculation.? ?
However, political euphoria, generated by it within the opposition, fizzled out last Sunday as the President communicated that he would prefer such a change of government only after the 2019 budget was passed in Parliament.? ?
The President, through his emissaries informed his position to the JO or the MR camp
	After a month-long debate, it will be put to a vote only on December 5, 2018
	The Prime Minister is slated to visit India this weekend and will meet with Premier Modi
The President, through his emissaries such as MPs S.B. Dissanayake and Dilan Perera, informed his position to the JO or the MR camp.? ?
Incensed by the latest position of the President, the MR camp now believes that it was yet another ruse by the President to hoodwink them with the false promise to form an interim government. According to the President, the United National Party (UNP) has the numerical strength in Parliament to defeat even the annual budget of the interim government. As such, the President believes it is not advisable to form such a minority government with MR at this hour. So, he indicated his interest in considering such a proposal only after the budget.? ?
The dates are already fixed for the budget debate. After a month-long debate, it will be put to a vote only on December 5, 2018. Afterwards, everyone will be in holiday mood for the New Year. After the holiday vacation, things will be on track properly only in January, next year.? ?
After weighing pros and cons, on the contrary to what the President appears to be thinking, the MR camp sees that it is not the correct timing to form a government. All in all, the formation of a new interim government now remains a remote possibility with such contrasting thoughts between the President and the former President coupled with skepticism. Also, the JO makes it conditional that the SLFP led by the President should detach itself from the government for any dialogue on the formation of a new government. A formal decision by the SLFP to this effect is also unlikely under the current circumstances.? ?
The President?s meeting MR created rumblings within the UNP last week. Now, the UNP can breathe a sigh of relief because a change of their government is not imminent.? ?
President, PM lash out each other at Cabinet
Be that as it may, animosity between President Sirisena and PM Ranil Wickremesinghe took new heights on Tuesday as the two leaders embroiled themselves in a heated exchange of words at the weekly Cabinet meeting. It started after Ports and Shipping Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe presented a Cabinet memorandum seeking approval to develop the East Container Terminal of Colombo Port by Sri Lanka Ports Development Authority (SLPDA).? ?
The Prime Minister, however, opined that that it should be done under an Indian investment. Development Strategies and International Trade Minister Malik Samarawickrama also stressed the need to hand over the terminal for development to India.??
The suggestion infuriated the President. In an excited mood, the President unleashed his verbal barrage in all directions sparing no one, and even charged that the country would compromise its sovereignty by alienating its seaports to external parties in this manner.? ?
While rapping the government for leasing out of the Hambantota Port to a Chinese company, he said it would spell more doom in the event of alienation of a stake of the Colombo Port to another country in the same way.? ?If we act like this, we will not be able to berth our own ship in our own port,? he said.? ?
The Prime Minister defended his position saying that a bulk of transshipment business at Colombo Port was done with India. He cited it as justification for handing over the East Container Terminal for development to India. But, the President, at this point, referred to his meeting with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the sidelines of Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi Sectoral and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC) summit in Kathmandu, Nepal last month.? ?
?PM Modi does not mind the SLPDA developing it single-handedly,? he said.? ?
It enraged the Prime Minister prompting him to remark in Sinhala, ?Modi agamethithuma dannawanam, ona Bambuwak (Hang it if PM Modi knows it!) The Prime Minister is slated to visit India this weekend and will meet with Premier Modi and discuss the issues at hand. The President did not stop at that. He struck a note of criticism on Chinese involvement in development projects as well. ?I met with Malaysian Prime Minister Dr. Mahathir Mohammad. He asked me to exercise caution in dealing with China,? the President added.? ?
RAW conspires to kill me- President?
In addition, the President spoke out his disillusionment with the lack of progress in investigations into the alleged assassination attempt on him.??
?If I am the person with authority in this case, I will not keep the present Inspector General of Police (IGP) even for a week,? he thundered.? ?
Commenting on the Indian national questioned over the assassination plot, the President called him an agent of India?s Research and Analysis Wing (RAW). In this way, he tried to tell that RAW was conspiring to eliminate him physically.? ?
?I know Indian PM Narendra Modi does not know about it,? he said.? ?
Earlier, the accusation was that RAW played a pivotal role in unseating the MR regime and installing the current President. Today, the President accused the very same RAW of hatching a plot to kill him.? ?
Sirimavo?s foreign policy the best?- Rajitha
Amidst tension between the President and the PM, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne tried to douse the fire. He opined that Sri Lanka, as a small nation, could not dictate terms to big powers. Instead, he said Sri Lanka needed cooperation of all. In this respect, he cited the foreign policy of former Prime Minister, late Sirimavo Bandaranaike as the best model for Sri Lanka.??
?She nicely balanced out relations with China and India,? he said.? ?
Come what may, the President seems to be toeing a national-minded approach which is, in fact, characteristic of his political upbringing with the SLFP. The SLFP has given leadership till recent times to the left-of-centre political forces of this country. In contrast, the UNP is pursuing the liberal economic model.??
The policy contrasts between the UNP and the President are becoming more and more prominent. It has led to indecision in the government on crucial issues. Some of the UNP Ministers doubt whether the President has struck a deal with MR to topple their government. Rising bitterness between the President and the PM has given reasons for them to harbour such thoughts. However, the JO is not that keen to form a government at this hour. Instead, its leaders who met at MR?s Colombo residence and discussed measures to apply pressure on the government to conduct provincial council elections.? ?

It started after Ports and Shipping Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe presented a Cabinet memorandum seeking approval to develop the East Container Terminal of Colombo Port by Sri Lanka Ports Development Authority (SLPDA).
The Prime Minister, however, opined that that it should be done under an Indian investment. Development Strategies and International Trade Minister Malik Samarawickrama also stressed the need to hand over the terminal for development to India.??
The suggestion infuriated the President. In an excited mood, the President unleashed his verbal barrage in all directions sparing no one, and even charged that the country would compromise its sovereignty by alienating its seaports to external parties in this manner.? ?
While rapping the government for leasing out of the Hambantota Port to a Chinese company, he said it would spell more doom in the event of alienation of a stake of the Colombo Port to another country in the same way.? ?If we act like this, we will not be able to berth our own ship in our own port,? he said.? ?
The Prime Minister defended his position saying that a bulk of transshipment business at Colombo Port was done with India. He cited it as justification for handing over the East Container Terminal for development to India. But, the President, at this point, referred to his meeting with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the sidelines of Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi Sectoral and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC) summit in Kathmandu, Nepal last month.? ?
?PM Modi does not mind the SLPDA developing it single-handedly,? he said.? ?
It enraged the Prime Minister prompting him to remark in Sinhala, ?Modi agamethithuma dannawanam, ona Bambuwak (Hang it if PM Modi knows it!) The Prime Minister is slated to visit India this weekend and will meet with Premier Modi and discuss the issues at hand. The President did not stop at that. He struck a note of criticism on Chinese involvement in development projects as well. ?I met with Malaysian Prime Minister Dr. Mahathir Mohammad. He asked me to exercise caution in dealing with China,? the President added.??
RAW conspires to kill me- President?
In addition, the President spoke out his disillusionment with the lack of progress in investigations into the alleged assassination attempt on him.??
?If I am the person with authority in this case, I will not keep the present Inspector General of Police (IGP) even for a week,? he thundered.? ?
Commenting on the Indian national questioned over the assassination plot, the President called him an agent of India?s Research and Analysis Wing (RAW). In this way, he tried to tell that RAW was conspiring to eliminate him physically.? ?
?I know Indian PM Narendra Modi does not know about it,? he said.? ?
Earlier, the accusation was that RAW played a pivotal role in unseating the MR regime and installing the current President. Today, the President accused the very same RAW of hatching a plot to kill him.? ?(Kelum Bandara)

"Ministers who leaked RAW canard must be exposed"
	
Four cabinet Ministers who had told the canard that President Mithripala Sirisena at Tuesday's cabinet meeting had incriminated India's Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) for an attempt on his life, to the Hindu Newspaper Colombo Correspondent Meera Srinuivasan must be exposed and they themselves must come forward and admit the blunder and apologize, Ports and Shipping Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe said today.
?We have no intention to press journalists to reveal their source. But it is quite obvious that certain cabinet ministers have given this false information to the media. The government must go to the bottom of the false propaganda and expose the four Ministers who misled the media, the public and the government. There is no doubt that the false news item has been planted in the media to create a misunderstanding between Colombo and New Delhi and also to harm the centuries old cultural, trade, religious and social links between India and Sri Lanka. That is a thorough inquiry is necessary to find the origin of this fabrication and purpose behind it,? Minister Samarasinghe noted.
?It is better the cabinet Ministers who gave the misleading information to journalists come forward, accept their blunder and apologise because the repercussions of the false news item is extremely serious and affect the cordial links of two neighboring countries,? he added.
He charged that media reports on remarks allegedly made by President Sirisena incriminating the RAW for an attempt to assassinate him was a complete fabrication aimed at creating a division between President Sirisena and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the two countries and added the issue will be fully discussed at the next cabinet meeting.
Minister Samarasinghe said a highly perturbed President Sirisena spoke to Prime Minister Modi and explained to him the true position on Wednesday afternoon and added that New Delhi issued a statement to pacify the situation after that.
On face value of the news item published in 'Hindu' the leading Indian national Newspaper, four ministers had reportedly told Colombo Correspondent of Hindu Meera Sirinivasan that President Sirisena had told the Ministers at the weekly cabinet meeting on Tuesday that there had been an attempt on his life involving the RAW. It was an unfounded and absolute lie, Minister Samarasinghe stressed.
Addressing the weekly SLFP news briefing at the party office yesterday, Minister Samarasinghe said the matter was extremely serious and needed thorough investigation to find out the truth and the motive behind the canard.
President Sirisena was highly upset on these negative developments. He spent the entire day, Wednesday to calm down the situation because the false propaganda involves two neighboring and friendly countries, he noted.
Responding to a journalist on the question whether four Ministers could say the same story, Minister Samarasinghe asked could any one reject the statements issued on this issue explaining the correct position by Indian government, Presidential Secretariat, Cabinet office and Foreign Ministry.
Minister Samarasasinghe said President Sirisena also met the Indian High Commissioner, Taranjit Singh Sandhu and explained to him the correct situation. (Sandun A Jayasekera)

No new proposal to handover ECT Development to India
	
No new Cabinet proposal had been submitted by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe or any minister to handover the Colombo Port?s East Container Terminal (ECT) development to India, the Daily Mirror learns.
Reports earlier said President Maithripala Sirisena and the Prime Minister had a showdown at the Tuesday?s Cabinet meeting as the President was opposed to a proposal made to handover ECT Development to India.
Highly placed sources at the Government yesterday rejected the reports and said that Ports and Shipping Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe had submitted a fresh proposal to Cabinet on Tuesday to develop the ECT only by the Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA), rescinding a proposal previously approved by the Cabinet in 2017 to develop the ECT under a Public-Private Partnership (PPP).
Following the Cabinet approval in 2017, deliberations at the highest levels of Governments of India, Japan and Sri Lanka had taken place on the ECT development. An MoU had been signed between Sri Lanka and India to develop the ECT as a joint venture in April last year following the Cabinet approval.
After taking into consideration the already signed MoU and granted Cabinet approval, the Prime Minister has requested the Cabinet to defer the proposal in view of his upcoming visit to India.
He had said that it is unwise to revoke an MoU unilaterally. Therefore, had requested time to take up the issue with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and come to an agreement during his Indian visit which commences today (18).
Subsequently, the Cabinet of Ministers had agreed to postpone the new proposal for two weeks.
The source said Development Strategies and Internal Trade Ministry, which had submitted observations over the new proposal, had said that the government to government deliberations held between Sri Lanka, Japan and India should be considered when developing the ECT.
?In the circumstances, it is considered important to consider the decision on ECT development in the light of the discussions held at the highest level, while ensuring a commercially viable development model,? Ministry said.
The ECT development had been planned to take place in three stages; the first stage with Indian assistance, second stage with Japanese assistance and the third stage by Sri Lanka.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe had highlighted at the Cabinet meeting that 80 percent of transshipments handling at the Colombo Port was from India and therefore, it would affect Sri Lanka if the signed MoU was rescinded. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Notes for a Manifesto: National Interest should frame Foreign Policy
	
The previous regime is supposed to have had a disastrous foreign policy which made for terrible foreign relations. That was what the detractors of that regime told us. Today they are in power and their detractors say the same thing: ?This government?s foreign policy, like most things, is an unmitigated disaster and this is evidenced by the abysmal state of foreign relations.? ?
To get a hang of it all, a simple question would suffice: How does one measure the worth of foreign policy?
The short answer is, ?healthy foreign relations?. That however can be misleading for foreign affairs is a lot of about saying nice things, smiling for the camera and still getting the short end of the stick. It depends often on who is making the claim, about who is giving medical certificates, so to speak.? ?
A representative of a ?friendly? country can say that it has excellent relations with another country because that other country serves the interests of the first or at least does not subvert interests in any way.? So too can a sycophantic leadership of a particular country praise the ?master-nation? and wax eloquent about relations between the two. We?ve seen that a lot before and after Independence, the most recent being Mangala Samaraweera in his ?external affairs? avatar and probably with a nod from his political master(s) co-sponsoring a patently anti-Sri Lanka resolution in the UNHRC. The US and its allies hailed it and their local cheering squad duly cheered.? ?
There are two things that need to be studied and understood before we embark on designing foreign policy. First, we do not live in a flat world. There are powerful nations and blocs of nations; there are weak nations. This is in terms of wealth and military might.? ?
The powerful have ways of arm-twisting the weak and forcing representatives of nations so subdued to hail subjugation as victory. The work of and processes within multilateral agencies are marked by this reality. This is why one need not get excited when representatives of powerful nations talk about ?friendship?. That is one of the most abused words in the lexicon of diplomacy. The only difference is that these days they don?t use the term ?White man?s burden?. They force you to submit to their will and nudge you to say ?Yaaaay!? That?s if you haven?t said it already!? ?
Given this reality, what we are really talking about when it comes to bilateral or multilateral relations and agreements is the negotiation of the terms of subjugation. This brings us to the second element that has to frame foreign policy: National interest.? ?
It?s an easy term and one that is easily abused. Self-interest, say that of incumbent political leaders or coalitions, can be called ?national interest? and since those in power have the inside track on the communications apparatus such subterfuge can easily be marketed (which is why vigilance and voice are important elements of political engagement and which is why, typically, those so inclined are purchased or silenced). What the nation?s interest, ideally, should be figured out through long and informed dialogue, and moreover should be seen as something that is dynamic, ever-changing and yet amenable to broad definition where core and relatively more robust elements are identified.? ?
If there is no notion of what the national interest is or if leaders are lazy, ignorant or flippant about the nation?s interests, they are easy prey to the manipulations that abound in international forums.??
There are two things that need to be studied and understood before we embark on designing foreign policy. First, we do not live in a flat world. There are powerful nations and blocs of nations; there are weak nations. This is in terms of wealth and military might
Importantly, a nation can and should have multiple interests. Some of them may of course be privileged at specific times and under specific conditions, but it has to be understood that all of them are in the picture, always. There are different ways of defining different interest, this has to be understood as well. Security, for some, could be a military matter whereas for others it could include food security, a secure livelihood, a healthy environment etc. For still others, it would resonate with territorial integrity, sovereignty and true and wholesome citizenship. Apart from all this, as mentioned, the multiplicity has to be taken into account and the entire gamut taken as a matrix. Therefore policy designers will have to contend with prioritizing, giving more weight to certain elements over others and always factoring the ?long term?.? ?
A simple example will illustrate. Some might say, as Dr Harsha De Silva has, that it is prudent to frame foreign policy in terms of economic imperatives. However, economic imperatives, just like ?development? are not givens, but are value-laden and not politically innocent. Dr De Silva?s ?imperatives? are essentially neoclassical and are therefore attended with all manner of fallacies. ?Growth-led? stuff, to give another example, may have little room to accommodate environmental concerns. Out goes the future, right there.? ?
National security can dominate the equation, at times. So too a frail economy or a failed/failing state (of affairs), or even a floundering government. Inept, corrupt, dictatorial and/or treacherous leaders could conflate political survival with national interest. They could run to their preferred big brother in the international community, plead their case, genuflect if necessary and obtain relief. Foreign policy can be framed in that way too. They can play Brown Sahib. They can be pawns.? ?
In the end, for as long as we remain deficient in some way, we open ourselves to machinations. If we know what the nation?s interests are and have the wisdom to anticipate the interests of generations to come, then we can negotiate more effectively, we can contest the beautifully worded but nevertheless pernicious terms and conditions of bilateral friendship.??
A candidate or a party aspiring to rule this country, for all these reasons, must first and foremost describe and detail ?The National Interest? and make that definition open to constant debate. Without clarity on this, there cannot be clarity in foreign policy and moreover leaders will be handicapped when negotiation takes place on all bilateral and multilateral issues.??
Over to you, Messers Nagananda Kodituwakku, Rohan Pallewatte, Gotabaya Rajapaksa, Patali Champika Ranawaka, Ranil Wickremesinghe, Maithripala Sirisena and any other individual entertaining hopes of becoming the next President of Sri Lanka.??

The gym consists of several metal climbing frames, gymnastic beams and parallel bars, ideal for bodyweight resistance exercises like calisthenics. Because the East London gym was literally built from the weapons of those involved in gang crime, it creates a dialogue in the community about violent gang culture and hopefully gives young people an outlet for their energy rather than getting involved in antisocial behaviour.?

?Rabindranath Tagore Memorial Auditorium? at University of Ruhuna
	
People and Govt. of India make Prof. Gamini Senanayake?s dream a reality
The People and the Government of India saw Senior Professor Gamini Senanayake realize his dream of building an auditorium in memory of Rabindranath Tagore when Indian High Commissioner to Sri Lanka, Taranjith Singh Sandhu dedicated the state-of-the-art ?Rabindranath Tagore Memorial Auditorium? at the University of Ruhuna on October 9.? ?
The Vice Chancellor of the University of Ruhuna speaking at the event recalled that it was in 2011 when he was the Deputy Vice Chancellor that he had mentioned to the Indian High Commissioner at the time of his dream of building an auditorium in memory of the great Indian author Rabindranath Tagore for the University of Ruhuna. The High Commissioner had asked him to submit a proposal for it as soon as possible. He said that he had worked through the night and with the help of the University?s works engineer he had been able to submit the proposal to the Indian High Commission. Though the Indian government agreed to the fund the project, the Sri Lankan government raised objections and refused to approve it saying that the proposal had not been channeled through the Department of External Resources.? ?
But only when the Indian Government indicated that Premier Narendra Modi in 2015 said he would be looking forward to sign the MOU when he would visit Sri Lanka. ?The MOU was signed in the presence of the two leaders of the country at a ceremony to which I was not even invited,? said Prof. Senanayake.
?Nevertheless I am extremely grateful to the people and the government of India for making my dream a reality? he added.? ?
The foundation stone for the state of the art auditorium with seating capacity for 1500 was laid by the former Indian High Commissioner Y. K. Sinha on July 21, 2016. The Indian Government has granted Rs. 265 million. Construction of the auditorium was done by Link Engineering (Pvt) Ltd while the State Engineering Corporation of Sri Lanka were the consultants of the project. The consultation fees and all taxes were borne by the Government of Sri Lanka.? ?
Welcoming the distinguished guests on behalf of the University of Ruhuna, Deputy Vice Chancellor Prof. Nayana Alagiyawanna thanked Prof. Gamini Senanayake for devoting his valuable time and energy to obtain the state of the art auditorium and thanked the government of India for providing the funds.? ?
Indian High Commissioner Taranjith Singh Sandhu said that Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore was an intellectual and a giant among men whose contribution to arts, music, education and literature was unparalleled and he was the first non-European to win the Nobel Prize for Literature. ?The auditorium has been built conforming to the designs of Sri Lanka?s most famous architect Geoffrey Bawa as we have always believed in delivering as per your choices and priorities?? ?
Quoting Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the High Commissioner said ?We should remain students for life a time and we should yearn to learn from every moment in life? He also said that? Universities are not mere lecture theatres but meeting places of minds where new ideas are born and where all boundaries that differentiate one man from the other are transcended.? ?
He urged the students of the University of Ruhuna to connect with the youth of India and take advantage of the scientific and educational development in India.? India of today is very different from yesteryear?. He said that India has the third largest scientific and technical manpower in the world and that India?s internet user base is the second largest in the world and leads the world in mobile data consumption. The government of India offers 750 scholarships to Sri? ?Lankan students for undergraduate, postgraduate and doctorate study.? ?
The High Commissioner reiterated that India remained committed to walking with Sri Lanka in the journey towards development and was always ready to extend offer India?s expertise and skill sets.?
?We believe in making real difference to the lives of people. The dance troupes from the Faculty of Medicine and the Faculty of Fisheries and Marine Science and Technology were honored to be the first to perform at the new auditorium?, the Indian High Commissioner said.

?We have followed a proper and legal procedure in the removal of former Chief Justice Bandaranayake. Nobody can say that what we had done was illegal.

SLFP Gen. Secy takes on Rajitha
	
The cabinet spokesman saying ?will be hanged?, ?should be hanged,? ?everyone will be put in jail? at a press conference will give rise to serious questions in the minds of the people about the Executive, the Legislative and the Judiciary in a country like ours that is still evolving a mature political culture, SLFP General Secretary Professor Rohana Lakshman Piyadasa said yesterday.
He was referring to Cabinet Spokesman Rajitha Seneratne who said ?will be hanged,? ?should be hanged? and ?everyone will be put in jail? at the weekly cabinet press briefing on Wednesday.
?I did not see him say it. I did not watch news. But if Minister Rajitha Senaratne spoke like that ? it is not suitable for him to speak in an emotional manner before journalists,?? Prof. Piyadasa said in Kandy.
?My opinion is that the Cabinet spokesman should not get angry or emotional. He should engage with the journalists in an intelligent manner with facts,? he said.
?The President is implementing very advanced concepts to protect the independence of the judiciary. As an example it was after 30 years that a Chief Justice was appointed according to experience and seniority. At such a time if a minister says ?will be hanged,? ?all will be put in jail? ? it will create a notion among the people whether a freedom of the wild ass is being created in the country again,? he said.
?During the recent past our Executive, the Legislative and the Judiciary were going astray. The confidence of the public was shattered in them. Are we going back to such a time, is what would arise in the mind of the public,? he said.? ?
?What I can say as the General Secretary of a responsible political party is that such statements could harm the President?s difficult effort to restore our shattered political culture. The judiciary is being restored again. There was a time when houses of the judges of the Supreme Court were stoned.
Persons were brought from the outside and appointed as Chief Justices. Now the judiciary is enjoying some freedom and independence.? It should be enhanced further,? he said. (J.A.L. Jayasinghe)

Today (18) is Saraswathi Pooja; Vijayadasami tomorrow (19) The importance of Navarathri in today?s c
	
What connects Robert Oppenheimer of the Manhattan Project, the oil slick Middle, East, and Navarathri?
The Hindu Pantheon has innumerable Gods- 33 million or so to be more precise. Navarathri which is celebrated (nine plus one) for ten days celebrates three important Goddesses. Among them, namely Durga, Lakshmi and Saraswathi the patron Goddesses of metaphorical courage, wealth and wisdom or education, however, wisdom is more associated with Ganesh.
A pan-Indian Hindu celebration, the ten-day observance falls in October-November based on the Hindu calendar. The days may vary according to? different schools of Panchankam (Calendar).
At the end of the nine days of evening poojas, to Goddesses Durga, Lakshmi and Saraswati, the tenth day called Vijayadasami is again attributed to Godess Durga. It is the most auspicious festival during Dakshinaayana or the southern motion of the sun. Vijaya is victory. It is the day that Durga defeated the Asura Mahisha (Mahisasura) after nine days of battle.
Durga meaning ?the inaccessible? or ?the invincible?, is the most popular incarnation of Mother Goddess and one of the main forms of the Goddess Shakti in the Hindu pantheon. Durga is the original manifested form of Mother Parvati or Adi-Parashakti. Durga is Adi-Parashakti herself. The Devi Gita, declares her to be the greatest Goddess. According to the Skanda Purana, the goddess Parvati accounted for the name ?Durga? after she killed the demon Mahishasura.
It metaphorically means victory over evil. The puranic tradition has it that Durga vanquished several other the asuras as well during the course of the battle? Mahisha (The Asura with Buffalo Head, Chanda-Munda, and Shumbha- Nisumbha. The tenth day is also called Vijaya Kaal ? the most auspicious time to begin the journey to accomplish one?s aims.
As Ananda Kentish Kumaraswamy observed Hinduism is layered with complex symbolism and metaphors. If one analyses, he/she can see that the nine-day Saraswathi Pooja, in fact, poses the primordial and universal questions on the existence of life and intelligence.
As many would know Durga is the Patron Goddess for Courage; Lakshmi for Wealth and, Saraswathi, always depicted with a string instrument of Veena (Symbol of skill, education and particularly the Vedas) is the Patron Goddess of education. Each aspect of the important aspects of life is celebrated for three days totalling nine respectively.
Many Hindus across the world celebrate the nine holy days in various ways depending on their beliefs.
Setting it up of ?Golu? is in just one of them. The Golu is a representation of society, where all kinds of dolls are placed.? The top row portrays images of Gods while the bottom row exhibits inanimate and lowly beings thus reflecting the social pyramid.
Since associated with Saraswathi, the Goddess of learning Vidyarambam (Auspicious time start education) or introducing a child to letters and starting to learn a new skill is also done during these days, on the last day of the three-day Saraswathi Poojas, which is the ninth day (Today).
The question then is which is more fundamental to human existence. However, it seems that the ancient Hindu wisdom has tacitly answered the question by placing Durga as the first and the last in the ten-day observance, metaphorically courage defending both-wealth and knowledge
The nine-day observance poses basic and universal and never ending debate ?which is important to life: Courage, Wealth or Learning.
The question then is which is more fundamental to human existence. However, it seems that the ancient Hindu wisdom has tacitly answered the question by placing Durga as the first and the last in the ten-day observance, metaphorically courage defending both-wealth and knowledge.
This poses the question ?Why courage??
The debate is generally considered neverending. But courage in its broader sense seems to be the basis for everything, including wealth and education and/or knowledge. Knowledge is also wealth.
Many authors in Tamil- all Hindu, Buddhist and Jain- have dealt with these issues. One has to keep in mind that almost all of these writings had been didactic works. For example, the Nannool is a work on Tamil Grammar written by a Jain ascetic Bavananthi Munivar around 13th Century AD.? One may wonder what a book on grammar has to do with Saraswathi Pooja. A logical question indeed.
A stanza in its First Chapter, on to whom a teacher should not impart his knowledge, Bavananthi Munivar was clear that a teacher shall not take someone, who is afraid of books/education or course of study, as student.
Hence, clearly, to study or to engage in any worldly activity, courage is the basis.
Even to create wealth, even if one has the know-how, to embark on a career of business and wealth, courage is needed.
The ?courage? discussed here should not be confused with gun-toting or sword-wielding courage. It is the concept of courage. One needs the courage to face life in society. It was, it is and it ever will be to anyone in all spheres of life. It also forms the basis, even for the evolutionary process.??
One may possess an important piece of knowledge, but if he/she lacked the courage to put it into proper use or prevent improper use- it is useless.
Robert Oppenheimer comes in view. He was the American theoretical physicist and is among those who are credited with being the ?father of the atomic bomb?.? In the same vein if he/she can?t protect it from wrong hands in can pose a threat to all. Knowledge in the wrong hands is dangerous. So, is wealth. Countries with the wealth of resources should have the courage and the military to protect their wealth. And Iran has all right to have nukes. Makes sense. Or go the way Libya, Iraq and Syria did. If one had wealth, then it goes without saying that he/she should be able to protect it.? One should understand the fundamentals. Hope many will hereafter.

Twists  and turns in W.M. Mendis & Company investigation
	
The investigation conducted by the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) into the controversial Treasury bond saga has now taken a new twist after three employees of W.M. Mendis and Company and their attorney-at-law alleged that the CID and senior officers of the Attorney General?s Department of fabricated witness statements and intimidated witnesses.??
W.M. Mendis is not directly a suspect company in the bond investigation, but the company became engulfed in this investigation due to its ownership interest held by bond suspect Arjun Aloysius, and due to the company?s alleged involvement in several complex financial transactions involving suspect company Perpetual Treasuries. The allegation against W.M. Mendis was that the funds unlawfully earned by Perpetual Treasuries have been transferred to them and was used for unlawful activities such as making payments to leading politicians for favours in return. In July 2018, the CID informed the Colombo Fort Magistrates Court of a statement by a witness alleging that a Rs. 5 million cash payment was made by W.M. Mendis to Brian Sinnaiah, who was a Chief Financial Officer of a company owned by former minister Ravi Karunanayake.?
According to the affidavit, the ASG had challenged Perera to reveal the identities of the individuals identified
	The lawyers appearing for the three witnesses on September 27 told the Fort Magistrate Court the CID had filed a ?B? report with substantial inaccuracies misleading the court
	This alleged conduct by the CID officers can be a charge of serious penal code offences including fabricating evidence to obtain a wrongful conviction
	W.M. Mendis had so far cooperated with the investigators and complied with all court orders served on them where the Hon. Magistrate too had?hailed them
	ASG Kodagoda supervises all major CID investigations including the assassination of the the Editor-in-Chief of The Sunday Leader Lasantha Wickrematunge and Keith Noyahr abduction
This transaction and others emerged after the CID took a fine-tooth comb to the finances of Perpetual Treasuries, W.M. Mendis and other associated companies, in an attempt to discern the ultimate destination of the funds the State charges were illegally obtained through the 2015 Treasury bond scandal.?
In order to better understand several financial transactions the CID has deemed suspicious, including the payment purportedly involving Brian Sinnaiah, detectives have sought to inspect the accounts and payment vouchers of W.M. Mendis, but found that vouchers for several payments, including the one concerning the Rs. 5 million Sinniah payment, have gone missing.?
SSC Girihagama has a reputation as a ferocious prosecutor who recently defended the arrest of a former army chief of staff and director of military intelligence
In January 2018, the report issued by the Commission of Inquiry into the Issuance of Treasury Bonds charged that several officers of Perpetual Treasuries had taken steps to destroy evidence pertaining to the bond issue including voice recordings. It was in this regard that the CID had summoned four senior employees of W.M. Mendis to be questioned on several earlier occasions and on Friday, 31 August 2018.?
The four officials so summoned were Head of Information Communication Technology (ICT) Isuru Jayakody, Assistant ICT Manager Randal Senathunga, Audit Officer Hemantha Kumara and Finance Manager Sujith Alwis. On this occasion, according to documents filed in the Colombo Fort Magistrates Court by both the CID and attorneys for W.M. Mendis, all four witnesses had signed statements in which they had confessed to having met in their office late one night in November 2017 and participated in the fabrication and destruction of vouchers that they believed may later be sought by investigators.?
Instructed to lie?
All four statements of the witnesses had further charged that attorney-at-law Chandana Perera had met the foursome at the neighboring Grand Oriental Hotel (GOH) prior to their proceeding to the CID, and had instructed them all to lie to the CID by suppressing any mention of the alleged November 2017 evidence destruction incident. Three of these witnesses, Jayakody, Senathunga and Kumara, now allege that these statements were false and extracted from them coercively by CID officers by means including threats, intimidation and deprivation of food and water. For his part, Attorney Perera has denied the allegation of wrongdoing on his part, both in a sworn affidavit dated September 15, 2018, and in a written complaint sent to the police on September 23, 2018.
In a complaint to the police dated September 23, 2018, Chandana Perera has stated that after the August 31 statements had been recorded at the CID, he personally escorted Jayakody and Senathunga out of the CID around 9 pm, at which time they had informed him that they had been kept at the CID for nearly 12 hours without a proper break or refreshments throughout the day and that later in the night they were forced to make statements contradicting the first and implicating themselves.
The complaint further states that this alleged conduct by the CID officers can be charged as a serious penal code offence including fabricating evidence to obtain a wrongful conviction, using evidence known to be false, and framing a false charge against an innocent with intent to cause injury to that person.?
Over the next several days, CID officers had taken steps to investigate the the said meeting that they were told about by the four W.M. Mendis employees and had taken place on August 31st, in an attempt to corroborate the allegation levelled against Attorney Perera in the four contested statements. The CID meanwhile have obtained CCTV footage from the Grand Oriental Hotel (GOH) showing all the individuals entering, dining in and then leaving the hotel. They have also retrieved the bill for their breakfast and recorded statements from hotel employees.?
Meanwhile the whole episode took a twist on September 12, 2018. Chandana Perera had just concluded an appearance in the High Court when he checked his mobile phone and noticed several missed calls from a State Counsel, known to him, and was appearing in the Treasury Bond investigation involving W.M. Mendis. When Perera returned the call to the state counsel, he was told that the calls had been placed on behalf of Additional Solicitor General (ASG) Yasantha Kodagoda P.C., according to Perera?s sworn affidavit.
The affidavit further states that ASG Kodagoda had asked Perera to come to his chambers at the AG?s Department. Perera had agreed to meet the ASG at 4:30 pm, and had immediately informed his senior counsel Kolitha Dharmawardena of the impending meeting, as he knew that the reason why he was summoned by the ASG involved their client W.M. Mendis, according to the affidavit.
While sitting in the waiting area of ASG Kodagoda?s chamber, Perera had noticed officers of the AG?s Department, who are involved in the bond investigation, coming into the ASG chamber
While sitting in the waiting area of ASG Kodagoda?s chamber, Perera had noticed officers of the AG?s Department, who are involved in the bond investigation, coming into the ASG chamber, including Deputy Solicitor General (DSG) Haripriya Jayasundera and Senior State Counsel Lakmini Girihagama. As DSG Jayasundera entered the chamber, she has inserted a USB pen drive into ASG Kodagoda?s computer. Once the officers had all assembled, the ASG had asked him (Perera) to come and sit across him at his desk. Then, ASG Kodagoda had turned his computer monitor towards him and had showed him video footage of him entering the GOH.
He recalls ASG Kodagoda then saying that ?they?, presumably the AG?s Department, know everything about his meeting with the four witnesses. Perera had confirmed that he met the four clients of W.M. Mendis, for a privileged legal consultation prior to their appearing at the CID. He further asserted that W.M. Mendis had so far cooperated with the investigators and complied with all court orders served on them where the Hon. Magistrate too had hailed them.
ASG Kodagoda?s response, says Perera?s sworn statement, was to accuse him of having committed a serious offence punishable with imprisonment by instructing the persons who have been noticed to appear at the CID to suppress material and make false statements, followed by an observation that Perera may be able to obtain bail, but would be sure to lose his ?black coat?, a reference to his ability to practice law. Perera says DSG Jayasundera echoed these sentiments, before ASG Kodagoda offered him a way out.
Perera challenged?
According to the affidavit, the ASG had challenged Perera to reveal the identities of the individuals identified by initials. Thereafter, ASG Kodagoda has accused that W.M. Mendis had kept copies of the vouchers that had been destroyed and offered not to press criminal charges against him (Perera) if he could contact his client and have them surrendered.
Perera, had insisted that he had no knowledge of any such set of vouchers, and denied any wrongdoing on his part emphasising that he had only given legal, privileged legal advice to his clients.?
According to the affidavit, DSG Jayasundera had said that all four W.M. Mendis employees who had met him at the GOH and later gave statements to the CID had alleged him of wrongdoing in their statements.
The affidavit further states how DSG Jayasundera and ASG Kodagoda, issued an ultimatum to Perera claiming that unless he produces the mystery vouchers before 1:30 pm the following day, 13 September, they would file charges against him. According to what Perera has stated, the meeting concluded with him facing a choice between wrongfully implicating his client and fabricating evidence or seeing his legal career and possibly his liberty jeopardized.?
When this was brought to the notice of his Senior Counsel Kolitha Dharmawardena, the matter has been brought to the notice of Anil Silva PC, who appears for Perpetual Treasuries in the magisterial inquiry. As both of them represent W.M. Mendis and Perpetual Treasuries respectively in the bond investigation, Upul Jaysuriya PC was asked to bring the alleged incident to the notice of Attorney General Jayantha Jayasuriya PC. When this was informed to the AG, he had spoken to ASG who had confirmed his meeting with Perera the previous day.?
ASG Kodagoda supervises all major CID investigations including the assassination of the the Editor-in-Chief of The Sunday Leader newspaper Lasantha Wickrematunge, Prageeth Eknaligoda the disappearance and Keith Noyahr abduction, which have all seen arrests of military intelligence officers and heavy scrutiny of senior defence and military officials of the former regime. He also played a key role in bringing charges against businessman Tiran Alles for the alleged misappropriation of Government housing funds.
SSC Girihagama has a reputation as a ferocious prosecutor who recently defended the arrest of a former army Chief of Staff and Director of Military Intelligence in connection with the Keith Noyahr white van abduction inquiry in the Mount Lavinia Magistrates Court.?
It is said that the main issue with the allegations against the CID and AG?s Department is the long delay between the alleged occurrence of the events, and any public complaint being made.?
Although the gravity of the conduct by the CID that Attorney Perera refers to in his statement what he came to know on August 31 and the alleged intimidation he experienced on September 12 at the AG?s Department, questions have been raised as to why the allegation of improper conduct by the AG?s Department and the CID wasn?t brought to the notice of the police, the magistrate court, the AG or the Head of CID soon after the respective incidents occurred.
When the CID filed their B Report on September 13 in the Fort Magistrates Court, no complaint or public statement regarding the alleged illegal conduct of the CID or the AG?s Department had been informed to the court.? ?No such complaint was made by attorneys appearing for W.M. Mendis even on the occasion of this court hearing, which took place almost two weeks after the highly unethical and possibly criminal conduct of the CID officers are accused of and even what occurred at the AG?s Department on the previous day,? once of the sources said.?
The B Report filed by the CID on September 13 carried a summary of statements recorded, which detailed the allegations contained in the contested CID statements given by the four witnesses of W.M. Mendis on August 31st. The report specifically stated that all four individuals had confessed to their role in destroying evidence, and had further alleged that the witnesses had accused Attorney Chandana Perera of having instructed them to lie to the CID.?
The Commission of Inquiry into the Issuance of Treasury Bonds charged that several officers of Perpetual Treasuries had taken steps to destroy evidence pertaining to the bond issue
All four of these witnesses had signed statements in which they had confessed to having met in their office late one night in November 2017
The allegation against W.M. Mendis was that the funds unlawfully earned by Perpetual Treasuries have been transferred to them
The first documented date for the allegations brought by Perera against the CID and AG?s Department was on September 15th, the date on which Perera?s affidavit was sworn. This too, was only sent in the form of a complaint to the AG on September 17. It was over a week thereafter, when the first complaint to the police was made and only on September 27 that attorneys for W.M. Mendis brought the allegations to the attention of Colombo Fort Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne in open court.
What the lawyers?have to say
But however, lawyers appearing for the witnesses of W.M. Mendis and Chandana Perera said that the reason why it took time to lodge complaints was that they had to follow certain steps after Senior Counsel Kolitha Dharmawardhana sent the written complaint to the AG on Monday, September 17. ?On Sunday, September 23, the complaint was lodged at the CID. We did not want to draft the affidavits in a hurry but record every detail what happened at the AG?s Department and at the CID,? the lawyers said.??
Meanwhile, through a motion, the lawyers appearing for the three witnesses on September 27, told the Fort Magistrate Court the CID had filed a ?B? report with substantial inaccuracies misleading the court. The alleged incident at the AG?s Department on September 12 was also brought to the notice of the court. In the oral submission, the defence lawyers alleged several CID officers of harassing, insulting and intimidating and coercing them to make statements that were not true and to sign these statements.?
The Magistrate thereafter inquired about it from ASG Kodagoda who was present in court. The senior prosecutor responded that because the thrust of the allegations were in the form of written submissions, that the AG?s Department would study those before responding in writing on the next court date, on October 11.
When the case was taken up on October 11, ASG Kodagoda submitted a report in a sealed envelope which contained the observations of the AG in regard to the allegations levelled against two of their senior officials, claiming that it is up to the Magistrate to decide whether the AG?s observation could be made public or not. Since the defense lawyers objected, the Magistrate returned the sealed envelope back to the ASG till she looks into the legal aspect whether the court could accept such a confidential document or not.? ??
When contacted Attorney General Jayantha Jayasuriya PC to know whether he was informed of the alleged incident, the AG said that he cannot make any comment. ?I don?t want to discuss the matter with the media. I will take appropriate action in this regard,? the AG said.
Meanwhile, President of Bar Association of Sri Lanka U.R. de Silva when asked about the matter, said that being conscious of sub judice the BASL would would observe the response of the Attorney General?s Department ?When the matter was taken up, the ASG wanted time to answer the questions that have been raised. Hence we are waiting for the outcome of the next date?s proceedings,? BASL President said.??
All attempts taken to contact Police Spokesman Ruwan Gunasekera, to find out what action the Police has taken, failed. Although a message was left with his officials, there was no response until the paper went for publication. More is expected to unfold at the next court hearing scheduled for October 25.?

War ?heroes? and failed administrators
	
Just nine years after the civil war, Sri Lanka is struggling to stabilize its economy and keep the minority?Tamils happy. 
The economy and minority Tamils are the key issues that the islanders have to address if they need to prosper and make this country a ?real? paradise. Of the two, the latter being resolved could happen sooner if genuine efforts are made by the Government to understand the psyche of this minority community and grant some of their demands, if not all.? ?
But progress in most fronts has stopped largely due to a lack of leadership within the Government and the Tamil community. The Government comprising majority Sinhalese and minority Tamils at one time saw their lives being shaped by two individuals: Mahinda Rajapaksa, the country?s former president, and Veluppillai Prabakaran, the Terrorist leader who carried on a brutal campaign for autonomy. Both Rajapaksa and Prabakaran were dictators and ruthless to no end, but their leadership skills were up to the mark. They could move the people to agree or undertake a task: Rajapaksa through wit and shrewdness and Prabakaran through sheer brutality. Just almost a decade after the war the people of these two communities have much to speak about these two leaders despite the country being in turmoil.? ?
With Prabakaran dead and Rajapaksa having finished two terms as president of Sri Lanka, we see the next set of leaders struggling to get their focus right
	We need leaders with the mentality for development and reconciliation
	Minister of Plantation Industries Navin Dissanayake said recently that the party needs to read the pulse of the people
	UNP?s Navin Dissanayake is much talked about as a future leader of the country and so is Sajith Premadasa. The latter has shown traits of his father in terms of pursuing a task
With Prabakaran dead and Rajapaksa having finished two terms as president of Sri Lanka, we see the next set of leaders struggling to get their focus right in taking their respective communities and the country forward.? ?
We are not experiencing a war now. We need leaders with the mentality for development and reconciliation. In this respect present President Maithripala Sirisena is the best bet and is on the hot seat. But many feel that the thoughts of politicians must be supported by actions. This Sirisena can only perform to a certain extent because the party (UNP) that backed him doesn?t prefer him unlike before. This wasn?t the case with Rajapaksa. There were quite a few who didn?t like him, but chose to work for him during his tenure. The present president is a good example. Even if you removed the President?s garb from Rajapaksa, there still would be a leader, waiting to perform, within this man. What stood in good stead for the former president was his far-thinking ability, charisma and being ruthless when he had to.? ?
Now the Rajapaksa and Prabakaran chapters are over. Minister of Plantation Industries Navin Dissanayake said recently that the party needs to read the pulse of the people. He also cautioned the UNP about rifts between party stalwarts and reminisced the differences between his father and former President Ranasinghe Premadasa. A rift similar to this exists between Premier Wickremesinghe and Sajith Premadasa. The civil war taught this country how its citizens should stand by its leaders. But strangely, at times of peace, there are rifts within rifts and a severe shortage of leaders who can double up as administrators.? ?
The SLFP, which Rajapaksa marshalled, is on a rapid decline. The LTTE, which gave somewhat of a voice to the Tamil cause, is no more. New forces have emerged in the political front, but the old lessons learned from the SLFP (Which led the UPFA at elections) and the Tiger rebels mustn?t be forgotten.? ?
A Tamil politician we can learn much from is V. Anandasangaree of TULF fame. There was much criticism aimed at the TULF because it politically accepted the overall dominance by the LTTE. TULF?s Anandasangaree later joined the TNA, but received shabby treatment. He is a mild man, but will fiercely push his point across that non-violence is the way to solve struggles between these two communities. It didn?t come as a surprise when UNESCO awarded him with the Madanjeet Singh Prize for promoting tolerance and non-violence. The Tamil politician is one who wrote to Prabakaran and requested him to give up the arms struggle. Later he resisted the LTTE and and even refused to be intimidated by them. Veteran columnist DBS Jeyaraj once wrote that the years during which Anandasangaree resisted the LTTE were the most productive period during his political career. Still, despite all this, Anandasangaree?s role in active politics came to an end many years ago.? ?
In the new face of Sri Lankan politics we see the emergence of former Defence Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa who is? promoting himself as a possible presidential candidate. Politicians like Gotabaya must have strong opposition because of their dictatorial ways. UNP?s Navin Dissanayake is much talked about as a future leader of the country and so is Sajith Premadasa. The latter has shown traits of his father in terms of pursuing a task and also reading the pulse of the people.? ?
The country?s civil war produced leaders and also gave us headaches. Leaders born during a struggle or conflict don?t fit into any other era. Mahinda Rajapaksa, Prabakaran, our very own former Army Commander Sarath Fonseka and not forgetting former Navy Commander Wasantha Karannagoda played their roles meticulously. But sadly they were shadows of their former selves when they were pushed into administrative roles after the war.? ?
Now it seems that the ?brains? of both communities prefer to pursue their professions in keeping with their qualifications and shun politics.?
This is more true with the Sinhala community. Within the Tamil community too we see its politicians tending to boycott anything related to politics if things are not going to their liking. The ...... columnist Ahilan Kadirgamar once wrote that the Tamils have been numbed by decades of Tamil Nationalism and LTTE?s totalitarian rule. He encouraged the Tamil community to critically engage in debate and discussions to promote the Tamil cause.??
Sri Lanka needs to see academics enter politics. This is not the time to judge leaders by race, cast and religion. This is an era where leaders must be judged by what they bring as knowledge to the discussion table.?
The ship that is Sri Lanka is gathering speed on a sea of opportunities. We need a captain who can adjust the sails and guide her to a safe port!? ? ?

While we waste food 800 million people go hungry
	
The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) on Tuesday marked World Food Day and in a statement the world body revealed the intolerable wrong of hunger where one person in nine does not have enough to eat.? ?
UN Secretary General Ant?nio Guterres in a statement says that at present more than 815 million people do not have enough to eat. Some 155 million children under the age of five or 23 per cent are chronically malnourished and stunted and may endure the effects of it for the rest of their lives. Worldwide, one in two infant deaths is caused by hunger. This is intolerable. Zero hunger is about joining forces,? the UN Chief says calling for stronger political will and more financial support until everyone has enough and quality food.? ?
At the World Food Day ceremony in Rome speakers echoed the UN chief?s call to action to governments, companies, institutions and individuals.? ?
?People frequently ask me if I really believe that it is possible to eradicate hunger by 2030. My answer is yes, I do,? FAO Director General Jos? Graziano da Silva said noting that his own country, Brazil, had been able to almost eliminate hunger in less than 10 years, from 11 per cent of the population in 2001, to about two per cent in 2010.? ?
?The struggle against hunger urgently demands generous financing, the abolition of trade barriers and, above all, greater resilience in the face of climate change, economic crises and warfare,? Pope Francis said in a message read on his behalf.? ?
Since its early years of existence, the UN has made tackling hunger and malnutrition one of its key priorities. Here are some of the ways the organization is contributing today to achieving zero hunger tomorrow;? Help small farmers produce more with less, Provide emergency food rations in humanitarian crises, End malnutrition, Focus on local economic systems, Develop vulnerability projections and analysis, Empower rural women and girls and Raise awareness and galvanize change.? ?
Despite the UN?s noble objectives and Pope Francis? call for all major religions to work together and give top priority to the crisis of poverty alleviation what we see in the world today is the horror of about ten super billionaires having more than 50 per cent of the world?s wealth and resources. Even in Sri Lanka we see not only the super rich but even middle class people indulging in waste, luxury and extravagance including five-star weddings where they pay more than Rs.10,000 for a meal. Even some lower middle class people, influenced by this bad social example, borrow money at high interest rates to have five-star weddings and end up paying back the loans and interests for several years later thereby not having enough money to provide three meals a day, basic healthcare and education for their children.? ?
Several special events were held in Sri Lanka to mark World Food Day. President Maithripala Sirisena, who has taken a special interest in this subject, even held a meeting of the National Economic Council, which includes top Cabinet ministers and economists. A directive was issued to the Finance Ministry to compile and submit within a week a list of non-essential imported food items so that the imports could be stopped and measures taken to grow these items here.? ?
One area that the NEC needs to address is the import of powdered milk which reportedly costs a staggering Rs.100 million a day. Highly qualified nutritionists have said that powdered milk is largely fake or artificial though marketing agents mislead the people by claiming that if a particular brand is not given, the child?s knowledge cells will not work properly. This nonsense must be stopped and the government needs to take steps to revive our dairy milk industry which thrived till the 1980s when a big transnational company came here and systematically destroyed it.? ?
Not only milk, Sri Lanka has hundreds of nutritious vegetables and fruits which could be grown locally with organic fertiliser. The government needs to promote this on a large scale while eco-friendly and responsible citizens need to develop their home gardens by growing vegetables or fruit trees with the use of organic fertilizer. We hope the World Food Day will give us some food for thought.? ? ?
