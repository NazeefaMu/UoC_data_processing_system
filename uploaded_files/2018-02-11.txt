People have rejected the government- JVP
	
The Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna ( JVP) today said the people had rejected the government as it had put the mandate it received in January 8, 2015 to eradicate corruption and to resolve other issues faced by them.
JVP leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake told a media briefing that the government failed because it was not able to take the nation out of the debt trap and economic turmoil. This he said had helped those who were defeated in 2015 to raise their head.
Mr Dissanayake said the result of the local government election was not the one which the JVP expected but will be happy as it had been able to double it's members in the local bodies. "The corrupted lot which was defeated in 2015 had come back to power, " he said. Therefore, he said there is a greater role for the people to play in the future while JVP will also play a role in it. "The farmers and others will have to seek the JVP support to get their issues resolved and our party will perform its duty accordingly", he said.
JVP General Secretary Tilvin Silva said the people had got the opportunity of getting their expectations fulfilled but one corrupt lot has been brought back to power while sending a similar lot home.
He said JVP has not decided as to whether it would support any party to form administrations in any of the local bodies yet. (Yohan Perera)

We accept the people's verdict: Kabir
	
UNP General Secretary Kabir Hashim in a statement said the UNP would accept the people?s verdict given at the local government elections humbly. ?The people have shown us a danger signal,? he said.
Minister Kabir Hashim said the UNP would analyse the LG polls results closely and resolve to carry out government?s services and duties more diligently and speedily.
?We have done a lot for the people in the last couple of years. We have also introduced a new electoral system at the local government level and has put an end to the intra party and inter party rivalry and minimize election expenditure which leads to corruption. We have also plugged opportunities to use State assets in elections and given much relief to the people in the fields of education and health. But, for our disadvantage the dividends of this services and benefits offered to the people have not been clearly displayed. However, we believe that the people will be in a position before long to enjoy the dividends of our services before long,? Minister Hashim stressed.
?The natural disasters like, floods, droughts and earth slips that devastated the lives of the people in unprecedented proportions and the huge debts, a legacy of the Rajapaksa regime that burdened the economy had affected the lives of the people negatively but all these calamities were beyond the government?s control,?he said.
The people kept the confidence in us for social and economic change at the January 2015 Presidential poll and confirmed it in the August General election. Therefore, we firmly resolve ourselves to fulfil their aspirations on the mandate they have given us and fully committed to realize all their goals, Minister Hashim stressed. (SAJ)
