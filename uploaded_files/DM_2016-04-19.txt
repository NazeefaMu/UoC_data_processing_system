Authority to regulate electronic media
	
The government is considering setting up an independent authority to regulate the electronic media in the near future, sources said.
According to government sources, there had been a request from the electronic media for such an authority.
The sources also said the authority would have the power to handle complaints made against the electronic media just as the press complaints commission does. However, in this case, the authority would be legally bound to investigate the complaints received -- unlike the press complaints commission.
Commenting on the matter, a government official said the authority would be set up with the consent of all media stakeholders without the involvement of the government. It was also averred that there was no intention of controlling the media through the proposed authority. (Yohan Perera)

## Title: Bond auction process back in spotlight

Bond auction process back in spotlight
	
Questions have again been raised over the government securities (G-Secs) auction process as a recent treasury bond issue had accepted triple the amount it offered at a significantly higher interest rate, driving up the governments cost of borrowing.
On March 29, 2016, the Central Bank offered a 14-year and one-month bond (2030 bond) to raise Rs.10 billion. But the bank accepted bids up to Rs.29 billion  almost thrice the amount offered  at a higher rate of 14.23 percent.
The Central Bank denies any irregularities in the process and said the spike in bond yields reflected the recent monetary policy actions and volatile global markets.
However, the bond yield significantly came down on the next day in the secondary market (see illustration), opening up an avenue for those who bought the bonds to make thumping profits by selling them. 
According to economist Murtaza Jaffergee, at a time when the interest rates are going up, it is irrational to borrow for 14 years at an interest rate of 14.23 percent, when you can minimize your exposure by borrowing short term.
If your interest rates are going up and you are vulnerable, and if you still need to borrow more money, you need to borrow short term. Then your exposure is only for the next three or four years. If so, at least you pay the penalty in the short term only, not for 14 years, Jaffergee told a recent forum in Colombo organised by the National Chamber of Commerce. 
However, Central Bank Deputy Governor P. Samarasiri defended the interest rate at which the 2030 bond was issued and said the interest rate could have even gone up to 20 percent levels had not for their debt raising strategies prevented such a spike in yields and the possible market panic. 
According to Samarasiri, there was a last minute money requirement of Rs.105 billion by the government by April 1, 2016. He stressed that had they announced the entire quantum at a single auction, the rates could have even gone up to 20 percent, due to the announcement effect. 
Two days later, on March 31, 2016, the Central Banks treasury bond auction raised Rs.40.1 billion, little more than twice the amount offered. During the two days, the government raised Rs.117.9 billion in total through bonds.
Sri Lankas G-Secs auctions practice the bad habit of accepting bids way higher the amount they offer, raising serious questions over the rationality and transparency of such issues. 
For example, the bond auction on March 29 saw the Central Bank accepting bids worth Rs.77.8 billion in total under different maturities, double the offered amount of Rs.40 billion.
It was only last week the former parliamentary oversight committee on state enterprises  the Committee on Public Enterprises  Chairman D.E.W. Gunasekera demanded explanations from the government for raising bonds at very high rates while insisting on the Central Bank Governor to reveal the primary dealers who bought the bonds.
However, Samarasiri dismissed the allegations calling them baseless and said the rising interest rates in the bills and bond markets reflect the policy decisions taken in recent times to tighten the monetary policy.
Responding to calls for greater transparency in G-Secs auctions, Samarasiri said the Monetary Law Act bars releasing individual information to the public, hence it could not be done.
This is not for Sri Lanka only, from all other Central Banks, the same question is asked: why dont you release individual information As policymakers, we cant do that, Samarasiri told the media during a Central Bank press conference held last week.
Jafferjee, who is also Managing Director of JB Securities (Private) Limited, a Colombo-based stockbroking firm, said there was absolutely no price transparency in the G-Secs market although it was much bigger than the countrys stock market.
In the stock market if anybody trades, everybody knows. Theres total price transparency. The G-Secs market is three to four times bigger than the stock market. But absolutely no price transparency, he said.
However, Samarasiri during the press conference said, These are not the things that you can do telling everybody. I dont know what transparency people are talking about in these kinds of transactions.
Nevertheless, G-Secs yields are used as proxy rates in an economy when pricing all types of assets and commodities such as lands, properties and equities. Hence, the sudden spikes and wide fluctuations in bond yields could have a ripple effect on every citizen of the country. So, this (bond yields) is feeding into prices of every commodity. The price of money is continuously changing and theres going to be a real effect on all of us because the banks will have to start pricing in for this uncertainty which will drive up the cost of borrowing.
Businesses will have to price in the cost of uncertainty in their pricing, Jafferjee cautioned.
It was only over a year ago on February 27, 2015, a series of allegations were levelled against the Central Bank over a bond scam when it accepted 10 times the offer amount of Rs.1 billion for yields up to 12.5 percent  above the target borrowing rate of 9 to 9.5 percent where most of the higher yield bids alleged to have been offered to a primary dealer owned by the son-in-law of the Governor of the Central Bank, causing much stir in the financial markets.

CC had no right to approve name of new IGP: Gammanpila
	
Taking exception to the decision of the Constitutional Councils (CC) to grant approval to the appointment of Senior DIG Pujith Jayasundara as the 34th Inspector General of Police (IGP), Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) General Secretary and MP Udaya Gammanpila claimed the appointment was both illegal and unethical.
Addressing a media briefing today, MP Gammanpila said the CCs approval of Mr. Jayasundara as the IGP went against the 19th Amendment to the Constitution as President Maithripala Sirisena had recommended three senior Police officers to the post of IGP in the wake of the retirement of former IGP N.K. Illangakoon.
According to the 19th Amendment to the Constitution the President should only recommend one name to the CC and its duty was to approve or disapprove the Presidents recommendation. However, the CC has arbitrarily selected Mr. Jayasundara as the IGP from three nominees sent to it and referred his name to the President, he added.
MP Gammanpila recalled the similarity between this appointment and the appointment of the present Attorney General in the wake of the retirement of former AG Yuwanjan Wijeyatilake where seniority was not considered.
Additionally, he said the participation of Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka as a part of the CC which took the decision to appoint SDIG Jayasundara as the new IGP, was wrong as Minister Ranawaka was a suspect in four Police investigations despite the request made by them to refrain from his involvement in it.
Mr. Jayasundara is carrying out investigations into the controversial accident that took place in Rajagiriya where Minister Ranawaka was an accused. Now he has received the blessings of Minister Ranawaka for the post of IGP and as a result he would be obligated to Minister Ranawaka, which sets a bad precedent, he added. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)

India's fighter jet Tejas catches SL attention
	
India's Light Combat Aircraft Tejas, which was several years in the making, has now caught the attention of foreign buyers with Sri Lanka and Egypt evincing interest in the indigenously built fighter jet.
Sri Lanka had recently rejected Pakistan's JF-17 aircraft built with Chinese help, while Egypt had last year signed a contract for 24 French-made Rafale fighter jets.
The two countries are interested in the current version of the Tejas and not the upgraded one which will be rolled out later. 
However, state-run Hindustan Aeronautics Limited, the manufacturer of Tejas, is focusing on delivering the aircraft to the IAF first.
"While there is an interest which has been shown (by other countries), let us get the product first to our own customer. The confidence that will come to others when our own Air Force flies it will be immense. So at first, we should at least meet the initial requirement of the IAF," HAL chairman T Suvarna Raju told PTI.
Refusing to share information on which is the countries that have evinced interest in Tejas, he expressed confidence in his marketing team and said they are equipped to take forward the talks. However, Defence sources said that the two countries which have evinced interest in Tejas were Sri Lanka and Egypt.
He said the "current version is more than enough" for smaller nations.
Two things that go in favour of the Tejas are its lower cost and flying ability.
"We have proved its flying ability and the aircraft, for that class, is a terrific one. We did take some time but we need to remember that DRDO and us did everything from the scratch," Raju said.
Raju said that the upgraded version of Tejas, with Active Electrically Scanned Array Radar, Unified Electronic
Warfare Suite, mid-air refuelling capacity and beyond the vision range missiles, will cost between Rs 275 crore and Rs 300 crore.
Sources said enquiries by foreign countries came during the Bahrain air show in January, the first time that Tejas flew outside the country.
The decision to send Tejas abroad was of Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar, who has put his weight behind the aircraft.
LCA Tejas performed 8-G (gravity) pull, vertical loop, slow fly-past and barrel roll at the air show, which the
Indian officials described as "historic".
Interestingly, soon after the announcement of Tejas' participation in Bahrain, Pakistan had withdrawn its JF-17 aircraft from the show despite having paid the initial installment which ran into a few millions US dollars.
Tejas is perhaps the world's smallest lightweight, multi-role single engine tactical fighter aircraft.
JF-17 has been developed jointly by the Pakistan Aeronautical Complex and the Chengdu Aircraft Corporation of
China. However, experts feel that the aircraft has been assembled in Pakistan from readymade Chinese kits.
HAL is likely to hand over the fourth Tejas aircraft to the Air Force by June end. The four aircraft will make up the first squadron of IAF which will be used for training and familarisation.
Rather than wait for LAC Mk II, IAF had decided to go for an upgraded version of the existing Tejas with over 40 modifications.
IAF plans to acquire 120 Tejas aircraft, with 100 of these having major modifications.
As per the production plan, six aircraft will be made this year and HAL will subsequently scale it up to eight and 16 aircraft per year.
The LCA programme was initiated in 1983 to replace the ageing MiG-21s planes in IAF's combat fleet but has missed several deadlines due to various reasons.

Mozambique debris almost certainly from MH370
	
Two pieces of debris recovered from beaches in Mozambique -- one found last December and the other in February -- almost certainly came from missing Malaysia Airlines flight 370, the Australian Transport Safety Bureau said Tuesday.
"Part No. 1 was a flap track fairing segment, almost certainly from the Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777 aircraft, registered 9M-MRO," the Safety Bureau report said of the piece found December 27.
The second piece of debris was found February 27, approximately 135 miles (220 kilometers) from the spot where the first item was discovered.
"Part No. 2 was a horizontal stabilizer panel segment, almost certainly from the Malaysian Airlines Boeing 777 aircraft, registered 9M-MRO," the report said.
MH370's disappearance is one of the world's biggest aviation mysteries. The plane vanished from radar on March 8, 2014 while en route from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, to Beijing, with 239 people on board. (CNN)

Nine illegal migrants on way to Australia nabbed
	
Nine Sri Lankan illegal immigrants who were heading towards Australia were apprehended by the Navy in the seas off Negambo on Monday.
The Navy said five men, a woman, two boys and a girl were among the apprehended people onboard.
The migrants had left from the Negombo harbour onboard a Multi-Day Fishing Vessel. They were apprehended on a tip off received by intelligence personnel and they were brought to Colombo Harbour and handed over to the Maritime Division of Police Criminal Investigation Division, they said.
The Navy reiterated that there was no means of heading towards Australia by illegal methods and that Sri Lanka was very strict with regard to such migration.
However, people keep on venturing and losing their hard earned money based on the bogus information given by human smugglers and finally become convicts in the hands of law. Due to the deployment of Sri Lanka Navys regular patrols and strong network of intelligence it is impossible to break the shackles of the Navy and flee free, they said.

VAC charges MS, RW of nepotism
	
President Maithripala Sirisenas brother, who is the Chairman of the Sri Lanka Telecom (SLT), had awarded the insurance deal of Mobitel to a company owned by someone close to him causing Rs. 3 billion loss to the Government, the Voice Against Corruption (VAC) charged today.
VAC Convener and JVP Provincial Councillor Wasantha Samarasinghe claimed the SLT Chairman was receiving a monthly allowance of Rs. 750,000 as his house rent.
He said that he had also increased allowances receiving from the companies to Rs. 1 million from previous Rs. 500,000.
This is the highest in the history of allowances received by an SLT Chairman. Also, the advertising of the company had been awarded to an advertising firm owned by President Sirisenas son-in-law.
Both the President and the Prime Minister are promoting nepotism instead of putting an end to it as pledged during the election, he charged.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe appointed his friend Arjuna Mahendran as the Central Bank Governor and today he is in the centre of a heap of allegations, he said.
He said nepotism was one among many allegations levelled against former president Mahinda Rajapaksa and had even cost him his Presidency.
Today, President Sirisena and Prime Minister are following the same footsteps, he said.
Meanwhile, Mr. Samarasinghe said large scale corruption was taking place at the LTL Holdings (Pvt) Ltd, a company owned by the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB), similar to the Avant Garde Maritime Security Service.
The LTL Holdings also administered by retired CEB officials -similar to Avant Garde operations handled by retired naval officers. This is the company, which had funded previous Power and Energy Ministers during their elections. All Power and Energy Ministers are responsible for the corrupt deals, which had taken place at the LTL, he said.
He said the CEB owned up to 63 percent of shares of the LTL and when the company was to be brought before the Committee On Public Enterprises (COPE) to probe corrupt deals, the officials tried to reduce the shares to 49 percent.
When the percentage of shares owned by the State in a company is less than 49%, that company can get away with facing the COPE. This is what the LTL officials are trying to do. However, this had not yet been successful due to the objections of the engineers, he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)
