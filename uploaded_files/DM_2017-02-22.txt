A diplomat due to play a double role
	

A person with past ties with the department handling law and order is about to get a diplomatic posting to a mid-east country.

This worthy served as our envoy in an African country during the previous regime and later he found himself in the limelight following much hullabaloo created over a grand mansion.
The name of this person for the said diplomatic appointment was proposed by a big-mouthed purohita who shed much sweat to usher in yahapalanaya, they say.The new appointee has been hand-picked for the diplomatic posting mainly to get him to carry out a secret job much more important for the government than the duties he is to perform as the countrys envoy. If the man successfully carried out his main assignment, some top men in the Green party would find themselves in boiling water and it would lead to a radical change in the countrys political landscape as well,
they say.

A golden literature for the wood industry in Sri Lanka
	
Basic Technology of Dendro Science (Wood working) by Channa Wijesekara is a great contribution to the Sri Lankan Dendro/ wood industry, as a reliable source of correct information for the industry as well as for learners of the technology who cannot easily find wood technology basics in one local book. This book has been already published in Sinhala by this author for the majority of readers and practitioners in Sri Lanka who can understand the subject in their mother tongue. This is an evidence of the authors vision of giving the knowledge to the majority of the society and the industry in Sri Lanka. Both English and Sinhala versions could be used in Technical education courses to teach not only Wood Science, but also to improve English usage of students and practitioners while learning the subject, leading them to gather more knowledge from international sources. 
The author, Channa Wijesekara is much more competent not only to write about basics of this industry, but also to write on any aspect of this wood industry. He is a very busy leading industrialist in Sri Lanka and also the current President of the Wood and Wood Based industrialists Association and Chairman of the Advisory Council for the Ministry of Commerce & industries on Wood Based industries. 
He is the Founder/Managing Director of Leema Creations (Pvt) Ltd., a leading and modem wood based industrial organization that received several national awards for its high standards in all aspects. He has nearly 35 years of experience in the wood-related industry, from production to being the business leader of the sector, while disseminating his knowledge and experience for the advancement of the industry.
He has obtained most of his industrial and management knowledge with experience from higher education in Germany, whereas he received his Civil Engineering basic Diploma training from the University of Moratuwa, Sri Lanka. 
Channa Wijesekara has become qualified to the highest level of his industry by setting an example as an entrepreneur and an industrialist, and not as an expert theoretician of Dendro/ wood science who can only advice but cannot produce a simple marketable product. His overall knowledge of both theory & practice, and rare experience as a specific industrialist should be made available to the future entrepreneurs and the industry personnel. I understand this book starts from basics to fill a vacuum in this sector of the industry in Sri Lanka, moving through the Knowledge-Economy which needs Knowledge-Worker industrialists.

Big powers clip UN secretary generals wings
	

By Colum Lynch 
(c) 2017,Foreign Policy   
U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres may be the worlds most visible diplomat. But he is quickly learning that he is far from the most powerful. 
In his first weeks on the job, Guterres sought to shake up the big-power monopoly on top U.N. posts, and cast a wider recruiting net, hiring a Nigerian politician as his deputy and a Brazilian diplomat as his chief of staff. 
But his attempts to install aspirants outside the exclusive club of the five veto-wielding U.N. powers - Britain, China, France, Russia and the United States - to lead the U.N.s sprawling peacekeeping, political and humanitarian relief operations have largely run aground. That has dashed the hopes of smaller member countries and outside groups seeking a break from his predecessor Ban Ki Moon, who was criticized for being too beholden to the five permanent members of the Security Council. 
The U.N. announced Tuesday that a French diplomat, Jean-Pierre Lacroix, will head up the U.N. peacekeeping department for one year, extending a 20-year lock on the job. Meanwhile, Britain and China remain favourites to retain control over the departments responsible for co-ordinating U.N. emergency relief operations and economic and social affairs. And the United States will keep the top political job, which it has held for the past decade, after Guterres tried and failed to persuade Obama administration officials to allow a national outside the big five powers to take on the role. Guterres has asked Jeffrey Feltman, an Obama appointee, to remain as under secretary general in the department of policy affairs until April, 2018. 
The French and British dug in, insisting that they hold on to the top jobs at heading the U.N. peacekeeping and emergency relief efforts, according to the official. 
Any hope the Trump administration would show more flexibility on the jobs front were quickly dashed when Nikki Haley, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, publicly blocked Guterres appointment of former Palestinian Prime Minister, Salam Fayyad, as the head of the U.N. mission in Libya. 
The scuttling of Fayyads appointment has driven home the fact that Guterres faces serious political constraints in calling his own shots, said Richard Gowan, a U.N. expert at the European Council on Foreign Relations. But Gowan said Guterres may have an ace in his hand. 
Guterres placed a time limit on Tuesdays appointments, committing only to keeping French and American leadership of the peacekeeping and political departments for a year. In the meantime, his office will carry out plans for a reorganization of the U.N. bureaucracy that could eliminate some of these posts or merge them. 
If Guterres is smart, he can use the reorganization to strengthen his own position by reducing the power of the department heads beneath him, Gowan argued. 
Guterres is now grappling with simmering resentment from the rest of the U.N.s 193 governments, who sought assurances during his campaign that he would end the big-power monopoly that they believe runs contrary of the spirit of the U.N. Charter and a succession of resolutions by the U.N. General Assembly that explicitly call for an end to the practice. 
A group of 25 countries that recently called on Guterres to open the top jobs up for competition among nationals from the U.N.s 193 member states. Those groups are now frustrated that the selection of senior appointees is largely playing out in secret. 
Breaking the big powers hold on the senior jobs is the only way he can truly ensure the independence of the U.N.s policies or advice, argued Carne Ross, the founder of Independent Diplomat, a New York-based nonprofit that provides diplomatic advisory services to the United Nations. 
The appointment process has long fueled suspicions that U.N. Secretaries General have traded top jobs to big powers in exchange for supporting their candidacies. That perception can do serious damage to the U.N. ability to serve as an honest brokers, said Bob Orr, a former top official in Kofi Annans and Ban Ki-moons administrations.

Chastised and quietened
	

The disposal of the city garbage had been a perennial problem and the authorities finally decided with the nod of the top two in yahapalanaya to bury the garbage on a piece of fallow land in Ja-ela area.

The removal of city garbage to the new site on a regular basis was underway when a deputy purohita known for his shenanigans began leading a series of public protests demanding an immediate halt to the transporting of garbage to the new yard.
The Deputy had failed to enlist the participation of the young Diyawanna member of the same party looking after the constituency in the protest action nor had he kept the latter informed of it and feeling affronted the member had complained to the party leader against the Deputy for invading his home turf. The party leader livid with anger over the Deputys antics had reprimanded and warned the latter to behave himself.
The rebuke had instant effect for the Deputy soon faded from the scene. The fear of being denied party nomination at the next general poll may have led the politico to beat a hasty retreat, they say.

Could reporters be hunted down if Trump goes after leakers
	

By Margaret Sullivan 
(c) 2017, The Washington Post  
For those who care about press rights in America, President Donald Trumps words last week were stunning and disturbing. 
The news media is not merely scum, as he has said many times before, but now the enemy of the American People. 
This tweeted pronouncement, with its authoritarian echoes, came soon after Trumps vow to stamp out the unauthorized flow of intelligence-community information to journalists. Ive actually called the Justice Department to look into the leaks, he said. Those are criminal leaks. 
Add up these two elements and you get a troubling question: Will the Trump administrations crackdown on leaks include journalists as well as their sources 
Some knowledgeable lawyers and academics say its unlikely. 
Right now, its a deviant practice, certainly not in the ordinary course of business, to subpoena a journalist, said David Pozen, a Columbia University law professor who wrote the landmark study The Leaky Leviathan: Why the Government Condemns and Condones Unlawful Disclosures of Information. 
But, Pozen told me: If were in a new paradigm, that could change. 
That such things are changing already was evident in Trumps statement, quoted above, about making an assignment for Justice Department officials - who, after all, are supposed to operate with a measure of independence, choosing their own cases, not as corporate functionaries reporting to the chief executive. 
As for a new paradigm, it - or something else quite weird - was on full display in that news conference in which Trump hardly stopped attacking the assembled news media. That surreal 75 minutes included mind-spinning contradictions about real leaks somehow creating fake news. 
But wait, you might say. Why should journalists be treated any differently from any other citizens Why shouldnt they testify about their sources or even be prosecuted themselves when information obtained illegally is published 
Well, because the democracy is built on their ability to serve as a check on government power. They need to be able to do their watchdog job unfettered, and to tell citizens at least some of what their government is doing in secret. A crucial part of that is the ability to promise confidentiality to sources. 
Oddly enough, if the Trump administration goes down the dangerous road of eroding those freedoms, its the Obama administration that will have set those wheels in motion. Nine times during the past eight years, the Justice Department used the once-obscure Espionage Act to prosecute leakers - three times the usage of any other administration since the law was enacted 100 years ago. 
And reporters were drawn into the fray. 
Investigative reporter James Risen of the New York Times faced the very real possibility of jail time for protecting a confidential source during the leak investigation of Jeffrey Sterling, a former CIA officer. More extreme still was the Justice Departments naming of another Washington journalist, James Rosen of Fox News, as a criminal co-conspirator in a different leak case, thus allowing the government to track his phone calls, emails and trips to the State Department. 
And it was partly because of the strong criticism of these efforts - both of which eventually were dropped - that new Justice Department guidelines were agreed upon. Then-attorney general Eric Holder eventually said publicly that he never wanted a journalist go to jail for doing his work. But the blueprint was there. 
One of the recent guidelines calls for the attorney general himself to sign off before a reporter is subpoenaed. That sounds like a formidable obstacle, but in his confirmation hearing earlier this month, Jeff Sessions ducked the question of what he would do. 
You might think the First Amendment would protect journalists from getting drawn into court. After all, cases that rely on the First Amendment, especially one related to the Pentagon Papers, prohibit the government from prior restraint of publication. 
But when it comes to the so-called reporters privilege, case law is notoriously shaky, and Justice Department guidelines enacted in recent years are well-intentioned but toothless. 
The protections are normative, not legal, said Susan Hennessey, managing editor of the Lawfare blog and a former National Security Agency attorney. 
And folks, we dont live in Normal Town any more. 
Separately, congressional efforts to enact a federal shield law - like those in many states - have seemed promising, but gone nowhere. 
Instead, journalists remain dependent on something far less certain: what former deputy attorney general James M. Cole (referring to the Justice Department guidelines that he helped develop) called a shadow shield law. 
Trump, meanwhile, has seen the enemy. And it is, well, us. 
His media attacks apparently signal strength and resolve to his core supporters. Make no mistake: This is a calculated move on his part - and, politically, a proven winner. 
Will he or his advisers take the next logical step against the opposition party, as they call journalists, and pull them into damaging court battles  If so, a shadow shield law sounds like pretty flimsy protection.

Leader of National Freedom Front Wimal Weerawansa today said that five members belonging to his party will function independently in opposition and that they should be recognized as a separate party in Parliament.
Mr. Weerawansa said he has informed the Speaker about this decision in writing earlier and the latter had failed to heed the request.
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya who responded said Mr. Weerawansa had only handed him a letter but did not make a public statement about it. He said the UPFA leadership had informed him that Mr. Weerawansa had not notified his decision to him. However, Mr. Weerawansa said he did make a statement and that he would send a copy of the hazard.
Minister Rauff Hakeem said there is precedent that an MP or MPs who contest from one party is not recognized as a separate group. Accordingly, he said his request to recognize SLMC as a separate group in the House was not accepted as his party had contested the re-election under the elephant symbol.
MP Dinesh Gunawardene said former Speaker Chamal Rajapaksa has given a ruling that parties in the House are recognized as separate groups if their leaders are elected as MPs. (Yohan Perera)

High-level Chinese delegation in marathon talks with SL
	
A Chinese delegation headed by Assistant Minister of Foreign Affairs, Kong Xuanyou is reported to have held five hours of discussions with the Sri Lankan authorities on the entire gamut of bilateral relations.
The delegation arrived in Sri Lanka on Monday in the wake of some of the proposed Chinese investments in the country hitting a snag amid public protests and legal action.
The Government has sought to hand over an 80 per cent stake in the Hambantota Port to a Chinese company known as China Merchants on a debt to equity swap. However, the project ran into turmoil after public protests against the move to acquire 15,000 acres of land for investments integrated with the port development project.
It has also been challenged in the Supreme Court.
Mr. Xuanyou met Minister of Foreign Affairs Mangala Samaraweera. The Chinese delegation comprises officials from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Chinese Embassy including Ambassador Yi Xianliang.
Meanwhile, a high profile Chinese delegation is to visit Sri Lanka this year. Earlier, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe invited his Chinese counterpart Li Keqiang to visit Sri Lanka. (Kelum Bandara)

Several of the smaller parties like the JVP will be affected by the proposed cut-off point. Therefore, we will join them to reduce it to two or three per cent, JO National Organiser Dullas Alahapperuma told a news conference. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Lobby talk on crossovers
	

Most Diyawanna members usually trade barbs across the floor during debates in the chamber, but when meeting in the council lobby, they greet one another cordially and exchange light-hearted banter forgetting party differences.

The main topic that Diyawanna members from both sides discuss at their lobby encounters these days is the possible pole-vaults from one side to the other. The other day at such an encounter, a government member addressed several JO members in a derisive tone: You people keep harping that there are a number of members from the government members set to cross over to your side. But do you know that there are at least five JO members about to join the government ranks
This is what you people have been saying all along, an opposition replied. If you are so sure, name them! he challenged.
I dont like to name them. But I can name the district they come from so that you can guess correctly who they are!
Okay, name the districts!
The government member mentioned the districts Matara, Mahanuwara, Galle, Anuradhapura and Kalutara. They assert that would like to join the government for they have realized the need of a national unity government at this grave hour for the nation and while taking such a high moral ground, they insist in the same breath that they be given some responsible portfolios, the government member said.
And they are only waiting for the Green signal! another government member interposed with a loud guffaw.

A group of 122 Sri Lankan women, who were allegedly harassed by their employers in Kuwait, returned to the country today, Foreign Employment Minister Thalatha Atukorale said.
Minister Atukorale told a media briefing that 44 migrant workers who returned to the country had lived in safe houses after they faced various issues at their work places.The balance 78 were staying back illegally and were told to go back. All the workers had faced issues ranging from expired contracts, non-payment of wages and physical harassment at their places of employment, the minister said.
The minister said the Sri Lanka Foreign Employment Bureau (SLFEB) had provided them with the necessary funds and also contacted their families.
Meanwhile, a Sri Lankan housemaid, who has been made to work in Kuwait since 2003 without being paid for 11 years, was paid what was owed to her in the way of salary arrears and brought back to the country yesterday with the intervention of Minister Atukorale.
The woman was identified as Mohommed Aliyaar Kairuniza, 28, a resident of Batticaloa who went to Kuwait to work as a housemaid when she was 14 using fraudulent documents.
After the SLFEB officials intervened, the employer had agreed to pay her salary with arrears amounting to Rs.2.5 million for eleven years.
It was also reported that she had been in contact with her father for the first two years after reaching Kuwait and had transferred her salary to her father's bank account in Sri Lanka.
However, her employer had informed her not to send money to Sri Lanka after her fathers demise and had promised her to pay her accumulated salaries when she wanted to return back to Sri Lanka. Kairuniza worked only for a single employer. She was unable to contact her family during that entire time and her family have not even made a complaint to the bureau regarding the matter, the minster said. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)

1.4 million children face famine in four countries: UNICEF
	

Almost 1.4 million children suffering from severe malnutrition could die this year from famine in Nigeria, Somalia, South Sudan and Yemen, the UN childrens agency said Monday. 
In Yemen, where war has been raging for nearly two years, 462,000 children are suffering from acute malnutrition while 450,000 children are severely malnourished in northeast Nigeria. 
Fews Net, the famine early warning system, said some remote areas of Nigerias Borno state are already affected by famine since late last year and the disaster is likely to continue as aid agencies are unable to reach those in need. 
Drought in Somalia has left 185,000 children on the brink of famine but that figure is expected to reach 270,000 in the next few months, said UNICEF. 
In South Sudan, over 270,000 children are malnourished and a famine has just been declared in parts of Unity State in the north of the country, where 20,000 children live. 
UNICEF director Anthony Lake appealed for quick action. We can still save many lives, he said. 
UN Security Council ambassadors are due to travel to northern Nigeria, Cameroon, Chad and Niger next month to draw international attention to the humanitarian crisis triggered by the conflict with Boko Haram militants.

North Korea: Malaysia cant be trusted to investigate the killing of leaders half brother
	

By Anna Fifield 
(c) 2017, The Washington Post   
SEOUL -- Tensions between North Korea and Malaysia became even more heated Monday, when Pyongyangs envoy said Malaysia could not be trusted to carry out the investigation into last weeks killing of leader Kim Jong Uns half brother and the Malaysian prime minister defended the investigation as objective. 
The war of words is striking because Malaysia has been one of the few countries that North Korea could count as a friend. But it underscores the stakes for the Kim regime, which is widely accused of orchestrating the sensational assassination of Kim Jong Nam, the North Korean leaders estranged older half brother, at Kuala Lumpur airport last week. 
South Koreas prime minister said Monday that his government was certain that Pyongyang was behind the act of terrorism. 
In the latest dramatic developments, Kim Han Sol, the 20-something son of Kim Jong Nam, is thought to have arrived in Kuala Lumpur Monday night. Local media reported that he was on a flight from Macau, where the family is based, to the Malaysian capital, and staked out the airport for hours. But there was no sign of him, perhaps because he was whisked out through a private exit to avoid the media scrum. 
Malaysian authorities have been insisting on a DNA match before releasing the body, so Kim Han Sol could have arrived to provide it. 
Adding to the intrigue: closed-circuit TV footage released Monday showing the attack on Kim Jong Nam at the Kuala Lumpur airport. The 45-year-old North Korean is seen going to the check-in kiosk, when two women ambush him and appear to apply what authorities have said was poison. He is seen going up to airport staff and re-enacting the attack. Kim Jong Nam was still able to walk, although increasingly slowly, so the staff took him to a clinic in the airport. 
Photos obtained by Japanese media showed him slumped in a chair in the clinic. He died in an ambulance en route to hospital shortly after. 
North Korea has become angrier by the day over the case, accusing Malaysia of colluding with South Korea to try to make it look bad, and of committing human rights abuses in the way the autopsy was conducted and its treatment of a North Korean suspect and his family. 
We cannot trust the investigation by the Malaysian police, Kang Chol, Pyongyangs envoy, told reporters outside the North Korean Embassy in Kuala Lumpur on Monday afternoon, noting that there had been no evidence released of the cause of death even a week after the attack. 
It only increases the doubt that there could be someone elses hand behind the investigation, he said, echoing a previous allegation that South Korea was trying to malign North Korea, and accusing Malaysia of defaming his country. 
He proposed that North Korea and Malaysia open a joint investigation into Kim Jong Nams death. 
Kangs statement came after he was summoned to the Malaysian foreign ministry over his criticism of Kuala Lumpurs investigation. Meanwhile, Malaysia recalled its ambassador to Pyongyang for consultations. 
Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak on Monday rejected the suggestion of a joint investigation, saying that his governments investigation into the killing would be objective and that Malaysian police and doctors were very professional. 
We have no reason why we want to do something to paint North Korea in a bad light, Najib told reporters in Kuala Lumpur. I have absolute confidence that they are objective in whatever they do. 
North Korea had strongly objected to Malaysias decision to conduct a postmortem on Kim Jong Nam, and then went on a public tirade when it emerged it was inconclusive and that a second examination would be needed. The results could be out Wednesday.

Their attempt to mangle again his body [and] not to release [it] is the culmination of human rights abuse and shows once again how they are desperate to shift blame on us, Kang said in a statement that he read to reporters. 
With one North Korean in custody in Malaysia and at least four of his compatriots suspected of involvement, South Korea voiced increasing certainty that the North Korean regime was behind the assassination. 
It seems clear that the North Korean regime is behind this case, Hwang Kyo-ahn, the South Korean prime minister who is now acting as president, told a meeting of the National Security Council on Monday. 
The apparent assassination of Kim Jong Nam was an unacceptable, inhumane, criminal act and Pyongyang should be punished for committing the act of terrorism, he said. 
His pronouncement came after Malaysia released information on four North Koreans who had been in Kuala Lumpur for several weeks but left on the day of the attack. 
The man who has been arrested is 47-year-old Ri Jong Chol, who is said to have a background in chemistry and to have studied in India. A Facebook page belonging to a Ri Jong Chol who studied at Kim Il Sung University and lists his home as Pyongyang features a profile photo of a man wearing gloves in a science lab. 
The other four named by Malaysia as suspects are now back in North Korea, having gone to great lengths to avoid going through China - the most direct route - to get home. They appear to have flown from Kuala Lumpur to Jakarta, Indonesia, then to Dubai and on to Vladivostok, Russia, before traveling from there to Pyongyang. 
It is not known why they went to such trouble, although China had been protecting Kim Jong Nam, who had lived in quasi-exile in Beijing and the Chinese territory of Macau for about the past 15 years.

Rupee falls for 5th session as foreign investors sell rupee bonds
	
REUTERS: The Sri Lankan rupee declined for a fifth straight session yesterday as offshore investors sold government securities amid concerns over further depreciation in the local currency, dealers said.
Dollar demand from importers and foreign banks also weighed on the rupee, they said.
Rupee forwards were active with one-month forwards closing at 153.20/35 per dollar, weaker than Mondays close of 152.95/153.15.
Two-week forwards ended at 152.70/90 per dollar, weaker than Mondays close of 151.70/75 per dollar.
There was no supply (of dollars) in the market and there were outflows with foreigners selling government rupee bonds, said a currency dealer, requesting not to be named.
Sri Lanka could face balance-of-payments pressure due to foreign outflows from government securities, a government document showed on Thursday, even as the island-nation is in the process of raising up to US $2.5 billion from foreign borrowing.
Foreign investors net sold Rs.49.1 billion (US $325.70 million) worth of government securities in the seven weeks to Feb. 15, more than the total net foreign outflow of US $324.3 million in 2016, according to the latest Central Bank and government data.
Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake said on Feb. 14 that protecting a fragile rupee was more important than controlling interest rates as the local currency tended not to rebound after depreciating.
Central Bank Governor Indrajit Coomaraswamy said early this month that the bank was not planning to abruptly stop supporting the rupee.
The rupee has weakened 1.1 percent so far this year, under pressure from rising imports and net selling of government securities by foreign investors.
It fell 3.9 percent last year, following a 10 percent drop in 2015.

Seeking emancipation through wealth
	

We have heard of business tycoons who count their days earnings in terms of millions. But we dont normally hear of moneyed persons among those who have renounced all pleasures and comforts of lay life. The hero of this story is a cleric belonging to the latter category.

This cleric residing in an area which abounds in Banyan (Nuga) trees is known to be involved in many areas of government activity and is said to be holding a high office in the government that brings him a five-figure pay packet every month.
The other day this cleric had called at a state-owned institution to leave in its custody a big bundle of precious notes.
The bundle of notes he left in the safe custody represents the fruits of meritorious deeds he had performed for the wellbeing of various parties, they say.

Yahapalanaya government in retrospect
	
The present government came to power pledging to establish good governance. According to a publication by the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific the main characteristics of good governance include being participatory, consensus oriented, accountable, transparent, responsive, effective, efficient, equitable, inclusive and follows the rule of law. Good governance is supposed to minimize corruption. The views of minorities and vulnerable people should be taken into consideration when making decisions. While certain characteristics are reflected in the activities of the current regime it seems that certain characteristics have been overlooked as well. The present govt. has come under heavy criticism by the very parties that thrived to make them victorious at the 2015 Presidential election. Against this backdrop the Dailymirror asked a few parties who were once very vocal in overthrowing the past regime and establishing the current govt. on its merits
and demerits.
The economic front is not very good
The judiciary is independent to a greater extent. It will take at least another two to three years to ensure the independence of the police and the public service though they are comparatively independent now, he said. 
Commenting on the economic situation of the country he said, We have been a debt ridden country for many years and therefore the economic front is not very good. There has to be consistency of the economic policies. Now the government is at least attempting to have consistency. They have taken serious steps to win the international community which we had lost previously. 
When asked about the demerits of the government he said that the people involved in corruption and who were holding high authority were not penalized, but were instead retained in office. 
The government does not have a good communication strategy. So the positive actions they take are not communicated to the public. The print and private media are not favouring the government. They were linked very closely to the previous regime and they continue to support them, he said. 
He also said that since the government was a coalition of two main parties positives and negative will have to be experienced. In both sides there are people who want to have their own government instead of a coalition. That is seen in many aspects. If the President and Prime Minister are committed to push the social political reforms together there is still hope, he added. 
Elaborating on the way forward, Weliamuna said that the President and Prime Minister should make decisions together. They have to take bold decisions as well. For example they must get rid of the corrupt few high officials. They must take harsh but realistic decisions on Macro Economic decisions. You cant please the people all the time, he said. 


There is a lack of communication and it leads to confusion and a sense of drift
As far as the future of the yahapalanaya government is concerned what is absolutely necessary is for there to be a strategic communication plan which is unveiled and which requires the government to go out and champion both a new constitution, transitional justice and all the other aspects of its reform programme in a conversation with the people of this country. There is a lack of communication and this is leading to confusion and a sense of drift. This has to be rectified very importantly if this government is, in full or substantial measure, to achieve its reform programme, said Dr. Paikiasothy Saravanamuttu, the Executive Director of the Centre for Policy Alternatives (CPA). 

He said that there were still many promises with regards to transitional justice and constitutional reform to be fulfilled. Now, it is not at all clear that the government is not going to fulfil them but certainly there seems to be concern that it is taking time. It is very important that the promises with regards to anti-corruption are kept. We have not yet had a conviction in respect of a major case, he added. 

The government has failed miserably in fulfilling peoples aspirations
The government has failed miserably in fulfilling peoples aspirations which were manifested through various parties in the presidential campaign. 
Now their activities are in line with the narrow agendas of the political elite. Rather than critically engaging,the government does things in an extremely arbitrary manner. When there is a lot of criticism about the development strategy they are not ready to discuss them. They are not willing to listen to the people who brought this government into power, he said. 
Toppling the government is not possible because constitutionally you need to win the support of the majority in parliament. Therefore I dont see any big obstacle for them to continue until the next election, he remarked. 
He noted, however, that the government was not popular among the populace. They are not popular among the Southern Sinhala Buddhist constituency. The Tamils in the North, though not so happy, dont mind this government in power because they cant afford to create a situation where the Rajapaksas come back, he said. 
He added that the government was at an advantage as its dissenting forces are divided. 

We have our hopes with the govt.
The 19th Amendment which curtailed the power of the executive president and the establishment of the independent commissions to have a proper, efficient, public service without political influence.Then there is the constitutional council which is an independent body. The Right to Information Act has been implemented, he added. 
As a whole I believe there is an atmosphere of freedom. Anyone can criticize the President, Prime Minister or the government without fear of being harmed. We didnt have this freedom during the previous regime where we can draw examples of media persons being abducted, and murdered. That situation has changed now, he said. 
This is seen today in how demonstrations are held on a daily basis by doctors, students, and various trade unions. So you can see the democratic freedom exercised by a vast majority of our population which opened up after this government came to power, he remarked. 
Commenting on the negative aspect of the current government Viyangoda said that the people are very much dissatisfied with the government for not bringing to book those alleged to have been involved in mega deals during the previous regime. But up till now nothing has been done except the prosecution of certain individuals who are kept in remand and later bailed out. No single case has been completed. No one has been convicted except Duminda Silva who was accused of murder. This was not organized by the government of that time. It was an individual who was involved. That is why the law was not obstructed, he said. 
They said that billions of money was squandered by the previous government. You dont see anybody being brought before courts, he added. 
He noted that there was delay in bringing the new constitution. We have pledged to the international community on the transitional justice process. Under this process we have been obliged to open the Office of Missing Persons. Though the act was passed in parliament, the office has not been opened. As far as the new constitution is concerned they have appointed six sub committees and a main committee. But it seems that everything has come to a standstill, he said. 
Two years have passed but still there is doubt about the new constitution and the devolution of power as the solution to the ethnic friction. Yet, we have our hopes with the government. There are so many practical problems in making this a reality which we can understand. At the same time we have some suspicion that high ups in the new government are interfering in certain investigations which are going on. If our politicians can keep away from those investigations justice can be meted out very soon. That is what the people expect from the government. he added.

You reap what you sow
	
What kind of humans are we is the most crucial question facing our country today. People from across the world, especially Sri Lankan expatriates, come here to party. I had an acquaintance who told me that Singaporeans, because of the rigidity and discipline in their country, come to Sri Lanka and its resorts to party. But that is not life. This nation has serious problems to resolve. 
What kind of people are we I address this question to all government, business, religious and education leaders. and yes to every parent. 
Do unto others what you would have them do unto you. This is known universally, as the Golden Rule which must be at the core of all human behaviour and action. I am talking about what kind of people or human beings we are. What kind of human beings are our parents, schools, universities, professional bodies and religious leaders producing What is the moral law that governs the behaviour of every one of us in our classrooms, boardrooms and workplaces Are we teaching the principle that must guide every one of us - Do unto others what you want done unto you 
The only test that matters in leadership is leadership by example. What example are the leaders in our companies, public institutions, parliament, schools, universities, homes and religious institutions setting 
The Human Resources Manager in one of our most admired companies sent me a message on Friday: I will talk to you on Monday. She never did. There are so many like her in ordinary positions and in positions of leadership for whom I have the only message: Do unto others what you want done unto you. Keeping your word defines who you are as a person. Always keep a promise. This is the essence of business and corporate governance. 
Return every phone call. Reply to every email or text message. This is what you want done to you. Do we only respond to people we want to Do we only love or like people who love or like us in return Dont avoid people you disagree with or dont like. Do you want to be avoided Dont judge a person based on innuendo and rumour. Give every person a hearing. It is the right thing to do. It is what you want done to you. What you sow you WILL reap. No one escapes. 
Great German Philosopher Emmanuel Kant observed: Two things strike me with awe; the starry heavens above and the moral law within. No one escapes the moral law. No one takes their millions or billions with them when they leave this earth. If every one of us can think of one human being we have harmed, we must reconcile with this person. We must do the right thing and do unto others what we want done to us. 
A wise man once said: If you want to see where a nation is going, take a look at its people. Just look at the streets of a city like Colombo. It is the law of the jungle. I know it is heaven compared to the streets of Chennai or Calcutta. Look at the behaviour of almost every driver. Sri Lanka is a Buddhist country. So is Thailand. But look at the courtesy and respect that Bangkok drivers show each other. On our streets, we must begin today, doing what we want done to us. 
In the hospitality industry and in government offices, I have seen so many employees talk to each other with no or little respect. In Sri Lanka, do we treat foreigners with more respect than we treat our own people Do we really respect each other 
Let us examine and resolve today to do unto others what we want done to us. More than being a rational animal, man is a rationalising animal, rationalising all his or her behaviour, a famous psychiatrist once told us. Leadership in our public institutions, our homes and our businesses must be by example.  We can do better. We must do better as a person and as a nation. Only then will Sri Lanka as a nation regain its proper place in the global community and in the ratings of Fitch, Standard and Poors and Moodys.
