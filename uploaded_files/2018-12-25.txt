An Indian viewpoint Emerging South Asian scenario
	
India is circumventing this problem by building other networks
	The first BIMSTEC military exercise was held in Pune in September 2018
?
Despite striking similarities in culture and a shared history going back to ancient times, South Asia is one of the least integrated regions in the world. But there are visible signs of change both within South Asia and in the way the world looks at the region, avers? Dr. Swaran Singh, Professor at the Center for International Politics, Organization and Disarmament, Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi.?
Currently a Senior Fellow at the Institute of National Security Studies Sri Lanka (NSSSL), Dr. Singh says that there is an increasing realisation, both among the constituent countries of the region and the world powers, that South Asia has to be seen as a whole in strategic, economic and developmental terms.
Changes?
?Anyone looking at South Asia as a whole, will notice two things: Firstly, there is visible prosperity. India, which is the biggest country in the region, is now among countries with the fastest rate of growth. Secondly, all countries in the region are now democratic. Earlier, South Asian countries, barring India and Sri Lanka, had been under military rule periodically (like Pakistan and Bangladesh) or under a monarchy (Bhutan and Nepal).??
?And thanks to growing prosperity and democratization, South Asia is now witnessing greater empowerment of its peoples, though many issues and challenges are yet to be solved or met adequately, ? Dr.Singh said.?
The economic, political and social changes brought about by empowerment have created a vast market for goods and services, making South Asia a region attractive for outsiders with wares to sell, services to provide and money to invest.
Inter-Connectivity?
The? demand for trade necessitates inter-connectivity. Therefore, inter-connectivity is the buzzword now with many international structures being set up to work on it, such as the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Economic and Technical Cooperation (BIMSTEC).?
? ??
The region is also being considered relatively safe for investment. ?The fear of an India-Pakistan showdown ending up in a nuclear war in the subcontinent has all, but disappeared. In fact, the focus is no longer on the India-Pakistan conflict, but on the increasing competition between India and China in the economic and strategic spheres,? Dr.Singh pointed out.
Turning away from the India-Pakistan conflict, the Western world? is now envisaging a role for Pakistan in the peace process in Afghanistan. Given the already existing Indian outreach in Afghanistan and China?s growing interest in that country, China? now wants India to jointly execute development projects there.
Terrorism??
Bur there is one nightmarish problem facing South Asia, and that is the scourge of terrorism, both domestic and cross-border. Therefore, in contrast to the past, the focus now is on terrorism and cross-border terrorism.?
?Afghanistan and Pakistan are seen as breeding grounds of terrorism,? Dr.Singh noted.?
In 2010, the US had imposed sanctions on the financial and support networks of Pakistan-based Lashkar-e Taiba (LeT) and Jaish-e Mohammed (JeM). The UN Security Council has been wanting to declare the JeM leader, Masood Azhar, as a ?global terrorist? but China has been putting a spoke in the wheel to help out its ?all-weather friend? Pakistan. Beijing?s plea is that the demand for the ban does not follow the UNSC?s requirements.??
The LeT, with links to Osama bin Laden and the Al-Qaeda network, had already been designated as a ?foreign terrorist organization? in December 2001.??
?Terrorism is a big issue in the world today. But the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) had foreseen it way back in 1987 when it signed a Regional Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism. Taking the lead, India had proposed? a UN Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism in 1996,? Prof. Singh recalled.??
But deeply concerned about the lack of progress in suppressing terrorism, India?s Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been giving top priority to the subject in his dealings with other countries. He has told Pakistan in no uncertain terms that terrorism and talks cannot go together. This was reiterated when the present Pakistani Prime Minister, Imran Khan, made an offer to hold talks with India on all outstanding issues, Dr. Singh pointed out.?
Asked if the conflict with Pakistan on the issue of cross border terrorism is not hampering cooperation through an established institution like SAARC, Dr. Singh said that India is circumventing this problem by building other networks where Pakistan is not involved, such as BIMSTEC.?
?After the BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa) summit in Goa in 2016, Prime Minister Modi organized a BRICS-BIMSTEC outreach summit there. At that summit attended by Bangladesh, India, Myanmar, Thailand, Bhutan, Nepal and Sri Lanka, combating terrorism was given high importance, though BIMSTC had nothing to do with terrorism per se.?
The first BIMSTEC military exercise was held in Pune in September 2018.All member countries barring Nepal and Thailand, sent their teams. Apparently, China had dissuaded Nepal from participating, Dr. Singh said.
China?s entry
As an expert on China, Dr. Singh said that China?s entry into South Asia is a major new factor. In his view, China?s? engagement with the region is ?continuous, enormous and influential.???
He pointed out that out of the six major projects in China?s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), four are in South Asia. China is also present in the Bangladesh, China, India, Myanmar Forum (BCIM). However, to date, China?s flagship project in the region is the China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). China has ports in Sri Lanka and Pakistan and is planning one in Myanmar. A China-India-Nepal-Corridor on the anvil. ?Through these corridors, China will have a 1.5 billion strong market,? Dr. Singh pointed out.?
Checkbook? Diplomacy
It was during the 1997 world financial crisis, that China came up with the idea of extending its economic and strategic influence overseas through ?checkbook? diplomacy, Dr. Singh said. ? When the US dithered at that time, China became pro-active.?
According to Dr. Singh, China?s interests are at once economic and strategic. China?s strategy is to try and get recipient countries into a debt trap so that they will, over time, surrender their assets in lieu of repaying loans, he said.??
Dr.Singh questioned the veracity of China?s claim that a good part of its loans is given at a very low rate of interest and some of the money is given as a grant. The initial jacking up of the cost of the project nullifies the effect of giving a part of the loan at a low rate of interest. And under the counter payments to influential local parties facilitate the acceptance of such deals, Dr. Singh observed.
?Extraction and usurpation are the twin aims of the BRI,? he added.?
Sovereignty
?
India?s opposition to the China-funded CPEC in Pakistan is based on the ground that a part of the corridor passes through a part of Kashmir which India considers its legal entitlement.
The Indian scholar said that China has no right to point an accusing finger at India in this regard as China had successfully prevented the Asian Development Bank from investing in the Indian State of Arunachal Pradesh arguing that this State is part its Tibet Autonomous Region.?
?I tell the Chinese: Apply your own principle to India?s objection to CPEC, then you will appreciate New Delhi?s stand,? Dr. Singh said.?
Explaining India?s objection to China?s ring of ports around it? Dr. Singh said that India feels vulnerable because these ports have a dual purpose. However, China?s main aim is not to intimidate India as such but to checkmate the United States.
Objection Restricted TO CPEC
However, India?s objection to BRI is restricted to CPEC, Dr. Singh said. India?s attitude towards BRI softened when Chinese President Xi Jinping proposed that India is welcome to take up joint projects with China in third countries. There is already a proposal for India and China to jointly engage in development projects in war torn Afghanistan.?
Therefore, in the midst of conflicts, India and China are exploring spaces for cooperation. There is already cooperation between the Indian and Chinese navies in anti-piracy operations in the Gulf of Aden and off the Somalian coast, Dr.Singh pointed out.

Away in a Manger
	
?
It was the night of Christmas. All was calm, all was bright, as the perennial hymn has it. But all was not bright in the Perera family with their five year old struck down by a terminal illness. His time too was running out, as time was running out for the current year, but prematurely. His doctors had fore-warned his condition and so he was sent home for Christmas.? ?
The parents had spruced up the house better than other years as their now meagre finances permitted. They knew he wouldn?t have another Christmas and so they did their best to make things bright for him. The Christmas Tree was installed in his room, all lit up, at which he gazed with the never-ending wonderment of the child. ?Christmas Tree! Oh Christmas Tree! .... ?.?
?
His 8-year-old sister kept vigil at his bed-side crooning his favourite Christmas carol, now in Sinhala, now in English. ?Long time ago in Bethlehem. So the Holy Bible says ....? In the drawing room, the radio was wafting the strains of ?This comes to pass when a child is born...??
?
The boy brightened and lifted himself ever so slightly as his enfeebled body permitted. A smile strayed on to his wan face. They went to a front pew close to the stable. Very kindly some people moved out to accommodate them. But the boy insisted on lying on the floor close to the stable
?
But this child would soon be gone pondered the mother as the tears rolled down her cheeks. How soon she could not envisage. However she went on with her preparations to make the day as wonderful as possible for the child. The boy was restful that day and murmured to the mother that he would like to attend the mid-night mass, the church being close by. He wanted to hear the singing in the church and see the crib there. The parents were distraught. He was too weak to be moved about. But he pleaded ?Please amma! Please thattha!? The father attempted to appease him. ?You see, Santa will come tonight. I will stay with you. Let amma and akka go for the service? ?But I want to see the infant Jesus in the stable, not Santa. I am too tired for Santa but baby Jesus will be sleeping in the stable and I want to sleep with him.?? ?
The parents could not help but yield to his pleading against their better judgement. After all it was his ardent wish; at this stage of his illness there was nothing to gain or lose. So wrapping him in the warmest, most comfortable clothing they took him to church.?
The father and mother taking turns to carry him in their arms with the little girl in a pretty Christmas frock tagging on clinging to one or the other.? ?
The night was calm; the night was bright. The boy gazed at the stars in the night sky in the arms of his mother or father in turn, murmuring from time to time - enthralled. They reached the church. Oh! how it was lit up and decorated! The boy brightened and lifted himself ever so slightly as his enfeebled body permitted. A smile strayed on to his wan face. They went to a front pew close to the stable. Very kindly some people moved out to accommodate them.?
But the boy insisted on lying on the floor close to the stable. The parents were flustered but complied. They sat on the floor, the mother cradling the child on her lap. He lay there peacefully; as peacefully as the babe in the crib lulled by the strains of the carol ??Away in a Manger.????
Be near me Lord Jesus I ask you to stay;? ?
Close by me forever and love me I pray;? ?
Bless all the dear children in thy tender care;??
And fit us for heaven to live with thee there.? ?
The mother gently left him with the sister and went up to receive communion when the time came. When she quickly returned she could not spot the child. She panicked momentarily and looked about. He had crept on to the spacious stable and lay in a long, long, deep, peaceful sleep on the straw, a smile hovering about his lips, while the soft cadence of the perennial carol filled the midnight air.? ?
...All is calm, all is bright? ?
Round yon virgin mother and child? ?
Holy infant so tender and mild? ?
Sleep in heavenly peace? ?
Sleep in heavenly peace...? ?

Christmas in Context
	
Multi-religious Sri Lanka celebrates once again the great historical festival of Christmas commemorating the birth of Jesus Christ, the founder of Christianity. It has become over the centuries an international pageant of joy and glitter with people across the globe keeping it in an amazing cultural diversity and social traditions. It must be remembered that Christmas is a profoundly religious celebration since according to Christian belief, it is a commemoration of the Birth of Christ who is the full revelation of God and the one and only historical incarnation of divinity and the Redeemer of the human race.??
The message and meaning of Christmas is simple. It is God?s love manifested in a truly human being identified as Jesus of Nazareth, the eternal Galilean. Christian faith sees in his face, the countenance of God himself and in his words and actions the intervention of the divinity. In the life-events of Jesus, namely his birth, preaching, miracles, suffering, death and Resurrection, God had revealed his immense and immeasurable kindness and compassion to human beings. To bring back the lost honor and dignity to human beings, he himself became a human being and lived deeply profound human experiences including suffering and death. According to a poet, Christ is God?s love written in human language.?
According to spiritual writers, his was the greatest life ever lived and the greatest story ever told. He lived and worked as an itinerant preacher, going about doing good, declaring the advent of the Kingdom of God, cleaning up false practices of religion, bringing in a religion of the heart, healing the sick, driving out evil spirits and even resurrecting the dead. He declared himself a king before the Roman Governor Pontius Pilate but made it clear to him and to the people that his kingdom was not of this world. He had come for this purpose to bear witness to the Truth and that those who are of the Truth hear his voice and hearken to his call. The Roman governor for all his intelligence and power, did not seem to know what is the Truth.? ?

CHRISTMAS MESSAGE OF CATHOLIC BISHOPS? CONFERENCE - 2018  God revealed His depth of abounding love f
	
Christmas is the celebration of the birth of Jesus in Bethlehem which is God?s loving entry into human history. In this mystery of the Incarnation God revealed to us the depths of his abounding love for humankind. ?God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son so that whosoever believes in him may not perish but may have eternal life? (John 3: 16).? ?
By his coming into our World he wants us to share in the fullness of life which he alone can give (John 10/10). Thus, Jesus accompanies us and dwells with us. The name given to Jesus is Emmanuel, which means ?God with us?. Hence, our celebration of Christmas cannot and should not be a mere recalling of a past event. It is an occasion to understand more deeply the real value of life and to witness to its fullness in the society we live.? ?
Christmas therefore reminds us of the need to invite Jesus into our lives, our families and our society. This seemingly simple birth in a stable in Bethlehem is a universal call towards conversion so that we would be more sensitive to the needs of others irrespective of various differences. Although Christmas is a joyful season, we need to be careful not to make it merely an external celebration. The true and inner joy of Christmas comes from a conversion of heart and accepting Jesus as the Lord and Savior of our lives.? ?
While we engage in various forms of charitable activities during Christmas we also have a duty to be more sensitive to the human needs and sufferings prevailing in our country.?
As Jesus was born among the poor Christmas invites us to pay careful attention to the poor and be sensitive to the various forms of human needs and sufferings prevailing in our society. The question of poverty can be alleviated only by creating just economic structures. True development of the human beings can happen only in a society where there is mutual respect, justice and peace. A sincere commitment of everyone is needed in creating this environment in our country.? ?
Let us commit ourselves to change all that is not in keeping with God?s holy will in our midst by becoming agents of peace, harmony and reconciliation by forgetting the petty differences which hinder the common good. As we give thanks to God for the beautiful gift of Jesus, let us pray that all of us will be renewed by the Spirit to be His living witnesses.? ?
We wish all our Faithful, our fellow citizens and all men and women of goodwill a Blessed Christmas!? ?

?The advertising machine tells us we have to exchange more and more new presents to give us a surprise. But is that the sort of celebration that God wants?? Pope Francis asked.? ?
?No, Christmas is about listening to the silent voice of God,? he said.? ?
He added: ?To welcome the Savior there are no powerful people, no ambassadors, just simple shepherds, surprised by the angels while working at night.? ?
?Please, I ask you, let us not turn Christmas into a fashionable event!? ?

## Title: Drop in tourist arrivals

Drop in tourist arrivals
	
A German investor, domiciled in Sri Lanka, said the Western Foreign Missions, led by German Embassy and the British High Commission, took Sri Lanka?s constitutional crisis as a reason to issue travel advisories against Sri Lanka, and it was the reason for a drop in tourist arrivals during the season.
Dietmar Doering, who is also a social scientist living in the country said that December, with its Christmas season, is the prime high season for Sri Lanka?s tourism. ?During this period, the entire Sri Lankan hospitality sector looks forward to generating the most significant revenues of the year.
Last year, the entire hospitality sector enjoyed the arrival of large numbers of visitors from all over the world. Most of the hotels and guesthouses had a near 100% occupancy, which was vital, since the six months off-season marks tough challenges to all tourism-related businesses where overheads sometimes cannot be met, resulting in hotel and guesthouses closing down during the months of May to November" he said.?
He said the month of December in 2018 would go down in Sri Lanka?s history as one of the worst drops of tourist arrivals. The foreign offices of these western governments issued the caution notice for Sri Lanka by publicizing these warnings on their websites which in return triggered all major tour operators to issue the publication of the Sri Lanka caution notice to all their travel agency outlets.
In fact, these tour operators for legal reasons are strictly obliged to follow their government?s warning notices and to avoid eventual legal claims from tourists who had not been informed prior to their journeys and who might have been victimized, however. As a hotelier, he quoted from two university students from Germany - Jennifer Schmidt and Alisa Karl - visited many parts of Sri Lanka during their December holidays.?
?Prior to their departure to Sri Lanka, some of their relatives and friends in Germany expressed concerns in view of the German Government?s warning about Sri Lanka. The warning notice includes to urgently avoid public gatherings in general and not to come close to venues where political assemblies happen.
The two young Germans learned by communicating with owners and managers of guesthouses and hotels they visited, that these businesses faced a severe drop in occupancy for over 50%.
The reason for the drop was explained to the two Germans relating to government problems in the last couple of months. However, the German tourists enjoyed a completely trouble free, very memorable holiday in Sri Lanka and stated that the German Embassy?s view of the situation in Sri Lanka is by far not the reality.
Unfortunately, Germans in Germany will find it difficult to judge the real situation in Sri Lanka and have to refer to the false information given by the German Foreign Office which is based on inputs given by the German mission in Sri Lanka?.
On a second perspective, the real cause of the stark drop of tourist arrivals in fact was not the constitutional problems which Sri Lanka faced during the last months, but moreover the misrepresentation from foreign missions in Sri Lanka to their respective western governments. Noticing the German Embassy?s travel advice, that it warns people not to generally not come near public gatherings, assuming the dangers of being hurt does not reflect at all the factual ground situations of the past few months. Even during the constitutional crisis, which at the end found a very democratic and peaceful solution, not a single foreigner had been attacked, hurt or otherwise antagonized - even if they had been near, or even among, the demonstrating different fractions.
The demonstrating parties engaged in largely peaceful demonstrations and none of the parties involved targeted foreigners. The German warning notice is irresponsibly inflated and had caused massive negative impacts to the Sri Lankan tourism industry in general. In fact, the United Kingdom travel warning further advises that ?terror attacks in Sri Lanka cannot be ruled out? which indicates a groundbreaking lack of knowledge and judgement of the real situation in Sri Lanka. For the last 10 years no terror attack had been noticed and especially no foreigner had been found victimized through an attack of this nature,? he said.

Historic judgement to political impasse -  The glorious star shone over SL
	
?
The star that shone over Bethlehem when Christ was born came to us in the prelude to Christmas, inspiring an independent judiciary whose historic judgement has brought them accolades from all over the world.?
All of us who prayed unceasingly through day and night, ever since that blackest of Fridays on October 26, have to thank God Almighty for yet another miracle. We also owe a debt of deep gratitude to our panel of Judges who stood firm and unwavering in their unanimous judgement and to civil society who played their part stronger than they ever had before,in their steadfast, courageous stand on this issue which badly affected the country as a whole. It was a clear stand for democracy, for what is right and not for who is right.? ?
This has been a lesson, although bitterly learned at the expense of the country and the people. It should be clear to one and all that the executive Presidency must go, the sooner the better. We cannot allow personal vendetta?s stemming from the whims and fancies of one individual to hold the country to ransom. I quoted two political Giants of the past, the late Dudley Senanayake and the late Dr. Colvin R. de Silva in a previous article on this issue. I didn?t know then that when the late Colvin warned the late President Jayawardene about what would happen if the wrong man was elected executive President, JR had said ?Que Sera sera? which means ?whatever will be, will be?. Colvin?s riposte had been.? No Dicky, whatever I say will be?.
?
We also owe a debt of deep gratitude to our panel of Judges who stood firm and unwavering in their unanimous judgement and to civil society who played their part stronger than they ever had before,in their steadfast, courageous stand on this issue which badly affected the country as a whole
This prediction has now come to pass so many years after their deaths. We also have to thank the international community, for taking the stand they did in not recognizing the illegal government, for warning tourists not to come here, for holding back aid and investment.It?s all very well for some who think they know everything to comment that there should be no interference from foreign powers. But the truth of the matter is that countries like ours cannot exist on our own, we need aid, we need investment and we need tourism. In these circumstances,the international communities, particularly those who believe in democracy, have every right to say what they feel and act accordingly.? ?
By removing the rightfully elected Prime Minister who was elected in keeping with the constitution, without whose help and support, he would never have been elected President and venting his venom against him time and time again in an undignified manner, for one in his position, the President has only helped Ranil to create another record. Previously, he and late Dudley, both shared the honour of being Prime Minister four times. Now Ranil has beaten this record and become PM for the fifth time.? ?
Even Ranil?s most vociferous critics must admit that no-one but he, could have handled and got over this crisis as he did with two cunning politicians as his protagonists. He never slandered his slanderers back, never lost his cool, remained calm and collected through the traumatic experience in which he was the chief victim. He was targeted with the vilest of abuse, but never even lost his sense of humour, which I was once the victim of in the midst of the crisis! This is a mark of greatness, Ranil Wickremesinghe as a man and as a politician is the genuine article, made of stuff which cannot be bought. These qualities of self control and self discipline have been instilled in him from childhood. His long experience as a lawyer, working under a great name in that field of that time,the late H.W. Jayewardene, his working closely with JR and the late President Premadasa in politics to whom he was very loyal, when others broke away, was when he gained experience in governance, his being widely read on a wide spectrum of subjects, ranging from history, politics, literature, music, has given him a wider dimension on issues which few other politicians today possess. He always remained loyal to the party,led it through the worst times.?
?
We must thank the international community, for taking the stand for not recognizing the illegal government
	Ranil, as a man and as a politician is the genuine article, made of stuff which cannot be bought
	He never slandered his slanderers back, never lost his cool, remained calm and collected through the traumatic experience in which he was the chief victim
?
Insiders say he was able to go through every aspect of the recent case, advise the lawyers, although he has never taken any credit but thanked instead, all those who stood for firmly and fought for democracy. Another fact I must mention, although I may get the sharp end of his tongue for doing so, is that when it was decided to give a gift of cash of Rs. One million to late Lester James Pieris. The government said it could give half the amount. He gave the remaining Rs. 500,000 from his personal savings account. I cannot think of any other politician who would have done this. He is a forgiving person and has always forgiven and even rewarded those who have stabbed him in the back.?
This I think stems from his childhood, he comes from a home where one parent was a Buddhist while the other a christian. He is a Buddhist like his mother, is well read on Buddhism and has always been a devout Buddhist, but he is influenced to a certain extent in his thinking by Christianity too.?
The myth spread by enemies of his unpopularity was proved a lie at the last election when he polled 500,000 votes, the largest ever in that election. There is in his reaction to the slander thrown at him a similarity to Christ?s word on the cross.?

Human Rights Arts 2018 ARTISTS RESPOND  to anarchy
	
?
Recognising World Human Rights day celebrated on December 10, four contemporary artistes joined forces to respond to the current political travesty raging the nation.? Presenting both their own creative take on this chaos and a platform for voices of resistance to rise up, Chandragupta Thenuwara, Senaka Weeraman, David Cotterrell and Ruwanthie de Chickera held? ?Human Rights Arts 2018? from December 10 to 15 at the JDA Perera Gallery marking its second year.
The venture?s circulars pictured the faces of President Maithripala Sirisena, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and former President Mahinda Rajapaksa morphing into one; a statement of impartiality and equal compromise. The showcase placed sensitive issues in bold new light and was profound evidence that violence and uproar aren?t the only means to make a stand.?
Walking into the ground floor, one first encountered the works of Chandragupta Thenuwara; President of the Arts Council of Sri Lanka and Senaka Weeraman, a local architect based in London.
In an attempt to address the misinterpretation of the Constitution concerning its translations, Thenuwara had reprinted the document in English, Sinhala and Tamil and spanned them across the wall one below the other.? ?For some reason, the same content ends up having to take a lot more words to explain,? Cotterrell mentioned gesturing to the length disparity of the translations.
?
?Amidst the cacophony of contradiction, one may come to realize that ?depending on where you stand you have a different understanding of what this picture means.??
Weeraman also followed the tri-lingual theme in his artwork proclaiming the words ?Democracy + Justice? employing a unison of red, blue and green colours.??
Installation artist and director David Cotterrell together with playwright and theatre director Ruwanthie de Chickera tackled the Constitutional issue somewhat differently. The work titled, ?Capital C for Constitution? playfully responded to the recent debate over the meaning of clauses of the constitution. As both parties involved presented their mandate claiming constitutional evidence, this piece delivered that subtle differences in the Sinhala and English versions might serve to have profound consequences. A computer administered by an unseen entity used Google to translate the document between the three languages. The process continued, the small flaws in the automatic translation began to take effect, until finally the absent operator inserted the selection back into the official document when it was no longer perceived as a threat. Cotterrell explained that they were trying to ?highlight the possibility of error, the possibility of?making mistakes.?
?
Another thought provoking piece by this pair who have been around the world collaborating for the past three years, was titled ?Was Many pictures.? This incorporated six lecterns which surrounded a single monochrome photograph capturing the moment former president Mahinda Rajapaksa signed his acceptance of the Prime Ministerial office. This iconic image that was plastered all over media and broadcast for the world to see was always accompanied by an opinion, quote; a caption of some sort, until now. Here, the artists invited the viewers to observe the image in silence, unrestricted by a framework of an outsider?s thoughts. One might then approach the six lecterns containing a catalogue of audio clips extracted from reprinted stories within the Daily Mirror. Random, unrelated and even contradictory statements and reports of the capture would then be read out by actors.? Amidst the cacophony of contradiction, one may come to realize that ?depending on where you stand you have a different understanding of what this picture means.? Referring to the piece, its creators explained, ?It seems we share the same pictures but not the same narratives.? In fact, in spite of us sharing the same pictures, and even forming our narratives through common pictures, it?s entirely possible that we inhabit parallel realities, comprising parallel memories and building on parallel imagined futures.? Many pictures became one picture because we realized one picture could literally hold the hopes and fears of an entire country.
?political ?heroes?
Amidst the artistic statements made in connection to the ongoing political crisis, there were also references to Sri Lanka?s history of war, turmoil and chaos. Chandragupta Thenuwara?s ?Fallen Heroes after October 26 (2018), Black Friday;?pointed to a mould used to sculpt a monument now split at its core. Deceptively simple in appearance, the work delivered a message of broken and hollow ideals of heroism. It described how political ?heroes? are now exposed, humiliated and made immaterial before the eyes of the masses that once placed them on pedestals. Having previously launched his series on ?barralism? which provided a creative outlook on the concrete barricades behind which soldiers stood during the time of war, Thenuwara?s ?Neo-barralism Strikes back? served as a reminder of how barrels and barricades have existed and have weakened since, trying to suppress chaos from breaking free. A similar line of thought was seen through his piece ?Files and Camouflage,? where a stack of filed human rights violation cases were mingled with scraps of? camouflage material, expressing a concealed, yet always present interference?with the system.?
Capturing the attention of crowds both online and at its unveiling was David Cotterrel and Ruwanthie de Chickera?s ?Just-Ice?- a six-foot tall ice sculpture of the Parliament building. The ambitious yet successful structure was constructed twice; once at the Independence square and then again for the opening day of the exhibition.
Cotterrell described their adventurous reveal at the independence square, where they observed its effect on the masses. Some took selfies, protest groups used it to support their causes, children wanted to touch it, it caused quite the stir, he explained. And all the while, the carving was melting-implicatively from within.
?Parliament took a long time to dissolve.? People kept vigil.? Some lit candles.? Some sang songs.? But there was a sense that the inevitable was happening.? Parliament was collapsing. It seemed to collapse from the inside. There was a gasp from the people watching as the roof of parliament slid off.? Without that shape, it began to look more vulnerable.? Some people had trouble even identifying it as parliament,? the creative pair thus established the powerful message they were attempting to deliver.?
A short time-lapse video which documented the symbolic melt-down was projected at the gallery during the course of the art festival. Ruwanthie added that ironically, the actual Parliament dissolved and collapsed faster than the ice sculpture, which lasted for almost 24 hours at its second unveiling.?
?
Adorning this space were, banners, posters and pictures from various protest campaigns, gleaning like insignia of rebellious battles fought by the people for the people
The upper-most floor of the exhibition was made open for anyone who needed a platform to have their voice heard.?
Adorning this space were, banners, posters and pictures from various protest campaigns, gleaning like insignia of rebellious battles fought by the people for the people. Decking the upper pillars was the momentous sari cloth proudly worn at the recent womens? Protest and draped over a railing was the emblematic rainbow- flag carried by the LGBTIQ community of Sri Lanka in their recent campaign. A wall for the protests of the families of the disappeared, a section for the anti-torture movement, a platform for social media awareness and posters of the butterfly protestors filled up the premise. In this manner, completely unrelated and otherwise disconnected causes were allowed to claim their ground within a single space.?
?The important thing is, this is going to be a regular thing every year, to encourage people to think about raising questions about politics, to make people have a debate and discuss...the whole point is to look at the system,? David Cotterrell expressed the intent driving this venture.?
??Human Rights Arts? initiated in 2017 by Chandragupta Thenuwara primarily focuses on two specific articles of the Universal declaration of Human Rights.?
Article 8 ?Everyone has the right to an effective remedy by the competent national tribunals for acts violating the fundamental rights granted him by the constitution or by law?
Article 21 ?Everyone has the right to take part in the government of his country?
It is in acknowledgement of these rights that this small but powerful collective of contemporary artists have united to view the national crisis through a new lens to express the unexpressed and to stand up for the fundamental values of humanity.?

Launch rapid damage control programme to flood victims: Prez
	
President Maithripala Sirisena today instructed relevant authorities to launch a rapid damage control and compensation programme to flood affected people who were returning from safety locations in the North while continuing the relief programme.
The President instructed the Northern Province Governor Reginald Cooray to launch a relief programme in coordination with all government institutions in the Kilinochchi and Mulaitive districts to provide food, dry ration, drinking water and sanitary facilities needed for the affected people.
The Presidential Media Division (PMD) said in a statement that compensation amounting to Rs. 250,000 would be paid to renovate damaged houses after estimating the loss.
More than 8000 acres of paddy fields have been inundated by the floods and the government has decided to pay Rs. 40,000 per damaged acre of paddy lands as compensation. More than 60,000 people who have been displaced by the floods have been housed in 37 temporary welfare camps, according to the President's media division.

Maldives seizes Lankan boat carrying shark carcasses
	
A Sri Lankan vessel carrying mostly shark carcasses had been seized by the Maldives for fishing illegally in its waters, the Maldivian media reported today.
According to Avas and Raajje News, the boat named ?Oshadi 1? which is registered in Sri Lanka was caught operating in Maldives? special economic zone outside of Gaafu Dhaal atoll last Wednesday.
Members of the crew were apprehended 42 nautical miles off of Gadhdhoo island and were handed over to the Maldives Police Service.
The Maldives National Defence Force has said a number of shark carcasses were discovered from the vessel.
Brigadier General Ali Zuhair said that the vessel appeared to have been fishing and most of the crew?s one-ton yield was shark.
He also said there was nothing to indicate that the vessel had entered Maldivian waters for any purpose other than fishing adding that there had not been resistance from the crew when the coastguard had seized the boat.
?We found fishing equipment and around a tonne of fish on board the vessel. So we have no reason to believe that the boat had entered Maldivian waters for any purpose other than fishing,? Zuhair said.

?
More deadly tsunamis could strike the Indonesian coastline in the coming days, authorities warn, as the volcano which triggered the weekend?s devastating wave continues to erupt.? ?
The death toll has reached 281 with 843 injured and as emergency services scramble to help while people search for their families in the rubble, they are still in danger as Anak Krakatau continues to erupt.? ?
Speaking at a news conference on the island of Java, National Disaster Management Agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho warned that the risk of more tsunamis wasn?t over. ?Recommendations from Meteorology, Climatology and Geophysical Agency (BMKG) are that people should not carry out activities on the beach and stay away from the coast for a while.? ?
?The potential for a fresh tsunami is still possible because the volcanic eruption of Anak Krakatau continues to occur, potentially triggering tsunami.?? ?
The 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake/tsunami of 26 December, left 227,898 dead in Indonesia.? ?
Today?s tsunami was triggered by volcanic activity but the government warned that the country did not have any early warning system for tsunamis not caused by earthquakes.? ?
A government spokesman said the tsunami was likely to have been caused by an underwater landslide caused by volcanic activity of Mount Anak Krakatau, combined with an unusually high tidal wave because of the full moon.?

Opposition leader Mahinda Rajapaksa today requested the Ministry of Disaster Management and other Ministries concerned to attend to the relief measures in an efficient and timely manner in order to alleviate the sufferings of the people in the flood affected areas.
He said in a statement that in the absence of Provincial administrations in almost all the worst affected areas, the responsibility of managing the relief effort would have to be borne mainly by the line ministries concerned.
?Unprecedented floods have affected the Northern Province and several other parts of the country disrupting the lives of many thousands of people living in those areas. Houses have gone under water and roads have been rendered impassable. It is reported that the President has already issued instructions to the officials in those areas regarding the provision of relief services,? he said.
?We express our regret over the loss of homes and livelihoods due to the floods, the timely provision of compensation by the government will provide a measure of relief to those in distress,? he added.

?Nags? as his family of friends spanning 40 years fondly called him, would have celebrated his 55th birthday on December 26, 2018. Caring and always helpful, he would never talk of his numerous achievements, ?connections? or positions in life. A life lived generously; many whom he encountered loved him dearly. This was amply evident in the unprecedented outpouring of affection and grief expressed on his demise on August 7, this year.? ?
A fastidious man when it came to food, drink and attire, he would famously say that his company?s Broker Cocktail was the most looked forward to event in the Insurance Calendar each year. A thoughtful person, he planned and organized well ahead. Whether it was the Bradby in Kandy, Rock Concerts in Europe, a safari in Kenya, the Rowing Club Christmas party or the gathering at the ?waterhole? at his residence on the Friday of the ?Big Match?, it was meticulously planned. His diary, sent home on his demise, was filled with reminders of birthdays, events or thoughtful gestures. He would rarely forget a birthday. A man with a large heart, he was always on his mobile with his beautiful voice resonating a ?Hello? or a friendly joke only he could make.??
Fondly called ?N?jan? by his cousins-in-law, the ?Puvis? adored him for his thoughtfulness and hospitality. Lately, he looked forward to their gatherings, amused at the repeated narration of their?childhood escapades.??

No agreement yet on contesting polls with SLFP: SLPP
	
The Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) today said it has not yet reached any agreement with the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) to contest future elections together.
President Maithripala Sirisena has reportedly said that the SLFP has decided to contest future elections together with the SLPP.
However, when contacted, SLPP Secretary Sagara Kariyawasam said they have not yet made such as agreement with the SLFP.
?We are open for the formation of a political alliance but no agreement has been reached with anyone as of yet. Once an election is announced, we will start having talks with those interested in forming an alliance. However, whatever the alliance may be, it should be led by the SLPP and should contest under the symbol of lotus bud,? he told the Daily Mirror.
He said their party was not afraid of contesting any election unlike the United National Party (UNP) or the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP).
?It is absurd to note that the committee chaired by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, which was appointed to review the delimitation report, has not met even once to discuss its agenda. This shows their interest in elections. We continue to press the Election Commission to get an election for the Provincial Councils,? Mr. Kariyawasam said.
Meanwhile, he said they are optimistic of people electing the next President from the SLPP. ?The next President will be elected from the SLPP and the next government too will be formed by the SLPP,? he said.
Commenting on their political campaign, Mr.Kariyawasam said they would hold meetings covering 25,000 Grama Seva Divisions across the country in early January next year. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Sajith, Sannasgala and large trees
	
Sannasgala has predicted in his book ?Gemba? that Premadasa would not grow to become an accomplished politician
?
Much is said about Sajith Premadasa that he should be UNP Leader, but questions are raised whether the UNP Deputy Leader is hungry enough to lead the ?Green Party?.?
Some time back there was an offer made to Premadasa to even take up the post of Prime Minister, but he turned it down. Right now the buzz within the UNP is that Premadasa would be UNP?s next Presidential candidate.?
Premadasa has maintained that there is no hesitation on his part to accept any post. However he adds that he wants to do everything the proper way.?
In this context it is interesting to note that Sinhala teacher and author Upul Shantha Sannasgala has predicted in his book ?Gemba? that Premadasa would not grow to become an accomplished politician. Sannasgala writes that Premadasa has made the mistake of focusing on paying tribute to his late father, Ranasinghe Premadasa, on political platforms rather promoting his cause. The book was published in 2014, a year before Mahinda Rajapaksa was ousted from power.?
Demi Gods
Sannagala focuses on Premadasa in the chapter titled ?Fingers were made before folks? where he stresses that small trees don?t have a chance of growing when they are placed under large trees. This is because large trees absorb the nutrients from the soil and also the water, thus denying the smaller trees an opportunity to grow, Sannasgala likens Premadasa to a small tree and his late father to a large tree.?
Sannasgala goes on to write that accomplished leaders or individuals like JR.Jayewardene, SWRD Bandaranaike, Abraham Lincoln, Carl Marx, Charles Darwin and Sigmund Freud, failed to see their sons achieve anything significant in life. He reasons that this is because that these fathers had reached the status of demi gods or in other words had achieved celebrity status hence there was no chance for another from the same family to emulate or better that feat.?
But Sannasgala singles out an offspring in the equation in Namal Rajapaksa who he states is an exception. The author points out that young Namal has not been destroyed despite his father being an individual who is virtually being worshiped in the political scene. Sannasgala writes that whether or not Namal would grow to become a large tree like his dad would be decided upon the education he receives to grow as an individual.?
But here the focus of this article is on Premadasa and not on Namal. Parliamentarian Rohitha Abeygunasekere has critisised Premadasa by saying that though he (Premadasa) likes to be the prime minister, he is afraid to take up the coveted post.? Premadasa has already answered his critics by stating that he will come to power the proper way.?
Premadasa, unlike most other parliamentarians, is educated. He received his education at Royal College Colombo and completed degrees at London School of Economics and the University of London. His education and upbringing have made him a wonderful statesman and an ideal candidate to serve the public. But whether he has the burning ambition to propel himself to be the leader of the country is left to be seen.?
There is one thing in Sri Lankan politics that the UNP has to understand. Politicians like Rajapaksa always made sure to portray themselves as heroes and their opponents as villains. Rajapaksa always focused on portraying opponents like Sarath Fonseka and Ranil Wickremesinghe as something bad that should be eliminated. For those who need a stronger interpretation, Rajapaksa termed them as viruses which needed to be destroyed politically.?
Premadasa and the UNP need to learn the art of making heroes of themselves and naming the opponents as villains. The ?Green Party? which promotes democracy shows no interest in learning the art of making heroes and villains. This all boils down to their lack of skills in doing so.?
Premadasa and the UNP prefer to have a powerful prime minister in Parliament instead of a hero who promotes the executive presidency. This is why the UNP is strong within the parliament, but would be crushed at an election if it has to go in front of the people seeking their mandate.?
There are concerns about whether the UNP?s economic policies would suffocate the downtrodden masses. Former premier Mahinda Rajapaksa has warned that the UNP should be more people friendly when taking economic decisions. Rajapaksa made these comments in parliament when during the debate which was held regarding the ?Vote on Account?. Rajapaksa believes that Sri Lanka can progress economically and defend itself against international and external threats only if there is a single highly empowered leader.?
Premadasa has over the years settled down to play the deputy?s role to Wickremesinghe. There is only talk that Premadasa would be UNP?s next candidate at a future election. Wickremesinghe is yet to confirm this news that?s circulating.?
strengths and weaknesses
Premadasa assumed duties the other day as the Minister of Housing Construction and Cultural Affairs. He is reported to have said that his staff should create a roster so that this would ensure that work continues in this ministry throughout 24 hours of the day. This is because Premadasa wishes to achieve what can be done in 10 years within a short period of 10 months. This is possible if the mindset of government workers can be changed overnight to adopt a healthy work culture where employees work as if they are share holders of a company and not as paid workers.?
We have seen the strengths and weaknesses of Premadasa. His strengths like having wisdom, maturity and the ability to honour dignity are sure to be included in a biography penned about him and titled ?Sajith Premadasa-The People?s Leader like Legacy of Ranasinghe Premadasa?. The book penned by Telli C. Rajaratnam will be launched in January 2019.?
The book again, going by the previews written, suggests that there are going to be chapters dedicated to his late father; a figure who despite not living today, can dwarf him by the very mention of his name.?
Premadasa must take a cue from young Namal regarding his future. He must observe how Namal promotes his cause by speaking the least about his much accomplished dad (Mahinda) and virtually nothing about his uncle Gotabaya who could block his path in politics.

Sri Lanka heads for an uncertain future
	
?
As a year of political upheaval and economic stagnation is winding down, Sri Lanka is entering into an uncertain 2019. Politics is as toxic as it has ever been in recent times. The illwill between President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, expressed in the most overt gesticulations, is bound to overshadow government policy. The public euphoria over the rollback of the Constitutional coup evaporated in no time. Most tellingly, the appointment of corruption-tainted Ravi Karunanayake to the Cabinet effectively gave the middle finger to the saner people, civil society and democracy activists.??
The UNP has so far restrained its temptation to form a farcical ?national government? so as to avoid a restriction set by the Constitution, which under the 19th Amendment set a limit of a 30-member Cabinet of Ministers, unless when there is a national government. An earlier plan to form a national government between the sole member of the SLMC and the UNP was abandoned, fearing a predictable public outrage.??
The UNP is also expected to seek legal opinion over whether the government is entitled to have a 32-member Cabinet (30 plus the president and prime minister) instead of 30. All this is to reward its members in order to keep them satiated, so that they would not be tempted to pole vault to the Opposition. Thus, after the much hype about democracy and the will of the people, Sri Lankan politics is back to its usual ugliness.??
?
The UNP is also expected to seek legal opinion over whether the government is entitled to have a 32-member Cabinet instead of 30
Both main political parties, UNP and SLFP have regularly found themselves at the receiving end of the devastating consequences of J.R Jayawardene?s Machiavellian machinations of Sri Lanka?s political fabric. Jayawardene went to an extreme and shameful length hitherto existent culture of political patronage and bribe and entrenched it in the Sri Lankan political life.? ?
?A bloated Cabinet is one way to extend a network of political patronage. India with 1.2 billion people has 27 Cabinet Ministers, Japan has 20 Cabinet Ministers, Britain has a Prime Minister plus 21 Cabinet Ministers.? ?
Whereas Sri Lanka has a history of rewarding nearly all members in the government with some form of ministerial portfolio so that they would be entitled to the accompanying fringe benefits. Such positions have not enhanced efficiency but eaten into the public coffers. The latest economic data of the 3rd quarter is proof of pervasive economic stagnation.??
The economic growth in the 3rd quarter had slumped to an historic low of 2.9 per cent, against 3.7 per cent of equally mediocre growth in the same quarter of the previous year. So the economy has been in a slow death even before the October 26 trigger of a political crisis. Now, with an aggravated political crisis, and its economic implications in the final quarter of this year, the economy is set to record another below four per cent annual growth for the fourth consecutive year.??
While efforts for economic restructuring might have an impact on low growth numbers, the government?s repeated inability to proactively engage in economic development is the main factor for the sub-par economic performance. Unlike the Rajapaksa regime, which to give the devil its due, played a major role as a catalyst of economic development, which any emerging market economy should do, this government solely relied on market forces. However, market forces did not take their own course of action due to other extraneous factors and the prevailing economic and political uncertainty. All in all, economically speaking, the whole life span of the yahapalanaya government was four lost years for the country.? ?
These adverse economic and political conditions are unlikely to improve in the coming year. If any, they are bound to get worse. The president who is waiting to settle his scores with Mr. Wickremesinghe is likely to obstruct the latter?s economic policies at any given opportunity.??
Similarly, any moves to impeach the president would likely compel him to prorogue Parliament, triggering another political crisis. Personal prejudices between the executive and legislature will hold back the progress of the country, and the government?s economic agenda in the coming year.? The only winner in this equation is Mahinda Rajapaksa. He is ridiculed now for taking power through the backdoor. However, he was the one who could have romped home in an election, if the constitutional coup led to a snap general election.??
He is down, but not out. As the Opposition Leader, he is now more formidable. Post-coup political conditions serve him as well. He is likely to receive presidential patronage, if the courts belatedly launch investigations into allegations of corruption during the Rajapaksa regime. Even the courts will be disinclined to lock horns with the president ever too often.? ?
The only memorable legacy of yahapalanaya will be its role in strengthening the independent institutions in the country. However such institutions can not function in a vacuum. Public discontent over multiplicity of reasons, all of which have roots in the disillusionment over perceived economic stagnation, has unleashed far- reaching political changes from America to Philippines. Sri Lanka is not immune to that.??
The UNP has already failed to capitalize on the popular support it received during the constitutional crisis. It is in the process of squandering much of that political capital.??
?
The only memorable legacy of yahapalanaya will be its role in strengthening the independent institutions in the country
It is also unlikely to make a noticeable improvement in the economy any time soon- or even during the two years of its remainder of the term.??
Political uncertainty will take a toll on economy. Economic stagnation in turn would take a toll on democratic reforms.? ?
The year 2018 was one of political upheaval, sinister machinations, undelivered promises and economic decay. Sadly though, as political and economic factors stand, 2019 is unlikely to be different.? ?

The last warning !
	
Why we need to change our perspective on Climate Change
Scientists of the IPCC assert that in order to retain global warming below 2 degrees, countries must commit to proactive action
	With the most recent data available -- for 2017 and from 1998 to 2017 -- Sri Lanka ranked second in the list of countries worst affected in 2017
	?a Sri Lankan innovator seeks to help the country navigate the roads towards?eco-friendly living with his endeavours
?
The world?s leading climate scientists have sounded the warning call, giving us an ultimatum to change the world. In October this year, we were given 12 years to change; to change the way we think and the way we consume -- simply put, the way we live.?
During these 12 years our goal would be to retain global warming at a maximum of 1.5C, beyond which even half a degree would mean devastating changes -- worsening the risk of adverse weather conditions, such as flash floods, droughts, extreme heat and ultimately poverty for more than millions across the world. Extremes Sri Lanka is all but unacquainted with.
The landmark report by the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) released in October noted that unprecedented changes and commitment were required to preserve earth as we know it. Hot on the heels of the IPCC report came the Global Climate Risk Index for 2019, which analyses the extent to which countries and regions have been affected by impacts of weather related losses. With the most recent data available -- for 2017 and from 1998 to 2017 -- Sri Lanka ranked second in the list of countries worst affected in 2017, while Puerto Rico topped the list.? Reconfirming earlier results of the Climate Risk Index, where Sri Lanka ranked fourth in the 2018, the report exposed that less developed countries are generally more affected than industrialised countries.
Clock is ticking
Prof. Dilanthi Amaratunga, Head of the Global disaster Resilience Centre at the University of Huddersfield notes that climate change is running faster than we think.? She highlights the importance of taking critical action to combat both the changing climate and global warming. ?Adopting the Paris agreement in 2015 by 195 nations was a landmark event. According to Article 2 of this Agreement, the central aim is to strengthen the global response to climate change by keeping the global temperature from rising during this century, and keeping it well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. This also means we must pursue every effort to limit the temperature increase even further to 1.5 degrees Celsius,? Prof. Amaratunga stresses.?
Climate change actions will not merely help reduce global warming, according to Prof. Amaratunga, as it needs ground level actions in order to combat the threat. ?For instance, reforestation which is a key Disaster Risk Reduction measure, can be done with the engagement of communities, to help control local temperatures in the long-run. This will significantly support the reduction in global warming,? she insists. Merging disaster risk reduction measures with climate change adaptation will help expedite the process of combating climate change and global warming, Prof. Amaratunga adds.
Scientists of the IPCC assert that in order to retain global warming below 2 degrees, countries must commit to proactive action, which they state are both affordable and feasible.? Meanwhile the preliminary findings of the Inclusive Wealth Report of 2018 presented by the UN Environment Programme exposed that while overall global wealth is rising, the increase for many countries comes at the expense of environmental assets, such as water, clean air, forests and biodiversity. Sri Lanka is undoubtedly among these countries pursuing development at the cost of great environmental damage.?
?The health of an economy is drawn from the health of the environment,? said Pushpam Kumar, Senior Economic Advisor at UN Environment and coordinator of the report. ?To make the right choices that will keep us on a sustainable path, we have to be able to properly measure our progress.??
The report highlighted that carbon damage as a share of inclusive wealth, produces a stronger effect on small countries because their inclusive wealth tends not to be sufficiently large enough to absorb such shock. It states in absolute terms, carbon damage is relatively large in high-income countries.?
Walking the talk
While industrial giants such as China contribute heavily towards carbon damage, in Sri Lanka it is the transportation sector which chiefly contributes to carbon emissions. As the island experienced sudden post war economic growth, the country?s urban infrastructure is now burdened with disproportionate volumes of motor vehicles as a result.? Daunting as it may be, a Sri Lankan innovator seeks to help the country navigate the roads towards eco-friendly living with his endeavours.??
Sasiranga De Silva, a lecturer at the University of Moratuwa, invented an electric conversion kit for trishaws or tuk-tuks. ?It?s basically to convert the existing power-train and install an electric motor and lithium battery pack,? De Silva elucidates.? Together with his team De Silva has been developing an affordable conversion kit that will allow tuk-tuk drivers to convert their vehicles to an electric power-train that will generate zero tailpipe emissions.Asked of the idea behind his innovation, De Silva explains that it is one of the most sensible approaches to limit carbon emissions in the country. With more than 300,000 tuk-tuks on the streets of Colombo alone, De Silva?s approach does seem to have taken the correct direction. ?The transport sector is what contributes to emissions significantly. We have the capacity to do a lot more to improve this situation. Even though the government restricted the import of two-stroke tuk-tuks citing their low efficiency, more than 300,000 such vehicles operate on our roads. My objective was to find a solution to the pollution caused by these vehicles without endangering the income obtained by these trishaw drivers, upon which many families rely on.?? He adds that there exists several other companies which have been developing green solutions for vehicles, some even developing hybrid conversions kits.?
De Silva is now fine tuning invention together with his team. ?We haven?t done any road testing so far and it has only been tested inside the university premises. Until safety is assured and the performance range has been evaluated we won?t be putting it out on the roads,? De Silva discloses.
Asked of the challenges in introducing his solution to Sri Lanka, the young innovator notes that the challenge lies not in the manufacturing of this retrofitting kit but getting through the hurdles of taxation.? ?Battery cells, mechanical components and motors are subject to considerably high taxes. Therefore sometimes we?re unable to afford the conversion since there is no subsidy or concession. A brand new tuk-tuk will cost approximately Rs. 700,000.? The cost benefits of running the vehicle with electricity would be around Rs. 300,000 to 400, 000.? Yet the problem is that the lithium ion battery is very costly and sometimes the conversion cost would cost as much as a new trishaw,? De Silva stresses. ?Therefore the real challenge is to maintain the cost at a reasonable rate.??
Meanwhile De Silva is currently testing the conversion kit?s ability to afford the same range of distance covered by fuel. ?Since there are not many charging stations in Sri Lanka, drivers would have to bring their vehicle home to recharge. Therefore we have to be able to give them the same range of at least 100 km,? points De Silva. According to a survey conducted by his team, a battery pack can cover a distance of around 100 km to 120 km on an average before the battery has to be? recharged, another aspect of his invention he?s looking into improving.?
In March this year, the UN Environment Programme hosted the Asia-Pacific Low-Carbon Lifestyles Challenge which aims to mobilise and support young people with business ideas on how to foster energy-efficient, low-waste and low-carbon lifestyles. Among the twelve Asian entrepreneurs awarded for forward-thinking environmental solutions was Sasiranga De Silva. ?My submission was selected for the final twelve out of 180 proposals under the Low Carbon Mobility category,? De Silva notes.?
After nearly two weeks of disagreements, the world last week agreed to the Paris Rulebook, a set of rules to help curb global warming. Adopting this agreement at the 2018 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Katowice, Poland was an important moment for climate diplomacy. Especially as vulnerable countries, including small island states such as Sri Lanka who could see entire territories disappear as seas rise, agreed to the text to ensure the rulebook moved forward. However Climate Change is a global phenomenon which can only be overcome by collective effort. While governments have been taking a backseat in the battle against climate change, businesses big and small have been prompt in action.? Perhaps the achievements of young entrepreneurs such as Sasiranga De Silva may serve as a reminder to our own government to rise up to the challenge of delivering faster change.Email: kalaniwrites@gmail.com

Trump forces Mattis out early... names acting defense secretary
	
?
By ? Philip Rucker, Dan Lamothe, Josh Dawsey, (c) 2018, The Washington Post, Dec 24, 2018 -? ?President Donald Trump, who aides said has been seething about news coverage of Defense Secretary Jim Mattis? pointed resignation letter, abruptly announced Sunday that he was removing Mattis two months before his planned departure and installing Patrick Shanahan as acting defense secretary.??
The move brings fresh instability to the Pentagon as it manages Trump?s sudden decisions to withdraw U.S. troops from Syria and Afghanistan. Shanahan, a former Boeing executive who has been Mattis? deputy at the Pentagon, will assume the top job on an acting capacity beginning Jan. 1. But a senior administration official said Trump plans to conduct a wide-ranging search for a permanent replacement and is interested in candidates from outside the administration.??
Trump decided hastily to remove Mattis in reaction to negative news coverage, according to senior administration officials, one of whom said the president was eager to retaliate against Mattis and show up the widely respected former General.? ?
Trump was so angry with Mattis that on Sunday morning he directed Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to inform the defense secretary that he was being removed from office two months early.??
Mattis resigned in protest after Trump announced the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Syria over the strong objections of Mattis and others on the national security team.

UNTO US a SAVIOUR IS BORN
	
When Angel Gabriel announced to Mary that she will bear a son who will be called Jesus, she is surprised and meekly replies that she is already pledged marriage to Joseph and confused over the situation because she is a virgin. Gabriel answers, ?The Holy Spirit will come upon you? and to help Mary accept the message, Gabriel adds ?Look, Elizabeth your relative has also conceived a son in her old age and she is on her sixth month, the so called barren woman.? ?
?Don?t be afraid Mary, God has been gracious to you. You will become pregnant and give birth to a son and you will name him Jesus. He will be great and will be called the Son of the most High God. The Lord God will make him a king as his ancestor David was? - Luke 1, 30 - 33.?
After the angel left, Mary hurried to see Elizabeth in a hill country in Judea and greeted Elizabeth and the baby within her moved at Mary?s voice. Elizabeth too was filled with the Holy Spirit and said in a loud voice ?You are the blessed of all women and blessed is the child you bear. Why should this great thing happen to me that my Lord?s mother comes to visit me?? ?
?
It was time for her to have the baby while they were in Bethlehem. There she gave birth to Jesus and wrapped him in cloth and laid him in a manager as no room was available at the Inn
Mary stayed about three months with Elizabeth and left for home. There was a law at the time that required a census to be taken throughout Rome which made Joseph leave the town of Nazareth to Galilee in the town of Bethlehem in Judea which was the birthplace of King David. Joseph had to go there because he was a descendent of David and took Mary along with him. It was time for her to have the baby while they were in Bethlehem. There she gave birth to Jesus and wrapped him in cloth and laid him in a manger as no room was available at the Inn. That did not worry Mary or Joseph as they looked lovingly at the coming of the Messiah sleeping peacefully surrounded by sheep, cattle and mules in their resting place.? ?
Elsewhere in some part of the country some shepherds were watching over their flock in the open by night. Suddenly an angel appeared to them and the glory of God was with them but the shepherds were terrified. The angel announced ?don?t be a afraid I am here with good news for you which will bring great joy to you. You will find a baby wrapped in strips of cloth and lying in a manger. This very day in David?s Town your Saviour, the son of God is born, Then, there appeared great army of heaven?s angels singing praises?of God.? ?
It was God?s wish that Ceaser Augustus made the registration law so that Jesus would be born in Bethlehem, the hometown of the ancestors of King David. The Scriptures had said before where the promised Ruler would be born.? ?
According to the Gospel of Luke, Jesus is presented as both the promised Saviour of Israel and as the Saviour of all people. He further preached that Jesus called by the Holy Spirit of the Lord and filled with compassion for people with all kind of needs. He announced the coming of Jesus.?
?
Luke further preached that Jesus called by the Holy Spirit of the Lord and filled with compassion for people with all kind of needs. He announced the coming?of Jesus
Joseph and Mary decided to remain in Bethlehem rather than return to Nazereth. The God? Law to Israel commands when a boy is eight days old, he has to be circumcised and a name given on that day. They named their child Jesus as angel Gabriel had said.? ?
Now a month had passed and Jesus is 40 days old. Mary and Joseph take him to the Temple in Jerusalem which is few miles away for her purification because the law commands that a mother is required to present a purification offering to?the temple.? ?
PURIFICATION
?It means when Israelite women gives birth, they are ceremonially considered unclean for some time. A burnt offering as a cleansing sacrifice must offered. It reminds that imperfect sinful life has been passed. The infant Jesus was perfect and holy when he was brought to the temple as required by the Law for purification. Mary does so and as her offering she brings two small birds. This reveals to us their economic situation. According to The Law, a young ram or a bird should be offered but if the mother cannot afford a ram, two doves or two pigeons would suffice. That was Mary?s plight and what she offered.? ?
While at the Temple, Simeon approach as God has revealed to him that before he dies he will see the Messiah. On this day, he was directed to the temple where he finds Joseph and Mary with their sacred son. Simeon takes the baby in his arms and thank God saying ?Now Sovereign Lord, you are letting your slave go in peace according to your declaration.?? ?
Mary and Joseph were amazed at what they heard and saw especially as Anna the 84-year-old prophetess begins to thank God for letting her see Jesus. Everyone at the temple were shocked as the miracle before their eyes, were unfolding.?
?
The star they had seen and followed in the East, travelled ahead of them. Clearly it was no ordinary star but specially provided for them to be directed avoiding Herod
?
Some astrologers from the East in search of baby Jesus while reading astrology in the stars and were able to identify events surrounding people. They saw a special star, brighter than usual and followed it not to Bethlehem but to Jerusalem. When they reached this city, they asked ?Where is the one born King of Jews? We saw his star when we were in the East and we have come to do obeisance to him ?? ?
King Herod of Jerusalem heard about it and was very upset. He consulted the leaders and asked them where Jesus was. He had the astrologers secretly brought to him and they answered in Bethlehem. After the astrologers leave, an amazing event occurred.? ?
The star they had seen and followed in the East, travelled ahead of them. Clearly it was no ordinary star but specially provided for them to be directed avoiding Herod. They had tricked Herod at his own game of trying to find the baby and kill him but Herod ordered all baby boys under two years be put to death.

What does the birth of Christ mean to us today ?
	
?
Today is Christmas Day and is dutifully celebrated the world over, before people go back once again to the lives they were leading before. Can we draw a meaningful lesson from this day on which Christianity?s founder the Lord Jesus Christ was born???
There is a common saying warning people, ?not to judge a book by it?s cover?. Similarly, it is important not to judge any religion by what we see and know of it.?
Christianity, like Buddhism, Hinduism and Islam has a long history and has stood the test of time. Yet we often judge these religions by what the followers of each religion have said and done and continue to say and do. These historical situations cloud the world so much that we lose sight of the founders and what they did and what they stood for. A beautiful story clearly illustrates this point.??
Once in a place of meditation where people rigorously followed a disciplined way of life, a cat that wandered into the prayer hall was a constant distraction. The superior ordered a subordinate to tie the cat before each meditation started.?
This became a practice and soon the members forgot the original reason for tying up the cat. The one who gave the original order passed away and so did those who carried it out. When the cat died, it was replaced by another one as everyone by that time thought that they needed to have a tied cat as an essential part of the ritual. This became a tradition and then a law that they had to follow.??
Therefore, it is important for all religions to go back to the source and the founder. We need to discover in a fresh and new way it?s original message and purpose. The birth of the Lord Jesus Christ known as Christmas is truly a great opportunity to look upon one person who has had such an impact on human history that billions of people identify with His name.??
When we look at the event of his birth, several factors become clear. He did not come from a rich family or a noble one. On the contrary he came from a poor and unimportant one.?
He had no place to be born and was surrounded by animals and all the stench that goes with being born in a cattle shed. Wise men were drawn to him by a new star but the special invitees, as the Bible says, were the shepherds who were the representatives of the poor and the downtrodden.??
Yet what makes the life of the Lord Jesus Christ unique and attractive to us through the millennia? He lived from an internal belief system that made him rise above the common attraction and temptations of human power, riches and the temptations of the flesh.?
This made him attractive to many who were themselves searching for a freedom from the passions of the flesh and for a deeper meaning and purpose to their own lives. Simultaneously he became a threat to those who already held power, pleasure and control in their hands.?
He was put to death for holding on to his inner beliefs and he became even more attractive to the seekers of deeper answers to life. Interestingly, in all founders of major religions, the founders have a similar history of an inner journey that has attracted millions.??
It?s important to ask ourselves where we stand in the light of the life of the Lord Jesus Christ born today. Are we still bogged down in the swamp of human power, pleasure, privileged, high positions? and other vices like lust even as we profess to be committed followers of one religion or another? Are we protectors and defenders of religion with the very weapons of power and lust that destroy it? Let us all return in humility to the roots and foundation of our own faiths and discover the light that can save us, our families and our Nation.? ??

Wishes for the Season
	
?As we are celebrating the joy of Christmas and New Year, it is also important to know and understand the significance of celebrating festivals. It is a fact that Christmas is celebrated as the day of the birth of Jesus Christ into this world, yet it also symbolizes a very deeply significant truth of the spiritual life, birth of Jesus Christ reminds everyone a birth of divinity, the life of Jesus reminds a life of sacrifice and transformation, and His death reminds us a life of immortality.?
Jesus was born at a time when ignorance, superstition, greed, hatred and hypocrisy prevailed upon the land. Purity was forgotten, morality was neglected. Therefore birth of Christ brings a message from God, the Almighty about a world that existed long before the birth of Jesus Christ, a world which was created by God Himself, a world of Truth where there was total purity, peace and happiness experienced by the humanity. On the basis of creation and the nature of world cycle such a world has to be re-established by God Himself with the co-operation of own transformation with heavenly nature. Every festival is a call for finishing the difference of cast, creed, religion, language and nationality with the vision of brotherhood and to live a life of happiness and also to help other creation to live in peace.?
?

Let us come together in bringing up such a world transformation where human beings, animals, plants and nature are in peace and serve each other to their best. Such transformation is only possible when we connect ourselves with the Almighty in His real form of light and might and empower the selves with Godly powers of purity, peace, love, truth and bliss, while worshipping not to forget to become worthy.?
Self-transformation of every one of us with intense spiritual efforts will definitely bring about world transformation. Anger becomes our great enemy to achieve targets, attachment destroys happiness, arrogance parts you from the rest of the world, greed makes life miserable, lust finishes all truth in life? let us strive hard to destroy them in the coming year and be blessed with all happiness in life.?
