Ceylinco Life Ran Daru Charika winners during their visit to the ?Nelum Pokuna? theatre complex earlier this year
Life Insurance leader Ceylinco Life has announced the commencement of the distribution across Sri Lanka, of half a million school timetables for the new academic year.
There is more to these timetables, however, than those given out free by stationery shops when the purchase of new school books begins: each of timetable has a coupon that can win its recipient a place at the third ?Ran Daru Charika? educational tour of Colombo to be conducted by Ceylinco Life in early 2016.
Filling in the Ran Daru Charika coupon will provide an opportunity for thousands of children to compete for 600 seats -- for 300 children, each accompanied by a parent or guardian -- on this tour of the landmarks of Colombo.
Intended for children aged 4 ? 12 years, the 2016 tour will include the ?Diyatha Uyana? Water Park at Battaramulla, the Colombo Harbour, BMICH, Sri Lanka Rupavahini Corporation, the museum and Nelum Pokuna. Meals and refreshments will be provided by Ceylinco Life.?
To participate in the draw for the Ceylinco Life Ran Daru Charika 2016, the coupons on the timetables should be filled in, and returned to the nearest Ceylinco Life branch or sent to the company?s head office. The draw of winners is designed to ensure that every one of Ceylinco Life?s 250 branches will be represented by a child on the tour.?
The cut-off date for sending in completed coupons is 31st January 2016, the company said. ?From the children who do not win a seat on the Ran Daru Charika, Ceylinco Life will select another 800 children for attractive consolation prizes.?
Children travelling from distant areas will be provided transport to and from Colombo and where necessary, overnight accommodation will be arranged.
?The response to the first two Ran Daru Charika events we conducted was extremely encouraging,? Ceylinco Life?s Director/Deputy CEO Thushara Ranasinghe said. ?It may be hard to imagine, but for some children in distant areas, it was their first tour of Colombo. Besides its educational value, the Charika is a lot of fun, and provides an opportunity for children from many diverse parts of the country to meet and interact with one another.?
The market leader in Sri Lanka?s life insurance sector since 2004, Ceylinco Life has more than a million lives covered by active policies. The company is acknowledged as the benchmark for innovation in the local insurance industry for its work in product research and development, customer service, professional development and corporate social responsibility.

Video: CID asked to produce copy of Mervyn's complaint on 'White Van Abduction'
	
The Colombo Chief Magistrate yesterday directed the CID to produce the details on the complaint made by former minister Mervyn Silva to them in January regarding the alleged ?white van? abductions that took place during the time the previous government was in power.
In relation to the Habeas Corpus petitions filled against three alleged abductions reported in the Matakkuliya area in 2011, Mr. Silva was noticed to appear as a witness based on the statement he had made to the CID.
When these cases were taken up for hearing yesterday (11), Senior State Counsel Wasantha Perera, appearing for the defendants, told the Magistrate that the Mr. Silva?s statement to the CID in January will be valid only if it was directly related to these three cases. They therefore maintained that Mr Silva's complaint to the CID would be irrelevant to the case and asked court to stop it form being brought in as evidence.
However, Counsel Nuwan Gopage, appearing on behalf of the petitioners, stated that Mr. Silva was noticed to appear in court on the basis of the circumstantial evidence, which was allowed in Habeas Corpus cases.
Appearing for the former minister, Counsel Prasad Silva told the Magistrate that his client doesn?t have any direct link to these three cases, but would be willing to provide a statement with regards to the ?White Vans? abductions, just as he complained to the CID in January.
Thereafter, the Magistrate directed the CID and State Counsel to first provide court with a copy of the Complaint made by the former minister to the CID. Court also told the Petitioners to test out the CID complaint of Mr. Silva and directed them to request for an order to summon him if needed on the next court date, January 26, 2016.

## Title: HDFC?s Rs.4 bn debenture issue to enhance housing market
## Section: Financial News
## Date: 12 November 2015 06:30 pm
HDFC?s Rs.4 bn debenture issue to enhance housing market
	
		 		 
		 
			
Having had a highly successful maiden debenture issue in October 2013, the nation?s apex housing development truss, Housing Development Finance Corporate Bank (HDFC Bank) embarks on its second debenture issue, maximizing on the upward momentum being experienced in equity and debenture markets currently. ?
HDFC Bank which was initially mooted as a building society in 1984 during an era when the country launched a national housing development drive was transformed into a corporation in year 2000. ?
It gained its specialised banking license for housing in 2003 and it was time for HDFC to begin seeking new horizons. Two years later, HDFC was listed on the Colombo Stock Exchange and in 2011, the prevailing Act was amended to enhance its banking operations, enabling HDFC to augment value to its underlying ethos of being truly ?The Housing Bank?.
In this interview, Chairman R J De Silva and General Manager/CEO Nimal Mamaduwa explained the reasoning for the debenture issue and the overall vision the HDFC Bank is pursuing to ensure that housing becomes accessible across the entire nation, irrespective of geographic, social or economic strata.What?s the reasoning for the debenture issue at this point of time?
CHAIRMAN: ? With the government having initiated the 500,000 housing programme, I feel this falls right into the purview of HDFC Bank, given that we already have the framework and rudiments in place to moot and develop housing for the social segments that this programme is focused on. ?This is a five year programme which is well aligned with the plans we have for this Bank. ?I strongly believe that through this debenture issue and other avenues, we will be able to mobilize funds to be at the forefront of this initiative. ?
GM/CEO: ?Our business model inherently has a mismatch given that we work on long term lending with short term borrowings via customer deposits and inter-bank borrowings. ?It has thus become almost imperative that we obtain funding from alternative channels. Our very first debenture issue was extremely successful and was oversubscribed. This displays the confidence that the market has in us. ? ?Hence the objective of this issue is threefold. ?One, to mobilise/raise medium to long term funds to manage our assets and liability mismatch and associated liquidity risk; secondly, to finance the medium long-term budgeted lending portfolio and minimize the mismatch in funding exposure and thirdly to minimise interest rate risk exposure we are faced with.What are the unique features of this issue?
GM/CEO: ?This year we are venturing into ten year tenors in addition to the five year tenor, the latter in the two tiers of floating and fixed. ? The Ten Year tenor will have a fixed interest at an interest rate of 12 percent, while the Five Year (A) will work on ?AWPLR+1.5 ?percent on the floating rate which makes the annual effective rate 10.78 percent. ?The Five Year (B) posits a fixed interest rate of 10.5 percent. ?The payment frequency for the Five Year tenors will be quarterly and semi-annually, while the Ten Year tenor will have an annual payment frequency. ?What are the advantages an investor would have in subscribing for this issue?
GM/CEO: ?Firstly, this issue has gained a rating of BBB from Fitch Ratings Lanka, a rating which has been deduced from our financial performance as well as the emphasis we have always had in strengthening our triple bottom line. ?Also, we have NDB Investment Bank and Bank of Ceylon as joint managers to the issue, both of which are well reputed entities in the market. ?Another is that debentures are free from taxation and will undoubtedly be a solid investment given that our share price is trading consistently well on the Bourse. ?The Bank?s solid financial foundation and continuous improvement in the last three years and this year is well evidenced in both our quantitative and qualitative performance.How do you intend publicising the issue?
CHAIRMAN: We will be using the regular mass media channels, primarily the print media which is a regulatory requirement and also promoting the issue through our prospectus. ?Our initial provision is Rs 3 billion but we are confident, from what we observed from the over-subscription of our last issue, that we will top the Rs 4 billion mark. ? ?What is your financial performance in the immediate?
GM/CEO: ?Very simply, we have been very consistent with our financial results. ?In the first half of 2015, we recorded an impressive PBT of Rs 388.9 million, notching an improvement from Rs 310.5 million over the corresponding period of 2014. ?Similarly, PAT too showcased a significant increase of 49 percent to stand at Rs 276.2 million. ?All our key performance indicators have shown considerable improvement, whether in interest income which increased to Rs 2,260 million displaying an increase of 6.7 percent, deposit base showing growth of 6.8% to Rs 26.1 billion or the loan book increasing 5.2 percent to Rs 24.6 billion. ?Return On Assets stands at Rs 2.71 percent compared to Rs 2.51 percent as at end December 2014. ?
We have always maintained a stringent compliance milieu in the governance of the Bank which is well evidenced in the multiple awards we have won in the past, including the ACCA Sustainability Reporting Awards. ?Our Tier 1 and Total Capital Adequacy Ratio are well within regulatory requirements at 13.08 percent and 12.29 percent respectively, while our statutory liquid asset ratio too conforms well to the regulatory requirement of 20 percent, which is posted now at 30.6 percent. ? The Bank maintains a very stringent control and monitoring process to ensure that our customers gain the benefit of our partnership, rather than face hurdles in their quest to obtain a roof over their heads. ?Hence, we always emphasize the positive advantages of long term relationships with our stakeholders which is surely an inherent trait in the entirety of our philosophy. ?So what are your strengths?
CHAIRMAN: ?The biggest I would say is our potential. ?Our committed and dynamic team is continuously motivated to break boundaries and seek new horizons. ?The fact that we now have a physical presence of 38 branches via infrastructure, does not preclude us from touching every person in this country, given that we use a large team of field personnel who literally help even the most disadvantaged with our unique service tenet of banking on their doorstep. ?
Using palmtops, we have moved into areas that are severely challenged, sometimes in the farthest geographical areas and even social segments who are challenged to find the time or the mindset to conduct banking operations, making communities bankable and bringing them into the banking system. ?In the macro perspective, making citizens bankable is a social responsibility we must take seriously because this has a permeating impact on the country?s development progress and our ethos of giving everyone with a home, absolute credence. ?
Our business focus is multi-fold. ?We don?t simply assist those who want new homes, but we are very keen on uplifting total lifestyles, whether it?s in purchasing new homes, apartments or refurbishing and renovating existing homes. ?While our primary focus is on the lower and middle income earner, we may also assist other income brackets depending on their requirements. ?Through this debenture issue therefore, our ultimate goal is to gain long term funding so we can be even more active in the housing sector. ?Our portfolio of products and services lends itself to the manifold requirements of the current homeowner given the extension of SME loans, microfinance and even business loans, value adding to our stakeholders? lifestyles and empowering their financial capabilities. ?
HDFC Bank opens its debenture issue on the 16th of November 2015.

The government should make a clear stance promptly on the Colombo Port City project funded by China without sending mixed signals to Chinese Government jeopardizing relationships with the two nations, Former External Affairs Minister Professor G.L. Peiris yesterday said.
He said that 10 months had already passed since the government suspended the project; a move which causes heavy losses in millions of dollars to China daily.
The former minister said though there are some powerful ministers in the government who still say that strong relationship with China is vital for the development of Sri Lanka, the Prime Minister, Finance Minister as well as the Ports and Shipping Minister had made contradictory opinion on the relationships with China.
?The government has no clear-cut stance over the relationship with China or on the Port City. It has suspended the project for over 10 months without a definite decision to either cancel it or to implement it. China is an ally which has always stood by our side defending us and has made an immense contribution in the island?s infrastructure development. But the way the present government treating that country is not acceptable. Today, relationship with China has strained,? he told a news briefing. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Colombo DC refuses to restrain UNP leadership
	
	A request by the Mahiyangana electorate UNP organizer to restrain the UNP leadership from naming members to the vacant position in the Uva Provincial Council was rejected by Colombo District Judge T. D. Gunasekera today.
	The petitioner, Prof. K.P.A. Pradeep Wijewardena said he was voted to the ninth place in the last Uva Provincial Council Election for Badulla District.
	He said the UNP had nominated eight other members respectively from 1 to 8 in the list to various posts in the Uva Provincial Council and told that the UNP leadership was now planning to name those who attained the tenth and eleventh places to the Provincial Council without selecting the petitioner who had obtained the ninth position in the preferential vote list.

Video: President calls for full report from IGP
	
	The government is concerned over the questionable behaviour of MV Avant-Garde just before the raid on it by the Sri Lanka Navy early October and President Maithripala Sirisena has asked Police Chief N.K. Illangakoon to submit a report to him on the whole episode and also on the take over of the Rakna Lanka security firm by the Sri Lanka Navy under its wings, Cabinet spokesman and Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said
	At the special cabinet meeting held on Monday it was decided to instruct the Sri Lanka Navy to take over the responsibility and operations of providing maritime security to ships sailing in the Indian Ocean bordering African Countries with immediate effect, Minister Senaratne told the weekly cabinet news briefing today.
	?The Navy Commander who was present at the cabinet meeting said he was ready to take over the Rakna Lanka security firm under the Sri Lanka Navy as it was run by the Navy in the past. Solicitor General Suhada Ganmlath who was also present at the cabinet meeting said it was the best option,? Minister Senaratne said.
	The Floating Armoury, MV Avant Garde which entered Sri Lankan waters, without prior notification, was seized by the Sri Lanka Navy on October 6.
	The agents of the Ship first said that MV Avant Garde did not carry any weapons other than weapons used by four Sea Marshals boarded in the Ship. But during the inspection that followed after the raid it was found that there were LNGs, T56, S84 and hundreds of other light automatic weapons on board the ship, Minister Senaratne said.
	?The Sri Lanka Navy had been monitoring the movements of the vessel entering Sri Lankan waters but when it sailed near the Maldives Islands, its GPS (Global Monitoring System) had been put off which was highly suspicious," he said.
	Minister Senaratne pointed out that MV Avant Garde had obtained permission to berth at the Colombo Port but it attempted to enter the Galle Harbour. The serial number of 43 weapons had been deleted which was also questionable.
	It was revealed during the preliminary inquiry that former Defence Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa had given ?Blanket Permission? to carry weapons onboard ships belonging to Avant Garde security firm bypassing the normal procedure, he said.
	Minister Senaratne said investigators must find out how weapons of the Sri Lanka Navy used by Rakna Lanka security firm ended up in the hands of Avant Garde security establishment also how some of these weapons came under the possession of a private firm by the name of Seaport Ltd. The normal procedure is to hand over those weapons to armed forces, police or Sea Marshals.
	Minister Senaratne emphasized that all Defence Ministry officials who had connections with the controversy had admiited the entire process was wrong but they were not in a position to say ?no? to Mr. Rajapaksa.
	The Sri Lankan flagged vessel, has been identified by the Sri Lanka Navy as the floating Armoury known as Avant Garde, and says that it has entered the Sri Lankan Territory from Sudan without prior notification. When inquired for the vessel to enter the Galle Harbour, the vessel in response has said it wanted to disembark the sailors and hand over the vessel to the Sri Lanka Navy.
	The Sri Lanka Navy had boarded the vessel on October 6, 114 nautical miles away from the Galle Harbour. The Navy Commander noted that the Navy personnel had discovered 810 illegal firearms. The crew aboard Avant Garde had said the weapons belong to Rakna Arakshaka Lanka. Although a Sri Lankan was listed as the skipper of the vessel, investigations have revealed that a Ukrainian was in fact at the helm of the vessel.
	It was also revealed that 3,473 weapons had been issued to Rakna Arakshaka Lanka by the Sri Lanka Navy but only 89 of them were licensed.
	Responding to a journalist, Minister Senaratne said the inquiry was continuing on the controversy and certain government Ministers would have a tough time when the whole truth was exposed upon the conclusion of the ongoing inquiry. (Sandun A Jayasekera)

Video: President vows to abolish Executive Presidency
	
President Maithripala Sirisena today vowed before the mortal remains of Ven. Maduluwawe Sobitha Thera that he would do everything possible under his command to abolish the Executive Presidency and introduce electoral reforms which the late prelate fought for in the past years.
?
	The cremation of the Ven. Thera (1942 ? 2015) took place under state patronage at the Parliament Grounds in Kotte last afternoon amidst a large gathering of Buddhist monks, Buddhists devotees, religious leaders, devotees of other religions, politicians, diplomats, Buddhist delegates from other Asian Buddhist countries, armed forces personnel and many others.
	President Sirisena addressing the grieving gathering of all walks of life further said the Thera passed away at an unexpected time and before fruition of his wish and expectation of creating a ?just society.
	?Ven Maduluwawe Sobitha Thera devoted his life in the last few years to create a just society and promote the concept of good governance in Sri Lanka without politicizing it and paying little attention to his own well being which ultimately led to the deterioration of his health. The National Movement for a Just Society? he formed to achieve those goals and gave the leadership put the foundation to the mass campaign to bring myself and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe to the present positions and to form the regime of Good Governance of today,? President Sirisena said.
	He recalled how Ven. Sobitha Thera worked tirelessly for the welfare of the Sinhalalese, Tamils and Muslims during the conflict which could be termed as a national service and Yuga Mehewara.
	President Sirisena reiterated his pledge to create a just society, good governance, fully restore the rule of law and strengthen democratic institutions the Ven. Thera wished to establish through his campaigns.
	?The Ven. Thera being a Buddhist monk was completely a different character, who took a different path to create a just and decent society. It was a diversion of the commonly accepted path for Bhikkus. But his struggle itself took the better of his life and made the Thera sick and weak which created shock and sorrow among all of us. The greatest honour we can give Sobitha Thera is by following in the path he showed us and endeavouring to achieve a just society and good governance,? President Sirisena stressed and concluded his speech wishing the supreme bliss of Nirvana to the Thera. (Sandun A. Jayasekera)
