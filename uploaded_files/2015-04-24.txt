Wigneswaran seeks release of Lankans in Premananda case
	
CHENNAI: Chief minister of Sri Lanka's Tamil-majority Northern Province C V Wigneswaran has requested Prime Minister Narendra Modi to release three life convicts in the sensational Swamy Premananda case.
The three -Kamalananda, Balan alias Balendiran and Sathis alias Sathishkumar - were convicted and sentenced along with Premananda for raping 13 girls, including minors, and conspiring to murder an inmate in the godman's ashram near Trichy.
They were sentenced to double life imprisonment, and the punishment was upheld by the Supreme Court in 2005. While Premananda died in Cuddalore prison in 2011, the other three are currently lodged in Puzhal jail in Chennai. All the four were Sri Lankan Tamils.
In his letter, Wigneswaran, a former judge of Sri Lanka's Supreme Court, said Kamalananda and the others were falsely implicated in the case. "Premananda's ashram and its properties have to be maintained. No one is there to take care of them. Please immediately release them as they are innocent," he said. Some senior officials expressed surprise and shock over Wigneswaran questioning the Indian judicial system and describing the convicts as innocent.
Premananda died in 2011 at the age of 59 in due to multiple health problems, including an acute end-stage liver disease. Kamalananda, a close associate of Premananda, Balan and Satish were convicted for abetment in the rape of the girls and the murder of Ravi whose body was buried inside the sprawling ashram at Fathima Nagar near Trichy.
Kamalananda's wife Dr Chandradevi, who was charged with terminating the pregnancies of some of the rape victims, was convicted and sentenced to a 39-month jail term. She completed her prison term and was released on payment of a fine of Rs 30,000. While Kamalananda and Balan are engineering graduates, Satish had completed higher secondary. All of them have completed 16 of the 40 years of their sentence.
Declining to reply to queries emailed to him by TOI, including one on whether it was right to seek the release of the life convicts, Wigneswaran merely admitted to sending an appeal to Narendra Modi for their release. He added that the case history was known to senior advocate Ram Jetmalani, who had defended the convicts.
A Sri Lankan, Premananda had set up the ashram in the 1980s. In 1994, he was charged with raping the 13 inmates, all Sri Lankan Tamils. The case came to light after one of the victims escaped from the ashram. Another victim became pregnant and a DNA test established that Premananda was the culprit. On August 21, 1997, the then Pudukottai district and sessions court judge R Banumathi (now Supreme Court judge) sentenced Premananda to double life imprisonment and a cumulative fine of Rs 66.4 lakh.

Bond issue: JVP wants President to appoint new committee
	
The Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) led ?Voice Against Corruption? had written to President Maithripala Sirisena requesting him to appoint a new committee to look into the controversial bond issue.
Convener of ?Voice against Corruption? Wasantha Samarasinghe told the Daily Mirror that they had requested the President to appoint a committee of experts who knew the subject. ?
He said the report of the earlier committee which investigated into the bond issue could not be accepted as that committee comprised several UNPers.
Also he questioned as to how the Perpetual Treasuries got to know there was a decision by the tender board to allow the bonds to extend up to Rs. 10 billion. He said Perpetual Treasuries may have been aware of this situation. This, he said, could be the reason as to why the said company bided for bonds worth Rs. 3 billion.
Further he said the ?Voice against Corruption? had looked into the possibility of filing action against Central Bank Governor Arjuna Mahendran and the Singaporean law provides provisions to take action against him only if he was found guilty of any offence.
The law therefore says that any Singaporean Citizen could work overseas but could be penalised in Singapore only if he was found guilty of some offence. (YP)

National Movement for Social Justice (NMSJ) Leader Ven. Maduluwawe Sobitha Thera said today parliament should be dissolved and the general election held after enacting the 19th Amendment to the Constitution.
He said what they wanted was not to bring any political party to power but to abolish the executive presidency through the required amendments to the Constitution.
?We are not interested in which party comes to power whether UNP, SLFP or JVP. What we want is to introduce the necessary amendments to the Constitution,? the Thera said.
He requested all MPs to vote for the 19th Amendment and said those who oppose it would be considered as traitors.
?We request the people to take to the streets and urge the 225 MPs to support the 19th Amendment to the Constitution. We will never get such an opportunity in the future and the MPs should not miss out on such an opportunity,? the Thera said.WATCH

India denies hurling petrol bombs by SL Navy
	
The Indian government did not get any complaint against Sri Lankan navy hurling petrol bombs at Indian fishermen, External Affairs State Minister V. K. Singh had informed the Rajya Sabha, the New Indian Express said.
The written reply by the Minister was a direct contradiction of reports in media in Tamil Nadu, which quoted police sources as saying that Lankan naval personnel had tossed petrol bombs on fishermen last month.
?As per records available with the Government, no complaint has been received regarding alleged incident of petrol bomb attack on Indian fishermen by Sri Lankan Navy on March 11, 2015,? Singh said.
He added that whenever reports of any attack were brought to the government?s notice, they had ?consistently taken up the issue with the Government of Sri Lanka to ensure that Sri Lankan authorities acted with restraint and our fishermen were treated in a humane manner.?
Replying to another question, Singh said India had immediately taken up the matter of 54 Indian fishermen who were taken into custody on March 21 by the Lankan navy.
?As a result of the Government?s steadfast efforts, all the fifty four Indian Fishermen were released by the Sri Lankan side and have since then been repatriated to India,? the Minister said.
On the repatriation of boats, Singh noted that 38 boats had been salvaged last month, out of the 87 boats detained by Sri Lanka since June 2014.
?Salvage of 30 more boats will be undertaken by Indian trawler owners in consultation with Government of Sri Lanka,? added the minister. Of the rest, 15 boats were completely damaged and likely to be abandoned, one abandoned by the salvage team and three boats sank at an early stage.

Former president Mahinda Rajapaksa said today the Rajapaksas were not thieves and said they had taken only political decisions.
He expressed these views when he visited his brother Basil who was transferred to Colombo National Hospital (CNH) from the Prisons Hospital to which he was admitted soon after the Kaduwela Magistrate ordered that he and two others be remanded till May 5.
Mr. Rajapaksa said there was no reason to remand Basil because the allegations were over a cabinet decision.
?Various allegations have been levelled against Basil, Gotabaya, Namal, Yoshitha and me. But these allegations have to be proved in Court,? he said.
When asked about the 19th Amendment to the Constitution, Mr. Rajapaksa said he did not see anything that was wrong with it and said he hoped the MPs would approve it in parliament and added that the SLFP had proposed some changes to it.

Tsunami funds: Complaint lodged against MR
	
A complaint has been lodged at the Bribery Commission against former President Mahinda Rajapakse on charges of misappropriating Rs. 82 billion from tsunami funds in 2004 by Deputy Minister of Social Services Ranjan Ramanayake.
Ramanayake alleged the funds were wired to the Rajapaksa Memorial Educational, Cultural and Social Services Foundation.
?There is no difference between the person who snatched a necklace of a girl victimized by the Tsunami and someone who misappropriated Tsunami funds. The only difference is the necklace snatcher had been convicted while others are still roaming freely,? he said. (Vishva Gemunu Priyankara)

We will submit changes to 19A: GL
	
In the wake of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) Central Committee (CC) deciding to support the 19th Amendment on a matter of principle, the party said it would support the enactment of the constitutional amendment subject to the incorporation of certain provisions it had proposed.
SLFP CC member G.L. Peiris told a news conference today that the party would submit these amendments on Monday.
He said the government had sought to prohibit MPs crossing over, but even though political crossovers were unacceptable as a matter of principle, the MPs were entitled to act according to their conscience. ?
Mr. Peiris said such rights cherished in representative democracy, should not be subdued under the iron fist of their political party leaders.
He said that based on a proposal by Mahajana Eksath Peramuna (MEP) Leader Dinesh Gunawardane the opposition would call for the appointment of only MPs to the Constitutional Council instead of outsiders.
Mr. Peiris said the government had sought to reduce the size of the Cabinet to 30 but through the new constitutional amendment, the number could be increased in the event of a national government. He said this was not acceptable to his party.
?Today, we have 77 MPs holding portfolios. We cannot allow that to happen. There cannot be a national government formed by two parties,? Mr. Peiris said. (KB)Pix by Pradeep Pathirana
