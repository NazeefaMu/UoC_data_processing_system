A clown seeking a crown!
	
?
The descendant of Dutugemunu now set to stage a comeback to politics through the Green Party is busy with the spade work to launch a Sangha Balavegaya, they say.
The man had set his heart upon founding this Balavegaya on the advice proffered by someone that he should be a leader of some powerful entity if he is to find a comfortable niche in the Green Party which, by the way, he once turned his back on.
The man is making frequent visits to leading Buddhist temples in Kandy and Colombo these days seeking the blessings of the prelates for his Balavegaya.?
However, he is yet to receive the appointment as a Green party organizer of Tissamaharama which is to be the launching pad for his comeback to national politics, they say.?

A relieving touch through  hands  of ?gold?
	
If a Sri Lankan in Colombo throws a stone at the sky, it would most probably fall on a foot massage parlour. Foot therapy or reflexology is so popular here in the business capital of Sri Lanka. That?s how we can see it from the surface. ??
However, when one considers the therapeutic benefits of such a practice, it?s sad to note that most spas in Colombo cater to satisfy the sensual needs of clients more than promote healing. ?
Dr.Cyril Antony from Wattala has practiced reflexology for many decades in Sri Lanka and has a sizable clientele. Recently the International Council for Reflexologists appointed him as one of the directors of its board. Following a voting procedure, Antony along with Arve Fahlvic (Norway), Sally Kay (UK) and Paula Stone (USA) was appointed as board directors and will serve this council till 2021. ?
According to Dr. Antony, foot therapy is a sub-element of reflexology. In most spas the key requirement to be a therapist is to have a lovely smile and a hourglass figure.
Commenting on the spas that operate in Sri Lanka, Dr. Antony said that most places offer foot therapy. According to Dr. Antony, foot therapy is a sub-element of reflexology. In most spas the key requirement to be a therapist is to have a lovely smile and a hourglass figure. But Dr. Anthony insists that reflexology is a study of the human body and goes beyond satisfying the human senses. ?
According to Dr. Antony, his treatments are based on many methods of alternative medicine. He is qualified in acupuncture, acupressure, Reikei and reflexology. ??
?In reflexology, predetermined points are pressed to relieve pain and stress. Most patients come to me after many unsuccessful attempts at trying Allopathy (Western medicine) as the cure. By that time the condition of patients is chronic and healing rates have reduced,? observed Dr. Cyril. ??
Reflexology literature reveals that this practice helps in cleansing the body of toxins, boosting the immune system, promoting healing and balancing subtle energies. Allopathy however doesn?t recognize these channels of energies within the body which form a deep part of the study of alternative medicine. Western Medicine reviews don?t find sufficient support where reflexology has aided the process of healing within human beings.
??
Dr. Antony isn?t the person to start a campaign to promote reflexology nor is he inclined towards highlighting attempts where Western medicine doctors have failed to cure patients. He accepts a patient who has a history of having received Western medicine with a lot of love and compassion, if directed to him. ??
With Dr. Antony, healing might take time, but the cases are many where cure has come as the end result of a long process more than a miracle taking place. ?There is no take home medicine, so there is the need for patients to make that extra effort to visit the doctor several times,? he said. ??
Dr. Antony receives patients who come from distant places like Chilaw and Ratnapura. Apart from practicing at his clinic in Wattala, he also treats patients at a clinic in Battaramulla. ??
In reflexology, predetermined points in the hands, feet, face and ears are pressed to enhance healing or reduce stress. ??
Like in most medical professions, the presence of quack doctors in alternative medicine has greatly inconvenienced patients. ??
This is why Dr. Antony wants a regulatory body in Sri Lanka so that it can ensure that practitioners of alternative medicine are qualified. ??
Reflexology helps in cleansing the body of toxins, boosting the immune system, promoting healing and balancing subtle energies. Allopathy however doesn?t recognize these channels of energies.?
?We must have provisions to list practitioners and there should be course specific requirements. This feature is lacking in Sri Lanka,? he said. For the record countries like America and most European nations have regulatory bodies to regulate alternative medicine. ??
Almost anybody can receive reflexology treatment. But reflexology practitioners specify that clients have to wait one hour after a meal before receiving treatment. Pregnant mothers are also advised not to receive this type of treatment. ??
Dr. Antony has received an invitation to attend the ICR Destination Reflexology Conference scheduled to be held in Taitung, Chinese Taipei in October this year. He believes the new appointment will help create more awareness on reflexology in the island. He also hopes that this new opportunity will help him reach the full potential in this therapeutic practice. ??
In this era where money making and long hours at work drain your energies and invite you to join the queue at the doctor, Dr.Antony?s reflexology promises an alternative; one press here and another there and you?ll be relieved of stress and will feel like a charged up battery! ? ??

## Title: Electric vehicle charging stations to be regulated

Electric vehicle charging stations to be regulated
	
With the increase in the number of electric vehicles in Sri Lanka, the number of charging stations too has experienced a significant growth. So far, there are over 5500 electric vehicles which could be charged at over 70 charging stations.
Since there?s a higher demand for electric vehicles and charging stations, the government has newfound interest in this sector. Hence, a cabinet paper too has been issued to improve facilities. Playing a bigger role in regulating its procedures is the Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL) that works hand-in-hand with these stakeholders.
The Sri Lanka Electricity Act too will be subject to certain amendments thereby giving more authority to the PUCSL to introduce electricity to vehicles, thus giving a boost to the electric car industry in Sri Lanka. The main objectives of the PUCSL are to regulate the prices, safety of consumers and highlight the rights of the customers, while also improving facilities in these showrooms.
The PUCSL has identified several issues, one being that of inadequate distribution of electricity. Due to power shortages consumers could use only a few charging stations. The accuracy of readings in charging meters also remains at a questionable level since customers cannot guarantee if there vehicle has been charged as expected.
There are two ways in which customers are charged at these stations. One way is by measuring the number of Kilo Watts per hour or charging people by the number of hours they took to charge their vehicle. Since many customers are not satisfied for being charged by the hour, a proper pricing system has to be implemented.
Some customers are of the view that they could directly plug in their vehicle to a power socket and get it charged but the type of plug vary from vehicle to vehicle. For example, the Leaf brand manufactured in Japan has a 20A plug. For this purpose close to 15A has to be spent and a socket would cost close to Rs. 100,000. Due to higher value, customers tend to buy low quality sockets at cheaper rates which are not advisable because if used for over 10 hours, such low quality sockets would heat up and catch fire.
Taking these matters into consideration, the PUCSL has identified the importance to regulate charging stations. Hence the PUCSL is in the process of conducting an awareness programme in September, where customers as well as officials working in these charging stations could put in their concerns, ideas and feedback and improve the quality of service. Through this programme the PUCSL will formulate the necessary laws and regulations, pricing and other procedures and make them duly available to the public.
New technology too will be introduced towards the latter part of the year. Through regulating these stations a fixed pricing scheme will be introduced as well.
As at present, customers are charged at different rates. For instance, in and around Colombo the price is Rs. 50 per hour while it?s Rs. 70 in outstation venues. Since the electricity price for customers is the same island wide, it is not fair to charge people at different rates. Hence the PUCSL has identified such flaws in the system and by regulating these charging stations both customers and officials working in them will be protected.

The purohita who too was quite candid in his comments said:?
?To tell you the truth, we are engaged in a struggle to protect this Government. We tell the people various things just to save the situation and get blackguarded by them at the end of the day.? By the way, none in the group wanted the purohita to explain what he meant by ?various things?.?

"I was removed to sweep bond scam under the carpet"
	
Former Justice and Buddha Sasana Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe said today he didn?t resign from any portfolio but was removed in an attempt to sweep the bond scam under the carpet.
He told the media outside the Justice Ministry that baseless charges had been made against him saying he had struck deals with former government members to delay court cases filed against them.
?This is an attempt to sweep the bond scam under the carpet by sacrificing me. In Sri Lanka's history, this is the first time a minister was accused of not influencing the judiciary and the Attorney General?s Department whereas former justice ministers had been accused of influencing the judiciary,? he said.
Mr. Rajapakshe said the AG had been summoned to Temple Trees last Tuesday and the UNP backbench MPs had criticized and ridiculed him.
?They have urged him to finish, within two weeks, the court cases filed against individuals named and selected by them,? he said and added that he was accused of breaching the collective responsibility of the Cabinet when he revealed that the agreement to handover Hambantota Port to China was against the Constitution.
He said according to Article 157 of the Constitution, a two-thirds majority was required Parliament to enter into an agreement like the one to handover the Hambantota Port.
?The Cabinet has collectively violated the Constitution by agreeing to the Hambantota deal. When I revealed this as a minister, then I was accused of breaching the collective responsibility of the Cabinet. Today, the agreement is only a paper which is legally null and void,? he said.
Mr. Rajapakshe said it was the Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA) which had the authority to handover operations of the port but not the port.
?There is a group of people who are angered by my revelation. On the other hand, according to my conscience there is nothing more shameful than staying in a Cabinet when the assets are being sold,? he said and added that the second reason behind his removal was the Central Bank bond scam.
?The CB bond scam is the biggest financial fraud ever committed in Sri Lanka since the days of King Pandukabhaya. With a presidential commission being appointed unexpectedly, the names of the big shots behind the scam are being revealed now. When the deals of the footnote gang which attempted to conceal the scam was revealed, people are afraid now. I maintained the independence of the AG?s Department. People accept the Bond Commission to recommend more action against more people. When the AG?s Department was continueing to function independently under me, those who are involved in the bond scam can?t go free. Therefore, they want to break the AG Department's spinal cord,? he said.
When asked about the Avant Garde issue, Mr. Rajapakshe said the former Attorney General had said no criminal case could be filed over the issue.
?If action is being taken against anyone, then the arrests should begin with the defence secretary because the navy still stores government weapons on an Avant Garde ship docked in the Red Sea. About 500 such weapons are stored there. Therefore, officials beginning with the current defence minister should be held responsible. No action can be taken against me,? he said.
Mr. Rajapakshe said a special presidential commission appointed to look into the issue had submitted its report to the President saying the Avant Garde issue was not illegal.
While saying he would reveal his political journey later, the former minister said, ?I invite people to decide the fate of the government which feeds on national assets,?. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Indian customs nets 24kg of hashish bound for Sri Lanka
	
Customs preventive division from Tuticorin in India seized 24kg of hashish, a narcotic substance, which was planned to be smuggled to Sri Lanka.
The gang, which carried the contraband, however escaped. Though sleuths opened fire in order to stop the gang, it did not stop and escaped by sea. The worth of the seized contraband is said to be in crores.
Officials said they received secret information about the smuggling activity in Therespuram shore area. Based on the tip-off, a team of officials undertook a vigil between Therespuram shore and Thalamuthu Town shore. They saw a man alighting from an autorickshaw in Thalamuthu Town shore. The man carrying a consignment started walking towards the sea. When the officials asked him to stop, he took to his feet and rushed towards a boat which was ready to sail.
He boarded the boat, where two more people were already present. As it started sailing, the team opened five rounds in order to deter them and stop. "We did not target the smugglers or the boat. We opened fire aiming the sky in order to stop them. But they were not deterred and escaped," said a customs official.
While the smugglers escaped, officials detained an autorickshaw driver, Ramesh, hailing from Anna Nagar area, who came to drop one of them. Officials said the driver dropped the key smuggler along with the contraband. When quizzed, he told police that he did not know anything about the consignment. He was hired by one Darshagir, 68, from 7th street in Anna Nagar.(TOI)

Making a mockery of meditation
	
After video images showing the inspector general of police manhandling an employee (said to be a lift operator) at police headquarters went viral, one would have expected an official explanation, and a personal apology, from the IGP. None has been forthcoming. ?
The employee allegedly aroused the IGP?s wrath because he failed to observe a new directive requesting all police department employees to meditate before commencing work in the morning. ?
First of all, one must see if this incident occurred before the IGP did his morning meditation duty, or after. ?
If it?s after, then it makes a mockery of such a practice. Meditation is expected to calm us down and make us feel benevolent and merciful towards those around us. This includes all forms of life, be they lift operators or ants. ?
If it?s before, there?s still no excuse for the action, but one could at least put it down to typical police high-handedness. ?
While the practice of meditation anywhere is praiseworthy, there are several issues worth considering. ?
One understands that it?s Buddhist meditation that police employees are required to practice. This would put non-Buddhist personnel in some difficulty. The argument that meditation is good for everyone regardless of religion can?t be used here. People seek meditation for a variety of reasons. Schools and varieties of meditation number in the hundreds, and can be broadly narrowed down to about two dozen. Seeking meditation due to personal reasons is one thing. Having it imposed on en masse by a directive is another, because then there is no personal choice. This is equal to making it compulsory for all members of any institution (schools, university, supermarket chain or department) to take Vitamin C everyday because it can strengthen one?s constitution and may prevent flu. If anyone doesn?t want to take Vitamin C, it?s a personal choice and forcing him or her to take it would amount a violation of fundamental rights. ?
Many existing meditation practices have their origins in India, Tibet or the Far East (China, Vietnam, Japan). They may be derived from or related to Buddhism and Hinduism (Loving Kindness or Metta meditation), Vipassana meditation, Zen or Zazen meditation, Focused Attention meditation and Mantra meditation. But there are also Sikh, Jain, Hindu and Yoga meditation practices and modern derivatives such as Transcendental Meditation. Yogic meditation includes Third Eye, Chakra, Kundalini, Sound (Nada), Tantra and Pranayama meditation, while Chinese practice offers Qigong. Then there?s Christian meditation such as contemplative prayer. ?
One understands that it?s Buddhist meditation that police employees are required to practice. This would put non-Buddhist personnel in some difficulty
All these are equally valid practices and need guidance. Meditation can affect the subconscious and shouldn?t be undertaken at the start without personal supervision by trained teachers. Has the Police Department offered its employees such services? Looking at those video images, the answer can be assumed to be negative. As for police high-handedness, it?s an old illness which no amount of meditation may be able to put right.?

Smart ID in two months: DRP Commissioner
	
The Department for Registration of Persons (DRP) would issue a new ?Smart ID? within the coming two months, after the introduction of the present NICs some 45 years ago, Department?s Commissioner General Viyani Gunathilaka said today.
He said that the decision was taken considering several issues regarding the current National Identity Cards (NICs).
?The Department will issue the present Identity card with the front facing image from September 1 and the Smart Card would be issued from October.
The photo which will be laser engraved on a special polycarbonate plastic would be taken according to international standards and using special software provided by the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO).?
?The photo would be printed on the card using laser engraving technology, which cannot be tampered with,? he said.
The Department has registered 1,700 studios country wide.
Gunathilaka said that these studios had been issued with the ICAO software and the photos would be sent to the Department online.?
?The new IDs will be issued in to two steps for new applicants. As the first step the facing of the photo, would be changed and later the Smart ID would be issued.
?As the second step the Department had decided to start a new registry of Sri Lankan citizens. After collecting data of citizens the DRP will start issuing the Electronic Identity (E-ID) Card from end of 2018 or beginning 2019,? he said.
?The new identity card will include biometric details, barcode, holder?s signature, and the expiry date in three languages,? he said.
?The new identity card has to be renewed after ten years. If persons taking or changing their E-ID after 40 years of age there is no need for renewal, but persons younger than 40 will have to renew,? he said.
The major function of the National e-ID Card will be containing key information of the card holder in the database. Information such as the National Identification Number (NIN), the Cardholder/applicant?s address, name and other details are stored here and securely locked away and can only be read by authorised terminals or Card Acceptance Devices (CADs).

The devil wasn?t a faulty electric wire, but a parent?s negligence
	
The tragedies linked to human lives take place more often than not, due to the ignorance and carelessness of people. It need not be said that adults should be held responsible for the safety of children. This is because these children, once becoming adults, will be chief contributors in the drive towards developing the world. If the adults shirk their responsibility, then the society has to face tragedies which will lead to its deterioration. If parents don?t play their roles, this will slowly, but surely happen. ??
This is another tragedy caused due to the carelessness of parents. ?
The weeping and lamenting that emanated from a house close to Pulasthipura Police Station in Polonnaruwa were so powerful that it drew the attention of many people. Folks in the area ran towards the place where the noises were emanating in search of reasons. Among those who ran were the officers of the Pulasthipura Police Station who were on duty at that time. It didn?t take much time for many onlookers to realize why over a dozen women were weeping. They had asked for help to save the lives of a mother and a child who had been electrocuted. Although they were freed from the cable-tied to a coconut tree-the duo had died despite being admitted to the hospital. ?
The two who faced tragic deaths last Wednesday (16) were identified as residents of No 17/2 Bauddharthagama in the Farmer Settlement (B.O.P 316) in Thalpotha, Polonnaruwa. ?The deceased were identified as Rajapakse Gamage Gayani Damayanthi (34), a mother of two children, and her youngest son Nethsara (6). ??
Gayani?s husband Rohitha Samarakone (38), who is the breadwinner of the family, is employed in a garment factory in Batticaloa. All the household chores, including sending the children to school, had been done by Gayani. Their daughter (the eldest in the family) was scheduled to face the Scholarship Examination this year. The son was studying in year one at school. ?
They had asked for help to save the lives of a mother and a child who had been electrocuted. Although they were freed from the cable-tied to a coconut tree-the duo had died despite being admitted to the hospital
Arrangements had been made by the parents to send their daughter, who was scheduled to face the Grade 5 Scholarship Examination, to a tuition class which was situated in Thalpotha area (B.O.P. 316). The tuition class is located close to the Pulasthipura Police Station. There are about 28 children studying in their daughter?s class. It was known to all that ?classes relating to the exam had to be finished on Wednesday (16). ?The Scholarship examination was held on Sunday (20). Therefore, the parents concerned had decided to offer lunch to all children who had studied in this tuition class. ??
Accordingly, a house, close to the tuition class, had been selected for that purpose on that fateful day. Having sent her daughter to the tuition class, Gayani and her little child had come on time to the house where lunch was being prepared. Having heard a shrill scream of a child, Gayani had run towards the front of the house. She was shocked to see her child squirming in excruciating pain, and lying on the ground. While lamenting over the tragic incident, she had tried to pick up the child. As a result she had been thrown away and fallen on the ground. When one of Gayani?s friends tried to lift the child, the people present understood that the accidents had taken place due to electrocution. Later this bevy of women had cried for help from the neighbors. ??
According to the doctors, despite the fact that the mother and child were taken to the hospital for medical treatment, they had breathed their last. ?According to Police investigations, it was revealed that there was a leakage in electricity from a wire fixed to the iron cable which was linked to the power source.?
While lamenting over the tragic incident, she had tried to pick up the child. As a result she had been thrown away and fall on the ground
At the post-mortem held at the Polonnaruwa General Hospital, the Judicial Medical Officer, Namal Bandara Jayalath, had reported that there were signs of electrocution when inspecting the dead bodies. The post-mortem was held at the Polonnaruwa General Hospital in the presence of the coroner into sudden deaths, S.A.Gunasena of Kaudulla Division. ?
Garthipunchi Hewage Subani Sanjeewani (37) , a resident of Thalpotha, Polonnaruwa giving evidence said,? The daughter of the deceased, Gayani and my daughter were in the same scholarship class. We discussed with the parents of other children to give a lunch to the children and teachers who taught them. That day was a Wednesday (16). Gayani had sent her daughter to the tuition class and she arrived with her youngest child to the house where the lunch was prepared. The lunch was prepared at the home where another student of the tuition class Ruwini Nisansala resided. We were washing the pots and pans near the well after preparing the lunch, at about 11.00 a.m.
It was then that we heard the cries of Gayani screaming for help in order to save her child. As soon as I rushed to the scene, I saw both of them lying on the ground. I tried to lift the child and I was also on the verge of being electrocuted. We all cried for help. With the help of neighbors the child was freed with the help of a stick. I ran with the child and together with the others managed to bring both of them to the Pulasthigama Hospital. Later we came to know that both had passed away?. ?
The premature deaths of Gayani Damayanthi (34) and her child, Daham Nethsara, were accidental. It?s depressing to hear such tragic stories. ?

Uniform doesn't sanction one to commit crimes: Navy Chief
	
Navy Commander Travis Sinniah said today wearing a uniform does not give anyone sanction to rob, murder or torture another.
Addressing a recent press briefing at the Navy Headquarters, the Navy Commander said if anyone were proven guilty of committing a crime or punishable offense, then he or she should be punished whatsoever.
"In Sri Lanka, everyone is innocent until they are proven guilty. In the navy, if anyone were indicted with criminal offences and proven guilty either by the Navy Act or penal code, then he or she should be punished accordingly," he said.
Speaking of future challenges to the navy, Vice Admiral Sinniah said their future role was to protect commercial trade between the Gulf of Aden to the Strait of Malacca in case of a conflict.
Responding to a question raised on navy?s capacity to track submarines, the Navy Commander said they were equipped with advanced systems that could detect submarines in Lankan waters.
"So far, we do not have any threat from neighbouring states. Submarines outside our territory are not a threat. However, we would like to enhance our capabilities to be able to detect submarines approaching our waters," he said. (Darshana Sanjeewa)

The joint opposition today refuted the allegation that former Justice Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe would contest the general election as the common candidate of the JO.
Addressing a news briefing, MP Dilum Amunugama said the joint opposition never went behind any common candidate and would not do so in future.
?We will field our own candidate, not a common candidate,? he said.
However, when asked if the JO would accept MP Rajapakshe to their party, MP Amunugama said they would accept not only MP Rajapakshe but anyone who were willing to join them.
He said the JO would not have any special meeting with MP Rajapakshe or any other individual as long as they followed the same ideology.
He said the removal of ministerial portfolios from Mr. Rajapakshe reflected the extent to which the UNP would go to take revenge on their opponents.
?Although the party gave MP Rajapakshe a deadline to withdraw the statements he made over the Hambantota Port, he didn?t to do so. He stood by his word and therefore, the UNP wanted him removed,? MP Amunugama said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

William Henry Samaranayake Unassuming disposition; dignity without pride
	
Forty eight years of loneliness?
and pain
We long to hear your voice again.
To hold your hand, to see your face
To have you fill your vacant place,
But when our hearts seem?
dark and drear
Our heart beat tells us you?
are near,
Still loving, helpful as before.
And that helps us to bear the blow.
God grant you rest is our?
heartfelt prayer,
We commit you to his care.

Remembering a great educationist, founder, Principal?and Philanthropist on his 48th death anniversary
The passing away of Mr. William Henry Samaranayake, retired Principal of St. Bernadette?s College, Polgahawela in the year 1969, had removed from the public life of this country a great educationist and silent social workers, whose activities were directed to the welfare of students, many of whom rose to power and distinction.?
When Mr. Samaranayake took over St. Bernadette?s College it had only a few cadjan huts to house the students. Samaranayake?s courage and perseverance helped to produce the land and the magnificent building, which houses the college today. Mr. Samaranayake was not only of an unassuming disposition but also had dignity without pride.
He was calm and collected in manner and was a gentleman par excellence. Mr. Samaranayake belonged to an age which is fast sliding into history but he successfully accomplished his tasks reaching eminence in diverse fields. His philanthropic genius enabled many unfortunates to bask in the sunshine of his great hearted munificence and acts of generosity. Educationists of Mr. Samaranayake?s stamp, mettle and genius are indeed today rare as sandalwood trees which adorn the jungles of Sri Lanka.
Mr. Samaranayake will long be remembered as the great educationist who disciplined and moulded the characters of students to be respectful towards parents, elders and the State. Those students who occupy positions of dignity in the land today owe a great deal to Mr. Samaranayake.?
He was also a prolific writer to the press and his articles were directed towards creating public opinion. Three great positions worthy of human ambition are to be the ruler of a great city, the Principal of a great school or the author of a great book.
Educationists of?Mr. Samaranayake?s stamp, mettle and genius are indeed today rare as sandalwood trees which adorn the jungles of Sri Lanka
Mr. Samaranayake was not only the Principal of that great school St. Bernadette?s College, but he was also the author of four great books ?English with a Smile (Books 1,2 & 3) Practical English ?which is almost a vade mecum and a sine qua non to students of English in Sri Lanka.?
W.H. Samaranayake has gone to his eternal rest, but he will live forever in his great books ?English with a Smile & Practical English ?which as text books in Sri Lankan schools have proved and will prove as invaluable guides to generations of teachers and students for years.
The world has lost a great educationist, who was distinguished for his simplicity, his high sense of duty and integrity.?
His 48th death anniversary falls on August 26, 2017. His 111th birth anniversary falls on the 26th of November 2017.
