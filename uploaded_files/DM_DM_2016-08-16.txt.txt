BC files action against Sajin Vass
	
The Bribery Commission (BC) today filed action against Sajin Vass Gunawardena, ex-MP and ex- CEO of budget airline Mihin Lanka, for entering into an illegal contract worth Rs.883 million with a Singaporean company to obtain ground handling equipment for the airline.
A spokesperson for the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption said charges were filed at the Colombo Chief Magistrate's Court under case No:58311.
Investigations had revealed that Mr. Gunawardena had entered into the three-year contract with Singaporean Company PPL Inter Private Limited in September 2015 for the supply of ground handling equipment to the airline.
Mr. Gunawardena as the then CEO was not only liable for not following correct tender procedure to seek services from the foreign company but had also disregarded responses from three other companies that showed a willingness to supply such equipment.
Mihin Lanka had placed an advertisement in the paper calling for the expression of interests for the particular services and three other companies had responded.
It was also revealed that Mr. Gunawardena had failed to state any specific reasons for granting the contract to the mentioned company. (Kurulu Koojana Kariyakarawana)

BOC introduces Power Plus childrens investment plan
	
Bank of Ceylons (BOC) newest Power Plus childrens investment plan is the ideal solution that empowers growing children to bloom to their full potential in financially secured surroundings. With the stability built over 77 years, a state-owned bank is the safest place for your hard-earned money especially for a profitable long-term investment for your child.
The uniqueness in this scheme is that parents can actually aim for a specifically targeted balance rather than saving randomly not knowing, what the final balance might be. This newest investment plan is offered to children of age one year up to the age of 17 years.
There are four types of investment plans offered by the bank ranging from offers from Rs.500,000 and going to as Rs.1 million, Rs.2 million and up to Rs.5 million as the return at the maturity, which yields an annual interest rate of 8 percent per annum over the entire
investment period.
The account will have to be maintained till the child reaches 18 years of age to obtain this benefit. For children between one to 18 years, the investment duration and the monthly instalment will vary accordingly. However, this investment plan will not accommodate children who are over 15 years as the minimum investment duration of three years will not be met.
The minimum instalment will depend on the desired return and the investment duration, that is until the child reaches 18 years. A parent, guardian or any other individual can open the account on behalf of the child. After opening the account, all deposits can be made seamlessly by logging into the banks online banking facility or through any of the available cash deposit machines at anytime of the day or at any of the banks
628 branches.
Customers can also simply place a standing order covering the full investment duration to ensure a timely deposit is made to the beneficiary account from the depositors account at one time. Further information can be obtained through the banks website, Facebook page, through twitter or from the banks LinkedIn page and from the nearest BOC branch.
In the case of no instalment made to the account either consecutively and/or intermittently, the bank will give a concession/grace period up to a maximum of six months or if it exceeds the grace period, the outstanding will be transferred to a Ran Kekulu account under the name of the child. Even in such instances, the child will get one percent above the interest rate than of a normal savings account and many other benefits that are attached to the BOC Ran Kekulu account. Similarly the banks 14 Plus account, which targets teenagers aged from 14 till 18 that, offers 0.5 percent interest than the normal savings account interest and a debit card that enables the account holder to use it under the guidance of his/hers parents.

ETCA may be a reality: Y.K. Sinha
	
Proposed Economic and Technology Cooperation Agreement (ETCA) with India, the pact, which would be an improvement over the existing Free Trade Agreement (FTA), may soon be a reality.
Indicating this, Y.K. Sinha, Indias High Commissioner, used the 70th Independence Day as the occasion to tell critics and skeptics of the ETCA that it is up to Sri Lankans themselves to decide on the contours of any agreement that they sign with a foreign country. However, there had to be genuine debate and discussion among stakeholders in Sri Lanka.
Mr. Sinha, who hoisted the tricolour flag at his residence here on Monday morning, referred to the latest round of discussion on the pact in Colombo last week and expressed the hope that the agreement, when signed, would be of mutual benefit to both countries which will be win-win situation for all.
On the bilateral trade, the High Commissioner said it was $4.6 billion last year, of which Indian exports were valued at about $ four billion and Sri Lankan exports  $645 million. Nearly 60 per cent of Sri Lankan exports were making use of the FTA whereas 90 per cent Indian exports did not use the channel. It is obvious who has benefitted more from the FTA, he argued.
Mr. Sinha added that as per latest estimates, the economic growth rate of India was expected to touch eight per cent during the current financial year. (The Hindu)

Ranaweera, CBSL Senior Assistant Director Jayantha Abeyratne, Chief Manager Credit Manjula Dissanayaka and HDFC Bank Manager Development Credit Anura Dissanayaka


Housing Development Finance Corporation Bank of Sri Lanka (HDFC) signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) recently with the objective of empowering the self-employed sector in the country.
This Self-Employment Promotion Initiative (SEPI) loan scheme will focus to provide financial assistance to trained youth who pass out from vocational training institutions that come under the purview of the Ministry of Skill Development and Vocational Training (MSDVT) to start self-employment projects.
Though the trainees gain knowledge and skills in different technology areas and are fully competent, it is difficult for them to find a job since most of the industries are located in urban areas and lack of financial facilities is a major barrier for emerging them as entrepreneurs. Hence, the SEPI will provide financial assistance to these trained youth who have completed the courses from recognized vocational training institutes, for establishment of their own self-employment projects. The new loan scheme covers categories of agriculture, industrial, information technology, automotive, construction, electronic and telecommunications, food, refrigeration and air condition, farm machinery, digital imaging and printing, jewelry designing and manufacturing, welding and fabrications sectors and other innovative technology areas.
HDFC Bank expects to fulfill the financial needs of the youth who have undergone a professional training in a specific field from the vocational training institutions to start their own enterprise through the
SEPI loan scheme.
HDFCs primary objective has always been to serve lower and middle-income groups to meet their needs of housing finance and allied services.

HNB committed to delivering Banking Beyond Transactions
	
Hatton National Bank (HNB) has recently embarked on the third phase of its repositioning strategy under which its overarching commitment has been to deliver Banking Beyond Transactions. The bank has embraced a divergent approach of taking the bank to the street, a proactive customer-acquisition mindset. This resonates with a global shift where customers no longer wish to walk into banks, instead utilizing the conveniences offered through ATMs, Internet and mobile banking and personalized services.
For Sri Lanka, this remains a major change in mindset and HNBs challenge was to inspire its employees to move out from behind their desks to the customer contact frontlines. Over the past 18-24 months, HNB has empowered its staff by giving them the right training, tools and incentives
for the transition.
HNB Deputy General Manager Retail and SME Banking Thimal Perera speaking about the shift said, We have achieved this in three ways  first by simplifying our processes to optimize our operating model; second, we have offered alternate channels such as Internet and mobile banking for routine transactions thereby freeing up our branches to focus on sales and service; and thirdly, we have opted for the centralization of tasks such as branch operations and credit underwriting, which has meant that our branch and regional heads can now spend more time
building relationships.
In todays banking environment, there is no promotion, nor marketing campaign that cannot be replicated by competitors; going forward, the only differentiating factor therefore will be service excellence. Perera pointed out that the bank has now appointed customer experience officers to optimize its service promise.
He said, Our service focus includes a very deep look at the entire experience of a customer who banks with us. Across our operations, we have taken a critical look at why we do things the way we do them and we have been swift to start making changes where we felt they were needed. For example, we are a bank with a history of 128 years and naturally, we found many practices that have been handed down through the years, which needed to evolve. By putting the customer at the heart of the solution, we have been able to simplify our processes and identify conveniences that matter.
As part of its technology leadership drive, HNB has been at the forefront of manipulating technology for customer convenience; it has dominated the crossover of tech into the banking space to provide better solutions that meet the existing and anticipated customer needs. Today, technology has been well integrated across the banks business verticals  from trade finance in corporate banking and corporate Internet banking, to the distributor and supplier financing for small and medium enterprise (SME) clients, the pay fast salary processing platform for retail clients and Internet and mobile banking platforms.
Perera emphasized, Our product design process takes care to ensure that we are not innovating for the mere sake of an exciting innovation; our emphasis is purely on innovating to meet a real need and to deliver convenience. A good example of this has been our youth prepaid account: we realized the challenge most parents face when it comes to handing pocket money to their children. Our solution was a prepaid card that allows parents full control from loading money remotely, to controlling where the card is used and being alerted when a transaction has been performed.
Another good illustration of listening to customer needs would be our inward remittance innovation where HNB customers are now able to make payments to anyone anywhere in Sri Lanka through ATMs. This was in response to the prevalence of many domestic employees in Colombo who had monetary responsibilities in their hometowns. The service allows customers to use an ATM or mobile banking to initiate the service with the recipient receiving half a PIN on his mobile device via SMS; the sender provides the other half of the PIN to ensure dual authentication. Receivers are then able to withdraw the funds through a cardless transaction via ATM. Propelling the bank to being ahead of the curve has also meant acquiring intelligence and data mining capabilities that provide deep insights into customer and industry behaviour. HNB has utilized its extensive network of customer touch points including a 250 strong branch network to build its knowledge base; by mining that data, the bank is able to respond with agility to market threats and opportunities.
As a systemically important bank, HNBs responsibility extends to the provision of banking access to the very grassroots of Sri Lanka; the banks customer profile and product portfolio reflect the balance of its services to serve as a meaningful partner in everyones progress. HNB has a solid presence in the microfinance environment through its subsidiary HNB Grameen, a strong SME portfolio that has many success stories within it, and a corporate banking arm that boasts of a clientele representing the biggest businesses in the country. In the retail banking space, HNB has stamped its leadership having been named Best Retail Bank in Sri Lanka by the Asian Banker Magazine on eight occasions, including 2015.
During the coming year, the bank is looking at extending its leadership in several key segments including the housing loan market. Its flagship Shanthi home loans product now offers tripartite agreements with high-rise building developers, simplifying the purchase for a buyer. Shanthi home loans have introduced mobile mortgage advisors who are able to meet the customers anywhere at their convenience. The bank is also considering leasing a thrust area  the past year has seen a doubling of the HNB leasing portfolio  the largest among banks. HNBs credit card operations have also been a lucrative segment for the bank and its proposition that includes excellent seasonal offers has been much sought after by customers.

Malakas nightclub brawl: Scot hopes justice done
	
A Scots engineer who became an overnight celebrity in Sri Lanka after punching a son of a government minister has spoken of his hope to see justice done as a long-running investigation into the incident finally comes to court, Herald Scotland reported.
James Casserly, originally from Shotts in North Lanarkshire, was hailed a hero by the local press after he tackled Malaka Silva during a Halloween night out at the Rhythm & Blues nightclub in the Sri Lankan capital Colombo in 2014.
However, the publicity over the case ultimately led to the loss of his dream job and forced him to return to Scotland.
Mr Casserly, now 44, was celebrating his birthday with girlfriend Belinda Mackenzie when Mr Silva - who was in the venue despite a court ban on entering nightclubs over previous claims of unruly behaviour - approached 24-year-old Ms Mackenzie and allegedly groped her. When she pushed him away, he is said to have struck her twice in the face and head.
Mr Casserly retaliated, punching the ministers son, but within seconds he said he was wrestled to the ground while Mr Silvas bodyguards kicked him around the head, causing injuries that have impaired his vision.
However, Mr Silva - the son of Sri Lankas controversial former minister of public relations - told investigators that he was attacked by Mr Casserly after intervening to stop the Scot beating up his girlfriend. His father Mervyn Silva claimed the incident had been orchestrated by his political enemies to discredit him in the midst of Sri Lankas elections.
Next Wednesday, a court will consider the evidence of the police investigation for the first time and decide whether to bring any charges in the case. Mr Casserly, who is flying out to attend the hearing, also faces the offer of an out-of-court settlement proposed by Mr Silvas lawyers.
Mr Casserly said: When I went out to Sri Lanka I had a great job, big salary, house, car - it was the dream job. But I ended up losing it all through this. I took time off to look after Belinda, and my company didnt like all the media attention, so in the end I lost my job and I had to come back here. All because of this guy. Hes taken everything from me, so I just want justice.
Mr Casserly fell in love with Sri Lanka after he moved to the island nation, south of India, in 2013 to be group engineer for a textiles manufacturer, but said the cause clbre status of the case made life too difficult to stay.
It was in all the newspapers - all over the news. I would be walking down the street and people are coming up to shake my hand, wanting to take a photograph.
But this guy has a big reputation. I had threatening phone calls and some guy turned up at my house saying you better drop the case.

Much to be done before achieving reconciliation: US
	
Despite all positive steps by the government to achieve reconciliation, there is still much to be done before Sri Lanka can realize its full potential as a global example of how a post-conflict country can achieve lasting peace, US Ambassador Atul Keshap said.
Speaking at the inauguration of the US Pacific Commands Pacific Angel exercise in Jaffna on Monday, he said the UNHR Chief was due to make a report on the Governments progress toward implementing its reconciliation and accountability promises made in Geneva last year.
We support the governments efforts to meet its commitments made in Geneva and will help. This will be difficult but it is necessary, and it is for the good of all Sri Lankans and for their happiness, he said.
He said the government has taken positive steps to issue certificates of absence to the families of the missing and to return more lands to internally displaced persons and applauded the establishment of an Office of Missing Persons.
We know the government has committed to establish truth and reconciliation and judicial mechanisms to investigate war crimes, to replace the PTA, to charge or release the remaining security-related detainees and dismantle the culture of surveillance for a reconciled, united, peaceful, prosperous Sri Lanka, he said.
Dozens of US military doctors and engineers, who had come from Honolulu, Hawaii, Las Vegas, Nevada, California, and other places, had partnered with Sri Lankan colleagues to repair schools and libraries and provide needed healthcare services at locations around the Northern Province under the Pacific Angel Programme.
Ambassador Keshap said he had the privilege of visiting Idaikadu School and witness Sri Lankan and American military personnel working closely with colleagues from Maldives, Nepal, and Bangladesh to help with civilian doctors and volunteers to assist communities in need, and to provide medical treatment free of charge to people in need.
In his remarks, the Ambassador said the US stood ready to support the people and the Sri Lankan Government in a shared vision for a reconciled, unified country.
As Sri Lanka seizes on this golden moment of national reconciliation, we will remain your friend and partner. The whole world applauds the vision of a strong, unified, democratic, and prosperous Sri Lanka. We want to join hands with you and your government to help rebuild the economy, advance good governance, and ensure equal rights, equal opportunity, and the full benefits of post-conflict development for all, regardless of ethnicity or religion or gender, he said.

Regional Development Minister Sarath Fonseka said today that 90 percent of the investigations into two complaints against former defence secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa had been completed -- and that he would have to face the consequences soon.
Two complaints had been received against Mr. Rajapaksa: one regarding the purchasing of MiG aircraft for the Air Force for US$ 7 million in an improper manner; and the other regarding the misappropriation of Rs. 90 million to renovate the D.A. Rajapaksa memorial. 90 percent of the investigations into those complaints have been completed by now. He will have to answer those allegations very soon, he said.
He said so at the National library where he participated in a book launch.
He said MP Namal Rajapaksa had been remanded on written evidence and documents.
We promised the people that we would investigate the frauds and corrupt acts of the previous regime and we are doing that. Though former president Mahinda Rajapaksa is trying to whitewash his family, it is now too late, he said.
When asked about the setting up of the Office of Missing Persons, he said no soldier should object to it as none of them had violated the law.
He said the office was set up not at the urging of any foreign power but to show the international community that everything that happens in Sri Lanka is transparent and legal.
We see this as an act of respect to international law and human rights laws, he said. (Ajith Siriwardana)

## Title: Prabhakaran's deputy was a RAW agent: Book
## Section: Breaking News

Prabhakaran's deputy was a RAW agent: Book
	
LTTE leader Gopalaswamy Mahendrarajah alias Mahattaya, who was once a deputy to the banned terrorist outfit's chief Velupillai Prabhakaran, was a RAW agent recruited as early as in 1989, a book compiled by Indian Journalist Neena Gopal said.
The Times of India said she had interviewed former Indian PM Rajiv Gandhi moments before he was assassinated in 1991 and that she says that Mahattaya, was a Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) mole.
"The man was cultivated and positioned by RAW as their mole inside Prabhakaran's hitherto impenetrable ranks as early as 1989," she says in her book `The Assassination of Rajiv Gandhi' (Penguin).
"He would become their deep asset, the one who would subvert the insurgent movement from the inside and had been tasked with eliminating Prabhakaran and taking over the LTTE," the book says.
RAW's links with Mahattaya, who the LTTE later executed on charges of being an Indian intelligence agent, was not known to the Indian Military Intelligence or the Intelligence Bureau, it says.
The LTTE reportedly suspected that it was Mahattaya, who tipped off the Indians about a Tamil Tiger ship in January 1993, leading to the death of former Jaffna LTTE commander Kittu, a childhood friend of Prabhakaran.
According to the book, Mahattaya was reportedly seized by the LTTE and taken to a camp where he was "tortured over a period of several weeks and months until he could barely speak, sit or stand. "He was finally executed in December 1994, 19 months (later).
Some 257 of his men were executed and their bodies dumped, LTTE style, in a pit and set on fire."
Despite the RAW's covert penetration of the LTTE, the Indian military, civilian intelligence and its diplomats worked at cross-purposes when the Indian military was deployed in Sri Lanka's northeast in 1987-90, the book says.
The Sri Lankan military finally crushed the LTTE in May 2009, leaving thousands dead in the final months of a brutal conflict that began some 30 years ago. The book also suggests that RAW which like other Indian institutions felt betrayed after Prabhakaran ordered Rajiv Gandhi's killing -may have had a hand in the LTTE chief's elimination.
"RAW sources say that until the very last minute, Prabhakaran was tricked into believing that surrendering (by him and his men in 2009) was a viable option, and that he would be handed over to a neutral international group and not the Sri Lankan government as Colombo wanted." The RAW's ability to cultivate assets in the LTTE was one reason for its overconfidence vis-a-vis the Tigers.
Accordingly, the agency failed to factor that the LTTE leader would avenge the fighting against the Indian military in Sri Lanka by targeting Rajiv Gandhi one day.
Neena Gopal quotes a senior RAW officer as saying: "If we had read the signals right, if we understood what was going on in Prabhakaran's mind, who knows, we could have prevented this. It was our fault, we made a huge error of judgement. We misread Prabhakaran. We never believed he would turn against us in this manner. We should have seen it coming. We failed Rajiv Gandhi, we failed to save his life."
The author had been interviewing Gandhi until he reached the election rally ground at Sriperumpudur near Chennai on the night of May 21, 1991. A little later, Gandhi was killed by a LTTE woman suicide bomber. She says that Gandhi "had an almost prescient premonition of his own death."
Gandhi then told the author: "Have you noticed how every time any South Asian leader of any import rises to a position of power or is about to achieve something for himself or his country, he is cut down, attacked, killed..."

Wining and dining an unwelcome visitor!
	

There is a Police Division close to the city, where the OICs in this division are said to be discussing in whispers a curse that is plaguing them these days.

They complain that a Police high-up has made it a practice to pay inspection visits to all the Police stations in the Division and they have been compelled to wine and dine him apart from offering him valuable presents as souvenirs. They say that the predecessors of this high-up as a matter of practice used to inspect only the Police headquarters of a Division once or twice a year leaving the job of inspecting Police stations in the hands of an official of a lesser rank in the given Division.
Some misfortune or other stares in the face of the OICs who fail to accord a right royal treatment to this Police high-up on the inspection round, they say.
