A move to revive Angampora martial art
	
A provincial council which has failed to tackle even its basic problems concerning the public has decided to set apart two days for a debate on fostering? the traditional Angampora martial art. This move has raised many eyebrows while evoking derisive laughter from some others, they say.?
The proposal had been presented by two members who had once fought Angampora duels as a sport in the past, they say.??
Critics say that that it is a crime to spend Rs.1 million on a two day-debate on this proposal at a time when the Council should address priority issues like the shortage of medicine in hospitals, the recurrent safe drinking water problem, roads in a state of disrepair and numerous crying needs of the schools.

All forces behind Jan.8 change support PM: Harsha
	
Those involved in bringing about a change on January 8, 2015 are behind Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and the no-confidence motion will be defeated State Minister Harsha de Silva said today.
He said and there are other options available to deal with the motion in case it was passed.
The state minister told a media briefing that there were sufficient numbers to defeat the no-confidence motion.
?We have sufficient numbers to defeat it but there are multiple options to deal with a situation in case it is passed, especially when it comes to forming a new government,? he said.
The state minister dismissed claims made by some SLFPers that the Prime Minister has been asked to resign and said the UNP would opt for a complete re-organization and finalize reforms by April 9.
When asked whether the UNP leadership would change, the state minister said all party positions would change.
?We have all agreed on this and are standing up for the reorganization of the UNP and it will happen by Sunday,? he said adding that all UNP MPs and members of the working committee would work out the reforms. ?They have been summoned for a meeting on Saturday and Sunday to discuss this matter,? the state minister said.

A fair and lovely lady known to be very close to a leading politico was elevated to the chair of a local council recently.?
?
Visiting her official bungalow soon after assuming duties, she issued instructions to turf the front yard of the bungalow with Malaysian artificial grass and renovate the bathrooms with new tiles and new commodes. Turfing the front yard alone is estimated to cost Rs.1.3 million, they say.?
The lady also reportedly told her aides that she did not like the colour of the tiles used in the bathrooms and that they be replaced with the ones of her choice.?
She has already begun giving instructions to do things costing lots of money even without consulting the senior officials of the council, they say.

China to impose tariffs on 128 US exports
	
?
The Chinese government plans to immediately impose tariffs on 128 U.S. products, including pork and certain fruits, a direct response to President Donald Trump?s recent moves to pursue numerous trade restrictions against Beijing.??
If U.S. goods become more expensive in China, Chinese buyers could opt to purchase products from Europe, South America or elsewhere, though White House officials have routinely discounted the likelihood of this.??
Beijing?s move could force Trump to decide whether to follow through on expansive trade restrictions he had hoped would crack down on China even if Beijing is now threatening to harm U.S. companies that rely on Asian markets for buyers.??
A Twitter post from the ?People?s Daily,? an English-language news organization controlled by the Chinese government, said Sunday that ?China imposes tariffs on 128 items of imports from the U.S. including pork and fruit products starting Monday as a countermeasure in response to a previous U.S. move to slap tariffs on steel and aluminum imports: Ministry of Finance.???
The Chinese government said the tariffs would effectively serve as retaliation for restrictions Trump announced last month.China, has always been the biggest trade target for Trump. It also appears to be the first country to retaliate to his trade threats, putting pressure on leaders in Washington and Beijing to anticipate each other?s next moves quickly

## Title: Coming: ?Vaishnavee?  After years and years, Sumitra Peries will return to the screen this week.
## Section: News Features
## Date: 3 April 2018 12:51 am
Coming: ?Vaishnavee?  After years and years, Sumitra Peries will return to the screen this week.
	
I?ve been spending the last two or three weeks asking everyone I know to go and watch ?Vaishnavee,? Sumitra Peries? latest film, slated for a premiere on April 5 (coinciding with the 99th birthday of her husband) at the Regal in Colombo, and a subsequent release in all CEL circuit theatres throughout the country. Most of those I?ve talked with ? especially the young, those still in school and who would probably profit more than any other demographic from watching the movie ? are excited, but they are also numbed and confused. They don?t know how to react to a film of this sort anymore: its biggest strength and weakness. It stands on its own without any footnotes needed for us to make sense of its meaning, and that because it doesn?t contain any inner meaning. Its sense of apparentness, along with its contrapuntal mixture of the ordinary and the extraordinary, is a tribute to Sumitra?s visionary power and editing prowess. But will we take it all in???
The beauty of a film like Vaishnavee is that it evokes different kinds of responses from different kinds of audiences. Most movies unite their spectators by the fact that they like them, or dislike them, or are stumped by them. Vaishnavee in that sense is different, since it?s so apparent and out-there that there?s nothing to dig, nothing which you can hold in unison with other audiences. The young will, I predict, react to it in a different way from married women, and married women will react to it in a different way from bachelors and spinsters and widows. And I think that?s one of the movie?s key strengths: what you see in it is not what your wife, or girlfriend, or even ex-girlfriend will. It unites everyone by what some see in it that others don?t. And I think that has a lot to do with the director?s oeuvre.??
Sumitra Peries? body of work demonstrates, more than anything else, a deeply felt, sincere commitment to a task at hand, in terms of camerawork, editing, even the script. When you see Yahalu Yeheli today, you will not believe that it was not shot from a finalised script, that the script was written and rewritten as the production went on. When you see Sagara Jalaya, similarly, you will not believe that the cast and crew had to wait for one whole year for the rains to stop in the Wanni area for them to resume shooting. Even in her most banally conceived films, and scenes and sequences, you never fail to infer an almost otherworldly, breathtaking sense of mysticism, as though some higher hand were at work.??
But then this tends to worry me. How will the young take to Vaishnavee? Think of some of the movies that we?ve seen and been through from the last two years ? Aloko Udapadi, Ho Gana Pokuna, Adaraneeya Kathawak, and of course Pravegaya ? and think of the way we reacted to them. The young have always responded to the cinema, Sinhala or Tamil or Hindi or English, in a very unique way: free of the obfuscations and obscurities that we adults tend to entertain when we attempt to ?read? into a work of art. The rift in Aloko Udapadi, for instance, is between its first and second halves: the first delves into an interesting dilemma (how can you protect the Sasanaya without breaching some of the precepts laid down by the Buddha?) while the second unfortunately degenerates into an almost cosmic, and fatuous and unrealistic, series of combat scenes between the hero and the villain. I personally liked the first half; it made sense, it parsed. Imagine my shock, therefore, when a teenager I talked with recently told me point-blank that while it made sense, it was nothing compared to the action-packed, testosterone-laden scenes he gleefully encountered in the second half.??
The young (the most important demographic for any newly released film, lest you forget) typically respond to a work of art on the basis of two things: a story that flows along smoothly, and a set of elements that transcend the banality of their everyday lives. If Deveni Inima is far more popular among this specific demographic than Koombiyo, it?s not because Koombiyo lacks those elements, but because Deveni Inima, with its perpetually cricket-playing protagonist and bespectacled comrade-in-arms and crooning girlfriend, has more of them. Those elements are not to be found in great detail in Koombiyo, and they are to be found in a movie like Aloko Udapadi in just one half of the work.?
They need a story, and these movies have them, but they also want something more: to know that beneath the novelty of what they are seeing are the predictable elements ? the romances, the chivalries, the hero-meets-villain clich?s ? which they savour.??
Vaishnavee, I predict (and make this prediction with some reservations), will divide young audiences, because here is a movie which, like Aloko Udapadi, contains within itself a rift, and a fatal one at that, between its first and second halves. (I have written on this in my review of the movie, and anyway, I don?t want to delve into the plot before its release.) It?s an unusual story ? and an unusual theme popping out of that story ? and I am more than sure, as a critic and a fan of Peries? work so far, that it?s also a NEW kind of OLD film.??
Young audiences will, first and foremost, react rather favourably to the star of the plot, Osanda, the puppet maker from Matara, because he?s played by the star of Koombiyo, Thumindu Dodantanne. They will also react, more ambivalently (given that she?s one of the reasons why the second half of the movie flounders a little, favourably towards his puppet-turned-lover-and-tormenter, played by the inimitable Yashoda Wimaladharma. Here?s a movie that has the best of both worlds ? youth and innocence on one hand and age and cynicism on the other ? with its cast (Irangani Serasinghe and Jayalath Manorathne and, in cameo-like performances, Mahendra Perera and Veena Jayakody and Rohana Baddage) and crew (especially Donald Karunaratne). It?s a wonderful mixture, promising in a way, but worrying in another: What will we really say after we see this all???
I think the saving grace of Vaishnavee, in this respect and with regard to young audiences, is the theme that Sumitra and her scriptwriter, Tony Ranasinghe, have gone for. Vaishnavee doesn?t really level on love the way you?d expect its story to. For one thing, the second half is confusing in the way it leads us to believe that Osanda sees something in the woman he loved (and who eloped with another man), which he carved into the puppet who comes alive. For another thing, the entirety of the second half turns the tables on Osanda, and hence succeeds in turning him into a blameworthy character, because (as Yashodha points out in one sequence) you cannot love another person to compensate for the pain of another unrequited love. (It?s funny in one sense: if audiences understand this point, you may even hear the giggles and the cackles of laughter and cynicism in their minds while they?re watching the movie.) Sumitra?s film doesn?t really have a NEW STORY: it?s old in a different, NEW kind of way.??
When you see a film by an old master or madame, you tend to ask ?Why watch it at all??, because you know for a fact that it will be no more, and no less, than a reworked, rehashed version of everything that master or madame has done before. When a director like Sumitra Peries makes a film like this more than 40 years after her debut, that question takes on an ambivalent meaning, because you aren?t watching a recycled product, you are seeing an artist from a particular period making a film that has, in aesthetic and formal terms, much in common with that period. Sumitra?s films, most of them that is, tend to be indulgent a little: that is their most discernible lacuna, if you can call it that. There?s nothing in Vaishnavee that doesn?t make us remember this (ranging from the use of special effects to the intrusions of Yashodha?s puppet on almost every scene), but that, I think, is more a blessing than a curse for those who were involved in the movie, because it takes us back to the past, not by inserting arbitrary symbols and metaphors which seem outdated today, but by making us want to go back to the what the past thrived on: simplicity and innocence, naivet? and peaceful.??
Vaishnavee will please everyone from the demographic that includes people like me: those from their mid-twenties and thirties, who have seen and appreciated a director like Sumitra Peries despite the onslaught of cheap, commercialist fare they?re made to see and be entertained by in our theatres. For Sumitra?s latest to work out completely, however, I wish that it works out with the young: those in their pre-twenties. Will it work out though? Here?s my two cents on the matter: those who are still attending school, or even University, are in for a treat, not because Vaishnavee will deliver everything they want from a movie, but because it?s so simple and out-there that it belongs to a place and a time which will fascinate them. Unlike those epic religious tracts that literally transport us back in time, Vaishnavee doesn?t resort to facile means; it instead overwhelms you with its innocence and makes you forget the banality of the present. And for the love of the movies, if I were a schoolboy who lives in the theatres, I?d disregard what critics will write of its flaws, and tell my girlfriend to go see it. With me.

CTU hands over letter to ILO against postponing May Day celebrations
	
Ceylon Teachers Union (CTU) today handed over a letter to the International Labour Organisation (ILO) Country Office for Sri Lanka against the Cabinet decision to postpone the May Day celebrations to May 7.
Responding to a request made by the Tri-party Maha Nayaka Theras, it was decided to declare May 7 as a public and mercantile holiday this year, instead of May 1,? following a Cabinet decision, as Vesak Poya falls on April 29 and 30 this year.
In the letter handed over to ILO, the CTU General Secretary Joseph Stalin said the Cabinet decision was a result of the pressure exerted by majority ?Buddhist lobby groups?.
?Announcing this decision, the government affirmed that the decision to interfere in the age old tradition of the workers was taken due to the demand put forward by the leaders of three Buddhist sects in the country. This disturbing decision comes in the wake of anti-Muslim violence in Central Sri Lanka where the government has not taken any effective steps against the extreme Buddhist monks who were seen inciting violence against ethnic minorities,? it said.
The letter also said that the official Vesak Day falls on April 29, two days prior to May Day and the country has no tradition of having a Vesak week.
?Therefore, we urge the ILO to take up this crucial matter with relevant government authorities in order to ensure safety and collective rights of the trade unions who are committed to protect their right to freedom of peaceful assembly on the International Workers? Day,? it added.(Thilanka Kanakarathna and Indika Sri Aravinda)

Economic Management Committee still intact
	
The Cabinet Committee on Economic Management (CCEM) headed by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe was not abolished but postponed for only two weeks, Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera said.
He made the remark at a news conference held at the Finance Ministry yesterday.
?We did not submit our observations to the cabinet paper. Policy based decisions will be taken from the economic council appointed by the President. The decision to continue the CCEM would be taken following the cabinet meeting,? the Minister said.
While condemning the media reports regarding the Inland Revenue Act (IRA) which effective from April 1, Minister Samaraweera said they were all misleading.
Minister said that according to media reports interest to be subject to the income of all parties including foreign workers, senior citizens while sale of vehicles subject to a capital Gain Tax (CGT) of ten percent of the selling price, was totally baseless.
Minister explained that the income generated from the serviced rendered to persons outside the country by local individuals was exempted up to Rs.15 million per annum.
?There was a proposal to impose tax over foreign workers and on Senior citizens when the time we have this Act. Our government decided to not to collect tax from them, but to impose a tax on the interest which is Rs.1.5 million per year or more than that, those individuals will get a tax With Holding Tax (WHT). This tax is not imposed for the individuals? savings but on the interest. To gain more than Rs.1.5 million per year an individual?s should hold a apposite of a minimum of Rs. 20million in his account. It is a question to have the number of pensioners who has Rs.1.5 million in their accounts,? Minister said.
Our main ambition was to increase the tax revenue to 40 percent from 18 percent bu 2020.
While speaking to the media State Minister of Finance Eran Wickramarathne said, most of the politicians in the previous regime used to steal money continuously by granting investment concessions procedure by looking at the investors? faces and the nature of their businesses, .
Though those politicians were not proven guilty for sentence to prisons they used to steal by using that method and still the investigations are underway to prove their guilty, he said.
?When granting concessions, the ministers used to have early discussions by calling the investors or the businessmen to isolate rooms, he said.
The Inland Revenue Act (IRA) which effective from April 1, had given a 150 per cent Capital Investment Concessions for the investors for more than 100 million dollars.
Speaking to the media at the Ministry he said whoever the investor and according to the amount of the invest this Investment Concessions would be applicable.
Following the new IRA, the method had been stopped while treating each and every investor in equal manner with tax concessions.(Chaturanga Samarawickrama)

Israeli soldiers killed 16 Palestinians and wounded hundreds more

Gaza, (Daily Mail), 2 April, 2018 - Israel rejected calls for an independent probe on Sunday after its soldiers killed 16 Palestinians and wounded hundreds more when a major demonstration led to clashes along the border with the Gaza Strip.??
Israel?s military has faced questions from rights groups over its use of live fire on Friday, the bloodiest day in the conflict since a 2014 war, while Palestinians accused soldiers of firing on protesters posing no threat.??
On Friday, Israeli troops opened fire on Palestinians who strayed from a main protest camp attended by tens of thousands and approached the heavily fortified fence cutting off the blockaded Gaza Strip.??
Both UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and EU diplomatic chief Federica Mogherini have called for an independent investigation.??
On Saturday, the United States blocked a draft UN Security Council statement urging restraint and calling for an investigation of the violence, diplomats said.??
In addition to the 16 Palestinians killed, more than 1,400 were wounded Friday, 758 of them by live fire, with the remainder hurt by rubber bullets and tear gas inhalation, the health ministry in Gaza said.? No casualties were reported among Israelis.??
Unverified videos being shared online have fuelled the debate, including one appearing to show a protester running with a tyre being shot while seeming to pose no threat.??
Rights groups including Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch have criticised Israel?s use of live fire.??
?While some Palestinian demonstrators have thrown stones and other objects towards the fence, it?s hard to believe how this would be an imminent danger to the lives of well-equipped soldiers protected by snipers, tanks and drones,? Amnesty said.??

No Confidence Motion Trying to save Unity Government -Susil Premajayantha
	
?
The rule of the Unity Government which was formed in August 2015 will come to an end at 9.00 pm tomorrow if the NCM was beaten.
	The Government will lose over 35 members and there will be a new Government with a cabinet reduced to 30 ministers in such a scenario
	The limited mandate given in 2015 to the UNF does not exist after the February 10 LG polls.
	General Secretary of the SLFP, Minister Duminda Dissanayaka has to learn more politics and more governance because he has little experience. However, I have nothing personal against young Minister Duminda at all.
	The NCM is against the Prime Minister and the Government. Not against the President. Parliament means legislature and President means the Executive elected by the people at a?Presidential poll.
?
The Daily mirror? sat with Science, Technology and Research Minister Susil Premajayantha, to discuss the No-Confidence Motion and current politics in the country. Excerpts:
Q? Are you confident that the Joint Opposition could win the No Confidence Motion (NCM) against Prime Minister Mr Ranil Wickremesinghe on Wednesday?
This No Confidence Motion has been signed by the Joint Opposition members and a few other members of the Unity Government. Therefore, it is the duty of the SLFP members in the Unity Government to support the No Confidence Motion because 13 out of 14 allegations contained in the No Confidence Motion are based on the Central Bank bond scam and the other one is the failure of Prime Minister Mr Wickremesinghe to take prompt action as the then Minister of Law and Order to quell racial violence in Kandy in February.
Don?t forget that all these allegations on the bond scam were first raised by the nine-member SLFP Parliamentary Committee led by Transport and Civil Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala De Silva appointed by President Maithripala Sirisena in November 2016. In that context do you think any SLFP member whether he or she is in the Government or in the Opposition could oppose the NCM? I think No. And as such, I have no doubt whatsoever that we would win the NCM comfortably.
Q But in simple arithmetic, the JO could garner only the support of 55 members before submitting it to Speaker Karu Jayasuriya. Therefore, the JO will have to get the support of another 68 members to reach the simple majority of 113, while the UNF needs only the support of eight members to the target, except Speaker Karu Jayasuriya. Don?t you think this is an uphill task for the JO?
If you analyze the results of the last General Election (August 2015) you would see the party strength of each party has dramatically been changed by now. The limited mandate given in 2015 to the UNF does not exist after the February 10 LG polls.
In 2015, the UNF returned 106 members with the support of its constituent partners. Only 82 members were from the UNP while the UPFA won 95 seats with 82 from the SLFP. The TNA won 16 seats, JVP ? 6 seats, SLMC ? 1 and EPDP 1.
Up to date, the TNA has not declared its position on the NCM but the JVP and EPDP have said they would support it. Under this scenario, I am confident that we can win the NCM.
?Q What would be the position of SLFP Ministers in the ?Yahapalana Government? or in the Cabinet if the JO could not win the No Confidence Motion against Prime Minister with their support?
That is the end of the Unity Government at 9.00 p.m. tomorrow which was formed in August 2015. The Government will lose over 35 members and there will be a new Government with a Cabinet reduced to 30 ministers.
Please note that we have nothing against Mr Wickremesinghe personally but his policies and the style of his governance. What we are trying to do is to save the Unity Government by removing Mr Wickremesinghe from the Premiership.
Q Your struggle is to remove Mr Wickremesinghe from the Premiership. In the event of JO winning the No Confidence Motion, do you agree if Mr Wickremesinghe accepts a Cabinet portfolio under a different PM?
This struggle is not for victory for the JO but for the victory of the people who expressed their intentions very clearly at the February 10 Local Government polls. In that case, my opinion is that Prime Minister Mr Wickremesinghe should resign before the debate on the NCM is taken up tomorrow morning in Parliament.
Q Even the Ministry?of Finance?
Mr Wickremesinghe taking up the Finance Ministry under a new PM is not possible amidst the prevailing situation. Taking most of the functions of the Finance Ministry including the Central Bank under his purview is the main contributory factor that led to the bond scam. I presume that if Mr Wickremesinghe did not take the Central Bank under him in 2015, the bond scam would not have come about. Besides, President Maithripala Sirisena in a remedial measure has taken away most of the responsibilities connected with the MoF from Mr Wickremesinghe including the CB. In appointing a new Cabinet, I don?t think President Sirisena would agree to give the MoF to Mr Wickremesinghe.
??Q Minister Vajira Abeywardana says that under the 19th Amendment to the Constitution, a No Confidence Motion was not possible against the Prime Minister? As a lawyer and seasoned politician, what is your opinion on this remark?
Minister Vajira Abeywardana has not understood the relevant articles of the Constitution at all properly. Why did the Speaker accept the NCM and decide on a date for the debate after all?
I don?t want to talk much about the comments made by Minister Abeywardana. I invite him to have a look at our Constitution. For his convenience I would like to quote from Paragraph 42, 43,44 and 45 of the Sri Lanka Constitution as follows:
Chapter 46 clearly outlines how the Prime Minister can be removed and a new?PM appointed.
Chapter 45 says, there shall be a Cabinet of Ministers charged with the direction and control of the Government of the Republic. (2) The Cabinet of Ministers shall be collectively responsible and answerable to Parliament. (3) The President shall be a member of the Cabinet of Ministers and shall be the Head of the Cabinet of Ministers. (4) The President shall appoint as Prime Minister the Member of Parliament, who, in the President?s opinion, is most likely to command the confidence of Parliament. 43. (1) President shall, in consultation with the Prime Minister, where he considers such consultation to be necessary, determine the number of Ministers??
of the Cabinet of Ministers and the Ministries and the assignment of subjects and functions to such Ministers. (2) The President shall, on the advice of the Prime Minister, appoint from among Members of Parliament, Ministers, to be in the charge of the Ministries so determined. (3) The President may at any time change the assignment of subjects and functions and the composition of the Cabinet of Ministers. Such changes shall not affect the continuity of the Cabinet of Ministers and the continuity of its responsibility to Parliament. 44. (1) The President may, on the advice of the Prime Minister, appoint from among Members of Parliament, Ministers who shall not be members of the Cabinet of Ministers. (2) The President may, in consultation with the Prime Minister where he considers such consultation to be necessary, determine the assignment of subjects and functions to Ministers appointed under paragraph (1) of this Article and the Ministries, if any, which are to be in the charge of, such Ministers.
?
The President may at any time change any assignment made under paragraph (2). 31 - Chapter VIII was substituted by the Nineteenth Amendment to the Constitution Sec. 9 Prime Minister and the Cabinet of Ministers and their subjects and functions Ministers who are not members of the Cabinet of Ministers The Constitution of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka 41 (4) Every Minister appointed under paragraph (1) shall be responsible to the Cabinet of Ministers and to Parliament.
?
45. (1)The President may, on the advice of the Prime Minister, appoint from among Members of Parliament, Deputy Ministers to assist Ministers of the Cabinet of Ministers in the performance of their duties.
Q He also says that the No Confidence Motion was also against President Maithripala Sirisena. Your comments?
The NCM is against the Prime Minister and the Government. Not against the President. Parliament means legislature and President means the Executive elected by the people at a Presidential poll.
?Q You had a war of words recently with SLFP General Secretary, Agriculture Minister Duminda Dissanayaka. Have both of you got settled the issue?
General Secretary of the SLFP, Minister Duminda Dissanayaka has to learn more politics and more governance because he has little experience. However, I have nothing personal against young Minister Duminda at all.
Q The allegations against Mr Wickremesinghe in the No Confidence Motion are based mainly on the Central Bank bond scam. As far as you know, what is the correct amount of financial loss from this alleged fraud? I asked this question because several figures ranging from Rs. 10 billion to two or three trillion rupees have been mentioned as the total damage.
According to the Auditor General, the loss is Rs. 11.5 billion but the Commission of Inquiry (CoI) that probed the bond scandal has recommended a forensic auditing which would give us a clear picture of the actual damage done to the economy in the long run. The long-term negative effects to the economy have never been calculated and my gut feeling is that it will be colossal and much more than Rs. 11.5 billion.
?QHow is the preparation of the SLFP under President Maithripala Sirisena for the upcoming PC polls for Eastern, North - Central and Sabaragamuwa Provinces?
We are awaiting the Parliamentary debate on the delimitation on PCs to arrive at a final decision on how we face PC polls.

Opening a new  can of worms
	
Impeachment against India?s CJ indicates the need for judicial reforms
The dawn of 2018 saw the opening a new can of worms in India; namely, the issue of corruption and politicization afflicting the higher judiciary, including the Supreme Court.
On January 11, four senior Judges of the Supreme Court, Jasti Chelameswar, Ranjan Gogoi, M. B. Lokur and Kurien Joseph, suddenly addressed the media on the sordid state of affairs in the court which, if not attended to immediately, could lead to the collapse of democracy in the country, they warned.
The revolt was against Chief Justice Dipak Misra, who was accused of mishandling a matter relating to a former judge who had allegedly offered to bribe Supreme Court judges in a case Misra himself was presiding over.
Misra was not accused of taking bribes but was criticized for repeatedly intervening to ensure that only judges of his choice could hear the matter.
?One case cited by the four protesting Judges was a request for an independent investigation into the death of a Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) court judge, B. H. Loya, who was overseeing a case involving murder allegations against Amit Shah, President of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP),? The Guardian reported. ?Media reports had raised suspicions over Loya?s death and the possibility of Shah?s involvement though a court had cleared Shah?s name,? the paper said.
The letter to Chief Justice Misra, which the four protesting judges released to the media, said:
?There have been instances where cases having far-reaching consequences for the nation and the institution had been assigned by the Chief Justice of this court selectively to the benches of their preference without any rationale for this assignment. This must be guarded against at all costs.?
Asked by journalists if the Chief Justice should be impeached, judge Chelameswar said: ?Let the nation decide that.? And he closed the dramatic press conference by saying: ?We don?t want wise men saying 20 years from now that justice Chelameswar, Gogoi, Lokur and Kurian Joseph sold their souls and didn?t do the right thing by our constitution.?
However, Misra claimed that, as Chief Justice, he has the right to decide the ?roster? of Judges (the list of Judges who will hear a given case). But the protesting Judges said that this could not be a cover to manipulate the system for personal or political purposes and sought an overhaul of the system.
Legal watchdog?s petition
Subsequently, Prashant Bhushan, a Supreme Court lawyer and Convener of ?Campaign for Judicial Accountability and Reforms? filed a complaint in the court against Misra in the ?medical college scam? case and requested five senior-most judges, including the four rebel judges, to hold an in-house inquiry into the matter.
Bhushan levelled the following charges against the Chief Justice in his complaint addressed to Justices J. Chelameswar, Ranjan Gogoi, Madan B. Lokur and Kurian Joseph:
The facts and circumstances relating to the Prasad Education Trust (Medical College) case show prima facie evidence suggesting that the Chief Justice of India (CJI) Misra may have been involved in the conspiracy of paying illegal gratification in the case, which at least warrants a thorough investigation.
M. Quddusi, a retired Judge of the Orissa High Court was arrested by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and later granted bail in this case. Prasad Education Trust was barred by the Medical Council of India from admitting students. The trust subsequently appealed to the Allahabad High Court and the Supreme Court.
Bhushan also questioned Chief Justice Misra?s denial of permission to the CBI to register a case against Justice Narayan Shukla of the Allahabad High Court in the Prasad Education Trust matter.
Bhushan?s second charge was the alleged misuse of administrative powers by Misra when he ignored the clear principle of ?conflict of interest? and proceeded with the hearing of a petition for an independent inquiry by a former Chief Justice of India into the irregularities in the Prasad Education Trust.
After hearing the petition himself, Misra nullified the order of another bench headed by Justice Chelameswar who had ordered the matter to be listed before five senior Judges of the Supreme Court. But the Chief Justice Misra constituted a three-Judge bench to hear the petition. The bench later dismissed the plea filed by Bhushan?s NGO, Campaign for Judicial Accountability and Reforms.
Bhushan also alleged that Justice Misra ?conducted a serious act of forgery by ante-dating an administrative order dated 6 November 2017?.
The Supreme Court advocate also alleged that ?Justice Misra, as a lawyer, acquired land for a fodder farm in Odisha by furnishing a false affidavit?. Later, the land deal was cancelled by a local Magistrate in 1985.
Bhushan?s 24-page complaint said: ?The above-mentioned matters have tarnished the reputation of the court and have brought the judiciary into disrepute. It is a matter which needs to be swiftly dealt with.
The inquiry must be swiftly done so that the reputation of the judiciary is not damaged further and its integrity and independence remain intact.?
Move to impeach CJ
A month elapsed before further action was taken on the issue of cleaning up the highest rung of the judiciary. Sensing the growing unpopularity of the BJP government, following the BJP?s loses in crucial by-elections in populous North India, the opposition parties took up the issue.
Led by the two Communist parties, other opposition parties including the Congress, are on the verge of submitting an impeachment motion to the Chairman of the Upper House of parliament (Rajya Sabha) and India?s Vice President, Venkiah Naidu.
The draft impeachment motion as seen by The Citizen makes five charges against the Chief Justice. They are as follows:
1. The facts and circumstances relating to the Prasad Educational Trust case, show prima facie evidence suggesting that Chief Justice Dipak Misra may have been involved in the conspiracy of paying illegal gratification in the case, which at least warrants a thorough investigation.
2. That Chief Justice Misra allegedly dealt on the administrative as well as judicial side, with a writ petition which sought investigation into a matter in which he too was likely to fall within the scope of investigation since he had presided over every bench which had dealt with the case and passed orders in the case of Prasad Educational Trust, and thus violated the first principle of the Code of Conduct for Judges.
3. That the Chief Justice Misra appears to have antedated an administrative order dated 6th November 2017 which amounts to a serious act of forgery/fabrication.
4. That Chief Justice Misra allegedly acquired land when he was an advocate, by giving an affidavit that was reportedly found to be false and allegedly (despite the orders of the Additional District Magistrate cancelling the allotment in 1985), surrendered the said land only in 2012 after he was elevated to the Supreme Court.
5. That Chief Justice Dipak Misra has (allegedly) abused his administrative authority as master of the roster to (allegedly) arbitrarily assign individual cases of particular advocates in politically sensitive cases, to select judges in order to achieve a predetermined outcome (this is apparently the case about judge Loya?s death)
It remains to be seen if the charges hold scrutiny, and whether the chairman of the Rajya Sabha, who is a hardcore BJP man, will admit the impeachment motion. Even if he admits, it has to be sent to a panel of three, including a judge of the Supreme Court, a Chief Justice of any High Court and a ?distinguished jurist.?
Once the committee gives the green signal for impeachment, the impeachment motion will have to be carried by a two-thirds majority with at least 50% of the members of the two Houses of Parliament present and voting.
This is a tall order which also takes a long time. But time is short as Justice Misra retires in October this year on reaching 65.
At the moment the ruling BJP has the numbers in parliament to defeat the motion. But the movers of the motion argue that the impeachment debate is an opportunity to focus on the chronic ills of the judiciary and expose the sinister links between the BJP government and the higher judiciary.

Police seize night racing motorcycle gang in Colombo 7
	
A gang of young riders who rode high powered racing motorcycles with engines beyond the legal capacity with altered chassis numbers on the main roads in Colombo 7 early on Friday night was seized by the Cinnamon Gardens Police.
A team of officials from the police traffic control branch armed with information based on several public complaints launched a special operation past midnight to nab the gang of motorcyclists on Reid Avenue.
The police team led by Cinnamon Gardens Police Traffic Branch Sub Inspector Suraj Abeysekara said, about ten motorcyclists were taken into custody for riding unlawful motorcycles that violated the rules of Department of Motor Traffic pertaining to bikes in Sri Lanka.
Most of the engine and chassis numbers of the seized motorcycles had been tampered with as they were illegally assembled in the country against the DMT rules.
Among the apprehended motorcycles were powerful trail bikes such Kawasaki, Hornet, Yamaha that exceeded the engine capacities beyond 250cc up to 400cc and 600cc.
?The bikes had been modified with various body kits and silencer beat boxes that created an excessive high pitched noises causing great disturbance to the public, especially riding in groups in the late hours,? the SI said.
The apprehended riders had been released on police bail and were asked to return with the registration books of their motorcycles.
The DMT officials had inspected the bikes and a report was to be handed over to the police which will be sent to the Government Analyst for further clarification of their unlawful engine accessories.
ASP Colombo City Traffic Central Lucien Suriyabandara told the Daily Mirror that Colombo police stations had been given explicit instructions to track down these unlawful motorcyclists who ride falsely registered bikes in a reckless manner and causing great disturbance to the public at night.
?These gangs traverse to and fro on the straight stretches of city roads like Reid Avenue and Green Path, where illegal night racing was an infestation several years back,? he said.
OIC Cinnamon Gardens Traffic Branch IP Indika Kumara and SI Suraj Abeysekara are conducting further inquiries on the instructions of ASP Lucien Suriyabandara.(Kurulu Koojana Kariyakarawana, Pics by Kushan Pathiraja)

Proposed NGO Act   Shocks  and stuns civil society
	
Minister Mano Ganesan promises to withdraw it; committee to be set up to review issues
The funding agencies are also very eager to see the organizations registered so the activities of the NGOs are looked into and monitored??
	The draft amendment restricts constitutionally guaranteed rights such as the freedom of association, freedom of assembly and the freedom of expression.
	?
	Financial scrutiny for transactions over Rs. 1 million as grants coming in and for any transaction of the prescribed amount.
	Citizens get together and have fundraising events for social welfare. But if this amendment is implemented you cannot form such groups for such purposes
?
In a bid to regulate, supervise and inspect Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) the Government introduced a draft legislation to amend the Voluntary Social Service Organizations (Registration and Supervision) Act, No 31 of 1980 and the draft had received Cabinet approval.? However, the draft amendment was subjected to severe criticism and civil society vehemently opposed it.
As a result, the Minister of National Co-existence Dialogue and Official Languages Mano Ganesan, in the presence of civil society representatives last week promised to withdraw it.??
The Prime Minister was also in attendance. Accordingly, a committee is to be set up which will include civil society representatives. However, civil society activists stressed that NGOs should not be targeted and if there are any allegations of malpractices within NGOs, existing laws could be used to deal with them.??
Shocked and Stunned??
At a press conference organized by the Collective of Civil Society Organizations Executive Director of the Center for Policy Alternatives (CPA) and a Co-Convener of the Platform for Freedom, Dr Paikiasothy Saravanamuttu, said that civil society was ?shocked? and ?stunned? that such a Cabinet paper could be presented and endorsed by the Government.??
?
?
?The effect of the Cabinet Paper was to consider legislation that was so extensive and comprehensive in terms of all civil society actors,? he said.??
He said the restrictions envisaged by the amendment would have had a chilling effect on civil society and would run completely contrary to the promises and commitments made by the Government with respect?to governance.
Executive Secretary of Right to Life Philip Dissanayake said that the amendment went against the principles upheld by civil society and even the current Government.??
?
Compulsory for NGOs to be registered??
Currently, the National Secretariat For Non-Governmental Organizations is under the purview of the Ministry of National Coexistence, Dialogue, and?
Official Languages.??
The draft amendment seen by the??makes it compulsory for all NGOs operating in Sri Lanka to be registered.??
Critics of the draft amendment point out that on one hand NGOs already registered under various categories such as a non-profit organization, a Trust, under the Ministry of Social Welfare, or under the Pradeshiya Sabha were required under the suggested amendment to re-register under the?NGO Secretariat.??
On the other hand, they point out that there was no necessity to make registration under the Secretariat compulsory unless a particular NGO collaborated with the Government for its activities.?
?
?
?In some areas, citizens get together and have fundraising events for social welfare. But if this amendment is implemented you cannot form such groups for such purposes,? pointed out the Executive Director of People?s Action for Free and Fair Elections (PAFFREL), Rohana Hettiarachchi.
? The draft amendment also bars an NGO from changing its name, rules governing the NGO, amending the constitution and establishing branch offices or subsidiary NGOs without the written approval of the National Secretariat for NGOs.
Hettiarachchi said that when disasters struck the country, it was the civil society that responded promptly in?providing relief.??
?We helped those devastated by the tsunami clean their houses and rebuild houses. But our mandate does not state that we can do such activities,? he said adding that if the amendment under scrutiny today was in existence at that time, civil society would not have been able to assist as promptly as they did, as they would have had to seek?approval beforehand.??
Constitutionally guaranteed rights restricted??
?
?
Meanwhile, the President of Families of the Disappeared Brito Fernando said that civil society was not against introducing new legislation per se, but Constitutionally guaranteed rights should not be violated.?
?Attorney-at-Law Ermiza Tegal said that the draft amendment posed restrictions on Constitutionally guaranteed rights such as the freedom of association, freedom of assembly and the freedom of expression.
?The draft amendment sought to define Non-Governmental Organizations in the broadest possible sense and would have applied from village level societies to unregistered associations, to guaranteed limited companies, to social enterprises and also to corporate foundations,??
she said.??
National Secretariat for NGOs??
According to the draft amendment the NGO Secretariat is able to investigate complaints of misconduct in NGOs, criminal activities including terrorist financing and money laundering.? The Secretariat also has the powers to enter and inspect premises of NGOs.? ?Further, the Secretariat can obtain information related to financial activities of NGOs from banks.??
Tegal said the draft law gave extraordinary Police powers to the NGO Secretariat for search and seizure.??
?It has introduced financial scrutiny for transactions over Rs. 1 million as grants coming in and for any transaction of the prescribed amount. The bank would have to notify the NGO Secretariat.
?Further offences have been introduced for NGOs for actions, such as non-registration, not giving a publication of the organization and not providing information, that could have been administratively corrected,? she said. Asked if NGOs should be regulated at least to a certain extent she said it depended on the type of regulation that was in discussion. ?If it is regarding financial mismanagement, fraud, corruption, terrorist financing there are regulations already in existence. You can make complaints to the Police. The Police can investigate and the Attorney General?s Department can prosecute,? she said.
?There is no need to specifically target and hamper the functioning of individuals who want to get together and form associations and NGOs. There are laws domestically that look at various kinds of wrongdoings and NGOs are subject to the same laws. NGOs are not special categories,? she said.??
She further said the NGO Secretariat under the existing Act has no legal status which was also problematic.??
?But it functions, issue circulars and regulations and puts various conditions on various organizations. This has been a problematic trend. At the District level organizations are being compelled to give their work plans, and invite the District Secretariat to their various events.?
?This also leads to opportunities for corruption,? she pointed out.? Tegal also said Police powers to enter organizations, to take copies of documents are found in the existing law as well. ?The draft amendment has allocated these same powers to the NGO Secretariat,? she told?the .??
No consultations??
?
?
Nishantha Prithviraj of the Sarvodaya Shramadana Movement said that the proposed draft amendment weakened people?s sovereignty.
? He pointed out the draft amendment was drafted without consulting civil society and was an injustice to civil society and the public at large.
?He said existing laws could be used to deal with malpractices within organizations if there were any.??
NGOs perceived with suspicion??
NGOs have been viewed at with scepticism and suspicion due to perceptions created of their non-national nature resulting from their dependency on international funds. In 2008, a Parliamentary Select Committee headed by Vijitha Herath of the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) was appointed to investigate the operations of NGOs and their impact on sovereignty and national security.
Reports state that after the war, the Government suspicions of NGOs increased with international advocacy groups lobbying against Sri Lanka.??
?
?
Under the previous regime, the NGO Secretariat was brought under the purview of the Defence Ministry and there were attempts to regulate NGOs.??
For instance, a circular was introduced to control NGOs. Brito Fernando said that civil society activists gathered and burnt the circular in front of the Fort Railway Station manifesting their opposition.??
?The circular was neither withdrawn nor implemented,? he said.??
Fernando said he was surprised when the current draft amendment was introduced as the Prime Minister and Minister Mano Ganesan had often worked closely with the civil society.??
Accounts Audited??
Time and again critics have questioned the manner in which funds obtained by NGOs were utilized, and whether there has been any fraud or misappropriation of the funds received.??
In response to a question posed by journalists, Rohana Hettiarachchi said that NGOs audited their accounts annually.??
?NGOs registered under the Companies Act, the Social Services Department, or the District Secretariats provide records to the respective authorities,? he said.??
?So, every fund we receive is audited.???
Fernando added that NGOs provide audited reports and the Government had the power and right to question them.??
Draft Amendment to be withdrawn??
Following discussions with the Prime Minister and Minister Mano Ganesan last week, the draft amendment has?been suspended.??
When the? contacted Minister Mano Ganesan, he confirmed that he would withdraw the draft amendment.??
Meanwhile, he tweeted that a committee was proposed with civil society members and officials from the NGO Secretariat to revisit the ?necessities? for new legislation and formulate means to address issues.??
Dr Saravanamuttu said that civil society activists were given a commitment last week that no legislation would be based on the proposed draft amendment.??
?We agreed, therefore, to meet with them to discuss and explore the need for any further regulation. In fact, if there is a need for a legislative amendment, it is to strengthen the freedom of association rather than restrict it in the way that is identified in this cabinet paper,? he said.??
Need for Amendment??
Speaking to the? the Director General of the NGO Secretariat Shakya Nanayakkara said the draft amendment sought to include suggestions made by the Central Bank and the Ministry of Justice.??
Asked why the amendment was needed he said Sri Lanka was a signatory to International Conventions which deal with issues such as money laundering and financing terrorism.??
?Secondly, companies have legal personalities. But the NGO Secretariat does not have a legal personality under the existing Act. So, certain issues cropped up when initiating legal proceedings,? he said adding that the amendment, proposed to make the Secretariat a legal personality. He said the advice of the Attorney General?s Department and other Government institutes was to strengthen the NGO Secretariat as it was the body that registers NGOs.? Stressing the importance of registering NGOs Nanayakkara said that an NGO became a legal entity through registration.??
?
?
?The funding agencies are also very eager to see the organizations registered so the activities of the NGOs are looked into and monitored,? he added.? He said that the draft amendment mandates the registration be issued within three months. ?Previously, the registration process took two-and-a-half-years to three years. But the draft Amendment states that the Registrar has to issue the registration within three months,? he said. He also said that no proposed legislation could contradict prevailing Constitutional provisions such as Article 14, which among many freedoms, guarantees the freedom of association.? ?However, he said that civil society itself was divided on this issue.??
?Development Organizations want the Government assistance and support. They report to the Government Agents and they work with the Government structures. Advocacy organizations want a more liberal process. So, we have to find a middle path,? he said.??

Ravi Jayewardene:  Unchanging, simple, straight-forward and compassionate
	
One year ago on this date, Ravi Jayewardene, only son of late President of Sri Lanka J.R. Jayewardene passed away. Among his many achievements, Ravi Jayewardene was a lifelong Buddhist meditator. In acknowledgement of his life and legacy, his son Rukshan Jayewardene, Conservationist, shares his personal tribute, as spoken at the funeral on behalf of the family, shortly before his father?s cremation on April 6, 2017:
?Today, we are gathered here to witness the cremation of my beloved father Ravi Jayewardene.? ?
This is a day I have dreaded since the age of 16, when I shook hands with him and became reacquainted after a separation of nearly six years. Our father-son relationship was re-established. That day, I decided to grab hold of this man who was like quicksilver and never let go. Like most books are judged by their cover, people judge others by externalities. My father had many facets, not many faces. So many people knew him in many different areas of his life and at many different times during his 80 years of existence on this earth.? ?
?
Today, I have the strength of my convictions that transcend mere mundane considerations and the satisfaction and lack of regret of a son who has done his duty by his father, as much as is humanly possible
?One thing everybody knew about Ravi Jayewardene that was unchanging, was his simple, straight-forward compassionate self. Unfortunately, he was much misunderstood in his lifetime but simple folk in far away places knew him best. He was not the perfect father, but who is? He was not the perfect husband, but who is? And who are we to judge? In this worldly existence, there is no absolute perfection. Only in relative terms is there something approaching it. Within that framework, he was a perfectionist. He was a fierce patriot, but was loved by people of all ethnic groups within this island of ours and beyond.??
During his lifetime, he never received the respect and honour he deserved, due to his reticent nature. Others however took advantage of his noble qualities. Anyway, at least in this last hour of his corporeal remains on earth, the Special Task Force (STF) that he created and gifted to this nation has taken upon itself to give this man his due.? ?
?
This is a day I have dreaded since the age of 16, when I shook hands with him and became reacquainted after a separation of nearly six years. Our father-son relationship was re-established
?In 1982, I was down in the Welikanda area, involved with a census and assessment of the elephant population of the Eastern Province. I was the most junior member of the team. One member was an old friend of my father?s and we got talking. In my youthful enthusiasm, I blurted out that I considered my father to be a greater man than my grandfather (although I loved both very much and owed the former far more than my own father). This friend of my father scolded me severely for making such a statement. Chastised, I fell silent, although I never changed my mind.? ?
?Today, I have the strength of my convictions that transcend mere mundane considerations and the satisfaction and lack of regret of a son who has done his duty by his father, as much as is humanly possible. Life often doesn?t give us these second chances.? ?
May he attain the Nibbana that he so richly deserves.???

Royden O. Gibbs, a gifted artist, has marvellously captured many historical places of Sri Lanka through his art. As an individual interested in history, architecture and humanity he gives us a glimpse of past glories, some of which unfortunately have disappeared over time.
?He has an impressive collection of paintings of lighthouses from all across Sri Lanka. He was also the first artist to travel to the north-east during the war, to capture unique perspectives even during such turbulent times. An unassuming individual who makes friends wherever he goes, he is invariably mistaken for a tourist when he travels across the country.? ?
Gibbs has been passing on his passion for art to many students throughout the years. He is helping his current students organize an exhibition of their paintings which will be held at the Alliance Francaise, opening on April 5, 2018, at 6.00 pm. The exhibition will be open to the public from April 6 - 9 from 9.00 am to 6.00 pm.? ?
Below are some of the students in their own words;? ?
?I am told that I had a love for art in my early school years. About five years ago, I was told that art would help alleviate my stressful lifestyle. After some guidance from great Royden Gibbs, I finally started painting. Did it help with my stress...? Yes... it did. Now that I am retired, I hope to spend a little more time in this pursuit. However, I guess I?ll continue to be a dilettante as far as art goes! Let?s see where this takes me.? - Lal Chandranath? ?
?Coming from a family of artists who dabbled in art at different points in their lives, it was very much instilled in me that I could draw. My uncle, the late Asoka A. Gunawardhana, was my first teacher. Since then I have studied under many great teachers, but never had enough time to settle down to finish a collection of paintings worth exhibiting, until I met my excellent teacher?Royden Gibbs.?
Watercolour is a wonderful medium and I am thoroughly enjoying myself.? - Veeranthi Wijemanne? ?
?The distinctive ability acquired throughout my career as an architect, to feel and perceive inner splendour and reality, inspired me to create this series of landscapes. Besides, I find that sitting still in a site, admiring minuscule details and painting with watercolour on a blank paper for hours is the perfectly tested method of relaxation for myself, as well as the ultimate cure for my soul. Thus, through my work I wish not only to initiate a spark in people?s heart to appreciate the genuine inward significance of everything in our lives, but also to gift them a sense of peace and well-being.? - Keshani de Silva? ?
?
I found art as precious and valuable as emeralds and dearer than fine opals. It was a pleasure for me to sit the green and watch the sun in his chariot of gold. Hats off and dearest thanks to my master Royden Gibbs
?Art had been a distant dream for me being a mother of three sons, while working full time. Long have I wished to pursue my dream as an artist, until I was introduced to Royden Gibbs by my friend Ms. Mendis. I was very inspired by him and his work. I joined his class four months ago. I somehow manage to find time for painting and as the old saying goes, better late than sorry.? - Renuka Mendis? ?
?In 2017, I won an international award ? the Toyota Dream Car silver medal in Japan. That was a wonderful moment in my life. I found art as precious and valuable as emeralds and dearer than fine opals. It was a pleasure me to sit the green and watch the sun in his chariot of gold. Hats off and dearest thanks to my master Royden Gibbs.? - Hansaja Devnith? ?
?I have always been very much interested in art, especially watercolours. Under the guidance of my teacher Roydon Gibbs I am learning the use of different techniques and this has been very useful for me since I am doing art as a subject in school. Art has made me look at things from a different perspective. I have learned to be more observant of little things, be it the colour of the sky or cloud formations or shadows etc.? - Malinka Samarasinha? ?
?I was interested in art from a very young age. My interest in art was rekindled under the guidance of Roydon Gibbs. I am mainly interested in learning the different techniques in watercolour, which is a very interesting and challenging medium. I have done a few still life and landscapes in watercolour and hope to expand to other mediums in the future. Getting involved in art has made me observe and appreciate the things around me, especially nature, in a more detailed way.? - Dharsha Samarasinha? ?
?Over the past 29 years I made a name for myself in the field of print media and have won several awards as a political cartoonist and as a newspaper and graphics designer. One of my childhood dreams was to become a top class painter and to achieve this dream I sought guidance from the legendary painter Roydon Gibbs a few years ago. This marks the first time that some of my work will be on display in an exhibition.? - Wasantha K. Siriwardena? ?
?
?
?I have always been interested in art/paint/colour. But I had really never thought about learning it, until my children left home and I had time on my hands. I was introduced to Royden Gibbs by a former student of his. He has encouraged and guided me to paint, and mostly to have the confidence to express myself.? - Manel Ratnayake? ?
My very first teacher was Mrs. Lathifa Ismail and I am very grateful to her. While going through a turbulent period in life, art gave me the peace and quiet I needed. I was introduced to Royden Gibbs, who inspired me to improve myself with his passion for art and his enthusiasm. Art is the best stress reliever and gives me lots of joy and happiness.? - Dianthi Uragoda? ?
?

?I had a desire for art from my school days, having won the college art prize in 1961, at S. Thomas? College, Gurutalawa. I continued to further enhance my abilities by joining the then famous Amarasekera Academy of Art. After three decades, I had a fortuitous meeting with Royden Gibbs at an art exhibition. Under his inspiring tutelage I have happily started painting again.? - Gamini Fernando? ?
I found that art is a cohesive medium that permeates across geographies, cultures and ethnicities ? a common language that binds humanity. My desire to learn to draw stems from a passion to capture and share the extraordinary beauty found in the detail of what cursorily seems mundane and ordinary. I feel blessed to have the opportunity to train under Roydon Gibbs, one of the best water colourists of our time, and is determined to make the best of it.? - Lilani de Silva? ?

Now the lodge authorities are finalizing arrangements to admit their affluent patient to a paying ward in a leading government hospital. Meanwhile, it is heard on the grapevine that bucks in millions are being pumped into proper channels to get the transfer to the paying ward expedited.

Addressing a media briefing, he said Premier Wickremesinghe had reportedly requested President Maithripala Sirisena to delay the Parliamentary debate on the NCM during his discussions with the President
He added the President had refused the request and asked to carry out the debate as scheduled.
?In such a scenario, the PM must have been desperate and trying to delay the Parliamentary session. Sources say that the UNP members are in an attempt to delay it at least until the Sinhala and Tamil New Year. We urged the Speaker to stand his ground and not to let detractors delay the session,?

The President arranged such bilateral talks for today after a special meeting he had with a top level UNP delegation at his official residence yesterday evening.
At yesterday's meeting, the President reportedly asked the UNP not to take the no confidence motion lightly. He said the chance for the Prime Minister to survive the motion was only 50 percent.
Therefore, he said he would have to take alternative steps for running the government for the remaining period. A Minister who attended the meeting said the President asked the UNP to submit a programme of work for this purpose .
Also, he said three schools of thought were prevailing in his SLFP regarding the motion. He said one section was trying to support the motion and another to vote against it. Alongside, he said there was a third group insisting to abstain from voting.
It is learnt that the two party delegations will weigh the current circumstances and decide on the next course of action.(Kelum Bandara and Yohan Perera)

Will radically modify IRA when we come to power: JO
	
The joint opposition (JO) today said it would radically modify the new Inland Revenue Act (IRA) and other such Acts when it comes to power, to provide benefits to the people instead of suppressing them.
Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) Chairman G.L. Peiris said the new IRA would result in grave repercussions as those who depend on the interest of their deposits would be affected drastically by it.
Meanwhile, he said the government?s inefficiency has created an inauspicious era in the country and that this era would end after the no-confidence motion against Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe is passed.
?The ambiguousness and the lack of order had resulted in chaos in the country. The President was hell-bent on dissolving the Economic Management Committee but it is still intact. The Health Minister wanted to ban Glyphosate while another minister is against the ban,? he told a news briefing.
Addressing the news briefing, MP Bandula Gunawardana said one of the very first decisions of a JO government would be amending the IRA. ?We will amend this Act based on just?policies,? he said.
He said the previous Mahinda Rajapaksa government had provided tax relief to the people but these relief measures were taken away by the government.?We have to do away with oppressive tax policies. The JO will restructure the tax collecting system to suit the times,? he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Yarl Med Ex 2018:  Towards new horizons in healthcare
	
From April 4 to 7 at the Jaffna University Medical Faculty
?
To mark its 40th anniversary, students of the Jaffna University Medical Faculty have organised an exhibition titled ?Yarl Med Ex 2018? which is scheduled to be held from April 4 to 7 at the faculty premises. The exhibition is co-sponsored by the Health Ministry (Northern Province) and local and international chapters of the Alumni Association in partnership with the event management company, ?Evolution.?? ?
The Medical Faculty has played a pioneering role in introducing medical exhibitions to the Northern Province and this year?s exhibition will set the platform to raise awareness and dialogue on health issues faced by the Northerners. While shedding light on recent developments in the health sector, the exhibition will provide opportunities for school-goers and school-leavers to explore career opportunities in the fast-growing health sector. The latter is of pivotal significance to the province, given the dearth of healthcare professionals. The exhibition will be held in Vanni in October in a bid to create awareness in remote areas.?
Furthermore, ?Yarl Med Ex 2018? will address the following key thematic areas: basic sciences, career guidance, current challenges in health, recent advances and future directions in medicine and health across the life cycle. The last consists of four stages addressing child, adolescent, adult and elder health. Unlike the traditional format that centres on various disciplines in medicine, the exhibition takes a crosscutting approach to highlighting priority issues in the North.?
The exhibition boasts a number of attractions. The basic sciences and career guidance areas target A/L students and school-leavers. Among the highlights are hologram displays of 3D images of the human body, cadaver specimens and an application to assist students in making career decisions. Among other displays, the current challenges zone addresses road accidents and features numerous non-communicable disease prevention strategies including a section devoted to organic farming.?
The recent advances zone introduces nanotechnology and robotics, including nanotechnology for cancer therapy, the Da Vinci robotic guided laparoscopy system and 3D printed prosthetics. Finally, the zones addressing health across the life cycle feature opportunities for non-communicable disease screening, including bio-impedance analysis to measure body fat and health education on cancer prevention. Other contemporary social issues with wide-ranging implications for healthcare including child abuse, gender-based violence and substance abuse will be covered, as relevant to each age group. A section is dedicated to elder care, given the growing aging population in the Northern? Province, which has seen mass out-migration.?
?
A key objective of the exhibition is to create opportunities for students to express their creativity while developing team spirit and honing leadership and communication skills
A key objective of the exhibition is to create opportunities for students to express their creativity while developing team spirit and honing leadership and communication skills. Towards this goal, Yarl Med Ex 2018 is jointly organised by medical students and students of the Allied Health Science Unit. Notably, this inter-disciplinary approach emphasizes the value of inter-professional collaboration in the health sector, sadly lacking today.?
?
?
The exhibition has been integrated into the undergraduate medical curriculum as a ?Field Health Activity,? a core requirement in Community Medicine. The ?Field Health Activity? is essentially a community-based health promoting activity carried out by medical students in year four of the undergraduate programme. While such activities have been undertaken both individually and collectively in yester years, Yarl Med Ex 2018 will constitute a collective Field Health Activity for the 36th batch of medical students, who are collaborating with junior and senior colleagues of the Medical Faculty and the Unit of Allied Health Sciences.?
Charles Camilas, President of the Student Organising Committee, is playing a steering role in the exhibition. According to Charles, the students initially took on the exhibition purely as an academic activity, but they have since come to realise its value in creating sustained ?connections and memories? by bringing students together. Charles also speaks of the heart-warming response received from A/L students in the Northern Province, to essay and art competitions organised parallel to the exhibition.?
Brintha Suseendran, Secretary, appreciates the hard work put in by colleagues of her faculty as well as other faculties (especially Fine Arts, Architecture and Engineering of the Jaffna University, Eastern? University and the University? of Moratuwa). She also highlights the support students received from academic staff, sponsors and well-wishers.?
?
Geerthana Nagenthiran, Treasurer, echoes these sentiments adding that she feels privileged that her batch was given the opportunity to be a part of this historic event and make a contribution to societal well-being.?
The students are ably supported by the Chair of the Exhibition Committee, Dr. R. Surenthirakumaran, Senior Lecturer and Head/Community and Family Medicine and his team of academic staff in the Organising Committee. Dr. S. Raviraj, Dean, Faculty of Medicine, has provided sustained leadership to the event with support from Prof. R. Vigneswaran, Vice Chancellor, Jaffna University. Financial assistance from the Northern Provincial Council and the Health Ministry (Northern Province) has made this medical exhibition a reality.?
We welcome participants from across the island to make this historic event a resounding success.?
