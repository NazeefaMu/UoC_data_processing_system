Airline agrees to settle all outstandings: Kiriella
	
In response to threats by the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) to stop the supply of aviation fuel on credit to SriLankan Airlines, Public Enterprise Development Minister Lakshman Kiriella said the national carrier had agreed to settle all overdue payments amounting to more than Rs.1 billion. However, he said the payments would be phased out or carried out on a staggered basis.
Mr. Kiriella told Daily Mirror that he would discuss this matter with the relevant authorities in an effort to sort it out.
He said his ministry had planned to restructure the national carrier.
?I will discuss it with the Cabinet when it meets on today. I have informed the CPC authorities of our plan to curtail overall expenditures of the national career. We will close flight operations on unprofitable routes,? the minister said. (Kelum Bandara)

Ajith P. challenges MR to sue NY Times
	
State Minister of Power and Renewable Energy, Ajith P Perera today challenged former president Mahinda Rajapaksa to sue The New York Times if its June 25 article alleging that his presidential election campaign being funded by a Chinese company,?was a fabrication.
"This is a golden opportunity for Mr. Rajapaksa to become the richest person in Sri Lanka if he proves in a US court that the China Harbour Engineering Company (CHEC) had provided US$7.6 million was baseless," he said.
He told a news briefing that in the US character assassination was a serious matter and the US judiciary awards victims of mud-slinging the full amount they request as compensation.
Therefore, as a former president and a prominent politician, Mr. Rajapaksa would not find it difficult to sue the US newspaper at least for US$1 billion.
?What is the truth behind this sordid episode??We have reason to believe that Mr. Rajapaksa's election campaign was funded by the Chinese company because this company had not rejected the allegations published in the NYT. We also saw?how Mr. Rajapaksa's campaign team distributed money, gifts and held thamashas during the campaign. They have not disclosed the origin of the funding,? the minister said.
To a question asked by the Daily Mirror why the government remained silent if law enforcement authorities had launched an inquiry, he said the FCID, CID or the Bribery Commission could not disclose information on their investigations to the public.
The minister said it was the responsibility of the Yahapalana government to get to the bottom of this disclosure and take action against the culprits and that it was now Mr. Rajapaksa's responsibility to prove his innocence.
?As long as he does not prove his innocence we have no option but to assume that Mr. Rajapaksa mortgaged national assets to China for political expediency,? he said. (Sandun A Jayasekera)

Avant Garde case: Counsel points out disparity in Bribery Act
	
Raising an unexpected legal argument, President?s Counsel Romesh de Silva said today the order given by the High Court Judge in the Avant Garde corruption case filed against former defence secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa and others could not stand because the Judge had interpreted a none existing section of the Bribery Act.
Earlier, when the Bribery Commission (BC) filed the corruption case against the suspects in the Chief Magistrate?s Court, the defense said under the section 78 (1) of the Bribery Act there was a need for a written sanction by the BC to institute such an action by the prosecution, therefore the case should be dismissed.
However, this argument was overruled by the Chief Magistrate and resulted in the defense filing a revision application in the High Court against the Chief Magistrate?s order.
The High Court Judge too referring to Section 78 of the Bribery Act rejected argument by the defense.
Consequently, the defense filed a revision application in the Court of Appeal against the High Court order.
Bringing a whole new aspect into the defense argument, Counsel Romesh de Silva PC challenged the High Court Judge?s order.
He said while the High Court Judge was interpreting section 78 of the Bribery Act (upon which the defense?s legal argument is based on), he had referred to a section which did not exist as law.
Counsel said Section 78 was existed since 1954 in the Country?s Bribery Act. Then in 1980 through an amendment to the Act (No: 2, 1980 Amendment Bribery Act) the section 78 had been removed and introduced a new Section to it.
He said this resulted in the amended Section being established as law until another amendment introduced to the Bribery Act which came into effect in 1994 (No: 20, Amendment Bribery Act).
Counsel said the 1994 amendment of Section 78 had also included an amendment to a phrase which was not there in the 1980 amendment and therefore the 1994 amendment is wrong and was of the view that therefore the consolidated Bribery Act upon which the High Court Judge had given his order was wrong in law.
In view of the submissions made by Counsel Romesh de Silva PC on the issue of law, Senior State Counsel Janaka Bandara appearing for the Attorney General pleaded time to study the disparities in detail.
Court fixed the matter for tomorrow for further submissions whereas the High Court trial has been fixed for July 9.
The Counsel informed Court that he would support for notice and interim relief on that date.
Romesh de Silva PC with M.U.M. Ali Sabry PC, Sugath Caldera, Ruwantha Cooray and Farith de Mel instructed by Sanath Wijewardane appeared for Mr. Rajapaksa.
He filed the revision application in the Court of Appeal based on the High Court rejecting his application which seeks to acquit and release him in the Avant Garde case.
He cited Director General of the Bribery Commission as complainant-respondent and Sujatha Damayanthi Jayaratne, Piyasiri Fernando, Banda Fernando Egodawela, Somathilake Dissanayake, Nissanka Yapa Senadhipathi, Kumarasiri Kolambage and Jayantha Perera as accused-respondents.
He states the Director General of the Bribery Commission instituted proceedings in the Colombo Magistrate?s Court and that on the first opportunity available, his Counsel moved Court to raise a preliminary objection on the maintainability of the action wherein it was contended that the complainant had failed to satisfy a mandatory pre-requisite -- a written sanction of the Commission.
The petitioner said the Magistrate on November 17, 2017 overruled the preliminary objections and moved to read the charges and ordered the suspects to record their plea for the charges which were read out in open Court.
Being aggrieved by the said orders of the Magistrate, he filed an application in the Colombo High Court for revisionary jurisdiction.
The High Court Judge in his order on February 2, 2018 refused to issue notice and dismissed the petition.
Being aggrieved with this order he has now filed a revision application in the Court of Appeal seeking to stay the proceedings in the Magistrate?s Court until the final determination of this petition and to revise or set aside the orders of the High Court and allow him to revisit the Magistrate?s Court.

British Council Sri Lanka reveals findings of English Impact Survey
	
Gill Caldicott ? Country Director, British Council Sri Lanka
?
The British Council today announced the findings of its English Impact Survey ? an evaluation of English Language capabilities amongst students in schools across Sri Lanka.
?
At the presentation, invitees were given access to statistics as well as to conclusions drawn from the report which was conducted for the first time, and on a global scale.?
?
An independent research project in collaboration with the Ministry of Education, the British Council evaluated nearly 1,500 students from Grade 11 across a targeted sample of 148 government-funded schools over a period of a year.
?
Students were primarily assessed for their reading, writing, listening and speaking skills, through the administration of the British Council?s APTIS language test ? an internationally employed English proficiency assessment formulated by British Council language testing experts.The Aptis assessment is a computer delivered test (using tabs in this instant), that was used across Sri Lanka for this study.? Aptis is a scalable, flexible and a reliable English assessment tool used worldwide that can be used for a variety of proficiency testing requirements in government, education or corporate? contexts, with results delivered within 48 hrs, said Simon Creasey, Country Exams Manager, British Council.
?
Louise Cowcher ? Director Education, British Council Sri Lanka, Gill Caldicott ? Country Director, British Council Sri Lanka, Maheshi Weerasuriya - Director English, English and Foreign Language Branch, Ministry of Education, Lesley Dick ? ELT Projects Manager, British Council Sri Lanka, K M H Bandara ? Chief Commissioner, Teacher Education, Ministry of Education and Simon Creasey ? Country Examinations Manager
?
Participants were additionally asked to answer a questionnaire -delivered in Sinhalese and Tamil- pertaining to their socio-economic and educational backgrounds as well as their motivations for acquiring a proficiency in the English language
?
Commenting on the results at the launch of the report, Louise Cowcher, Director of Education at the British Council in Sri Lanka, said ?The results of the English Impact Survey is vital; not just in providing us with fresh insight on the quality of English language education in schools, but also with important evidence on the general perception of the language and its importance. This provides us with crucial information that will prove instrumental in driving improvements to the current system of learning English in Sri Lanka.?
?
Key findings highlighted in the 2016/2017 report were:
- Female students outperformed their male counterparts in all assessments. Of the two, female participants were also found to have greater confidence in their ability to learn the language and were also more strongly motivated to learn.
?
- Of the four language skills, listening scored the highest while participants were proven to find reading and speaking the most challenging.
?
Louise Cowcher ? Director Education, British Council Sri Lanka hands over the first copy of the English Impact Survey report to Maheshi Weerasuriya - Director English, English and Foreign Language Branch, Ministry of Education
?
- There is a distinct co-relation between socio-economic status and English language learning motivation. Students from more advantaged backgrounds were found to be greater inclined to study the language than those from less advantaged families.
?
- Young people hold very positive views of the English language, and understand its importance for their personal, social, professional growth.
?
Additionally, the survey is a reflection of the MoE?s commitment to reviewing and enhancing the curricula and learning methods of the English language as part of the education reform process; for a lack of, or poor proficiency in English language skills can negatively affect a young person?s ability to get a job, and on a national scale will greatly hold back economic prosperity when competing for business on a global stage.
?
The British Council is well-established as the primary provider of quality English education and resources in Sri Lanka, and is committed to working with relevant public, private, non-profit, and non-governmental organisations to produce a portfolio of impactful projects such as this English Impact Survey.?

## Title: Croatia send Denmark out of World Cup

Croatia send Denmark out of World Cup
	
It was a full day of penalty-kick drama at the World Cup, with Croatia advancing to the World Cup quarterfinals by outlasting Denmark in a shootout just hours after Russia had done the same to beat Spain in a huge upset. Combined, the two games offered a remarkable number of saves in one-on-one, high-wire confrontations.
The Croatia-Denmark game, in Nizhny Novgorod, started with a stunning outburst, both sides scoring within the first four minutes. But the last 116 or so mostly had defensive play, plus plenty of missed shots.
Denmark went ahead in the very first minute after a huge throw-in by Jonas Knudsen sent the ball into the penalty area, where Croatia was in some disarray. Thomas Delaney got a touch and nudged it to Mathias Jorgensen, who took a shot; it bounced off a couple of Croatian players, including the goalkeeper, and went in.
Croatia?s answer three minutes later was also bizarre. Henrik Dalsgaard of Denmark attempted to clear the ball, but he spanked it right into the head of his teammate Andreas Christensen. It caromed back to the Croatian striker Mario Mandzukic, who accepted the gift and scored from a couple yards out. It was 1-1.
But the furious scoring pace didn?t last, as the game petered out. Both sides, especially Denmark, focused on defense, and any chances that materialized were squandered, sometimes badly. Finally, for the second time on Sunday, a World Cup knockout game went to extra time.
With four minutes left in the added periods, Croatia had a tantalizing opportunity to win it outright. Croatia?s Luka Modric passed from the halfway line to a streaking Ante Rebic. He beat the Denmark goalkeeper, Kasper Schmeichel, and raced toward the goal unimpeded. Jorgensen, the Danish defender rushing in from behind, had little choice but to bring down Rebic, and it was an easy penalty call for the referee.
But Modric?s penalty kick was not strong, and Schmeichel came up with a huge save, holding onto the ball to prevent a rebound.
And so the two teams went on to the second penalty shootout of the day,which turned into a display of solid goalkeeping guesswork. Each side had two of its first four shots blocked, which actually gave Schmeichel three penalty saves, counting his previous one on Modric.
Then came the fifth round of the shootout. Nicolai Jorgensen?s bid to score for Denmark was saved by Croatian keeper Danijel Subasic ? his third save in the shootout. It was up to Schmeichel to yet again come through for Denmark and keep the shootout going. But Ivan Rakitic, the Barcelona star, fired the ball past him, and Croatia was through to the next round.
Croatia must be excited about a matchup with host Russia in the quarterfinal next Saturday. But on the evidence of this game, Russia may be excited about the matchup, too. And in any case, both teams can thank their goalies for stellar work in the shootouts. They kept both Russian and Croatia alive.

Democracy needs a free media - EDITORIAL
	
?
he media are often described as the watchdog of freedom, and many journalists all over the world have lived up to the high moral values and standards the media sets for itself. As is the case with every human endeavour, a few rotten eggs are always found amid the thousands who are ready to die for the lofty principles of their trade. And dying for the principles, if statistics are anything to go by who the journalists are.??
During the period -- 2013 and June 26, 2018 -- statistics published by the International Federation of Journalists (IFJ) show that at least 286 journalists were killed for promoting and defending media freedom. By Thursday morning, that number had jumped to 291 after a gunman stormed the office of the ?Capital Gazette? in the US and killed five more media persons in cold blood.??
In times gone by, rulers of the self-styled protectors of the ?media freedom? ranging from the United States to the UK and France took umbrage against elected rulers from Asia, Africa, China and other countries who they claimed impinged on media freedom.? ?
Today the reverse is taking place. In the US, no lesser person than its President is leading a crusade against the media accusing media personnel of being an enemy of the US people via publication of ?fake news?. President Trump?s soulmate President Durtate of the Philippines has often described opponents in the media in terms which cannot be printed in an editorial column, while President Xi of China or Putin of Russia are not known for their love for media freedom.??
In our own SAARC region during the same 5-year period, over a hundred media persons were assassinated either by state or non-state agents. What is even more sad is, that in India, the largest democracy in the world, a spate of killings of journalists saw 37 journalists losing their lives between 2013 and June 2018 -- killed either by state-friendly assassins or by gangland/militant groups.??
In short, worldwide journalism and media freedom is under threat. Soon the UN may have to consider adding journalists to its list of endangered species. And, ?Fake news? is now the fig leaf with which corrupt political leaders attempt to cover their nakedness.??
Even in Sri Lanka, no lesser person than the present President, who rode into power on the backs of the media, is now seeing Don Quixotic enemies among the media -- those who lampoon him over his gaffes -- as for example his most recent outburst against the provision of Tabs to students. Our President is on record opposing making available tablets to students on the grounds they could be used to download porn! Perhaps he would like to take the country back to the era of the ?Kalu lalla and hunu kura? (slate and chalk) while the world?s children study aerodynamics, a colleague remarked.??
Follow up action against persons responsible for past killings of journalists, attacks on media personnel, arson attacks on media houses and on the state media itself during the term of past regimes have largely been castigated to the dustbins of history, as have some killings of media personnel which occurred during the JVP insurrection of 1989/90.??
While journalists in Colombo are relatively free while our colleagues in the North and their media houses there continue to face numerous threats. Social media too has come under fire from the very regime which came into power on a pledge to media freedom. Not too long ago, a website critical of the President was blocked.??
Claims that the media is the enemy of the people, is wrong in every aspect. The real enmity is between the rich and powerful corrupt political leaders, and the media that expose the illicit, illegal activities and ties of the rich to politically corrupt leaders.? ?

FIFA World Cup 2018: Brazil beat Mexico 2-0 to enter quarters
	
World Cup favourites Brazil have booked their place in the quarter-finals as Neymar scored and assisted in a 2-0 win over Mexico.
The Central Americans started on the front foot, with Hirving Lozano causing endless problems for Filipe Luis and Miranda while Carlos Vela helped to stretch the Brazilian defence.
However, as was the case against Germany, Mexico wasted chance after chance with West Ham striker Javier Hernandez - and his new peroxide-blonde hair - not getting into the box often enough when on the front foot.
The profligacy of Mexico allowed Neymar & Co. to settle in the sweltering heat of Samara, with only Standard Liege keeper Guillermo Ochoa keeping it scoreless at half time.
Ochoa, who has made more saves than any other keeper in Russia so far this summer, was helpless though when, having received the ball from a Neymar backheel, Chelsea?s Willian burst into the box before fizzing the ball back into the path of the world?s most expensive player to tap home.
With Brazil ahead, Mexico made changes, but their problems persisted. As they tired, Tite introduced his own backups, with Liverpool?s Roberto Firmino coming on late.
It took just minutes for the forward to make an impact as, after Neymar had sprung the offside trap of a weary defence, he squared for Firmino to tap home and put the game beyond all doubt.
Neymar will now look to strut his stuff against the winner of Belgium vs Japan, while Mexico head home from a World Cup at this stage for the seventh consecutive tournament. (standard.co.uk)

Gamifying Ahead Through the Enterprise Solutions Landscape
	
Globally, we are witnessing a steady rise in the pace of digital transformation with enterprises leading the charge. Gartner, Inc. projects worldwide IT spending to total $3.7 trillion in 2018 and notes that enterprise software continues to exhibit robust growth, thanks to the rise in the number of businesses actively investing in digital technologies to enhance their products and services. This is great news for markets like Sri Lanka that have identified ICT / BPM as a thrust sector for economic development.
However, enterprise engagements aren?t based on cost arbitrage alone, anymore. On-demand, real-time service delivery is becoming the norm across sectors and millennial consumers are seeking similar experiences in every interaction. As they begin to dominate the workplace and the marketplace, businesses are looking to entice them through gamified engagement efforts.
In the digital realm, the task of shaping these engagement platforms falls on solution developers. They need to comprehend and account for the lifestyle choices of millennial end-users before embarking on any digital transformation project. Often, they tend to draw from their weekend gaming experiences to relate to how and why these Gen Yers do what they do.
A group of 15 young software engineers going by the name Virtusa Game Development Special Interest Group (GDSIG) have been involved in similar endeavorsat Virtusa?s Advanced Technology Center in Colombo since 2006. It was initially envisaged as an informal platform that would allow them to challenge likeminded colleagues in friendly bouts of gaming while exchanging views on the subject.
Ramesh Maddegoda, architect ? Technology at Virtusa was among the small group which founded the Virtusa GDSIG. At that time ?video gaming? was not a popular idea in the Sri Lankan corporate world. So Ramesh and the team had to come up with creative ways to promote the positive aspects of video game development and drive this initiative.
?Our shared passion for gaming brought us together,? says Ramesh. ?In our discussions, we identified that there was an opportunity for Sri Lanka to tap into the game development industry. The soaring revenues generated by the big names in gaming, with some titles grossing as much as Hollywood blockbusters, caught our attention. Armed with basic game development skills, we sought to bring some of this work to Sri Lankan shores,? he reminisces.
The starry-eyed team got their first break in the form of an interactive storybook development project for a global education solutions provider. And they haven?t looked back since then. Today, the unit includes Virtusans from different functions, practices and even geographies. They work closely with teams from around Virtusa on a diverse set of enterprise engagements wherein clients are looking to create game like interactive experiences.
?We are currently exploring the potential of using augmented reality tags to provide information on off-the-shelf medication for pharmacists and patients,? says Ramindu Deshapriya, senior consultant ? Technology.
Elaborating on this project for a Fortune 500 healthcare services company, Ramindu said, "Augmented reality overlay on a mobile app would provide a way for users to view the details regarding a particular medicine right at the drug store.?
Chipping in about their work in promoting medication adherence, Thuan Preena, engineer ? Technology at Virtusa says, ?Aging populations bring with them the challenges associated with caring for the elderly, especially those with medical conditions that require them to take medications regularly.?
?We developed an IoT based solution that rewards users with points when they take their medicines on time and allowed them to use these points to contribute to a charity of their choice. And we were delighted to see a marked improvement in medication adherence,? Thuan added.?
?While these might seem like the obvious routes anyone should and would take in hindsight, we wouldn?t have been able to come up with such ideas had we adopted a traditional approach to solution development,? underscores Kavinda Karunanayake, senior consultant ? Technology at Virtusa.?
He added, ?We had the opportunity to experience the power of gamified work environments first hand thanks to V+, our proprietary internal social business platform that helps drive collaboration and engagement amongst Virtusans. Our interactions with and through V+ guided us to take the gamification path. We also had the privilege of being mentored by members of our leadership team who continue to inspire us.?
Scaling greater heights with their gamified approach to enterprise solution development, Virtusa?s Game Development Special Interest Group presents a strong business case for reimagining our digital worlds through gamification. While they continue to contribute to business projects, it is not all work and no play for the GDSIG.
As avid gamers they have been organizing the Virtusa LAN Challenge, a gaming contest for their fellow Virtusans, since 2010. It started off as a low key internal team building initiative and has now grown into a mainstay event in Virtusa?s calendar with teams from several leading local universities taking part in this year?s tournament. The GDSIG team works together with the company?s technology leadership and members of the Virtusa Campus Reach Initiative on this annual event.
They also seek to instill their passion for gaming and game development in the next generation of IT professionals. Partnering with the Virtusa Campus Reach Initiative, team members can often be found delivering tech talks at universities around the island where they share insights on game development, opportunities available and more.

Growth mindset and how to unfix your mind: ?Teacher can be immortal,?  - Prof. Kirthi Premadasa
	
?
Student enjoying the education is the key
	?
	What is important is ?tenacity? and the ability to take challenges
?
A reputed Sri Lankan born mathematician and scientist Prof. Kirthi Premadasa is currently in the country as a United States Fulbright Specialist promoting ?Growth Mindset?, a novel concept and approach to education. Professor Premadasa a Professor of Mathematics at University of Wisconsin-Platteville, was the recipient of the University of Wisconsin System?s Regents Teaching Excellence Award this year, . This prestigious award, ?Outstanding UW System Teacher?, was the highest?
teaching recognition in the system that recognizes two faculty members selected from over 3000 faculty members of all 27 universities of the University of Wisconsin System. He has an impressive number of peer-reviewed publications and presentations in Mathematics and College Education and he obtained his PhD from Purdue University USA. A student of Ananda College Colombo, Prof. Premadasa has over 24 years of teaching experience both in the University of Wisconsin System and at the University of Colombo.?
Prof. Premadasa who is to conduct a lecture and workshop on the topic ?Optimizing your potential through a growth mindset? shared some important points that would be great help to parents, students and those responsible for handling education in the country. Excerpts;?
?
?Q? How do you explain the concept of ?Growth Mindset??
Let me explain with an example. I studied at Ananda College Colombo and I was not good at arts and it was only once that my drawing was taken to the front of the class. Then I always thought that I was bad at drawing and I hid myself from that. Whenever there was a challenge and somebody asked me to draw something I hid from that.?
But recently my young daughter asked me to draw a duck for her and initially I thought I cannot draw but I did not want to tell this to? her. I slowly looked at the YouTube and drew a duck and the child was happy.
This experience led me to think about the growth mindset because I know about it. I realised that my mindset was fixed. I thought I am bad at arts so I was avoiding any situation where I had to do that. I was scared that I would come out as an idiot. Now that my daughter wanted me to draw and I had to do it.? Next time my daughter came and asked me to draw a dolphin. I did it better because I was careful about my mistakes in drawing. More mistakes I make my brain will create more connections and more electricity. So I followed the concept of? ?Growth Mindset? to learn a new area. I learnt drawing and I enjoyed doing it. This could be applied to any subject.?
?
?Q??What are the important areas in learning through Growth Mindset?
Student enjoying the education is the key. But there are well documented research strategies as to how to make somebody a self regulated learner.?
Self regulated learning is that we are regulating our learning. How do you create a person like that. This is a problem our Sri Lankan parents are having. How do you make your child enjoy learning.?
Following growth mindset will take the pressure away from our parents and children. There are three important things to know if you want to study the growth mindset. The target, the goal and set back. Once you know them there will be an overall mind change.??
Almost every school in the United States follows this and there are Growth Mindset programmes.??
?
?Q??Do you think this can be introduced to Sri Lanka?
Why not. This can be easily introduced to the Sri Lankan school system as well. But you cannot just limit it to schools. It should be to whole parents, teachers, pupils and society. Everybody must embrace this idea or concept. Then only you will achieve the holistic idea of the growth mindset.
?
?Q??Instead of taking part in a rat-race this is a concept where you become more humble yourself for learning.
You are right. You are humbling yourself to free yourself. Once you are free from all these bondages, you will enjoy your learning much more.? I still have certain amount of fear with regard to my drawing but I know that my drawing has improved.?
?
With regard to mathematics even at this point when someone gives me a math to solve I might get stuck if I started thinking that I have a PhD and I should somehow do it. But once I give up this pressure away, I will get better ideas and even realise that the problem is not at all difficult.?
By following this method it will take pressure out of the minds of our parents and children. The most important thing in the growth mindset is you must know what it is.?
?
?Q??When did you start learning about this?
It was about five years ago. Prof. Carol S. Dweck was the one who started doing research on this. I learnt about it because I teach Math education. I am always looking for the best education methods and best ways of teaching to my students. I won an award for my teaching and to win that kind of an award I must always be current and follow latest pedagogies, the best way to teach my students. I was always exploring this. And I got a grant to read this book on ?Growth mindset? with my colleagues and we discussed it elaborately. Then there was another book on Mathematical Mindsets: Unleashing Students? Potential through Creative Math, Inspiring Messages and Innovative Teaching by Jo Boaler. That also I did another session.?
?
This can be easily introduced to the Sri Lankan school system as well
	?
	This can be applied to growth mindset. You have to put it into work

?Q??As a teacher why do you think teaching with these novel methods is important?
In the United States when we are teaching we want our students to be always better. Because we feel that we can change their lives and when we do that you know what happens. Everybody dies and I will die. I talk like a big guy today but someday in twenty to thirty years I will be lying in a bed and I would not even know the difference between even one and two. When somebody says what is one plus two I would as ?what?. I would probably have dementia. But if I change my students, they will learn and they will be talking and they will be performing well. So teaching is a unique profession and a teacher is a person who can reach immortality. Teacher can be immortal because when the teacher is dying, the students are living. So I always think in this manner and this is my philosophy. I want to change my students? lives by actually getting them to learn. I want them to discover their best. This is a good thing for our teachers as well. I know that Sri Lanka also has some teachers like that. But unfortunately our education system caters for exams. I constantly try to improve my teaching so that my students will constantly be better and better learners. By that way I know that I have not spent my life in vain.? Most good teachers in the US are like this. They want their students be enlightened learners. Not just study for an exam.??
?
"I can try introducing this to Sri Lanka and I think it can be done. This is a system where your whole way of thinking is changed. Now if this is done by the Education Ministry you have to invest on this"
?
?Q??Passing Mathematics specially at the GCE Ordinary Level? is a massive hurdle for students in Sri Lanka. The Ordinary level mathematics paper decides the entire life. As a mathematician how do you describe this situation?
Growth mindset can be applied to mathematics as well. Maths is a subject that everybody can do. You just have to work hard. There is no alternative for working hard. When I was at Ananda College, in one exam I got 27 out of 100 for my mathematics paper. Teacher called my mother (who was also a teacher) to the school and the my class teacher was my mother?s student. My teacher made a big fuss about my marks. But I later found a maths teacher who changed my life and then I started getting ?A?s and a first class in mathematics and I went on to earn? a PhD in mathematics. But students must not think that this will come easily. The fact that you don?t get mathematics easily does not mean that you are not good at mathematics.?
This can be applied to growth mindset. You have to put into work. That is the advice I am giving to young people. All the mathematics that you do at the Ordinary Level can be mastered. You don?t have to have a superior brain. Some of? them might have to work a little bit more. So go for the effort and there is no short cut to hard work. Through hard work you can achieve.?
Anyway I don?t want to question on this system because I am also someone who went through this system and entered university. I cannot say this not important. There are many who went to the university through this hard system and now doing well. While you are getting the grades it is important about the process of learning as well. That is doing what you like to do. Let your brain to embrace mistakes. And learn through the mistakes. Get out of the target of becoming a genius. Albert Einstein had to work very hard. He once said if you think your mistakes are big, mine are bigger.?
Even if you take religion and religious leaders they worked very hard. If you take the Buddha he worked very hard. What I want to tell the ordinary level students is to think about trying and trying. More than the grades in the exam ,try to take a new challenge.
?
?Q??What is the response of the world to ?Growth mindset??
As a matter of fact Stanford University and certain universities in the US are changing their admission. Now at the Stanford University, eight percent are apparently reserved not for grades but for the ability to take challenges. Now studies have found that when a child is between one year to five years the phrase that ?you are intelligent and smart and clever and brainy?? will affect him or her whether that person is ready to take a challenge or not. From the small age if you allow the child to take up the challenge it would be good. The Miscrosoft CEO has constructed that,? more than the grades what is important is ?tenacity? and the ability to take challenges. What is more important is tenacity. This is very hot now. Australia, the Britain and the US where it started at the Stanford it is popular.?
?
?Q??if you are invited to introduce Growth Mindset to our educators and the education system are you ready to help?
This time I came here as a Fulbright scholar and then I was invited to share with whatever I could with Sri Lanka and organised some sessions. But if I am doing it comprehensively I will have to study what is happening in India and other Asian countries, and the best way to develop it. But to be honest I have only studied the researches done in the US and I know some researches done in Australia and then I did some research in England. It is happening all over the world.?
I can try introducing this to Sri Lanka and I think it can be done. This is a system where your whole way of thinking is changed. Now if this is done by the Education Ministry you have to invest on this. This does not limit to just giving a lecture to teachers. That should be given to every strata of the society, that is The teachers, parents, professionals and students. It should be over all. Even in the job opportunities this has to be there because the child who learnsww with growth mindset will go to a job one day. You cant introduce part by part. Even the Fulbright Commission told me that it is a need. Had I know this is a need I would have come for this. I would have easily done some workshops.?

			Prof. Premadasa, an outstanding educator
			?
			Selecting Prof. Premadasa as one of the recipients of the award, Regent Janice Mueller, chair of the selection committee has stated ?These outstanding educators inspire students and fellow teachers alike with their innovative approaches to teaching and learning?. ?We are pleased to recognize their dedication to student success, demonstrating how learning can change lives,? he added.
			Prof. Premadasa was selected for his strong commitment to teaching and learning; use of effective teaching strategies to enhance student learning; and significant impact on students? intellectual development.
			In selecting Prof. Premadasa, Associate Professor, Mathematics Department, UW-Baraboo/Sauk County, UW Colleges, as a recipient of this year?s award it was stated , ?as a mathematician and scientist, he implements his teaching philosophy in class through a wide range of research-guided interventions. For example, to address student difficulty understanding integration applications, his review of existing research revealed the underlying cause to be students? inability to visualize an integral as an accumulation. He and his colleagues developed a special lesson to help students, which Premadasa published in a peer-reviewed international journal. He engages students with deep learning and robust peer discussion; creates relevance with realistic word problems; organizes effective professional development for teachers; and facilitates optimal curricular change. He worked with the department chair to design a new pathway for students taking developmental mathematics to increase the odds they would go on to pass college algebra. The program is now in its third year with positive results. Premadasa also designed and taught a projectbased business algebra course using UW-Extension?s competency-based model. He has mentored four undergraduate research projects, two of which have gone on to be published. In last December, he was named a U.S. Fulbright Specialist in Mathematics Education for a three-year term.

			Growth Mindset- Research every teacher should know
			?
			There is a wealth of psychology research that can help teachers to improve how they work with students, but academic studies of this kind aren?t always easy to access or translate into the realities of classroom practice. This series seeks to redress that by taking a selection of studies and making sense of the important information for teachers, as we all seek to answer the question: how can we help our students do better at school? This time, we consider growth mindset.
			Growth mindset ? the idea that intelligence can be developed rather than it being set in stone ? is arguably the most popular psychological theory in education at the moment. It was launched into mainstream consciousness after a seminal growth mindset study almost 20 years ago and has since spawned many assemblies and form tutor-time activities.

Mexicans vote for a new president on Sunday in an election tipped to hand power to an anti-establishment outsider who would inject a new dose of nationalism into government and could sharpen divisions with Donald Trump?s United States.?

?Former Mexico City mayor Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has led opinion polls throughout the campaign and would be the first leftist to take the presidency in decades in Mexico if he ousts the ruling centrist Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI).? ?
?Runner-up in the 2012 and 2006 elections, Lopez Obrador pitches himself as the only man capable of cleaning up a political class whose credibility has been ground down by persistent graft, soaring crime levels and years of sub-par economic growth.? ?
??The new president of Mexico will have moral and political authority to demand everyone behaves with integrity and make honesty a priority as a way of life,? Lopez Obrador said in his campaign finale in a soccer stadium in the capital on Wednesday.? ?

## Title: Northern Fishermen Respond to Demand for Unconditional Release of TN Vessels

Northern Fishermen Respond to Demand for Unconditional Release of TN Vessels
	
?Fishery community leaders at discussion. From left to right K. Rajachandran (Karainagar, Jaffna) , J. Francis (Pooneryn, Kilinochchi), M. Alam (Palamunai, Mannar), N. V. Subramaniam (Manipay, Jaffna) and A. Annarasa (Thambattai, Jaffna)??
?
Small scale fishery community leaders from Jaffna, Kilinochchi and Mannar held a press conference in Jaffna last week (Wednesday) in response to news that the government is preparing to give into demands from New Delhi, and release hundreds of Tamil Nadu trawlers arrested for illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing in Sri Lankan waters. Sri Lanka?s former Minister of Foreign Affairs Mangala Samaraweera agreed to the release of 42 Tamil Nadu trawlers as (yet another) ?gesture of goodwill? during the last round of bilateral talks between Sri Lankan and Indian ministers held in New Delhi in November 2017. But according to fishermen in Jaffna his decision was reached only this week after consulting and getting concurrence from fishery community leaders in the north. In return for the 42 fishing craft, the Government of India undertook to introduce meaningful measures to finally bring an end to IUU fishing by Tamil Nadu trawlers in Sri Lankan waters, the fishermen said.? ?
Fishery community leaders expressed their frustration that neither the Government of India nor the State Government of Tamil Nadu have taken any meaningful measures to stop the unrelenting violation of Sri Lankan sovereignty by thousands of Tamil Nadu trawlers every week. On what basis they asked was the government considering the unconditional release of hundreds of Tamil Nadu vessels? What guarantees could the Sri Lankan government give fishermen that these vessels once released would not return the next day and poach in Sri Lankan waters???
?
"According to reports 10.96 kg of ?trash fish? was discarded for every kg of prawns landed; a discard ratio of 91.6%!"
?
Arrested Tamil Nadu Trawl in Kayts
National and international researchers have estimated that IUU fishing by Tamil Nadu trawlers in Sri Lankan waters causes an annual loss of Rs.6 billion to the Sri Lanka?s fishery sector. Seafood industry sources suggest that the same amount again -- equivalent to US$ 42 million -- is being lost by the Sri Lankan seafood export industry every year. The country?s rich marine resources are being harvested illegally by Tamil Nadu trawlers and sold to seafood processing factories there.?
The threat posed by IUU fishing and seafood fraud to the sustainability of global seafood stocks is explained in the US Presidential Initiative on Combating IUU Fishing and Seafood Fraud (2015). The Initiative states that IUU fishing and fraudulent seafood products distort legal markets and unfairly compete with the products of law-abiding fishers and seafood industries globally. The fisheries sector, seafood industry and government are well aware that the European Commission(EC) has its own regulation to prevent, deter and eliminate IUU fishing (2010). In October 2014 the EC banned the export of Sri Lankan seafood products to European countries, costing Sri Lanka millions of dollars in lost export revenue. The ban was enacted in April 2015 due to alleged IUU fishing by a handful of Sri Lankan vessels in British-Indian Ocean Territories, following a complaint to the EC by the British government. The EC?s regulation reiterates that IUU fishing depletes fish stocks, destroys marine habitats, distorts competition, puts honest fishers at an unfair disadvantage, and weakens coastal communities, particularly in developing countries.??
No one -- not even Tamil Nadu trawler owners -- disputes the fact that mechanized bottom trawling in shallow, coastal waters depletes fish stocks and destroys critical marine habitats. According to a report published by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations in 1994, the top five most wasteful global fisheries were all mechanized prawn trawl fisheries[1]. Sri Lanka?s prawn trawl fishery was rated the fourth most wasteful fishery in the world in 1994. According to the report 10.96 kg of ?trash fish? was discarded for every kg of prawns landed; a discard ratio of 91.6%! In July last year, the government finally banned mechanized trawling in Sri Lankan waters in response to the demands from small scale fishermen and concerns from environmentalists about the wanton destruction of marine resources. Sri Lanka became the fourth country after Hong Kong, Palau and Indonesia to demonstrate its commitment to the sustainable fisheries by banning mechanized bottom trawling in its waters. In December last year, the government amended the Fisheries (Regulation of Foreign Fishing Boats) Act. Once again in response to protests and demands by small scale fishermen (and their lawyers). The amendment increased the penalties for foreign fishing boats arrested for illegal fishing and revised the jurisdiction of the Act from the High to the Magistrate?s Court.? ?
?
"Fishery community leaders argue that cordial relations with India cannot be achieved by abandoning Sri Lanka?s sovereignty"
?
In Jaffna last week, fishery community leaders acknowledged the government?s desire to maintain ?cordial relations? with its much larger neighbour. But they argued, this cannot be achieved by abandoning Sri Lanka?s sovereignty; by ignoring international regulations, initiatives or national laws; by accepting multi-million dollar losses to Sri Lanka?s export and fisheries sectors or forsaking Sri Lanka?s commitment to sustainable management of marine resources. The leaders said they were ready and willing to support the government in negotiations with India on the release of vessels, but not without conditions. Sri Lankan fishermen called upon the government to use the Fisheries (Regulation of Foreign Fishing Boats) Act to finally end IUU fishing by Tamil Nadu trawlers in?
Sri Lankan waters.??

## Title: Old age is the Verdict of Life - Out of the Blue; Bumped into ?Deadline-75?
## Section: News Features

Old age is the Verdict of Life - Out of the Blue; Bumped into ?Deadline-75?
	
?
?The moral test of a State is how it treats the elderly; those who are in the dimness of life; the sick, the deprived and the handicapped.?
- Hubert H. Humphrey?
?
I have seen quite a few of my classmates, friends and relatives depart this world before they reached 75 without being fortunate to experience the great independence and freewill that comes with aging. I remember many important things of past in school and early carrier but not what happened in the morning, a day before; worse why I chose to walk up to a place within the house, the purpose, gone blank in a couple of minutes. Yet nothing lost, it is a matter of making a few futile attempts to remember which never helped. Nothing lost; just return to the original place you will recollect why; but names of persons quite familiar with and committed to memory often goes empty too.? ?
?
Image of the Noble Profession?
Some medical specialists are in the habit of ridiculing the elderly who look for their advice, saying, ?it is a case of old age, natural phenomenon and no cure?; the patient must tell them to treat you instead of such wicked discourtesy. A leading Ophthalmologist, it was reported, had mocked and ridiculed an Octogenarian -- the patient, a former Civil Servant on the basis of his age. He even quoted a verse from the ?Guttila Kavya?, a 15th century satire to support his contempt. He had no admiration for the ?touching life of an elderly. The victim a senior public servant wrote,??
?
"I remember many important things of past in school and early carrier but not what happened in the morning, a day before; worse why I chose to walk up to a place within the house, the purpose, gone blank in a couple of minutes. Yet nothing lost, it is a matter of making a few futile attempts to remember which never helped"
?Recently I saw a leading Ophthalmologist to seek a cure for my dwindling eyesight. The Specialist examined my eyes and declared, ?mata mahalu wayase beriya veena gaayanaa perase? and his assistants giggled in response. Despite my discomfiture about that reaction, I explained that I was spending about four or five hours at the computer every day and the Specialist replied that the state of my optical nerves showed that such performance was unbelievable. No remedy was recommended and to my request for enhancing my reading vision, I was asked to see an optician. As I left, the Specialist was repeating the Guttila lines, creating another ripple of chuckles, much to my embarrassment. The question, ?If so, of what use is your medicine?? was uppermost in my mind but I did not give expression to it out of courtesy.? The Ophthalmologist is certainly not learned in manners. He has stained the image of the noble profession.?? ?
The authorities say, the latest life expectancy index for men in Sri Lanka stands at 75 years. The other day when I became lazy to dig through archives, while searching for historical facts and related information for an article, I felt it too.??
Ignatz Nascher is called the father of geriatrics, a medical specialty invented by him 100 years ago and the author of ?Geriatrics: The Diseases of Old Age and their Treatment?-1914. Nascher was a medical student and part of a team doing rounds in an American hospital when he came to a septuagenarian woman who was seriously ill. The lecturer avoided wasting time on her ?diognising? the case as ?old age? and nothing can be done. Inventing the term ?geriatrics?, Nasher wrote his book several years later. A fitting response to our medical specialists who are pessimistic over treating the ?old?. Geriatrics is defined as, ?a branch of medicine dealing with the diseases, debilities and care of the aged persons?.??
?
Demographic Transition?
In the developed world aging is considered to be a problem; Japan, China, Russia, Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and Thailand are already in the group. Japan leads the oldest population, while China?s one-child per family has tilted the age demography. India, with its youthful population is becoming a gigantic global economic player.? ?
They say, Sri Lanka is one of the fastest-aging countries in the world, with a significant proportion of the population aged 60 years or older projected to jump from 12.5% to 16.7% in 2021. Even though such demographic transition affects many countries, the speed of change is particularly dramatic for Sri Lanka. Many developing countries are listed as aging. Aging will create severe economic problems, according to economists. It will cause a slowdown in the growth of working populations compared to the past 10 years, causing problems with supply of labour.? ?
Sri Lanka is steadily increasing in the proportion of the aged and is likely to double by 2030.??
?Welfare measures linked to healthcare are among the things that contributed to this increase.? ?
?Health service is the most significant service required in the case of the elders. In Sri Lanka the elderly are treated by the same group of medical personnel, satisfactorily competent to care for the general population. It could be stated that Geriatrics is a fairly unavailable section of medicine. The number of available Geriatricians in Sri Lanka is insignificant. We do not attempt to probe into why they do not branch out into numerous disciplines in the treatment of elders which is beyond the scope of this article.? ?
Free healthcare has facilitated their prolonged existence. The most significant problems faced by the old-aged who depend on the state health service are as follows -- protracted waiting times for medicine, consultations and other services; unavailability of drugs, medicine and laboratory facilities; restricted access to specialized treatment; unavailability of appointment system.??
As a habit, we consider sickness of the aged as something to be expected and need no special care. What cannot be cured has to be endured appears to influence their view when examining an elderly patient. No insult is intended but it is only an observation of what is seen around. Healthcare for the very old, who are virtually helpless or bed-ridden should be made available at their homes. We have a lot of old people because good doctors keep them alive.? ?
?
Responsibility of State
Teaching of younger people on needs of the old, tolerance and understanding in a developing country like Sri Lanka is vital. However, one cannot blame the children, they have to focus on their immediate family and their own career. Quite apart from meeting essential healthcare needs, sufficient care for elders to stay at home, sheltered care, residential places, nursing homes and hospices with elderly accustomed care are a must.??
The state must look into the financial scarcity of old age, there are those without a fixed monthly income like pension, interest on deposits and dividends from shares. Government must do a proper survey of such cases and pay a living pension. A welfare state concept is the most suitable in the above context. A sense of lethargy and alienation is generally associated with old age. Loss of loved ones and friends of the same age; loss of status and of a role adversely affect the elderly. Admit the reality; we will have a big elderly population with equally high costs of care. Do everything achievable to maintain their physical condition with sound precautionary policies. Make them as productive as likely to be by finding positions for them in society which are commonly helpful.? ?
?
Cheerful and Undefeated
I do not feel desolate over my body, the grey and falling hair, the sagging butt, wrinkles, the shapeless eyes. I keep the heart unwrinkled, to be hopeful, cheerful, reverent that is to conquest over old age. Old age is a pleasant thing?it comes on swiftly, and not slowly as is thought.Though you are smoothly shouldered off the stage, but then you are given such a relaxed, calm front stall as an observer. For the first time in my life I am now, the man I have always wanted to be.

PC elections should be held immediately under new or old systems: TNA
	
The Tamil National Alliance (TNA) asserted yesterday that the government should enact new electoral reforms within the next two months to conduct the elections to the three provincial councils which are already overdue, or else revert to the old system to do so without any further delay.
The terms of the Eastern, North-central and Sabaragamuwa Provincial Councils ended in October last year. However, the government enacted a new piece of legislation in the form of an amendment to the Provincial Councils Elections (Amendment) Act to introduce a new electoral system. The elections to these councils are withheld since then, pending the incorporation of these electoral reforms. The TNA is also a political entity that supported this exercise in Parliament at that time.
TNA MP for the Jaffna District M.A. Sumanthiran told Daily Mirror though the elections should be conducted, the laws were not in place for the purpose at the moment.
?The only way to hold elections is to resolve that issue immediately. It must be done within the next one or two months. If it cannot be done in two months, the government must repeal the amendment that caused this problem and hold the elections under the old system. Then, we can discuss the reforms leisurely. We are for reforms. But, they should not be used to delay elections,? he said.
Asked about elections in the North, he said the council was yet to be dissolved. Asked whether the TNA would nominate current Chief Minister C.V. Wigneswaran as the would be candidate, he said it was a failed project done last time. (Kelum Bandara)

## Title: Predicament of the Legal Profession
## Section: Opinion

Predicament of the Legal Profession
	
?
"We live at a time when core values of the profession are being threatened. As a result the whole climate of opinion has become hostile to the legal profession"
	?
	"They resort to what is known as police touting for their survival. They have a secret arrangement with the police whereby the police direct the litigants to their favourite lawyers and thereafter they split the fees"
?
There has been a growing concern about the deterioration of the professional standards of the legal community in many countries. This trend is particularly seen in many Third World countries including Sri Lanka. The deterioration in professional standards is often reflected in the quality of legal output and the professional services rendered by the legal community. Decline in competency, efficiency and the standards of the legal profession are bound to bring about corresponding decline in the standards on the Bench, because it is the Bar, which nurtures and fosters those who aspire to a career in the judiciary.? ?
?We live at a time when core values of the profession are being threatened. As a result the whole climate of opinion has become hostile to the legal profession. According to the latest survey conducted by the American Pew Research Centre public esteem for the legal profession has declined sharply over the last few years. The legal profession has been ranked the lowest among the professions, ?For the Americans the legal profession is one the most despised and hated professions. It commands little respect in their estimation?.? ?
Although much has been spoken and written on the deteriorating standards, nothing substantial seems to have been done to arrest this trend by the authorities charged with the responsibility of regulating the profession in this country. There have been no genuine efforts to address the problems affecting litigants in many ways by the professional misconduct and malpractices indulged in by the few individuals in the profession.? ?
?There are a multitude of questions connected with the legal profession. One thing is manifestly clear; unless and until serious problems confronting the profession are addressed in a realistic manner we must expect further deterioration of the professional standards and the eventual collapse of law and order in the county. One can see an attitude of complacency and resignation in the face of this declining trend. It is regrettable that there is a surprising and disturbing sense of apathy and inertia on the part of the part of the authorities.? ?
If you walk into some of the courts in the island particularly the Magistrate?s Court you can see for yourself how touts and other intermediaries hang around the environs of Courts to persuade prospective litigants to retain particular Attorneys-at-Law regardless of their abilities and capabilities. In some courts Attorneys-at-Law themselves stand outside the court houses with business cards in hand, offering their services to litigants; a disgusting practice which degrades the whole profession. They lack boundaries when stooping to such low conduct. People are appalled by the shame and disgrace some lawyers bring to the profession and the legal profession has suffered tremendous damage to its image by the conduct of a few unscrupulous lawyers.? ?
Then, there are some lawyers who depend entirely on the police for their practice. They resort to what is known as police touting for their survival. They have a secret arrangement with the police whereby the police direct the litigants to their favourite lawyers and thereafter they split the fees. For each case the police officer gets his share of the fees. There are also instances where defence lawyers have made attempts to win over the witnesses with the cooperation of prosecuting officers with the intention of securing acquittals in cases. Touting has long been an offence under the Intermeddlers with Suitors Act of 1894. But prosecutions under this act have been few and far between. Therefore, it is time that all forms of touting and soliciting are eradicated from the legal practice. It is also the responsibility of the police department and the police commission to take necessary remedial measures in regard to misconduct and malpractices resorted to by the police in the course of the administration of justice.? ?
It is essential that lawyers should be dignified in their speech. Some lawyers address police officers as ?Machan? and the police officers in turn address the lawyers by their first names. Some lady lawyers too address police officers by their first nameswhile the police officers too address them by their first names. People are profoundly concerned with this lack of civility and professionalism demonstrated by the lawyers and other agents involved in the administration of the justice system.? ?
Members of the legal profession occupy a position of privilege because of the high nature of its calling. Not only in Srilanka but all over the world there is a high proportion of heads of State, ministers and high officials drawn from the ranks of the legal profession. For centuries lawyers have stood at the centre of society. There were eminent and patriotic lawyers in the past who fought valiantly for the independence of this country. The Legal profession has a rich and glorious past and members of the legal fraternity can justifiably be proud of its past.? ?
?The legal career has been a hallmark of prestige. For centuries, the practice of the law has been considered a profession. The word profession suggests a certain stature and prestige. The legal profession claims to be an honourable and noble profession. But it should be remembered that the honour and nobility come to a profession by the conduct and the behaviour of its members.There have been instances when the bar enmasse refused to appear for certain litigants; a practice repugnant to the ethical principles of the profession. But it should be remembered that professional ethics demand that a lawyer who practises his profession is duty bound to appear for any litigant who seeks his services regardless of the nature of the case or any opinion, which the lawyer might have formed as to the character, reputation, cause, conduct of that person. In some instances lawyers confine their practice to a particular field of law and the lawyers who are engaged in notarial work invariably delegate their notarial tasks to clerks, secretaries and other lay persons. Such delegations would be proper as long as the lawyer maintains direct relationship with his clients and supervises the delegated work and takes complete responsibility for the work done. But there have been instances where lawyers have notarized deeds and other conveyancing documents drafted by their clerks and signed in the absence of the attorney in contravention of the Notary?s Ordinance. It is illegal for a notary to notarize any previously signed conveyancing documents, and in these cases the attorney attesting the conveyancing documents had never been present to testify to the identification of parties. This is a practice in conflict with the most fundamental requirements of the office of lawyer doing notarial work. A client visits a lawyer who is engaged in notarial work, when there is an issue that needs addressing in the hope that the lawyer would attend to his needs with fidelity. But his failure to perform his duties as a notary would result not only in immense damage to those directly affected by the impugned document but also undermine the integrity of the notary. Therefore, it is the duty of every lawyer who acts as a notary to discharge his functions faithfully to the satisfaction of his client.? ?
Although defalcation and embezzlement of money by lawyers acting in a fiduciary capacity is not a frequent phenomenon we cannot say it is rare. Because there have been instances in which some lawyers were embroiled in financial scandals and other fraudulent transactions. Public look to the profession to keep its house in order. When a lawyer defalcates funds belonging to clients the whole profession is blackened in the public eye.? ?
Generally every learned profession demands proper decent attire. Therefore, it is imperative for legal practitioners to dress appropriately in a manner that enhances respect for the legal profession and dignity of the court. It should be realised that the image of an attorney matters a lot and they should not look sloppy in appearance as a sloppy appearance would be likely to affect the perception of the litigants. What the lawyers wear in courts can have major impact on the perception of litigants and the members of the public. A bad dress will make a bad impression on the clients and the people. There have been instances when courts have come down hard on Attorneys who have failed to dress appropriately.It is true that merits of an argument in a case and a good knowledge of the law are crucial to wining a case but the value of the image of an Attorney should not be underestimated.? ?
The bar must maintain the highest standards of integrity, as an honourable bar is a strong support to an honourable bench. Uprightness and integrity is something every client expects from every legal practitioner. Even the conduct unrelated to one?s practice which may be demonstrably attributed to lack of integrity tends to lower the esteem in which the whole profession is held.? ?
Over the past few decades, members admitted to the legal profession have increased by leaps and bounds. Along with that increase the profession has become highly competitive and commercialised. ?In an era of intense competition and commercialization legal practitioners in their race for survival will tend to place the monetary aspect of the profession higher than the core values and aspirations of the profession. It would be of paramount importance to all of us who are interested in the profession to work determinedly keep aloft the high ideals for which the profession has stood for centuries. We must resolutely conduct ourselves to measure up to the standards set and maintained by our predecessors. May the glorious past serve as an example for the members of the profession to tread the correct path. May the members have the wisdom and strength to do so.

Protest over drinking water shortage turns violent in Iran
	
?
DPA, 01st JULY, 2018- A protest against water shortages in south-western Iran turned violent as the police intervened and clashed with demonstrators, according to Iranian media reports on Sunday.
Areas of Khuzestan province have been without water for days in temperatures above 45 degrees Celsius, sparking protests in the port city of Khorramshahr.
Cell phone videos showed police officers using tear gas against demonstrators late Saturday. Some participants were also shouting anti-government slogans, according to social media posts.
Iranian news agencies reported that protesters had caused damage to buildings and set small fires. Iranian Interior Minister Abdolreza Rahmani Fazli said the government had no problem with people holding protests but that police had to take action if they ?get out of hand.?
He said police had fired their weapons as they tried to disperse the crowd and that one person had been injured.
The problem with the water supply arose because of burst pipe that will be repaired in the next few days, the provincial governor said, according to the ISNA news agency.
?We apologize ... we are going to fix the problem and solve this legitimate concern of the citizens,? Gholamreza Shariati said.
Economic protests have multiplied recently in Iran amid rising prices and the plummeting value of the rial currency. Thousands took part in a mass rally in Tehran?s Grand Bazaar last week.

Sri Lanka improves ranking on JLL?s Global Transparency Index
	
Global real estate consultancy Jones Lang La Salle (JLL) launched the 10th edition ofthe Global Real Estate Transparency Index this month. Sri Lanka ranked 66 out of 100economies this year, improving from its 2016 debut ranking of 69. With peers Myanmar improving by 22 places to rank at 73, and Vietnam ranking at 61 in 2018, Sri Lanka must focus on maintaining its upward momentum in an increasingly competitive market for real estate growth.
JLL?s Global Real Estate Transparency Index meets a strong demand for accessible, in-depth analysis into the domestic property markets of 100 countries and 158 cities around the world. The index quantifies transparency based on 139 variables relating to the transaction process, regulatory and legal frameworks, corporate governance, performance measurement and data availability with higher real estate transparency being associated with stronger investor and corporate real estate activity. In 2016 it included Sri Lanka in its ranking for the first time, creating a sustained dialogue on the varied challenges faced by local and international investors while engaging in real-estate transactions in the country.
The new report concurs with industry experts on the need for implementing a number of measures to maintain Sri Lanka?s momentum towards greater transparency in the real-estate market. With Asia leading the charge in block chain and property technology, Sri Lanka has an immense opportunity to leverage disruptive technology in order to implement public access to digital land registry services, digital survey protocols and to liberate planning approvals for public scrutiny. Moreover, there is a strong push for the Government of Sri Lanka to ratify the Foreign Mortgage Law, consider reforms to laws preventing foreigners owning land in Sri Lanka and introduce incentives for buying real such as residency visas.
?Public Private Partnerships are tremendous engines for increased transparency,? noted JLL Sri Lanka Managing Director Steven Mayes. Mr Mayes references projects such as the USD 40 billion Western Region Mega polis Plan, the Colombo Port City and a number of other development projects to be financed via a PPP model. He added, ?As the market moves towards consolidated maturity, following a post conflict boom, measures that will enhance clarity and encourage investment include tax breaks and legislation to permit REITs to flourish and designated special economic zones that allow foreign companies the clarity to structure an orderly entry into Sri Lanka.?
JLL?s new report finds that the influx of related-service professionals in Colombo to facilitate large real estate transactions has led to the shortage of commercial office space in the city, with occupancy rates exceeding 95%. The business class, 4-star hotel sector in Colombo is also witnessing a strong demand while certain established 5 star brands languish some way behind. The report also offers a comprehensive overview of the influence of macroeconomic factors affecting the market, including the implementation of the government?s Vision 2025 agenda, spill over effects of key growth sectors such as tourism and the pursuit of international trade agreements.

Support for Leopard Conservation efforts
	
?
he age-old conflict between humans and animals poses a significant threat to the co-existence of both groups and requires tangible solutions to ensure each survives.? ?
To contribute towards this endeavour the Alliance Finance Company PLC (AFC) has signed up with the Wilderness and Wildlife Conservation Trust (WWCT), founded by well known ecologist and conservationist Anjali Watson and her husband, Dr Andrew Kittle, to foster co-existence in the Central Highlands of Sri Lanka among people and leopards, the largest cat in the country.? ?
The third oldest finance company in Sri Lanka with a focus on three bottom-line principals -- people, planet and profit -- will provide financial assistance towards the pioneering couple?s project and adopt the upcountry leopard as brand ambassador for bio-diversity. The deal was sealed between AFC Managing Director Romani de Silva and Anjali Watson of WWCT at a function at the company?s head office in Colombo.? ?
??When you speak of leopards, everyone thinks of places like Yala or Wilpattu,? reflected Ms Watson. ?But no one gives consideration to Sri Lanka?s Central Highlands which is home to a sizeable population of the country?s leopards.?? ?
The region abounds with lush tea plantations and local communities that work on those estates. Watson and Kittle?s extensive research there has helped focus attention on a ridge in the Central Highlands where, they say, conservation efforts would not only help protect the leopard population but ensure maintenance of the ecosystem and biodiversity. This ridge is a vital catchment area for the Castlereagh and Mausakelle reservoirs.? ?

"When you speak of leopards, everyone thinks of places like Yala or Wilpattu, But no one gives consideration to Sri Lanka?s Central Highlands which is home to a sizeable population of the country?s leopards"
?
The Central Highlands was declared a World Heritage Site in 2010 because of its unique fauna and flora biodiversityand the presence of the Sri Lankan Leopard. The Peak Wilderness Sanctuary and the Reserved Forest are the largest protected areas within the Central Highlands.? ?
?The ridge will also act as a core habitat for the leopard population within the watershed area and is key to ensuring ongoing human leopard co-existence,? Watson said. WWCT?s ongoing research has identified it as being a vital connector and residential forest for the leopard. The female cats live and breed within that forest and the males use it as a part of their larger ranges.? ?
Findings to date confirm the residence of at least six females and five males with three sets of cubs, with a larger population occupying the forests adjacent to the Peak Wilderness Sanctuary. The proposed ridge corridor, therefore, will act as a vital and additional area for highland leopards.? ?
The overall study area investigated by Watson and Kittle extends from Hapugastenne in the West to Castlereagh in the North, all the way to the inside edge of the Peak Wilderness in the South and to the end of the Boganwantalawa Valley to the East.? ?
Their research and conservation efforts initially based in other parts of the Central Highlands was to include work in the Peak Wilderness sanctuary and reserve but a sudden spate of human-leopard encounters and leopard deaths in the year 2016 directed their attention towards the mixed terrains adjacent and adjoining the Peak Wilderness area.? ?
Working from the Dunkeld Conservation Station -- provided by Dilmah and Resplendent Ceylon they began to accumulate data, working with local communities to locals and setting up remote cameras?seventy of them in all?in an effort to identify these animals and their behavioural patterns.? ?

Thailand cave rescue: Boys found alive after being trapped for 10 days
	
Rescuers searching for 12 missing boys and their football coach say they have all been found alive, officials in Thailand have said.
The boys, aged between 11 and 16, and their 25-year-old coach have been trapped in the Tham Luang Nang Non cave complex in Chiang Rai province for 10 days.
Monsoon rains had poured into the jungle in the north of the country on Monday as rescuers desperately tried to save the boys.
Experts divers said they had made progress after reaching a bend where a half-mile passageway split into two directions.
Divers and rescue workers entered the passageearly on Monday after passing through a key chamber on Sunday whose high, murky waters had previously blocked their progress.
Chiang Rai governor Narongsak Osottanakorn said after the boys were found: "We found all 13 safe, we will take care of them until they can move."
The boys have been rescued after search efforts were hampered by rising water that flooded some areas of the cave complex.
Sky's Lisa Holland, who is at the cave entrance, said: "Rain is absolutely the last thing that the rescue workers need.
"Remember, those 12 missing schoolboys and their coach are believed to be trapped underground in flooded caves, so they want the water levels to go down.
"They are frantically trying to pump water out of the caves but at the same time fighting the elements - massive downpours of rain." (news.sky.com)

The Hirdaramani Group Demonstrates Responsibility  in the Fashion Industry
	
The Hirdaramani Group one of the key advocates at this week?s Responsible Fashion Summit, once again actively reinforced its credentials as one of the country?s most environmentally responsible companies through its renewed support of the Hiniduma Bio Link project.
For the second year in a row, Hirdaramani will join their international partner, the renowned clothing giant Patagonia to plant over 2,000 trees each in this groundbreaking sustainability initiative.
The key vision of the Responsible Fashion Summit is being responsible, staying accountable and keeping fashion clean. Every effort, collaboration and partnership leads to these goals while empowering all the stakeholders and creating an eco-system that facilitates changes in the industry towards the vision of responsible fashion.
Commenting on this initiative, Nikhil Hirdaramani - Director, Hirdaramani Group, said, ?Projects like the Hiniduma Bio-link gives us an opportunity to advance the sustainable fashion agenda and to do so in a manner that also protects and advances the beauty of the country. The fashion industry unfortunately is one of the world?s largest polluters, therefore it is vital for retailers, manufacturers, and all those involved in the supply chain to take the lead in building a more sustainable future.?
The first of its kind in the Asian region the Hiniduma project seeks to connect geographically separated patches of threatened rainforest, in the southwest of Sri Lanka, which hosts some of the island?s last few remaining rainforest ecosystems. The ?Hiniduma Biolink Project? is a CSR effort of the Carbon Consulting Company (CCC), to establish a biodiversity corridor between the two-large remnant disturbed rainforest patches and to conserve buffer zones around the forest edges through reforestation. The primary aim of this project is to reduce the pressure by local communities in the surrounding areas on the remaining rainforest patches, whilst as a secondary objective the project aims to enhance the livelihoods of traditional communities living in close proximity to tracts of natural forest where the biodiversity is high, but under imminent threat.
?We are greatly encouraged to have internationally recognized partners such as The Hirdaramani Group and its own partner Patagonia come forward to support the project for the second year running? said Sanith de S. Wijeyeratne - CEO, Carbon Consulting Company. ?In joining the Hiniduma project, these companies have signaled their individual commitment to participate in long term, managed and measured sustainability initiatives to further their environmental causes. Getting support on this magnitude will encouraging more projects of this nature, which are going to be ever more vital in the fight against climate change.?

120,000  uprooted by Syrian offensive -U.N. warns of catastrophe
	
?
More than 120,000 civilians have been uprooted by a Syrian army offensive in the southwest since it began last week, a war monitor said on Friday, and a senior U.N. official warned of catastrophe as they risked being trapped between warring sides.? ?
?Government forces and their allies appeared to be making significant gains in eastern Deraa province, where state media said they marched into several towns. A rebel official said opposition front lines had collapsed.? ?
?The Russian-backed offensive has killed at least 98 civilians, including 19 children, since June 19, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said.? ?
?It has also driven tens of thousands of people towards the border with Jordan and thousands more to the frontier with the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights, the UK-based monitor said.? ?
?
?Israel and Jordan - which is already hosting 650,000 Syrians - say they will not let refugees in. U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra?ad al-Hussein said there was a grave risk of many civilians being trapped between government forces, rebel groups and Islamic State militants who have a small foothold there, an outcome he said would be a ?catastrophe?.? ?
?Syrian government forces backed by Russian air power have turned their focus to the rebel-held southwest since defeating the last remaining besieged insurgent pockets, including eastern Ghouta, near Damascus. The assault has so far targeted Deraa, not rebel-held parts of nearby Quneitra province at the Golan frontier which are more sensitive to Israel.? ?
?The campaign has shattered a ?de-escalation? deal negotiated by the United States, Russia and Jordan that had mostly contained fighting in the southwest since last year.? ?

PUCSL has the mandate to amend and approve the LCLTGEP submitted by the transmission Licensee (CEB) and it is clearly mentioned in Section 43 (8) of the Sri Lanka Electricity Act. It reads that Least Cost Long-Term Generation Expansion Plan means a plan prepared by the transmission licensee and amended and approved by the Commission.
When CEB submitted the Generation Plan, PUCSL conducted two public consultations in written and oral formats to get the stakeholder views on the plan. CEB also was presented in the oral public consultation even though they did not make a presentation.??
Then PUCSL carried lengthy studies on the submitted Generation Plan and amended it based on latest fuel cost data available and to date, CEB engineers have not challenged the amended report with regard to its technical details.??
PUCSL has to be in compliance with the least cost principal laid in the Sri Lanka Electricity Act which is the condition to ensure the electricity is supplied to the nation at lowest possible cost. If you select high-cost plants combination you can?t ensure low-cost electricity. What we have done in 2017 when approving the generation plan for 2018-2037 is to be in compliance with this least cost principle. In addition, we have to adhere to the government policies. So before approving, we requested the energy policy guidelines from the Ministry of Power and Renewable Energy. Since we did not receive the general policy guidelines from the Ministry of Power, we approved the plan in compliance with the least cost principle.??
Everyone including CEB and PUCSL is bound by the policy decisions of the Government. The cancellation of Sampur coal plant was a government decision. In May 2018, the Government announced its policy on energy mix.?
Since both the PUCSL amended plan and CEB?s submitted plan were not in accordance with the policy, PUCSL gave a conditional approval for the CEB?s generation plan subjects to the accommodation of Government to Government (Natural Gas) plants and directed CEB to submit the 2019-38 plan by next April 30 adhering to the Government Policy.??
After approving the plan, CEB is responsible for implementing the plan. PUCSL is not involved with the procurement of the plants, i.e with bids, evaluation, tender calling or any of it. So. PUCSL has no power to involve with the procurement process. it is a false argument that PUCSL has vested interested when we are not involved in any part of the procurement process. Anyone can make allegations but allegations without any proofs are just words to get attention.??
?
"Recently announced government energy mix says Sri Lanka should generate 50% of energy from renewable energy sources including major hydropower stations and non-conventional renewable energy such as solar and wind"
?
?Q??Also, there is an allegation saying that PUCSL has changed the data to get the amended plan?
The Commission initially planned to conduct a separate stakeholder consultation for Input parameters of the LCLTGEP 2018-37 and issue Commission decision prior to the preparation of the plan by the CEB. This was informed to CEB on November 30, 2016. At the discussion between the CEB generation Planning Division and PUCSL staff held on December 20, 2016, as requested by the CEB and considering the time constraint on preparation of the plan, the Commission and the CEB came to agreement that the CEB would submit the input parameters for public consultation on February 1, 2017 but would prepare the plan without waiting for the Commission decision and would incorporate any changes based on public comments after preparation of the LCLTGEP. This is indicated in the minutes of the meeting sent to CEB on January 20, 2017.??
The CEB submitted the input data on February 6, 2017. The cover letter states that it is important to note that these data could be subjected to revisions/ updates in the process of formulating the Long-Term Generation Expansion Plan, and therefore this information should be considered as provisional data.?
This clearly indicates that the CEB did not expect a Commission decision for the submitted input parameters and the actual data they used for the plan was available for the Commission after submission of the draft LCLTGEP.??
The PUCSL-approved plan used fuel prices obtained from international fuel price indices, considering more recent fuel price trends. With this fuel price base, the cost of approved plan is lower than the cost of plants in the CEB base case plan.?
?
It is normal to introduce forced conditions to the model to meet network requirements, environment concerns, policy requirements etc. Even CEB has limited the sub-critical coal plants to a maximum of 900 MW in their own plan. In the planning stage PUCSL has constrained sub-critical coal plants but super critical coal plants were not constrained. Use of lower quality coal and lack of ash handling solutions were other concerns that lead to restriction on low efficient coal plants. If external costs are considered this sub-critical coal plant won?t be selected at all.??
All the changes that PUCSL made were clearly indicated in the Decision Document of PUCSL. CEB management had not questioned the decision to date but have only questioned our legal ability to amend the plan and we have replied to that.??
?
"Many countries do without coal and planning to do away with coal, it is certainly possible. CEB itself has looked at such option in their draft plan."
?
?
?Q??CEB Engineers say the lowest cost to generate power is Coal. How do you see this?
Well, the cost submission by CEB does not say so. The actual cost submission from CEB to PUCSL for December 2017 says that the cost of power generation at the Lakvijaya Coal Power Plant (LCPP) at Norochcholai is Rs. 14.75/kWh per unit. This is not PUCSL data but CEB data. So, if the Engineers are saying the data submission by the CEB is wrong but there is a big question mark because all our reports and calculations are based on CEB?s data submissions.??
Also, we have to keep in mind that LCPP was built under concessionary funding and does not include any return on equity for CEB or Government investments, which adds up at least Rs.2/kWh more. Anyhow it is more costlier than the latest tender prices for LNG (RS.14.99/kWh), wind (Rs. 10.07/kWh) and solar (Rs. 11.86/kWh). Thus, coal is no longer the cheapest option.??
?
?
?Q??After the approval is given, how does PUCSL involve in implementing the power generation plan? One of the major allegations of CEB Engineers is that PUCSL officers are pushing for private investors? plans for the generation. Your views on this...
The implantation of power generation plan is with the CEB. As I mentioned earlier, we do not involve buying power generation plants. There are clear provisions in the Electricity Act for procurement of a new generation plant, and the Secretary to Treasury can decide on the Government share on each power plant that is to be procured.??
PUCSL has no say on the ownership structure of a power plant other than checking least cost requirements and government ownership requirements in the Act if procured as identified in the approved LCLTGEP.??
?
?
" If SL would produce LNG during next decade, approximately we will be mostly based on indigenous power source which will ensure energy security."
?
?Q??Engineers and other stakeholders say that coal power generation is not risky or harmful like in the past and many ill-effects have been minimized with the application of new technology. Do you agree?
So-called clean coal technology includes carbon sequestration and that can increase the costs three-fold compared to a conventional plant. Whatever, the clean coal technology you use the production of ash is a given. Norachcholai plant does not have a proper plan for ash disposal and that has caused a lot of environmental problems.??
In the same time, I must say that PUCSL has no issues with the fuel that CEB uses for the power generation plan. PUCSL is more concerned with the Economic impact through the fuel that they use. PUCSL is not against coal or favouring another fuel. It is the cost factor that PUCSL has to look into.??
But when it comes to coal power, CEB needs to demonstrate their ability to manage environmental damage, otherwise, it will be impossible to find a location for a new coal plant.??
?
?Q??Will Sri Lanka face a power crisis in the near future and if so what is the solution?
Under severe drought and major plant failure conditions, Sri Lanka may face energy shortages. Of course, we have costly oil power as a stop-gap measure. That solution is not encouraged due to cost implications. We have to speed up implementing approved LCLTGEP to avert any possible crisis.??
?
?Q??Do you think Sri Lanka must do away with coal power generation fully in future?
If coal is cheaper than other fuels or sources, also if the Government decides, coal power plants could come into the long-term generation plans, Yes, we may have to agree with coal being in the generation. But, Sri Lanka is looking at the sustainable development which has to look into economic, environmental and social aspects of any development project, and coal power does not qualify under any of those criteria at the moment.??
?
?
"When it comes to coal power, CEB needs to demonstrate their ability to manage environmental damage, otherwise, it will be impossible to find a location for a new coal plant"
?
?
The existing coal plant can anyway supply up to 20% of the electricity demand in 2030, so we diversify to other cleaner/ and flexible options like renewable and Natural Gas and revisit the policy on coal.??
Also, I need to highlight the fact that we do not say a certain fuel is better than the other fuel. What we look at is the least economic cost and least harmful environmental impact on Sri Lanka.? ?
?
?Q??Sri Lanka has fully exploited hydropower resources and as such will have to depend on thermal power and so-called alternative or renewable energy such as wind, solar and LNG etc. if we are to fully dispense with coal power generation. Is this possible??
Yes, of course, many countries are doing without coal and planning to do away with it. Hence it is certainly possible. CEB itself has looked at such option in their draft plan.??
?
?
?Q??What are the remedial measures the PUCSL suggests to minimize environmental pollution created by the Lakvijaya Coal Power Plant in Puttalam?
There is a Committee comprising PUCSL, CEB and environmental authorities on this and they have an action plan to tackle all the issues of the plant. So, if CEB implements that plan, environmental impacts of the plant can be minimized, but it will take time and investment to produce results.??
?
?Q??Are you confident that Sri Lanka would go for commercial exploitation of natural gas in the Mannar basin in the near future?
?This is a question for PRDS, PRDS is confident and that is why they are calling for bid to develop sites.? ?
?
?Q??Sri Lanka?s future power generation depends on what?
Recently announced government energy mix says Sri Lanka should generate 50% of energy from renewable energy sources including major hydro-power stations and non-conventional renewable energy such as solar and wind. If the country will produce LNG during next decade, approximately we will be mostly based on indigenous power source which will ensure energy security.

Vijayakala sees need for LTTE in N-E
	
It is seen that there is a huge need of reorganization of the LTTE in the North and East, State Minister of Child Affairs Vijayakala Maheswaran claimed today addressing the 'Janapathi Nila Mehewara' event at the Weerasingham Hall in Jaffna.
She said that reports relating to traces of LTTE reorganizing are heard regularly as a result of the people in the North and the East not willing to discard the LTTE from their hearts.
?Now we remember how we lived before May 18, 2009. In the present conditions our main intention is to bring back the LTTE If we want to live, if we want to walk freely, if we need our children to attend schools and return back.,? she said.
She pointed out that a 6-year-old child had been raped and killed and now people feel why they appointed the present President into power.
She said that they had committed a lot to appoint the President and despite protecting the people he is working to protect party matters.
She also questioned the development carried out in the last three years in the North and East.
?We do not know what development they have done in our area. But I only thank the Government for one good thing and that is to release and return our lands to us. Other than that the Government had done nothing to us,? she said.
She also said being a minister in the present administration there is a limit that she can speak against their leader but had to cross the limit on some occasions. (Romesh Madushanka)

We're trying to resolve matters with SriLankan: Arjuna
	
Petroleum Minister Arjuna Ranatunga said today his office was trying to make every possible effort to sort out the issue with SriLankan rather than stopping the supply of aviation fuel on credit.
The minister said this to the media after attending an event at the Dadagamuwa Rajamaha Vihare in Veyangoda.
He said SriLankan airlines owed a huge amount of money to the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC).
"At the discussions, we held with SriLankan it agreed to pay the outstanding bills. But, failed to do so. If the discussions with the ministries and the secretaries also fail, I, as a subject minister, will have to discuss this matter with the Minister of Transport and Civil Aviation. If that too fails, we will have to refer the matter to the Cabinet and take a decision. We have to save SriLanka airline because it is a government institution. On previous occasions that have been court cases between State institutions. The President and the Prime Minister have instructed us to solve these matters through discussions. If we stop issuing fuel to SriLankan, it will be a big problem,? the minister said.

## Title: When Economists Blame Culture

When Economists Blame Culture
	
"The Great Depression in the 1930s, led to the emergence of Keynesian economics with social welfare policies, market controls and a greater role for the state in managing the economy"
	?
	"The key point here to draw from Schumpeter is that it is ?only a small fraction of the population? that can be entrepreneurs "
?
After almost four decades of liberalisation around the world, economic development continues to fail. These failures have been characterised by increased national debt, mounting levels of unemployment and underemployment and large numbers of people living in poverty. Yet international agencies and national policymakers continue with neoliberal economic prescriptions of austerity and market-oriented economic reforms.? ?
These economic failures have serious political repercussions from the emergence of authoritarian nationalist regimes to creating the ground for anti-minority and xenophobic attacks. Yet economists of both the neoliberal and nationalist variety are unable to analyse the root causes of the failures much less find solutions to economic crises.? ?
In the past, such economic crises led to new avenues of economic thinking. The Great Depression in the 1930s, led to the emergence of Keynesian economics with social welfare policies, market controls and a greater role for the state in managing the economy. Similarly, the rural crisis in the developing world led to the emergence of rural sociologists and development economists who sort solutions through the mobilisation of local resources, investment in rural development institutions and land reform. But today, the mainstream is stuck in the straitjacket of neoclassical economics propagating free markets, privatisation and austerity, despite the tremendous political economic fallout of the Global Economic Crisis of 2008.? ?
?
Crass moralising? ?
In Sri Lanka, billions of dollars of development aid has been poured into building large infrastructure; from the Accelerated Mahaweli Development Scheme, to the new highways and now the Port City. The IMF over the decades in Sri Lanka has initiated many structural adjustment and stabilisation programmes linked to neoliberal economic reforms. However, when such investment does not yield returns and reforms do not contribute any positive results, the development ?support? continues with more investment in infrastructure and the call for more neoliberal reforms.? ?
Eventually, when such neoliberal policies repeatedly and consistently fail, where do those economists turn to? These neoliberal economists suddenly transform into sociological and cultural analysts. They shed their so-called expertise on the factors of production and the dynamics of the market, and they spew out the most common cultural tropes about attitudinal problems, laziness and wastage in religious and community activities.? ?
This discourse of condemning the people and their culture on the other hand is confronted by the contemporary rise of authoritarian nationalists. They also condemn people and culture, but they put the blame on minorities, migrants and evil external economic forces from other countries.?
The fact is that the right wing nationalists are far better at this blame game as they target and attack sections of society both within and outside their countries, as opposed to the general rejection of people that is characteristic of the neoliberals. In the end, the result is the same, a crass moral discourse condemning people and their culture. The economic development model that is at the root of economic problems is conveniently avoided by the economists.? ?
?
Entrepreneurial silver bullet
This moral project of austerity, discipline and hard work is linked to a catch all solution of entrepreneurship. It is claimed that all people could become entrepreneurs from the small scale fishermen to the women involved in small holding agriculture.?
The market-led failures whether it is the lack of demand for certain goods or falling effective demand, it is claimed, could be addressed only if all people become entrepreneurs; people should innovate, adjust to the market and even create the necessary demand. Here, programmes of educational reform ? the new arena of neoliberal interventions ? are also geared towards producing entrepreneurs.? ?
In this context, I am not rejecting the concept of entrepreneurship alltogether, rather there is a need to contextualise the concept of entrepreneurship in the history of economic thought. It was the famous early twentieth century economist Joseph Schumpeter who wrote extensively about the theory of creative destruction in the capitalist system and the role of entrepreneurs working with the capitalists in creating innovations leading to both growth and crises in the economy.? ?
Schumpeter had the following to say about entrepreneurs in one of his important works:? ?
?We have seen that the function of entrepreneurs is to reform or revolutionize the pattern of production by exploiting an invention or, more generally, an untried technological possibility for producing a new commodity or producing an old one in a new way, by opening up a new source of supply of materials or a new outlet for products, by reorganizing an industry and so on.?
Railroad construction in its earlier stages, electrical power production before the First World War, steam and steel, the motorcar, colonial ventures afford spectacular instances of a large genus which comprises innumerable humbler ones?down to such things as making a success of a particular kind of sausage or toothbrush.?
This kind of activity is primarily responsible for the recurrent ?prosperities? that revolutionize the economic organism and the recurrent ?recessions? that are due to the disequilibrating impact of the new products or methods. To undertake such new things is difficult and constitutes a distinct economic function, first, because they lie outside of the routine tasks which everybody understands and, secondly, because the environment resists in many ways that vary, according to social conditions, from simple refusal either to finance or to buy a new thing, to physical attack on the man who tries to produce it.?
To act with confidence beyond the range of familiar beacons and to overcome that resistance requires aptitudes that are present in only a small fraction of the population and that define the entrepreneurial type as well as the entrepreneurial function.? (Schumpeter, J. A. 1943. Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy, Page 132)? ?
The key point here to draw from Schumpeter is that it is ?only a small fraction of the population? that can be entrepreneurs. Furthermore, entrepreneurs for Schumpeter take many risks, swim against the current, have intellectual social capital and rely on the capitalists? support to make innovations a reality.? ?
?
?
"The IMF over the decades in Sri Lanka has initiated many structural adjustment and stabilisation programmes linked to neoliberal economic reforms"
?
How did the contemporary discourse about entrepreneurship get it so wrong? When they push entire population to become entrepreneurs, the entire economic risk and burden are placed on those individuals and their households. When so-called entrepreneurship in the form of mono-cropping in villages for cut flowers or seaweed cultivation fails for such rural folk due to market fluctuations, they are pushed to utter poverty and even starvation.? ?
This is not just the creative destruction with business cycles leading to economic booms and downturns characteristic of the capitalist system that Schumpeter analysed, but rather the negligent and cruel abandoning of already marginalised sections of society to be drowned by market forces. Meanwhile, the neoliberal economists blame the people and their culture for their economic predicament, and avoid responsibility for their failed economic models of development.? ?
