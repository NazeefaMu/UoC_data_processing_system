AG's Department tarnishing my image: Ravi
	
Foreign Affairs Minister Ravi Karunanayake speaking to the media after testifying before the Presidential Commission appointed to probe the Central Bank bond issue said that the Attorney Generals Department was hell-bent on tarnishing his image by calling him before the Commission.
Minister Karunanayake also claimed that certain media houses had tried to hang him without trial but he was able to prove his innocence before the Commission yesterday (2).
Certain media houses tried to hang me even without a trial. I proved them wrong. I have to say that the officers of the Attorney Generals Department are also trying to tarnish my image and capitalize on it to climb the ladder. They have created a situation where we now find it difficult to have any privacy. We came to power to restore a good governance and run a clean administration. I am one of those that contributed greatly towards this effort. I maintained a clean administration in the Finance Ministry.
These are consequences of certain misdeeds carried out by our own fellow politicians. That is the biggest challenge I have ever faced. I can say at this moment that the truth will come out soon. It cannot be concealed. Some media institutions have also tarnished my image for no reason. It is now upto you to correct this injustice. What I have revealed here will be proved. I ask you to look into this. A wrong impression has been created with regards to the ownership of a penthouse. I had my home in close proximity to Parliament even before I entered politics. These are not new things, he said.
He charged that the Attorney Generals Department was chasing after those who were pursuing good governance instead of going after thieves. I am happy today because the Attorney Generals Department was able to question a powerful minister of this government. What could have happened if this had occurred during the reign of the previous regime They would have gone in white vans. We were harassed when we were in the Opposition. When we came to power, our character is assassinated. What have we done wrong I answered all the questions truthfully. I have nothing to hide, he said.
Responding to a question raised by journalists that he had told the commission that he had not known about Arjun Aloysius paying the rental for the penthouse for nine months, the minister said that was a lie. "That is not what I said", he said.
It is something my family bought temporarily. When it was revealed in Parliament, We revealed the true story. It is only then that it became news, Karunanayake said.
When asked if there was a case of conflict of interest in all of this, he said there was no conflict of interest and added that it wasnt he who had bought the penthouse in question.
When journalists questioned as to what difference it made whether it was him or his asked if his family that bought the penthouse, he answered no payment was made. They reimbursed the payment. (Ajith Siriwardana)

Amana Bank June profit up on stretched margins but sour loans expand
	
Amana Bank PLC, Sri Lankas first non-interest based Islamic bank reported an earnings of 7 cents a share or Rs.85.2 million for its most recent quarter ended in June 30, 2017 (2Q17) as it managed to stretch its margins but the doubtful and sour loans increased, the interim results showed.
The bank with an asset base of little under Rs.57 billion gave only Rs.1.7 billion in new loans during the first six months of the financial year and mobilized deposits of Rs.2.3 billion.
The bank has a loan book of Rs.40.4 billion and a deposit portfolio of Rs.49.2 billion. 
The banks net financing income or the net income between the cost and the yield of its liabilities and the assets rose by a strong 38.5 percent year-on-year (YoY) to Rs.634.2 million as the bank was able to stretch its net interest margin from 3.6 percent to 3.9 percent during the 6- months to June 30.
The net fee and commission income grew by a little under 7.0 percent yoy to Rs.54.2 million.
The trading gains almost doubled from Rs.57.2 million to Rs.108.9 million.
Meanwhile, the bank made provisions of Rs.107 million against the possible bad loans during the quarter against only Rs.3.3 million provisions made during the corresponding quarter last year.
The sour loan portfolio also grew during the period as the gross non-performing loan ratio has risen to 1.47 percent from 0.89 percent in December 2016, albeit remaining well below the industry average of around 2.7 percent. 
The bank in July raised Rs.4.75 billion in fresh equity through a rights issue which propped up the banks core capital to Rs.10.0 billion, the minimum required by the Central Bank by January 1, 2018 for those few who sought extended time frame to meet the requirement.
The negotiated share deal saw IB Growth Fund (IBGF), together with its ultimate parent company and the banks 4th largest shareholder, Islamic Development Bank (IDB) increasing their stake up to 29.97 percent stake in the bank. 
Before the rights issue, the banks tier I and tier II capital adequacy ratios stood at 10.4 percent and 10.8 percent respectively. 
Meanwhile, for the 6 months ended June 30, 2017, the bank reported an earnings of 12 cents a share or Rs.151.8 million, up 170 percent from a year ago.

An epoch making prelate
	
Sri Lanka, from the time of inception of Buddhism, has been a very fortunate country. One reason for this is that from time to time there appeared epoch making religious leaders who succeeded in instilling hope in the minds of Buddhists.
They have also been able to inspire and direct the devotees to follow the right path. In Most Venerable Aggamaha Pandita Kotugoda Dhammavasa Maha Nayaka Thero- the newly appointed the Supreme Maha Nayaka Thero of Sri Lanka Anarapura Maha Nikaya- we see such a great religious dignitary. With his impeccable and most exemplary conduct he epitomizes what true monkhood is. This great religious personality hails from Kotugoda, a comparatively less-known suburb of the Gampaha District. Kotugoda has now shot into fame due to the fame that the monk now holds. 
Early life
The well-to-do family of Endavitharanage Haramanis Rodrigo and Selestina Rodrigo happened to live a pious life. The couple had six siblings; four sons and two daughters. A new male sibling joined this family on January 21 in 1933, bringing much joy to this family.
The elated parents named this youngest sibling Endavitharanage Sirimevan Rodrigo. Being the youngest, he was the darling of everyone. In spite of being over-petted, Sirimevan turned out to be an extremely obedient child. He sowed lot of restraint and maturity, traits not normally seen in most other children of his age.
Primary education
The parents, being devoted Buddhists, had close contact with the village temple. As a result Sirimevan received his first initiation to learn from the chief incumbent of the village temple, Ven. Kotugoda Pemananda Nayaka Thero. His formal primary education commenced with his admission to the Buddhist Mixed School in Kotugoda, which was run by the Buddhist Theosophical Society.
This school is now well-known as Kotugoda Rahula Maha Vidyalaya. This marked a very crucial period in his life. It was in 1948 August 17 that teenager Sirimevan obtained admission to the monk community as a novice. This was as the consequence of the close friendship between Ven. Kotugoda WimalaratanaThero and Ven.
Unavatune Dhammapala Thero, the chief incumbent of the Sri Dharmapalamaya, Mt. Lavinia. Obtaining discipleship under Ven. Unavatune Dhammapala Thero, the novice monk came to be known as Kotugoda Dhammavasa and came to reside at Sri Dharmapalaramaya,Mt. Lavinia. 
Secondary education: 
While residing in this Viharaya he continued his religious studies at the Paramadhamma Cetiya Pirivena in Ratmalana, which he entered in 1952. Then he joined the Vidyodaya Pirivena, Maligakanda, where he continued his studies in Tripitaka and such oriental languages as Pali and Sanskrit. This gave him the opportunity of meeting and receiving instructions from erudite scholar monks of the time such as Most Ven. Kalukondayawe Pannasekara Nayaka Thero, Most Ven. Welivitiye Sorata Nayaka Thero, Most Ven. Walane Satthissara Nayaka Thero, Most Ven. Parawahera Vajiranana Nayaka Thero and many others. His association with Vijiraramaya Temple and his great admiration for Most Ven. Narada Maha Thero and Ven. Piyadassi Thero made him get involved in Buddhist missionary activities. 
Young Ven. Kotugoda Dhammavasas higher ordination took place in 1954, July 10th. On this occasion Most Ven. Beruwala Sri Sumangala Siriniwasa Maha Nayaka Thero functioned as the Upajjhaya, Most Ven. Ambalangoda Dhammakusala Maha Nayaka Thero, Most Ven. Moratuwe Sasanaratana Anunayaka Thero and Most Ven. Moratuwe Pemaratana Thero served as the Karmacarya.
With his impeccable and most exemplary conduct he epitomizes what true monkhood is.
Scholarly contribution 
With the obtaining of higher ordination a marked change took place in Ven. Kotugoda Dhammavasa Theros life. He became more scholarly. He started writing articles on relevant Buddhist subjects. These contributions that he made started around 1960s. These efforts made it possible for him to publish much readable articles in Sinhala. These were widely read and appreciated by pious devotees. With the establishment of the Bauddhodaya Association at the Dhammapalaramaya Temple in Dehiwala, he began publishing annually, a Vesak journal, which he got distributed free among the devotees. 
He published a fair number of booklets for the purpose of developing faith in the ordinary followers. Among these are: Nivanata Maga, Ketumati Rajadhaniya, Kosala Raja Sihina, Dhammo Have Rakkhati Dhammacari etc. His writing greatly appealed to the people because of the serene style in which he presented them. He used lucid language, citing events and insights drawn from the Tripitaka, the Jataka book etc. Besides, he often contributed very readable and inspiring articles using the Sinhala language to the popular Sinhala newspapers which were eagerly read. 
Missionary activities
The great impact Ven Narada Nayaka Thero had on him made him earnestly commit himself to missionary activities. Being much influenced by reputed missionary monks from Sri Lanka such as Most Ven. Narade Maha Thero and Ven. Piyadassi Maha Thero, this monk followed in their footsteps. He toured a number of countries like India, Nepal, China, Japan, Germany, America, Pakistan, Thailand and Myanmar to preach and teach the Dharma, spread Buddhism and fill the hearts and minds of the listeners with serene joy. Besides, he even took recovery steps to establish temples in Myanmar, Nepal, thus further bolstering his missionary work.
Sought-after preacher 
Most Ven. Kotugoda Dhammavasa Maha Nayaka Thero is admired and appreciated by Local Buddhists as one of the most appealing preachers in the country. He had this potential from his younger days, a talent which he cultivated. This is one factor which has made him a sought after preacher. He used his knowledge of Dhamma and blended it with the discipline he maintained. He could keep the audience spell-bound with his soft, lucid and ear-pleasing speech. He was able to communicate most suitable doctrinal points in a very simple way. Hence his diary was ever-filled with invitations to visit temples, scattered all over the island, to preach the doctrine. The listeners not only appreciated his preaching, but generously made donation to establish temples. One of these temples is named Upali Dharmasramaya and is situated in Kataragama. Its this preaching ability of his that made him win over many. With their generosity he developed the Sri Dhamrmapalaramaya to the state it is at present. He used the electronic media too for proper preaching.
He published a fair number of booklets for the purpose of developing faith in the ordinary followers. Among these are: Nivanata Maga, Ketumati Rajadhaniya, Kosala Raja Sihina, Dhammo Have Rakkhati Dhammacari etc
Tireless service
With maturity, especially after his attainment of higher ordination, he showed a growing dedication to work and uplift the Sasana. Tirelessly he went to every nook and corner of the island preaching and teaching. He dedicated his whole life to serve the Sasana and foster the Sri Lanka Amarapura Maha Nikaya. The Most. Ven. Kosgoda Dhammavansa Maha Nayaka Thero, who noticed the commitment of Ven. Kotugoda Dhammavasa Nayaka Thero, proposed to him to accept this co-secretary-ship of the Sangha Council. This he humbly accepted and discharged all duties expected of him to the best of his ability. In appreciation of his great services his position was elevated to the position of Secretary General. He served in this capacity for many years. 
From this position he succeeded to the position of President of the Sangha Council. After many years of service in this position he was made Mahopadhyaya. Then, when the supreme Maha Nayaka position fell vacant following the passing away of Most Ven. Davuldena Nanissara, Most Venarable Aggamahapanditha Kotugoda Dhammavasa Maha Nayaka Thero was unanimously appointed as the Supreme Maha Nayakaof the Sri Lanka Amarapura Maha Nikaya. This appointment was made on May 26 this year.  This long journey towards success is evidenced by various honorific ecclesiastical titles awarded to him. Among these honorific titles are: Saddharmakirti Sri Tripitaka Visharada, Pravacana Kirti Sri Sasana Shobhana, Sri Sumangala Vidyavatansaka,Aggamaha Pandita etc.

Central Bank conducts first treasury bonds auction under new system
	
The CBSL conducted its first Treasury Bond auction under the new issuance system on July 27th.
The new transparent hybrid system draws on the strengths of a market based auction system, while accommodating the compulsions of having to raise Rs 1 trillion worth of bonds in a relatively thin market to meet the governments borrowing requirement in 2018.
The details of the new system were set out in the CBSL Press Release titled  New Primary issuance System for Treasury Bonds, dated 25th July, which is available on the Central Banks website.
Two maturities, i.e., 4 years 11 months and 9 years and 10 month were offered at the first auction to raise Rs 22bn on a face value basis. The amount offered under each ISIN was fully subscribed in the 1st phase itself at very favorable rates. The 4 years 11 months maturity was oversubscribed by 2.7 times while 9 years 10 months maturity was oversubscribed by 2.9 times. A favorable bidding pattern was observed with a minimum number of off market bids showing a high competitiveness at the auction. The weighted average yield rates dropped by 99 bps with respect to 4 years 11 months maturity and by 78 bps with respect to 9 years 10 months maturity when compared with the corresponding previous auctions held on 09.05.2017 and 11.07.2017 respectively for the two maturities.

Embassy, mosque attacks fuel fears ISIS bringing Iraq war to Afghanistan
	



REUTERS, 2 August, 2017 - Attacks on the Iraqi embassy and a Shiite mosque in Afghanistan have reinforced fears that Islamic State militants are seeking to bring the groups Middle East conflict to Central Asia, though evidence of fighters relocating from Iraq and Syria remains elusive. 
The choice of target in the Iraqi embassy attack, three weeks after the fall of Mosul to Iraqi troops, appeared to back up repeated warnings from Afghan security officials that, as Islamic State fighters were pushed out of Syria and Iraq, they risked showing up in Afghanistan.  The United States, which first came to Afghanistan in 2001 after Al Qaedas attacks on New York and Washington, is considering sending more troops to Afghanistan, in part to ensure the country does not become a haven for foreign militant groups. 
In April, during a visit to Kabul by U.S. Defence Secretary James Mattis, the commander of NATO forces in Afghanistan, Gen. John Nicholson, said that, while ISIS had an aspiration to bring in fighters from Syria, we havent seen it happen.

Flooding can be MINIMISED through technology
	
IWMI invents simple tech device to control water related risks and disasters

Nature gave us a few powerful lessons in the guise of droughts, landslides and floods which drove hundreds of people living in some parts of the country to enormous suffering in recent past. While the rest of the world is using the latest technology to minimize harm from natural disasters, we are still lagging behind. If there were ways to decrease the damage caused by natural disasters, many precious lives and property could have been saved.
Yann Chemin, an International Water Management Institute (IWMI) scientist has invented a simple device - a weather station to monitor the accurate rainfall data, in real time. The data can be used to manage the water in tanks and reservoirs avoiding flood hazard and controlling water
related disasters. 
The device uses open source technology and can be operated even by the farmers themselves, and not only the rainfall but also the parameters such as temperature, wind speed, wind direction and atmospheric pressure too can be measured. And it could be assembled with the locally available parts and accessories and would cost between Rs. 45,000 to Rs.75,000. Paddy cultivators in the flood affected areas could save their crops by taking timely precautions to harvest
before the rains. 
bove all, the device could be very useful to the reservoir monitors, who could use this data, which is sent to their mobile phones as text messages about the inflow of water to the tanks, and simultaneously the volume of water that needed to be released to the canals. Thus, the flooding could be controlled and the farmers could save their yield. 
In Sri Lanka, the weather data is measured by the Meteorological Department in World Meteorological Organization (WMO) certified technology. The Met. Department issues the rainfall data on daily and sometimes hourly basis, and it is calculated on mm scale.
During an interview with the Daily Mirror, Soumya Balasubramanya, a researcher - Environmental
Economics - International Water Management Institute (IWMI) spoke extensively about the water related disasters, monitoring of tanks/reservoirs and the role the weather station plays to caution about floods etc. The excerpts:
Q What is the purpose of inventing this equipment and how could the data be used to minimize damage causedby floods
Monitoring accurate measurements of water level helps avoid flooding. Especially in tanks and reservoirs in Anuradhapura, the daily-basis information is not sufficient, to manage the water and reduce the harm during the rainy season. All the rain water in the upstream, pour down into tanks and reservoirs. The tank monitors dont know the volume of water that comes into the tanks. If they know the accurate rainfall at the upstream, they can calculate the volume in the downstream. APura town gets flooded every year due to this heavy rainfall. If the tank monitors have had access to the real time data, the hourly intensity of rainfall, he could open the sluice gates to send the water flowing through the canals and would create enough space to receive the inflow. That is the purpose of this weather station.
Not only Sri Lanka, many other countries use this technology to warn against flooding. Earlier the Pakistani Met. Dept had been using this to caution the people about floods in the Indus Valley
Q What is the importance of collecting real time data 
Tank monitors do not need daily data, but hourly rainfall figures, especially during the rainy season in Anuradhapura. They have no other means of getting that information as the Met. Dept. issues only the daily rainfall data. So we created this device to measure the daily intensity of rainfall in real time. We have programmed the weather stations with SMS facility, so it sends a message to the tank monitors mobile phones in the event of more than 10 mm rain per hour, as requested by the
Irrigation Department. 
The Nachchaduwa tank is situated in a regular flooding area, and the IWMI and the Irrigation Dept. are piloting and testing the technology in Nachchaduwa tank, installing five weather stations there, through a UK and World Bank-funded project. 
During heavy rains, there is nobody at the Met. Dept. to gauge the rainfall. Even if it rains, an officer has to go all the way to the Dept. just to report about the measures.  
Q How user-friendly is this device 
Anyone can download the manual, buy local parts and assemble stations and develop it. Lanka Rain Water Harvesting Forum (LRWHF) and several other institutions are doing similar projects. We trained the LRWHF team, and they have used this device and modified it. 
The University of Moratuwa worked with us, they developed our technology and they have commercialized it. Even the SANASA (a local bank that works closely with people) built these devices and installed in their branches to gather information on drought and flooding. 
Not only Sri Lanka, many other countries use this technology to warn against flooding. Earlier the Pakistani Met. Dept had been using this to caution the people about floods in the Indus Valley.
People could reduce the damage caused by floods if they observe and comply with the data provided by weather stations. Farmers in other countries are widely using this device. All the necessary accessories could be bought from the local market. 
Q What kind of assistance does the IWMI get from the govt institutions 
The govt is working closely with us. We had discussions with the COSTI (Coordinating Secretariat for Science Technology and Innovation). Weather patterns are changing so dramatically in Sri Lanka, COSTI is very keen on collecting these weather data, and these devices could be used to gather all that data to observe the accurate changes in weather pattern. The University of Moratuwa, the best technical university in Sri Lanka has the capacity to develop this. We work with so many other teams here to create capacity and developthis technology. 
We have support from the Irrigation Dept, COSTI, University of Moratuwa, LRWHF who are very enthusiastic about these projects. Moratuwa University is linking all the stations to one network in a three-year project. We are working closely with them so they can improvise themselves. Anyone who has the basic knowledge of computers could develop this technology. We are targeting policy makers, rather than those who are working directlywith people. 
Helps reservoir monitors to manage water levels accordingly
	Many countries use this to monitor weather conditions
	Accessories freely available in local markets
Q Whose brainchild was this weather station 
Yaan Chemin, a scientist working in IWMI created this device, shown to the University of Moratuwa who are now developing and enhancing it further. We are very happy over it. Many people have picked it up and developed. 
The weather stations are assembled with locally available parts using local labour. This project was a result following a request made by the Irrigation Dept, which started it in early 2015. The Dept wanted hourly rainfall data to manage the tanks and handle the sudden release of water from the tanks. The Dept has been using a station in Batticaloa to monitor the water level in the reservoir to open/close thesluice gates. 
A number of other countries in the world are also using this technology. Togo, as an example, uses it to measure the water levels in sewers and clean them before the rains come. Tanzania also uses this technology to measure the water levels in reservoirs andimprove dams. 
Q What is IWMI 
The International Water Management Institute (IWMI) is a non-profit, scientific organization focusing on the sustainable use of water and land resources in developing countries. It is headquartered in Colombo with regional offices across Asia and Africa. IWMI works in partnership with the govt, civil society and the private sector to develop scalable agriculture water management solution that have a real impact on poverty reduction, food security, eco-system and health. IWMI is a member of CGIAR System Organization, a global research partnership for a food secure future and leads the CGIAR research programme on water, land and eco-systems.

## Title: Getting (out of) Sinhala movies

Getting (out of) Sinhala movies
	
When movies, the only art which everyone felt free to enjoy and have opinions about, lose their connection with song and dance, drama, and the novel, when they become cinema, which people fear to criticise just as they fear to say what they think of a new piece of music or a new poem or painting, they will become another object of academic study and appreciation, and will soon be an object of excitement only to practitioners of the art.(Pauline Kael)
There is a young man whom I know, pretty much like the young man from last weeks piece, who is into Sinhala movies. I met him quite by accident, I didnt know of his existence until he began besieging me with one query after another, and about two months after we made our first acquaintance, its safe to say that I have not come across a person that age who is so enthusiastic about our cinema. Now I dont know much about him, except his name (which I wont divulge) and his home town (which doesnt matter). He has his views and opinions on the movies and all guesses are that they dont coincide with mine. For the record, they dont. 
Whod have thought that a film like Ho Gana Pokuna was possible five years ago Who indeed The young, of course! 
Where we agree with each other, however, is the point that for our movies to evolve, the dichotomy between what is arty and what is commercial must be done away with. 
None of our directors, and none of our films, could be considered as perfect. The same could be said of directors and films from elsewhere from other industries. Even those which (and who) top those greatest ever lists  and there hasnt been a lack of them here or there, then or now  arent really flawless. What is good and bad and pedestrian, as I implied earlier, depends on the values a critic or an audience ascribes to them. The problem isnt that what is good for me may not be good for you. Rather, the problem is that when it comes to our film industry, the critics more often than not define good and bad and draw an artificial barrier between the two. 
Such a barrier thrives in the long term on that equally deplorable barrier between High Art and Low Art. On that basis, some movies are praised while others are neglected. Nidhanaya was Art, for instance, while Kawuda Raja was not. Lester James Peries is the epitome of good cinema, while K. A. W. Perera is at best a storyteller, a magician. In another country, being a magician might have been enough for an aspiring director, but in Sri Lanka, the evolution of our cinema has been from the French to East Europeans. Any director who treads beyond these two is hailed as a magician, a middle-of-the-road cineaste. But a serious film maker he/she is not. 
Palagetiyo is spontaneous. There is a freshness in it that moves, that affirms, that saddens
I am not saying Kawuda Raja is a great work of art. Its not art, but its not Low Art either. And I am not saying that K. A. W. Perera was a great director. But just the other day I was watching Janaka Saha Manju (for the third or fourth time, I cant remember) and I was wondering why, when our hero meets his lover for the first time, Manju was clutching a doll for no comprehensible reason. Then it hit me: the fact that I was entranced by their conversation and everything which followed, despite the absurdity of it all, meant that Perera had done something which none of those who venerate High Art could or can do. Keep me intrigued. 
When the movies become cinema, i.e. something to be intellectualised, critics dont know what to praise and what to dislike, or for that matter the criterion one uses to do that. When we are made to appreciate a movie by the fact of its being serious, arty, controversial, you-name-it, we dont really react to it. I am not entirely sure whether we need to appreciate a work of art, come to think of it. If appreciation is all it took for a movie to prosper, whether at the box-office or with the critics, and if appreciation can be falsified or faked, then what can one hope for in our industry 
I suppose this could explain to a considerable extent at least, why our critics are persistent in categorising a film maker like H. D. Premaratne as an exponent of the Mada Mawatha. What they forget, and what those who dote on them forget, is that in the cinema, as with pretty much every other art form, there is no Mada Mawatha. The road never bifurcates on its own. It is bifurcated. This differentiation between High Art and Low Art, therefore is denied validity when considering the criterion our critics use in defining the worth of a Premaratne. For they know art, and what they churn out is preferable to the purveyors of art cinema, but they also know what sells, visually and verbally. They dont apologise for that, because they know they dont have to. 
The fundamental base of our movies was their affirmation of a narrative that parsed. That is what differentiates the early work of Vasantha Obeyesekera, which culminated with Palagetiyo, and his later work, which met its worst nadir with Maruthaya. The latter is, to be sure, thematically an extension of the former. Obeyesekera goes for the same basic plot line: the idealistic rich schooled in bitter reality and poverty. 
But Palagetiyo is spontaneous. There is a freshness in it that moves, that affirms, that saddens. The final sequence, when Sarath and Kusum spend the last of their savings so that Kusum can relive her former life of comfort and ease back in his village, for one day, is insanely poignant. Maruthaya, in contrast, is discernibly manufactured, with characters defined as types rather than as human beings. And yet, if the writers of profiling Sri Lankan cinema are anything to go by, it supposedly showed an uncanny ability to recapture on screen the density of social specification. Whats forgotten here is that what one gains in density, one can often lose in substance.
French discovered the movies, and the Americans improved on it and gave it that pulpy, commercial flavour which continues even today
Its easy to see why critics conveniently forget all these points, important as they are. They dont just forego on rationality in criticism, they seem to despise it. How else can you explain the many reactions that a movie like Oba Nathuwa Oba Ekka got, which owing to the political prejudices of its reviewers was made out to be a simplistic battle between the bad Sinhalese and the good Tamils The chauvinists werent any better: they considered it as an equally simplistic attack on their history, their heritage. What then is one left to hope for, when all film criticism has to offer here are platitudes based on political and/or personal biases Isnt this exactly what compels that aforementioned dichotomy between High Artand Low Art 
Thats why so many of our critics are predictable in their tastes. They know, through some strange clairvoyant power, what sells and what is marketable in the media or elsewhere. They dont feel or understand art cinema, but the moment they betray that they dont, theyll be put down. They choose to ignore the many technical and logistical mistakes in a movie for that reason, which is why, when they went to town with every adjective from the dictionary to praise Let Her Cry, they chose not to dwell on those manifestly crude incongruities in its plot line. (Who can forget, as I tried to but could not, the sound of the pages of the script being turned over by Rithika Kodithuwakku during her phone conversation with Swarna Mallawarachchi) 
When the movies become cinema, i.e. something to be intellectualised, critics dont know what to praise and what to dislike, or for that matter the criterion one uses to do that
I think theres a fundamental problem in our industry. The young are there, making the waves and experimenting in exciting ways, and they dont seem to be deteriorating. But the old are being too cynical. Whod have thought, for instance, that the same person who directed Arumosam Wehi (which went unnoticed and was probably the liveliest childrens movie made here at the time) would win his stakes through Adaraneeya Kathawak Whod have thought that a film like Ho Gana Pokuna was possible five years ago Who indeed The young, of course! 
When the French discovered the movies, and the Americans improved on it and gave it that pulpy, commercial flavour which continues even today, the critics werent worried about art. The earliest critics, like James Agee, who preceded the greatest critic of them all, Pauline Kael, reacted to films. They didnt need to appreciate them. Somewhere in the seventies, however, we chose to appreciate, to be so worked up about our preconceived notions of Good Art and Bad Art that we didnt have room for any other criterion. Sri Lanka took three decades to catch up with this. And so I conclude: our film critics, unlike that young man I met the other day, are 30 years behind. The world has moved on. So have the movies. We have not. Sad.

GMOA wants Commission to probe SAITM issue
	
The Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) today said that a Commission which was similar to the Presidential Commission of Inquiry (PCoI) on the Bond issue should be established to investigate Minister Rajitha Senaratne over the SAITM issue.
GMOA Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge told a news conference that the govt was attempting to stand for South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) Chairman Dr. Neville Fernando by enduring all his losses.
The govt has approved all the proposals which are biased towards Dr. Fernando. Who will bear the financial loss incurred by the state through these actions he queried.
The GMOA condemned the pro - SAITM behaviour of Minister Senaratne and added that the minister was handling public funds as a property of his own.
Dr. Aluthge also said at present there were Presidential Commissions to investigate on actions of several ministers with regard to the alleged Central Banks (CB) Bond scam and added that a similar Commission should be immediately established to probe Minister Senaratne.
Dr. Fernando can do more things by spending a large sum of money, he said. (By Kalathma Jayawardhane)

The Government had sought to amend Assistance to and Protection of Victims of Crime and Witnesses Act, providing for recording of statements of evidence from a witness outside Sri Lanka but within the premises of the countrys diplomatic missions, it is learnt.
The Act, originally introduced after the new Government assumed office, provided for such recording only within Sri Lanka.
If the proposed amendment were incorporated, it would provide for any witness living outside the county to testify within the premises of respective mission.
Where any evidence or statement of any victim of crime or witness is to be recorded from any remote location outside Sri Lanka under subsection (1), it shall be recorded at the Sri Lankan diplomatic mission in the country from where such victim of crime or witness seeks to testify or make the statement, the draft bill says.

Modi flagged concerns with SL over fishermen issue: Swaraj
	
Indian External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj on Thursday said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi has consistently flagged India's concerns over the detention of fishermen with the Government of Sri Lanka, the ANI reported.
"The fishermen matter was raised in each meeting of Prime Minister Modi with Sri Lankan President and Prime Minister. Same has resulted in the release of 42 boats and 251 fishermen," Swaraj has told Indian Parliament.
Leader of the Indian Communist Party and Rajya Sabha member of Tamil Nadu D. Raja questioned Swaraj as to what measures the government is taking to release Indian fishermen arrested by the Sri Lankan Navy.
He also asked the number of fishermen arrested by the Sri Lankan Navy.
"Whether it is fact that Sri Lankan Navy continues to arrest Indian fishermen and they have lately arrested fishermen from Mandapam and confiscated their two trawlers on charges of engaging in bottom trawling. What is the number of fishermen and trawlers in their custody and what measures are being taken to get them released," he asked Swaraj.
Last month, at least seven Indian fishermen were reportedly arrested by the Sri Lanka Navy for trespassing Sri Lankan waters.
The fishermen from Mandapam near Rameswaram were fishing at Neduntheevu Island in the Palk Straits, close to the coast of Sri Lanka.
Sri Lanka recently passed a bill that allows the authorities to imprison bottom-trawling fishermen for two years and fine of Rs. 50,000.

Netanyahu calls off fistfight between Israeli, Jordanian lawmakers
	
REUTERS, 2 August 2017 - Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stopped an Israeli lawmaker from taking on a Jordanian counterpart in a fist-fight on Wednesday over a diplomatic crisis between the two neighbours. 
Oren Hazan, a member of Netanyahus rightist Likud party had tweeted on the day of the shooting that Jordanians who we keep supplied with water and whose butts we defend day and night needed re-education. 
His comments prompted a challenge from a similarly fiery lawmaker in Jordan. Let him meet me, if he is a man, Yahya Soud said on Twitter. 
As the appointed time neared, both men posted images of themselves on social media driving to the King Hussein/Allenby Bridge crossing between Jordan and the Israeli-occupied West Bank. 
But Hazans journey was cut short after Netanyahus office ordered him to turn around. A statement from the prime ministers office did not say why Netanyahu had stopped the fight from proceeding. 
In 1994, Jordan became the second of only two Arab countries to make peace with Israel.

The government had approved the proposed new regulations to control the use of Air weapons in protecting cultivations from wild animals.
Addressing the Media at the Government information Department Cabinet Spokesman and Minister Gayantha Karunatilaka said using air weapons had been alleged to be used in hunting wild animals.
The proposal was made by Sustainable Development and Wild life Minister Gamini Jayawickreme Perera to implement new regulations.
The new recommendations as follows:
Examine the possibility of producing an air rifle with low power instead of present 0.22 mm rifle and encourage producing of an air rifle that can drive away animals by sound and regulation of issuing 0.22 mm air rifles and include them in Firearms Ordinance.
The proposed recommendations include following alternatives such as controlling animals through biological methods, limitation of using pesticides, use of modern scientific methods to control the damage caused by wild animals, use of traditional methods used in driving away wild animals by developing with modern technology, minimizing waste disposal in open areas that causes the attraction of wild animals, and Limit the importation of materials used in producing Hakkapatas.

The no-confidence motion signed by 32 Joint Opposition MPs against Foreign Affairs Minister Ravi Karunanayake was handed over to the General Secretary of Parliament this afternoon.
The motion was submitted by a group of MPs led by MP Bandula Gunawardena.
Deputy Secretary General of Parliament Neil Iddawala confirmed that a No Confidence Motion had been received against the Minister.
He told the Daily Mirror that a large group of Joint Opposition MPs came and handed over the motion at the Speaker's Office.
He said it would be placed on the Order Book by the Speaker.
As per the Parliamentary practice, when a No-Confidence Motion is handed over against a Minister or an MP, it is normally given precedence over other matters.
A No-Confidence Motion lapses on the prorogation of the House.
MP Mahindananda Aluthgamage said the Minister should resign forthwith rather than waiting to be unseated after a vote of No-Confidence based on this motion.
He said the allegations against the Minister were serious.

PCoI gives order preventing Aloysius accessing Apple account
	
In the wake of a revelation made by the Attorney Generals Department over the alleged attempt into access Arjun Aloysius Apple account through his wifes phone, the PCoI today delivered a two-fold order preventing Arjun Aloysius or any agent on his behalf, accessing his Apple account or tampering its information.
The Commission said despite there being no particular section in the Commission of Inquiry Act over such an order, the order was given under the inherent and consequential powers vested in the Commission.
The Commission said it was also conscious about the fact of privacy involved in such a situation and was of the view that such order was given in expectation of preventing the delay of the investigation since the alleged tampering would do so.
The Commission was also concerned that there would be appropriate legal consequences under the Penal Code, if relevant parties were unable to comply with the order.
While delivering the order, Justice Prasanna Jayawardena informed the counsel appearing on behalf of Mr. Aloysius that any act which had helped Aloysius accessing the Apple account would also come under Section 100 and 102 (aiding and abetting) of the Penal Code and would be a punishable offence.
Earlier, it was revealed that Mr. Aloysius had refused to give his Apple password to the CID officers while he was recording statements with them.
And later the counsel appearing on behalf of him informed the Commission that Mr. Aloysius does not remember the password.
However, on an earlier occasion, ASG Yasantha Kodagoda said that the investigators had found that someone has logged into Aloysius Apple account through his wifes phone which had a Singaporean number. (Shehan Chamika Silva)

When asked about Minister Ravi Karunanayake claiming before the Commission that he knew nothing, Mr. Dissanayake said some people who were summoned before the Commission had become speechless and said that they utter something to get away.
They say such things maybe because they are unaware of something or maybe they do not like to accept the allegation. But the judges at the Commission ask those questions with evidence at hand, he said.

Addressing a press conference on behalf of the Joint Opposition, former External Affairs Minister Prof. G.L. Peiris said it the President who had the power to appoint Ministers and assign subjects to them.
He said that it was the President who transferred Mr. Karunanayake from the Finance Ministry to the Foreign Affairs Ministry.
This is something to do with the standards of credibility of his Foreign Affairs Minister. He is the interface between the Government and the international community, he said.
He said it was absurd for the Minister to deny any knowledge of his landlord and added that this could be regarded as an issue of trust.
Meanwhile, MP Udaya Gammanpila challenged the Government to bring in a No-Confidence Motion against Mr. Karunanayake considering the Parliamentarians as individual votes.
He said that the establishment of the Presidential Commission of Inquiry (PCoI) on the controversial Central Bank bond issue could be considered as an outcome of the struggle carried out by the Joint Opposition for two years in protest against the alleged scam. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)

Priority bus lanes in force in Colombo from August 15
	
Priority bus lanes will be in force in Colombo and its suburbs from August 15, officials from the Ministry of Megapolis and Western Development and the Police Traffic Division confirmed Today.
Officials said the programme will initially be implemented for traffic coming into Colombo along the Galle Road with other major roads and outbound traffic roped into equation in the coming months. If followed successfully the programme is set to reduce traffic congestion by at least 50 percent and allow a faster traffic flow within the city.
Transport Development Deputy Project Director from the Ministry of Megapolis and Western Development, P. Dissanayke said all bus routes in the city will be brought under the programme as and when infrastructure is available to do so.
We need at least three lanes in the road to establish such a programme. The issue now is that we dont have the necessary infrastructure. We will start with Galle Road and establish the programme in other areas when possible, he said.
Under the first phase of the programme, lanes will be allocated for buses along Galle Road, from Moratuwa to Pettah, and the route from Diyatha Uyana to Pettah.
A monitoring centre will be set up by the Ministry which will have access to CCTV cameras set up along the bus route. Buses will also be fixed with GPS trackers to ensure they do not travel outside the allocated lane.
The monitoring centre will be manned throughout the day and police officers will be present at the scene to direct officers in the field in case bus drivers do not travel along the allocated lane, Dissanayake said.
As the pilot project was already held, once initiated on August 15, the programme will function as part of traffic regulations and bus drivers will be liable to fines if they were to drive out of line.
We will deal with inbound traffic this year and out bound traffic next year. We have chosen Galle Road and road leading from Diyatha Uyana for the initial phase of the project. Under the second phase we will concentrate on Havelock Road, he said.
Officials conducted the pilot project for the programme from Rajagiriya Junction to Ayurveda Junction earlier this year.
Meanwhile, speaking to the Daily Mirror Director of Police Traffic Division in Colombo, SP Sumith Nissanka said the Police would provide their service to conduct this project as they did earlier when initiating it in Rajagiriya. (Nabeela Hussain and Kalathma Jayawardhane)

Sir John on  Dudleys Role  in 1962 Coup Conspiracy
	
Neville Js Hot summers evening at Kent, ends in aMidsummerNights DreamIt was on a hot summers evening in June 1974 that the extraordinary conversation I am about to narrate took place says, Neville Jayaweera (NJ), relating his meeting with the Prime Minister of 1953-56, Sir John Kotelawala at his Farm in Kent, England. NJ a senior CCS and the Former Chairman/Director General of SLBC, wrote in Ceylankan a magazine published in Down Under in early February 2013. [later republished in Sunday Island]

Two adverse ones among many responses for last weeks article on Dudley, and both accusing him of involvement in 1962 Coup, prompted me to clear the real Mr Clean of Sri Lankan politics of unjustifiable condemnations.
An assortment of rumours on Dudley Senanayakes alleged involvement in the botched coup attempt by a group of Police and Military officers in 1962 was a doing rounds during Sirimavo Bandaranaikes first [1960-64]rule. 
I say,! I know you think that Dudley was a man of great integrity. You know, there is no such thing as integrity in politics
NJs version and his concluding remarks are fascinating reading for anybody interested in politics behind Coup de tat 62. However the allegation of Dudleys involvement in the aborted attempt to topple Sirimavos regime, as related by Sir John, were based on flimsy grounds attributed to a statement by Felix Dias Bandaranaike in parliament on February 13, 1962, quoting hearsay from three junior suspects, two of whom were among the four crown witness in the trial-at Bar.
Felix himself never pursued the matter further. Three other leaders made only a few passing remarks subsequently in interviews in 1979 with JRJs biographers [all three were JRJ loyalists.] My endeavor here is to place facts exposing the schemers who fabricated the tale.
Its quite evident from the following quote, that Sir Johns narration is nothing, but balderdash springing from a disgruntled political haggard.
Dudleys initial role was to stand under the large clock of the General Post Office opposite Queens House, on the night of the coup, and light his pipe and Thattaya (meaning Sir Oliver) who was scheduled to stand watch on the balcony (of Queens House) around midnight, would take that as (a signal) the coup was on and declare aState of Emergency
the stories he related to me that evening, werent certainly malicious gossip nor did I think they were falsesays poor NJ, quoting the former
play boy PM.
NJs version and his concluding remarks are fascinating reading for anybody interested in politics behind Coup de tat 62
Dudleys first tenure as PM, at the invitation of Governor-General Lord Soulbury, following the tragic death of father DS, created turmoil within ruling party, with the majority of government parliamentarians, the cabinet and the UNP backing the 41-year old son over next in command and leader of the house Sir John. The PM was compelled to authorize the use of fire-power to quell the spread of Hartal violence resulting in nine deaths. These incidents upset the sensitive Dudley. Consequently in October 1953 he resigned as PM, handing over the reins to his cousin, Kotelawala. NJ says, I was so convinced that Sir John was telling it as it wasI urged my one time colleague Godfrey Gunatilleke of the Marga Institute, to have Sir Johns stories recorded on a tape for posterity. I believe that Gunatilleke sent one of the Marga staff, to Kandawela, Sir Johns home, to record his stories. Those priceless tapes, may still be languishing somewhere inMargas archives
The writer met Dr Godfrey Gunatilleke, Chairman emeritus, and Senior Advisor, Marga Institute who denied any knowledge of the above claim by his one time colleague NJ. In fact he says, one of Margas former Directors, a historian, advised him on another occasion that recordings of the versions of politicians on important events dont contribute anything worth restoration as they have no historical value unless scrutinized and verified. Quite an insightful opinion.
Quoting Sir John NJ says, I say,! I know you think that Dudley was a man of great integrity. You know, there is no such thing as integrity in politics. will you believe me when I say that Dudley and I were both ring leaders of the attempted coup of 1962  Here are the names of the buggers (sic) who met in my house on consecutive evenings in early January 1962 at Kandawala to plan the coup They shared all their plans with us three! In fact even Thattaya (Oliver) was in the know
NJ now convinced, confirms his earlier statement on Marga, I have placed an enormous trust in Dudley Senanayake as a model politician and Prime Minister and in fact, had given him my all within the call of duty: Sir Johnalso agreed even to speak into a tape recorder, provided it wont be made public except posthumously. Consequently, a few months later, when Sir John returned to Sri Lanka for his winter holiday that year, on my initiative the Marga Institute recorded his whole story on tape
during that holidayhe invited my family, for breakfasts at KandawelaThere again in the presence of several invitees hecomedy of how Dudley hid under his table-cloth, he kept everyone including foreign guests in stitchesNJ further comments, Sir Johns demonstrationadded flavour and credibility to the whole Dudley story
Dudley Senanayake, the Leader of the Opposition rose immediately after the Minister Felixs long speech on February 13 1962, denying any involvement in the coup and volunteered to face any inquiry as well. Even the worst critics of Dudley in the house, especially the Marxist leaders like Dr N M Perera, Dr Colvin R de Silva and P Keunamen disapproved the ministers suggestion. The trial judges rejected evidence incorporating the name of Dudley Senanayake by some accused as trash invented by coup leaders. At the trial no firm evidence surfaced in support of the theory, but the rumours continued to persist. Its surprising how Jayaweera who was in the Ceylon Civil Service at the time missed all this information and said, Its news to me
When the suspects were acquitted by the Privy Council in 1965, Dudley Senanayake was back in the saddle as Prime Minister; serving his third term with JRJ as second in command. However, strained relations between the two of them a year later made J R Jayewardene rush to Sir John at Kandawala on April 13, 1966 to place his grievances with the former party stalwart. Having nothing to lose and being out of politics, Sir John scrupulously dealt with the topic and spoke about the involvement of Dudley and himself in the planning of the abortive attempt. The truth is when the coup leaders met him for advice, Sir John suggested that they should involve Dudley and Sir Oliver; but to please JRJ and sling mud at his bete-noire, he would have stated that they held two final meetings at old Kitulwatte plumbago stores at Borella and also at his Kandawala house on the last two days Jan 25 & 26th 1962 chaired by Dudley. This he contradicts talking to NJ, when he asserted that both meetings were held at Kandawala and it was in early January. Then again on September 15, 1979 interviewed by the biographers of JR, he shifted the venue of both meetings to Plumbago Stores.
Sir John also related the story on January 11, 1968 to Esmond Wickremasinghe ( Lake House boss) [K M de Siva/Howard Wriggins-Leo Cooper-pge-118.], who insisted that he put it in writing of which document, the biographers say a copy is preserved at JRJ Centre; however the writers attempt to trace same with a very obliging staff at the centre was unsuccessful, though all documents including manuscripts on the subject are well preserved in file no. MMS 321. Sir John narrated the tale for the last time in September 1979 of course with many contradictions to JRJ biographers. There are so many conflicting and contradictory versions among the four; on each occasion Sir John told his audience that he is spilling the beans for the first time!
I say, Jayaweera! You know I have never spilled the beans to anyone like I have done to you, who the hell(sic) knew about Dudleys involvement in the attempted coup of 1962 NJs article
He said so in 1966, 68, 74 and again in 1979. [Ref-J R Jayewardene of Sri Lanka, Vol. II-pp114/116]
Its no secret that both Sir John and JRJ had an axe to grind with Dudley. In Sir Johns case it dates back to 1952 Premier Stakes episode- a slanderous political pamphlet, (Kele-Pattara) published in 1952 shortly after PM, D S Senanayakes death, unfolding the scheming that knocked-out Sir John from the ring with Dudley succeeding his father. It was well-known that Sir John hired a journalist to ghost write it. In that instance circumstances compelled the new PM Dudley to call for Kotelawalas resignation from the cabinet; however, the matter was amicably resolved. Later, in 1965 when Dudley became PM for the third time Sir John who had been eyeing the position of Governor-General returned to the island expecting the job. But Dudley didnt oblige and that hit the last nail in the coffin of their relationship.
de Saram went alone to Temple Trees and surrendered, confessing that he was alone responsible
Significantly, not one amongst the coup leaders breathed a word about either Dudleys or Sir Johns involvement although the authorities being suspicious of their connivance had made every effort to extract evidence and fabricate a case for prosecution.
NJ referring to the main suspect Col. F C de Saram says, de Saram went alone to Temple Trees and surrendered, confessing that he was alone responsible
De Saram who was connected to the Bandaranaikes through marriage to an Obeysekera, was a kinsman of SWRD. He was surprisingly asked to call at the PMs official residence by himself on Sunday morning, while the rest of the four leaders Sydney de Zoysa (ex- DIG), Maurice de Mel, Commander of the Volunteer Force and Jungle Dissanayake DIG [Royce was hiding] were arrested in their homes by the military on Saturday night itself and taken to Welikada directly.
F C de Saram the old Royalist, Barrister, Oxford Blue and former All Ceylon Cricket captain arrived at Temple Trees by 9.00 am to appear before the inquisition [Bradman Weerakoon,2004,-Rendering unto Caesar-pge 104] and never thought he would be arrested. Felix Dias Bandaranaike himself a lawyer belonged to the same Obeysekara/de Saram/Bandaranaike clan. PM Sirimavo was generous enough with FC; but FC de Sarams blueprint says to dispatch Felix to Army dungeon and Sirimavo to house arrest with her children when he becomes overall Commander of Forces on 28th morning.
The evidence in favor of the claim, that former PM, Dudley Senanayake was involved in the conspiracy are fragile, weak and insubstantial. Apart from Sir Johns unconvincing tales which are rather flimsy and malicious in nature, there were no other records available. Nor did they surface during the investigation, trial stage or even after the acquittal of all suspects. Apart from Sydney de Zoysas and Royce de Mels interview to JRJs biographers in September 1980 Zoysa, according to the biographers, had stated referring to Sir Johns stories, some of it was clearly at variance with truth. De Mel who first declined to talk, later mentioned about a meeting held at old plumbago stores in Borella that he attended with other coup leaders, where, he said, both Sir John and Dudley participated. He recalled a statement attributed to Dudley which said, the coup was the only way of giving strength to the constitution. And also he lamented that Dudley Senanayake gave the suspects no help during these dark days of imprisonment and trial like JR did, which justifies their anger.
Douglas Liyanage had made few comments, but in a lighter vein;[Ref.JRJ of Sri Lanka vol II-]. But these are all unsubstantial, fragile and partial. If one has to accept the word of learned authors here, who admit that none of the other coup leaders they met ever spoke on the matter but Royce de Mel, the former Navy Commander, who lost his job following a Far Eastern cruise and Douglas Liyanage CCS. One was made GM of the Hotels Corporation and the other Permanent Secretary to the Ministry of State by none other than JRJ. According to his biographers JR had warned Sydney de Zoysa, when he tried to sound out JRs views on the plan. JR had sent him packing with; Sydney, I hear some of your people are planning dont do it. But biographers didnt comment on why JR fail to act, if he felt that a conspiracy was being hatched.
The long standing enmity between the above three families, which formed the upper layer of the UNP hierarchy, and politics of the island for over half a century, could be attributed to Mudliyar D C G Attygalles enormous fortune, plantations and islands best plumbago mines. Each of his three daughters was given in marriage with dowries of thousands of acres. Ellen married F R Senanayake (Dudley uncle), Alice with 2,058 acres to John Kotalawala. Snr. (Sir Johns father), and Lena with 2,961 acres to T G Jayewardene (JRs uncle). Kotalawala Snr, received 1000 acres less than Senanayake and Jayewardene.
He said, both Sir John and Dudley participated. He recalled a statement attributed to Dudley which said, the coup was the only way of giving strength to the constitution
The enmity started with the murder of Francis Attygalle, the only brother of Alice, Ellen and Lena and heir apparent to the remaining wealth that included all the mines; further he was managing the properties as well. After he was murdered the family fortunes went to his sisters.-Kumari Jayewardene-2007; Nobodies to Somebodies-, pp:194/288
The Senanayakes took a great effort to bring the murder culprits to book, which finally ended with John Kotalawala Snr. (Sir Johns father) being arrested for allegedly planning of the murder of his brother-in-law. The beginning of the enmity. Kotalawala Snr. committed suicide in jail during the trial. Close connections of Senanayakes, Kotalawalas and Jayewardenes through inter-marriages contributed to unfortunate dilemma of their politics and personal relations that lasted for generations. [Coomaraswamy, 1988]
C C Dissanayake DIG [the 2nd suspect and Ravi Karunanayakes grandfather] had told one of his subordinatesthat a large organization was behind the move to overthrow the government, that certain political leaders were in the know of it, and that persons even higher than that were in itA police officer whose statement was recorded had said that he had been told by one of the leaders of the coup that Sir John Kotalawala and Mr Dudley Senanayake were in the know of the plan to overthrow the government.Felix Dias B. in the House-(White Paper-1962)
Coup leaders used Dudley Senanayake as their bait; either explicitly or implicitly to convince the reluctant second level officers who they believed wouldnt consent to a coup as something alien to established traditions in local politics. The government understood reality and put an end to the line of investigation after Felixs initial statement. Dudleys own party men grabbed the opportunity to whack the Senanayake clan to satisfy their deep-rooted animosities. Sir Johns amusing demonstration and vocabulary in the presence of his guests of how Dudley hid under the table cloth as told by Neville Jayaweera was in poor taste.
Considering that Dudley was a public figure and should be subject to public scrutiny, I confess that keeping the story secret was wrong! Hence this narrative!NJ. He ends the story not discussing some of what was said with the explanation The latter stories were trivia and gossip with no historical or national relevance. This may well apply to those parts of the `yarn that brought Dudley into the coup.
Mid-summer nights Dream or a Comedy of Errors He lived a life of gross materiality and sensuality Deep and unspeakable lonelinessShorn of all the pomp and the adulation that surrounded him when he was center stage, he seemed to dread living on the edge of oblivionon Sir John Kotalawala- there, NJ ends.
It was the philosopher, Jean-Jacques Rousseau (18th C.), who said, Insults are the arguments employed by those who are in the wrong.

SL among countries with highest breastfeeding rates
	
Sri Lanka had been ranked among the 23 countries that have achieved exclusive breastfeeding rates, a scorecard released by the World Health Organization and the UNICEF at the start of the World Breastfeeding Week said.
The World Breastfeeding Week is celebrated every year from August 1 to 7 to encourage breastfeeding and improve the health of babies around the world.

According to the Scorecard, which evaluate 194 nations, found that only 40 per cent of children younger than six months are breastfed exclusively (given nothing but breast milk) and only 23 countries have exclusive breastfeeding rates above 60 per cent.
The scorecard was released at the start of World Breastfeeding Week alongside a new analysis demonstrating that an annual investment of only US$4.70 per newborn is required to increase the global rate of exclusive breastfeeding among children under six months, to 50 per cent by 2025.
The scorecard compiles data from countries all over the world on the status of seven priorities set by the Global Breastfeeding Collective to increase the rate of breastfeeding.
Breastfeeding is a vital part of providing every child with the healthiest start to life. It is a babys first vaccine and the best source of nutrition. It can bolster brain development. It can save 520,000 childrens lives in the next 10 years, the scorecard said.

Tribute to a loving  daughter
	
I feel greatly privileged to pay tribute to the memory of our beloved cousin, late Maruneekiar Thiruvathavoorar, affectionately called Manie acca, at her Anthietty Ceremony this morning. She passed away on June 10, 2017 having led a life of grace and dignity. This lovely lady who had touched our lives in some way or other either as family, friend, colleague or a beloved teacher leaving loving memories of her in our hearts. 
She was born on March 17, 1926 as the third child of Kathiravelu Sadayer Arulnandhy and Sakunthalaiamma. 
Her name was a somewhat difficult name for non-speakers of Tamil. When her father took her to be admitted to Methodist College Colombo, the Principal Mrs. Loos had asked her father, I am sure you have another name for her at home, and her father had said, Yes indeed, we call her Manie, and so she was entered in the class register as Manie Arulnandhy, and was generally known as Manie thereafter.
Manie acca attended several schools as the family accompanied the father to his various postings until he ended up as a Deputy Director of Education. Thus she studied at Chundukuli Girls College, Jaffna, Kandy Girls High School, Sacred Heart Convent, Galle, Methodist College, Colombo and Hartley College, Point Pedro. She, her sister Kamalasany and Amy Thamotharam were the first of the very few girls ever admitted to Hartley College. 
She was deeply religious but was ecumenical in perception and always accommodated all religions, as one. I have never known her to have failed in her duties; whatever she did for her family, friends, colleagues, whether they were in the right or wrong, it was always with the best intentions.
She had a brilliant secondary school career; at the Senior Cambridge Examination she came 2nd in the Island. She proceeded to Annamalai University in South India to do her degree. She read physics and pure mathematics and she obtained a second class Bachelor of Science Degree. In 1955 she obtained the Diploma in Education from the University of Colombo. 
In 1952, she married Thambipillai Thiruvatharoorar, a fellow student at Annamalai University. I once heard her husband say that without Manie acca he could not live any more. 
She was deeply religious but was ecumenical in perception and always accommodated all religions, as one. I have never known her to have failed in her duties; whatever she did for her family, friends, colleagues, whether they were in the right or wrong, it was always with the best intentions. Her word was her honour and her promises were her bond. In short, as a woman she was endowed with a warm, genial, benevolent and magnanimous disposition. Her compassion and kindness knew no bounds. She was completely free of pettiness in her attitude to others. These were the sterling qualities which endeared her to all those who had the good fortune to know her. 
Having known her personally for more than five decades, what overwhelms me are her humanism and her simplicity. Indeed it was my privilege to be associated with Manie acca for more than fifty years. Many will miss her, and many more will mourn her demise. 
She is worthy of remembrance for generations to come. 
May her soul rest in peace! 
A. Gnanathasan,
Presidents Counsel

Trump signs Russia sanctions bill into law: White House
	

U.S. President Donald Trump has signed legislation imposing new sanctions on Russia into law, a White House official said on Wednesday.
The U.S. Congress voted last week by overwhelming margins for sanctions to punish the Russian government over interference in the 2016 presidential election, annexation of Ukraines Crimea and other perceived violations of international norms.
Trump, who has made clear he wanted to improve relations with Russia, grudgingly accepted the new congressional sanctions, which also included Iran and North Korea. The bill had enough support in Congress to override a presidential veto.
Trumps signing of the bill followed some conflicting signals from the administration in recent days about the sanctions.
U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson told reporters on Tuesday that he and Trump did not believe the new sanctions would be helpful to our efforts on diplomacy with Russia. Vice President Mike Pence said that the bill showed Trump and Congress were speaking with a unified voice.
White House adviser Kellyanne Conway confirmed the signing during an interview with Fox News.
Trumps desire for better relations with Moscow has been hamstrung by findings of U.S. intelligence agencies that Russia interfered to help the Republican against Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. U.S. congressional panels and a special counsel are investigating. Moscow denies any meddling and Trump denies any collusion by his campaign.
The Russian rouble weakened slightly following the initial report that Trump had signed the bill.

Undated letter was an oversight: Ravi
	
Minister Ravi Karunanayake said that the undated letter, sent to the then Central Bank Governor Arjuna Mahendran was completely an oversight. He said that he had not indicated the date and the reference due to an oversight.
When Additional Solicitor General wanted to know the reason as to the origin of such a letter the Minister explained the situation he had as the Finance Minister in the beginning of the 2015.
He said that there was an unaccounted debt in balance and an outstanding repayment amounting Rs. 100 billion, when they assumed duties as the new Government in 2015.
The witness said there was a meeting on February 26, 2015 with Mr. Malik Samarawickrama and Kabir Hashim over the fund requirement of Rs. 75 billion for road development projects.
The meeting was held prior to the controversial bond auction that took place on February 27, 2015.
When questioned he confirmed that there was no sudden need to raise money in February but the funds were required for the payments in RDA projects.
The witness said Mr. Mahendran requested him to send a letter relating to what happened at the February 26, 2015 meeting between the three ministers and thereby he had sent the letter in May 2016.
This letter contained the idea that it was decided at the meeting on the fund requirement of the Government for Rs 75 billion.
The ASG questioned the witness as to why there was no date or reference in the letter. The witness said it was an oversight.
Then the ASG asked whether there was a copy or corresponding Ministrys file relating to the letter. The witness said he forwarded the letter in response to a request made by Mr. Mahendran.
The ASG repeatedly questioned him as to why he had not mentioned the person who requested the letter.
The ASG was of the view that this letter was created very recently because when it was produced before the PCoI, the letter was apparently new and crisp.
However, the witness denied the ASGs stance and maintained what he said.
When the ASG was attempting to question further as to how the letter originated, the Commission said it was a waste of time because the witness has already made his stance before the Commission.
However, there was a heated argument thereafter between the Commission and the ASG over the relevancy of further questioning on the matter. (Shehan Chamika Silva)
