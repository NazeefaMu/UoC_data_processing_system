A birthday party that went sour
	

It was the birthday of a provincial bigwig and his staff chief organized a surprise reception to the boss to mark the event.

He got the big mans office decorated with balloons and streamers, had the special birthday cake delivered on time and made sure that everything was in perfect order. And they were all eagerly awaiting the arrival of the boss.
The bigwig arrived and walked into his office without the slightest hint of what was to be expect inside. The staff chief and a few other white-collar high-ups followed him.
The reaction of the bigwig was something they never expected. Looking around with visible annoyance, he angrily barked at his staff chief. I say, what is this nonsense I am not a small child to play with balloons. Tear off all these decorations immediately!
A few loyal subordinates later gathered around the highly dejected staff chief to commiserate with him.
See men, what I got in return for a good thing I had done! he told his sympathizers.
Well, Sir, you asked for it and got it bellyful! one of them quipped.

China  wont give up an inch of territory: Xi
	

Beijing, (Hindustan Times), June 28, 2018 - China is committed to peace and will never pursue expansionism but will not give up an inch of territory, President Xi Jinping told visiting US defence secretary James Mattis at a meeting in Beijing on Wednesday.
Mattis is in Beijing as tension between the two countries mount over a looming trade war and Chinas assertive claims on territorial rights in the dispute-ridden South China sea. Our stance is steadfast and clear-cut when it comes to Chinas sovereignty and territorial integrity, Xi was quoted as saying by the official news agency, Xinhua, adding that any inch of territory passed down from ancestors cannot be lost while we want nothing from others.
What is other peoples, we do not want at all, Xi said.
Mattis told Xi that the US attaches great importance to relations between the two countries and the two militaries, and military ties play a vital role in the bilateral relations.

Curing with care
	

All human beings at a certain point in their lives have experienced a disease affecting them or their loved ones. Be it in the form of your run-of-the-mill cold to more complex incurable terminal afflictions like cancer, the common ground that all these ailments share is pain and suffering.
Although pain can be resolved for the most part by adequate pain killers or analgesia the aspect of suffering and how it affects an individual is rarely addressed.
This is where Palliative Care plays an integral role in the modern health care setup. Palliative Care as defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) is an approach that improves the quality of life of patients and their families facing the problems associated with life-threatening illness, through the prevention and relief of suffering by means of early identification and assessment and treatment of pain and other problems which are physical, psychosocial and spiritual. It is estimated roughly that over 40 million incurably ill and dying people require Palliative Care annually. And a vast majority does not have access to the facilities they desperately require. 
The modern concept of Palliative Care was first introduced by a British Anglican physician named Dame Cecily Saunders, who emphasised the importance of Palliative Care in modern medicine. She also played an integral role in establishing the first contemporary hospice in 1967 which was St.
Christophers Hospice in South London. The word palliative is derived from the Latin word palliare which means to cloak. Palliative care is usually provided by Palliative Care specialists  health care professionals who have received specialized training or are certified in providing palliative care. This field requires a multidisciplinary team-which comprises of doctors, nurses, physiotherapists, psychological counselors, certified dieticians, alternative medical therapists (e.g. acupuncturist) caregivers, priests and social workers-in order to make it effective. The objective of this team is to improve the overall Quality of Life of the patient. All human beings are endowed with the need to communicate- to talk, be listened to and to feel relevant-and patients treated through Palliative Care are no different. Some individuals who receive a terminal diagnosis tend to find solace in their religious or spiritual believes whilst others tend to question their beliefs and ask why they are in this current predicament. When bad news is broken to a patient the emotional changes the affected individual and caregivers endure cannot be summed up in words, but it affects all, in a detrimental manner. The patient may feel the need to isolate themselves from society due to the stigmatizing effect of the disease or due to loss of their jobs/social status following the diagnosis of the affliction. Therefore, engaging in active listening and participating in empathic conversations-involving patient and caregiver alike-plays a pivotal role in changing the mindset of an individual. Altering the sufferers outlook to a more positive one almost has a therapeutic effect on them, even alleviating their pain. 

The modern concept of Palliative Care was first introduced by a British Anglican physician named Dame Cecily Saunders, who emphasised the importance of Palliative Care in modern medicine

Pain management also plays an important role in the process of Palliative Care. Dame Cecily Saunders promulgated that the Total Pain endured by an individual includes various aspects such as physical, psychological, spiritual and social. Alleviation of pain successfully is, therefore a holistic process whereby all these aspects must be addressed according to her. The International Association for Study of Pain defines pain as An unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage. For all practical purposes though pain is when a person says it hurts since it is a subjective phenomenon. Depending on the duration of pain it is customarily classified into acute and chronic; whereas an Acute Pain is defined as a pain lasting less than three 3 months duration a Chronic Pain exceeds 3 months. But its concerning the latter form of pain that Palliative Care is primarily concerned with. Chronic Pain is one of the most significant causes of prolonged suffering and disability worldwide concerning both communicable (e.g. HIV/AIDS) and non-communicable diseases (e.g. cancer and diabetes mellitus) Whilst Acute Pain serves a biological function by decreasing potential damage to the body, Chronic Pain is not known to serve such a purpose. It differs vastly from Acute Pain in terms of presentation as well; with symptoms ranging from sleep disturbance, mood changes and restriction of social activities.
Many patients enduring insufficient pain relief may seek more expensive alternative modes and this may also cause a major financial burden to the family or caregiver of the patient. The management of Pain in the hospital setup is done according to the WHO analgesic ladder usually in a step-wise manner. The first step of the ladder comprises of non-opioid analgesics such as aspirin, paracetamol and Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory drug (NSAIDS) such as diclofenac sodium. Step 2 and 3 mainly includes the addition of opioid analgesics to step 1 (weak opioids such as codeine/tramadol in step 2 and strong opioids like morphine in step 3). Broadly speaking opioids are a group of drugs that act on the central nervous system to relieve pain. But abuse of them can lead to withdrawal and physical dependence.  When one observes the current trend of Disease Burden across the world it is abundantly obvious that there has been a sharp increase in both communicable and non-communicable diseases. The role that Palliative Care plays in both is an integral one. As such the need to address this need and integrating Palliative Care to the health care systems the world over is both a timely and important one.

Dictators Others and Ours
	
Why Sri Lanka is in a tight spot over a strong leader


Many people reject only the dictatorship of others and not of those they support
In a country where oppression of others views had been the norm, a wider democratic space is deemed to be an indication of weakness of the establishment

Northern Tamil votes would also have to be counted against the SLPP at a Presidential election


The advice was given by Ven. Vendaruwe Upali Thera, the Anunayaka of the Asgiriya Chapter to former Defence Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa to become a Hitler, in order to build the country, would not have become so controversial and a widely read topic in newspapers, if there werent a debate over the latters possible candidacy at the next Presidential Election.
The Ven. Thera had reportedly requested the former Defence Secretary to even resort to become a Hitler and run a military rule and build the country.
He said this at the religious ceremony and almsgiving held on the 69th birthday of Gotabhaya Rajapaksa at his residence in Mirihana. However, in fairness to the Ven. Thera it is worth mentioning that he had made this statement in response to the allegations purported to have been made by the opponents of Mr Rajapaksa.
If they call you a Hitler, then become a Hitler, even establish a military rule and build the country, the Thera had reportedly said. The statement since had drawn flak from many quarters including the highest offices in the country.
President Maithripala Sirisena said as a Buddhist he had the highest respect for the clergy, but could not agree with the senior monk of the Asgiriya chapter. Meanwhile, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe also had stated in a public meeting there was no way Buddhism and Hitlers brutality can be reconciled. Buddhists cannot tell someone to be like Idi Amin or Hitler or Pol-Pot, it goes against the Buddhas teachings he had stated.

Therefore the 20th Amendment to the Constitution Bill presented by Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) as a Private Members Bill recently seems to be a godsend to the SLPP and especially to Mahinda Rajapaksa

Dr Dayan Jayatilleka, who is vehement in his opposition to Gotabaya Rajapaksas manifest aspirations to become President of the country in spite of him being an ardent supporter of Gotabayas brother, former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, also had negatively commented on the Theras remarks in one of his newspaper columns. Even the Ambassador of Hitlers country, Germany, Jorn Rohde had called the Theras remarks outrageous.
Gotabaya Rajapaksa being called as a dictator or a tough administrator is not without reasons. Whether he had any direct links or not, it was during his tenure as the Defence Secretary, the security forces had been accused of so many highhanded acts.
Killing demonstrators at Katunayake, Chilaw and Rathupaswala, attacks on journalists Lasantha Wikramatunga, Keith Noyahr, Upali Thennakoon and Poddala Jayantha, abduction of Kumar Gunarathnam and Welikada prison massacre were emblematic among them.
The main reason for the alarm behind these criticisms against the Theras remarks is not that many of these critics are pure democrats. Some of the critics had been either members or the defenders of a Government that abolished the Independent Commissions, which had some checks over highhandedness of the Executive Presidency, while some others had been either members or supporters of Governments during which dead bodies were strewn along the roads and floated in rivers and lagoons. Thus, many people reject only the dictatorship of others and not of those they support
As mentioned above, the alarm over the Theras remarks has been caused purely due to the current debate over Gotabaya Rajapaksas apparent plan to contest at the next Presidential Election.
Gotabaya- while claiming that he would consider contesting at the next Presidential Election only if he has the blessings of his brother and former President- has been in recent months building a political image for him through his Eliya (Light) Organization and Viyath Maga (Scholarly Path) programmes. If he has no political ambitions there is no logic behind these efforts.
However, despite the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP), the newly declared party unofficially led by Mahinda Rajapaksa, winning the majority of Local Councils at the February 10 LG elections, prospects of Gotabaya or any other leader of Mahinda Rajapaksa camp at the next Presidential Election is not so bright, mainly due to the whole country turning into a single electorate at such an election.
There can be distortions of proportionality of votes obtained by various political parties at all other elections, but not at a Presidential Election.
For instance, the SLPP which had obtained 4.9 million votes at the February 10 elections had won more than 230 out of 340 Local Councils, whereas the United National Party (UNP) while bagging 3.6 million votes from around the country had the majority power in just 41 councils.
Proportionally, the UNP should have been in power at least in 170 councils. Though the total number of councils won by the parties in the Government was about fifty the votes received collectively by them exceeded the votes of the SLPP.
Northern Tamil votes would also have to be counted against the SLPP at a Presidential election.
Therefore, winning all communities is very vital for any party to win a Presidential Election. For reasons real as well as perceived, Gotabaya Rajapaksa would be the last person in the Rajapaksa camp to do so.
Minorities do not seem to have changed their mind with regard to Gotabaya. On the other hand, he is not an undisputed candidate even within the Rajapaksa camp.
However, the anti-SLPP camp must have a common Presidential candidate if they are to defeat Gotabaya or any SLPP candidate, as they did in 2014, which is a remote possibility in the light of current political alignments.
Therefore, the SLPP might come first but not get the legally required 50 per cent of votes, which would necessitate the counting of second preference, for the first time in the history.
Nevertheless, the prospects for the SLPP would be far better at a General Election, if held prior to the Presidential Election.
If the Mahinda camp was able to win around 90 seats at the 2015 August Parliamentary Election despite its unexpected and humiliating defeat at the Presidential Election seven months ago, with the morale boost gained at the recent Local Government elections they might turn the tables and would at least be able to come first, if not winning the election.
And if his group managed to win 113 seats in the Parliament, Mahinda Rajapaksa knows how to muster the support of another 37 or 38 MPs to take over the Presidential mantle after bringing in the provisions of the 18th Amendment to the Constitution again.
Yet, the 19th Amendment to the Constitution does not in any way allow the Elections Commission to hold the next Parliamentary Election before the Presidential Election.
Also, only an insane person can expect Parliament dissolving itself passing a resolution, to go for a mid-term election.
Therefore the 20th Amendment to the Constitution Bill presented by Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) as a Private Members Bill recently seems to be a godsend to the SLPP and especially to Mahinda Rajapaksa.
But Rajapaksa and his loyalists have not realised it. Besides, Mahinda Rajapaksa is an undisputed leader and a candidate within his group, for any high office.
Ven. Upali Thera had later clarified his remarks on the former Defence Secretary. He had said what he meant was that the country needed a strong leader with a firm resolve.
Despite the question remaining as to how many people might have accepted his clarification, nobody can contest the fact that country needs a strong leader with a firm resolve.
In a country where oppression of others views had been the norm, a wider democratic space is deemed to be an indication of weakness of the establishment, as the case has been today.
The University students unions and the GMOA that meekly submitted, when President Rajapaksa provided loans and scholarships to SAITM, created a hell over the same issue under this Government.
Also, in a country where everything including religion is politicized, with people being prepared to ruin their own future in the name of politics, people would oppose every act and project progressive or destructive finding holes in them.
Hence, some sort of bulldozing is justifiable.
Marxists do not hesitate to call the mechanism that implements socialism a proletarian dictatorship. Mahathir Mohamed or Lee Kwan Yew did not build their countries with leniency. Yet, in a society corrupt to the core with even the anti-corruption drives being corrupt, those bulldozing powers without proper checks and balances would lead to producing Hitlers.
That is the tight spot Sri Lanka is in.

DM Astro 46 - Sun in Astrology  Part 2

A fall Sun, an ideal position for political success

According to Astrological principles, a debilitated Sun confers humility. Therefore, it becomes a great asset to ordinary persons, politicians in a democracy, but detrimental to kings and rulers.
In fact, some great men in history have been born with a debilitated Sun. The first Prime Minister of India Shri Jawaharlal Nehru was one of the world leaders who had been born with a debilitated Sun. Among the Sri Lankan leaders who had a fall Sun at birth are the former Prime Ministers D.S. Senanayake, Wijayananda Dahanayake, the first Sri Lankan governor Sir Oliver Goonetillake, former Ambassadors Sir Senarath Gunawardena and Gunapala Malalasekera. Humility is an essential quality for a politician or a statesman. A debilitated Sun confers that quality.

Sun with other planets
The Sun produces good results when he is posited in his sign Leo. He gives good results for Aries as the lord of the 5th trine and for Sagittarius as the lord of the 9th trine.
The Sun is strong in the 3rd House and confers good health, integrity of character, and courage. But he is bad for younger brothers of the native except when the 3rd House falls in the Leo sign.
The Sun is favourable in the 6th as the lord of 6th, for Pisces and in the 8th as the lord of 8th for Capricorn. The Sun produces very good results in the 10th where he commands Digbala, provided he is not the lord of the 6th, 8th or the 12th. The Sun produces excellent results in the 11th for the Sagittarius ascendant as the lord of the 9th House.
The Sun is normally good for the 11th House unless it happens to be the Badhakasthana for a movable ascendant.
A strong Sun in the 10th or the 11th is as auspicious as a good Jupiter in the 4th. The Sun exalted in the 7th Aries and as the lord of 11th produces for the Libra ascendant Kalatrasaubhagya or a happy wedded life.
The Sun, in the 2nd Bhava of Leo as the lord of the 2nd for Cancer ascendant and in Aries for Pisces Ascendant, produces Dhanayoga.
For the Sagittarius ascendant SunMercury combination (as the lords of the 7th, 10th and 11th Houses) produces Rajayoga. Mercury in Gemini or Virgo with the Sun even in combustion produces Rajayoga.
The Sun, the royal planet and Jupiter, the divine planet together produce a very favourable combination. This combination confers on the native sincerity, devotion to duty, political patronage, and immense wealth.
Sun-Moon combination produces Kuhoo Yoga. However, this Yoga would not produce good results unless the combination is in the 3rd or the 11th House either with Jupiter or Venus or aspected by one of them.
Sun-Mars combination in the 10th despite both commanding Digbala is unfavourable. The reason is that both Mars and Sun are fiery planets and their combination makes the native rash, impulsive, and hot-tempered. Besides, the combination gives a hot constitution that causes diseases like hemorrhoids.
The Sun and Mars in the 10th make the native arrogant and dictatorial thus he becomes an object of hate of his subordinates.
Sun-Mars-Jupiter combination in the 10th is very favourable. This combination confers position of authority or high office, wealth, pleasing and candid speech, and uprightness.
Sun-Saturn combination or opposition is not favourable for holding high office in the government. It also signifies friction with father.
Sun-Saturn-Moon combination is very unfavourable unless it receives the beneficial aspect of a strong Jupiter.
Sun-Rahu combination is not good especially if Rahu is very close to the Sun.
The Sun in the 12th if in Taurus, Aquarius or Cancer aggravates diseases and may even cause death.
The Sun and the Moon in opposition or in conjunction with, cause accidents if they are aspected by Mars.

Erdogans victory: Regaining  Turkeys Ottoman power and heritage
	
A 2018 political phenomenon: First it was Xi Jinping, then Vladimir Putin and now Recep Tayyip Erdogan. It appears that they are all here to stay in politics for a long time. According to some development theorists, virtual one-party rule with popular support is good for growth as it ensures policy stability, provided the leaders have a vision.
Lee Kuan Yew governed Singapore for more than 30 years and Robert Mugabe ruled Zimbabwe for nearly four decades. Singapore under the visionary leadership of Lee rose from a basket case to a model to be emulated by other countries to reach high levels of development, while Mugabes Zimbabwe rapidly went down a sinkhole, though he too had a vision. Zimbabwes downfall was largely due to corruption, an imprudent foreign policy that courted the hostility of the west and western sanctions on the country.

Critics believe the Nationalist Party can act as a check against Erdogan

If Lee and Mugabe are on the two extremes of a virtual one-party spectrum, Turkeys Erdogan who won last Sundays presidential election falls in between. No doubt, like Lee, Mugabe, Chinese President Xi and Russian President Putin, Erdogan is a democratic dictator. But whether he can turn Turkey into a world power is the question that looms large after his landmark victory.
Erdogan, who has been in power since 2003, is now the all-powerful executive president, the countrys first.
The victory at Sundays presidential poll, held under a state of emergency, enables him to pick the vice presidents, head the state and government, command the armed forces and appoint ministers, high-level officials and senior judges. The powers vested in the presidency  which the Turkish people narrowly approved in a referendum last year  have seriously undermined the checks and balances required to prevent a democracy from turning into a dictatorship. The new constitutional reforms approved last year have done away with the office of the prime minister. Parliament is largely a rubber stamp of presidential decrees. The President can dissolve parliament, issue executive decrees and declare astate of emergency.

The President can dissolve parliament, issue executive decrees and declare astate of emergency

But the election results show that the people had voted intelligently. Yes, Erdogan, a professional soccer player and Marmara University business administration graduate who once sold lemonade and sesame bread at traffic lights, is popular enough to be reelected, but the people apparently had felt that he needed to be checked. So they did not give his party a majority in parliament. Although he won the presidential election with 53 percent of the votes in the first round itself, his AK Party (Justice and Development Party) suffered a 7 percent dent in parliamentary polls held simultaneously. The party won only 43 percent of the votes, securing 295 seats. However, the far-right Nationalist Movement Party (MHP) has agreed to extend support and the two parties add up to 343 seats in the 600-member assembly  yet 20 short of the 363 seat mark required to give legal effect to last years referendum. Critics believe the Nationalist Party can act as a check against Erdogan.
The results also show that Turkey is politically divided down the middle  with one half endorsing Erdogan and the other half opposing him. In another blow to Erdogan, the Kurdish political party, HDP, whose leader has been jailed, crossed the ten percent cutoff point to win 67 parliamentary seats.
Under his 15-year-rule, the countrys economy grew significantly. Critics say this was because he happened to be in office at the right time when the coordinates necessary for economic growth were in place. The US invasion of Iraq in 2003, the year in which Erdogan was ensconced as prime minister, made Turkey a key supplier nation. Turkey won a large number of contracts to rebuild war-ravaged Iraqs infrastructure. In 2017, when Saudi Arabia broke ties with Qatar and imposed an economic blockade on the tiny but rich Gulf nation, Turkey stepped in to ensure that Qatar did not suffer food shortages, thereby further straining ties with Saudi Arabia and Egypt. Turkey and Qatar were supporters of Egypts post-Arab Spring Brotherhood government, which the Saudis together with US support subsequently ousted. Turkey economy has been growing at a remarkable of 7.5 percent since Erdogan took office, though its currency, lira, has suffered a 20 percent depreciation while inflation has reached double digits and the current account runs a deficit in what is seen as a major imbalance in the economy.If all systems go, the 64-year-old Erdogan will be the president till 2028, provided he wins the second term in five years time.

But the botched military coup on July 15, 2016 became a game changer

His reelection is crucial for the stability of the Middle Eastern region. At a time when key Middle Eastern nations have muted their support for the Palestinians in deference to US President Donald Trumps wishes and in view of their growing secret ties with Israel due to their antagonism with Iran, Erdogan has emerged as a champion of Palestinian rights. Many Muslims believe that he can fill the leadership vacuum in the Muslim world.
Turkey is a key player in the Syrian war, too. Initially, it supported the Saudi-Qatar moves to oust Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Turkey, which became a generous host to millions of Syrian refugees, turned a blind eye when jihadists from all over the world used the country as a transit base before they crossed into Syria. Many joined the ISIS and other extremist groups.
By shooting down a Russian fighter jet in November 2015, Erdogan displayed courage to take on Putins mighty Russia, which had militarily intervened in the Syrian conflict to prop up the
Assad regime.
But the botched military coup on July 15, 2016 became a game changer. Erdogan was livid that the United States, whom he supported in the Syrian war, had doubled crossed him and had a hand in the military coup. The US has denied the charge. In a surprise turnaround, Erdogan visited Russia and agreed to work with Moscow in finding a solution to the Syrian conflict.
While Erdogan courted Russias friendship, the US established strategic ties with the Syrian Kurds, whom Erdogans Turkey has branded terrorists for their close links with Kurdish separatists in Turkey. This further strained Ankaras ties with Washington and other western nations. The West has accused Erdogan of undermining democratic principles. Scores of journalists are in jail for criticising Erdogan while tens of thousands of public servants are in detention for being members of a banned Islamic religious group led by Fethullah Gulen, a self-exiled scholar living in Pennsylvania. Erdogan has accused the Gulen movement of engineering the 2016 coup, a charge the group has denied.
Erdogan has scoffed at Western criticism. He no longer expresses desire to seek the oft-rejected European Union membership. On the contrary, his government is courting China for investments and trade.
Erdogan, an Islamist in secular Turkey, is now a virtual sultan -- an Ottoman caliph sans its vast empire. His ambition is for Turkey to reclaim its Ottoman heritage at least by 2023, the centenary of the founding of modern Turkey by Mustafa Kemal Ataturk. But the question is: can he achieve his dream, overcoming many economic and international hurdles

France brings back national service for all 16-year-olds
	

France, (Daily Mail), 28 June 2018 - France is bringing back compulsory national service for 16-year-olds, fulfilling one of President Emmanuel Macrons campaign pledges.
Conscripts will be made to serve for one month, with a focus on civic service as well as military training, and the option of extending the placement of up to a year.
Military conscript service was scrapped in 1996, leaving Macron the first ever French President not to have been drafted. During his presidential campaign, Macron promised to make all young people spend a month getting a direct experience of military life with its know-how and demands.
He billed it as a way to build social cohesion and patriotism in a country battling deep divisions, by bringing young people from different backgrounds together in barracks.

## Title: Gastritis could be cured

Gastritis could be cured
	

Skipping a meal or two has become common practice today. While we feel uncomfortable during a major hunger pang, we usually ignore it or delay meals depending on our schedules. Meals and water are essential to keep your system fueled for the day and skipping these would lead to conditions such as gastritis. A person may develop gastritis due to various reasons like for example not having meals on time. The fasting period, which just ended is a month where many people following the Islamic faith refrain from taking meals and water from 11-16 hours. 
Speaking to the Daily Mirror, gastrointestinal surgeon Dr. Ranil Jayasena shared his views on why fasting is not healthy and the various reasons for people to develop gastritis.

Is fasting healthy
Fasting is not good anyway because when there is not much water in the body, all the systems get dried up, said Dr. Jayasena. This could worsen existing diseases. When you fast there is nothing in the stomach and there is a continuous secretion of hydrochloric acid and enzymes to the stomach. Usually with the water we drink it gets diluted and when there are hunger contractions which happen basically thrice a day they get more and more intense and the secretion of hydrochloric acid and enzymes also increase. This is why you feel hungry and you have to eat and drink something. You become thirsty when the water content in the blood is less. A person may develop gastritis due to the disruption of the integrity of the wall of the stomach (gastric mucosa). This could be due to an H. Piroli infection, excessive intake of medicine for diabetes, backaches, smoking or consuming alcohol. The mucosa is very vulnerable to even small amounts of hydrochloric acid. When you fast you pave the way for these problems. Therefore we dont recommend fasting even for religious reasons and certain patients do oblige. But after the fasting season the number of patients with gastritis is usually high,the doctor said.

The younger generation is addicted to coffee, barbecue or particular fizzy drinks. This is bad because they all can cause cancer. If you consume the same food for a long time, any food will become carcinogenic. Therefore the younger people should be advised about it

Do not skip meals
In a country like this, sometimes people cannot afford to have three meals a day, Dr. Jayasena continued. Three meals a day is a must. If you skip a meal you make your system vulnerable to conditions such as gastritis. If you dont drink enough water you will end up with kidney problems. Cells need water to be hydrated and function smoothly; therefore an adult has to drink at least two and a half litres of water throughout the day. When you work in an air-conditioned room you dont feel thirsty. This is because evaporation and perspiration is less and this in turn retains the water content in your blood. But it is not so for the bowel. It needs water throughout the day and therefore we advise these people to drink water by force to make sure that the bowel action happens smoothly. This could lead up to constipation. When you skip meals there will be no faeces in the bowel which will make it shrink and get irritated leading up to spasms. This is called Irritable Bowel Syndrome. Then the coordination between the bowel and the nervous system will break down and the patient will get psychologically affected,Dr. Jayasena explained.

Say NO to spices
Dr. Jayasena further said that when patients suffer from gastritis they should avoid eating high contents of chilli and pepper. Depending on the severity of the diseases we advise them whether to have spices or not. When we do endoscopies we find deep ulcers, erosive gastritis with bleeding and similar conditions and with an intake of spices these could be worsened. When asked about milk, Dr. Jayasena said that the calcium in the milk stimulates the gastrin hormone, but this happens if you drink large amounts of milk. A little milk is always good because the stomach has already turned acidic. Milk being a basic liquid therefore will neutralize the acid. The other issue is that people develop lactose intolerance which is different from gastritis. For some people whatever that happens in the stomach and bowel is gastritis. When you take milk you get diarrhoea and a bloated feeling which are symptoms of lactose intolerance since their lactase enzyme is deficient. These patients shouldnt take any dairy products. There are regulatory mechanisms to regulate the influx and output. Sometimes they may get allergic to the proteins in the milk. Yoghurt is also good, but I advise them to use locally manufactured products. When probiotics are added, studies in other countries have found that the strains dont tally. Therefore this pathogen could be infective in that country. But locally manufactured products have local bacteria with local strains, he said.
Gastritis asa side effect
Gastritis is an effect of many other problems such as hiatus hernia. This is a common problem now especially among obese patients, added Dr. Jayasena. Due to the thickness of the abdominal wall and due to internal pressure, the stomach is pushed into the chest cavity through the hiatus. Then the sphincter muscle is displaced and it doesnt function properly. Therefore whatever the acids and food could be refluxed into the gullet causing problems. This could also bring about sinusitis, sore throat, laryngitis and various other conditions. With treatments like the keyhole surgery we can pass tubes and by looking at the video we could fix the defect. The hospital stay is also short and patients can fully recover. But if a person consumes alcohol or smokes the individual is vulnerable to gastritis too. If the cause of gastritis is the H. Piroli bacterial infection we have an antibiotic cause which is effective against these bacteria. It is a very resistant organism, but we have medicine for that. We also have special medicine for bile reflux to reduce the effects of bile. Sometimes the patient also has to follow instructions such as sleeping with the head raised or sleeping on the right side to empty the bowel quickly etc,Dr. Jayasena said.

Know your limitsof addiction
In his concluding remarks Dr. Jayasena expressed his concerns about the habits of the younger generation. The younger generation is addicted to coffee, barbecue or particular fizzy drinks. This is bad because they all can cause cancer. If you consume the same food for a long time, any food will become carcinogenic. Therefore the younger people should be advised about it. For example in the Middle Eastern countries coloured fizzy drinks are cheaper than water. Therefore the landlords consume water and the domestic consume any amount of these fizzy drinks. After consuming large amounts of these fizzy drinks they developed cancers in the gullet and a few young people died as well. Therefore it is advisable to not get addicted to food items which have preservatives, colours or taste enhancers, he said.

Getaway that ended in a poor toddy treat
	

A group of politicos paid a visit to some close kin of a prominent political leader at the periphery on invitation the other day.

The group who looked forward to a day of fun and pleasure was warmly welcomed by the host at his posh residence located on a sprawling 15-acre estate. He first took them round his novel showpiece  the models of Atamasthana - eight leading Buddhist shrines in the country put up on the estate.
The pilgrimage to Atamasthana over, the host now proposed that they accompany him to the bar inside his residence. The guests were thrilled that they could have a shot or two before a possible sumptuous lunch being readied for them. And they happily followed him to the bar.
However, it was not whiskey and brandy they were served, but coconut toddy from a big clay pot! However, there was not enough toddy to go around either. And what was offered as bites were pieces of fried dried fish.
What was worse was that the guests had to call it a day after the toddy treat for there was no invitation to lunch!
The group had their midday meal at a wayside restaurant on their way back to Colombo, they say.

Group of 16 tag-line no more: WDJ
	
Former United Freedom Peoples Alliance (UPFA) Minister W. D. J. Seneviratne, who defected the government along with 15 other UPFA members, yesterday said they should no longer be addressed as the 'group of 16 because they have decided to work together with the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP).
The MP expressed this view after meeting SLPP party leaders including its Chairman G. L. Peiris and National Organiser Basil Rajapaksa at party Head office in Battaramulla.
Speaking to journalists after the talks, MP Seneviratne said, We shouldnt be called the group of 16 any more. We decided to work together as one group to change the government. We have always been in the opposition since the day we left the government. There was no in between,
He said the discussions were cordial and helped diminish any ambiguousness and discrepancies among the two factions. When asked whether they would take the membership of the SLPP, the MP said there was no such need.
Meanwhile, MP Lakshman Yapa Abeywardane said they were invited by the SLPP to attend the next group meeting of the Joint Opposition (JO) which would be held early next week.
We accepted the invitation and we will attend the JO group meeting to be held under former President Mahinda Rajapaksas leadership at his residence in Colombo, he said.
He assured that they would work together with the JO as one anti-government group. With the support of other parties, we will work together on one stage to face upcoming elections, he said.

Hassan Esufally  the first Sri Lankan to complete the Big 5 Marathon
	
Hassan Esufally, one of Sri Lankas leading marathoners recently took on the ambitious mission of earning the prestigious and highly coveted 7 Continents Marathon Club membership. The challenging endeavour requires him to complete some of the worlds toughest and most exclusive marathons across all seven continents. Having completed marathons in Europe, North America, Asia and Australia, Esufally recently ran his first-ever marathon in Africa. Heres what he had to say about his unforgettable experience running the Big 5 Marathon  a tough 42 km run across the vast deserts, hills and savannahs of the wilds of the South African bush:
Q. In a nutshell, tell us about your experience in South Africa and what it felt like to be out there representing Sri Lanka
A. In a nutshell, this marathon was definitely one of the most memorable ones Ive ever run!The beautiful scenery and incredible wildlife combined with the warmth and hospitality of the South African people made it all the more exciting and special. It was also a great honour to be out there representing my country. Running past that finish line with the Sri Lankan flag hoisted high above my shoulders was a profound and exhilarating moment, and it gave me a fresh burst of motivation to keep pushing my boundaries in the upcoming marathons.
Q. Take us through the terrain and different stages of the marathon that you ran
A.In the first 5km, we had to run up and down a really steep hill, and at this point, I remember thinking to myself man, this is going to be a tough race. The 5-18km stretch was by far my favourite part of the marathon, as it was a more relaxed run on flat, scenic terrain with a fantastic variety of wildlife. The 18-30km stretch proved to be the hardest part of the race  the terrain changed dramatically and we found ourselves instantly transitioning from dirt track to sand that was ankle-deep, it was like running on a beach with extremely soft sand and looking back Im really glad that I trained with sand bags.During the 18km part of the race, I met this group of South African dancers along the way who were singing and dancing so I decided to join them for about two minutes to help get my mind off the pain. It was at this point I switched from having gels and electrolytes to having cola, water and bananas - a strategy that helped very much during the Ironman.
After this came a torturous 4km climb at a whopping 45 degree inclination! There was also a change in surface again from sand to asphalt, which made it difficult for me to adjust my running style. Taking 14 minutes to cover a kilometre, this was the slowest part of the marathon for me and I later joked with my wife that I slowly made it up the hill like a tortoise and almost sadistically there was a huge Welcome sign at the bottom of the hill. The next 30-40km section was extremely undulating with a lot of ascents and descents. There was however a lot more uphill than downhill and the gradual climb and increasing altitude made breathing a little difficult. The final 40-42.2km stretch took us back onto dirt track, but this time, with a lot of rocks scattered en-route that made it hard to find the right footing at times.
Q. Tell us a little bit about the unique experiences and encounters that you had along the way
A. Running amidst a fantastic variety of wildlife, just roaming about nonchalantly was definitely one of my favourite highlights.Running through the Entabeni Savannah, I could see rhino, giraffe, zebra and wilder beast, at which point I thought to myself thank goodness  no lions! Huge credit goes to the rangers who were tracking the lions all throughout the race, ensuring that they kept a distance of at least 5km from the marathoners. Seeing the animals up-close like that was an amazing experience, and it gave me an adrenaline rush which made me run much faster. I stopped occasionally to take a few pictures of the scenery and wildlife, as this marathon to me, personally, was more about the experience than the finishing time. At many points of the race and at the aid stations, we were also cheered on by traditional African drummers and singers, which made the experience so unique and authentic. There was something special about running to the beat of African drums, in stretches of pure, untainted wild bushland.
Q. What was unique about this marathon in comparison to the others that you have run What helped you to get through the toughest parts of the run
A. From the get-go to the finish line, I would have to say that the route and varying terrain, as well as the intense heat all made this marathon quite challenging in its own right. Each continent that Ive completed a marathon on so far, however does have its own set of challenges and weather conditions that you have to adapt to.That being said, this was definitely the most fun, beautiful and amazing run that I have completed.
Many months of training and my previous experience running long distance marathons in extreme conditions, helped me in some capacity to prepare for this marathon. However, when I was out there in the bush, trying my best to keep going, it was my wifes incredible support that helped me on. I remember looking up at the 14km mark and seeing my wife cheering me on in the spectator area, I saw her again at the 28km mark and seeing her there cheering me on, gave me the strength and encouragement that I needed to push through the pain I was in and persevere through the toughest stretches of the race. She has always been my biggest supporter and that has made all the difference for me during the toughest of runs.

Inquiry launched into PTL deleting voice recordings
	
Delivering an order on the parallel magisterial inquiry into the bond scam on the deletion of phone call data from the Perpetual Treasuries Ltd voice recording system and fabricating evidence to the Commission, Colombo Fort Magistrate today allowed the prosecution to compare the original DVDs from the PTL with the altered DVDs which the suspects handed over to the bond commission.
These DVDs contained voice recordings of the PTL's all phone conversations.
PTL owner Arjun Aloysius, CEO Kasun Palisena, chief dealer Nuwan Salgado and the IT executive Sachith Devathantri were held liable by the the CID on the instruction of the Attorney General in connection with the revelation which transpired during the proceedings of the Bond Commission.
Senior State Counsel Lakmini Girihagama appeared for the CID in the magisterial inquiry.
PTL had earlier told the Commission that it had given all the data it had with regard to the voice recording system. However, after confession made by PTL IT expert Sachith Devatantri and its chief dealer Nuwan Salgado, it was revealed that there was a deletion of some voice recordings.
Later the Attorney General instructed the CID to begin a criminal investigation on this matter.
Mr. Devathantri had on August 31, 2017 informed the PCoI that he had deleted several phone recordings from PTLs voice recording system on the instructions of Mr. Salgado on July 5, 2017.
He also disclosed that it was the altered phone recordings that were subsequently provided to the Commission in the latter part of August 2017, contrary to what PTLs CEO Kasun Palisena had said in his affidavit that they had provided all data to the commission. (Shehan Chamika Silva)

It's a bird, it's a plane, it's a... whale
	
Sporting eyes and a cheeky smile, Airbus' new BelugaXL plane has been given a makeover to make it look more like its animal namesake.
The aircraft's new guise was unveiled this week as it rolled out of the paint shop in Toulouse, France.
Airbus employees were asked to vote on a design for the plane, with 40 per cent voting in favour of the comical grin.
The Airbus A300-600ST made its maiden flight on September 13, 1994, and was officially called the Super Transporter.
However, it soon earned its nickname for the plane's uncanny resemblance to the white Beluga whale, with its distinctive hump on its head
The plane's monicker became so popular that it stuck, and was adopted for official use by Airbus shortly afterwards.
The odd-looking aircraft was specially modified to transport large plane parts such as wings between Airbus' European production factories and to its final assembly lines in France, Germany and Spain.
In 2004, the aircraft was used to transport relief to the Indian Ocean region following the devastating tsunami and in 2005, it delivered aid and medical supplies to the U.S. after Hurricane Katrina.
The new model BelugaXL is six metres longer and one metre wider than the BelugaST transporter it is replacing. It can also carry six more tonnes in weight.
An example of its payload is that it will be able to transport both wings of the A350 XWB jetliner at once, instead of the single wing currently accommodated on the BelugaST.
The aircraft is set to undertake ground tests before its first planned flight this summer. It will then enter service in 2019 with four more BelugaXLs in the pipeline. 
Airbus Transport International is a wholly owned subsidiary of Airbus Group. The group hires out the Beluga fleet to third parties for the charter flight. (Daily Mail)

Italy threatens to throw EU migration summit into chaos
	
BRUSSELS AFP June28, 2018 - Italys hardline new premier threatened Thursday to block a joint EU statement on migration at a summit that embattled German Chancellor Angela Merkel warned could decide the blocs fate. Rome has recently refused to let several migrant rescue boats dock at Italian ports, reviving fresh tensions despite the fact that numbers of arrivals have dipped sharply since the height of Europes migration crisis in 2015. 
Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, who heads Italys month-old populist and anti-immigration government, said he would refuse to endorse the conclusions of the meeting in Brussels if fellow leaders fail to do more to help Italy. 
Italy does not need more words, but concrete actions, Conte told reporters as he arrived at the summit. Its a possibility I hope not to consider, but if we reach that point, on my behalf we will not have shared conclusions.

5 killed in shooting at Maryland Newspaper
	
Five people are dead and at least two others were wounded in a shooting at the Capital Gazette newspaper in Annapolis, Maryland, officials announced at a news conference Thursday afternoon.
Acting Anne Arundel County Police Chief William Krampf confirmed an adult male suspect is in custody and being interrogated by law enforcement.
At a later news conference, Krampf said the suspect used a shotgun and had smoke grenades.
"This was a targeted attack," he said.
The newspaper had received threats through social media on Thursday, according to Krampf, who would describe them only as "general threats toward the Capital" that "indicated violence." Police are working to confirm who sent the threats.
Authorities apprehended the shooting suspect, a Maryland resident, without any exchange of gunfire, Krampf said.
On Thursday night, Anne Arundel officials released the names of the Capital Gazette employees killed in the shooting: Rebecca Smith, sales assistant; Gerald Fischman, editorial page editor; Wendi Winters, special publications editor; John McNamara, staff writer; and Robert Hiaasen, an assistant editor and columnist.
In a Facebook post Hiassen's brother Carl, a renown novelist, described Robert as "one of the most gentle and funny people I've ever known."
County Executive Steven Schuh told CNN four of the victims' bodies were found on the floor of the newsroom and a fifth person  a woman with severe wounds to her upper body  died after being evacuated to the University of Maryland's Shock Trauma Center.
At least two other wounded people "with less severe injuries" are being treated at Anne Arundel Medical Center, Schuh said.
It is unclear whether the shooting was limited to the newsroom or the gunman attacked people on other floors.
Krampf said his department interacts every day with the newspaper as it is the local paper for the county.
"We're here, we're invested, we're going to get this investigation right," he said.
Capital Gazette reporter Phil Davis shared details on Twitter, writing: "Gunman shot through the glass door to the office and opened fire on multiple employees."
Anthony Messenger, an intern for the newspaper, first tweeted about the shooting at 2:43 p.m. ET, writing, "Active shooter 888 Bestgate please help us."
Anne Arundel County Police spokesman Lt. Ryan Frashure confirmed that authorities arrived on the scene within 60 seconds of receiving a call about the shooting.
Annapolis Mayor Gavin Buckley praised law enforcement for its response, saying that if officers "were not there as quickly as they were it could have been a lot worse."
The newspaper's website lists 20 newsroom employees.
Frashure said during the news conference that law enforcement from Annapolis, nearby Howard County, the Maryland State Police and federal agencies were participating in the response.
He said authorities were focused on clearing the building and reuniting the people inside with their families. Families should go to the Lord & Taylor outlet at the nearby Annapolis Mall, he said.
Gov. Larry Hogan tweeted he was "absolutely devastated to learn of this tragedy," adding that he is in contact with authorities on the scene.
President Trump also tweeted about the incident, saying he had been "briefed on the shooting at Capital Gazette," and he offered "thoughts and prayers."
This is a breaking news story. As often happens in situations like these, some information reported early may turn out to be inaccurate. We'll move quickly to correct the record and we'll only point to the best information we have at the time. (Capital Public Radio)

LNG plant tender: German envoy questions transparency, openness
	
Stepping into the controversy surrounding the award of the tender for the Kerawalapitiya LNG power plant to a higher bidder, German Ambassador to Sri Lanka Jorn Rohde yesterday questioned the transparency and openness of the entire tender procedure.
The government has proposed to build a 300 Megawatt LNG power plant (Liquefied Natural Gas) in Kerawalapitiya.
Speaking to the Daily Mirror on the issue, he said there were a lot of questions in this case as the Procurement Appeal Board reversed the original decision to award the tender to the lowest bidder- LTL Holdings that uses German technology.
The Power and Energy Ministry Secretary is quoted in the Daily Mirror with a pledge to have open and transparent tender procedures. Sri Lanka needs to have an open and transparent tender process. I think there are a lot of questions, especially in this case. The lowest bidder was unanimously selected. That is LTL Holding (Lakdhanavi) using German technology. Suddenly, the Procurement Appeal Board reversed the decision. The questions raised,I am told,have all been answered in the selection process at Standing Cabinet Appointed Committee (SCAP) and at the Technical Evaluation Committee.
Only when an open and fair tender procedure is guaranteed, Sri Lanka will be an attractive place for Investors. Germany recently opened a trade office here. Also, I see it as a test case whether the Sri Lankan government claim to be a hub in South Asia is more thanrhetoric.
Also in Germany, these procedures are observed with close attention. I appealed to the government to guarantee that tender procedures are respected, he said.
It is learnt that Lakdhanavi is seeking a US$330 million loan for the project from Germany-based KfW Development Bank. The project is to be implemented by that company using German technology if the tender is granted. (Kelum Bandara)

Private or SOE
	
Is private sector efficient and decent the way it is projected



It is inefficiency, lack of competent managers and heavy politicisation
These ailments in the SOEs can be cured if this extremely corrupt and indecent political culture can be sanitised
That leaves unchecked and unregulated space for inhuman exploitation of cheap labour

Having stabilized the economy of the country over the past couple of years, Sri Lankas key priority right now is attracting foreign direct investments (FDIs)- Minister of Development Strategies and International Trade, Malik Samarawickrama at the Sri Lanka Investment and Business Conclave 2018.
The Committee on Public Accounts (CoPA) Report tabled in Parliament has startling revelations about State Owned Enterprises (SOE) that cost the country colossal sums of money.
On Monday, June 18, addressing a media workshop, Speaker Jayasuriya was reported as having said, the loss from SOEs was over Rs.50 billion.
Addressing the same workshop, Auditor General Gamini Wijesinghe was quoted as having said,
Weeratunge (former Presidential Secretary) was sentenced to jail over misappropriation of public funds. If other public officials are also treated the same way, more than half of them would end up in jail.
He had also said, the CB Bond Scam was not the only mega corruption in this country. From import of coal to import of rice, there had been many mega scams during the previous and the present regime.
One important fact that has to be noted here lest we forget is that all heavy corruption in the public sector has a filthy rich businessman behind them. In economic terms, its the private sector demand that the public sector meets in most, if not all corrupt deals.
Yet, corruption is not the highlighted reason for failure in SOE.
It is inefficiency, lack of competent managers and heavy politicisation. COPA says 26 Ministries dont have a work plan and 29 have not updated their fixed asset balance sheets. Obviously, there is no clear path created for SOEs to run efficiently and at a profit under such governance. The Fiscal Report 2017 of the Ministry of Finance listed 19 SOEs that run at a loss and has to be funded annually by the taxpayer money. The report tables their total loss to be Rs.35.3 billion during the first 08 months of 2016.
Identified reasons for SOE failures in general are, the appointment of political lackeys to Governing Boards, who are most often not qualified to be in such boards, using them to provide employment for political advantage ignoring cadre estimates and also lack of required expertise and management.
These ailments in the SOEs can be cured if this extremely corrupt and indecent political culture can be sanitised.
Yet, the political insanity is not what is questioned, in finding answers.
What is instead proposed as the only remedy by Economists, Institutional Specialists, Strategic Planners and the like is privatising SOEs, and within this same insanely corrupt political culture that decides and governs the whole process of privatisation too.
The direct explanation in promoting privatisation is that the private sector is efficient and always runs on profit-that, the private investments provide the motivation to run the business at a profit.
But how true is that Dont private sector companies go bankrupt
Over five years ago in January 2013, the then Minister of Labour Gamini Lokuge complained to President Rajapaksa that over 20 private investors have closed down their factories without any notice and have fled the country.
He told media that these company owners have not paid workers their due wages for many months, not paid EPF and ETF dues, not paid gratuity and have even defaulted loan payments in millions of rupees to local banks.
Many thousands have been thrown out of their jobs due to these crooked businesses suddenly putting up shutters.
They were all BOI-SL approved projects that promised to bring dollar investments and create permanent employment for Sri Lankans.
The situation in the private sector that enjoys plenty of incentives, is more chaotic than what then Labour Minister Gamini Lokuge said in 2013.
The Sunday Times (ST) on 2017 September 03 gave the number of factories closed as 721 during the period 2010 to 2016 and both years included, a figure they obtained on a RTI application made to the BOI-SL.
Of them, the ST news report revealed, 103 companies have been given BOI land as well, while all companies enjoyed tax concessions and duty waivers.
At an average, 103 companies have closed shop every year. A number of companies shut down in the year 2013 was 150 while the approved number had been 143, less than the number that closed down.
Further probing the issue, the ST reported that numbers provided by the BOI-SL and that given in the Auditor Generals Report differ.
It says:
The Auditor Generals Report also contains statistics. But the number of projects approved and the number of projects cancelled, suspended or closed down are different  and higher than those the BOI provided to the ST under RTI. Thus, the number of companies shut down could be at least a few dozens more than the 721 given by the BOI. To give a bigger number would leave a heavier blame on BOI and prove the failure of the private sector too.
What is also important here is that, this heavy failure in the most patronised sector in private business, is not just that they are given financial and monetary concessions, infrastructure and in some instances even free electricity, but are given the benefit of unofficially relaxing labour and industrial law and at times deciding in favour of investments against due justice for employees.
That leaves unchecked and unregulated space for inhuman exploitation of cheap labour. That provides the explanation why in all FTZs and Industrial Zones that total 14, and the whole country now turned under the BOI-SL having around 2,200 factories operating, there are only 04 companies that have Collective Agreements and none in the Apparel Sector that talks of Clean Cloth.
No major apparel manufacturer allows trade unions and there are not more than two dozen companies in the whole private sector under the BOI that have accepted trade unions as legal bargaining agents of workers.

What is instead proposed as the only remedy by Economists and the like is privatising SOEs, and within this same insanely corrupt political culture 

That is, in a country that guarantees right to association including trade unions in its Constitution, abides by the UN Human Rights Charter, has signed and ratified ILO Conventions 87 and 93 and last year regained EU GSP Plus on condition it would guarantee human rights, labour rights and environmental safety.
In a discussion document titled Degeneration of the judicial process - How it affects Labour Rights and Justice shared by Free Trade Zone & General Services Employees Union (FTZ&GSEU) with Sri Lankan member unions of IndustriAll Global Union, it is said:
Labour Tribunals chaired by a President that were established with stress on conciliation for the convenience of workers have now been turned into traditional Courts by their Presidents. Though without any legal provision and in violation of the whole concept of a Tribunal, they have now been restricted to the legal profession by these presidents. Thus they have also become more unduly advantageous to employers.
This discussion document goes on to say:
From policy makers and decision makers in the Labour Ministry and department to the high posts in the judiciary, the mindset is, all decisions taken should be in favour of investment and should not in any way deter incoming investors. Thus it is no easy task for workers to seek justice and fair play and have their rights established.
It is with State decisions made in favour of investors and all such advantages piggybacking tax and duty waivers, concessions and infrastructure facilities, that over 721 businesses have gone bankrupt for seven years. Reasons for all those closures have not been workers. Not work stoppage. Quoting BOI Media and Publicity Director Samarasinghe on reasons for such closures the ST says:
Many of the reasons for these closures are internal to the companies, such as cash flow problems and market issues. In some cases, it is noncompliance with BOI agreement. For instance, not investing the amount they were expected to.
Job losses from these closures are generally not very significant to Samarasinghe and perhaps to the BOI too. Yet his response also reveals that even the much-hyped apparel sector too have bankruptcies and throw out workers.
In the apparel sector or other areas of manufacturing, there are possibilities of re-hiring he has told the ST.
We have for the last 40 years, except in a very few instances, provided heavy incentives and concessions to FDIs that suddenly put up shutters and flee the country.
Once discussing this issue, Anton Marcus, Joint Secretary of FTZ&GSEU told me, these investors dont bring any money into the country. They collaborate with local businessmen, who facilitate local bank loans and when they flee the country shutting down factories, they leave huge unpaid debts behind.
The fact is BOI continues to approve such projects as established investors like Motorola, that President Jayewardene said was waiting to come and the Volkswagen assembly plant PM Wickremesinghe promised, never come, added Anton Marcus. The unanswered question, therefore, is, How dependable, how efficient and how decent is the private sector that is being promoted against SOEs
Far more important is the question, can this free market economy provide for any better private investor and how capable is this yahapalanaya to put things right
Pardon my French, but they have done bugger all and it is a Right Royal .

## Title: Put these criminals behind bars!

Put these criminals behind bars!
	

The recent spate of killings by members of the underworld has made the Government accept that the situation must be checked before it gets out of hand. This was confirmed by reports related to the recent Defence Council Meeting-chaired by President Maithripala Sirisena- during which there was a huge showing of concern regarding the underworld raising itsugly head. 
Just last month Sri Lanka celebrated the ninth anniversary after the ruthless tiger rebels were crushed. That hard-earned peace has in recent times been shattered by incidents of shootings, rape, killings and looting. The perpetrators have been members of criminal gangs and whats worrying is that they have links with politicians. 
One of the much talked about recent incidents is the looting of a jewellery shop in Matara during which criminal Chamara Jayasundara was shot dead. The police later deployed seven squads to arrest suspects involved in criminal activities. Following some of the rounding up operations it was revealed that one of the suspects was the son of a mother, who had contested the last LG Polls representing a party supporting the Unity Government. These are links which can delay the law from taking its course. 
Defence Minister Ruwan Wijewardene said early this week that the Government was set to curb underworld activities with the assistance of the three forces. Given that large sums of money are being pumped into boosting national security the fervent plea of law abiding citizens of this country is for the Government to maintain law and order. 
Amid this gloom there was some healthy news too. Police Spokesman Ruwan Gunasekara was quoted in newspapers stating that the law enforcement officers had carried out a four-hour raid recently during which 2322 arrests were made. Out of the arrests 635 were related to criminal activities, 531 to peddling illicit drugs or alcohol, 78 to unruly behaviour and 5 to possessing weapons. What many opine is that the police should do these rounds on a random basis and not as a response to a rise in the crime rate. 
The time when criminal activities started happening in an organised manner dates back to the era of Gonawala Sunil. Sunil, having affiliations with the UNP, was instrumental in the massacre of 53 inmates at the Welikada Prison in 1983. But during then too it seemed that these underworld characters were heavily backed by politicians. Sunil was put behind bars, but was released thanks to a presidential pardon extended to him by former President J.R. Jayewardene, just before the 1982 presidential elections. Sunil was even made an all-island JP. 
We had our bad times with underworld criminals in the likes of Soththi Upali, Amarasinghe brothers Chanthika and Dhammika, Kaduwela Wasantha, Baddagane Sanjeewa, Moratu Saman, Karate Dhammika, Wambotta, Thel Bala, Nawala Nihal and most recently Wele Suda. All these underworld characters were made larger than life personalities by two sections of the society; the politicians and the press. 
The media too have to take some responsibility in making unwanted heroes out of these shaky characters by sensationalising their stories. The rest of the damage is done to the society when politicians give these criminals membership in their political parties.
Politicians need these criminals to do their dirty work. Some of these criminals had fled the country defying arrest warrants because they had the backing of politicians. Some own luxury apartments here and residencies abroad. Even if they do get caught their stay at the prison is nothing short of being luxurious. 
During the Mahinda Rajapaksa regime members of the underworld went into a shell. Most of them migrated abroad. But that menace was replaced by a white van culture which made things worse. Killings and abductions were carried out under state patronage. What the people of this country need now is for the law to be strong and the police to deal swiftly with criminals who breach the law. Its time once again to protect innocent lives in this country!

## Title: RALLY IN NEGOMBO GOVT. FUNDS ALLEGEDLY USED FOR MAHINDA'S ELECTION CAMPAIGN

RALLY IN NEGOMBO GOVT. FUNDS ALLEGEDLY USED FOR MAHINDA'S ELECTION CAMPAIGN
	

Following the recommendations made by the Presidential Commission of Inquiry into Serious Acts of Fraud and Corruption (PRECIFAC), the Attorney General last week filed indictments against those who have misappropriated public funds to conduct an election rally in Negombo in the run up to the 2015 Presidential Elections. 

The indictments were filed against former Acting Fisheries Minister Sarath Kumara Gunaratne, his Private Secretary/ son-in-law Upul Chaminda Perera Kumarasinghe, former Chairman CFHC Upali Liyanage, former General Manager Galapitagedara Piyal Abeysekara, former Deputy General Manager Chandana Pelpita and former acting Supplies Manager Lakmina Munidasa under the Public Property Act for misappropriation of public money to build the image of the presidential candidate Mahinda Rajapaksa in the guise of a ceremony to lay the foundation stone of the Negombo Lagoon Development Project. 
Former Acting Fisheries Minister and the then Management of Ceylon Fisheries Harbour Corporation (CFHC) is accused of misappropriating public funds to the tune of a staggering Rs.11.47 million to hold a UPFA election meeting at the Municipal Grounds in Negombo on December 30, 2014 -nine days prior to the 2015 Presidential Elections in support of Rajapaksas candidature. 
This money, spent for the meeting, is said to have been obtained from the funds allocated for the Negombo Lagoon Development Project. 
But, according to reliable CFHC sources, who wished to remain anonymous, the laying of the foundation stone had taken place on January 4, 2015 under the patronage of the then Economic Development Minister Basil Rajapaksa. 
The PRECIFAC report has raised concern as to why General Manager Piyal Abeysekara, who is also allegedly accused in the fraud, was allowed to remain in office at the time the inquiry was in progress. The report further states, How can the CFHC employees be testified against the wrongdoers including the General Manager when the latter is still functioning as the GM as he could be a threat to those who give evidence against the offenders The Commission recommends his immediate removal until the inquiry is over. 
According to the PRECIFAC report, it was revealed how the accused party had threatened to remove Finance Manager CHFC Nayana Samanthi Perera from employment if she did not approve payment for the service providers. Despite of the threats, Perera had not authorized a few payment vouchers, saving Rs.3.95 million to CFHC.

Notwithstanding, the Commission has also made a request to the Government not to appoint any of those who were involved in financial frauds to any government institution jobs, pointing the finger at the present regime for appointing the accused former Deputy General Manager Chandana Pelpita as a Working Director to the Fertilizer Corporation. 

Payment to lawyer
Meanwhile the report also reveals how the Board of Directors that was appointed during the 100-day programme in the Good Governance Administration had approved a payment of Rs.120,000 for a lawyer who accompanied the accused General Manager Piyal Abeysekara when he was testified before the PRECIFAC. 
However, following the recommendation of the PRECIFAC, Abeysekara had been later removed from CFHC, according to the sources. 
A whopping sum of Rs. 8.95 million had been spent to erect the main stage and the tents for the meeting while another Rs. 1.848 million had been paid to construct the Lagoon Development Project plaque, Rs. 1.25 million for caps and T-shirts for party supporters who attended the meeting, Rs.175, 000 to hire large LED TV screens to be used at the venue of the meeting and Rs. 1.09 million to print 2000 desk diaries to be distributed (at the meeting). 
According to the CFHC sources, Display Media Advertising was offered the contract for Rs. 8.95 million to put up the stage and marquees, to supply VVIP and VIP chairs and 10,000 plastic chairs for the general public, a dancing troupe and a musical group, to provide music for the dancers in between the speeches. 
The contract to print 2,000 desk diaries for Rs. 1.09 million had also been given to Display Media Advertising. 
Frontier 7 International Pvt Ltd had been offered the contract to build a plaque at the Negombo lagoon site for Rs. 1.848 million. Arjuna Graphics, Negombo had been offered the contract to supply T-shirts and caps for the party supporters for Rs.1.255 million. 
According to sources from Arjuna Graphics, Frontier 7 International Pvt Ltd and Display Media Advertising, the meetings were held at Acting Minister Sarath Gunaratnes office. These meetings were attended by Chairman, General Manager, Deputy General Manager and some other officials from CFHC who discussed how work had to be carried out at the proposed project site.

According to Display Media Advertising, their estimate to provide their service for the election meeting was Rs.8.95 million and it had been approved by the Chairman, General Manager and the Deputy General Manager of CFHC. The venue was Kattuwa in Negombo which is adjoining the lagoon. But later this venue was shifted to Municipal Grounds due to heavy rains. 
We started our work on December 22, 2014. On December 25, we were told that the venue had been shifted to Municipal Grounds by which time we had started erecting the stage. We had to dismantle the stage and the marquees and transport the goods to the new venue, which was two-and-a-half Kilo metres away, sources said. 

Quotation accepted sans bargaining
According to the sources, Display Media Advertising had earlier provided their service to CFHC and that was why they had been offered the Negombo contract. It was the former acting Fisheries Minister Chairman Upali Liyanage, General Manager Piyal Abeysekera and Deputy General Manager Chandana Pelpita who were directly involved in this project. Quotations were not called from any of those who provided their services to make the event a success. Our company was asked to give our quotation which was accepted without bargaining. The contract was given in mid-December and on the day we completed our work we were paid Rs. 5 million. Two days before the Presidential Election we were issued with a cheque amounting to Rs. 3 million. However I could not get it cashed as the bank had received instructions from the new Board of Directors to stop the payments. All attempts thereafter to obtain the balance of Rs.3.95 million proved futile, the sources claimed. 
			What is wrong in spending a few millions for a ceremony...former Minister
			
			The accused former Minister Gunaratne when contacted said that he cannot make any comments as the matter is now in courts, but added that neither he nor the officials at CFHC is at fault. 
			When asked as to why they did not follow procurement guidelines, Gunaratne said that it was not his duty to follow these rules, but of the officials at the CFHC. Once I gave them the instructions, they had to follow Government procedures.
			What is wrong in spending a few millions in connection with the ceremony to lay the foundation stone for the project It was the then President who graced the occasion.
			Although we did not have much time to organize the event, as President Rajapaksa accepted the invitation in mid-December, we had to accelerate the work. But that does not mean we misappropriated public funds, Gunaratne said.
			
		
The sources further revealed how they got the contract to print 2,000 desk diaries, for Rs.1.09 million, through a deal done over the phone. The Deputy General Manager offered us the contract to print and supply 2,000 diaries within six days. Since it was difficult to print 2,000 diaries within six days, we undertook to deliver 500 copies by December 30, and the rest on two separate dates, he added. 
Meanwhile, Arjuna Dhananjaya of Arjuna Graphics and Printers, Negombo, who was given the contract to supply T-shirts and caps for Rs.1.255 million, said that he cannot remember how many T-shirts and caps had the wordings printed on. 
We were offered the contract to supply T-shirts and caps, but cannot remember how much I supplied as this happened almost four years ago. I knew Minister Gunaratne personally as it was I who printed Gunaratnes posters and banners for his campaign. In T-shirts and caps I was asked to print Gamanasubai, Jaya niyathai  Mahinda Rajapaksa and Meegamuwa Sarath Kumara Gunaratne respectively, Arjuna told the Dailymirror.
When asked what his quotation was to supply T-shirts and caps, Arjuna said that he could not remember the amount, but added that the quotation figure was not given in writing but over the phone to the Ministers Private Secretary. Once we handed over the T-shirts and caps I was paid the full amount and when I was testified before the PRECIFAC, I told them how I got the contract. I revealed how the money was paid to me when I supplied the T-shirts and the caps. There was nothing for me to hide as I have not done any wrong. I only carried out a business, Arjuna claimed. 
However, according to Frontier 7 International Pvt Ltd, they have given their quotation in writing and have been paid for the work they have carried out except for the VAT component. They have met the CFHC officials in the second week of December and were asked to finish the construction of the plaque by January 3, 2015 as they were planning to lay the foundation stone the following day. 
The new administration of CFHC after the fall of the Rajapaksa regime sent a letter, demanding them to refund Rs. 900,000, claiming that the feasibility report which was undertaken by the University of Moratuwa had stated that the contractor had overcharged for the construction work which could have been carried out for Rs.700,000. 

In a rush
We never asked them to give this contract to our company, but it was they who chose us and when requested to give our estimate we gave our price. The previous management was in a rush to get all the work done for the Negombo Election meeting within 10 to 15 days.
If they planned the ceremony well in advance and followed Government procurement guidelines they could have offered the construction to the lowest bidder.
We were asked to appear before the PRECIFAC to give evidence in this regard. We are not the only party that has the technology and skill to carry out these constructions. We did not go behind them asking to offer the contract to us. The price given by us is our standard price. The issue was with the previous CFHC administrators as they wanted to get the work done in a rush, sources from the Frontier 7 International Pvt Ltd added. 
The CFHC sources said that they informed the PRECIFAC how payments were made to the contractors prior to obtaing Procurement Boards approval. 
Giving evidence before the PRECIFAC, the CFHC employees had told how the Acting Fisheries Minister and the CFHC bypassed the government procurement guidelines when offering the contracts to the parties known to them personally and how they obtained the estimates over the phone, paid a 50% advance and got the work done within few weeks.
The employees have also informed the Commission as to how the Ministry and CFHC officials ignored their protest against holding an election meeting in the guise of a foundation stone laying ceremony at a time when the Elections Commissioner had released guidelines to all government departments and corporations not to violate his instructions. Giving evidence the employees had further revealed how the then acting Minister refused to abide by the election guidelines and went ahead with the proposed meeting claiming that spending money and holding an opening ceremony attended by the countrys Executive was not a waste of money. They had further revealed how the acting Minister acknowledged their failure to follow procurement guidelines as there was no time to get prepared for Rajapaksas visit as his visit was confirmed in mid- December.

SL should join India, China to reap benefits of trade arrangements: PM
	
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said today Sri Lanka should join India, China and other countries to reap the benefits of trade arrangements such as, the Belt and Road initiative and Asia- Africa trade corridor initiative.
He said this at the Dr. Saman Kelegama Memorial Conference held in Colombo.
Regardless of what the newspapers say, the leaders are having discussions on their own to ensure there is no rivalry. We have the interests of the Europeans in this region. Britain after leaving the European Union is showing interest in our region. The US talks of Indo-Pacific trade but what is happening with the US is a question with the tariff that has been imposed both in Europe and in Africa. However we are seeing this region taking an initiative in having its own trade region outside Japan, India and China. First is the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership which has some more rounds of negotiations with India raising issues. However, that will be over. We have to join India, China and others, we cannot be left behind, he said.
You can be against the FTA with China and against other agreements. Without them where will we go then We have to plan and take all the development into account. This will no longer be a small island. There are those whose mindsets are governed by Laski and Fabish who think small. We are thinking of a big nation. Fortunately we are not guided by those who follow Laski and Fabish but by the policies of King Parakrama Bahu, he said. (Yohan Perera)

SSA students to represent SL at World Choir Games
	

Settled on the floor of the Soul Sounds Academy (SSA) in Thimbirigasyaya, three dozen children are getting a pep talk on discipline, teamwork and competition. In a few days, the 33-strong group will leave for South Africa to represent Sri Lanka at the World Choir Games (WCG). And training has entered its last gruelling week. 
Its not just about singing, SSA Directress Soundarie David Rodrigo tells them. You have to work together as a group; to help each other and look out for each other. You must be disciplined. You can have fun but dont lose focus on the competition. Whether it is winning a gold or showing you are from this tiny little country called Sri Lanka, do your best.
Pep talk before departure

WCG is the largest choral event in the world. It is organised by the Interkultur Foundation on the principle: Singing together brings nations together. The 10th edition takes place from July 4 to 14 at Tshwane in South Africa

WCG is the largest choral event in the world. It is organised by the Interkultur Foundation on the principle: Singing together brings nations together. The 10th edition takes place from July 4 to 14 at Tshwane in South Africa. There will be two choirs from Sri Lanka. One is the Royal College Choir, conducted by Sureka Amerasinghe, which will compete in the mixed youth choirs, pop and folklore categories.
And the other is the SSA Childrens Choir, conducted by Dinushka Jayawickreme and Amandhi Caldera. They will compete in the childrens choir and scenic folklore categories. After several months of intense practices, the kids -- aged between eight and 15 -- are revving to go. What unites them is their passion for music and love for singing, reflected Soundarie. 
Accompanying them to South Africa will be Dinushka and Amandhi, renowned pianist Ramya De Livera, traditional drummer Ravibandu Vidyapathi and artistic director Jerome de Silva who had travelled with the Soul Sounds Choir on all international tours.
The focus of WCG, the organisers say, is on participation above winning. But the SSA team is setting its sights high. Some of the competition judges this year were in Sri Lanka for the Asia Pacific Choir Games in 2017 and are aware that the country has immense talent. The SSA singers -- having worked with the respected Ravibandu and drawn from his knowledge of traditional music and dancing -- are particularly optimistic about their skills in the folklore category. 
When it comes to our rhythms and beats, I dont think any other music has emphasis on drum beats as much as Sri Lankan music does, said Amandhi. Our choice of music in the other category is also very good with very intricate harmonies.
While they have previously competed as singers in competitions abroad, this is Amandhis and Dinushkas first experience as conductors on tour. It is a different experience, one of transferring our experience and knowledge to the next generation of singers, said Dinushka. 
The kids will also have to acclimatise quickly and focus on the competition. It is a completely new country and setting and they will be dealing with things like jetlag, she explained. And it is very personal, not like an instrument. Voices can get affected by external factors. That will be the biggest challenge.

Royal College Choir, conducted by Sureka Amerasinghe,will compete in the mixed youth choirs, pop and folklore categories. While the SSA Childrens Choir, conducted by Dinushka Jayawickreme and Amandhi Caldera, will compete in the childrens choir and scenic folklore categories

But there is no substitute for the musical experience and exposure the singers will get at the WCG. We live in a bubble here, Dinushka said. Granted, it has developed a lot since the first time we toured abroad and realised we could do things like that with our voices. We learned so much from international choirs and that learning experience was what we cherished the most. I hope these kids will also benefit from it because they are getting it at such a young age.
The SSA Childrens Choir will also perform in a friendship concert with other choirs in public venues in and around the city of Tshwane. These free public concerts provide opportunities to choirs to showcase their musical traditions and costumes of their native land.

Trump and Putin will meet in Helsinki on July 16
	

WASHINGTON - President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin will meet on July 16 in Helsinki, Finland, both of their governments announced Thursday.
The meeting, planned in recent days, signals a growing rapprochement between the United States and Russia. Both men have pursued the tete-a-tete in hopes of soothing tensions over Russias interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election and its aggression in Ukraine and elsewhere, despite retaliatory actions taken by both governments this year.
The two leaders will discuss relations between the United States and Russia and a range of national security issues, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said in a statement.
Finland, officially neutral during the Cold War and not a NATO member, shares a border with Russia, and its president, Sauli Niinisto, has fostered a relationship with Putin.
The date falls after previously planned stops during a trip to Europe by Trump for a NATO summit meeting July 11-12 in Brussels and a visit to Britain on July 13. It also allows Putin to be in Moscow for the World Cup final on July 15.
Plans for the Trump-Putin summit were finalized on Wednesday by national security adviser John Bolton, who held marathon meetings in Moscow that included talks with Putin himself at the Kremlin. Trump has long sought to cultivate a warm friendship with his Russian counterpart as a means to solving intractable problems around the world, and he has said he admires the strength of Putins authoritarian rule.

What does the colour of your urine indicate 
	

Urine is a liquid waste produce and excrete by our urinary system in order to remove waste products from our body. This process helps regulate the volume and composition of blood. Urine composition is mainly affected by 3 factors namely nutritional status, state of our metabolic process and ability of the kidney to selectively handle the material presented to it. Human urine consists primarily of water with various organic solutes including urea, creatinine, uric acid, trace amount of enzymes, hormones, pigments, mucins and inorganic ions such as sodium, potassium, chloride, magnesium, calcium, ammonium, sulfates and phosphates. 
Urine analysis can provide useful information on various diseases and health conditions while it is a convenient and cost effective method. Urine analysis involves physical, chemical and microscopic examination and urine sediment. Normally clinical examination of urine is recommended by doctors for a number of reasons, including routine medical evaluations (screening of kidney disease, diabetes mellitus, liver disease, etc.), assessment of specific symptoms ( abdominal pain, painful urination, flank pain, blood in the urine or other urinary symptoms), diagnosis of medical conditions ( urinary tract infection, kidney stones, uncontrolled diabetes, kidney impairment, muscle breakdown, protein in urine, kidney inflammation) and monitoring of disease progression and response to therapy (diabetes related kidney disease, lupus related kidney disease, blood pressure related kidney disease, etc.). 
Today Health Capsule discusses how we can make predictions about our health by studying the physical appearance of a urine sample. So we can get a general idea about our body condition and we can confirm it by doing a medical test to avoid delaying the identification of a disease and receive medical treatments for specific chronic diseases. 
1. Colour and appearance 
A healthy persons urine is clear and pale yellow in color. The yellow color of urine is due to presence of yellow color pigments urochrome. Generally a high solute volume in urine increases the colour intensity of urine. A deviation from the normal colour of urine can be caused by certain drugs and vegetables such as carrot, beets, etc. 

Normal urine is clear. The appearance of cloudy urine indicates a sign of possible abnormalities such as presence of pus cells or bacteria

Colourless: Happens due to drinking a high amount of water, diabetes mellitus, alcohol intake and intake of drugs which increase the production of urine (diuretics). 
Milky: Sign of urinary tract infection by bacteria.

But due to unavailability or having a little amount of urobilinogen in urine than in normal range, it indicates improper liver function.
