Deputy Media Minister condemns attack on journalist
	
While condemning the conduct of the Navy Commander who attacked a journalist covering a protest at the Hambantota Port last Saturday, Deputy Mass Media Minister Karunarathna Paranavithana said yesterday that the navy commander should have kept in mind the people?s mandate given to the government.
?We cannot approve of the conduct of and the language used by the Sri Lanka Navy Commander. The navy chief should have thought about the situation in the country and about the mandate given by the people to this government and that all these officials are under the people?s mandate,? he said.
?We regret the harassment the journalist underwent at the hands of navy commander? he said.
He made this observation at a discussion under the theme, ?Is the media freedom carrying out attack and looking for media ethics?? organised by the Young Journalists' Association, at the Government Information Department yesterday.
However, the deputy minister also said that the Navy was bound by law to protect the port and the ships, and the Navy had been summoned there to release the ships. ?We could not have done that using the Police,? he said.
He said that, according to his understanding, the navy commander should be physically be present on such occasions.
A number of media activists and senior journalists who participated in the discussion condemned the attack on the journalist by Navy Commander Ravindra Wijegunaratne and protested against the government?s attempts to mislead the people by saying it was a hostile situation and the journalist had violated journalistic ethics.
Chandana Sirimalwatte, Editor of Lanka newspaper said the country was not under martial law and condemned the conduct of the navy chief and other navy personnel. ?There is no difference between the way the military behaved in Rathupaswela under the Mahinda Rajapaksa government and how it behaved here,? he said.
?When there was a trade union action, what right had the navy commander to come and attack the journalist who was reporting it?? he asked.
?Why did the Government Information Department's Director General Ranga Kalansooriya forget to talk about whether what the government did was correct or not before talking about media ethics?? the Lanka Editor asked.
He also refuted Mr. Kalansooriya's allegation that the journalist had violated ?basic ethical practice when reporting a sensitive conflict situation.?
?Before talking about media ethics we want to ask government what action it has taken with regard to the journalists who were killed under the previous regime,? he said.
There is no difference between the Mahinda Rajapaksa government and this government when comes to dealing with journalists,? Sirimalwatte said.
Dr. Ranga Kalansooiya, who attended the discussion, said that he condemned the attack on the journalist by the navy commander.
Referring to his earlier statement about the violation of ethics by the journalist, Dr. Kalansooriya admitted that his statement could have been misunderstood.
?When I re-read (on the following day) the statement that I had issued, I felt it could have given a wrong impression. I regret it. I had no intention of condoning the attack,?he said.
He said there was a violation of an ethical code, but there were no written laws in this regard. ?There are no laws, but journalists are bound by agreements,? he said.
Though there were no specific written laws with regard to media ethics, the journalist who was attacked could be faulted for violating the code of ethics with regard to minimising harm to himself and his fraternity, he said.
Meanwhile, Seetha Ranjani, the convener of the Free Media Movement and M. M. Ameen, the president of the Sri Lanka Muslim Media Forum strongly condemned the attack and insisted that the government give an assurance that such attacks would be stopped and journalists would be allowed to carry out their duties freely in future.

Govt. selling national resources to foreign countries: Dullas
	
The Sri Lanka Police, the Justice Ministry and the Prisons Department will be the only state-owned institutions if the government continues to administer the country till 2020, the joint opposition said today.
JO MP Dullas Alahapperuma told a media conference that the country's economic hubs would vanish if the government sells our national resources to foreign countries like the move to sell 80 per cent of the Hambantota Harbour to a Chinese company.
?During the tenure of former president Mahinda Rajapaksa, the government annexed properties but the opposite is happening now,? he said.
Mr. Alahapperuma said the Yahapalana government was repeatedly breaking the promises it had made to the people.
He said the government remained silent on the alleged assault on a journalist by the Navy Commander at the Hambantota harbour.
?If it had happened during the previous government, the attack may have been interpreted this as an order from Mr. Rajapaksa,? Mr. Alahapperuma said.
MP Keheliya Rambukwella said Sri Lanka would be transformed into a Chinese, Indian and American colony by 2020 considering what this government was doing. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)

India court bans liquor shops on highways
	
India's top court has ordered all liquor shops to shut down along state and national highways in an attempt to reduce drink driving and road accidents.
The court told the government to stop issuing new licences and renewing existing ones after 31 March.
More than 146,000 people died last year in traffic accidents in the country.
About 5% - or 6,755 - deaths were caused by drivers who had either been drunk or had taken drugs.
"(There should be) no liquor vends on national and state highways," AFP news agency quoted Chief Justice TS Thakur, who headed the three-judge bench, as saying in his order on Thursday.
The court also said that all liquor advertisements should be removed from the highways and shops selling alcohol must be located at least 500 metres (1,640 feet) away from them.
Campaigners say the large number of liquor shops located along the highways are "a great temptation and a distraction for road users".
Alcohol is banned in four Indian states (Gujarat, Bihar, Manipur and Nagaland) and the union territory of Lakshadweep. There's a partial ban on sale of alcohol in the southern state of Kerala. (BBC)

Murdoch?s 21st Century Fox clinches $14.8bn Sky buy
	
LONDON AFP Dec15, 2016 ??
Rupert Murdoch?s 21st Century Fox on Thursday sealed a $14.8-billion (14-billion-euro) cash deal to take control of pan-European pay-TV giant Sky and create a global entertainment titan. ??
The Murdoch-controlled Fox group said in a statement that it has reached a formal agreement to buy the 61-percent stake in Sky that it does not already own. ??
The deal valuing Sky at 18.5 billion comes five years after Australian-born media mogul Murdoch failed to clinch a takeover after a notorious phone-hacking scandal at his newspaper empire. ??
??The strategic rationale for this combination is clear,? 21st Century Fox said in a statement issued in New York. London-listed Sky last week revealed that it had agreed to an informal cash offer of 10.75 per share from 21st Century Fox.?

Ranil, Sampanthan reach out to Mahinda
	
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and leader of Opposition and the Tamil National Alliance R. Sampanthan have sought former President Mahinda Rajapaksa?s support for the ongoing constitutional reform efforts in Sri Lanka.
In the first instance of reaching out to the former President, ousted in the presidential and parliamentary elections of 2015, the leaders asked Mr. Rajapaksa, as ?a senior and respected leader?, to back the national unity government and other political parties working with it to remake the country?s Constitution, The Hindu learns.
The meeting held at the Prime Minister?s office in Parliament last week was reportedly prompted by President Maithripala Sirisena, who is said to be keen that the former President be brought on board while the country embarks on a new Constitution. It was President Sirisena, political sources close to him said, who asked the Prime Minister and the senior Tamil leader to engage Mr. Rajapaksa on the subject.
When contacted, Mr. Sampanthan confirmed that the meeting took place. ?Our efforts should continue given Mahinda Rajapaksa?s own efforts to evolve an acceptable constitutional arrangement during his term in office,? he said, referring to reports from an earlier All Party Representative Committee and an experts? committee that recommended some measures of devolution.
Soon after it came to power, Sri Lanka?s first national unity government ? with President Sirisena of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party and Prime Minister Wickremesinghe of the rival United National Party at its helm ? decided to remake the country?s Constitution, with the aim of solving the long-pending Tamil question.
Different groups in Parliament recently submitted their proposals on constitutional reforms to the government. The reports are scheduled to be debated in Parliament in January 2017, after which the matter will be put for vote. Following passage with two-thirds majority, the country is likely to go for a referendum where every citizen will get to vote on the new Constitution.
Departing from his earlier promises as President to ?go beyond? the 13th Amendment ? an outcome of the Indo-Sri Lanka Accord of 1987 that envisaged substantive devolution of powers to the provinces ? Mr. Rajapaksa has slammed draft proposals for the new Constitution, opposing suggested reforms on devolving land and police powers to the provinces. While Prime Minister Wickremesinghe, in a recent interview to The Hindu, was confident of having the numbers in Parliament to pass the reforms, Mr. Rajapaksa?s supporters ? he remains considerably popular among the Sinhala majority ? will be crucial to a favourable vote in the island-wide referendum.
Mr. Rajapaksa, who now sits in Opposition in Parliament, has the support of nearly 50 MPs identifying themselves as the ?Joint Opposition?, in effect causing a rift within the SLFP part of which cohabits the government. The former President has accused his successor government of being vindictive, in targeting members of his family and other associates charged of offences ranging from corruption to murder.
While Mr. Rajapaksa is yet to voice support to the government's reform agenda, Mr. Sampanthan said: ?He should have no difficulty in becoming part of the current process.? (Source: The Hindu)

Ruwan refutes MR?s accusation over Navy
	
State Defence Minister Ruwan Wijewardene today refuted former President Mahinda Rajapakse's accusation that the navy was sent to sabotage the Hambantota protest and it was a deliberate act to tarnish the Navy's image.
?I completely refute former president Mahinda Rajapakse's accusation,? State Minister Wijewardene said.
He said that the Navy was deployed to the Hambantota port to secure and release two ships that were held captive by the protesters. The ships were of Japanese and Singaporean origin. ?When ships are held captive, that amounts to piracy and the navy has the right to use the appropriate force needed to secure the ships in such a situation,? he said.
He also said there was a genuine threat of sabotage not only to the two ships but also to the oil tanks situated near the port.
?The protesters had already damaged the gantry trains, tug boats, pilot boats and generators. The total cost of damages are more than Rs. 15 million, excluding the 400,000 US dollars we have to pay as damages for the ships,? he said.
?Does the former President want Sri Lanka to be branded as a safe harbour for pirates like in Somalia?" he questioned. The reputation of Sri Lanka was at threat and the Navy's action protected the image of our country.
?This is all a political game played by the Joint Opposition. These employees were not at any point employed by the Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA), but were hired through a manpower company during the time of the former regime. If they are so concerned about these protesters why did they not employ them directly to the SLPA labour force at that time??
?Such actions and statements are not only disrespecting the navy but also creating a bad image of Sri Lanka to the rest of the world,? the State Minister added.

Sarkozy campaign funding trial moves closer
	
PARIS AFP Dec15, 2016 ??
Former French president Nicolas Sarkozy moved closer to facing trial over a campaign funding scandal on Thursday when a bid to halt proceedings against one of the suspects in the case was rejected. ??
The Paris appeal court threw out the request by the defence concerning the director of Sarkozy?s unsuccessful 2012 re-election campaign, Guillaume Lambert, who is one of 14 people in the prosecution?s sights. ??
Lawyers said the attempt to have the case against Lambert dropped was probably the last obstacle to the case going to trial, providing investigating magistrates follow prosecutors? requests to proceed. In the most sensational case against him, Sarkozy was cleared in October 2013 of accepting campaign donations in 2007 from France?s richest woman, L?Oreal heiress Liliane Bettencourt, when she was too frail to know what she was doing. ?

Because the government was keen to sell the Hambantota Harbour that it claimed it was a white elephant, former president Mahinda Rajapaksa said today.
He said people are aware as to how many ships arrive at the Hambantota Port.
?When the two ships seized by the port employees departed another two arrived,? Mr. Rajapaksa said.
He said his government earned a sufficient income from the port during his tenure and that there was not plan to sell it to foreigners.
Mr. Rajapaksa said during his tenure 24 flights arrived weekly at the Mattala Airport but it was reduced to one by the present government and the warehouse given to Paddy Marketing Board to insult the then government.

Every time she tried to walk off, he would sneak up behind her and try and trip her or ambush her. She was very tolerant of him until finally she said enough and turned on him and they engaged in some pretty rough play fighting. (Daily Mail)

KABUL AFP Dec15, 2016 ??
Human rights campaigners Thursday demanded that Britain provide protection for Afghan witnesses who helped jail a fearsome warlord in a landmark trial, after he was unexpectedly returned to the conflict-torn country. ??
Faryadi Sarwar Zardad, infamous for keeping a ?human dog? that savaged victims on his command, was convicted in 2005 and sentenced to 20 years in prison for hostage-taking and torture during the Afghan civil war in the 1990s. ??
He arrived in Kabul on Wednesday after being deported from Britain following his early release from jail. ??
Human Rights Watch voiced concern he would seek revenge from the Afghans who testified against him, mostly via videolink, some of whom were not informed about his release. ??
??In deporting Zardad, and failing to take measures to protect witnesses, the UK has betrayed those who made that conviction possible,? Patricia Gossman, a senior Afghanistan researcher at Human Rights Watch told AFP. ?

US accuses SL investor of money laundering
	
A Sri Lankan investor Rienzi Edwards was charged by the US Justice Department in connection with a fraudulent high-yield investment scheme that resulted in the theft of over $50 million from investors in the United States and around the world, the US attorney's office for the Southern District of New York said in a statement.
Manhattan US Attorney Preet Bharara said: ?Edwards and his co-defendants allegedly concocted and carried out an audacious scam, promising investors exponential returns on investments they claimed were overseen by the New York Federal Reserve and backed by the US government. In reality, it was all a lie; there was no government-backed programme and no plan to invest, only an alleged plan to steal the investors? money.?
According to the allegations contained in the Indictment: From at least June 2013 through August 2016, Rienzi Edwards, Michael Jacobs, Ruby Handler-Jacobs, F.K. Ho, Lawrence Lester and Rachel Gendreau orchestrated and executed a fraudulent high-yield investment programme known as the ?Cities Upliftment Programme,? or CUP, which the defendants falsely told investors was operated by the New York Fed. The scheme was principally designed and operated by Edwards, with the assistance of Jacobs and Handler-Jacobs, and was marketed to investors around the world through brokers, including Ho, Lester, and Gendreau.?
The statement also said that, Michael Jacobs, Handler-Jacobs, Lester and Gendreau were arrested by the US law enforcement authorities. It also said that Edwards and Ho are currently at large. The case is assigned to U.S. District Judge Paul G. Gardephe. Arraignment is scheduled for December 20, 2016, in federal court in Manhattan.
?Edwards, 55, of Sri Lanka, Jacobs, 64, of Albuquerque, New Mexico, and Handler-Jacobs, 64, of Albuquerque, New Mexico are each charged with one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and one count of wire fraud, each of which carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison; one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering and two counts of money laundering, each of which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison; one count of conducting monetary transactions in unlawful funds, which carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison; one count of conspiracy to impersonate employees of the United States, which carries a maximum sentence of five years; one count of impersonating employees of the United States, which carries a maximum sentence of three years; and aggravated identity theft, which carries a maximum sentence of two years in prison.?
Meanwhile, online edition of our sister paper The Sunday Times quoting Rienzie Edwards said that he rejected accusations against him by the US Justice Department of involvement in swindling investors to the tune of over US$50 million.
?In the first place, no one has informed me from the US or the US embassy (here) of these charges. Furthermore I am an investment banker and advises clients (from many parts of the world). I don?t make any investments,? he told Times On-line in a telephone response in Colombo.
Mr. Edwards said he didn?t know the other accused, four of whom have been arrested.
Accordingly, Rienzie had been previously under investigation in Sri Lanka by the Financial Crimes Investigations Division (FCID).

Was the Navy called in to tarnish its image?: MR
	
Former president Mahinda Rajapaksa, yesterday, asked whether the Sri Lanka Navy was asked to intervene in the recent protest at the Hambantota Harbour in order to tarnish the reputation of the Navy.
Referring to the Navy Commander's alleged assault on a journalist who was there to cover the event, Mr. Rajapaksa said the Navy Commander was a skilful officer during the wartime and added that it was the first time that the armed forces had been ordered to intervene to control a protest in recent history according to his knowledge.
Addressing the media at a workshop held in Colombo, the former president also said, ?There is no democracy in the country even though the government speaks highly of democracy. The Sri Lanka Navy was used for the first time to sabotage this protest of workers at the Hambantota Harbour. Such incidents are usually handled by the Police.?
He said he wondered who had instructed the Sri Lanka Navy to intervene to halt the protest.
He said the duties connected to the armed forces could not be altered without the knowledge of the President. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)

The World Bank has pledged assistance worth US $ 1340 million to Sri Lanka which will be on a dual format, Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake announced today.
The Minister said the total sum pledged by the World Bank will comprise US 440 million as development assistance at the rate which could be as low as 2 per cent while it had also received a further US $ 900 million with a higher interest rate in the form of normal assistance.
?Sri Lanka lost development assistance for which the interest rate is much less as its per capita income reached $ 4000 in the recent past. However as a result of negotiations which Sri Lanka had with the donor Sri Lanka getting a mixed assistance," the minister said.
?The World Bank must have surely taken up by the financial discipline which Sri Lanka has shown in the recent past as well," he added assuring that the assistance would be put to good use.

Yahoo suffers world?s biggest hack affecting 1bn users
	
Daily Mail/15 December 2016 ??
Cyber-thieves have stolen personal data from one billion Yahoo customers - the biggest hack in history - and the internet giant took three years to realise. ??
Yahoo has blamed ?state-sponsored? hackers for the August 2013 security breach and the stolen data is believed to include information for over 150,000 US government and military employees. ??
Yahoo claims that its one billion users? card details and bank account details are safe but refused to name the country behind it. ??
The company has been heavily criticised by customers who are furious they didn?t discover the hack in 2013 and failed to tell them until yesterday. ??
In September the company revealed 500 million accounts were breached, which until last night?s revelation was the previous biggest hack in history. ??
