ComBank launches ?Divisaru? savings account for micro businesses
	
A special Savings Account designed to support micro entrepreneurs and promote financial inclusivity to this segment has been launched by the Commercial Bank of Ceylon, Sri Lanka?s largest private bank.
Linked to this new savings account branded ?Divisaru? (Prosperous Life), a micro loan will extend up to 25 times an agreed value of monthly savings, up to a maximum of Rs 125,000, the Bank said.
Intended to support micro enterprises in all sectors including fishing, livestock agriculture and similar pursuits, the Divisaru account can be opened with an initial deposit of just Rs 100, and requires a minimum monthly saving of Rs 1,000 to qualify for a loan.
Account holders will receive a specially designed Passbook and ATM Card to help identify the client segment and provide service, be eligible to open joint accounts, proprietorship or partnership accounts and will receive an interest rate that is higher than that applicable to normal savings accounts, the Bank said.
?It is our intention to organise and build a Micro Entrepreneur customer sector ?that will enable the Bank to focus its attention on the specific needs of this segment, and take a holistic approach in extending services such as savings, credit, leasing, micro insurance and fund transfer facilities,? said S Renganathan, Commercial Bank?s Chief Operating Officer. ?We want to support this segment as much as possible and play a role in its transition from micro to SME and then to the large business category.?
Holders of Divisaru savings accounts will also be eligible to participate in the many workshops and awareness programmes that Commercial Bank conducts periodically in all parts of the country on financial literacy, enterprise development and capacity development for micro entrepreneurs.
The Bank has conducted programmes of this nature for SMEs and micro entrepreneurs in areas such as Narammala, Galle, Monaragala, Wellawaya, Badulla, Passara, Bandarawela, Welimada, Weligama, Koggala, Karapitiya, Matara, Batticaloa, Ampara, Kurunegala, Mannar, Jaffna, Vavuniya and Hingurakgoda in the recent past.
The Bank has established 13 Agriculture and Micro Finance Units (AMFU) to provide dedicated specialised services to the micro sector. These units identify and support people who need financial assistance for agriculture or micro businesses and provide guidance on how to improve those businesses and help resolve difficulties. The units located in Ratnapura, Narammala, Kandy, Anuradhapura, Kilinochchi, Bandarawela, Wellawaya, Hingurakgoda, Galewela, Atchuvely, Vavuniya, Tissamaharama and Kathankudy directly assist nearly 50 Commercial Bank branches with their engagement with micro enterprises.
With assets in excess of Rs 800 billion, Commercial Bank is the only Sri Lankan bank to be ranked among the Top 1000 banks of the world for four consecutive years (2011-2014) and has the highest market capitalisation among Sri Lankan banks. The Bank operates a network of 242 branches and 610 ATMs in Sri Lanka and has won multiple awards as the country?s best bank over several years; been adjudged one of the country?s 10 best corporate citizens by the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce in 2013 and 2014 and been rated the Most Respected Bank in Sri Lanka by LMD for the past 10 years.?

Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake today requested journalists and media institutions to be careful when using the media freedom that prevails under the new government.
He said journalists should verify their facts and figures by speaking to the sources without writing news stories just to fulfill certain agendas.

The minister made these comments at a news conference held at the ministry during a programme launched by the Finance Ministry in collaboration with the Mass Media and the Information Ministry to provide motorbikes and houses to journalists at a reasonable price.

Film on slain Lankan TV journalist banned
	
The Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) in India has refused to certify ?Porkalathil Oru Poo,? a film based on real life story of television journalist, Isaipriya, who was allegedly killed in captivity by the Sri Lankan armed forces in the final stages of the civil war in 2009, on the grounds that the film could strain ?friendly relations with foreign States.?
The film director, K. Ganeshan, who is yet to get a formal letter of rejection from the CBFC, protested the decision. ?What if Sri Lanka is a friendly State? Are we not allowed to criticise even when its armed forces have committed blatant human rights abuses? Even the Tamil Nadu government has passed a unanimous resolution in the Assembly not to consider Sri Lanka as a friendly nation,? he said.
This narrative around the Sri Lankan civil war has been hotly contested, resulting in a number of films being banned by government and others facing protests from various Tamil groups and parties in the State.
While the critically acclaimed documentary ?No Fire Zone?, made by Channel 4, was banned by the Sri Lankan government, Tamil student groups and parties called for a boycott of Santhosh Sivan?s ?Inam? and Hindi film, ?Madras Caf?, on the pretext that they misrepresented the Sri Lankan conflict and tilted the narrative in favour of the Sri Lankan government.
Actor S. Ve. Shekar, the Regional Chairman of CBFC, defended the decision saying that the board merely followed the Cinematograph Act.
?Basically, the act is very clear: certification of a movie cannot be given if it could strain friendly relations with a neighbouring country. We have only followed the rule book. We cannot give a certification based on our whims and fancies,? he says.
?We can argue about what happened during the civil war, but that doesn?t mean that we have to allow a film to be screened. Brutal murders happen in society, but does that mean we can make a film out of it? The director is free to screen the movie outside the country without any cuts,? says Mr. Shekar. (Hindu)

Garbage railway within 2 years
	
	The Colombo Municipality yesterday said that it would continue to dump garbage in Meethotamulla until the completion of its transport project planned for the area.
	Area residents who staged a protest on Sunday demanding that the CMC stops dumping garbage in the area said they were invited to a discussion with the Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe on Friday (May 29).
	The project that is centred around a railway line to transport garbage from Meethotamulla to Puttalam, has been 'expedited' the Colombo Municipality said. Speaking to the Daily Mirror Colombo Mayor A. J. M. Muzzamil informed the project had been approved by the Economic Affairs Ministry last week.
	The project scheduled to be completed within one- and -half to two years will help to evacuate 350- 400 families thus providing more space for the dumping of garbage and also any constructions for the duration of the project.
	?The people will be given alternative housing facilities, rent allowances or compensation. We have not received funds for evacuation from the ministry as yet, but we will begin the evacuation as soon as possible,? Muzzamil said.
	When questioned if garbage would be dumped in the area in the future, the mayor said the municipality would continue dump garbage [at Meethotamulla] for the next one- and- half to two years. ?Garbage will be dumped until the transportation project is completed,? he explained.
	Residents in the area have been tense for the past two years, when a school in the area was forced to shut down due to the stench from the garbage dump.
	Legal action also has been taken by area residents in addition to several protest campaigns demanding the municipality to stop dumping garbage in the area. Several residents have also been evacuated several months ago.
	Residents who wished to remain anonymous said they would take to the streets again if a solution is not provided during the discussion this week. ?They started dumping garbage in three acres and now this has expanded to 18 acres. The people here are legal occupants and they have proper deeds. We didn?t build the houses near the garbage dump, the garbage was dumped near our houses,? the resident said.
	The only expectation from the discussion was a date by when the dumping would finally come to a halt. ?We will take to the streets again if we don?t get a solution,? they said. (Nabeela Hussain)

In a strange turn of events a 30-year-old woman in a complaint to the police has said her 'husband' with whom she had been living for the past eight years was after all a woman and not a man.
The complainant told police that she had been deserted by her paramour after she had a child by him several years before she met the suspect through a marriage proposal published in a newspaper. She said her 'husband' was a mason by profession and after marriage they lived in a rented house in Colombo.
However, she said was unable to pinpoint the pretender's sex though they lived under one roof for more than eight years. She told the police that the suspect was always attired as a male and had never allowed her to touch 'his' body, leave alone having sex with 'him'.
Recently she returned to her village in Weligama with her child and lived at her parental home. It was when she did not receive any money or heard from her 'husband' that she was prompted to complain to the Weligama police. She told the police that on several occasions she had noticed her 'husband? behaving in a suspicious manner. Police referred the pretender to the Weligama District Hospital for a medical examination after which the medical officer had confirmed that the suspect was a woman.
Police said the suspect would be produced in the Matara Magistrate's Court on charges of having cheated an unsuspecting woman by marrying her on the pretext of being a man, making a false declaration to the marriage registrar, possessing a forged National Identity Card and a forged driving licence.(Sunil Dharmabandu Silva)

Pan Asia Bank?s BBB+ rating re-affirmed, outlook stable
	
		 		 
		 
			
The local unit of the world?s leading credit rating agency Standard & Poor?s (S&P), Lanka Rating Agency (LRA) this week re-affirmed its rating on Pan Asia Banking Corporation PLC?s (PABC) long and short-term financial institution ratings at BBB+ and P2 respectively.?
The bank?s rating re-affirmation is mainly supported by its average asset quality, performance, capitalization and liquidity, LRA said releasing its rating review. ?
For the Financial Year Ended (FYE) December 31, 2014 the bank increased its net profits by 265 percent to Rs.415.2 million on the back of a 34 percent loans and receivables growth? the highest among LCBs in 2014.?
Continuing the momentum, the bank posted a net profit of Rs. 177 million, recording an increase of 106 percent year-on-year (yoy) for the quarter ended March 31, 2015 (1Q?15) on the back of a further 10 percent growth in its loan book.?
As at the end of 1Q?15 the bank has a loan book of Rs.69.2 billion and an asset book of Rs.81 billion. ?
Meanwhile for the FYE Dec-2014, the deposits have grown by 20.5 percent to Rs.65 billion and it accounted for 83.5 percent of the funding mix. Most notably the low cost fund base measured through the bank?s current and Savings Account (CASA) base has grown up to 31 percent from 19 percent a year ago. ?
This growth has largely driven by the retail and small and medium enterprise segments but well supported by the growth in the corporate banking unit, particularly by increasing the fee based incomes in a concerted effort to diversify the bank?s income sources. Bank?s fee and commission income has grown by as much as 46 percent yoy to Rs.207.1 million during 1Q?15.?
The bank?s net interest income increased 30.8 percent in FY 2014 while the NIM increased to 3.8 percent from 3.4 percent a year ago. This is at a time when the market?s key interest rates were coming down and the banking sector NIMs were coming under pressure.?
By the end of 1Q?15 NIM has further risen to 4.3 percent.
?It is noted that, with shorter-term deposits re-pricing and the growth in CASA deposits; the reduction in the cost of deposits outweighed the reduction in loan yields leading to an increase in NIM,? LRA stated.?
A notable improvement has been made in the bank?s Return on Equity (RoE), where the RoE has increased up to 9.8 percent by FYE Dec-2014 from 2.9 percent at the beginning of the year. The ratio was further improved to 14.9 percent by end of 1Q?15 demonstrating the bank?s continuous commitment to enhance its shareholder returns.?
Meanwhile during the FY 2014 the bank has improved its asset quality as its gross Non-Performance Loan (NPL) ratio has declined to 5.73 percent from 8.01 percent at the beginning of the year.?
The bank?s liquidity profile as well as capital adequacy levels stood above the regulatory minimums. The statutory liquid asset ratio clocked in at 21.42 percent as at FYE Dec-2014 whereas the regulatory minimum is 20 percent.
Both Tier I and Tier II capital adequacy levels also stood at 8.97 percent and 14.19 percent respectively as at FYE Dec-2014, above the regulatory minimums of 5 percent and 10 percent each. ?
?These capital ratios are deemed to be average in view of the bank?s planned credit expansion strategies,? LRA stated.?
The proposed debenture issue is also assigned with a rating of BBB+, in line with the bank?s long term ratings. ??
In October 2014 Pan Asia Bank issued a 5-year subordinated debentures issue for Rs.3 billion with a rating of BBB which was oversubscribed on the opening day itself. ?

Video: Sarath Silva does another U-turn
	
Former Chief Justice Sarath Silva launching a scathing attack on the present government, saying that it ?was illegal from its inception.? He said that he ?regrets having lit the fire? by opposing President Rajapaksa?s candidacy.?
Silva, in a speech at the Organisation of Professional Associations lashed out at the government listing three aspects in which he believed the government had failed.
?I didn?t expect Maithripala Sirisena to contest the last election. The moment he announced his candidacy I knew this wasn?t moving in the right direction. They sent me a list of meetings at which I was to speak. I put the list into the dustbin,? he said.
This is in sharp contrast to statements given to the media, including Daily Mirror, in which he unreservedly supported the candidacy of Sirisena.
?The only issue I had with President Mahinda Rajapaksa was my opposition to the 18th amendment. I don?t think it is good for a person to contest thrice. That?s why I opposed it. I lit this fire by saying that he couldn?t contest a third time, and I regret it,? he said. ?
He likened the presnt government to a ?pickle which is hard to digest.? ?I must be honest, I reluctantly voted for Maithripala because I didn?t believe that Rajapaksa should have contested thrice. Thereafter I watched the swearing in. The Chief Justice wasn?t present, a tradition that was upheld for a long time.
That?s the first thing. And then suddenly Ranil Wickremesinghe takes oaths as Prime Minister. This is whilst a Prime Minister was still in his seat. Is that good governance? This government was illegal since its inception,? he said.
Silva, detailing his second criticism, said that the manner in which Mohan Peiris, the then sitting Chief Justice was removed reduced the judiciary to a ?comedy.?
?I told Mahinda not to appoint him and instead to appoint a career judicial officer. It was Mohan who gave Mahinda many of the dead ropes. But still he was the sitting Chief Justice. There is a process through which he could be removed specified in the Constitution. Instead, the President just signed a letter while Mohan was outstation and then the previous one was brought in. Then she also resigned. It?s a comedy really. Anyone reading history in a few years time will actually wonder if this was some street show,? he said.
His third criticism, which he dealt with at length, was a complete analysis of the Gazette notification under which the Financial Crimes Investigation Division was appointed.
Pointing out basic spelling errors prior to embarking on his analysis, Silva said that the law did not recognise ?grievous financial crimes?. ?It?s grievous bodily harm. This document is a joke, and it?s Ranil Wickremesinghe?s doing. None of the so-called crimes specified in the gazette are recognised by the penal code. They have also been mandated to investigate large scale projects, how can the Police do that?? he asked.
He said that one of the main areas of concern was the limiting of freedom by the present government. ?Article 13(1) of the Constitution says that you can?t arrest a person unless it?s in a manner prescribed by law. The manner prescribed by law is found in the Criminal Procedure Code. But none of what they are doing is prescribed in the code,? he said.
Whilst continuously attacking Wickremesinghe, Silva said that the very fact that the Magistrate?s Court? was kept open till nine in the night, was evidence of vengeance?.
?This is not good governance. This is vengeance. In which country are magistrates? courts opened at nine o?clock in the night? Is this the good governance that they spoke about?? he asked.
He said that the country was going down a ?dangerous path?, and that he had ?never experienced a pickle like this in the entirety of my life?.
?If I was a judge I would have called the IGP and arrested the IGP. Remanding or arresting a person is not a joke. You have to be very careful when making that decision; this is something that I always told judges when I was on the bench,? he said.?
He further said that the fact that President Rajapaksa had left Temple Trees as soon as his defeat was announced was evidence that he had realised his faults.
?We have to respect the man for that. There was no conspiracy because if there was the CCTV cameras would have shown. None of that happened -- and it?s a lie. He left Temple Trees in a dignified manner; and for that we should respect him. He is a man we can mould -- unlike Wickremesinghe,? he said.
He further said, ?Colombo and the urban middle class will accuse me of everything. That is because they don?t question and instead believe everything Ranil Wickremesinghe and the rest tell them. For those in Colombo and the urban middle class everything they do is right,? he said. (Indika Sri Aravinda and Hafeel Farisz)WATCH

Strikes disrupt services at Govt. hospitals
	
Work in some 1,070 government hospitals countrywide were paralysed today as a result of 48-hour strike launched by All Ceylon Health Services' Union urging that their ten major demands be granted.
	ACHSU President Samantha Koralaearachchi said sixteen hospitals didn?t take part in the trade union action but they too would join in the strike tomorrow.
	The Health Ministry had requested the Sri Lanka Army to deploy personnel to carry out emergency services at the hospitals where the healthcare services had been disrupted.
	The Army said it had deployed 318 personnel at the Lady Ridgeway Hospital for Children, the Colombo South, Avissawella, Badulla, Kosgama, Kurunegala, Elpitiya, Matara and Okkampitiya Hospitals.
	?The Army personnel are not competent to conduct surgical operations and other healthcare services? It is not a good solution. We are aware that the strike action has affected many patients. But, there is no option because the health authorities are not listening to our longstanding concerns,? Mr. Koralaearachchi said.
	He said more than 3,000 healthcare workers at the Colombo National Hospital had not reported to work and as such medical check-ups, work at the Out-Patients Department (OPD), surgical operations and the distribution of meals to the patients had come to a standstill.
	However, Health Services Director General Dr. Palitha Mahipala said the trade union action was unsuccessful because steps had been taken to carry out work in the hospitals without disruption.
	?The Health Ministry's Disaster Management Unit began coordinating the work at the hospitals soon after the Ministry was informed about the countrywide trade union action,? Dr. Mahipala said.
	He said that hospital authorities in Kandy, Gampola, Negambo, Peradeniya, Ampara, Jaffna, Trincomalee, Gampaha, Wathupitiwala and Hambantota had also informed him that their hospitals were functioning as usual.
	Meanwhile, Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne has directed Dr. Mahipala to consider those who did not report to work today as having vacated their posts and to take disciplinary action against them. (Piyumi Fonseka)

Vasu against Gota, Basil contesting
	
While saying he was opposed to Gotabaya Rajapaksa and Basil Rajapaksa contesting the general elections under the UPFA or the SLFP, DLF Leader Vasudeva Nanayakkara said he was helpless if the alliance nominated them.
He said former President Rajapaksa was certain to be the prime minister of the new government to be formed after the elections.
Mr. Nanayakkara said Mr. Rajapaksa would not be disqualified to act as President under the 19th Amendment in the event of President Maithripala Sirisena being unseated through an impeachment motion.
Mr. Rajapaksa would serve for a limited period of time in an acting capacity until parliament finds an MP to serve as executive president for the rest of the term after the ouster of President Sirisena.
He told the media that the attempts made by the constituent partners of the previous UPFA government including the SLFP and the DLF to bring the group supporting Rajapaksa back to the SLFP were extremely successful.
"I have no doubt that the entire SLFP will unite under the SLFP-led by President Maithripala Sirisena by the time the election is due and contest under one flag to win the election and form the next government. During the re-unification of the two factions, about 5% of the SLFP will join the UNP but the UPFA led by the united SLFP is capable of winning the election under the leadership of President Sirisena and Mr. Rajapaksa and emerge victorious to form a strong government," Mr. Nanayakkara said.
He said Mr. Rajapaksa was his own enemy and did not listen to advice and this resulted in his downfall.
"The leftist parties in the UPFA and I opposed the impeachment of former Chief Justice Shirani Bandaranayaka, the introduction of the 18th Amendment to the Constitution and the attack on Muslims at Alutgama by the Bodu Bala Sena goons backed by former Defence Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa. We also wanted Mr. Rajapaksa to bring down the cost of living by reducing prices of essential commodities to give relief to the poor. But unfortunately, he did not listen to us thus leading to his own down fall," Mr. Nanayakkara said.
Responding to a journalist whether it was proper to bring back Rajapaksa as the prime minister after all the negative marks against him, Mr. Nanayakkara said Mr. Rajapaksa was made to do what he could not despite his follies, he had done much for the country including winning the war against terrorism, and holding elections in the Northern Province.
"He is the voice against capitalism. He is the leader of the down trodden and the proletariat. But I admit that there are many things that should have been done by the Rajapaksa regime but had failed. I am totally against bringing back Gotabaya and Basil because they were the main architects of the debacle," he charged.
Commenting on the 20th Amendment, Mr. Nanayakkara said the general elections must be conducted under the new electoral system.
"The DLF wants the new Parliament to be limited to 250 seats comprising 200 under the First-Past-the-Post System and 50 on the national list.
Commenting on his verbal clash with Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe last week, Mr. Nanayakkara said he was provoked by Mr. Wickremesinghe interrupting him when he was on his feet on a Point of Order and added that he had no intention of apologising to Mr. Wickremesinghe over the matter.

We still love 'Appachchi'-Zoysa
	
Claiming he still loved former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, Minister Vijith Vijayamuni De Soysa alleged today that it was the former president's astrologer Sumanadasa and the Rajapaksa family who had tried to destroy ?Appachchi?.
?We still love him. I still have his picture home. We did all the work because we loved him and because we loved the party,? he said.
At a recent meeting in Bibile, the former President told who had gathered there that ?Appachchi didn?t die, I came here to show you that.'
The remark was in response to a post-election statement made by Mr. De Soysa, who effectively pledged his support to President Sirisena following his victory.
?We are the people who worked through the nights to keep 'Appachchi' alive. We were the ones who gave him saline and kept him alive. We didn?t destroy him. It was his family and his astrologer who destroyed him,? Soysa said.
He said he travelled across the country to ensure the victory of the former President.
"Not only in this district but I worked for Mahinda Rajapaksa around the entire country. My son did the same. We were the ones who defended him at all debates, so it was not us who destroyed 'Appachchi', ? he said. (Nayana Tennakoon)
