BBS: Death threats from ISIS
	
	The Bodu Bala Sena (BBS) said today that they would lodge a complaint with the IGP over threats allegedly received from the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) to its General Secretary Ven. Galagoda Aththe Gnanasara Thera.
	BBS CEO Dr. Dilantha Withanage said they were threatened with death over the phone several times and some of them were from Afghanistan.
	We came to know that the slain Sri Lankan ISIS militant had been planning with the ISIS to assassinate Gnanasara Thera. He had earlier informed the ISIS that the Thera should be killed somehow. Even if the Lankan ISIS militant has been killed in Syrian airstrikes, still there are threats to his life, Withanage said.
	According to him, a brother-in-law of the slain ISIS militant had also made a threatened speech towards the BBS organisation.
	He said that the BBS had warned of the danger of Sri Lankans being recruited by ISIS six months ago and that it had become a reality.
	Before the news of the Lankan militant went viral, we had informed the relevant authorities by giving even the telephone numbers of the suspects. But, no action was taken by the authorities and it has led to ISIS growth in Sri Lanka too, he said.(Darshana Sanjeewa)
