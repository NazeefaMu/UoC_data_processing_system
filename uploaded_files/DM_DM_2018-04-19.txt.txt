CHOGM related meeting cancelled due to British Parliament situ
	
President Maithripala Sirisena, who met a group of Sri Lankans in London, said political clashes were not only in Sri Lanka and even British Premier Theresa May had to cancel the meeting with CHOGM leaders to be held at Tuesday noon, owing to the situation in British Parliament.
Some people in our country think political clashes are only in Sri Lanka. British PM Theresa May cancelled the meeting which was scheduled to be held on Tuesday with Heads of Governments because of the situation in Parliament, he said.
He said when he paid a visit to Japan recently with Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva, they witnessed about 2,000 people protesting outside Japanese Prime Ministers office demanding his resignation.
For a moment I thought whether that was a group of people from Sri Lanka had arrived in Japan. When we came out from the Prime Ministers office after having discussions with the Premier, the number of protesters had increased to 5,000. Today, these kinds of political and economic clashes are common in most countries, he said.
President Sirisena reiterated that Sri Lanka has achieved victories in completing development projects to ensure the sustainability of the country.
He said there was no shortcoming in the development projects which are being carried out rapidly.
Meanwhile, he said international relations of Sri Lanka had strengthened in the recent past.
Im not saying this because Im the President. We can win the hearts of everyone maintaining a balanced and a non-aligned foreign policy. Our Government has fortified international relations. Everyone helps us and treat us well now. We should look at the country positively, he said. (Sunil Jayasiri in London)

Fuel price revision after consulting Prez, PM: Arjuna
	
A price revision on fuel will only be carried only after consulting President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, Petroleum Resources Development Minister Arjuna Ranatunga said today.
He said the government had to decide whether the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CEYPETCO) needed to be operated as a public service utility because it had incurred heavy losses over the years.
The minister told CEYPETCO and Ceylon Petroleum Storage Terminal Ltd. (CPSTL) employees when he met them on the first day after the New Year, that the losses incurred by CEYPETCO was an unbearable burden on the Treasury, but none of the successive governments had hitherto decided on operating it as a State welfare service or turning it into a profit-making commercial venture by the government.
It is time to take a strategic decision on CEYPETCO because this extremely vital State venture cannot be operated on losses. CEYPETCOs losses became greater as global oil prices increased steeply in the past few months. However, if fuel prices were to increase in the domestic market, the ultimate decision is in the hands of the President and the Prime Minister, the minister said.
Meanwhile, CEYPETCO Chairman Dhammika Ranatunga said in the past ten months since the new administration took office, many development projects were launched including the construction of a new storage facility for aviation fuel at the BIA and a new tank complex being constructed at the Kolonnawa Fuel Terminal.

15% import duty on Gold creates more room for smuggling: Bandula
	
The governments decision to increase the import tax on Gold by 15% would only create more room for illicit ways to smuggle gold to Sri Lanka, Joint Opposition Member MP Bandula Gunawardana accused.
Addressing a news conference, he stressed that increasing the amount of tax rates on goods like Gold would be of no use because when tax is imposed on such goods, the smugglers tend to import them illegally so that the government would not be able to accumulate its tax revenue as expected.
It was not only the increased tax amount of 15% that the importers have to afford but also the costs like National Building Tax and custom duties are also linked to the tax, MP Gunawardana said.
The selling price of a gold sovereign is recorded as Rs.55,000. As a result of the tax increase, the customers will have to bear an additional Rs.8,000 or more to buy jewellery MP Gunawardana added.
He said increment of tax would not amplify the Govt's revenue but would only create tendency among those who smuggle gold to import them in illegal means. (Sheain Fernandopulle)

Cuba politicians in the countrys National Assembly announced that the vice president had been selected to replace the brother of Fidel Castro, who had taken charge of the country after his brother fell ill in 2011. Fidel Castro, the driving force behind the countrys revolution and who ruled it it with a first that was frequently cast of iron, died in 2016.

On a mission to save Sri Lankas film heritage
	
Fingers pointed at administrators of the National Film Corporation for the loss of the countrys bulk of films
Films are works of cinematic art and they reflect memories and feelings. The creativity in a film reflects the work of a genius. Movies invoke emotions and they relate stories. They create an entire world with a story that grips the audience. But what would happen if the films we watched throughout our lives are not preserved What if the brilliant masterpieces that we witnessed were not preserved for our future generations 
Speaking to the Daily Mirror Gordon de Silva, the countrys first 3D animator and Senior Graphic and Animation artist at Sri Lanka Rupavahini Corporation (SLRC), shared his insight on the preservation of films. A movie buff and a collector of photographic, cinematic and print accessories, his private collection has become a museum for film lovers. He has unveiled the preservation of film evolution of both world and Sri Lankan cinema from the nitrate and cellulose to the present digital era. 
Nitrate and Cellulose era
Sharing his knowledge Gordon said that in 1895, December 28 the Lumiere brothers had released the Arrival of a Train at La India Grand Caf in France marked the beginning of the film industry. Present day cinema is a result of long-term experiments by Lumiere brothers. However, the medium cinema had arrived in Sri Lanka only in 1902, seven years after the commencement of an industry in France. In cinema, there is both art and industry; which aids its wide dispersion, he said. 
Sharing some significant historical facts he said that the people who were involved in cinema had discovered many technical aspects to develop the medium. In the earlier era, Nitrocellulose was used as the first flexible film base, beginning with Eastman Kodak products in August 1889. But Nitrocellulose is a highly flammable compound and it does not need air to keep burning as it produces its own oxygen while ignited. In addition, the smoke created by nitrate film combustion is extremely toxic. Therefore, it is difficult to douse a fire caused by nitrate film, he said. 
Due to this major failure in nitrate films, Cellulose acetate was introduced in 1940 as a safe film base replacing flammable nitrate film. In early Sinhala Cinema, most filmmakers used Cellulose acetate as their film base. Later, film manufactures introduced polyester film base. These three film bases were the major technical changes in world film history, he said. 
Gordon said that film makers and manufactures had started preservation since the Nitrate era due to various damages from chemical reactions on film reels. 
According to Gordon, three chemical changes occur on early film bases. When such a change is discovered on film the preservation begins. Nitrate films and acetate films are subjected to a deterioration process resulting in acid gas release which is called the vinegar syndrome. Another chemical change is mold or fungus. The gelatin binder of a film base is a good nutrient for mold. In these types of film bases, white or brown patches or a lattice-like growth along the edges can be seen. Mold or fungus typically damage the edges of a film. The third chemical change is a crystal base on the film reel. 
Methods of archiving films
Gordon noted that protecting the first copy, the negative or the sound negative of a film is the best form of archiving a film. After screening a film in several cinemas the director or the producer of the film can give it to a film archive which is the second method. Any volunteer who wants to hand over the film to a place where film archiving is done properly can give the film to them, he said. 
Discussing film preservation and restoration, Gordon said that technology has now developed to an extent that a movie will remain in as close to its original form as possible. He said the goal of restoration is to create a durable copy without any significant loss of quality. 
Substandard conditions
Gordon believes that film remains the best archiving and documenting material in the world. Sometimes films would be 10 or 20 years old to be eligible for archiving, but the content never gets old. That is our heritage he said. 
He said that those in the film industry have a responsibility towards maintaining the quality of the film they screen. Cinema owners have to inform of any damages to the relevant private organization or company before handing over the film. When a film, with no damages, is taken out of the laboratory and used, it is essential that a condition report detailing the present quality of the film be submitted, prior to handing over the film, he said. 
Archiving films will not happen by just keeping the film on a wall shelf and in an air conditioned environment. There is a globally accepted method to archive films he said. For example in the early film days there were almost 10 -13 1,000 foot long film reels and we had to store them by using a proper method. Regularly checking of films was required to prevent any chemical changes. This is why film historians, archivists, museums, filmmakers and manufacturers have introduced film preservation as a series of ongoing efforts to rescue decaying film stock and preserve the images which they contain, he added. 
Gordon identifies that during the time Sri Lanka was using black-and-white films people had done various chemical changes to those films. As a result of those chemical changes people had found silver as an end product and they started to destroy black-and-white copies to gain silver, he said. 
He noted that the film restoration is an expensive part. Approximately Rs.2.5 million would have to be allocated to restore a film and in a country like Sri Lanka there was no system to grant such money to restore a film, he said. 
Knowledge sharing at workshop
Recently, the National Film Corporation in association with International Federation of Film Archives (FIAF), the Film Heritage Foundation of India, the Gamini Fonseka Foundation and the Lester James Peiris Foundation had organized a five-day programme on film preservation, restoration, and archiving. 
As a part of this historic attempt, three renowned experts arrived in Sri Lanka to share their knowledge of film restoration and conservation. 
Digital Preservation Consultant, IWM Training and Outreach Coordinator of FIAF, David Walsh, former Manager of Conservation Service at the National Film and Sound Archive of Australia (NFSA), Mick Newnham and Founder Director of Film Heritage Foundation and Director, Producer of Dungarpur Films, Shivendra Singh Dungapur shared their knowledge during the programme. 
In the five-day programme, the experts had conducted workshops and provided theoretical and practical knowledge pertaining to film preservation and restoration. With regard to funding this ambitious project, the Government had allocated Rs.20 million. During the closing ceremony of the programme, the experts and some Sri Lankan officials shared their future plans which are focused on rescuing Sri Lankan films which are in adverse condition. 
Lack of knowledge and efficiency
Damith Fonseka, son of legendary actor Gamini Fonseka, said that his focus is on films that are not embodied in controversy over ownership. Since 1965, no Government has taken any measures to preserve and archive our films. I must say that we have lost most of our films due to the lack of knowledge and inefficiency on the part of the administrators of the National Film Corporation. The people who were appointed for those posts were politically motivated. On the other hand these officials had no place to acquire the necessary knowledge, he said. 
He said that with the change of Government the National Archives and the Film Corporation currently comes under two irrelevant ministries. The National Archive comes under the purview of Education Ministry while the Film Corporation comes under the Public Administration and Management Ministry, he said. 
Fonseka said that the lack of proper coordination between the two ministries has contributed to the sad situation regarding the struggle in preserving films belonging to the early years. 
Plans to establish a laboratory service
National Film Corporation Chairman Sithendra Senaratne said that the visiting experts had to undergo much hardship apart from conducting the program using minimum technical facilities and within a few days. He said that the NFC would establish a laboratory service to restore Sri Lankas film heritage. When we commenced this programme most of us were not aware of how to store a film. We also did not know how to restore it and how to keep it without getting damaged. During a short period, the experts had educated the participants at the workshop, Senaratne said. 
This was a significant moment for Sri Lankans and this would benefit our future generations, he said. 
Hot weather hampering film preservation- Walsh
I found it really distressing to see the state at which the Sri Lankan film heritage has arrived at and this is a real problem for Sri Lankans because time is running out, said David Walsh,a Digital Preservation Consultant of IWM and a Training and Outreach Coordinator of FIAF . 
He said that due to the hot weather condition and humidity prevailing in Sri Lanka, films could not be archived in a normal way. He however said that in European countries it is possible to save films nearly 100-200 years old because those countries experience cold weather conditions. 
Film archiving has two responsibilities; one is preservation and the other one is restoration, David said. He said that restoration is a very complicated and extremely skilled process which is designed to produce the version of a film that could be used as the original copy of a film. 
Sri Lanka has lost 90% of its film heritage- Dungarpur
There are many reasons for restoring films in a country. Shivendra Singh Dungarpur is a man who was inspired and motivated by such nostalgia. Dungarpur is the Founder Director of Film Heritage Foundation and Director, Producer of Dungarpur. He possesses a vast knowledge of film preservation, restoration and archiving. He is an award-winning filmmaker, an archivist, a restorer- who passionately believes in the cause of film preservation and restoration- and the founding director of Film Heritage Foundation - India. He is a key figure in promoting this work in Sri Lanka and shared his insight on the present situation of Sri Lankas film heritage. 
I want to call this work a rescue mission carried out on behalf of Sri Lankans because there is a long way to go. The present situation occurred due to the state of archiving which is in a terrible situation. I think this is a wake-up call and it is a mission which we have to continue and inspire. So much artistic work of directors in Sri Lanka, so many artistes who worked on these films, technicians who worked on these films and the memories gathered with these films....how can we let all this go he queried. 
Dungarpur said that the country has to take the film archiving process forward and this was the beginning of that new moment. You can claim that you had archived nearly 200 films in the National Archives and they are in good condition, but you have lost 90% of your film heritage, he affirmed. He said that with FIAF help Sri Lanka can expect to restore and archive its films. 
Sri Lankan must take film preservation seriously- Newnham
Mick Newnham, former Manager of Conservation service at the National Film and Sound Archive of Australia (NFSA),said that he has had the pleasure of working with people all around the world in preserving their cultural heritage in the form of films and audiovisual materials. 
There is no point in us coming forward and talking about film preservation in Sri Lanka unless Sri Lankans take the issue seriously and do what is needed, Newnham said. 
Its always a joy to work with people who have this burning desire to save their heritage and at the same time there is also sadness because not everything can be saved and the realization of just how much is already being lost, Newnham said.

Only President can win 2020: Duminda
	
The General Secretary of the SLFP Duminda Dissanayake yesterday said that he did not like to respond to the remarks made by SLFP Parliamentarian Dilan Perera on him and UPFA General Secretary Mahinda Amaraweera.
Here is a man who lives on lies and contradictions. It was this same Perera who once said he was to take poison if he could not achieve his political objectives. No one takes him seriously and you also must treat him that way, Minister Dissanayake said.
He said that the issue of 16 former Cabinet Ministers, State and Deputy Ministers joining the SLPP or the Joint Opposition did not arise as long as all of them remained in the SLFP under President Sirisena.
He added he and UPFA General Secretary Mahinda Amaraweera were doing a secretarial function conveying the decisions taken by President Sirisena and SLFP Central Committee.
Both of us have no hand in decision making in our respective parties and we convey the messages to the country, he stressed.
Minister Dissanayake said President Maithripala Sirisena was the one and the only politician who had the capability to win the 2020 Presidential election and therefore, he would be the indisputable Presidential candidate of the SLFP.
He added that all other political parties were in a state of confusion and only the SLFP had already decided on its Presidential candidate and therefore, his victory was already assured.
The SLFPs future lies in achieving victory at the forthcoming Provincial Council Elections, the Presidential Election, the General Election and forming an SLFP Government single-handedly in 2020, he said.
Addressing the media at his office, Minister Dissanayake responding to a journalist said he would never join the UNP but certain SLFP members wanted to push him to the UNP.
I and the late Mr M. D. K. Gunawardane left the SLFP behind Maithripala Sirisena on November 19, 2015, well realizing the threats, challenges and risks but we never resigned from the party of obtained the UNP membership when we contested the August 2015, General Election.
We continue to remain in the SLFP to protect and strengthen President Sirisena and the party. Those who throw brickbats us are those who jump time to time to SLFP from the UNP and to UNP from the SLFP at the right time. It was they who had no policy and lost SLFP membership for years must leave the party, he added.
Responding to demands that all SLFPers and Cabinet Ministers must leave the Unity Government, Minister Dissanayake said it was a betrayal of the hopes given to the people by the Yahapalana Government.
We formed the Yahapalana Government for specific objectives of pruning the Executive Powers of the President, bringing a new Constitution and introducing independent commissions and restoring the rule of law and democracy.
We have a responsibility to fulfil those pledges and that is why we remain the Yahapalana Government, he stressed. (Sandun A Jayasekera)

Parliament was prorogued according to tradition with the proper procedures being followed, Leader of the House Minister Lakshman Kiriella said yesterday.
Mr. Kiriella was addressing journalists in Kandy. Prorogation is a common procedure which is followed to allow MPs and Parliamentary staff to have a break, he explained.
Referring to reports that a majority of SLFPers attached to the unity government were going to cross over to the opposition when the House convenes on May 8, the minister said these were only speculations.
There were a lot of rumours going around even when the no-confidence-motion was brought against Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe saying many UNPers would vote in favour of the motion, however as you know no such thing happened. Therefore, any one can say anything. Lets wait and see what is going to happen, he told journalists. He claimed that a section of the SLFP was willing to work with the UNP.
Asked about the claim that the opposition leaders post was wanted by the joint opposition, the minister said Speaker Jayasuriya will have to give a ruling on it.(Yohan Perera and J A L Jayasinghe)

I call upon everyone present here to join hands with the Commonwealth countries as well as others to bring prosperity with best business practices that will promote social responsibility and ensure social inclusiveness, he said.
President Sirisena said good business practices would be a catalyst for peace and good governance and it should reflect social responsibilities and uphold the rule of law with zero tolerance on corruption.
In the speech themed Delivering Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs): Aligning Businesses, Societies and Governments, President Sirisena said in 2015, the world came together and agreed upon a common vision for a sustainable future in adopting the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.
The Plan of Action we agreed upon is inspiring. Therefore, it is very important that we give life to this ambitious development plan all the way through its successful implementation. In order to eradicate poverty, to address climate change and to build peaceful inclusive societies, it is agreed that key stakeholders must come together, he said.
He said the Sri Lankan Government created a special ministry for sustainable development, integrating the SDGs to the overall national policies.
Our governments Blue-Green economic plan will ensure the full utilization of the ocean and other natural resources of Sri Lanka in an eco-friendly and sustainable manner. Through this economic strategy, Sri Lanka hopes to become a role model for addressing the best practices. The primary responsibility of policy implementation lies with the governments and in many countries, like in Sri Lanka, Heads of State and government are personally leading these efforts. The world today is united in its efforts to create a cleaner, greener and sustainable energy and there is no standard approach for implementing SDGs, and each country decides its own path. However the approach led by our countries should be people-centred, he said. (Sunil Jayasiri reporting from London)

## Title: 16 SLFP members now attempt to secure party secretarys post

16 SLFP members now attempt to secure party secretarys post
	
Following their defection from the Government, the 16 MPs of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) are now engaged in another struggle to secure the party secretarys post and execute their future political plans. 
The SLFP section that remained with the Government is now split down the middle following the defection of these 16 members. Actually, 25 others, who were absent during the vote of no confidence against Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, still remain with the Government. They are ready to forge ahead with the Government under a new programme currently being designed through a committee appointed for the purpose. Agriculture Minister Duminda Dissanayake, who is widely perceived to be acting in connivance with the United National Party (UNP) on political matters, is among the 25 members. 
The 16-member group tries to wrest control of the SLFP Central Committee, and sever political links with the National Unity Government in the formal sense. But, Minister Dissanayake remains an obstacle to it because he, as the General Secretary of the party, holds sway in party matters. As such, this group made representations to President Maithripala Sirisena prior to his departure for London to attend the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM) and requested the General Secretary to be replaced by someone whom they fancy. 
The Joint Opposition, backed by the 16 member SLFP group, is trying to deny two-thirds for the Government. In such an eventuality, the UNP-led Government would be handicapped in enacting come controversial legislations
The President was not averse to the idea. Yet, he remained noncommittal. Be that as it may, when the matter was raised at the last Central Committee meeting, he noted that the majority of the members were not in favour of the current party secretary. These 16 members also demand the removal of Fisheries Minister Mahinda Amaraweera from his post as the secretary to the SLFP-led United Peoples Freedom Alliance (UPFA). 
President cant remain aloof
Unlike during the no confidence motion, it is difficult for the President to remain aloof in this instance. The President wanted to remove the Prime Minister initially. But, his hands were legally tied. So, he could not swear in a new Prime Minister despite wishing to. Therefore, he left it in the hands of those who mooted the idea of a no confidence motion. The motion failed eventually in Parliament. The President attributed the failure to those who brought it. 
In his address to the media after the vote of the motion, the President virtually denied his direct involvement in bringing a no confidence motion against the Prime Minister. Instead, he said it was an idea, brought by the Joint Opposition, in collaboration with a team of SLFPers in the Government and a UNP faction which is distraught with the Prime Minister for being the party leader.
Therein, the President tried to absolve himself from any responsibility. He projected himself as a neutral observer. He avoided incurring any blame regarding this manner. 
However, he has no means to act in the similar fashion when it comes to the removal of the SLFP Secretary and the UPFA Secretary. Here, he cannot be the neutral observer. They are, in fact, his direct appointees. The appointments were made on the eve of the General Elections in August, 2015, ostensibly to guide the outcome of the elections in his favour. 
He has a greater role with regard to the appointment of the secretary to his party. Against this backdrop, the President is under compulsion to take a firm stand whether to remove the two secretaries, rather than remain a neutral observer. 
Despite political manoeuvring and manipulations at the top, the SLFP rank and file have overwhelmingly rallied behind Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) acting under the obvious leadership of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa. 
It is reported that local level organizers of the SLPP protest the accommodation of anyone from the SLFP at this juncture. 
SLPP rank and file against SLFP
The SLFP and the SLPP confronted each other in the run up to the Local Government Polls on February 10, 2018. 
The political leaders of the two parties were harsh on each other. For example, MP Dilan Perera of the SLFP unleashed a scathing attack on the SLPP in the fray. After the elections, the SLFP also worked jointly with the UNP to block the SLPP from forming administration in the local authorities where it did not win absolute majority. 
Nonetheless, the political strategy is now different. The Joint Opposition, backed by the 16 member SLFP group, is trying to deny two-thirds for the Government in Parliament. In such an eventuality, the UNP-led Government would be handicapped in enacting come controversial legislations such as the new Constitution and the Judicature (Amendment) Bill. 
This seems to be the primary objective of the Joint Opposition at the moment. For that purpose, there are attempts being made to lure a few more SLFPers from the Government in addition to the 16-member group. 
According to political sources, most of the SLFPers will quit the Government at the next stage. But, half a dozen of them will join hands with the UNP in view of future elections. Minister Dissanayake is one among them and tipped to team up with the UNP. Besides, the SLFP MPs representing the districts such as Kegalle and Moneragala are also among those planning to throw their weight behind the UNP.

TUs to hold joint May Day rally on May 1: JTU
	
Trade unions will hold their joint May Day rally as usual on May 1, the Joint Trade Union (JTU) said condemning the governments decision to reschedule the rally to May 7.
In a statement, JTU Joint Secretary Anton Marcus said the government had not even discussed postponing the May Day with the National Labour Advisory Council (NLAC) prior to arriving at the decision.
It was back in 1956 that the May Day was declared a public, bank and mercantile holiday. After 62 years, the Yahapalana Government issued a gazette notification declaring this day as a working day. The government says it arrived at this decision to ensure Buddhist religious activities are observed calmly during the Vesak week. However, the Colombo Municipal Council has not granted permission for May Day rallies to be held in public parks on May 1. The government has achieved an indirect ban on all May Day celebrations in Colombo. All these decisions fall in line with a businessman, who joined the national list on the UNP ticket, being appointed as the Acting Minister of Labour and Labour Relations. Nevertheless, we will proceed to hold our joint rally on May 1, he said.
The JTU consists of trade unions attached to the bank, trade, postal, telecommunication, estate staff, teachers, insurance and industrial sectors. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)

Work of British doctor at Karapitiya Hospital suspended
	
The British doctor who was performing heart surgeries at the Karapitiya Teaching Hospital was suspended from work , pending the determination of the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) on his practicing licence, Hospital Director Dr. Jayampathy Senanayake said today.
Dr. Senanayake told the Daily Mirror that the issue had been taken up after several doctors attached to the Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) had stressed on the fact that this British doctor did not have the practicing licence in the United Kingdom (UK) which was needed to be renewed from time to time.
He said the British doctor had assumed work at the Karapitiya Teaching Hospital following an approval letter issued by the SLMC and added that the SLMC had the sole authority to decide on it.
Those doctors attached to the GMOA were threatening to take trade union actions if the authorities would not take any action against this doctor. In UK, doctors should have the registration of its Medical Council and there is also a practicing licence which is needed to be renewed. However, unlike in the UK, only the SLMCs registration is needed to practice as a doctor in Sri Lanka, he said.
Another claim of the GMOA is that the said British doctor was old in age, he added.
He said accordingly, they were waiting for a determination of the SLMC and added that till then the British doctor was suspended from his work for a few days.
Meanwhile, an official of the Health Ministry said this elderly British doctor was performing heart surgeries especially in complicated cases for children.
However, GMOA Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge told the Daily Mirror that when they inquired about the qualifications of this doctor, they had found out that he only had the registration of General Medical Council (GMC) in UK and not practicing rights.
He was deprived of practicing rights in UK in 2015 due to some reason and he had concealed it while he was producing his documents to the SLMC. This 67-year-old British Cardiothoracic surgeon has started working at Karapitiya Teaching Hospital in 2016, he said.
He said the GMOA was waiting for the determination of the inquiry with regard to this matter and added that it was not appropriate to let a doctor who does not have practicing rights in his own country to practice in Sri Lanka. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)
