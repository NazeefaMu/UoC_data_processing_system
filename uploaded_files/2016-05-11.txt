?
During this visit the Big Boss held a powwow with a group of local body members from the province. At this meeting he had reportedly dropped a hint relating to the Cabinet reshuffle in the offing.?
The local politicos at this meeting had gathered from the allusion that there are one or two purohitas facing very serious charges and also there is another purohita who is under continuous fire directed from various quarters.?
Incidentally, a few days prior to the Big Boss? visit to the South he had held a one-on-one meeting with the second in command. These talks also had revolved around the proposed changes in the pack, they say.?
Now all indications are that a purohita engaged in an eternal tug-o-war with the trade unionists, another heading a Ministry located close to the main secretariat and also yet another purohita and a deputy functioning from their offices in Narahenpita area are due to get their walking papers sooner or later, they say.

After all he was up on his feet to join the cheer
	
?
There is a roly-poly purohita holding high office in his political party. ?He was seated next to the Big Boss of the party at their recent May Day rally.
?
The proceedings of the rally were underway and several purohitas one by one presented resolutions to be adopted at the rally. ?Then it was the turn of the chair to call upon those in favour of the resolutions to indicate their approval by raising their hands. The bigwigs on the stage as well as the enthusiastic crowds immediately hailed the resolutions by a show of raised hands. ?However, the senior roly-poly purohita failed to raise his hand to show his approval. Those inquisitive who took a close look-see at the purohita found to their amazement, the poor fellow was fast asleep.?
When the chair announced that the resolutions were duly adopted, the crowds cried out: ?Jayawewa!? The sudden ear-splitting din roused up the purohita from his deep slumber. ?He groggily stood up and shouted: ?Jayawewa!? However, it was obvious that he did not know why he was joining the cheer going up from the crowd.?

?
The stalwarts of the JO group continue to brag that their May Day celebration was a roaring success.?
?
However, there are clear signs that everything about the JO camp is not hunky-dory. For instance, several members from the camp who met in Negombo in secret a few days ahead of the May Day had expressed their displeasure and disgust about the person who has now taken over the task of organizing their camp. Some of them had openly said that they had a half a mind to attend the May Day rally in Galle.
Their collective opinion had been that their political journey would end in disaster if a few individuals who are unpopular among the people were allowed to have their way.?
Two stalwarts of the camp held forth at this powwow while a colleague from Galle was observing a sombre calm, they say.

Private bus owners? said today that they would request for an eight percent to ten percent fares hike by July 1 with a minimum hike of Rs.1
?Due to the increment of the Dollar, the prices of all related products and services to operating buses have gone up,? LPBOA Chairman Gemunu Wijeratne said.
Bus fares are subject to an annual revision based on a special formula taking into account twelve factors including the rate of inflation, the price of a litre of diesel, maintenance costs and the price of tyres and other spare parts.
?But this time the bus fare revision is to be done excluding the price of diesel because the VAT increase has not affected the fuel,? he said.
While addressing the media Mr. Wijeratne said they had officially informed the Transport Ministry, the National Transport Commission and the Finance Ministry in writing about the expected fare increment
He said they also expect to discuss the minimum bus fare for buses in Colombo and suburbs with the relevant authorities.
?The minimum bus fare now is Rs. 9 which we hope to increase by one rupee,? Mr. Wijeratne said.

Panama issue was a private matter: Amarapala
	
Former Megapolis and Western Development Ministry Consultant Vidya Amarapala said today that the Panama Papers exposure was a private matter and that certain people were trying to politicise it.
Mr. Amarapala said he stepped down from the Ministry position, when a print media revealed a list of names as Panama Papers exposure in April 06, 2016, which was later found out not to be true.
?I gave a statement to the FCID on May 03 with regard to the matter and gave all the details and documents I had,? he said.
Mr. Amarapala told a news conference at JHU head office that in a list named as a Panama List released on April 9 midnight in a website had a link to a related list called Offshore Leaks, which was released in 2013 in which his name had been mentioned, providing a ground for mudslinging.
?I had given an explanation to the media on July 14, 2013 regarding the allegation. I resigned as the Director of the Sovereign Capital Corporation, which I had been connected with, in the list. I worked there only as a director and I did not engage in any commercial transaction or entitled to any profit,? he said.
Mr. Amarapala, rejecting the allegations that he had defrauded the money of the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) as its Chairman, said he made the CEB a profitable venture during his tenure and it was those who wanted to defraud the money was making such allegations.
?It was originally estimated that the CEB would incur Rs.40 billion loss by end 2010. But as the Chairman I managed to turn it into a profit of Rs. 5 billion at the end of the year. I left the CEB, when there was a positive balance in the accounts,? he said.
Mr. Amarapala said JVP leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake and National Freedom Front (NFF) Spokesman Mohammed Muzammil had levelled false allegations against him and asked them to correct them within 24 hours and if not corrected, legal action would be taken against them. (Ajith Siriwardana)

The actual cost of the two vehicles of Prime Minister and the cost of repairs of residence and offices of some Ministers were less than what was stated in the supplementary estimates, Minister Harin Fernando said today.
The issue of the estimated was debated extensively during the past few days.
Minister Fernando told a media briefing today that only Rs. 128 million has been spent for the two bullet proof vehicles as pre-tax value, and another Rs. 448 million was for taxes levied on such vehicle imports.
?The Government itself is liable for taxes in the procurement of these vehicles,? he said.
?Premier Wickremesinghe never knew about the plan to procure these vehicles because they have been ordered by the Prime Minister?s Security Division (PMSD) as per State protocol,? he added.
Besides, he said the two vehicles which are currently used by the Prime Minister were more than ten years old and Rs. 500,000 was spent for maintenance of each a month.

Referring to his own Ministry, Fernando said only Rs 2.7 million was spent for the repairs of his official residence though the supplementary estimates said a sum of Rs 4.2 million was to be spent.
?My official residence needed a repair as it was in a dilapidated state, when it was handed over by the Minister who used it earlier,? he said.
The Minister, who responded to statement, which the leader of Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) Anura Kumara Dissanayake said on the purchase of vehicles and cost of repairs, said MP Dissanayake accepted the vehicle permits, which were given to MPs in 2010.

He was a monitoring one who moved in the privileged inner circle of the previous regime. In fact, the Green party and other political parties and groupings backing the yahapalanaya today looked on this worthy as one of the main villains of the previous regime. ?In a strange turnaround, today he has become a powerful character in yahapalanaya.?
However, civil society strands like the Movement for Social Justice shun the man like plague. ?In fact, these outfits had faulted the yahapalanaya bigwigs for entertaining characters like him. ?In response to representations made by the civil society outfits, the authority in the highest echelons had advised the UPFA organizers not to accommodate this turncoat on the stage at the Galle May Day rally.
So the man who had planned to cut a figure on the stage at the Galle May Day rally was turned away when he was about to get on to the stage.?

Udaya calls Govt. black
	
The Joint Opposition today requested the President, the Prime Minister and other Government leaders to set an example by tightening their belts to revive the economy, instead of instructing the people to do so.
Addressing a news conference, MP Udaya Gammanpila said the people were not ready to tighten the belt around their bellies, when the Government leaders loosening theirs.
Referring to the recent supplementary estimate submitted in Parliament, the MP said the Government had allocated Rs. 967 million for the privileges of the MPs.
He said that the Government had increased the VAT, pushing the people to difficulties, as a means of lifting the country from the financial crisis it has engulfed in today.
?Not only that, the Government had also published newspaper advertisements spending millions of rupees. The supplementary estimate, which was given to the MPs, starts from page 47. We have no idea as to what is the content of the first 46 pages and what had been allocated to the MPs. However, Rs. 967 million had been allocated to the MPs for the purchase of houses, vehicles, places of office, foreign tours and as other expenses through this,? he said.
The MP said the late Indian Premier Indira Gandhi refrained from having dinner during a famine struck in 1972 setting a precedent. This move, he said helped increase the self confidence of the people to face the famine.
Mr. Gammanpila said in England, during the financial crisis of 2010, the Government introduced a policy called ?Simple State Service? curtailing extra expenses.
?Some of the MPs even used public transport system to save fuel. All the Ministers and even the Prime Minister travelled only in economic class, when flying. This is how the Governments should act when there are crisis. Then people will follow them spontaneously,? he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)
