HR problems reported during last year-US
	
The United States said that major human rights problems were reported in Sri Lanka during 2015, including harassment of civil society activists, journalists, and persons viewed as sympathizers of the banned terrorist group the LTTE as well as arbitrary arrest and detention, torture, rape, and other forms of sexual and gender-based violence committed by police and security forces.
According to the -2015 Country Reports on Human Rights Practices-, the US stated, Other serious human rights problems included severe prison overcrowding and lack of due process.
Presenting the report US Assistant Secretary, Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor Tom Malinowski said In Sri Lanka, well be encouraging reconciliation and justice in keeping with the joint resolution its government co-sponsored with us at the UN Human Rights Council.

Neglect of the rights of internally displaced persons (IDPs) remained a problem, as was physical and sexual abuse of women and children and trafficking in persons, the report said adding that discrimination against persons based on sexual orientation continued. Limits on workers rights and child labor also remained problems.
It also said that widespread impunity continued for the crimes committed during the armed conflict and other crimes committed following the end of the conflict, particularly for cases of torture, sexual violence, corruption, and human rights abuses.
The government arrested and detained a number of military, police, and other officials implicated in old and new cases that included the killing of parliamentarians and the abduction and suspected killings of journalists and private citizens, the report said.
The report also said that unlike in the previous year, there were no substantiated reports of extrajudicial killings, although the use of force against civilians by government officials, while increasingly rare, remained a problem. The government arrested several members of the armed services and political class suspected in unsolved cases, some more than a decade old.
The law prohibits arbitrary arrest and detention, but such incidents occurred although at a decreased rate relative to 2014. Civil society groups and human rights activists reported incidents of persons arrested and detained on unsubstantiated charges.
Commenting on the media freedom the US said that "Independent media were generally active and expressed a wide variety of views without restriction."
Journalists at the provincial level complained of routine harassment by local officials, including pressure to avoid negative stories. They expressed a need for robust right-to-information legislation. Owners of many media institutions had ties to top political leaders, with concomitant influence over editorial decisions. Nevertheless, in general most outlets and reporters covered the news freely without overt restrictions.
Politicians sometimes used or threatened libel suits against journalists to intimidate them against publishing negative coverage, the report said.
The US said that the government did not seek to censor the media for publishing content critical of government actions. Some in the media practiced self-censorship especially during the first quarter of the year as they adjusted to a freer public information environment under the Siresena government.

## Title: SL's public holidays and the economy

SL's public holidays and the economy
	
After years of civil conflict, Sri Lanka takes the needs of its multiethnic population very seriously, with a very pleasant side-effect: 25 national public holidays a year.
It's one of the highest national public holiday counts in Asia, far outstripping Singapore's 13 days, Japan's 17 days and even Indonesia and Thailand's relatively generous 19 and 20 days respectively. For Americans, who survive on a measly nine mandated days off a year, as well as Australians on just 10, 25 would be a dream.
Sri Lankans can thank their country's many recognized religions for the days-off bonanza.
Up to 70 percent of Sri Lankans are Buddhists, while the rest of the population identify as Hindu, Muslim, Catholic, Christian or "other," according to an official census in 2012. As a result, most public holidays are for Buddhist holiday days, but there are also holidays for important Hindu, Christian and Muslim religious events.
The full moon day of every lunar month is known in Sri Lanka as Poya day, a Buddhist day of observance. There are 12 Poya public holidays alone in 2016, which generally sees residents wind down and the sale of alcoholic beverages, meats and fish banned.
Lolitha Abesinghe, managing director of investment advisory firm Opportunity Sri Lanka, told CNBC that the high number of religious public holidays was a way to "extend the same level of respect to a cosmopolitan mix of population...to maintain the peace, harmony and coexistence in the country."
The war ate up more than $200 billion in government spending over the years, according to an estimate by the Asia Economic Institute, as well as damaging economic development - an effect from which Sri Lanka is still recovering.
And while the high number of national holidays are a sign of religious equality, some businesses complain that they're unfavorable for the economy.
People working on a public holiday are entitled to double the normal rate of wages, according to Sri Lanka's Shop and Office Employees Act.
"Business entities in Sri Lanka have worked around the higher number of holidays to continue generating a good level of productivity," Abesinghe said.
He added that the public holidays helped boost the revenue potential of hotels, shopping malls and other entertainment-related industries.
But Lahiru Pathmalal, chief executive of Takas, a Sri Lanka-based internet e-commerce startup, is less positive.
"Public holidays may lead to better off-time but in terms of productivity and consumer behaviours there's an impact," he said.
"I dread seeing public holidays turn into long weekends," said Pathmalal, adding that this often led to a fall in revenue for his company.
Pathmalal told CNBC that he believed Sri Lanka needed to cut down on its generous public holiday calendar, because the holidays, which were originally meant for religious purposes, were no long observed as such by most people.(CNBC)
