Authorities had not made any attempt to resolve Uni. non-academic strike: UTAJU
	
The Higher Education Ministry(HEM) and the University Grants Commission (UGC) had not made any substantial attempt to resolve month long non-academic strike leading the entire university system in the country to a standstill, University Teachers? Association of Jayewardenepura University (UTAJU) said.
In a statement issued by the union had expressed its strong displeasure towards the related authorities for its inefficiency towards resolving the matter.
Union President Dr. Naleen Ganegoda said that the strike had severely affected regular academic and research activities at all universities.
?Obviously, this situation in universities has been brought about by certain nonsensical agreements, either the Ministry of Higher Education, the Ministry of Finance or the University Grants Commission has haphazardly made with non-academic unions from time to time.
?Examples include (a) an agreement to pay a compensatory allowance for the non-academic staff at a time when the academic staff received an increase in their allowances, and (b) a written assurance given to non-academic unions that if any increase is made in salaries or allowances in the university system in the future, it requires a common consensus among different parties.
?We strongly object to the fact that these agreements had been made in the absence of any union representation on the part of the university academics.
?Even though we respect the right any trade union has to fight for their demands, our membership strongly oppose the use of the academic allowance as a benchmark to justify their demands. This is because the academic allowance was introduced for academics in the university system to address several issues associated with recruiting and retaining individuals with higher academic and professional qualifications.
?As a solution to these salary-related issues that can emerge in the university system from time to time, we feel that a ?special category? should be established for university academics. Despite the fact that many discussions have taken place in this regard both at trade union levels and with the government, unfortunately, the establishment of a special category has not been materialized yet. We would like to remind the government and our fellow sister unions that it is high time we act together to make this a reality.? It added. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

BRI, a golden opportunity for SL's development: Chinese Envoy
	
China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI)is a golden opportunity for the development of Sri Lanka?s economy and the improvement of its people's livelihood, Chinese Ambassador Cheng Xueyuan said.
He said the Belt and Road Initiative was highly compatible with Sri Lanka's national development strategy.
?Logically, Sri Lanka became one of the first countries to openly support the BRI, since it is highly compatible with Sri Lanka's national development strategy. I am glad to learn that President Maithripala Sirisena, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, and other political leaders of Sri Lanka all expressed their willingness to actively participate in jointly building the BRI and make full use of Sri Lanka's superior geographical position to build itself as the Hub of Indian Ocean,? the Ambassador said in a statement.
He said the Colombo Port City together with Hambantota Port and Industrial Zone are like two powerful engines for Sri Lankan economy to take-off.
?With the continuous development of these mega-projects, Sino-SL economic and trade cooperation is expected to start a new chapter. The Port City has already attracted the great attention of a large number of investors from China, the US and Europe. With the blue waters and pink sunset of the Indian Ocean, the under-construction port city site has become the most spectacular and beautiful scenery in Colombo,? he said.
The Ambassador said Hambantota will play an important role for the development of the southern region of Sri Lanka and China has undertaken the construction of the Hambantota Port at the request of the Sri Lankan government.
?In addition, both sides have also agreed to establish an Industrial Park in Hambantota, to fully explore the huge advantages of the port. At present, the negotiations of large-scale projects such as LNG power stations, petroleum refinery, cement, iron and steel manufacture are accelerating, which are expected to bring drastic changes to the local economy and people's livelihood and surely become another new engine for Sri Lanka's development,? he said.

Former Brazilian President Lula starts prison sentence
	
?
Rio de Janeiro (Hindustan Times), Apr 08, 2018 - Former Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva was spending his first night in jail, a stunning fall from grace for a man who rose from nothing to lead Latin America?s largest nation and later became engulfed in corruption allegations.? ?
Foreshadowing possible clashes in the weeks to come, police shot rubber bullets and sprayed tear gas late Saturday at supporters waiting for da Silva as he landed in a police helicopter in the southern city of Curitiba, where he will serve his 12-year sentence for money laundering?
and corruption.? ?
Just a few hours before that, da Silva had to have guards push their way out of a metal workers union in a Sao Paulo suburb so he could turn himself in to police; supporters were trying to keep him from going? into custody.? ?
Speaking to thousands of supporters at the union that was the spiritual birthplace of da Silva?s rise to prominence, the former leader said would turn himself in so as to continue fighting a corruption conviction that he said amounted to a way for enemies to make sure he doesn?t run ? and possibly win ? re-election in October.? ?
When he first tried to leave the metal workers union headquarters, however, dozens of supporters blocked a gate where a car carrying da Silva was trying to exit.? ?
Dramatic scenes throughout the day underscored the drama that has rapt a nation deeply divided on da Silva?s legacy and whether he is guilty of corruption. The latest developments began when the Supreme Federal Tribunal, the country?s top court, ruled against his petition on Thursday to remain free while he continued to appeal his conviction.? ?

Most Ven. Ahangama Ananda Adhikarana Nayaka Thera passes away
	
Cremation today at Henry Pedris Park, Colombo 05
The Most Venerable Ahangama Ananda Nayaka Thera, the Chief Incumbent of Sri Vijayaramaya, Wellawatte, passed away on Friday, April 6, 2018.
His cremation will take place today (April 9) at Henry Pedris Park, Colombo 05.
The Venerable Ananda Thera was born in 1932 to a respectable Buddhist family in Ahangama, Galle. His father was Hevapathiranage Arnolis Dikkumbura and mother was Dikkkumburage Aranolihami, who had passed away when the Venerable Thera was still at the very tender age of four.
He entered the monastic life in 1940 under the guidance of Ahangama Sri Prajnaloka Maha Thera, founder of Sri Vijayaramaya, Wellawatte.
The latter was an erudite monk known throughout the country as an oriental scholar and preacher of the Dhamma. Ananda Thera had his primary monastic education at the feet of his teacher, and subsequently, he had his further studies at Vidyodaya Pirivena, Maligakanda, one of the two greatest monastic education centres of the last century.
After completing his basic education, the Venerable Thera had to undertake, along with his ?monastic elder brother? the most Venerable Ahangama Dhammarama Thera, who is heading the Los Angeles Buddhist Vihara since 1979, the responsibility of running the temple because their teacher, the Venerable Sri Prajnaloka Maha Thera, passed away in 1956, at a relatively young age.
While the Venerable Dhammarama was active in educational and social services outside the monastery, Venerable Ananda had to attend to the religious needs of the Dayaks of the monastery and to the activities of the Sangha of his own Nikaya and those belonging to various other Nikayas, who lived in the area. In this manner, from his early adult life, the Venerable Thera developed an illustrous career of social and sasana service.
?
"While the Venerable Dhammarama was active in educational and social services outside the monastery, Venerable Ananda had to attend to the religious needs of the Dayaks of the monastery and to the activities of the Sangha of his own Nikaya and those belonging to various other nikayas, who lived in the surrounding area."
By the time he passed away at the ripe age of 86 the Venerable Thera was one of the leading members of the Sangha who has dedicated his life to social service.
In his multi-faceted social service activities, the Venerable Thera was known for his ?Gilana Upastana? or taking care of the patients of the hospitals both in and out of Colombo.
With his pleasant personality and excellent organizing skills, the Venerable Thera was able to enlist the support of a large number of well-wishers for his ?hospital service? activities.
He supported in a similar manner the soldiers who had lost their limbs by providing them with artificial limbs, and he helped many helpless families of soldiers who sacrificed their lives in the course of the recent terrorist war.
?
"By the time he passed away at the ripe age of 86 the Venerable Thera was one of the leading members of the Sangha who has dedicated his life to social service"
Another form of social welfare activity in which the Venerable Thera showed much interest is to help expecting mothers with medicine and other requisites. This he did from time to time, and death prevented him from taking part in another similar event which has been organized by him to take place just before the Sinhala New Year of this year. One of the many acts of kindness organized by him and one that attracted much social attention is ?Abhaya-dana? for animals under which he rescued many hundreds of cattle from slaughterhouses around Colombo and in many parts of the country. With generous support from many similar minded good people, the Thera practised this great act of kindness towards animals displaying that ?metta? knows no bounds.
?In addition, he was the advisor to ?Meth Saviya?, a social service organization by means of which he was able to render educational and spiritual service to the society at large. He served also as the president of Munidasa Cumaratunga Foundation which was dedicated to perpetuating the scholarly and linguistic legacy of the great savant, Munidasa Cumaratunga. The Venerable Thera was a respected elder among the Maha Sangha in general, and in particular, he is a senior member of the monks belonging to the Dharmaraksitavamsa Amarapura Maha Nikaya, the current head of which is the Most Venerable Pandit Tirikunamale Ananda Mahanayaka Thera, the Viharadhipati of Siri Vajiraramaya. The Venerable Thera functioned as the head of judiciary board of his Nikaya.
With the demise of the Venerable Thera, the Buddha Sasana loses another of its great members who lived a life dedicated to the service of the Sasana and the society. May the Venerable Ahangama Ananda Maha Thera attain the Supreme Bliss of Nirvana!

PM made deal with TNA to defeat no-faith motion: SLPP
	
The Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) today claimed that Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe had made a deal with the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) to get its support to defeat the no-confidence motion against him.
It said TNA MP Selvam Adaikalanathan has revealed that the two factions had agreed to 10 conditions if the TNA was to vote against the no-confidence motion.
SLPP Chairman G.L. Peiris said according to the agreement 650 acres of land occupied by the armed forces in the North was to be released to their owners.
?Another condition of the agreement is to appoint officers of Tamil origin as district secretaries in the North and East. This will lead to grave repercussions in the state sector. The Constitution allows any citizen, regardless of their ethnicity, to settle anywhere in the country and to work anywhere,? he told a news briefing.
Prof. Peiris said the TNA?s stance during the no-confidence motion debate proved it was another constituent of the government.
?The leadership of the Opposition should be given to someone named by the former president and MP Mahinda Rajapaksa from the joint opposition,? he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Police should?ve provided another location to land: Speaker?s Media
	
Responding?to the reports of Speaker?s helicopter obstructing Avurudu Celebrations?organised by the Matale International School at the Edward Silva Grounds, Speaker Karu Jayasuriya?s Media Division today said the police should have provided?another location to land the helicopter?if the ground was already booked.
In a statement, the Media Division said the Speaker arrived in Matale in Helicopter on Saturday to declare open the Weera Madugalle statute as the Chief Guest.
?The decision where the helicopter should be landed, should be taken by the police in the area.

However, upon witnessing that the ground had been decorated for a function, the Speaker was informed that an Avurudu Festival has been scheduled to be held at 1 pm. Therefore, Speaker instructed the organisers to speed up the opening of the Madugalle Statute and came back to Colombo at 11.45 am to allow the Avurudu Festival to kick off,? it said.
However, it said Speaker expressed?his regret if any inconvenience was caused to the Matale International School?s students, parents and the teachers because of the landing of the helicopter at the Edward Silva Grounds.

Power hungry politicians still betraying country for money: Speaker
	
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya said that just as in the past when there were certain individuals that betrayed the nation for money, it was a matter for concern to see that even today there are power-hungry politicians who are willing to betray the country in their quest for power.
He also said, ?That is why now more than ever we are calling for national unity. When we gained independence in 1948, Sri Lanka and Japan were on an equal footing economy wise. Today, however, Japan is so advanced while we are lagging behind. This is because they are united as a nation,? the Speaker emphasised.
His observations came during a speech given by him at the 199th Commemoration Ceremony and the unveiling of the Statue of Madugalle Nilame in Matale.
Maduglle Nilame was called unpatriotic and a traitor by British invaders. However, taking into account the brave leadership to Uva-Wellassa independence struggle in 1817 - 1818 President Maithripala Sirisena had taken steps recently to declare him and those who fought alongside him in the struggle, patriots.
During the event, the unveiling of the statue of the brave patriot Madugalle Nilame took place in front of the Matale library where floral tributes were also placed at the foot of the statue. Thereafter a website describing the feats of Madugalle Nilame was also launched followed by a lecture was delivered Professor Viraj Balasuriya of the University of Visual and Performing Arts.
Deputy Minister of Plantation Industries, Laxman Wasantha Perera was also in attendance. (M.W.Somaratne and Ravindra Viraj Abayasiri)

## Title: Why Donald Trump should buy a Harley Davidson

Why Donald Trump should buy a Harley Davidson
	
Is US President Donald Trump, the unlikely destroyer of Harley Davidson, the ?muscle? motorcycle which exemplified an alluringly visceral, rather than cerebral, Americana for so?
many decades?
A news report in the Guardian UK that the European Union would consider tit-for-tat high tariffs on Harley imports, adding to the woes of a company, whose fortunes have declined alarmingly in recent years, makes one wonder if Trump would finally manage what the entire Japanese motorcycle industry could not ? to knock Harley Davidson out of the motorcycle big boys market.
The Japanese nearly succeeded in the 1970s when their sleek cruisers, free of vibration and oil stains began winning over beefy American buyers. But Ronald Reagan checked the Japanese invasion with high tariffs, thus saving Harley Davidson.
The company has undergone many crises in its 113-year long life and may survive this one too. The Guardian story was accompanied with two photographs ? one from the movie Easy Rider, showing Peter Fonda and Dennis Hopper riding two customized Harleys, and the other showing Elvis Presley sitting on a Harley in the 1967 movie Clambake.
I haven?t seen Clambake, but I have seen Easy Rider. Before that, however, a few words about the bikes.
?
"The crown princes of our previous regime chose more revvy European and Japanese superbikes for night racing along the streets of Colombo, not the Harley Davidson, a machine that can break the ankle of an 80 or 90 kg rider if he puts it down carelessly"
Harley Davidson is a name that millions of motorcyclists all over the world aspire to. Most of them will never ride one. It is the same thing as fans hankering after their movie or pop idols ? Harley has star status in the world of motorcycles, and most of the faithful are males since it is the manliest motorcycle you can think of.?
Nowadays, more and more women ride Harley Davidsons, but that is mostly in the West. It still remains very much a man?s bike; not because women can?t manage to ride them safely or do the frequent tappet adjustments or even get into trouble with the Police, if the occasion arises.
It is because of that enduring image of Harley Davidson with a certain type of male rider ? beefy, tattooed and grim with a beard, a colourful outlaw, whose only saving grace is that romantic association with a lot of gleaming chrome and grease stains.
Harley had a life in Sri Lanka in colonial times, along with Indian, the vanished giant. There were HD legends, not all of them pleasant ones, such as the story that a tea planter went off the road at Kadugannawa because he could not safely negotiate the (then) notorious elbow bend. But the Harley was always a rich man?s bike and got rarer after the Independence.
In any case, as imports of all motorcycles over 350cc was banned in the 1980s (Only the Government being in that privileged position) Harley Davidson became the stuff of dreams.
The crown princes of our previous regime chose more revvy European and Japanese superbikes for night racing along the streets of Colombo, not the Harley Davidson, a machine that can break the ankle of an 80 or 90 kg rider if he puts it down carelessly.
In the country of their birth, Harleys had a certain image problem till the 1980s at least. There were Harley motorcycle gangs and they would descend on a town somewhere in their hundreds, sometimes leading to confrontations with the local sheriffs and the Police. A British motorcycle writer said in the 70s that the US had the least regard for motorcyclists (regardless of what they rode) compared to Western Europe.
?
?
This may have changed since then, as more and more professionals such as doctors and the American corporate class found it fashionable to ride flashy big motorcycles from the 1990s on. But the association of the Harley Davidson with the bearded, tattooed motorcycle rider is an indelible one, and lingers on, despite the fact that Harleys are standard issue to American Police forces, too.
There is the mistaken impression that the 1969 movie Easy Rider was about Harley Davidsons. It is not. Witten by Peter Fonda, Dennis Hopper and Terry Southern, produced by Peter Fonda and directed by Dennis Hopper, the film became a cult classic and much more than just another motorcycle movie. Nothing like it has been produced anywhere since then.
The soundtrack included songs such as ?The Pusher? and ?Born to be Wild? by Steppenwolf, and the song ?Don?t Bogart Me? by the Fraternity of Man has been described as a marijuana-smoking behaviour guide?.
The 1960s was the decade of drug experimenting, free love and hippie lifestyle in the West (when the Beatles? song Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds came out in 1967, people speculated that the initials stood for LSD).
As the film starts, Peter Fonda and Denis Hopper (Wyatt and Billy) are seen arriving at a ramshackle inn (ironically named La Contenta Bar) near the Mexican border in two cheap Japanese dirt bikes. They have come to buy heroin, which they sell to a sleek type, who comes in a Rolls Royce back in the US.
?
"It is because of that enduring image of Harley Davidson with a certain type of male rider ? beefy, tattooed and grim with a beard, a colourful outlaw, whose only saving grace is that romantic association with a lot of gleaming chrome and grease stains"
That is how they find the money to get their dream bikes ? two customized Harley cruisers, on which they intend to travel to the Mardi Gras festival in New Orleans.
Actually, you don?t see a Harley badge on either; it is the customary engine rumble that gives them away. And these two don?t fit that stereotype image of muscle-bound Harley riders.
Neither are they regular drug pushers. Tall and lean, they are a different kind of dropout ? non-violent, soft-spoken and with wistful eyes full of self-irony, longing and a yearning for life which stretches beyond their taut frames.
As the two hit the open road in their shiny new bikes, tanks festooned with painted US flags (with marijuana hidden inside), there is the song ?The Pusher? by Steppenwolf:
?You know I smoke a lot of grass/oh lord, I pop a lot of pills.? Soon, the wailing electric guitar, measured beat and lugubrious tone give way to the funky rhythms of ?Born To Be Wild,? also by Steppenwolf.
Not being able to afford a new musical soundtrack, the director and producer opted to use already known pop hits by a bewildering number of artists -? Steppenwolf, the Jimi Hendrix Experience, The Byrds and the Fraternity of Man.
There is even a credit to Bob Dylan. It?s doubtful if Harley executives would want anything to do with a film which had songs such as these, and it?s unlikely that they offered any sponsorship to the filmmakers.
?
"Harley Davidson is a name that millions of motorcyclists all over the world aspire to. Most of them will never ride one. It is the same thing as fans hankering after their movie or pop idols ? Harley has star status in the world of motorcycles, and most of the faithful are males since it is the manliest motorcycle you can think of"
On the way, the duo meet a nameless hitchhiker, who takes them to a Hippie Commune. Back on the road afterwards, they are joined by Jack Nicholson, an alcoholic small-town lawyer who relishes the freedom of the open road.
The film was low-budget and became a box office hit in 1969. It shows a United States of contrasts. While apolitical, it speaks for the marginal, from Wyatt and Billy and the Hippies to the black cotton pickers who stare in glum wonder at the two riders as they ride through the deep south, little realizing that they themselves are as hated as the blacks, if not more, by the ultra-conservative rednecks there. The conflicting worlds finally lead to tragedy.
Ironically, when Easy Rider became a box office hit, many Americans would have reacted in disbelief if someone predicted the Presidency of Donald Trump.?
And yet, the essence of what made Trump got elected is in the film. Now, the final irony would be if Trump, the redneck president would go down in history as the man who dug the grave of Harley Davidson, the red neck All-American motorcycle.
