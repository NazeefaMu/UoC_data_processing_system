Ceylinco Life Managing Director R. Renganathan (3rd left) accompanied by Directors Thushara Ranasinghe, Palitha Jayawardena and Devaan Cooray open the new building
Ceylinco Life has opened its new branch building in Trincomalee, custom-built to a new eco-friendly model adopted by the life insurance leader for branches being constructed on company-owned land.
The new four-storey building of approximately 11,000 square feet stands on 62.65 perches land at Kandy Road, Trincomalee. It accommodates seven branches and one customer service section and has a 24-vehicle car park for customers, the company said.
The building with a floor area of approximately 11,000 square feet is designed to use natural light on all floors, uses natural ventilation in common areas, lobbies and its lunch room, is solar powered, has a rainwater harvesting facility and is equipped with energy-efficient air-conditioning, making it one of the most eco-friendly offices of its size in the Eastern Province capital.
The building also has-elevators, a conference hall that can accommodate 100 people, and a roof-top recreational area for the use of staff.
The new office building was ceremonially declared open by Ceylinco Life Managing Director/CEO R. Renganathan on 14th November, one year after he laid the foundation stone for it.
A similar branch building designed to use renewable energy and water is nearing completion at Wennappuwa, while construction of another branch at Horana will begin in late November, the company said.
In August this year, Ceylinco Life opened an eco-friendly, four-storey branch office on company owned land in Bandarawela. The company already owns the buildings housing its offices in Anuradhapura, Jaffna, Batticaloa, Kandy, Kalutara, Kurunegala, Gampaha, Galle, Matara, Tissamaharama, Negombo, Ratnapura, Kotahena and Mount Lavinia, in addition to Trincomalee.

Customs seize counterfeit fags worth Rs.355mn
	
	The largest single detection of illicit cigarette consignment in history estimated to be over Rs.355 million in value was seized by the Customs Post Clearance and Audit Division on January 9, 2015, the day following the Presidential Elections.
	The contraband had arrived in the country from Dubai on January 9, the day following the Presidential Elections was held.
	The consignment had arrived in a 40-foot container declared as chest freezers.
	The container was opened and displayed to the media at the Customs unit at Grayline II Container Terminal at Grandpass this morning.
	Customs Spokesman Director Leslie Gamini said that it was the first time in the history that an illicit cigarette consignment packed in a 40-foot container was detected by the Customs.
	Previously two 20-foot containers had been seized in single detection few years ago, which held the record of the highest number of sticks, he said.
	Customs sleuths found 10, 770, 000 (Ten million seven hundred and seventy thousand) sticks of cigarettes belonging to a brand called Royal, manufactured in Dubai. The sticks were neatly packed in 53, 850 cartons.
	The street value of the consignment had been estimated at Rs. 355, 410, 000 (Three hundred and fifty five million four hundred and ten thousand) and the evaded payment of taxes to the government was at Rs.300 million, he said.
	The consignment had been sent to a person addressed in Nugegoda which was later found to be false. A private shipping agent had couriered the container and out of suspicion the Customs PCAD officials held it until a consignee would turn up.
	A senior Customs official disclosed that it is highly suspicious that the cigarette consignment arrived on the day following the Presidential Election and had not been claimed by any for almost 10 months may indicate the incapability of certain influential persons with the unexpected transfer of power.
	Further investigations are being carried out by Customs Superintendent Prabath Rathnayake, Deputy Superintendents Samantha Rajapakse, Chula Wijesundera, N S Kumanayake, Anil Jayakody, Hasantha Guruge, Nishantha Jayasinghe and W L C Thilakasiri on the instructions of Deputy Director of Customs PCAD C Perinpanayagam and Kithsiri Fernando.
	The contraband will be confiscated and destroyed in due course, the sources said. (Chaturanga Pradeep and Kurulu Koojana Kariyakarawana)

GMOA wants probe into Ven. Sobitha Thera's death
	
The Government Medical Officers? Association (GMOA) today requested President Maithripala Sirisena to launch a comprehensive, impartial, and swift investigation into the death of the Chief Incumbent of the Kotte Sri Naga Viharaya Ven. Maduluwawe Sobitha Thera.
Ven. Sobitha Thera who was also the convener of the National Movement for a Free and Just Society passed away at the Mount Elizabeth Hospital in Singapore on November 8.
However, the GMOA said it was difficult to come to a conclusion regarding the cause of the death since several suspicious circumstances had arisen how the prelate was treated in the country before he was flown to Singapore.
?Ven. Maduluwawe Sobitha Thera had been admitted to a private hospital in Colombo when he previously fell ill. He was keeping well after he was discharged from that hospital. He was not having a critical condition earlier. But, days after he had again fallen ill and had been admitted to another private hospital.
Unexpectedly, two germs that are possible to infect within a hospital environment have been discovered in the tissues of Thera?s lungs during investigations carried out by Asiri Hospitals Laboratory,? Dr. Naveen de Soyza, the Spokesman of GMOA said.
He said though some say the prelate had passed away as his illness worsened, the GMOA was of the view that something suspicious could have happened within the system where Sobitha Thera was treated.
Dr. Soyza urged the President to appoint a committee to probe the cause of the Prelate?s death.
?The committee should find how and where the germs, that were found in Sobitha Thera?s body, infected by questioning hospital staffs,? he said.
Meanwhile, Secretary of GMOA, Dr. Nalinda Herath said they heavily condemned the Chairman of the Neville Fernando Teaching Hospital in Malabe Dr. Neville Fernando?s move to sue the Chairman of the Sri Lanka Medical Council Professor Carlo Fonseka, who recently made a statement to the media with regard to the late Sobitha Thera.
?Without trying to intimidate the persons who openly talk about the suspiciousness of the prelate?s death by suing them, they should also call the government to launch a thorough investigation in to the matter so that those who are responsible for the incident could be found,? Dr. Herath said.
He added that the civil organisations that worked with the late Sobitha Thera should raise their voice regarding this.
?The so-called civil organisations had been performing before the media when an issue with a governmental hospital was found, but now they are keeping silent,? Dr. Herath added. (Piyumi Fonseka)

How your mobile network and your life insurance cover are connected
	
		 		 
		 
			
It is a fact that Sri Lanka?s life insurance market is under-penetrated and most Sri Lankans are under-protected. With only 12.6 percent of Sri Lankans possessing life insurance (IBSL annual report, 2014), there exists a considerable protection gap in the country.?
What is the gap? ?Ignoring liabilities such as loans, outstanding credit card bills, the rule of thumb is that a family needs x3 annual income as a minimum sum insured. That?s probably the regular cost of a re-load to enable a family to re-cover from the loss of the main income earner?
LMRB research (2014) suggests that even out of this very small segment of life insurance policyholders, only 58 percent think that they are sufficiently covered. This means that the remaining 42 percent realise there is a gap in their required levels of protection. On an interesting note, 16 percent of those who feel sufficiently covered, still think there is room to increase their coverage. This means that while they have taken the initiative to protect themselves and their families, they understand that there is room to close the gap further.?
So what of those that are aware they are not sufficiently covered? The LMRB statistics reveal that 11 percent of life policyholders actually think they need to increase their coverage. These people are acutely aware of a protection gap in their lives and want to bridge it, but haven?t been able to do so as yet. Notably, awareness is half the battle won and they hope to close the gap as soon as finances and opportunity allows.?
But then, there is still a 15 percent who know they are not sufficiently covered but don?t seem to care enough to pursue the matter. Insurance Ombudsman, Dr Wickrema Weerasooria was quoted in a recent interview for Life Insurance Month in September 2015 saying ?you can take a horse to water but you cannot make it drink?! He further cited a recent survey of how household incomes are spent, which showcased that the number one priority was the money reserved for mobile phone re-loads!?
The irony here of course begs the question, ?isn?t yours and your family?s future more important than a mobile re-load???
AIA is the second largest life insurer in the world and all its businesses are in Asia, where it has observed family expenditure choices change across 18 markets over 90 years. Spending prioritisation evolves from first fulfilling basic needs to a basket that includes life insurance. It is interesting that a mobile re-load has become a basic necessity.?

Maldives man critical after attack in SL
	
		 		 
		 
			
A Maldivian man is in critical condition after being attacked on a main street in Sri Lanka on Wednesday.
Haveeru has found that 45-year-old Nooraddeen of Thaa Atoll Vilufushi island was robbed before the attack, but the High Commission of Maldives in Colombo could not confirm the reports.
A fellow resident of the island told Haveeru that the victim was attacked as he exited after exchanging dollars to local currency.
"He went to exchange dollars somewhere. It seems the incident occurred after he exited the place," resident said.
Zahiya Zareeer, Maldives High Commissioner to Sri Lanka, said it was difficult to confirm whether the victim was attacked.
But she quoted Sri Lankan police as saying that it was an "accident."
Zahiya said the truth behind the incident is yet to be determined as the victim was in intensive care.
The attack comes in the wake of the brutal stabbing murder of a Maldivian man in Sri Lanka.
Razeen, who is a notorious former gangster, was found dead with stab injuries in an abandoned paddy field near the Tumbovila Bridge in Piliyandala on November 5.?
Two suspects -- a Maldivian and his Sri Lankan accomplice -- have been taken into custody.(Haveeru)

The mother of the three year old boy who had been abandoned near a bathing spot on the bund of the Mahakanadarawa tank in Mihintale surrendered to the Mihintale Police on Wednesday.
She confessed that her husband had left her a long time ago and that she was working on a poultry farm in Kuliyapitiya.
?I keep the child at a friend?s house in Mahakanadarawa as I cannot take him with me. I go to the place where he is staying and look into his needs every weekend. I did not leave him on the bund,? she told the police.
The woman who handed over the child to the police has also been questioned to verify the statement given by the mother.
The woman had told the police what the child?s mother said was true. ?A neighbour told me that I would fall into trouble by keeping a northerner?s child. I was frightened on hearing that and handed over the child to the police saying that I found him on the bund of the Mahakanadarawa tank concealing the fact that he had been with me for a long time. I told the child to tell the police that his mother came on a bike with an uncle and left him there,? the woman said.
The woman who took care of the child had given a statement to the police saying that the child must have said so following her instructions.

Won't do anything to harm ties with SL: Maldives
	
Maldives has assured Sri Lanka of strong bilateral relations in a bid to mend ties that had been strained as a result a series of diplomatic spats between the two countries.
Foreign minister Dhunya Maumoon told reporters on Tuesday that the Maldives and Sri Lanka has even now a very strong relationship. She highlighted that the Maldives has always provided any assistance requested by the Sri Lankan government.
?I want to assure [our Sri Lankan partners] that we?re still with Sri Lanka. We won?t do anything that may have an adverse effect on the relationship we?ve,? the minister said, during a press conference at her office in capital Male.
Relations between Maldives and Sri Lanka suffered a deep blow early this month as the South Asian neighbour accused the Maldives of using historically warm bilateral ties to crackdown on Maldivian political and social media activists.
In a statement, Sri Lanka?s external affairs ministry said Sri Lanka is deeply concerned about recent developments in the Maldives and events that have impacted on Sri Lanka, including the arrest of two Sri Lankan nationals in the Maldives and the questionable removal of a Maldivian social media activist who was in possession of a valid Sri Lankan visa. It is deeply disturbing that Sri Lanka, a country which has always maintained the closest friendly relations with the Maldives, is being used to initiate questionable action against political and social media activists, it added.
?Sri Lanka encourages the government of the Maldives to ensure that recent developments are not allowed to escalate into a source of regional instability,? the statement read.
The condemnation by Sri Lanka came a day after it summoned the Maldives top representative in the country over the arrest and subsequent repatriation of a suspect wanted in connection to a recent blast on a presidential speedboat.

Prices of ten essential commodities to fall
	
	The expansion of the tax net and reduction of prices of ten essential commodities will be among the main proposals of The ?Budget 2016? to be presented in Parliament by Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayaka tomorrow, a senior Cabinet Minister disclosed today.
	Special Assignments Minister Dr. Sarath Amunugama told the media that the first budget speech of the UNP led consensual government would be a development, investment, revenue growth and relief oriented one with the target to achieve an accelerated GDP growth in the next five years.
	?It is a known fact that government?s tax revenue is inadequate and the tax collection mechanism is weak. Therefore, the budget 2016 will focus its attention to expand the tax net further to include more effluent and taxable people into the government?s tax system. However, I assure you that the reformed tax regime will not affect the poorer section of the society,? Minister Amunugama stressed.
	Minister Amunugama said the government tax collection through 30 tax regimes was inadequate and sufficient to meet only the recurrent expenditure.
	The government is to increase budgetary allocations for social welfare health, education and in addition to capital for various government development projects. That is why the government is compelled to increase tax revenue and up the bar on taxable people.
	Minister Amunugama without elaborating said the budget 2016 would also lower the prices of ten essential commodities in the similar manner the government did by bringing down the prices of 13 consumer goods including power tariff and bus fares from the mini budget in January 29 by lifting tax on them.

	Sri Lanka is in the process of increasing the share of skilled and professional workers among its citizens seeking employment in Saudi Arabia, new Sri Lankan Ambassador Azmi Thassim, who arrived in Riyadh last week, told Arab News on Tuesday.
	Sri Lankan professionals such as doctors, engineers, lawyers, accountants and ICT experts have found lucrative positions in the far east, western countries and some Gulf states including the UAE and Qatar, he pointed out.
	He said Sri Lankan leaders appreciate the support provided by the Saudi government to its economic development and migrant workers.
	?We have a high literacy rate and therefore the youth are in position to learn employment skills and easily adapt themselves to the work environment,? he said.
	The Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment headed by Minister of Foreign Employment Thalatha Atukorale is dedicated to serve the island?s overseas workers who bring in large sums of foreign exchange to the national coffers.
	Thassim succeeds former envoy Mohamed Hussein Mohamed who left the Kingdom in August on completion of his diplomatic tenure.
	The envoy, accompanied by his wife, Sithi Dane Arfa, arrived at the VIP lounge of King Khalid International Airport in Riyadh where he was accorded a red-carpet welcome by well wishers and his embassy staff.
	Officials from the Foreign Ministry were also present at the reception held at the lounge following his arrival.
	Thassim said he intends to boost Lankan tourism. ?We see a remarkable increase in Arab tourists coming to the island, particularly from Saudi Arabia,? he said, adding that Sri Lanka is an island that could offer the best to Saudi tourists for family holiday, children?s entertainment and for honeymooning.
	?There are several areas where Saudi businessmen could invest in viable sectors,? he said, adding that these new sectors will be unfolded to Saudi entrepreneurs during his tenure in office.

SL maid to be stoned to death; ministry files appeal
	
Government had filed an appeal before the Riyad Court in Saudi Arabia, on behalf of the Sri Lankan female domestic worker, who was recently sentenced to be stoned to death after being found guilty of having a clandestine affair, Foreign Employment Ministry said.
The Ministry sources said the woman was married and having children in Sri Lanka, when she had convicted for adultery with a Sri Lankan youth employed in Saudi Arabia.
After she was produced before the Riyad Court, the woman had pleaded guilty and she was sentenced to be stoned to death according to Saudi Arabian law.
The youth who had having the affair with Lankan woman had been given 100 lashes as punishment, Foreign Employment Minister Thalatha Athukorala?s Media Secretary Nalin Rajapaksha said.
?Since she had pleaded guilty, we are unable to request the Saudi government to lift the sentence. Therefore, our minister Athukorala filed an appeal before the Riyad Court with the purpose of lifting the woman?s punishment. The ministry had already made payments for the lawyers too through the Saudi Embassy in Sri Lanka,? Mr. Rajapaksha said.
According to the ministry, eight women have been sentenced to death in Lebanon, one had been sentenced to be stoned to death and one woman had been murdered in Kuwait.
Recently, Minister Athukorala told media that the Foreign Employment Act would be amended soon to add several requirements to facilitate migrant workers, especially for those who work in the Mid-Eastern countries. (Piyumi Fonseka)

UNWGEID reveals details of a 'secret' detention camp
	
	The United Nations Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances (UNWGEID) concluding its visit to Sri Lanka today said they found an ?unofficial? detention centre operating within the confines of a Navy camp in Trincomalee where detainees had been held for prolonged periods and likely tortured.
	A member of the UNWGEID, Ariel Dulitzky also emphasised the need to repeal the PTA, pointing out that several of its provisions provided room for a climate of enforced disappearances to take place.
	Underground cells where victims were interrogated and cell walls with dates engraved by distressed detainees were among the unnerving images that met the independent experts of the UNWGEID when they visited the secret detention centre, accompanied by some CID officials as part of their ten-day mission.
	At the press conference held last evening at the UN Compound in Colombo to announce the concluding remarks of their visit, the independent experts said there were 12 cells in the sector of the detention facility that they visited, the interiors of which indicated that the detainees were probably held in the locations for prolonged periods.
	?We saw the number 20100725 engraved on a wall and we guess it is a date ? July 25, 2010. All that we saw during our visit bears evidence to the fact that the location which had earlier been used for storing arms, was systematically used as a detention centre,? Tae-Ung Baik of the UNWGEID told the media.
	Vice-Chair of the Working Group, Bernard Duhaime who also commented on their visit to the secret detention facility said that, although specific reasons for the existence of the facility or evidence of torture, or inhumane or degrading treatment have not yet been identified, strong evidence points at an ample lack of a transparency during the first stages of arrests of the detainees held in the location, and lack of guarantees of due processes for the arrestees.
	He also noted that their fact finding exercises revealed that victims held at the location were likely held in another site in Colombo before being transferred to Trincomalee. He added that the high security maintained within the premises, and the strong control of the entrance and exit points to the compound indicate that the victims could not have been transported to the location without the knowledge of those standing on guard and the authorities.
	?It is an important discovery, and an important site, which we believe should be properly investigated. The dates carved into cell walls indicate that, if there was an effective investigation from 2009 onwards on the disappearances, some lives could have been saved,? UNWGEID expert Dulitzky said.
	He went on to state that, so far, only 11 potential victims had been identified in relation to the location; but added that it was probable that many more people were detained in the facility, based on the number of cells and the years that it had been used.
	Duhaime said that, despite Sri Lanka?s history of the use of disappearances on a massive and systematic scale for decades, as a means of suppressing political dissent during the war, and even after (which were carried out by state officials or affiliated paramilitary groups; and followed by an almost complete lack of judicial accountability) the present time has presented a historic opportunity to ensure justice is delivered to the victims and their families.
	He stressed on the importance of ensuring the rights of the victims? families and expressed concern over intimidating tactics, threats, sexual abuse and other forms of coercion or vengeance followed by some security and investigatory officials against families who sought justice for their loved ones who were missing. He said they had received information that some of the persons with whom they met were questioned in relation to the visit of the UNWGEID.
	?These acts are absolutely unacceptable in a democratic society,? he said.
	This is the fourth visit undertaken by the UNWGEID following their visits to Sri Lanka in 1991, 1992 and 1999. Over the years, it has transmitted over 12000 cases to the GoSL, of which 5750 are still pending. While commending the fact that massive scale disappearances no longer occur in the country, the independent experts however announced a series of recommendations to be considered by the government of Sri Lanka to ensure truth, non-recurrence and reparations.
	?We are encouraged by the measures adopted by the Government of Sri Lanka in the recent months, particularly the stand taken at the recent UNHRC sessions. But we believe many challenges still exist in delivering justice to the victims,? he said.
	The UNWGEID experts also welcomed the proposal to create an office for missing persons, but added that it was vital that it should have all the necessary technical capacity to conduct exhumations and was equipped with the requisite forensic expertise; noting they were concerned with the present lack of technical capacity domestically to conduct a proper exhumation or DNA tests.
	They also noted that a separate, comprehensive legislation must be enacted that clearly states that enforced disappearance is a continuous crime to which amnesties, immunities or statute of limitations cannot be applied -- especially in the context of crimes against humanity.
	Among the other recommendations made was one to ensure the conclusion of the mandate given to the commission appointed to probe into disappearances. ?This Commission does not have the confidence and trust of the victims; and its serious shortcomings should be addressed. To that end, its findings should be immediately transferred to the new office that has been proposed,? UNWGEID expert Dulitzky said.
	The experts also commended the proposal to include the presence of international judicial experts in the accountability mechanism that is to be established and implemented, and noted that the lack of confidence that victims? families bear in the government, and the lack of capacity of the judiciary to properly investigate and prosecute certain crimes -- all of which could be addressed through such a measure.
	Meanwhile, UNWGEID expert Baik proposed the initiation of a system to issue certificates of absence, instead of death certificates, so that the families of disappeared persons could access the compensation systems that have been made available to them for the past few years -- but to no avail due to the absence of proof of death.
