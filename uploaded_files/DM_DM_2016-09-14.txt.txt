A sand racket this time round
	

A story has gone viral that the bigwigs of a state-owned company handling a major plantation of a triangle fame is making a name for money-spinning rackets.

The latest business that the company bigwigs have embarked on is dredging wewas (tanks) for sand. The company has struck a deal with government authorities to buy the mud dredged from tanks at Rs.350 a cube and sell the sand extracted from the mud at Rs.7,000 a cube, they say.

These company bigwigs have already been reported to the higher authorities responsible for overseeing their work and the conduct. However, a Diyawanna member from Wayamba well known for his belligerent conduct is shielding the errant company high-ups.
These company bigwigs have already been turning the produce from the plantations into enough gravy for themselves, they say. Just one example would suffice to size up the situation; according to the accounts maintained by the company, believe it or not, the produce from certain estates in the triangle is so poor the average yield for a kanna (harvest-turn) from one tree is just one nut!

A smoldering feud
	

A state agency tasked with re-settling the war-displaced was recently established by the new Big Boss. He appointed a Swamy from the North as the head of this agency and a Bullah from the East as the Deputy.

The head of the state agency and his deputy soon fell out. The feud continued unabated and the deputy from the East finally met the Big Boss armed with his letter of resignation.
The deputy explained in the letter why he could not continue to work with the head who, he alleged, did not understand the meaning of politics. 
The Big Boss exhorted the deputy not to get unduly upset and asked the second in command to settle the dispute between the Head and the Deputy.
The second in command brought about a settlement between the two antagonists after talking things over with them. However, informed ones say that though the fire is no more, sparks continue to simmer under the ashes

CA Sri Lanka engages stakeholders on ETCA
	
Speakers at the panel session from left: Ranel Wijesinha, Reyaz Mihular, Dr. Saman Kelegama, Lasantha Wickremasinghe, Dinuk Hettiarachchi and Nishan Fernando
In its capacity as the national body of accountants, the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka (CA Sri Lanka) recently engaged its stakeholders by conducting a forum exclusively for the benefit of its members focusing on the Economic and Technology Co-Operation Agreement (ETCA) between India and Sri Lanka.
The forum was organised in an effort to provide CA Sri Lanka members, who are chartered accountants, an in-depth understanding on the ETCA and also obtain views from the members with regard to the proposed agreement which has generated interest in the recent past across all professional spheres.
The guest speaker at the forum was Institute of Policy Studies Executive Director Dr. Saman Kelegama, who shared his views on the agreement between India and Sri Lanka with the members of the institute.
Speaking at the event, CA Sri Lanka President Lasantha Wickremasinghe said that the ETCA has generated a lot of interest in recent months among the professional community and there has been both positive and negative sentiments expressed on the agreement that the government hopes to sign with India.
Bilateral agreements are seen as an important method in accelerating growth between countries. However, any bilateral or regional agreement that Sri Lanka signs must be supportive of the countrys holistic interests including economic interest, while also taking the interest of the people, Wickremasinghe said.
Therefore, he noted that it was important for any government to ensure that all pros and cons are taken into account and to also carry out the necessary consultations with all relevant stakeholders before signing such agreements.
In our capacity as the national body of accountants and also taking into account the interest the ETCA has generated in the recent past, we thought it was important to organise this forum, for the benefit of our members in order for them to gain an in-depth understating on the agreement, he added. The forum aimed to clarify if the accounting profession was affected by the proposed agreement and evaluate the pros and cons of it, while giving members of CA Sri Lanka a platform to share their thoughts as well on
the agreement.
The forum was followed by a panel discussion comprising of Dr. Saman Kelegama, Lasantha Wickremasinghe, Management Consultant Ranel Wijesinha, KPMG Managing Partner Reyaz Mihular and Nihal Hettiarachchi& Company Chief Executive Officer and Managing Partner Dinuk Hettiarachchi. The session was moderated by BDO Consulting (Pvt.) Ltd Managing Director Nishan Fernando.

Chanuka Ratwatte and four others, who were arrested by the Financial Crimes Investigation Division (FCID) were today remanded till September 28 by the Colombo Fort Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne.
The son of former Defence Minister, the late Anuruddha Ratwatte, had been arrested in connection with an alleged misappropriation of Rs. 4.2 billion government funds. Mr. Chanuka Ratwatte is also the brother of Joint Opposition MP Lohan Ratwatte.
The prosecution alleged that the suspects had misused the funds belonging to the four Departments of the Central Bank and the Employees Provident Fund at the CEB, while investing those funds in the Government Securities through a company named Entrust Securities PLC, which is headed by the suspects.
The Central Bank took over Entrust Securities PLC this January and handed it over to the National Savings Bank as the management agent, to restructure the troubled primary dealer.
The Central Bank however did not directly admit uncovering of any fraudulent activities by the company or its top management, but said it was taken over to ensure the credibility of the Government securities market.
The FCID said the suspects were members of the alleged company, which was registered under the Central Bank as a primary sales broking company to invest in securities and bonds.
They told court that the Government funds were never invested in the securities, but were transferred into the Entrust Ltd. causing a huge financial loss to the government.
The suspects were charged under the section 5(3) and 8(3) of the Public Property Act and section 386 of the Penal Code over criminal breach of trust and misappropriation.
The suspects are Dharmapriya Bandara Dassanayake (Chairman, of the Entrust Securities Plc), Chanuka Ratwatte (Managing Director), Romesha Dushanthi Senarath, Executive Director), Sanjeewa Dayaratne (Director) and Niloshan Romelo Mendis (Director).
The FCID conducted investigations over the allegations following a complaint from the Central Bank. (Shehan Chamika Silva)

Coal issue: A tangle within a tangle
	

The fiasco over the controversial coal tender has taken a new twist, they say.

Initially many said that the villain of the piece is a certain political authority who keeps on interpreting the court order and the governments official stand on this issue to suit his own designs.
All machinations of this political authority are aimed at ensuring the procurement of coal supplies continuously from the errant supplier whom the probe committees had blacklisted, they charged.

Meanwhile, a coal company bigwig has entered the fray vowing that he would not give up his fight to become the sole supplier. He is getting the active backing of a group of purohitas, they say.
Incidentally, a certain yahapalanaya purohita is now set to expose in the august assembly a certain white collar bigwig as the de facto evil force behind the coal tender issue.

Court abates case against Frm. SC Judge Abrew
	
The Colombo High Court today abated the case in which former Supreme Court Justice, the late Sarath de Abrew, who was indicted for sexually abusing his female servant, since the accused is no longer alive.
Former Supreme Court Judge Justice Sarath de Abrew had died following an accident at his residence on August 15, 2016.
Abating the proceedings of the case, High Court Judge Nisaanka Bandula Karunaratne, considering the legal concept of that no one is guilty until proven, observed that prosecution had not proven the allegations put forward against former SC Justice beyond reasonable doubt yet, therefore, he was still an innocent individual.
Meanwhile, the Counsel, who appeared on behalf of the former Justice's daughter, sought the court to advise prosecution to withdraw indictments on basis that the accused was no longer alive.
However, State Counsel Udara Karunaratne, who appeared for the Attorney General said that there was no provision in law to withdraw indictments based on accuseds death during the proceedings.
The Attorney General withdraws indictments, when sufficient prosecution evidence are not in place or missing during the proceedings or otherwise in such instances the Court is allowed to conclude the case proceedings upon the death of the accused, he said.
The AG had earlier indicted the accused on two counts over sexually abusing his 38-year-old maid on or around June 16, 2015 in Ratmalana under section 365(a)(2) of the Penal Code. (Shehan Chamika Silva and Farook Thajudeen)

Commissioner General of Motor Traffic A.H.K. Jagath Chandrasiri said 313,465 vehicles had been registered under the department in the first eight months of this year.
About half of them were motor cycles, he said.
668,907 vehicles had been registered in 2015 and this was record. No any other year recorded such high number of registrations, Mr. Chandrasiri said.
The recent Customs Valuation Tax and increased VAT had brought about a change in interest rates which resulted in an increase in the vehicle prices. This may have caused low number of registrations, he said. (Chaturanga Pradeep)

In its debut year the service saw the channelling of approximately Rs. 1.8 billion worth of transactions. The USD Online, the first of its kind to be launched in Sri Lanka, was a breakthrough in the banking and financial industry with the service having driven speed and efficiency on all interbank US Dollar transfers, along with facilitating the flow of foreign exchange savings into the economy.USD Online essentially allows the movement of funds between banks the same day without having to go through NOSTRO accounts maintained with correspondent banks in the US.

We are confident that volumes and value of transactions via this newchannel would continue to move along a positive growth trajectory in the coming years, stated Amarasuriya.
The service allowed its users to reap a number of benefits including the reduction of the per transaction cost due to the elimination of costs incurred for NOSTRO and intermediary bank charges.

Last (hopper) dinner with successor echoes in their conversation
	

The former strongman who recently paid a visit to the Land of the Malays, was accorded a right royal welcome by the VIPs of the state as well as the Sri Lankan expatriate community in that country.

The former strongman called on the highest political authority of that country on invitation and on that occasion the two leaders spent a long time recalling shared memories and swapping amusing political anecdotes. The VVIP host, during this intimate conversation had posed a few questions which caused the Sri Lankan guest a measure of discomfiture, they say.
Questions and answers had run as follows:
VVIP host: Is it correct that your successor  the incumbent one  was a member of the top team in your government
The former strongman: Yes. He handled the Health portfolio.
VVIP: He was the general secretary of your political party as well
The former strongman: Yes.
Then came the question that unsettled the Sri Lankan guest a little bit.
Is it correct that he shared a hopper dinner with you at your official residence the night before he quit the government to contest the election against you
The distinguished guest had first greeted this query with a guffaw.
However, he later gave a lengthy answer to this question, they say.

Missing youth: Police admits shortcomings
	
The disappearance of a youth in Hambantota after he was taken in along with two others, could be a result of a shortcoming on the part of the Police, Acting Police Spokesman SSP Ajith Rohana said today.
SSP Rohana, who attended the Cabinet briefing, said an investigation was being carried out to determine, what exactly had happened.
There has been a shortcoming on the part of the Police as the records of the Tangalle Police had stated only two had been arrested over a theft, though three had been arrested, he said.
Police personnel involved will be dealt with in accordance with the Establishment Code and the procedures pertaining to Police, if found they were involved in any unlawful act, he added.
He said the IGP had ordered to expedite investigations within days.
However, SSP Rohana said there was confusion on the incident, as the relatives of the youth had said he had disappeared, while the Policemen who arrested him had stated that the youth had escaped.
He said the Policemen who went on the operation to arrest the suspect, had gone in a private vehicle rather than going in a Police jeep.
They are not bound to go in a Police vehicles on operations, he however said. (Yohan Perera)

The country should be governed either by President Maithripala Sirisena or Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe without contradicting each other, Former President and Kurunegala MP Mahinda Rajapaksa said today.
He said this while speaking to the media at the launch of a book by author Edward Chandrasiri at the Public Library, Colombo.
He said the President, the Prime Minister and the Cabinet of Ministers were making contradictory statements on issues relating to the country and that showed the coalition government had no plan for the country.
He said the United National Party (UNP) and the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) had joined together only to share power and not to work for the nation.
While warning that the country is being dragged towards a very dangerous situation, MP Rajapaksa said he would never support a government that kneels before the international community.
He also rejected media reports that spoke of an agreement that was entered into between the UNP and the Joint Opposition.
Commenting on yesterdays arrest and questioning of former Defence Minister late Anuruddha Ratwattes son Chanuka Ratwatte and MP Wimal Weerawansa respectively, Mr. Rajapaksa said he had confidence that the two had done nothing wrong. (Piyumi Fonseka)

This piece of news had first come up during an informal discussion held by three to four Blue purohitas on the sidelines of the party convention, they say.
One of the threesome set to do the pole-vault to the Green camp is said to be a politico from the Kurunegala area who made several foreign trips with Green party stalwarts in the recent past. The fact that there is a sizable support base for the former strongman in his electorate has led this character to seriously consider teaming up with the Greens for the sake of his political future.
Another Betel leaf heavyweight set to take political refuge in the Green party is a talkative one from the hills. This one lost at the last polls but was lucky enough to enter the council through the charity list. The third one is from the Colombo district. The party has placed him in charge of an important electorate. He suffered a big blow to his political ambitions when he was defeated at the last polls. Of late he has been seen moving closely with the Green party leaders, they say.

Too big for his boots
	

A government department responsible for law enforcement and public security celebrated its 145th anniversary on a grand scale recently.

The Big Boss attended the event as its Chief Guest. The Chair of the august assembly too was present as a guest of honour. The purohita in charge of the related portfolio also participated as a distinguished guest. 
According to the tradition, on occasions such as this, the Chief Guest seated on the stage is flanked by the Guest of Honour and the purohita in charge of the subject at the top table. However, at this event, while the Chair of the assembly was seen seated next to the Big Boss on one side it was the head of the department who took the chair next to the Big Boss on the other side.
As a result, the purohita in charge of the subject had to take a seat several places away from the Big Boss.
The affront caused to the purohita concerned has been formally reported to the authorities in the highest echelons for necessary action.
Incidentally, this was not the first occasion where this high-minded departmental head had violated the order of precedence in regard to seating at official functions, they say.

What if Jan. 8 transformation did not happen, President asks
	
President Maithripala Sirisena yesterday questioned those who criticize him and the government what would have been the situation of our country if the January 8 transformation had not taken place.
Without experiencing that eventuality, some people criticize the actions taken by the government to face the critical economic crisis and the issues raised by the international community, he said. He invited them to present possible solutions for these issues instead of criticizing.
The President expressed these views at the launching ceremony of the book Ma Dutu Janavari 8 (The January 8 witnessed by me), written by the Member of Parliament Malith Jayathilaka, held yesterday at the Kingsbury Hotel, Colombo.
It is the responsibility of those who gave a helping hand to that victory, to ensure that the country is benefitted by it, he emphasized. He invited those who contributed as well as did not contribute to the January 8 victory to fulfill their responsibilities for the country today.
President Sirisena said that the very true and correct facts on January 8 transformation were still hidden. He commended the attempt taken by Mr. Malith Jayathilaka to report such facts without any fear.
The President said all those who know regarding the transformation that took place on January 08 have an understanding how complex and how far it has to be studied. Hence, it is necessary for them to talk openly about that pure transformation of January 8 and today it is very important to speak regarding that transformation by persons who involved to make that change, he said.
