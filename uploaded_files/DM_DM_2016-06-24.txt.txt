Soyza hits out at Basil's party
	
The break away group of the SLFP, the joint opposition and the new party reported to be formed by former Minister Basil Rajapaksa are doomed for disaster as the SLFP's history has proved in numerous occasions that not a single politician or group had succeeded after betraying the party, Irrigation and Water Resources Management Minister Wijith Vijayamuni Soyza said yesterday.
He said with the aim of holding the local government polls in the first quarter of 2017, the SLFP would fro call applications with immediate effect and start interviews on July 19, Minister Vijayamuni Soyza said.
Minister Silva added that President Maithripala Sirisena had already announced that all qualified SLFP applicants would get nominations to contest the poll.
This is going to be a Litmus Test for those who are pulling the leg of the SLFP and President Sirisena. They must decide whether to perish with those who are dreaming of forming a new party or a new government or find success and progress with the SLFP led by President Sirisena Minister Soyza said.
Addressing the media at the weekly news briefing at the SLFP head office, Minister Silva said the SLFP Central Committee has also decided to hold the 65th Anniversary of the party on September 11 on a grand scale and a ten member organizing committee chaired by Transport and Civil Aviation Minister Nimal Sirisipala De Silva has been appointed.
The best example is the Sri Lanka Mahajana Pakshaya formed by popular actor Vijaya Kumaratunga after leaving the SLFP. He formed the Sri Lanka Mahajana Pakshaya when he was in the peak of popularity and was a great crowd puller where ever he went. But he could not win a single election and enter Parliament. Even former President Chandrika Kumaratunga tasted victory at Provincial Councils, Parliamentary and Presidential polls after coming back to the SLFP, he said.
Minister Silva responding to a journalist, said the downfall of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa was a making of his family members and Basil Rajapaksa in particular who deserted the party after the Parliamentary polls defeat in August.
The so called joint opposition or those who abandoned the party do not have a future and they are doomed as all those who betrayed the party in the past. Therefore, it is the responsibility of all SLFPers who truly love the party to extend their support to party leader President Sirisena to take the party to victory at the local government polls and then after to the Presidential and Parliamentary elections, he stressed.
The interviews to select SLFP candidates for the local government polls will begin from July 19 from the Kandy District and conclude on November 11 from Colombo and Gampaha.
A three member committee led by Ministers Ranjith Siyambalapitiya, S.B.Dissanayake, Anura Priyadharshana Yapa, Susil Premajayantha, Wijith Vijayamuni Soyza, Fizer Musthapha and Chandima Weerakkodi has been appointed to conduct interviews for candidates of the 25 districts.
A four member committee has been appointed by the CC of the SLFP headed by Minister A.H.M.Fowzy for the 8 districts in the North-East.
Another 16 committees chaired by senior cabinet Ministers have also been appointed to re-organize the part from the grass roots level and covering agriculture, banking, trade union, public service and the private sector. (Sandun A Jayasekera)

Will not get into Katchatheevu case: Madras HC
	
The Madras high court has declined to interfere with the India-Sri Lanka agreement, and subsequent executive orders, on the Katchatheevu issue saying the issue could be best resolved through diplomatic channels and not through court directives, the Times of India said today.
"This court has no jurisdiction to enforce a writ on the Sri Lankan government...These are matters which have to be left to diplomatic channels of the two countries. The problem exists is not in doubt, but the solution cannot be by issuing a writ of mandamus, that too indirectly affecting what the Sri Lankan government does. We thus leave this issue to the wisdom of the government authorities," said the first bench of Chief Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul and Justice R Mahadevan, on Thursday.
The judges were passing orders on a PIL by Fisherman Care represented by its president L T A Peter Rayan, seeking a direction to the Centre to give effect to Article 6 of a 1974 agreement between India and Sri Lanka in letter and spirit by taking diplomatic steps. The agreement made it clear Indian fishermen and pilgrims would enjoy access to Katchatheevu and would not be required to obtain Sri Lankan travel documents or visas for these purposes. The agreement further said vessels of India and Sri Lanka would enjoy in each other's waters such rights as they had traditionally enjoyed.
OnMarch 23, 1976, letters were exchanged between governments of India and Sri Lanka asking vessels of Indian fishermen not to engage in fishing in the historic waters, territorial sea and exclusive economic zone of Sri Lanka. The present PIL wanted a direction to the Centre to delete this letter, which came after the agreement.
Dismissing the PIL as being not maintainable, the bench said: "It is trite to say that sea wealth forms an important part of today's economics and thus countries have become more conscious of it. What has transpired is also now 40 years old."

Insurers cope with Sri Lanka floods, but risks increasing: Fitch
	
Insurance claims arising from recent flooding in Sri Lanka are likely to be manageable for most local insurers due to low retention levels, but changing weather patterns raise long-term risks, says Fitch Ratings.
The agency expects the sectors underwriting profitability to weaken in 2016, although this is unlikely to threaten most insurers credit profiles.
A severe tropical storm in mid-May caused flooding and landslides in several parts of the country, with areas along the Kelani River in the western province, north-east of the capital, Colombo, among the worst affected. National Insurance Trust Fund (NITF), the state-owned local reinsurer, estimates claims from the disaster of around Rs. 15.5 billion (US$ 107 million).
Fitch expects record-high claims to worsen the combined ratio of non-life insurers in 2016, with higher reinsurance premiums raising future expense ratios. In addition, lower profitability, stemming from higher claims, could affect capitalisation of some lower-capitalised insurers. Fitch says the credit profiles of rated entities, Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation Limited (AA(lka)/Stable), HNB General Insurance Limited (A(lka)/Stable) and Continental Insurance Lanka Limited (A-(lka)/Stable), are likely to remain intact despite these challenges.
Sri Lankan non-life insurers have low retention in the non-motor segment, with more than two thirds of the fire class, which typically covers flood-related policies, being reinsured. Fire class accounted for just 5 percent of total non-life net written premium in 2015. Local regulations require insurers to cede 30 percent of their reinsurance to NITF, with the balance reinsured with the global reinsurance market. Natural catastrophe losses, such as floods, are covered under reinsurance treaties and excess-of-loss reinsurance covers.
Fitch says the foods are likely to raise awareness and increase demand for non-life insurance. Sri Lankas uninsured population is high, with non-life penetration at around 0.6 percent of GDP. The non-life insurance market is dominated by motor insurance (65 percent of gross written premiums in 2015). Motor is covered under excess-of-loss reinsurance covers in the event of natural catastrophe.
Changing weather patterns, leading to increased frequency and severity of errant rainfall, raise long-term risks and highlight the need for insurance and proper pricing of such risk, as well as robust flood defence mechanisms, Fitch says. In early April 2016, the government obtained its first natural disaster cover from NITF, insuring itself against Rs.10 billion, with the first claim coming just six weeks later from the May floods.
The Government of Sri Lanka Disaster Management Centre says the May floods, reportedly the worst in 25 years, affected over 300,000 people, leaving 203 dead or missing and over 5,000 houses damaged. Production and storage facilities of several large companies were damaged and business has been interrupted. According to NITF, a handful of large commercial claims are expected to account for over half of total claims.

Joint Opposition protest march against Mahendran
	
A chaotic situation prevailed as the Joint Opposition demonstrated and staged a protest march demanding the resignation of Central Bank Governor Arjun Mahendran accused of a bond scam and for the cancellation of the recent tax hikes.
Its MPs, along with their supporters, assembled at the Lakehouse Junction and proceeded towards the Central Bank building shouting slogans.
However, the protest march was barricaded. The protesters broke through the first line barricade and tried to proceed.
Yet, they turned back after encountering the second line of barricade. Then, they took a detour to reach the Finance Ministry.
A large crowd of protestors led by MPs including Dinesh Gunawardena, Bandula Gunawardane, Wimal Weerawansa, Mahindananda Aluthgamage, Vasudeva Nanyakkara, C.B. Ratnayake, Janaka Bandara Tennakoon and many others headed towards the Finance Ministry. They sat on the Lotus Road outside the Finance Ministry entrance.
They urged the resignation of not only the CB governor but also the Finance Minister and the Prime Minister.
We demand the resignations of the CB governor, Minister Ravi Karunanayake and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe for leading the country towards economic crisis. They should resign for imposing heavy taxes on the people as well, MP Bandula Gunawardane said.
MP Wimal Weerawansa said they have launched the campaign to send the government home within this year and assured they will not back down until their target was achieved.
The government is doing everything they can to silent MPs of the Joint Opposition. Our colleagues are being put in jail but nothing can prevent us from sending the government home and raising voice against the CB governor, who is responsible for the Bond Sale scam which had resulted in financial hardship today. The Premier had summoned the Auditor General and influenced him regarding the probe into Mr. Mahendran's case. We request the Auditor General to remain independent and assure that we will stand by him, he said.
Joint Opposition Leader MP Dinesh Gunawardane said the power of the people could not be suppressed as they will continue to protest against Mahendran though a probe into the Bond Sale scam where an attempt is made for the issue to be swept under the carpet.
MP Namal Rajapaksa said the government cannot be trusted and it was not concerned about the people. He said the Premier was more concerned about the Brexit than the issues faced by own people.
Two MPs injured
Joint Opposition MPs Rohitha Abeygunawardane and Sriyani Wijewickrama were hospitalised after they were injured during the protest when the barricades came down.
The pressure of the stampede was intensified pushing the MPs leading the protest against the barricades on Bank of Ceylon Mawatha. The barricades came down and the MPs headed towards the Central Bank.
However, MP Abeygunawardane was seen struck between two iron rods of a barricade. Soon after another barricade fell on top of his head and he was rushed to a private hospital by MP Johnston Fernando.
MP Johnston Fernando told the media gathered at the private hospital where the injured MP was receiving treatment that the government attempted to crush their protest by putting barricades.
Our peaceful protest was blocked by the government which resulted in MPs ending up in hospital. Rohitha was unconscious for a while and his condition is somewhat serious, he said and added MP Abeygunawardane was about to undergo an MRI scan.
He said the scan report will say more about the condition of the injured MP who was admitted to the ICU.
Meanwhile, Chief Nursing of the National Hospital, Pushpa Ramyani Soyza said MP Sriyani Wijewickrama was conscious and undergoing treatment for a knee injury. (Lahiru Pothmulla)
