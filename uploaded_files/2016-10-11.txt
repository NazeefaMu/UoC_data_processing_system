A women hater?
	
?
The head of a certain state-run establishment who happens to be the brother-in-law of a leading member of the top team in yahapalanaya, has become a ?veritable terror? to the female employees of the establishment.
?
By the way, the employees of the place had blocked this high-up?s access to his office during a recent industrial action.
Employees charge that this high-up who behaves like a typical lunatic harass the female workers after making cooked up allegations against them.
A group of aggrieved female workers giving evidence at a high-powered official committee gave the chapter and verse of the high-up?s obnoxious conduct, they say. ? ??

Aiyo! is now part of Oxford dictionary
	
The 'aiyo' word- a Sri Lankan and South Indian phrase that expresses distress, regret or grief, was included in the Oxford English Dictionary (OED), last month as a part of the latest addition of words to its database.
OED has defined the popular word as, "In southern India and Sri Lanka, expressing distress, regret, or grief; 'Oh no!', 'Oh dear!'"
Apart from aiyo, 'aiyoh' and 'aiyah' have also been included in the lexicon, India Today reported. Though the two words can be identified as part of the Indian vocabulary too, OED has actually included their Chinese usage.
The latest addition saw the inclusion of various Singapore English words like mamak (Malaysian word for street stall), pancit (flat tyre) and even popular dishes from Singapore and South-east Asia like "char kway teow", "chicken rice" and "rendang".
The dictionary also paid a sort of a tribute to author Roald Dahl, by adding words he invented like "splendiferous", "human bean" and "Oompa Loompa." The children's books writer's birthday falls in September too.
The OED updates its bank of words four times in a year, and almost every year some people find its choices like "srsly", "squee", obvs" and "omg" hard to believe. Some quirky entries can be found in this month's list too, including biatch, butt-f**k, jagoff, 'Merica, scrumdiddlyumptious, moobs, yoda and YOLO.
The Oxford English Dictionary has been the foremost authority on the English language, all over the world. OED is more than 150 years old and contains at least 6,00,000 entries. It is updated four times -- March, June, September, and December -- in a year.

Allocation for presidential expenditure up by 320%: NFF
	
The National Freedom Front (NFF) today claimed that the funds allocated under the heading of presidential expenditure had been increased by 320 per cent and the funds allocated for education was reduced by 57.6 per cent in the 2017 Appropriation Bill.
NFF media spokesman Mohammed Muzammil said Rs.20 million had bee allocated for the President for a day and it was unethical for President Maithripala Sirisena to do so because he considered himself to be leading a humble lifestyle.
?The 2017 Budget can be considered as one which breaks the promises made by the Government to the people. The total expenditure for the President has increased by 320 per cent by reducing the facilities allocated to the people,? he said.
He said State Minister Lakshman Yapa Abeywardane had indicated that the local government elections would be postponed till June next year.
?It is already 20 months since the elections were first postponed. The question is whether the postponing of the elections is appropriate for the ?Yahapalana Government,? Mr. Muzammil said. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)

CB establishes authenticity of leaked report on primary dealer
	
The Central Bank yesterday in a statement admitted that the report on the controversial primary dealer Perpetual Treasuries, which has been given widespread media coverage, was in fact a leaked internal document, establishing its authenticity.
Until yesterday, despite the much media coverage given to the report, the Central Bank kept mum over it, neither admitting nor denying the existence of such a report.
?The release of this report into the public domain has not been authorized. The Central Bank of Sri Lanka?s internal processes within the Department of Supervision of Non-Bank Financial Institutions have not been completed and the final report has not as yet been submitted to the Monetary Board for its consideration,? the Central Bank said in a statement.
?At its last meeting held on October 3, 2016, the Monetary Board decided to hold a special meeting to consider issues related to the resolution of distressed non-bank financial institutions as well as the operations of primary dealers, including the current concerns regarding Perpetual Treasuries Ltd. This special meeting will be held shortly and was scheduled before the Monetary Board was aware of the unauthorized release of the draft examination report on Perpetual Treasuries Ltd,? it added.
The Central Bank also said it is strengthening its internal control mechanisms to prevent any future unauthorized disclosures. A complaint has also been made to law enforcement authorities to inquire into the unauthorized release of this report, the monetary authority said. Perpetual Treasuries hit the headlines again last week as the primary dealer reported an extraordinary profit of Rs.5.1 billion for the year ended March 31, 2015, up over 400 percent year-on-year, even surpassing profits of some of the mid-size commercial banks.The financial accounts, which were published on a weekend English newspaper, as such publication is made mandatory by the Central Bank as the regulator of the primary dealers, showed the stellar performance was purely due to the Rs.5.2 billion net capital gains made by way of trading government securities.
The country?s bond market was hit by a series of controversial bond auctions involving allegations of rigging and insider dealing in 2015 and 2016 during the tenure of former Governor Arjuna Mahendran, whose son-in-law was the owner of Pepetual Treasuries.
On February 27, 2015, when the Central Bank called bids to raise Rs.1 billion for 30 years but ended up accepting Rs.10 billion, of which a larger share had allegedly been purchased by Perpetual Treasuries at higher rates.
A year later, on March 29, 2016, when the Central Bank called for bids to raise Rs.10 billion (2030 bond), it accepted bids up to Rs.29 billion ? thrice the amount offered? at an extremely higher rate of 14.23 percent.
However, the bond yield significantly came down two days later in the secondary market, opening up an avenue for those who bought the bonds to make thumping profits by selling them.

ComBank launches smartphone-linked mobile POS system for card transactions
	
Commercial Bank?s Chief Operating Officer S. Renganathan (3rd from right) and CBA Solutions CEO Sujith Subasinghe exchange the agreement in the presence of representatives of the two companies
?
?
The Point-of-Sale (POS) enabled merchant base of Commercial Bank of Ceylon is expected to grow significantly with the country?s largest private bank launching mobile Point-of- Sale units in Sri Lanka.
Branded Commercial Bank ?EasyPOS,? the mobile units introduced in collaboration with CBA Solutions, make it possible for any merchant outlet that has a smartphone to acquire one and enhance sales.
Compatible with magnetic strip cards as well as chip cards, the EasyPOS devices run on the ?Payable? app downloadable to the merchant?s smartphone in Android or IOS format. The device communicates with the smartphone via Bluetooth, and can be used anywhere and at any time provided the device and the phone are within range of each other. ?Technology-facilitated convenience continues to be a byword at Commercial Bank,? Commercial Bank Chief Operating Officer S. Renganathan said. ?We always focus on introducing technology that creates a difference in the lives of our customers. The introduction of Easy POS devises will significantly enhance the quality of the service received by customers and will open up more business opportunities for the merchants.?
He also commented that the new mobile Point-of-Sale units would cater to businesses that cannot meet the monthly revenue criteria for a standard, fixed Point-of-Sale unit. ?With one simple device, the Bank has created greater convenience for both customers and merchants,? he added.
Selected merchants will be required to open an account with the Bank. Each unit will be configured to the phone number and smartphone provided by the merchant. This makes it very secure to use since the device is only compatible with the registered phone number and handset, the Bank said.
At the end of each working day, all transactions will be processed and the merchant will be paid through the account. Merchants can view their transaction history through the same phone. ?The focus of our organisation has been to promote cashless card based payments, creating convenience in the everyday lives of Sri Lankans.?
As Sri Lanka?s largest private Bank, Commercial Bank has placed a strong emphasis on technological innovation.?
When combined with its extensive reach, we are confident that this tie-up will create more opportunities for businesses and convenience for customers,? the CEO/Co- Founder of CBA Solutions Sujith Subasinghe said.
EasyPOS is the third technology-linked service enhancement at Commercial Bank within the last three months, and follows the conversion of the Bank?s entire ATM network in Sri Lanka to EMV standard chip card compatibility and the launch of Over-the-Air PIN (OTAP) for the issue of credit and debit/ATM cards.

Constitution making -- Steering Committee to submit report soon
	
Dr. Jayampathi Wickramaratne, who is a member of the Steering Committee on Constitutional Reforms, said yesterday the 21-member Committee would submit a report to the Constitutional Assembly (CA) in two weeks outlining the progress in the constitution-making process.
He told reporters that the drafting of the new Constitution was still in its preliminary stages.
?The six steering committees appointed by the CA are still deliberating on the main subjects such as the State, Sovereignty, Executive Presidency, Electoral System, the Territory of the Republic, Human Rights and Fundamental Rights of the people, devolution of power and so on,? he said.
Dr. Wickramaratne said the views expressed at the news briefing were his own and of none other.
"The first draft will be made after the CC discusses them preceded by the discussions at the sub committees and the public dialogue carried out countrywide," he said.
Responding to a journalist, Dr. Wickramaratne said he was of the view that land and police powers should be devolved to the provinces with the centre having the power to act appropriately under the Constitution in case a provincial council acted arbitrarily violating the Constitution.
?The provincial police force must be given the power to act independently with full administrative authority for recruitment, transfers and taking disciplinary action. The centre and the province must be barred from intervening in police investigations and only the Courts and the Attorney General must have the authority on any judicial matter arising from police inquiries,? he said.
Dr. Wickramaratne said most of the problems with regard to land matters would not have arisen if the government took steps to constitute the National Land Commission under the provisions of the 1978 Constitution.
"Proposals have been received on the Constitutional making process from various organizations and individuals during the public hearing and several views have been expressed on the federal system of governance, unitary character of the state, executive presidency, power devolution with views for and against," he said.
Dr. Wickramaratne said while devolving maximum possible powers to the provinces, there must be a constitutional mechanism for intervention by the centre if and when a province carries out a ?Unilateral declaration of Independence? (UDI) such as what was done by former Eastern Province chief minister Vardaraja Perumal in 1990.
Commenting on the status of religion, he said there was no state religion in Sri Lanka but a first and foremost place was given to Buddhism while protecting and promoting other religions.
?I don?t see the need for any change of this policy in the new Constitution. With the Prime Minister responsible to the legislature having executive powers, a ceremonial President or the Head of State is possible in the new Constitution who can act discreetly and intelligently in a constitutional crisis," he said.
Responding to another question, he said no firm decision had been taken whether it would be a fully fledged new Constitution or amendments to the current Constitution.
"But what is most important is that the new Constitution must address the grievances of all communities in Sri Lanka while bringing sustainable peace, inter-communal harmony and national prosperity while fulfilling the aspirations of all. No one can draft a Constitution to satisfy the entire population. There may be shortcomings and weaknesses in the new Constitution and even it will not be a permanent. But the new Constitution should be drafted under the principles of subsidiary and compromise and added a referendum was not necessary if the new Constitution is approved by the CC with a two-thirds majority," Mr. Wickramaratne said.

Farmers Grow Vegetables in the Desert Using Solar Energy and Seawater
	
Sundrop Farms is located in the South Australian desert, fully operating on solar energy and desalinated seawater. All the vegetables are grown in greenhouses, standing in a pretty lonely place.?
Construction of the farm is the result of the research group of enthusiasts who wanted to find a way to grow crops where there is no fresh water, suitable soil and power lines. Researchers believe that it is time to get used to growing food in these conditions, because of clean water and good soil is becoming a scarce resource.
In conventional green houses used for irrigating fresh water, electricity for lighting and maintenance of a certain temperature, often fed gas for space heating, but what if all of these facilities not accessible? Here is the solution: solar panels produce enough energy to maintain a favourable temperature for the plants, and at the same time helping to feed the plant, processing salt water into fresh water. After that, it is already possible to easily water the future tasty and healthy tomatoes and many other vegetables and grains!
Solar energy obtained from the solar panels, which follow the sun during the day. From the energy produced help to heat the oil tank, The temperature will go up to 160 degrees Celsius and evaporate the salt water. The by-product steam is used for heating green houses and electricity production, which is required including for the desalination plant, which was added to the watering nutrients.
More three years ago, the founders of the farm could only dream about today's results, but even then their crops could be called impressive by the end of the second year of the first tonne of vegetables grown on the farm. Now, in the greenhouse grows to 17 tonnes of the crop.?
Sundrop Farms has used a clever system to grow food using unlikely ingredients?but is the idea likely to catch on?

GK depositors losing confidence
	
A group of Golden Key depositors said the confidence they had on the Central Bank is waning because it had failed to fully execute its plans to repay all the troubled finance company depositors within the stipulated time-frame.
The repayment plan proposed by Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake was to repay 41 per cent of the amount originally deposited in the Golden Key Credit Card Company Limited (GKCCC) depositors in four stages.
The depositors said they are clueless as to how the final payment was to be made even two months after the deadline expired.
The CB had informed the Supreme Courts on August 4, 2015 that the final installment to depositors with deposits of more than Rs.10 million, was to be completed by August 4, 2016.
The relevant authorities have informed the depositors as to what was happening.
The members of the Golden Key Depositors? Association are known to have written to CBSL Governor Indrajith Coomaraswamy on September 27 highlighting situation and urging him to take immediate action. However, the letter copied to the Attorney General?s Department, the Finance Minister and Treasury Secretary R.H.S. Samaratunge is yet to be acknowledged.
Speaking to Mirror Business, Golden Key Depositors? Association President Vasantha Goonaratne said the members were growing nervous that given the country?s revenue status, they understand it is possible for the payment to be further delayed or worse might remain unpaid.
?We understand that the reserves are tight. But we were promised and that too through the Supreme Court. Adding to our worry is the authorities keeping mum on the repayments. Not a word about the lapsed deadline or anything for that matter. Even our letters are not acknowledged,? a depositor said
He said the lack of any information by the authorities would only lead to the association taking ?stern action? via the Supreme Court.
?If they require more time, they can tell us so. Ignoring is and keeping us in the dark is not the answer,? the depositor said.
When Mirror Business was unable to obtain a response from the Central Bank's Department of Supervision of Non-Banking Financial institutions.
Defunct GKCCC completed the repayments of depositors with deposits up to Rs.10 million. The final batch of cheques cleared by the auditors was posted on January 29. (Shabiya Ali Ahlam)

However, the work under the restructuring plan has failed to kick off for want of funds for the purpose and this has crippled the functioning of several divisions of the Ministry which had to be moved out to make way for the proposed renovation work.

ISIS' territory has shrunk by 16% to the size of SL: Research
	
The amount of territory controlled by the Islamist militant group, the so-called Islamic State (ISIS), has shrunk by 16 percent so far this year, according to new research from IHS Markit.
Research by the organization showed that the group is losing more of its territory ? which it calls a caliphate, or religious state ? year-on-year.
In 2015, the Islamic State's caliphate shrunk from 90,800 square kilometres to 78,000 sq kilometres, a net loss of 14 percent. Then in the first nine months of 2016, that territory shrunk again by a further 16 percent.
As of October 3 2016, the Islamic State controlled roughly 65,500 sq kilometres in Iraq and Syria, which is roughly the size of Sri Lanka, IHS Markit noted.
The last time IHS' Conflict Monitor assessed the size of ISIS' territory on July 4, it controlled an area the size of Ireland, or roughly 68,300 sq kilometres.
?The origins of ISIS are not clear cut, with the group one of several burgeoning Islamic militant movements in the Middle East in the 21st century. In 2014, however, the group took control of swathes of territory in Iraq and Syria, taking advantage of sectarian divides and popular dissatisfaction with the ruling regimes in both countries.
?The group now has affiliates around the world and governs according to strict Islamic doctrine. It has suffered a number of significant losses this year such as the loss of Ramadi, Fallujah and Palmyra. It still maintains the strongholds of Raqqa and Mosul, however.
The U.S.-led coalition of western forces targeting ISIS with airstrikes are not acting alone with Iraqi forces, the Syrian army and a myriad of rebel groups on the ground a central part of the strategy to defeat the group.
In August, the Pentagon announced that ISIS was "on the retreat" and that the number of fighters it could call on ? estimated then to be around 20,000 ? was on the decline. That, combined with the latest research from IHS Markit, suggests that there in progress in the battle against ISIS.
"The Islamic State's territorial losses since July are relatively modest in scale, but unprecedented in their strategic significance," said Columb Strack, senior analyst and head of the IHS Conflict Monitor.
"The loss of direct road access to cross-border smuggling routes into Turkey severely restricts the group's ability to recruit new fighters from abroad, while the Iraqi government is poised to launch its offensive on Mosul." That offensive is expected to begin around October 19. (cnbc)

New system to detect speeding vehicles on expressways
	
Steps were being taken to establish a speed detector system at the Southern and Katunayake Expressways so that the speeding drivers could be fined at the exit points, Expressway Operation, Maintenance and Management Division Director S. Opanayaka said today.
He said the steps were taken to minimize the increasing number of accidents on the expressways involving speeding vehicles.
Mr. Opanayaka said most of the accidents reported on the expressways during the last three months had been caused by speeding vehicles.
?Even though the speed limit on the expressways had been limited to 100 kmph, it is reported that most of the vehicles violate the restriction. We do not have a sufficient number of speed detectors at present and they do not have a night vision facility to function at night,? he said.
He said the new system would be operational round the clock as they were equipped with night vision and added that speeding drivers would be given a spot fine at the exit point.
?According to the new system, the errant drivers would be given a video clip of the over speeding vehicle at the exit point and no one would be able to escape. The Expressway Police would be trained to use the new system,? he said.
Mr. Opanayaka said the new system would be in place within the next two months and added that the initial test would be done at the end of this month.
?We will be able to install the system within two months time. Procurement procedures are in the final stage,? he said. (Ajith Siriwardana)

Queen is company; her retinue a crowd
	
?
This lady holding a very high office in a provincial body exercising decentralized power is often invited to numerous ceremonies, official functions as well as social events held in high-end hotels. And she has made it a practice to attend such events with a large retinue, they say.
?
The large following that accompanies the lady have no specific duty devolved on them except to boost her ego and the those playing host to the lady have to wine and dine them incurring heavy expenses. Therefore, some people think twice before inviting the lady to the functions they organize because of their reluctance to entertain the inevitable group of unwanted guests who accompany her, say the informed sources from the Central province. Queen is company; her retinue a crowd?

Samsung suspends worldwide sales of Galaxy Note 7
	
Samsung has withdrawn all of its Galaxy Note 7 smartphones from sale globally after a spate of fires involving ?safe? replacements.
In a statement issued late Monday, Samsung said consumers with original Note 7 devices or replacements they obtained after the recall should turn off the power and seek a refund or exchange them for different phones.
South Korean authorities said they had found a new product defect in the Note 7 ? Samsung?s most popular smartphone ? and also asked consumers to power them down or to exchange them. The statement did not identify the defect.
The company?s shares dropped 7.5%, the biggest daily percentage decline since 2008, wiping more than $18m off its value.

SLC to reject ?Big Three?
	
Ahead of the ICC Board meeting in Cape Town this week, Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) chief Thilanga Sumathipala said they will not support any move to bring back the ?Big Three? module. Sumathipala will leave to South Africa today to attend the board meeting.
The national boards of England, India and Australia were responsible for a radical overhaul of cricket?s world governing body, which included increased shares of global revenue for all three and powerful positions on a newly-formed executive committee.? ?
But this was shot down in February this year as ICC removed the so-called ?big three? from permanent positions on the executive committee and finance and commercial affairs committee. ?
However Indian newspapers yesterday reported that BCCI?the Board of Control for Cricket in India?will campaign to get the ?Big Three? module back in the fray during the three-day meeting. ?
?We certainly do not endorse this idea of entering the common revenue pool. Also the idea of Big Three must be revived and BCCI is having active discussions in this regard with ECB and CA,? Economic Times newspaper quoted a BCCI official as saying. ?
However, Sumathipala said SLC will not back any move in this regard. ?
??As far as ?Big Three? we have always been against it. Cricket has to be equal. Equity has to be distributed equally among all members. We have nothing to do with big three at the moment and we have to maintain our position very clearly in this regard,? Sumathipala said. ?
Sri Lanka was one of the two nations which did not support the ?Big Three? move when it was introduced in 2014.? ?But I must tell you we are very concerned about the stability and the independence of BCCI given the current development of the board,? he added. (Champika Fernando)

Technology-driven banking will be critical driver of future industry growth: HNB CEO
	
This is the fifth interview under the Mirror Business S&P SL20 Insights series where top CEOs of the companies in the S&P SL20 index are interviewed. The interview series is done in collaboration with the Colombo Stock Exchange. Following are the excerpts of an interview with Hatton National Bank MD/CEO Jonathan Alles.
?
What key milestones has the Bank achieved during 2016?
It has been a record-breaking year for HNB during which we have been able to demonstrate outstanding improvements across all of key performance indicators. During the first 6 months of 2016, HNB group was able to achieve a PBT and PAT in excess of Rs. 10 billion and Rs. 7 billion respectively.?
Our group?s excellent results were mirrored by a strong performance from the Bank which posted a PBT of Rs 9.1 billion and a PAT of Rs 6.4 billion respectively. Similarly, HNB was able to successfully drive down NPA ratio to 2.25 percemt in 2016, reflecting an overall 100 bps improvement when compared with our results in June 2015 while our cost-to-income ratio has also come down to the lowest levels in HNB?s history.?
During the same period, we have also made significant progress in terms of securing investments into the Bank following the recent approval by our Board of Directors for an equity investment worth approximately US$ 50 million from the Asian Development Bank (ADB). This investment is of course subject to regulatory and shareholder approval and will require the issuance of new shares that will lead to ADB holding a 9 percent ? 10 percent stake in the Bank. This is a truly landmark transaction for HNB and it will serve to substantially boost our Tier I Capital position and improve the Bank?s overall risk profile while opening up many new avenues for growth both locally and regionally.
In that regard, this fresh infusion of capital will also help to further refine HNB?s robust risk management framework and drive a comprehensive digital transformation process across our Bank and branch-network and enable business process re-engineering initiatives that will draw from the ADB?s extensive technical assistance programme.?
HNB was also able to successfully raise Rs. 7 billion in funding by way of a subordinated debenture issue which was successfully concluded in early 2016 having been oversubscribed on the date of issue. This has further augmented our Tier II capital base.?
We have also made substantial progress in relation to the upgrade of HNB?s electronic banking platform. These improvements have enabled the Bank to offer unmatched payment and cash management, distributor financing and online trade financing propositions.?
Another significant milestone during this period was when HNB was recognized as the ?Best Retail Bank in Sri Lanka? for the 8th time by the prestigious ?Asian Banker?. This award represents an acknowledgment of our unparalleled commitment to serving more our customer base of over two million Sri Lankans and in recognition of the consolidated leadership position we continue to enjoy in the retail banking space. Furthermore HNB was bestowed with the ?Silver Award? for ?Best Investor Relations? at the CFA Sri Lanka Capital Market Awards 2016 in recognition of our efforts in shareholder engagement, governance and transparency.
?
What are the growth prospects prevalent in the financial services industry?
Overall we remain highly confident of growth prospects in the financial services industry despite the highly competitive nature of the Sri Lankan industry.?
The government has geared its efforts towards driving sustainable, broad-based economic growth in Sri Lanka and naturally, the financial services industry will have a vital role to play in driving such growth. Given the more recent revival of infrastructure development programmes by the government, which are paralleled by similar private sector-led developments in addition to plans for the development of the Megapolis project, we believe that outlook for the financial services industry remains very promising. As a result of such developments, we see strong opportunities for growth in terms of infrastructure funding, and equally importantly, in relation to funding the growth and expansion of SMEs and micro entrepreneurs.
We also anticipate a growth in Foreign Direct Investment (FDIs) into Sri Lanka flowing from the formation of economic zones, industrial parks and the various initiatives being set in place to drive value added exports. All of these factors hold the potential to significantly boost Sri Lanka?s export sector and augur well for the medium to long-term economic stability of the country.?
In that context, it is our opinion that technology-driven banking will be a critical driver of growth in our industry moving forward. Sri Lankans are becoming increasingly tech and brand savvy and the usage of digital media among millennials is creating new opportunities for banks to engage and interact with new customer demographics. This is a phenomenon that is already being witnessed around the globe and it is based on these dynamics that HNB is re-aligning itself to be future-ready in order to better serve the needs of a new generation of customers.?
In that context however, it must be said that consolidation within the industry must also be re-visited. Particularly when considering the anticipated establishment of an international finance centre in Colombo, we believe that banks need to explore such strategies in order to build the financial capacity necessary to compete in regional markets.
?
How does the Bank intend to capitalize on these growth opportunities?
To begin with, I would have to say that HNB?s well-established presence across all market segments and our position as one of the premier banks in Sri Lanka provide an excellent foundation from which to capture new growth opportunities.?
However we also aim to go beyond these strong fundamentals. By leveraging our market leadership position in corporate banking, the strength of our balance sheet, numerous technological advancements and superior service delivery, we will work to finance many of Sri Lanka?s most vital infrastructure developments while providing support to large-scale investments for the private sector as well. Backed by the concerted efforts of our dedicated and experienced ARMs, we are extremely confident that HNB will be able to capture an even larger share of the market in the year to come.?
Conversely, we will also continue to channel substantial resources into Sri Lanka?s Micro, Small and Medium (MSME) sector. HNB has been a true pioneer in this field having partnered the SME segment from its inception and having continued to add value through our service proposition. In that regard, we have been able to offer significant improvements in our proposition by introducing new functionalities such as distributor and supplier financing while driving faster delivery through initiatives such as regionalization of SME credit. ?
HNB has been active in the microfinance business for nearly 30 years through our flagship ?Gami Pubuduwa? programme, which incidentally represents the first such foray in the sector by a commercial bank in Sri Lanka and this has over time provided the Bank with invaluable insights and unparalleled experience in the sector. Our leading position across all those segments was considerably strengthened by the acquisition of HNB Grameen (earlier Prime Grameen) which is a very successful micro finance business catering to the grass roots of the segment. Hence we are once again extremely well positioned to be at the forefront of revolution in Sri Lanka?s MSME sector.
On the technology front, we pride ourselves on being the most future-ready Bank in Sri Lanka. HNB has invested significantly in its ?New World Banking? concept, involving the roll out of many first-to-market technology-led banking channels and products.
In the recent past, we launched a cutting-edge mobile banking platform in four different flavours, mobile POS solution in the form of HNB MOMO, a cardless ?Inland Remittances? solution, a highly sophisticated and specialized series of ATMs including bulk cash deposit machines, bill payment kiosks and recyclers to name a few. The Bank is therefore very well positioned to avail itself of the opportunities that the digital revolution brings and we will continue to invest in state-of-the-art technologies in order to further consolidate our technology leadership position.
By leveraging on these alternate technology-led channels in addition to our wide spread brick-and-mortar network of 250 branches island-wide, and the comprehensive range of products and services, we anticipate that the Bank will be able to better serve the personal financial needs of retail clients across the country.?
?
In your opinion, what challenges do you anticipate in the financial services industry going forward, especially when taking global factors into consideration?
There are a few factors that need to be considered when looking at the current global context. The impending elections in the US and Brexit are two key events that increase global uncertainty leading to volatility in exchange rates with notable implications for many emerging and frontier markets including Sri Lanka and its banking industry.?
In the event of a rate increase by the US Federal Reserve, foreign investors are likely to seek higher yields and possibly consider moving out of emerging and frontier markets. This would result in limitations to sourcing debt capital from foreign sources at attractive rates, ultimately exerting pressure on the loan-deposit ratio of Banks.?
Furthermore with the drying up of international borrowings, the government will have to resort to leveraging greater domestic funding, which in turn could result in volatility across domestic interest rates. Nevertheless, the government?s commitment to bring down the interest rates over the medium to long term will result in narrowing of interest margins.?
In an environment of uncertainty, FDI?s into the country could also be deferred, thus hampering the country?s growth prospects and consequently that of the country?s financial services sector.?
More generally, the rapid evolution of technology, changes in customer lifestyles and preferences and the digital disruption being created by telcos and fintechs could serve to create unprecedented new dynamics in the financial services sector while the threat of cyber-attacks could also pose a serious challenge to financial services companies both locally and globally in future.?
With regard to the local environment, at present there is a shortage of required talent while retention and overseas migration of talent have been key challenges faced by the industry. I also believe that the changing mindset of the emerging labour force in relation to long term vs short term employment will pose a major threat going forward.?
?
What is your assessment on the readiness of your organization to meet these challenges?
HNB?s ability to meet these challenges stem from our financial strength, business model and strategic direction. In that context, it must be noted that HNB continues to attract substantial investments, which was touched upon earlier.?
In 2015, HNB raised US$ 185 million from multilateral institutions and DFIs at attractive rates and in early 2016 the Bank raised Rs. 7 billion by way of a listed debenture issue. Nevertheless deposits are the key source of funding and mobilization of deposits especially low cost deposits (current accounts and savings accounts ? CASA) remain one of our key focus areas. A number of strategies are already in place to strengthen our CASA base while the transaction that we will be entering into with the ADB will also open up more opportunities for HNB to source funding.?
With regard to movement in local interest rates, majority of our loan book being on variable terms will minimize our exposure to interest rate volatility.?
Meanwhile, we will also work to address the challenge of compressing margins through a continuous effort to improve fee income, aggressive recovery of loans installments due, and stringent management of costs in order to drive a leaner and more agile organisation.
As I mentioned previously, continuous investments into the latest technological innovations will play a key role. Similarly we will also continue to drive business growth and further refine our risk management processes to identify and mitigate local and global risks.
?
What efforts and initiatives have the Bank taken to drive shareholder value?
The maximization of shareholder value is of utmost importance to HNB and our approach in this regard is two-fold. Firstly we strive to deliver superior returns as reflected by our above average ROAs and ROEs. These returns drive the share price and thereby capital gains for investors while we consistently pay out high dividends.?
The main initiatives undertaken to drive ROAs and ROEs include prudent assets and liability management, business process reengineering (BPR) and aggressively driving down NPAs through continuous improvement in underwriting standards and intensifying the focus on recoveries.?
With regard to BPR initiatives, in 2013 the Bank set up a dedicated BPR unit to drive process efficiency, and this led to ?centralization and stream lining of several ?back office functions thereby releasing resources. As a result we have been successful in improving the Bank?s cost to income ratio by nearly 800 bps from the levels recorded in 2012.
Secondly, we also deliver implicit investor value in terms of our governance efforts where we ensure transparency and regulatory compliance of the highest degree. A robust risk management function further aids our governance function while also serving to enhance our reputation as a safe, secure and high performing Bank. In that context, the proposed investment by the ADB will enable us to drive further improvements on this front.?
?
How has listing on the CSE been beneficial to HNB?
The listing on the CSE in the early 1970s has proven to be highly beneficial to HNB in multiple ways. Today, HNB is one of the largest market cap companies on the stock exchange while also being listed on the S&P SL 20 index. This has naturally played an important role in elevating our status in the eyes of both local and foreign investors. As a result, the top 20 shareholders of the Bank presently consist of foreign institutional investors holding nearly 13 percent of our voting capital. ?
The listing on the CSE while broad basing the shareholder base over the years has enabled improvement in our governance standards and disclosure requirements thereby enabling the investors make informed decisions. As a result we have been able to raise funds successfully on many occasions through public issues of debt and equity to bridge the funding gap.
