BRAC Lanka Finance PLC, the LOLC group?s newest addition to its microfinance sector, recently opened its first regional office at E.M.W. Jayasooriya Mawatha, Nupe, Matara. ?
BRAC?s first regional office is equipped with modern service facilities and is driven by a team of highly experienced and dedicated personnel.?
Last year, Commercial Leasing Company PLC, a group company of LOLC, acquired BRAC Lanka Finance. Catering to the lowest end of the micro lending segment in the country, BRAC is renowned as Sri Lanka?s only microfinance company with the highest level of female participation. BRAC?s total client base of 160,000 comprises entirely of female borrowers whilst 93 percent of its staff members are female.?
Furthermore, the field operations are completely handled by BRAC?s female staff. Through a large network of service centres scattered throughout many rural areas of the island, BRAC steers ahead with its primary objective of empowering women. The company focuses on lending exclusively to women entrepreneurs who are engaged in self-employment, manufacturing, trade and service providing.?
Speaking at the opening ceremony of BRAC?s first regional office in Matara, Group Managing Director and CEO Kapila Jayawardena, who participated as the chief guest said, ?BRAC has the potential to further enrich the group?s microfinance vision through its unique business model by penetrating more into the business activities of female entrepreneurs in the bottom layer of the pyramid across the country.??
Sharing his thoughts, BRAC Lanka Finance PLC Deputy CEO Rohana Kumara said, ?This is just the beginning of our expansion plans. In addition to expanding our footprint, we hope to introduce a new IT system which will enable us to expand our product portfolio to our female borrowers. Currently we offer group loans and leasing facilities but in the very near future we hope to provide urban microfinance loans, individual loans, development loans as well as home improvement loans.??
LOLC Group Chief Executive Branch Network Ashan Nissanka, other senior management members and staff members of LOLC and BRAC, as well as customers were present during the ceremonial activities that took place at the Matara regional office opening. Central Bank Regional Manager Matara Regional Office Upali Hettiarachchi also attended the ceremonial opening.?
Driven by a unique and sustainable business model, BRAC intends to offer its clientele a range of other meaningful, value-added services such as training and knowledge enhancement sessions, literacy improvement workshops and marketing and sales training and basic knowledge in book keeping. Together with its sister company LOLC Insurance, BRAC also plans to introduce a micro insurance scheme to mitigate the risks faced by its borrowers.?
Backed by LOLC?s extensive experience in the micro credit business and with the support of international agencies, BRAC hopes to introduce industry best practices to reinforce its unique business model and thereby ensure the sustainable improvement of the less privileged rural communities it caters to.?

Mirror Business spoke to Cargills Bank AGM Corporate Banking and SME Palan Rajanathan regarding the bank and its services. Following are the excerpts of the interview.
Can you speak of what the bank offers to your business customers?
Cargills Bank offers a range of business banking solutions to small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and larger corporate customers. Within our product range, trade services have been at the forefront of offerings by Cargills Bank to its clients since the inception of the bank over one year ago. We also provide general working capital financing and term financing for businesses. We are pleased to have already assisted businesses in expanding their operations within the short span of time we have been conducting banking business.
How has the bank been able to assist SMEs??
We noted a significant interest rate variation on borrowings between larger corporate names and other customers. We focused and provided immediate financial benefits through lower cost financing and services to medium-sized and smaller enterprises. Our aim is to provide interest rates and services that meet the needs of these customers which will make these companies competitive and that will enable both of us to grow. We have also recently started invoice discounting which provides a cheaper alternative to factoring.
Our deposit rates are also attractive and Cargills Bank Limited is able to give customers a better return on their excess funds which has been appreciated by our customers.
In terms of trade services what is the value addition that you provide?
No matter the size of the customer or where they do business, we work with our clients to make a difference in their business both in terms of cost and services and our experienced trade team goes the extra mile and provides advice and necessary training to the client?s staff if required. The bank?s trade management team includes subject matter expert trainers with wide experience in international banking and trade finance in Sri Lanka as well as overseas. The bank visits the customers regularly to discuss their business needs and tries and understand their requirements. Our exchange rates on trade transactions are also very competitive and this has been acknowledged and valued by our customers.
Do you require properties as security to take working capital facilities?

Gunawardane told the Daily Mirror there was agreement during the last Parliament to appoint MPs without Cabinet posts to the CC.
He said the President, and the Prime Minister had appointed Cabinet Ministers as their nominees.

Floating armoury: Gota says CID probed charges properly
	
	Former Defence Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa said a thorough inquiry was conducted by the Criminal Investigations Department (CID) into the floating armoury belonging to the Avant Garde Company and it had come to the conclusion that there was no illegality or even procedural infirmity in his actions.
	?People who did not know about the work of the company and the international context in which Sri Lanka created a floating armory and Sea Marshals, made allegations. I was against a witch hunt but wanted the charges to be probed properly, which the CID did,? Mr. Rajapaksa told the Indian Express.
	He said the anti-piracy company was set up at the request of the United Nations and Avant Garde did a good job eliciting praise and earning a lot of foreign exchange for Sri Lanka.
	The government on Monday told the Colombo Additional Magistrate that it does not want to proceed with the ?floating armoury? case in which Gotabaya Rajapaksa, former Defense Secretary and brother of ex-President Mahinda Rajapaksa, is involved.
	Magistrate Nishantha Peiris terminated the case after the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) informed him that, on the advice of the Attorney General, it did not wish to pursue it.
	After the Presidential election on January 8 in which Mahinda Rajapaksa was defeated, police seized the floating armory and more than 3,000 automatic weapons in 20 containers at Galle port.
	The armoury was run by a private security firm, Avant Garde Maritime Services (Pvt) Ltd. Avant Garde was in a joint venture with the Defense Ministry-owned Rakna Lanka Ltd., which was in the business of providing Sea Marshals to ships operating in the piracy-infested seas off Somalia and the Gulf.
	To ruling party leaders, almost everything about the Rakna Lanka-Avant Garde deal was tainted or suspicious. They charged that the Sea Marshals could well have been used at election time. The Maithripala Sirisena government promptly asked a Presidential Commission on high corruption to go into the allegations.

Hands free causes more accidents: Report
	
	Using Bluetooth headset while driving increased the chances of accidents by 75 percent, a senior officer at the Police Traffic Headquarters said.
	He said people were more vigilant when using phones, while driving or crossing roads but careless when they used Bluetooth headsets.
	A Parliamentary sub-committee had been appointed last year to look into the measures to prevent road accidents and it had suggested that Bluetooth headsets and lack of back seat belts had caused more accidents, injuries and deaths during the past years.
	?We won?t ban the use of Bluetooth headsets, unless a directive came through Parliament.
	?However, the 351 clause of the publication by Parliament sub-committee, which convened on 2014 December 12 had suggested the use of Bluetooth headsets cause more accidents,? he said.
	Meanwhile, acting Police Spokesman SSP Priyantha Jayakody said they had still not taken measures to ban the use of the devices or to implement the use of back seat belts as Parliament had not yet recommended to do so. (LSP and SD)

No one can topple government: President
	
	Whatever said and done by political opponents, the government would rule the country for the next five years without any hiccup to meet the targets set by UNP-SLFP led consensual government, President Maithripala Sirisena said today.
	?Some opposition members expect that the government is short-lived based on the results of the elections. Their thinking is that days are numbered for this government and must be toppled before long. I must tell them that this government will go for its full term of five years,? President Sirisena said at the swearing in ceremony of State, and Deputy Ministers at the Presidential Secretariat.
	He reminded a similar statement made by late Prime Minister S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike after he won the 1956 Parliamentary elections and appealed to his political adversaries not to try to give birth to a child before he or she completes their full term in the womb enabling a healthy child birth.
	?Here were criticism, insults, bitter abuse and brickbats levelled at the government from its very inception. They said a patriotic government has been replaced in a conspiracy hatched by the Western and Imperial powers with a government that danced to the tune of the West.
	?Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and I are ready to answer to those allegations in the future. I must tell them that this government would never bow down to any foreign power or succumb to any pressure as we have a tradition, culture and civilization we can look up to.
	?We would never intend to put a black mark on that great history to the day we breathe our last,? President Sirisena emphasized.
	President Sirisena said that all four religions practiced in Sri Lanka teach reconciliation, brotherhood and compassion and that the people must decide what was good for them.
	?They must realise the importance of unity, love and understanding. We can?t go forward any more without unity and mutual understanding between each other. The National Unity Government has targeted to make Sri Lanka the Centre of Excellence in Asia in the next five years through a common and uninterrupted programme. The two-year National Unity Government will show us whether the journey we started would be a success or not,? he said.
	President Sirisena said the selection of Cabinet Ministers, State Ministers and Deputy Ministers was not an easy task and Prime Minister Wickremesinghe had spent several sleepless nights and the situation was difficult as he had to pick ministers and deputy ministers from different political parties.

Politicians must make sacrifices-Ranil
	
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe yesterday said politicians must make sacrifices if they genuinely want to serve the people. He said cabinet ministers, state ministers and deputy ministers had concluded the first phase of the National Unity Government in its journey to make Sri Lanka the ?Center of Excellence? in the next five years.
Speaking at the ceremony held at the Presidential Secretariat to mark the swearing in of state ministers and deputy ministers before President Maithripala Sirisena, Mr. Wickremesinghe said that all ministers, state ministers and deputy ministers must now spring into action to deliver what the UNP and the SLFP promised the people during the election campaign.
?The formation of the consensual government led by the UNP and supported by the SLFP is a revolution. A revolution because this is the first time in the political history of Sri Lanka that he two major political parties signed an MoU and agreed to serve the people in unity and co-operation. Now we are determined to do our best to lessen the burdens of our people and bring a smile of contentment and happiness to their faces at least within the next two years. This is not something unusual or unbelievable, as many Commonwealth countries have adopted this theory of consensual politics to take their countries more speedily towards progress, reconciliation and peace; and they have been successful,? he said.
Mr. Wickremesinghe said the consensual government comprising the UNP and the SLFP was an attempt to see how both parties could cooperate to give the best to the people by putting their politics aside for some time.
Not only the UNP and the SLFP, but also the TNA and other political parties and, in short, all the members of parliament could become stakeholders in this ambitious endeavour aimed at facing the world with courage and respect, he said.
Mr. Wickremesinghe appealed to the ministers and deputy ministers to remain in parliament during sessions to answer questions, as the government was committed to successfully end the ?Yahapalana? journey begun on January 8 by President Sirisena .
He told them that endless foreign trips would deflect their attention from the people and, therefore, it would be appropriate if they restricted their foreign travel to a manageable level. He said President Sirisena had made a major sacrifice to change the political structure of the country for good and their responsibility was to give the benefits of that sacrifice to the people and the future generations.
