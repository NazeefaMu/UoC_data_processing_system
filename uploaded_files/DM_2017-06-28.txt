A fool enters where angels fear to tread
	

A former high political authority recently received an invitation from a friendly South Asian country  to be more specific, our friendly neighbours not so friendly neighbour  to deliver a special talk at an event at the countrys defence university.

On hearing about the invitation extended to the former political authority, a certain purohita went into a flutter. He wanted to express the governments displeasure over this invitation to the guest countrys envoy based in Colombo. However, more mature political authorities advised the purohita to drop the idea saying that it was undiplomatic on their part to intervene in this matter.
Ignoring the sane counsel given to him, the purohita called the foreign envoy and told him that it would be advisable for them to call off the proposed visit by the former strongman because it could be construed as an affront to the powers that be in yahapalanaya.
The diplomat who calmly listened to this unusual request had reportedly replied that the invitation had come from the highest echelons in his country and there was nothing he could do about it.
So the purohita had to accept defeat with egg on his face.

A scam was busted by CID
	
A group of 25 Nigerian and Ugandan nationals had been rounded up recently by the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) for swindling a sum of Rs.50 million from over 15 locals through fake Facebook posts.
Police Media Spokesman SP Ruwan Gunasekara stated yesterday that these foreigners were arrested by the CID on charges of financial fraud.
Mr. Gunasekara said the CID launched an investigation following 15 complaints they had received from countrywide, where the complainants had claimed that the said group posing as a cash bonanza scheme had directed them to deposit certain amounts of cash as taxes.
They had approached the complainants saying that they had won a big cash prize and to claim it they have to pay a certain percentage of the prize as taxes and postal charges to the Ministry of Finance.
Also the group had cited several bank accounts to deposit the required amounts where the locals had done so. The racketeers had then reportedly withdrawn those amounts amounting to Rs.50 million and disappeared.
The bank accounts to which the locals had deposited the money had been operated by a group of Sri Lankans who were tricked by the foreigners to scandalous operation. The remitted money had been withdrawn by the fraudsters.
The Police Spokesman warned the general public not to be deceived by those involved in such cyber crimes. Mr. Gunasekara also requested the public to be vigilant when using Facebook and other Social Media sites, especially when dealing with unknown friends on those sites. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

A young politico between two worlds!
	

There is a young upcoming Diyawanna member hailing from the South. His father too was a prominent politico who once held purohita status.

This young member, a JO group faithful, had made a big fuss in the group when the former strongman attended a public function in his electorate without informing him in advance. The young member who took this incident as an affront to him, had avoided visiting the strongmans political office thereafter. 
Meanwhile, a rumour spread that a Green party stalwart from the South had hooked the young member. The rumour apart, he had received feelers from several Green party high-ups as well.
Later the member had done a sample survey of the general opinion of the voters in his electorate. The results of this survey are not known. But a rumour says that the young member is struggling between two minds over taking his next political plunge. Meanwhile, some of the members pals have advised him to visit the Devundara Devale to seek guidance from Upulvan deity, they say.

Breast cancer
	

Breast cancer is a type of cancer developing in breast cells. Breast cancer usually begins in the inner lining of milk ducts or lobules supplying milk. A breast cancer that starts off in the lobules is known as lobular carcinoma, while one that developed from the ducts is called ductal carcinoma. It should also be noted that a malignant tumour can spread to other parts of the body. Daily Mirror spoke to Consultant Oncologist Dr. Jayantha Balawardene on how breast cancer forms and spreads. 
Breast cancer is the most common cancer among females globally and in Sri Lanka. Though breast cancer is more common in women, it is also present in men. There are many factors that lead to the occurrence of breast cancer; the most common being genetics. It also occurs among unmarried women, childless women and those who have their first child after the age of 30 or during early puberty and late menopause. 

The anatomy of a female breast
A mature human females breast consists of fat, connective tissue and thousands of lobules [tiny glands which produce milk]. The milk of a breast-feeding mother goes through tiny ducts [tubes] and is delivered through the nipple. 
The breast, like any other part of the body, consists of billions of microscopic cells. These cells multiply in an orderly fashion. New cells are made to replace those that die. 
In a cancer, cells multiply uncontrollably and progressively. Cancer beginning in the lactiferous duct, known as the ductal carcinoma, is the most common type. Cancer beginning in the lobules, known as lobular carcinoma, is much less common

Symptoms of breast cancer

Symptoms are felt by the patient and the first of these are usually an area of thickened tissue in the womans breast, or a lump. The majority of lumps are not cancerous; however women should get them checked by a healthcare professional.

Some of the symptoms of breast cancer:

A lump in the breast 
	Pain in the armpits or breast that dont seem to be related to the womans menstrual period 
	Pitting or redness of skin in the breast resembling the skin of an orange 
	Rash around [or on] one of the nipples 
	Swelling [lump] in one of the armpits 
	Area of thickened tissue in the breast 
	A nipple discharge that may contain blood 
	The nipple changes appearance, may become sunken or inverted 
	The size or shape of the breast changes 
	The skin of the breast or nipple may start to peel, scale or flake 
	

Causes of breast cancer
Genetics 
Women who have a close relative who has/had breast or ovarian cancer are more likely to develop the disease. Women who carry the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes have a considerably higher risk of developing breast or ovarian cancer. 
Having had certain types of breast lumps 
Women who have had some types of benign [non-cancerous] breast lumps are more likely to develop cancer later on 
Dense breast tissue 
Women with denser breast tissue have a greater chance of developing breast cancer 
Estrogen exposure 
Women who menstruated early or entered menopause later than usual have a higher risk of developing breast cancer, as their bodies are exposed to estrogen for a longer period of time.
Obesity 
Post-menopausal obese and overweight women may have a higher risk of developing breast cancer. 
Height 
Taller-than-average women have a slightly greater likelihood of developing breast cancer. 

Alcohol consumption 
The more a woman drinks, the higher her risk of getting breast cancer. 
Radiation exposure 
Undergoing X-rays and CT scans may increase the risk of breast cancer 
HRT [Hormone Replacement Therapy] 
Both forms, combined and estrogen only HRT therapies may increase a womans risk of developing breast cancer slightly. 
There are two types of breast cancer known as Invasive and Non-invasive breast cancer. 


Invasive breast cancer
The cancer cells break out from inside the lobules or ducts and invade nearby tissue. With this type of cancer, the abnormal cells can reach the lymph nodes and eventually make their way to other organs (metastasis), such as the bones, liver or lungs. 

Non-invasive breast cancer
This is when the cancer is still in its place of origin and has not broken out. Lobular carcinoma in situ is when the cancer is still inside the lobules, while ductal carcinoma in situ is when they are still inside the milk ducts. In situ means in its original place. 

Diagnosing breast cancer

Women are usually diagnosed with breast cancer after a routine breast cancer screening or after detecting certain signs and symptoms. 
Breast exam 
	X-ray [mammogram 
	2D combined with 3D mammograms 
	Breast ultra sound 
	Biopsy 
	Breast MRI [Magnetic Resonance Imagining Scan] 

Breast cancer staging
Staging describes the extent of the cancer in the patients body and is based on whether it is invasive or non-invasive, how large the tumour is, whether lymph nodes are involved and how many and whether it has metastasised [spread to other parts of the body]. 
A cancers stage is a crucial factor in deciding what treatment options to recommend and in determining the patients prognosis. Staging is done after cancer is diagnosed. To do the staging, the doctor may order several different tests including blood tests, a mammogram, a chest x-ray, a bone scan, a CT scan, or a PET scan.

Treatmentsfor breastcancer

Radiation therapy (radiotherapy). Controlled doses of radiation are targeted at the tumour to destroy the cancer cells. There are certain types of Radiotherapy as: 
Breast radiation therapy 
	Chest wall radiation therapy 
	Breast boost 
	Lymph nodes radiation therapy 
	Breast brachy therapy surgery 
There are many surgeries a patient can undergo to reduce breast cancer such as: 
Lumpectomy 
	Mastectomy 
	Sentinel node biopsy 
	Auxiliary lymph node dissection 
	Breast reconstruction surgery Chemotherapy 
Medication used to kill cancer cells are known as Cytotoxuc drugs. The Oncologist may recommend chemotherapy if there is a high risk of cancer recurrence, or if the cancer is spreading elsewhere in the body. This is called adjuvant chemotherapy.
Hormone therapy (hormone blocking therapy) 
Hormone therapy is used for breast cancers sensitive to hormones. The aim is to prevent cancer recurrence. Hormone blocking therapy is normally used after surgery but may sometimes be used beforehand to shrink the tumour.
Biological treatment (targeted drugs) 
	Trastuzumab (Herceptin) 
	Lapatinib (Tykerb) 
	Bevacizumab (Avastin) 
	Low-dose aspirin

## Title: Butter, Margarine or Fat Spread 
## Section: Medicine

Butter, Margarine or Fat Spread 
	

It is a must in our day-to-day cooking and baking. The moistener that most cant imagine a slice of bread without. Whatever you choose, butter or margarine are not items that one easily forgets when shopping for essential groceries.

If butter scores points for taste and margarine for health, then what does fat spread do Have you felt conflicted and confused if you should choose butter or switch to margarine or another spread This week, Health Capsule brings you the answers to your melting questions. 
Butter has been the culinary sweetheart around the world, as it is one of the most highly concentrated forms of fluid milk. Twenty litres of whole milk are needed to produce one kilogram of butter. But over the years, the sacred culinary product has come under great scrutiny, owing to research findings linked with risks of heart disease. Ever since these findings, a fierce debate has raged on among experts debating the amount of saturated fats contained in butter. 
Then came margarine to the rescue. Margarine, a butter substitute made originally from animal fats but now made exclusively from vegetable oils, was seen as the alternative. As nutritionists pointed to the heart-healthy option, margarine was a healthy familys new best friend. However, research on the high levels of trans-fats packed in margarine shed light on doubled risk for heart health, which left many in limbo. 
Along came the fat spread, promising to champion heart health. It looked like margarine, it tasted like margarine. But it was not margarine. Home-bakers found out to their dismay that the rebranding of the popular margarine they used for their cakes was actually the reason that their delicacies didnt turn out quite right. While most Sri Lankan consumers were baffled with the health risks, almost all margarines were re-labelled or reformulated into fat spreads. 

Butter vs Margarine
The type of fat found in butter and margarine is what makes these two products different from each other. Margarine contains plant-based fats while butter is made from dairy fat. The main source of fat in butter would be milk fat which is high in saturated fats. In margarine, the main source of fat will be vegetable fat which can be either high in saturated or unsaturated fatty acids, Registered Dietitian and Nutritionist Nilushi Mudalige said speaking to Health Capsule. 
According to Mudalige, given the choice of butter and margarine, the latter emerges as the healthier option. Margarines are healthier than butter, but it has to be a soft margarine. Fat spreads or margarines made out of canola oil, sunflower oil or olive oil are generally recommended, she said.

How to identify good margarines
Based on the type of vegetable oil that is used to prepare margarine, you can identify them as healthy or unhealthy varieties. How an average person can identify this is by looking at the texture of the margarine in refrigerated temperature. The test is as simple as putting your margarine in the refrigerator. After a while if the margarine is in soft form, it is considered to be healthy. If it has hardened, that means it contains comparatively more unhealthy fat which can increase your bad cholesterol in blood and the risk for cardio vascular diseases  Mudalige explained.

Fat spreads vs margarine
Fat spreads and margarines are both made of vegetable fats. Yet there is a difference in the composition. Margarine is about 80% fat and 20% water, whereas fat spreads are the opposite, containing more water. You can find 80% water in fat spreads with only about 20% fat. Mudalige opined. Asked if there was a regulation on the amount of vegetable oils or fat percentage that could go into a fat spread, the expert nutritionist said professionals favour identifying healthy and unhealthy products and advice consumers accordingly. 

Healthier option
According to Harvard Health Publications, there has never been any proper evidence that using margarine instead of butter can cut the chances of a heart attack or the development of a heart disease. From the standpoint of heart disease, butter is on the list of foods to use sparingly mostly because it is high in saturated fat, which aggressively increases levels of bad cholesterol. 
According to nutritionists, a quick comparison of the health value of spreads (including butter and margarine) simply by looking at the nutrition labels on these products, is enough to keep you well informed. No matter what type of spread you butter your toast with, your goal should be to limit the intake of saturated fats and to avoid trans fats altogether.

Chinese troops enter Sikkim, jostle with Indian forces
	

Chinese troops entered India in the Sikkim sector and jostled with Indian army personnel guarding the Sino-India frontier, destroying two bunkers. 
The face-off has been going on in Doka La general area in Sikkim for the past ten days and the Chinese troops have also stopped the batch of pilgrims that was proceeding for Kailash Mansovar yatra, official sources said on Monday. 
The Indian troops had to struggle hard to stop the Chinese personnel from advancing further into Indian territory. They formed a human wall along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) to stop the PLA personnel, some of whom also videographed and clicked pictures of the incident. 
The Hindustan Times reported it was not the first time that such a transgression has happened at the Doka La, a place at the Sikkim-Bhutan-Tibet
tri-junction.

Crucial decision on the constitution next week: PM
	
The Constitution Assembly Steering Committee will meet next week to decide on the procedure to be adopted when enacting the new constitution, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremeisnghe said today.
He said this when addressing a conference on the new constitution organized by the onstitutional Assembly Secretariat and pointed out that the Steering Committee at its meeting next week would decide whether to include all provisions of the constitution in the interim report or to include only the provisions which did not need a referendum.
Do we include all provisions or do we only include those which do not need a referendum in the steering Committee report This is one of the questions we will debate next week. We are reaching a crucial stage in the consensus building process on the constitution, the Prime Minister said.
"We have decided on an electoral system with 60 per cent under the first-past-the-post system and 40 per cent on the proportional representation system. Some smaller parties have submitted proposals on this matter which we need to discuss. We also have to decide on the legal procedure to be followed if and when the Bills are challenged. The necessary legislation has been decided by Parliament. Have we to transmit this to Supreme Court or are we to have a separate mechanism. There is also an agreement on a senate. How the members are elected and the powers it will have will have to be decided. How are we to exercise executive power in relation to the 13th amendment Executive power will remain with the central government. When we strengthen Parliament we have to decide how to keep the power of the executive during an emergency. We have to discuss these matters in full, he said. There is no provision to take away the prominence given to Buddhism. The question is how to give members of other religions the right of worship, he added.
Mr Moseneke in his address said how an interim constitution was prepared before the preparation and enacting a fully-fledged constitution in that country. Also he related how the rights of minority whites, rights of mixed races and all 11 ethnic groups in South Africa were ensured by South Africa. (Yohan Perera)

Dental Dilemma
	

Query: I am a 20- year-old boy who has been suffering from severe toothache at the back of my upper jaw since of late. It is especially painful when I have my meals and apply pressure on the tooth. For quite a while, I have been suffering from extreme tooth sensitivity also, not having the ability to consume anything that is hot or cold as it becomes very painful. I have also noticed that the tooth in question is discoloured and darkened. I have also noticed a swelling and certain tenderness in the gums near the affected tooth. My gums have also started bleeding when I brush my teeth. I want to know whether these symptoms are leading to a serious problem such as oral cancer. If not, I would like to know the cause of these symptoms. 
(Mihin Gunathilaka from Gampaha) 
Answer: From the symptoms you mention, I can say that it is definitely not oral cancer. For one thing, you complain of pain and sensitivity which is not normally observed in oral cancer patients. Oral cancers are painless in most cases. You also seem to be complaining of the discolouration of the tooth. Cancers dont normally form inside teeth, causing discolouration. In the case of oral cancer, the surrounding tissues and gums get affected externally. The symptoms you mentioned are more likely to be those of a carious tooth condition, where it has reached the pulp or nerve area of the tooth, hence resulting in severe pain and sensitivity. Since you also seem to be complaining of swelling and gum tenderness, it could be due to pus formation. A tooth discolouration is a definite sign of a carious condition. 
Sometimes the tooth may seem discoloured because it has not been brushed properly. Since you are only 20- years-old, you could also be developing a wisdom tooth. There are quite a few possibilities. The real condition can only be definitely confirmed upon a dental check-up with your dental surgeon, as patients tend to describe symptoms which give a totally different picture to what the diagnosis really is. It most likely is a carious tooth. But with your age, this could also mean that you are suffering from a pericoronitis condition which is an infection of the impacted tooth. So for an accurate diagnosis, I suggest you seek treatment from your dental surgeon without delay. Upon visiting your dental surgeon, you will be asked to get an x-ray and your dentist will be able to diagnose it. If its a case of a carious tooth, we examine whether the tooth can be restored. If so, we approach a nerve filling. In this case it could be a root filling as you seem to be complaining of pain and sensitivity, which could mean the decay has spread to the nerves of the tooth. 
There are certain questions we ask the patient, such as whether it is constantly painful or only during the night. Certain details have to be specified in order to arrive at the most appropriate treatment. With a visit to the dental surgeon, your tooth will be given the proper treatment. But it is not as severe as oral cancer and there is no cause for worry. Get the problem treated in time to prevent future complications.

Depression in Teenagers; How to cope with the challenges
	


Depression is a hot topic amongst the social media community these days. It is refreshing to see some of the stigma attached to mental illnesses being washed off by the younger generation.
Still, there are so many in society, including those who are closest to us, who suffer silently without seeking treatment for the fear of being stigmatized. Therefore, we have many more things to learn and a long way to go in the field of attitudes when it comes to depression. 
According to the WHO, 4-8% of the adolescent population is suffering from depression. With major changes taking place in their lives both physically and emotionally, along with many stressors like exams and conflicts with adults, it is important for both parents and children to be aware of the subject, to identify depression in its first stages and seek help. That is why we decided to consult Dr. Udena Attygalle, Child and Adolescent Psychiatrist, to elaborate on the topic. 

About Depression
Some people mistake sadness for depression, but depression is something more serious than a period of sadness. Someone who is depressed may feel low and sad, lack the usual energy they had and be easily fatigued. They may also suffer from a lack of enjoyment and loss of interest in things they enjoyed. These issues have to be persistent and they may find it difficult to get out of this state of sadness and low mood. 
Adolescents and young people may deal with it in different ways. For example, they may be more irritable and angry than sad. Sometimes, they may appear to be coping fine but may be struggling alone with their emotions. While depression is rarer in children, deterioration in academic work for no apparent reason and being persistently clingy or withdrawn, may be signs of depression in this age group. 
Additionally, they may have difficulty concentrating, feel guilty and hopeless or think of suicide and have disturbances in sleep and appetite. 
There could be different degrees of depression as well. Thus, someone with mild depression may continue to work and engage in day-to-day activities, while someone with a more severe form may not be able to do these things. 

What causes Depression
While our genes make us vulnerable to depression, issues such as loss and grief over someone or something we held dear may trigger depression in some (relationship, break-ups or even failure at exams can be losses that are difficult to bear). There may also be other issues that go along with depression, like anxiety. This is especially so in the case of children and adolescents. 
Although many people with depression will not have any thought of suicide, in certain circumstances, this may be the case. The persistent sadness, together with a sense of hopelessness and inescapability, may sometimes be too much to bear. 

Is suicide always related to depression
There are many other risk factors for suicide. Impulsiveness and being unable to regulate emotions can be factors, especially in the case of adolescents and young people. There are many protective factors as well, such as family and community support, easy access to clinical care, appropriate treatment of mental health conditions as well as skills in solving problems and resolving conflicts. 

How can you help
Even though clinically diagnosing depression will require the expertise of a trained professional, providing a supportive non-intrusive environment and helping the person solve or deal with their problems will help relieve their burden. Assuring them that depression is like any other illness and is nothing to be ashamed of, and linking them up with a professional who can help, will go a long way towards changing their lives for the better. 

Treatment
Appropriate treatment is important, as most with depression can be helped and will improve with treatment and continue on with their lives. 
Even though providing a supportive environment and helping the patient cope with, or resolve problems might be the only thing that is needed, in some cases, other types of psychotherapy (talking therapies) and medication can be useful. 

Advice to parents
In the case of children and adolescents, a secure emotional attachment with parents can be an important factor. With emotional attachment comes a sense of security that their parents will be there for them to fall back on, but will also allow them to grow as individuals. Thus, while this will give the adolescents the confidence to deal with difficult situations, they will also feel secure in knowing that if things go wrong they will be accepted and helped. 
Again, as adolescents can struggle with the emotional aspects of relationships, parents who are able to contain situations emotionally in their interactions with their adolescents can better help the adolescents themselves contain and regulate their emotions. 
Resilience is the process of adapting to adversity and other stressors so that they are able to bounce back from difficult experiences with more ease.
Building up resilience in our children from a young age may also help them cope with difficulties later in life.

Diplomat was given the cold shoulder
	

Soon after a certain purohita was assigned a different portfolio at the recent reshuffle, a diplomat from a neighboring country called at his new Ministry to meet him.

This purohita before the reshuffle had told all and sundry that it was his turn to handle the countrys relations with the rest of the world. However, when it came, he had to be content with sea traffic. The envoy who turned up at the Ministry at the appointed time, had to cool his heels in the visitors lounge for about half an hour as the purohita was too busy to receive him immediately. Once inside with the purohita, a grim-faced envoy is said to have briefly stated his business skipping all niceties and left the place in a hurry. Confiding his bitter experience to a local friend later, the irate envoy had reportedly said: He gave me this shabby treatment on purpose, but if his friend  called over he would have got a red carpet welcome!
He had mentioned the name of a diplomat of similar status from a red country based in Colombo, they say.

Kariyawasam said their trade union representatives were given a written assurance that the issues brought up by them would be resolved; however they were forced to reject the solution that was offered to us.
They assured us that a decision on handing over the post office buildings in Nuwara-Eliya, Galle and Kandy would not be taken without the consent of both the Postal Department and the trade unions. But our main demand that staff recruitment should be streamlined did not receive a satisfactory solution. Therefore, we have decided to continue with our trade union action until we get satisfactory answers to all our concerns, he said.
Meanwhile, Kariyawasam said they will hold further discussions with government officials today as well in the hope of coming to a mutual agreement.
Postal services countrywide came to a standstill with the indefinite strike launched by postal unions at Midnight on Monday (26) where 21, 000 postal service employees from 653 post offices and 3,410 sub post offices were involved. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

Getting fatter  Change your lifestyle
	


FAT is a globally-recognized word used to describe people on the heavier side. Health experts warn about the negative impact of being overweight and we already know that this could lead to various health problems. 
Asians are genetically built to store every bit of consumed calories in their physique. Even if our lifestyles and food patterns have changed considerably, our genes remain the same. At present, we spend most of our time seated, consuming huge meals. Junk food leads to unnecessary and unhealthy fats being stored in the body. 
The Chuun-Paan culture has invaded every nook and corner, and families are dependent on the bakers choices over home-made food for every meal, except lunch. Biscuits are yet another problem in addition to Chuun-Paan. Eating even five chocolate biscuits exceeds the daily sugar intake, as biscuits are high in sugars and unhealthy add-ons. Soft drinks, flavoured milk and biscuits are high in sugar content and the regular consumption of these accumulates fat that is difficult to remove without exercise. Unnecessary daily fat storage leads to obesity over time. 

Diseases
A protruding belly is a sure sign of an unhealthy life and the forthcoming sign of sickness. Therefore, people should watch out for belly fat as this could be a sign of diabetes. 
Cheese, milk and chocolate are easily digestible for Europeans, while Asians differ from them genetically. We could easily develop diseases like diabetes due to our genes. Our ancestors who lived free of sugars, were physically active, worked in agriculture and led a simple lifestyle. People from past generations were used to eating grains, fruits, vegetables and green leaves. The noticeable changes in our food patterns are transforming us into sufferers. 30-35% of the countrys population already have diabetes or are in danger of it. These groups also suffer from high blood pressure. Urban citizenry lack awareness on whether or not they have diabetes. 

Medicine
Do not insist on medicine from a doctor. The purpose of visiting a doctor is to get an opinion on the patients situation. The doctor will prescribe medicine if necessary. Its better to change your lifestyle beforehand. 

Lifestyle
Practice the mentality of stopping halfway through a meal when there is more space available. Do not give sweets to kids to get them addicted. Sugar, high blood pressure and cholesterol are controllable with dieting. The size of food portions depends on the employment of a person. A farmer needs more food as he is physically active and a clerk needs less. But the opposite happens. Past generations would work hard, and this burned the fat stored in their bodies.

Considerable changes in lifestyle have also contributed to the increasingly high health risks, including less exercise. Laziness has tempted people to avoid walking even short distances. Children in this era rarely play outside because they are confined to their rooms and seek company, pleasure and sport, all via computers. 

Obesity
Obesity has been identified as a disease around the world and more school-age children suffer from obesity. Children these days put on weight mostly after the scholarship exams, around age 9. Consuming only carbohydrates is unhealthy and salt levels should be controlled as well, because too much salt could harm the kidneys. The unburned energy stored from full meals cause obesity and without the exercise, it is difficult to burn stored-up calories. Controlling the intake of junk food as much as possible helps in managing obesity. It is useless to have fatty meals and fruit juices after vigorous exercises as many do. Obesity causes arthritis, heart attacks, kidney diseases, osteoporosis, stress, sleep problems and affects productivity.

GMOA to take final decision tomorrow
	
The Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) yesterday said they will take a decisive decision tomorrow during its Central Committee meeting if the government would not address their demands with regard to the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM).
GMOA Assistant Secretary Dr. Naveen De Soyza told a news briefing that the coming couple of hours would be crucial and added that their final decision may be a token strike or a certain step beyond it.
Earlier, we called off the strike believing President Maithripala Sirisenas words. We respected his word and had hoped he would mete out justice. But there were many contradictions in the statement issued by the Presidential Secretariat, he said.
He said they have held meetings with several trade unions which were in support of them regarding the SAITM issue. He also said that they just need to announce the dates for the token strike.
Meanwhile, he said that the Cabinet approval to permit the government to take over the Neville Fernando Teaching Hospital (NFTH) attached to the SAITM was a good decision.
However, the solution for our demands is not to take over the NFTH but to nationalize the SAITM, he said. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)

Greig, Arabian nights and Cultural Hubs
	
Going to a concert knowing little about a composer is daunting. Somehow, Edward Greig had not been in my sights, though I would have listened on and off to parts of Peer Gynt suite which crops up often in those roving collections of classical music.
This maybe partly because he was from Norway. Northern Europe has somehow registered in my imagination as a cold, forbidding place (I wonder if some of the bad moments in Ingmar Bergman have anything to do with this). But the concert held at the Lionel Wendt last week featuring pianist Anthony Adkins, backed by Ananda Dabares Krasna ensemble, showed me how wrong Id been. Greig may be Norwegian by birth, but his temperament roves over a larger, warmer and very colourful universe, so romantic in its tender exploration of the exotic.
Indeed, as the orchestra played Peer Gynt Suites No. 1 and 2 before the pianist arrived on stage, I was in for a surprise. In this case, however, I could truly claim that ignorance was bliss. It was as if I was listening to Peer Gynt for the first time. To see a live orchestra of over 50 members perform these eight pieces was a revelation, no comparison with any CD one might hear at home. Besides, one heard one or at most two of these pieces on a CD, whereas the emotional connections and weight of feeling resulting in all eight coming one after another was stupendous.
The titles say a lot about the tone colour of these pieces  Morning Mood, Anitras Dance, The Abduction of the Bridge and Arabian Dance and so forth. Indeed, there is something very East European about them, my mind recalling Tchaikovsky, Glinka, Borodin and even Kachaturyan as the violins sprinkled their notes and the horns and trumpets blew theirs. After the concert, it hardly surprised me to find the following quotation from Tchaikovsky inside the programme notes:
In Greigs music, there prevails that fascinating melancholy which seems to reflect in itself in the beauty of the Norwegian scenery, now grandiose in its vast expanse, now grey and dull, but always full of charm
He may well have been speaking of Russia. But this music goes beyond evoking European geography. Fascinating melancholy it certainly is, but this music has an international temperament, warm enough to override any melancholy. With every note, one senses the excitement of an artiste who was inspired by the rhythms, moods and fantasies of the Middle and Near East.

Reality is that all politically-backed entities are fragile. This trust has the PMs blessings, but it has still a long way to go before we have the sort of state orchestra which Chanmugam envisioned in his speech

Anthony Adkins, described by one British reviewer as a devil of a pianist, apparently played Greigs Concerto in A Minor on an empty stomach, which may be why he didnt seem to be at his best. Due to a crippling stomach problem, hes only had six glasses of water throughout the day. Prodigious as that feat was, the effort taken to shape conductor Ananda Dabares Krasna ensemble at short notice to synch with one of the worlds best pianists cannot be underestimated.

But the reality is that all politically-backed entities are fragile

If both the pianist and conductor were nonplussed by the unnecessary applause (at the start of each movement), they did not show it, but the more knowledgeable members in the audience were shaking their heads.
Mano Chanmugam, in charge of the Colombo Cultural Hub Trust which presented this event, spoke very optimistically about the future, of greater things to come. But the reality is that all politically-backed entities are fragile. This trust has Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghes blessings, but it has still a long way to go before we have the sort of state orchestra which Chanmugam envisioned in his speech.
Credit should go to the PM for the daring idea that Western classical music is worthy of a degree state sponsorship (even though the event would not have been possible without a number of private sponsors). In countries as diverse as Venezuela and the Republic of Congo, people have created Western orchestras against great odds. In Venezuela, this effort had the backing of Hugo Chavez and the result is an international famous youth orchestra and a brilliant young conductor called Gustavo Dudamel.
In this country, however, no government has made a sustainable effort to give Western classical music a due part in the national culture. During the Mahinda-Gotabaya era, their idea of classical was to have military bands play Shantha Me Re Yame next to Diyawanna Oya. There was never any sense that culture is eclectic and wider ranging than that, and should artistically challenge existing norms and standards.
What does that mean For instance, conductor Dabare worked very hard to form his ensemble. The wind section in particular, as well as the timpani player (these were mostly from the Navy) had to be trained how to play Western classical music. That they did so in such a short time is a tribute to everyone involved, musicians as well as the conductor. That is whats meant by being challenged artistically.

Efforts taken to shape conductor Dabares Krasna ensemble at short notice to synch with one of the worlds best pianists cannot be underestimated

Therefore, this is a fine idea but how far will it go and how long will it last Ananda Dabare reportedly had a time of it putting this orchestra together. His Krasna pays homage to his Russian musical upbringing, but its not a full-time professional orchestra. It consisted of musicians from the armed forces bands, chiefly of the navy, the police, some symphony orchestra members and Ananda Dabares own former students.
A room at the state-owned Visum Paya was assigned for practices. This may sound better than Premasiri Khemadasa, his singers and musicians rehearsing Agni opera in the parking lot of the BMICH. But the key to the rehearsal room disappeared mysteriously. Its hard to understand why no spare key was available.
As a result, 50 plus musicians had to practise in a small, cramped room. After two sessions, they gave up and shifted to the St. Peters College auditorium. And its hard to understand why the concert was held at the Lionel Wendt, whose stage was barely large enough to accommodate this orchestra, when the Nelum Pokuna auditorium was there. Or did keys disappear there, too, by any chance
One would certainly like to see the Colombo Cultural Hub Trust reach greater heights, but much will depend on which way the political winds blow
In all this, one senses that politics are above music. One would certainly like to see the Colombo Cultural Hub Trust reach greater heights, but much will depend on which way the political winds blow.

Hartal demanding authorities to fix Uma Oya leak
	
Bandarawela town came to standstill this morning due to a hartal campaign launched to push authorities to repair a leak in a tunnel of the Uma Oya Multipurpose Development Project. 
The USD 529 million project which was constructed in 2009 carries water to the Handapanagala and Lunugamwehera Reservoirs which in turn are redistributed for drinking, irrigation and industrial purposes. 
A crowd of more than 30,000 individuals led by religious leaders and local government members closed shops, markets and other premises in a bid to force authorities to repair the leak which they claimed threatened the safety of the entire area. 
Media reports earlier reported the leak released 80 million liters of water each day for two consecutive weeks. More than 4,000 houses are said to have seen cracks on walls with some parts caving in due to the project which began in 2009.
Police said vehicular movement in the town was obstructed by protestors who have been gathered since morning. Motorists travelling to the area are requested to use alternative routes.
Meanwhile, the cabinet appointed a three member subcommittee to submit an initial report on the situation. The Committee is scheduled to make a trip to the town next week where discussions are to be held with all affected parties.
The subcommittee consists of Minister of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Mahinda Amaraweera, Minister of Megapolis and Western Development Champika Ranawaka and Minister of Irrigation and Water Resources Management Wijith Wijayamuni Zoysa.

The Diyawanna councils presiding one, Boralugoda scion wearing the mantle as the JO boss and a number of other VIPs were among the distinguished guests who attended a commemorative ceremony held to mark the birth anniversary of the son of the Father of the Nation, twice the countrys Prime Minister.

Some people were surprised when the Presiding One who was the first to address the gathering referred to Boralugoda scion as the leader of the Joint Opposition.
The ceremony over, the distinguished guests were being hosted to tea when the organizer of the event, the late leaders paternal nephew now no longer in politics fixed his glance on Boralugoda scion with an enigmatic smile and asked the Presiding One. Sir, when you preside over the august assembly, you dont recognize him as the leader of the JO. But in your address earlier, you referred to him as the leader of the JO. If you are prepared to recognize his status as the JO leader outside the assembly, why dont do so inside the assembly
Everyone present had thought that this question would give the Presiding One a jolt.
However, the Presiding One who looked calm and serene replied with a smile: In the assembly, there are a number of party leaders and I have to listen to them. Here, the situation is quite different. There are no party leaders here for me to consult!

Human Trafficking: US says SL yet to meet minimum standards
	
Sri Lanka was upgraded to Tier 2, the annual Trafficking in Persons Report (2017) released by the US State Secretary Rex W. Tillerson said.
The report stated that the Sri Lankan government demonstrated increasing efforts compared to the previous reporting period and therefore, Sri Lanka was upgraded to Tier 2.
However it said, Sri Lanka did not fully meet the minimum standards for the elimination of human trafficking, however, it was making significant efforts to do so.
The government demonstrated increasing efforts by establishing new anti-trafficking units and creating a Special Police Division for the protection of witnesses and victims of all crimes.
While respecting due process, the report recommended Sri Lanka to improve efforts to investigate and prosecute suspected traffickers, including complicit officials, and convict and punish offenders with sentences commensurate with other serious crimes.
While official complicity in human trafficking persisted, the Government investigated 18 officials for allegedly creating fraudulent documents to provide workers employment abroad, and it prosecuted and convicted more traffickers than in the previous reporting period, it said.
However, the Sri Lankan Government did not meet the minimum standards in several key areas. At times, the governments inconsistent identification of victims resulted in the penalization of victims for prostitution and for immigration violations committed as a result of the victims subjection to trafficking, the report added.
The Government provided no specialized services to male victims and sometimes housed child victims in Government detention centers. The Government maintained specific requirements for migration of female migrant workers including those migrating for domestic work, which observers stated increased the likelihood women would migrate illegally and therefore heightened their vulnerability to human trafficking.
The report recommended:
Increase efforts to proactively identify trafficking victims and train officials on victim identification and referral procedures, especially to ensure victims are not detained or otherwise penalized for unlawful acts, such as immigration violations or prostitution, committed as a direct result of having been subjected to human trafficking; improve protection services to ensure identified victims, including men and children, receive specialized care services; take steps to eliminate all recruitment fees charged to workers by labor recruiters and instead ensure they are paid by employers; expand the bureau of foreign employments (SLBFE) mandate to include the regulation of sub-agents; promote safe and legal migration and ensure migration regulations do not discriminate on the basis of gender; and increase efforts of the task force to meet regularly with all members to enhance government coordination efforts the report also recommended.
Tier one Countries are whose governments fully comply with the Trafficking Victims Protection Acts (TVPA) minimum standards. Tier two countries are whose governments do not fully comply with the Trafficking Victims Protection Acts (TVPA)s minimum standards, but are making significant efforts to bring themselves into compliance with those standards. Earlier Sri Lanka was below that which is Watch List. There are countries through who do not comply with these regulations.

Hypocrisy in bureaucracy!
	

The main chair of a government department responsible for raking in the lion share of the government revenue had fallen vacant and an interview was held recently to select a candidate to fill the vacant post.

The interview board set up to screen the candidates comprised two secretarial ones at the highest level.
According to knowledgeable ones, of all candidates, the best qualified for the post was a senior female mandarin who had earlier functioned in the post in an acting capacity. However, the secretarial duo had selected another candidate who could not hold a candle to the female high-up.
Accounting for their decision for rejecting the female candidate, the duo who sat on the board had said that they did not want to select a person who maintained close ties with the previous regime.
However, an informed source says that the explanation offered by the secretarial duo evokes more hilarity than scorn. For it is a well-known secret that this secretarial duo openly worked hard for the former strongman at the last big poll and in fact, they had been with him on the day of the poll and remained there until the wee hours of the following morning. When it became quite clear their horse had lost the race, they had left the palace and lost no time in getting on board with the winning side, the same source said. Hypocrisy at its worst! he added.

The Elections Commission yesterday said the Local Government elections can be held before the year end if technical issues pertaining to the Local Government Election Law are resolved by July this year.
Addressing the media at the Elections Secretariat, Commission's Chairman Mahinda Deshapriya also said that it is technically possible to hold the Provincial Council elections before the Local Government elections.
Eastern, North Central and Sabaragamuwa PC elections were held in December 2012 and therefore official term of those councils will expire in September and October this year. The Elections Commission has to issue an election notification within seven days after the term expires. Therefore the Commission has to issue the date of the announcement of the elections on October 2, he said.
Deshapriya said the elections for the Northern, North Central and Sabaragamuwa Provincial Councils could be held by December 10 if these councils term end in August this year.
The circular on collecting statistics to Local and Provincial Council elections would be issued on July 1. The circular would be issued to collect the information of the State sector officials and government school teachers, he added.
Only if the Bill is passed related to resolve the technical issues in the Local Government elections within the month of July, the Local Government elections can be held in October. The two main political parties have come to an agreement on holding the Local Government elections, he said.
The Elections Commission was prepared to announce the LG elections by the first week of October. (Chaturanga Pradeep)

Massive cyberattack hits Europe with widespread ransom demands
	
A new wave of powerful cyberattacks hit Europe and beyond on Tuesday in a possible reprise of a widespread ransomware assault in May.
Accordig to the Washington Post reports it said affected were a Russian oil giant, a Danish shipping and energy conglomerate, and Ukrainian government ministries, which were brought to a standstill in a wave of ransom demands. The virus even downed systems at the site of the former Chernobyl nuclear power plant, forcing scientists to monitor radiation levels manually.
Cyberattacks also spread as far as India and the United States, where the pharmaceutical giant Merck reported on Twitter that our companys computer network was compromised today as part of global hack. The New Jersey-based company said it was investigating the attack.
Cyber researchers say that the virus, which was linked to malware called Petrwrap or Petya, used an exploit developed by the National Security Agency that was later leaked onto the Internet by hackers. It is the second massive attack in the past two months to turn powerful U.S. exploits against the IT infrastructure that supports national governments and corporations.
The onslaught of ransomware attacks may be the new normal, said Mark Graff, the chief executive of Tellagraff, a cybersecurity company.
The emergence of Petya and WannaCry really points out the need for a response plan and a policy on what companies are going to do about ransomware, he said. WannaCry was the ransomware used in the May attack. You wont want to make that decision at a time of panic, in a cloud of emotion.
The attack mainly targeted Eastern Europe but also hit companies in Spain, Denmark, Norway and Britain. Victims included the British advertising and marketing multinational WPP and a shipping company, APM Terminals, based at the port of Rotterdam.
But the damage was worst in Ukraine.
Researchers at Kaspersky Labs Global Research and Analysis Team, in Russia, estimated that 60 percent of infected computers were in Ukraine and 30 percent in Russia.
The hacks targeted government ministries, banks, utilities and other important infrastructure and companies nationwide, demanding ransoms from government employees in the cryptocurrency bitcoin.
The hacks scale and the use of ransomware recalled the massive cyberattack in May in which hackers possibly linked to North Korea disabled computers in more than 150 nations using a flaw that was once incorporated into the National Security Agencys surveillance tool kit.
Cyber researchers have tied the vulnerability exploited by Petya to the one used by WannaCry  a weakness discovered by the NSA years ago that the agency turned into a hacking tool dubbed EternalBlue. Petya, like WannaCry, is a worm that spreads quickly to vulnerable systems, said Bill Wright, senior policy counsel for Symantec, the worlds largest cybersecurity firm. But that makes it difficult to control  or to aim at anyone in particular, he said.
Once you unleash something that propagates in this manner, its impossible to control, he said.
Although Microsoft in March made available a patch for the Windows flaw that EternalBlue exploited, Petya uses other techniques to infect systems, said Jeff Greene, Symantec government affairs director. Its a worm that has multiple ways to spread, he said, which could explain why there are victims who applied the EternalBlue patch and still were affected.
The initial infection was in Ukraine and spread to Europe, said Paul Burbage, a malware researcher with Flashpoint, a cyberthreat analysis firm. Petya differs from WannaCry in that it does not appear to reach out to the Internet and scan for vulnerable systems, he said. It limits itself to the computers linked to the same router, he said.
The ransomware used in the attacks is a variant of Petya called GoldenEye, which was sold on underground forums used mainly by Russian-speaking criminal hackers, he said.
The ransomware hit Europe in the early afternoon. Ground zero was Ukraine. Breaches were reported at computers governing the municipal energy company and airport in the capital, Kiev, the state telecommunications company Ukrtelecom, the Ukrainian postal service and the State Savings Bank of Ukraine.
Grocery store checkout machines broke down, ATMs demanded ransom payments, and the turnstile system in the Kiev metro reportedly stopped working.
The mayhem reached high into the government. Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Pavlo Rozenko on Tuesday tweeted a picture of a computer screen warning in English that one of your disks contains errors, then adding in all capital letters: DO NOT TURN OFF YOUR PC! IF YOU ABORT THIS PROCESS, YOU COULD DESTROY ALL YOUR DATA!
Ta-Dam! he wrote. It seems the computers at the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine have been knocked out. The network is down. His spokeswoman published a photograph showing demands for a ransom in bitcoin to release data encrypted by the virus.
Suspicions in Ukraine quickly fell on Russia, which annexed Crimea in 2014 and has been blamed for several large-scale cyberattacks on Ukraines power infrastructure. But no proof of the attack was presented, and Russian companies, like the oil giant Rosneft, also complained of being hit by a powerful hacking attack. Photographs leaked to the news media from a Rosneft-owned regional oil company showed computers displaying ransomware demands similar to those in Ukraine.
The virus also brought havoc to Western Europe. A.P. Moller - Maersk, a Danish transport and energy conglomerate, announced that Maersk IT systems are down across multiple sites and business units due to a cyber attack.
The company was trying to determine exactly how broad the attack was. We are assessing the situation, and of course the safety of our employees and our operations alongside our customers business  these are our top priorities, Maersk spokeswoman Concepcin Boo Arias said.

MYTH: If you pluck one grey hair two will grow in its place. 

BUSTED: This is not true. There is no scientific basis for this. Even if you pluck the hair or cut it, it doesnt alter the growing process. When you pluck the hair, the whole thing will come out. So it takes a little bit longer for the new hair to grow but two strands will not grow in the place of one. Grey hairs will occur due to various reasons. Mainly genetic predisposition, hormonal imbalances and some vitamin deficiencies will give rise to grey hair. It happens because the pigment cells are lost in the root of the hair. Unless there is a cause for the greying which we can treat, there is no way to treat the greying of hair. explained Dr. Nayani Madarasinghe, Consultant Dermatologist.

Pan Asia Bank offers Nivasa home loan with 10-year fixed interest rate
	
In a bid to meet the rapidly increasing demand for a hassle-free housing loan, Pan Asia Bank has come up with an option to enable the customers to obtain a home loan without the hassle of paper work.
Further, they will have the option of opting to fix their interest rate for 10 years so that they are not impacted by the countrys interest rate volatilities.
Under the hassle-free documentation handling option, the customers are offered a special service of obtaining the clearance documents from the local authorities via an agent. This service enables the customers save their valuable time spent in government offices trying to get clearance documents to apply for a housing loan.
Moreover, in order to offer a stable repayment option for its customers, the Pan Asia Bank Nivasa housing loan now comes with an interest rate that is fixed for a period of 10 years from the date of granting the loan. With this new interest rate, the Nivasa housing loan customer can maintain the same instalment value despite any upward trends in market interest rates. The Pan Asia Bank Nivasa housing loan can be obtained for multiple purposes including building a house, buying a block of land to build a house, completing, renovating or extending a partially built house, repaying an existing housing loan from a recognized financial institution and purchasing a condominium.
Under this loan scheme, the customers can obtain loan facilities with flexible repayment options of up to 25 years. The loan amount is decided based on the BOQ value and the repayment ability of the customer where they can obtain loans up to 100 percent of the BOQ value when the customer owns the land and in other cases up to 75 percent of the BOQ value or the valuation of the property.
Pan Asia Nivasa-Step Up scheme is another innovation that was added to the product recently. The Nivasa-Step Up scheme is a unique scheme available for professionals and permanent employed customers that enables them to repay with lower instalments initially and increase the instalments gradually as their income increases. Since the instalments are comparatively low during the initial stages, it enhances a customers ability to go for a higher loan quantum thereby making their dream home a reality.
The special documentation handling service is available for both these schemes.
Interested individuals can visit any of the 83 Pan Asia Bank branches across the country to apply for these loans. Further detail on this product can be obtained through Pan Asia Bank call centre.

Planning to retire hurt
	

The ICC champions trophy 2017 held the biggest disappointment for India. The poor showing by our own willow wielders just when the hopes were soaring sky-high was a great disappointment for the local fans too.

 The event had given rise to rumblings within games controlling body for the deputy chair who had long found a new world in the national game had quietly tendered his resignation taking a cue from the committee chairman, they say. The chair of the controlling body had refused to accept the resignation as he had done on two previous occasions. However, the deputy is said to have put his foot down that he would not change his mind.
The main reason for the deputys decision to quit is not the defeat suffered by the national team, but his unhappiness about certain goings-on in the controlling body, inside sources say.
Several more resignations are due to follow and even Gura is straddling the fence, they say.

Joint Trade Union Alliance of Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) yesterday warned of a possible disruption of power supply today due to its scheduled protest march and conference attended by its members from around the country .
The Alliance General Secretary Ranjan Jayalal said more than 22,000 employees of the CEB would participate at the conference.
Mr. Jayalal said that they would hold the conference following a protest march demanding solutions to the CEB employees salary anomalies.
He said around 1,200 officials of the CEB hierarchy were attempting to hoodwink the employees and a proposal has made to the Cabinet to privatise the CEB.
We would not tolerate authorities actions anymore. The country will experience the trade union action, There could be disruptions in the national power supply however; most of the breakdowns will be attended, he said.
Further, he said the billing centres and other services will be affected during the conference period though the power stations will be in operation.
Jayalal said CEB employees had reached the limit of their patience and would soon take stern trade union actions against the government. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

Prosecutors seek to delay deportation of Lankan accused of murder
	
Sivaloganathan Thanabalasingham, the man accused of killing his wife and whose trial was stayed by the Superior Court, is slated to be deported to Sri Lanka on previous charges, but Quebec Crown prosecutors are requesting the Canadian government block the deportation, according to reports.
Thanabalasingham, who initially contested the deportation order handed to him in April because of a domestic violence conviction, could leave as early as next week.
His murder trial was stayed in March by Superior Court Justice Alexandre Boucher in what is considered to be the first time a murder charge in Quebec was stayed because of the Supreme Court of Canadas Jordan ruling last July. Boucher determined the case took too long to get to trial afterThanabalasingham waited five years. The Jordan ruling states that a trial for serious offences cannot be postponed for more than 30 months after the arrest.
However, Quebecs director of penal and criminal prosecutions appealed this decision in April and has sent a request to Canadas minister of immigration, refugees and citizenship, Ahmed Hussen, to postpone the deportation until a decision is made on the appeal.
IfThanabalasingham is deported, it remains uncertain whether he could come back to Canada for the trial, since Canada does not have an extradition agreement with Sri Lanka.(National Post)

Russia brands US warning to Syria over chemical weapons unacceptable
	
REUTERS, 27th JUNE, 2017- Russia denounced a U.S. warning to the Syrian leadership that it will pay a heavy price for any chemical weapons attack, and dismissed White House assertions that a strike was being prepared as unacceptable.
The White House said on Monday the preparations in Syria were similar to actions before an April 4 chemical attack which killed dozens of civilians and prompted U.S. President Donald Trump to order a missile strike on a Syrian air base.
But Russia, which is President Bashar al-Assads main backer in Syrias six-year-old civil war and has used its veto power on the United Nations Security Council several times to shield his government, challenged the U.S. intelligence.
I am not aware of any information about a threat that chemical weapons can be used, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told a conference call with reporters on Tuesday.
Certainly, we consider such threats to the legitimate leadership of the Syrian Arab Republic unacceptable.
Russian officials have privately described the war in Syria as the biggest source of tension between Moscow and Washington, and the cruise missile strike ordered by Trump in April raised the risk of confrontation between them.

Subject is too important for him to listen to family members!

A purohita in yahapalanaya hailing from the Colombo district is getting ready to take wings to the land of kangaroos to undertake an in-depth study of the subject of co-existence in a multi-ethnic and multi-religious society as it obtains in practice in that country. He also had decided that he should have secretarial assistance if he were to successfully carry out the proposed study. This has thrown open a window of a wonderful opportunity for his fair and lovely personal secretary to do an extensive tour in that foreign land at public expense. Meanwhile, the highly disconcerted wife and other family members are reportedly making every effort possible to block the politicos study tour. However, given the importance of the subject of co-existence, the politico may shortly leave for the land of kangaroos with the comely secretary in tow, they say.

The road to fitness through CARDIO
	
We, living in this modernized world are highly competitive, running a never-ending rat race. Most of us heat up our chairs all day to meet career goals, hardly paying any attention to the importance of exercise. In a society like this, sparing some extra time working-out is encouraged in order to be healthy. 
As you visit the gym daily and work hard to prepare your body for the next beach session with fit abs and an attractive figure, have you ever wondered whether your body is responding to your efforts as much as you expect it to Cardio does all the magic here and becoming aware of it will help you carry out your fitness sessions with more effectiveness and knowledge. 
10 exercises of 30 seconds each 

Boxer Shuffle 
	Overhead Reaches & Toe Touch Stretches 
	Slow High Knee March 
	Torso Twists 
	Alternating Toe Touch Kicks 
	Full Torso Circles 
	Lateral Step Toe Touches 
	Squats 
	Jumping Jacks 
	High Knees 


What is Cardio
It is the short term for Cardiovascular, which involves the heart and blood vessels which circulate oxygenated blood throughout the body. Engaging in cardio simply means the involvement of an individual in endurance exercises, which enhances the effectiveness of our cardiovascular system.  Any activity which makes your heart rate go up to 50-75% of the maximum value owned by your body comes under Cardio. This value can be roughly calculated by reducing your age from 220.  E.g.: If you are a 30 years old, the maximum heart rate you can go up to is 220-30= 190 

Where does the secret lie
Cardio can be tiring, yet it is a powerful tool when aiming for a healthy fat loss. It also creates an energy deficit in our metabolism, which significantly reduces the amount of food needed. It must always be carried out in a style which targets a maximum break-down of fat for energy while sparing muscle mass and that is where the need for HIIT (High Intensity Interval Training) arises. 
This special tactic involves 20 minutes of cardio comprising of, 

Warming-up 
	Short high-intensity period 
	Moderate low-intensity period 
	Cooling-down phase 
Warming up and cooling down are two MUSTs to be carried out during a work-out. Warming up, at the very beginning, prepares our body for strenuous exercises, whereas cooling down will get our body back to its normal pace at the end of the session. We are going to examine the benefits of these two activities, properly blended up with cardio in order to gain the maximum physical results expected. 

Warming-up
There are several bodily changes observed during these exercises, like increased heart rate, respiratory rate, energy releasing reactions and blood supply to muscles with oxygen and glucose. 
It is obvious that our body excessively heats up during work outs, just like a car engine. Therefore, slowly adjusting your body to such changes is highly important, since sudden heating up procedures without any prior preparation can even end up in death. A good warm-up will dilate blood vessels and ensure a good blood supply to your muscles whereas body temperature will get adjusted for optimal efficiency. 
Light cardio and dynamic stretching exercises are effective in avoiding muscle and ligament strains. The ulterior motive of this is to prepare your cardiovascular system without shocking it at once, by exposing it to a sudden strenuous exertion. 
This cardio workout of 5 minutes will play an active role in the vigorous activities about to follow. As a bonus point, the calorie burning role of these light bodyweight cardio movements will introduce your body to a jump-start for fat burning. 
Once this cardio warming-up session is over, your body will be fit enough to face any challenge on strength, HIIT, endurance, power, toning or stretching. 

Cooling-down
This is as important as warm-ups, because all your heated body muscles and dilated blood vessels should come back to its normal status, following a tough session of work-out, in order to function in the normal manner.
Lack of these may lead to vomiting and discomfort, so it is always good to spare a few seconds on pampering your tired muscles through dynamic stretching and cardio. 
Dynamic stretching will reduce the formation of lactic acid in muscles, which is responsible for cramps and stiffness. 
Swinging between high and low intensity phases will keep your body in a fat-burning mode without burning carbohydrates or proteins for energy. Several research studies have shown that HIIT is highly effective on optimal fitness which burns fat 50% more efficiently than low-intensity cardio, which is definitely a plus point! 
However, all this hard work could go down the drain if you practice wrong techniques without proper guidance. So, always stick to a professional and work-out in a manner where you can gain the maximum benefits while working the least.

They also say that they propose to expose the errant purohita duo shortly.
They claim that they have secured enough evidence to prove that a tug o war between two purohitas triggered by their competitive quest for commissions and other gratifications has delayed finding a durable solution to the garbage problem. We are still in the process of gathering documentary evidence. We hope to make a full exposure after preparing an open and shut case against the two guys, a JO source said.

Transparency and Condominiums
	
The public need to applaud the elucidation compiled by Ms. Kamanthi Wickramasinghe of the Daily Mirror in her article Condominiums: The Next Big Worry. The article synthesises the opinions of two leading lights of the legal profession namely Kirthimala Gunasekera and Ajithaa Edirimanne, educating us on the pitfalls that need to be circumvented when investing in the real estate market inSri Lanka.
We are warned of the high probability that the much hyped vertical living spaces are being sold without approved plans and valid deeds (maybe sans quality standards as well). It is quite possible that we are being lured by promotional literature aimed to cover inner deficiencies and inadequacies. We are beckoned by the promise of ultimate grandeur to live in prestigious exclusivity where the norm is ultra-superior urban style; offering designer fittings, superior finishes and priceless comfort. No assurance is given on safe drinking water supply (how often are the sumps and overhead tanks cleaned); are we releasing sewerage into the 100-year-old sewerage system in Colombo put in place by the British How reliable are the in- built safeguards to face fire hazards Should we take for granted the adequacy of engineering design parameters embodied The recent fire in the London Tower gives credence to the question raised by Mrs. Gunasekera asking whether the fire brigade can reach the 30th floor; or even the 12th floor in Sri Lanka
We are beckoned by the promise of ultimate grandeur to live in prestigious exclusivity where the norm is ultra-superior urban style
In her experience she has come across a large number of high rises constructed without approved plans and title deeds. The question arises whether the plans could have never been approved and the developer would not have been able to execute and pass real legal ownership to his clients. These are circumvention of the obligations related to the existing legal and statutory framework. How many such living spaces are being offered in the market Were the engineering parameters compromised too This could lead to dire consequences in the future. The Wellawatte incident is an eye-opener. In the next ten years, how many no-document condos would collapse Both Kirthimala and Ajithaa confirm that majority of developers refrain from following the required approval and registration procedure. The legal experts point out the inadequacy of the legal framework to sufficiently protect the public.
Globally, the transparency of real estate is under intense scrutiny. There is widening recognition of the crucial role that a transparent real estate sector plays, not only as a facilitator of new investment and business activity but also, significantly, in community well-being and inclusiveness.
In the developed world as investments to the real estate sector grow, investors demand further improvements in transparency, even among the worlds most transparent real estate markets. There are mounting pressures in developed countries for greater real estate transparency and to intensify the fight against corruption. The global real estate industry is making steady advances by enacting new legislation to set higher ethical standards.
There is wide canvassing among the communities for improved security of property ownership, supported by functioning, clear and accessible land registry and processing systems. Safe housing and workplaces underpinned by robust legislation and consistent enforcement of standards are urgently required. In such a framework, only the public will be able to trust agents to act honestly and professionally. With strong regulatory oversight, professional bodies will be able to enforce codes of conduct and ensure fair play. While concrete steps towards greater real estate market transparency are being made in several low transparency and opaque countries, Sri Lanka is struggling with the complexities of implementing new regulatory structures.
As per UDA estimation, somewhere around 2020 or 2022 the country will come to a peak for the real estate market bubble to burst
With regard to real estate transparency, some 109 countries are classified as highly transparent, transparent, semi-transparent, low transparency and opaque. Sri Lanka is ranked as 69 in the index and falls under the low transparency category. Countries such as Vietnam, Morocco, Uruguay, Ukraine, Iran, Jordan, Pakistan and Myanmar are categorised as low transparent.
Among highly transparent countries are UK, Australia, USA, France, New Zealand, Germany and the Netherlands. Singapore, Sweden, Poland, Hong Kong, Norway and Japan are classified under transparent. In the opaque category which comes next to low transparent are countries such as Oman, Uganda, Tunisia, Ethiopia and Iraq. Mainly in the low transparent and opaque groups, regulatory reforms will be essential to safeguard the general public. Greater emphasis will need to be placed on regulatory enforcement, particularly in low transparent markets, where there is the greatest disconnect between regulations and actual enforcement. 
As per UDA estimation, somewhere around 2020 or 2022 the country will come to a peak for the real estate market bubble to burst (however this is refuted by leading developers). Sri Lanka at the moment is experiencing an upward movement in development and the demand for apartments and condominium is high and the supply is increasing to cater to the demand. Have developers entered into the race to capture the market by rushing and pushing their products through the construction process, with scant regard to quality standards and the regulatory framework In the process, are construction quality standards being compromised Will many others like the Wellawatte product enter the market How many amateur developers are entering and operating in Sri Lankas real estate market
Sri Lanka is experiencing an upward movement in development and the demand for apartments and condominium is high
The Megapolis and Western Development Ministry is planning to transform the entire Western Province into a megapolis by ushering comprehensive development within the next five years, taking into account bio-geo-physical and socio-economic aspects. Under the circumstances, the ministry will be required to address effectively the regulatory, statutory and legal framework governing the development of the built environment.

WASHINGTON AFP June27, 2017 - US President Donald Trump and his policies are broadly unpopular around the world --with the notable exceptions of Russia and Israel - according to a poll released Monday. 
The Pew Research Center survey, which surveyed people in 37 nations, showed a sharp decline in the average trust for Americas leader to do the right thing when it comes to international affairs. 
Twenty-two percent reported they had faith in Trump to guide Americas role in the world, compared with a 64 percent level of confidence in Barack Obama in the final years of his presidency, Pew Research said. 
In the eyes of most people surveyed around the world, the White Houses new occupant is arrogant, intolerant and even dangerous, according to a statement released with the poll, which was carried out between Feb. 16 and May 8.

HINDUSTAN TIMES, 27th JUNE, 2017
Five decades since it heralded a transformation in the way people obtained and used cash, the worlds first ATM was turned into gold for celebrations of its fiftieth anniversary.
The brainchild of Scottish inventor Shepherd-Barron, the first ATM (automated teller machine) was opened on June 27, 1967 at a branch of Barclays Bank in Enfield, north London, the first of six cash dispensers commissioned by the bank.
English actor Reg Varney, who starred in the British TV comedy show On The Buses, was the first person to withdraw cash from the new machine.
