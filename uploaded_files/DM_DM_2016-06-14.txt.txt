A cheerless visit with a cheer squad
	

A deputy purohita recently arrived in a township at the periphery with two van-loads of supporters as a cheer squad for an opening ceremony on the eve of the event, to find to his dismay that somebody else had beaten him to it.

The deputy had checked in to a hotel in Mahiyangana with his following to be on time the following morning to open a branch office of a commercial establishment coming under his Ministry. However, when he turned up at the new branch office premises there was none to receive him with the usual fanfare nor was there any sign of a celebration about to take place. When the deputy explained the purpose of his coming, the manager of the new branch office had replied: Sir, the chairman opened this branch office at a simple ceremony held yesterday.
The crest fallen deputy had turned back with his cheer squad suppressing his boiling anger.

Copy of latest volume of Mahavansa presented to PM
	
Even India wouldnt have got to know facts about its history if Mahawansa was not written, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said today.
He made this remark when a copy of the latest volume of Mahawansa, the chronicle of Sri Lankan history was presented to him by its editorial team led by Professor Chandra Wickramage at Temple Trees last evening.
 The Asoka Chakra which is depicted in the Indian flag is sketched in the Mahawansa as no Indian document had been found with such facts while the situation is same with the Stupa at the Indian Presidents House as the Mahawansa contains facts about that as well, the Prime Minister said.
Coming up with more facts about the history in the region, he said the centre of Therawada Buddhism was one time located in Afghanistan. I read about this recently, he said while revealing that some inscriptions from this temple had been taken to China.
Also he said the era of Buddha which is stated in the Mahawansa had been proven correct and accurate through research.
Further, he said it is essential to record the facts about Sri Lankas colonial history as well. He said two Sri Lankan universities including Peradeniya and Colombo had done research about this but it is essential to record the entire history of Sri Lanka including the colonial history. Sri Lanka should ask for the documents which are in Portugal, Netherlands and Britain so that it would be possible to record the complete history of Sri Lanka, he said.
Sri Lanka has a dearth of historians. There are only politicians to talk about history but they manipulate the history for their benefit, he said while revealing that the government is planning to set up a National Institute of History.
Professor Wickramage who elaborated on the latest volume of the Mahawansa said it comprises facts from 6 BC to 1978. He said the errors of other volumes have been corrected in the latest one. Also it was highlighted that there is no such document called Chulawansa as it is also part of Mahawansa. We have now rectified all these errors and had come with an accurate version of Mahawansa, he said. The new volume had been compiled after an eight year research. (Yohan Perera)

FCID questions Keheliya over Rs.20Mn accident compensation
	
Former Minister Keheliya Rambukwella arrived at the FCID this morning after he was summoned in connection with a probe of claiming Rs.20 million from the Presidents Fund as compensation for his accident in Australia.
The FCID commenced a probe recently following a statement made by Deputy Minister Ranjan Ramanayake in Parliament regarding certain allegations involving MP Rambukwella obtaining Rs. 20 million from the Presidents Fund following an accident he met with in Australia.
The FCID detectives said they have learnt through the statement recorded from Deputy Minister Ramanayake that the former Minister had claimed and received the compensation from the Presidents Fund in 2013 in addition to receiving accident compensation from both the hotel in Melbourne as well as from his personal insurance in Sri Lanka.
Rambukwella met with the accident in early February, 2012 during a private visit to Australia to receive treatment to his son, and sustained injuries to his legs after falling off the third storey balcony of his Melbourne hotel.

GMOA doctors to leave the country
	
The Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) today warned that doctors would be compelled to leave the country unless the difficulties they face when admitting their children to national schools were resolved.
GMOA General Secretary Dr. Nalinda Herath told a news conference that children of government doctors were discriminated by the relevant government authorities. He alleged that they were bent on taking revenge on the doctors through their children.
He said however, that children of judges have been admitted to national schools.
"If this sad state of affairs continues, the doctors would be left with no option but to migrate overseas where adequate facilities were provided to medical professionals," Dr. Herath said.
He said at this rate the country would end up losing its doctors.
Dr. Herath said there are hundreds of children who had been deprived of admission to national schools this year.
Government doctors are sent for foreign medical training to be better equipped to serve the people and the country. Some doctors are transferred every four years according to the special transfer scheme and as such find it difficult to show five-years of permanent residence to get national school admission for their children. After they return to the country, they find that their children are without schools, he said.
As a result of the pressure exerted by the GMOA on President Maithripala Sirisena, the Education Ministry confirms that the doctors' children would be admitted to national schools.
The GMOA said this assurance has been limited to words and not put into practice. (Piyumi Fonseka)

A private power generating project planned to be launched in Chunnakam with a view to feeding electricity to the national grid at a relatively low cost has been abandoned following a strong objection made by a powerful political authority in yahapalanaya.

Those behind the proposed project had assured the authorities that they would be able to supply electricity at the rate of Rs.10 per unit once their plant is in operation. Meanwhile, CEB engineers say that the Board is now buying power from the private sector at the rate of Rs.20 to Rs.23 per unit and electricity for Rs.10 per unit from the proposed power plant project would be a great boon.
However, the political authority has put his foot down saying that the CEB should not buy electricity cheap from the proposed project for it would deal a blow to the private sector suppliers of electricity generated from wind power.

The countrys economy is facing a crisis. Prices of essential commodities such as sugar, salt and dhal have risen. The foreign debt has increased and if the President reappoints the current Governor of Central Bank, the countrys economy would be destroyed, he added.
Mr. Gunawardena said the countrys trust has been devalued because of the Treasury Bond Scam. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)

The reappointment of Arjuna Mahendran as the Governor of Central Bank after his term ends on June 30 this year will not be an issue as the Supreme Courts has acquitted him of all charges, Leader of the House Lakshman Kiriella said yesterday.
The Minister told a media briefing that his personal opinion was that Mr. Mahendran should be re-appointed to the post.
The Supreme Courts has given Mr Mahendran a good character certificate by acquitting him of all charges and therefore why make a fuss over it, he questioned.
Those who are making allegations against him are lucky as no one will opt to file defamation cases as in Sri Lanka as such it takes a long time to be completed. But if such allegations are made in a country such as the US it would be a different story as a case is completed within a year and some media institutions also should keep this in mind+, the Minister added.
He said those MPs who want Mr Mahendran out had not read the Supreme Court judgment.
Responding to a question raised by the journalists as to why a special select committee is not appointed to probe into the controversial bond issue regarding which allegations are made against the central bank chief the Minister said the committee on public enterprises (COPE) is currently carrying out an investigation on it. "There is no need for another select committee as COPE is probing the bond issue, he said. (Yohan Perera)

Commenting on issue of appointing former Defence Secretary Gothabaya Rajapaksa as the second leader of the SLFP, Rural Economic Affairs Minister P. Harrison said there was no necessity for such an appointment as the present leader of the party, President Maithripala Sirisena was capable of handling the party.
President Sirisena had been working as the General Secretary of the party for some years and won few elections. President Sirisena is an experienced man with more than 40 years in politics and therefore it is not necessary to bring in another Rajapaksa as a leader, he said.
Responding to a question raised by journalists on the purchasing of new vehicles for Ministers, Harrison said he had not asked for new vehicle as the two vehicles he already had were sufficient for him. I dont need new vehicles as the two I have are sufficient for me, he said.
Meanwhile, commenting on a request made by some of his Cabinet colleagues that Arjuna Mahendran should not be re appointed as the Governor of Central Bank, the minister said the non-appointment of Mahendran would not be a big issue.
If Mahendran was not appointed to the Governors post he will secure another job even abroad, and will not perish. Therefore it is not a major issue, Minister Harrison said responding to a question raised by journalists at a media briefing today.

for guarantors.

Previous regime yet to answer vital questions: MS
	
The previous administration was still to answer the question as to why the Presidential Election was called two years prematurely and why no effort was taken to promote reconciliation and inter communal harmony in the post conflict period, President Maithripala Sirisena asked yesterday.
Addressing a panel discussion themed Sri Lanka in Global Affairs: The Journey Since January 2015 at the BMICH last afternoon, President Sirisena went onto say that his government established after January 8, 2015 inherited a plethora of serious global and domestic issues that should have been addressed by the last government and the consensual government was still struggling to find answers to some of them.
It is indeed not an easy task to address those issues. Sri Lanka was entangled in a huge web of domestic and international issues. The UN, powerful countries and world leaders were not on good terms with Sri Lanka. What I cannot understand is that when I and my government attempt to take our country out of this mess, the detractors of the government say I was going to betray the country and give opportunities to foreign powers to invade Sri Lanka. I flatly reject those unfounded and fabricated allegation, President Sirisena stressed.
There were different opinions and different interpretations over Sri Lankas foreign policy. But the government could not take advices given by any Tim, Dick or Harry. The government would however follow the most pragmatic and suitable foreign policy that would bring maximum dividends to the country. It was with this policy, the government has won the friendship, acceptance and respect among the global community and top world leaders in the past one and half years, [President Sirisena emphasized.
President Sirisena said his government was not dictated by any foreign power or did not take order from any one. There was no one to pressurize Sri Lanka today. But the international community expects Sri Lanka protect Human Rights, Fundamental Rights, strengthen the rule of law, democracy and the concept of good governance They also want a free media culture in Sri Lanka.(Sandun A Jayasekera)

Fitch Ratings has assigned Senkadagala Finance PLCs (BBB+(lka)/stable) proposed issue of senior unsecured redeemable debentures of up to Rs.2 billion an expected National long-term rating of BBB+(lka)(EXP).
The debentures will have tenors of two to four years and carry fixed and floating coupons.
The debentures are to be listed on the Colombo Stock Exchange and the company plans to use the proceeds to fund loan growth, diversify its funding mix and reduce structural maturity mismatches.
The final rating is subject to the receipt of final documentation conforming to information already received.
The proposed debentures are rated at the same level as SFCs national long-term rating as they will constitute direct, unconditional, unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of SFC. SFCs rating reflects the satisfactory credit profile that it has maintained through economic cycles, its relatively strong franchise amongst finance companies in Sri Lanka and access to longer-term institutional funding.
These are counterbalanced by its deposit franchise and capitalisation, which are weaker compared with higher-rated peers.
