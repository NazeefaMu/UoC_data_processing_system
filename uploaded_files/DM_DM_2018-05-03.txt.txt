Cabinet reshuffle further empowers UNP: GL
	
The recent Cabinet reshuffle has further empowered the United National Party (UNP) and weakened the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP), said Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) leader G.L. Peiris.
He told a news conference that several prominent ministries like Social Welfare, Social Empowerment, Labour and Trade Union Relations, which were under the SLFP, had now been grabbed by the UNP to centralize the powers of the government.
It is evident that the government is run by UNP policies. What is pathetic is that even the SLFPers follow these policies without considering the fact that they are harmful to the country. At a time when Sri Lanka is battered by political and economic catastrophes because of UNP governance, the SLFP should announce its stance to continue with the government,"Prof. Peiris said.
"The government is not concerned about extraditing Arjuna Mahendran, the mastermind behind the Central Bank Bond scam, to Sri Lanka. Mr. Mahendran is not hiding himself but being hidden by the government. If the government is unable to arrest a single person, then we cannot expect any good from the government, Prof. Peiris added.

Cambridge Analytica: FB data-harvest firm to shut
	
Cambridge Analytica, the political consultancy at the centre of the Facebook data-sharing scandal, is shutting down.
The firm was accused of improperly obtaining personal information on behalf of political clients.
According to Facebook, data about up to 87 million of its members was harvested by a quiz app and then passed on to the political consultancy.
The social network said its own probe into the matter would continue.
"This doesn't change our commitment and determination to understand exactly what happened and make sure it doesn't happen again," said a spokesman.
"We are continuing with our investigation in cooperation with the relevant authorities."
The company has been accused of using the personal data of millions of Facebook users to sway the outcome of the US 2016 presidential election and the UK Brexit referendum. (BBC)

## Title: Chandran  Rutnam,  or the Americans
## Section: News Features

Chandran  Rutnam,  or the Americans
	
I cant make movies for any purpose other than entertainment. (Chandran Rutnam)
In Janelaya, which has just about the finest performances that a cast including Tony Ranasinghe and Swineetha Weerasinghe on one hand and Ravindra Randeniya and Anoja Weerasinghe on the other could have had, the director, Chandran Rutnam, doesnt try to hide his inspirations; he practically shows them off for us, making us contemplate its workings from a bullets eye perspective. When the boy, played by Razi Anwer, witnesses the murder from the apartment, the only other witnesses to it are the killers, and us. Its rather obvious, and Rutnam does a good job of erasing away any inessential details and getting right to the encounter between the boy and the assassin (Randeniya, predating his mute performance in Niriellas Siri Medura by two years). The few sequences that elongate the film  as when the boy, thinking that the murderer is on to him, cowers behind his bed, only to have the father open the door, or when he uncovers, incongruously, the skull of the victim at a beach  drag down this sense of pulpy immediacy. But despite that, Janelaya, I think, is Chandrans best work, simply because its mood is dominated by that immediate tone. 
Sri Lankan cinema has historically tended to oscillate between two broad streams; the cinema of France (Renoir, Carn, and Cocteau) on the one hand and, on the other, the cinema of East Europe
Sri Lankan cinema has historically tended to oscillate between two broad streams; the cinema of France (Renoir, Carn, and Cocteau) on the one hand and, on the other, the cinema of East Europe. Somewhere in the sixties and seventies, the former was effectively if not authoritatively superseded by the latter, to such an extent that every artiste who took to the industry had to declare his or her loyalty (in a manner of speaking) to the auteurs of continental cinema. But while the French and the continental directors have exerted and continue to exert their influence on us, I look in vain for a similar set of influences from the Americans. Its only now, with the emergence of a set of movies that cant be classified as either commercial or arty  think of Premaya Nam, with its dazzling, virtuoso editing, or even Aloko Udapadi, with its un-expedient, minimalistic use of digital effects  that we are seeing a resurgence of the Americans among our directors. We continue to make money for the Americans by watching their movies and TV series, but we still refuse, resolutely, to give into their way of making them. 
Entertainment and art
Part of the reason for this, of course, is that we obsess over how we READ INTO movies. Culture, in this country and in many other countries, has effectively bifurcated between entertainment and art. If its difficult to conceive of a fusion between the two, its not because audiences dont look for it, but because directors feel compelled to do away with such a thing. What is forgotten there, of course, is that the West, barring continental Europe (where film industries are financed and subsidised by the State in ways that our country cant match), doesnt care much for whether entertainment and art can be separated; for them, art can only truly be achieved through entertainment, and advertising, far from hindering the progress of art (as some of its critics are wont to say), has actually benefited the industry; weve officially given way to the dazzling, music video- and MTV-inspired sort of making films today. Directors like Guy Ritchie (Snatch, The Man From U.N.C.L.E.) and Tom Ford (A Single Man) and Spike Jonze (Adaptation, Her) have proved that its possible for a director to put out his vision in simple terms while making the rounds at the box office. In this country, on the other hand, vision is seen as something to hide behind, at the cost of making sense to popular audiences. Art has more or less become minoritarian. 
Rutnam entered our industry at a time when our mainstream directors still opted to follow the Indian way of making movies; directors like Robin Tampoe were facing their final years in the profession, the industry was being liberalised, and movies, once thought to be the only art form which could bring communities together, were being handed over in a slipshod, careless way to every other person who had the money (regardless of whether they were able to direct, or script). The years he spent in the United States, at the University of Southern California and the San Francisco Valley College of Law, and later at various studios, from Warner Brothers on wards, were spent eschewing promotion opportunities in favour of learning everything and anything about the mystery, and business, of filmmaking. 
The strategist
Despite his forays into directing movies  and he has made eight of them so far, some good, some not so good, and some expendable  I feel his greatest strength has been as a strategist, with an acute business sense that has helped him, and us, win foreign filmmakers over to Sri Lanka. Ever since he persuaded Bo Dereks husband, John, to shoot Tarzan the Apeman in Sri Lanka, and Steven Spielberg to shoot Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom (which was the only Indiana Jones flick that the critic Pauline Kael liked) in Kandy, the company he built up, Asian Film Location Services, has been pivotal in bringing entertainment and investments to the country. But this side to his career has been written about so often that no one has paid attention to what he thinks about the movies. 
I never subscribed to the East Europeans, he told me the first time we met, and I think that can be traced to the fact that none of his films, not even Road from Elephant Pass, is overtly political. Even a film like Adara Kathawak, his first, with obvious references to Erich Segal and Ryan ONeal and Ali MacGraw and Love Story, refuses to enter the political, regardless of the chauvinist rants and raves of the brother to Menik Kurukulasooriya. What enraptures one even in his most careless constructed sequences  and there are many of them, just as there are many of them in the movies of those temperamentally opposed to his style  are his exuberance and the fact that in them, he is revelling in his inspirations and influences. Prime among those influences has been Hitchcock (whom he met), but a stronger influence was Sergio Leone, who crops up in nearly all my films. The atonality of those works, moreover, dont help us distinguish one from another, because what he works on now is different to what hes worked on before. I think of Spielberg, Lucas, Coppola  the purveyors of the American popular cinema of the seventies and eighties  when I think of this aspect to Rutnams career. He is, I fervently believe, the most atonal director we have. 
Rutnam entered our industry at a time when our mainstream directors still opted to follow the Indian way of making movies; directors like Robin Tampoe were facing their final years in the profession
Because we dont have many good critics, we havent been able to assess Rutnams movies properly. Now heres what I feel about them; they are sincerely felt, but mechanistically made. That mechanistic-ness comes from the years he spent working at various Hollywood studios. I have seen, or rather witnessed, Rutnam shooting a film (Me Wage Adarayak) once; I know the intensity of the discipline that he puts into his job. Directors like to show off. Even in this era, of digital movie-making, they insist on being seen with their viewfinder, because they can project themselves explicitly as the boss. I dont resort to such crude methods because I am confident enough to tell my cast and crew that I am heading them. What youve got to understand about my way of doing things is that for me, the tea boy is as important as the editor. If you cant keep your people happy and well fed, youre really worthless as a director, said Rutnam.
In the end, this style, alien to many in Sri Lanka (who are used to seeing the director as either a recalcitrant dictator or an easygoing auteur), efficient and to the point at one level, results in movies of which their greatest strength is their sincerity. When I say that they seem to be mechanistic, I dont mean to suggest that they dont entertain; far from inducing boredom, they have (here I am thinking of Janelaya, Road from Elephant Pass, Me Wage Adarayak and the parts of According to Matthew I have seen) truly sustained my interest. Me Wage Adarayak, which is the most recent Rutnam movie I saw, some years ago at the Regal, is in this sense more enjoyable than Adara Kathawak (both of them take their basic plot from Love Story), because it exudes a kind of youthfulness that Menik Kurukulasooriya et al could not, and also because it flows so well that, for an instant at least, it loses that sense of being mechanistically planned out. 
Brian De Palma faced criticism throughout his career  as Richard Brody put it in the New Yorker, when considering his body of work as a whole, he is a director more fascinating than great  and what critics said and wrote of De Palma in his time, we can say and write of Rutnam today. But thats hardly fair if we do so while ignoring the efforts he has made  at one point, he was the only man making such efforts  in getting us to watch, and enjoy, the American method of making movies. When Satyajit Ray went to Hollywood, he was taken aback by the politics and the picketing, despite which American directors from his time, like Billy Wilder, were able to project their vision seamlessly. Perhaps weve been so complacent when it comes to the art of making movies that weve chosen to be blind and deaf to the commerce of making them. What Rutnam has done is make us aware of both sides of that coin. For that, and for the many investments hes helped to bring here, we should, I think, be grateful, though being grateful, of course, doesnt mean that we shouldnt be constructive when judging him. He himself put it best: I despise the sneer and the gibe and welcome criticism when it is sincerely articulated. I truly believe that thats what we should give him.

Corruption qualification to get best of ministerial portfolios: Ranjan
	
One wonders whether the main qualification needed to get a cabinet portfolios is engaging in corruption, Deputy Minister Ranjan Ramanayake said yesterday.
Ramanayake came out with this statement responding to the cabinet reshuffle and the reshuffling of state and deputy ministers during the last two days.
I have not been engaged in corruption and had got only a deputy ministers post but I wonder whether the main qualification needed to get cabinet portfolios is engaging in corruption, Mr. Ramanayake said.
I have engaged in fighting against corruption and exposed some corrupt deeds and will do so in the future as well. I dont care whether the people I expose are in the government or in opposition, he added.
Asked whether the present government has enough time to fight corruption he said the government should however work towards eradicating such acts.  My perception is that the present government is better than the previous one as some steps have been taken to avoid corruption though it is not hundred percent successful, he said.
Responding to a question as to why some of the UNP MPs did not participate in the meeting with Prime Minister on Tuesday he said it may be because some of them though there has not been a radical change in the UNP as promised. (Yohan Perera and Chathuranga Samarawickrama)

MP Athureliye Rathana Thera said that when he made inquiries from President Maithripala Sirisena on the ban on Glyphosate being lifted, he had been informed that he was not aware of such a move.
The Thera charged that only Minister Navin Dissanayake had confirmed the news on the ban and added the public does not know who to believe in this regard and that an important decision such as this cannot be taken without the concurrence of the President and his secretary and therefore it appears that the ban had not been lifted.
He further said a Presidential election or a general election should be called or in the alternative, an announcement should be made on permanent policy decisions covering the next two years instead of putting the people into difficulty".
The Thera made these remarks at the International Buddhist Forum organized by the Environmentally focused Sustainable Development Unity, held yesterday at "Sadaham Sevana".
He added this is a government and individual needs do not matter here. There may be gains, but decisions should not be taken for personal gain.

France to step up security after May Day violence
	

REUTERS, 02nd MAY, 2018- France will increase police numbers for the next round of protests over economic reforms after violent clashes marred the annual May Day rally in Paris, interior minister Gerard Collomb said on Wednesday.
Police said 109 people had been held in custody after Tuesdays clashes, when masked and hooded anarchists hijacked the traditional May 1 rally held by labor unions, smashing shop windows and torching cars in parts of Paris.
Further demonstrations are planned later this week, in protest against economic reform plans by French President Emmanuel Macron.
There will be an even greater number of security forces ... who will aim to separate those who wish to demonstrate from those who wish to vandalize, Collomb told France 2 television on Wednesday.
Collomb defended how the police had handled the demonstration on Tuesday, although opposition politicians criticized the government for not having done enough to prevent the violence.

GMOA warns of TU action without prior notice
	
The Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) today said it would launch a countrywide work stoppage next week without prior notice in protest of several issues including the proposed Kotelawala National Defence University (KNDU) Bill and recently signed Free Trade Agreement (FTA) inked with Singapore.
GMOA Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge told a news conference that its Central Committee (CC) which met this morning had unanimously arrived to this decision and added that the CC had authorised its Executive Committee (Ex-Co) to take final decision on the work stoppage.
He said they had reached to this decision with the absence of a justifiable response from the related authorities for several burning issues in the country including proposed KNDU Bill, FTA inked with Singapore, Economic and Technology Cooperative Agreement (ETCA) with India and the new Inland Revenue Act with would discourage professionals to serve in the country.
Another issue is Health Minister Rajitha Senaratnes arbitrary behaviour relating the cancellation of Sri Lanka Medical Councils (SLMC) election. There are several problems with regard to the transport facilities of medical officers and transfer schemes which have not yet been addressed by the authorities, he said.
He said the GMOA would take actions to make people aware of the KNDU Bill and to defeat it. He also said legal actions would be taken against the FTA inked with Singapore and ETCA with India.
We are forced to launch a countrywide work stoppage over these issues with the absence of a positive response from the authorities. Accordingly, we will go for a work stoppage without prior notice at any moment. The final decision will be decided by the Ex-Co in coming days, he said. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)

32 kg of gold smuggled from SL seized in Chennai
	
Indian Law Enforcement Authorities today seized 32.249 kg of gold valued at Sri Lankan Rs. 240 million smuggled to Chennai from Sri Lanka through coastal Tamil Nadu.
It was smuggled into India by sea and being transported to Chennai for sale.
Six people were apprehended in connection with the case and all of them in their statements admitted that they purposely transported the smuggled gold to Chennai.
On Tuesday evening, DRI officials kept a strict vigil in the bylanes of Mannady and observed a person on a two-wheeler receiving a heavy suspicious looking package.
The receiver of the contraband was apprehended by the officials. After detailed examination the gold was found to weigh 12.149 kg.
The accused were staying in a budget lodge at Mannady. DRI officials found a lady passenger carrying the smuggled gold and handing it over to another intermediary who had been staying at the lodge.
In an similar incident, DRI conducted a thorough search of a private bus moving from Keelakarai to Chennai, where a person was suspected of carrying smuggled gold. The officials quickly identified him and his baggage and recovered 8.1 kg of gold from him.
In all the operations, a total 32.249 kg of gold was seized and six persons were arrested by DRI under the provisions of the Customs Act.
DRI warned that gold smuggling has been a recurrent issue in South India, and the coastal areas of Tamil Nadu are particularly prone to this illicit activity, due to its geographical proximity to Sri Lanka.
The previous year itself saw DRI Chennai Zonal Unit seizing more than 105 kg of gold smuggled via Sri Lanka through the Tamil Nadu coast.
The areas most vulnerable to smuggling are Tiruchendur, Rameswaram and Vedaranyam.
Apart from the enforcement measures, the DRI has also taken up the issues of smuggling and other customs related matters at the policy level during the 28th Indo-Sri Lanka DG Level talks at New Delhi in February this year.
As a result, both administrations had firmly resolved to combat smuggling. The Sri Lanka Customs and the Sri Lankan Navy have also stepped up efforts to curb smuggling of gold, narcotics, and other contraband.
In April, Sri Lanka increased the rate of import duty of gold to 15 per cent (from the earlier rate of 10 per cent), in an attempted move to curb smuggling. (India Today)

Law and Order Minister Ranjith Maddumabandara said today that he had instructed to conduct formal and rapid investigation into the incident involving the loss of Ranamayura Golden Peacock Award of the late filmmaker Dr Lester James Peries that was stolen from his residence.
The award was stolen Wednesday morning while his funeral service was in progress.
The minister said he had instructed the police to conduct an investigation under a Deputy Inspector General (DIG).
 If the award was stolen by someone intentionally it was an insult to humanity more than a theft, the minister said.
He said the persons involved in the incident would be identified within a short period because investigations are being carried out on a number of areas.
Earlier, National Film Corporation Chairman Sithendra Senaratne said he had informed the Law and Order Minister Ranjith Madduma Bandara and the Colombo South Police DIG about this theft.
The Ranamayura Award was given to Mr Peries in 1965 at the India International Film Festival held in New Delhi for the film Gamperaliya, he said.(Darshana Sanjeewa)

Milk powder shortage in fortnight: Importers
	
Milk powder importers said yesterday they stopped importing milk powder from last week following its increase in the world market.
The cost of one metric ton of milk powder in the world market is US$ 3,250-3,350. It can go up to US$ 3,400-3,500 by June. Against this backdrop, we requested the Consumer Affairs Authority (CAA) and the Cost of Living Committee to increase the price of one kilo of imported milk powder by Rs.100 to cover up importer costs. The sudden stoppage of importing new stocks has been informed to Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, they said.
This decision was taken considering the dollar increment of milk powder stocks in the world market and inflation of the dollar against the rupee.
Milk powder stocks available in the local market will be sufficient only for the next two or three weeks. Afterwards, there will be a shortage, the importers said.
Hence, they request the CAA and the Cost of Living Committee to grant them a price hike of at least Rs.75 per kilo of milk powder. (Chaturanga Samarawickrama)

Netanyahu accuses Palestinian leader of anti-Semitism, Holocaust denial
	

REUTERS, 02nd MAY, 2018- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu accused Mahmoud Abbas of anti-Semitism and Holocaust denial on Wednesday after the Palestinian leader suggested in a speech that historic persecution of European Jews had been caused by their conduct.
Jewish groups also condemned Abbas comments, made in a speech on Monday to the Palestinian National Council, that Jews had suffered historically not because of their religion but because they had been bankers and money lenders. It would appear that, once a Holocaust denier, always a Holocaust denier, Netanyahu said on Twitter.
I call upon the international community to condemn the grave anti-Semitism of Abu Mazen (Abbas), which should have long since passed from this world.
Abbas said in his speech that Jews living in Europe had suffered massacres every 10 to 15 years in some country since the 11th century and until the Holocaust. Citing books written by various authors, Abbas argued: They say hatred against Jews was not because of their religion, it was because of their social profession. So the Jewish issue that had spread against the Jews across Europe was not because of their religion, it was because of usury and banks.
Netanyahus criticism was echoed by Jewish leaders around the world.
Abbas speech in Ramallah are the words of a classic anti-Semite, said Marvin Hier and Abraham Cooper of the U.S.-based Jewish human rights organization the Simon Wiesenthal Center.

He said he did not believe the Ministry of Agriculture, that deals closely with farmers who toil day and day out to feed the country and their problems would need a highly luxurious and huge building paying a colossal amount of money as rent.

President instructs officials to suspend STC Chairman, Presidential Secretary
	
President Maithripala Sirisena today instructed officials to suspend the services of a senior official attached to the Presidential Secretariat and the Chairman of the State Timber Corporation (STC) who were facing bribery allegations and advised the authorities to strictly enforce the law against the two offenders.
Statement issued by the Presidents Media Division said the decision was taken after the arrest of the two top officials.
This confirms the importance of establishing independent commissions and implementing the policies of the Government against bribery and corruption, the statement further said.
It also said that the President was pleased with the independent and impartial background created by the present government to ensure that the law enforcement authorities are able to perform their duties independently. (Chaturanga Samarawickrama)

Presidents Chief of Staff Mahanama, STC Chairman arrested
	
The Presidents Chief of Staff I. H. K. Mahanama and State Timber Corporation (STC) Chairman P. Dissanayaka were arrested by the Bribery Commission this evening in the act of accepting a bribe of Rs.20 million from an Indian businessman.
A Bribery Commission official said the businessman, who had purchased a land at the Kantale Sugar Factory, had wanted to purchase machinery and building space to start operating the factory.
The suspects had solicited a bribe of Rs.540 million from the businessman promising that they would provide him with the approval needed to obtain machinery and building space for this purpose. However, after negotiations were held between the two parties, it was decided to reduce the asking price to Rs.100 million.
The raid took place while the two suspects were accepting Rs. 20 million as an advance payment in the car park of a leading luxury hotel in Colombo yesterday. The officials said the suspects were in the process of counting the money at the time of the arrest.
The main suspect, Dr Mahanama, was earlier the Secretary to the Ministry of Lands and Parliamentary Reforms. He was appointed as the Presidents Chief of Staff two months ago but had told the businessman he still had the power to obtain the approval that was needed.
Officials of the Bribery Commission said the suspects would be produced before the Colombo Chief Magistrate after their statements were recorded.
The second suspect, P. Dissanayake, was formerly the Secretary to former President Chandrika Kumaratunga. (Darshana Sanjeewa)

Presidential powers need to be pruned - Tilvin Silva
	
JVP General Secretary Tilvin Silva, in an interview with Daily Mirror, speaks about his partys initiative to bring a constitutional amendment for the abolition of executive presidency. The excerpts:-
President is Head of State only
	President to be elected not by public vote but by Parliament
	PM is the Head of Government
	UNP cantwipe off its hands now
	Prez has no governmental power


Q How do you i ntend to amend the executive presidency, technically speaking
We have prepared a draft. According to it, some powers vested with the executive President will be transferred to the Cabinet and the Prime Minister. Likewise some powers of the executive President are proposed to be assigned to the Constitutional Council and the Independent Commissions appointed by it. The President will also retain some powers. It is not just the transfer of powers from one person with executive authority to another. It is the transfer of power to various bodies and individuals  the Cabinet, the Prime Minister, the Constitutional Council and the Independent Commissions. 
Q What are the fresh powers to be assigned to the Prime Minister in terms of the proposed amendment to the Constitution
We are in the process of working out it in an orderly fashion. 
Q Currently, the President is the Head of State. What will happen to that position if the new amendment is incorporated into the Constitution
As per the current Constitution, the President is both the Head of State and the Head of Cabinet. Yet, we propose the President to be the Head of State and the Prime Minister to be the Head of Cabinet. 
As the Head of State, the President will continue to be involved in state affairs and the Commander in Chief of Armed Forces. Yet, he will not be the Head of the Cabinet. Also, the President is not to be elected by a public vote. It is a post to be elected by Parliament within one month upon its formation. 
Q The Constitutional Councils already holds authority on some key affairs previously done by the executive President. What are the new areas of power to be added to the Constitutional Council
We have to consolidate the Constitutional Council further. You asked about new additions. That is still under discussion. 
Q Currently, the President is not only the Commander in Chief but also the Defence Minister. He can hold ministerial posts. What do you propose under the new amendment
Our position is that the President should not hold ministerial posts. 
Q How far have you progressed in evolving this piece of new legislation to be introduced as an Amendment to the Constitution
We have finished bulk of it. Actually, we have finished legal formatting of the draft. Yet, we have to look at the political aspect of this. We hope we will be able to present the draft for consideration in May. 
Q Who is working out this Bill on behalf of the party
There are several drafts presented in regards to the amendment of executive presidency in the past. We studied all of them. We have a whole lot of lawyers supporting our party. We got their assistance. Besides, there are our own members having an idea about it. They are all involved in drafting this. We have to make finishing touches to the basic draft.
Q There is a school of thought that the abolition of executive presidency would affect the unitary status of the country. Currently, the executive presidency can some hold over the affairs provincial councils, by appointing the provincial governors. Once that safeguarding is removed, the provinces would enjoy greater autonomy. What are your views on this
Such criticism is made by some even without having a look at this draft. It is not yet available for anyone to peruse. Once it is available, anybody can propose changes. We wish to say that the Provincial Governors would continue to have the same powers. The President would continue to have powers for their appointments. Then, the question does not arise.
Q The President is to be appointed by Parliament under the proposed Constitutional Amendment. Then, the party in power always has the chance of getting the President appointed in their favour. How do you see this
Except on special occasions, the President and the PM have represented the same party in Sri Lanka. When the President is appointed by Parliament, the same would happen. 
Q What are the constitutional models you looked at in working out this amendment
We did not try to replicate the model of any country in this instance. We studied the models in a number of countries. The presidential system is in practice even in some parts of Europe. In India, the PM is the Head of State. It is a country that has devolved powers to various states. 
The current electoral system is better than the First Past the Post System in terms of democracy. We need a departure from the fraudulent political culture of this country. Today, stable governments cannot be formed, not because of the electoral system but because of the prevailing fraudulent political culture.
Q In the Indian Constitution, there are strong unitary features. Did you study them
We are not making a new Constitution. We only make a new amendment to the existing Constitution. There was the need for a new Constitution. There was a process initiated for it. We were also party to it. Yet, the constitution making process has been abandoned now. Therefore, we want to secure, at least, the abolition of executive presidency. Criticism levelled against our initiative is not constructive or justifiable. The JVP was opposed to the executive presidency right from its inception. After 1994, all the main parties promised to abolish it. All the Presidents, elected since then, pledged to do it. Today, some persons, who worked out manifestos for such Presidents in this respect, are critical of our move to abolish the executive presidency. Therefore, their arguments are not realistic. They did not take the same line of thinking at that time. It is nothing but hypocrisy and narrow-mindedness. 
Q This is a topic discussed in political circles for decades. Yet, what prompted you to move the amendment at this juncture
First, the parties have promised to abolish the system. But, when in power, they have always acted in contrast. Now, we have reached a point of no return. In the run up to the last presidential elections, this was a key pledge made by President Maithripala Sirisena. He vowed to do it besides the coffin of Ven. Maduluwave Sobhitha Thera. Yet, the government has abandoned the process. We cannot allow the government to play its game in this regard. The JVP took the initiative as a result. We are doing something long overdue. 
Secondly, we believe the current political composition is ideal for the purpose. Political equation is well-suited for it. Instead of a strong single party government, we have a coalition government at the helm of affairs. This is the ideal time to get something done in this regard. We have to manoeuvre the situation for the benefit of the country. 
Q The JVP is trying to bring this legislation as a private members Bill since it has hardly become part of the countrys law. How hopeful are you of getting this enacted into a law
It is up to Parliament. We will only move this in Parliament. This will get enacted in Parliament as one option or defeated. If it is defeated, it would expose political skulduggery of those concerned. We will do our duty. 
Q Have you initiated any dialogue with other parties in this regard
Actually, we had a round of talks about a year ago. We had talks with President Maithripala Sirisena, the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) and, Sri Lanka Muslim Congress (SLMC). We had reached a rough agreement. We are now ready for talks with all those concerned - the political parties and civil society heads etc. Already, former President Mahinda Rajapaksa has made remarks in favour of our initiative. Some members of his side have opposed to it, though. 
Q What is the support you get from the United National Party (UNP)
There is no definite idea expressed. Some within the party are supportive of it. The UNP has passed a resolution, on one occasion to abolish the executive presidential system. The UNP had the same stand in the run up to the presidential election. The UNP cannot wipe off its hands now.
Q Minister Mano Ganeshan is opposed to the abolition of executive presidency. He said the people of the entire country could participate in the election of the President as voters of one whole electorate. He argued that it could offer a platform for national unity in that sense. What are your comments on this
We dont believe the executive presidency can bring about national harmony. It has been in practice for 40 years. Instead, it created a wedge between the communities. Executive powers were abused to set ablaze the Jaffna library. The 1983 ethnic riots took place with the patronage of executive powers. The executive powers were used to buy over the parties representing different ethnicities. For small parties, the presidential election is the best opportunity to flaunt some bargaining power and to get some personal benefits. 
Q At the last election, it was the union of different political parties and individuals that brought about the regime change. The parties representing the Tamil and Muslim communities played a pivotal role in this exercise. The composition of the current parliament is also a direct result of that union. Do you agree
One cannot take this Parliament as an example. There is distortion of it. If you look at the previous Parliaments, there was no contribution from the executive presidency to bring about national harmony. 
Q In the current political context, the parties representing Muslims and Tamils have become the forces to reckon with in the election of the President. Your views on this...
The current context is not something everlasting. It is only an occasional phenomenon. We do not think it would be the same in the future. There is a possibility of dangerous leaders ascending to high political office in the future. These minority leaders may not be able to deal with such leaders.
Q Whom do you refer to as dangerous leaders
After becoming the executive presidents, most leaders turned out to be dangerous. The past leaders such as JR Jayewardene and R. Premadasa conducted themselves like this. The rule of Mahinda Rajapaksa smacked of dictatorial characteristics. There are certain names being mentioned these days. If such persons come to power, we can sense what would follow.
Q What do you feel about President Sirisena as a ruler in that context
We cannot take him as an example here. He is the President. But, he has no governmental power. It is with another party. Also, some of his powers were pruned under the 19th Amendment. Otherwise, we could have been able to see the real nature of the current President. The 19A took away his power to dissolve Parliament. Otherwise, he could have dissolved Parliament by now. So, he prorogued Parliament, instead. 
Q It is very difficult to get a stable Parliament elected under the current electoral system. If the executive presidency is also abolished, how would it affect the countrys stability
The current electoral system is better than the First Past the Post System in terms of democracy. We need a departure from the fraudulent political culture of this country. Today, stable governments cannot be formed, not because of the electoral system but because of the prevailing fraudulent political culture. We see the culture of political crossovers. It has to be changed. If somebody proposes to stop crossovers, we will agree to it. There is a culture of politicians being bought over. 
As for the local government elections, the real problem is there in the political culture, not in the electoral system. If there is a decent political culture, the party that gets the majority should be allowed to form administration. Now, the defeated party tries to form administration by luring members from other side through the offer of inducements.

Press Freedom and Enforced Disappearances Cries for justice that dont echo loud
	
This article is part of a series of stories andop-eds launched by IPS on the occasion of World Press Freedom Day on May 3.
When Sri Lankan journalist Richard de Zoysa was abducted from his home in Colombo on the night of February 18th, 1990, his family knew there would be dark days ahead.
The population was still reeling from one of the bloodiest episodes in the island nations history  a Government counterinsurgency campaign to crush a Marxist rebellion in southern Sri Lanka, which left between 30,000 and 60,000 people dead at the hands of Government death squads. 
Even more disturbing than the extrajudicial killings was the wave of enforced disappearances that took place between 1988 and 1990; tens of thousands of Sinhalese men and boys suspected of being members or sympathizers of the Peoples Liberation Front, or JVP, went missing, never to return. 
At the time of his kidnapping, de Zoysa was a stringer for this publication, filing regular reports on the political violence plaguing the country. He was on the verge of accepting the post of Bureau Chief of the agencys Lisbon-based European desk when the goons came knocking. 
For hours that bled into days, his mother, Manorani Saravanamuttu had no idea what had become of him. High-ranking officials assured her that he was alive, in police custody, but refused to give her exact coordinates when she asked to be allowed to bring him some clothing  he had been wearing only a sarong when he was kidnapped  or a meal. 
The decisions of Tamil families to spend day after day in the burning sun by the side of polluted, dusty highways and roads is indicative of their lack of faith in Government mechanisms
It later transpired that while she was making frantic phone calls and searching for answers, de Zoysa was already dead, shot in the head at point blank range, and his body dumped in the Indian Ocean, a tactic that had become a common feature of the Governments systematic abductions. 
A fisherman happened to recognize his face  de Zoysa was also a well-known television personality at the time  when his body washed up on shore in a coastal town just south of the capital. He alerted the authorities who in turn contacted de Zoysas mother. 
According to a 1991 Washington Post interview with Saravanamuttu, the discovery of her sons body was a turning point, for her personally, and for the nation as a whole. When she walked out of the inquest a few days after de Zoysas abduction, she found herself surrounded by reporters, to whom she made a statement that resonated with countless families across the island: I am the luckiest mother in Sri Lanka. I got my sons body back. There are thousands of mothers who never get their childrens bodies back. 
Mothers of the Disappeared
Saravanamuttus statement quickly catalyzed a movement known as the Mothers Front, which had been a long time coming. Perhaps due to her privileged status as a member of the countrys English-speaking elite, she became a kind of totem pole around which women from the poorer, politically marginalized and largely Sinhala-speaking rural belt could gather, and from which they could draw strength. By 1991, according to the Post, the Mothers Front counted 25,000 registered members. 
The movement didnt succeed in bringing justice to many of its victims. To this day, not a single person has been convicted for de Zoysas murder. Ministers who opposed Saravanamuttu and attempts by others to seek answers in the murders or disappearances of their loved ones continue to hold positions of power within the Government  Ranil Wickremesinghe, who the Post quoted as brushing de Zoysas murder off as suicide or something else, now serves as the Prime Minister, the second-highest political office in the country. 
Amnesty International estimates that since the 1980s, there have been as many as 100,000 enforced disappearances in Sri Lanka. The Mothers Front movement did, however, make a crucial contribution to the countrys political landscape, one which continues to have ramifications today; it tied together forever the plight of Sri Lankas disappeared with the fate of its journalists and press freedom  or the lack thereof. 
Exactly 20 years after de Zoysa was assassinated, another journalists disappearance prompted a woman to step into the global spotlight, much as Saravanamuttu did back in the 90s. This journalists name is Prageeth Eknaligoda, and he was last seen on January 24th, 2010. He telephoned his wife, Sandhya, around 10 p.m. to inform her that he was on his way home from the offices of Lanka eNews (LEN), where he was a renowned columnist and cartoonist. He never arrived. 
From local police stations all the way to the United Nations in Geneva, Sandhya has searched for answers as to his whereabouts. It is only in the past two years that some information regarding his abduction and detention by army intelligence personnel has been revealed. 
Both Saravanamuttu and Sandhya have received international recognition for their tireless campaigning.
Tamil Womenin the North
Sandhya has also been one of the few women, and one of the lone voices, connecting the issue of press freedom with the movement of families of the disappeared led by Tamil women in Sri Lankas northern province, where the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) waged a 28-year-long guerilla war. 
Since January 2017, hundreds of Tamil civilians have observed continuous, 24-hour roadside protests in five key locations throughout the former war zone  Kilinochchi, Mullaithivu, Trincomalee, Vavuniya and Maruthankerny (Jaffna District)  demanding answers for their disappeared loved ones. 
Like the Mothers Front in the 1990s, this movement too has been several years in the making. When the civil war ended in 2009, some 300,000 Tamil civilians were rounded up and detained in open-air camps, while hundreds of others  particularly men who surrendered to the armed forces  were taken into Government custody under suspicion of being members or supporters of the LTTE. 
But while the camps have closed and a large number of people reunited with their families, an estimated 20,000 people are still unaccounted for. 
In 2016, Parliament passed a bill to establish an Office of Missing Persons (OMP) tasked with investigating what Foreign Minister Mangala Samaraweera called one of the largest caseloads of missing persons in the world. 
But these cosmetic measures have failed to yield concrete results. 
In an interview with IPS, Ruki Fernando, a Colombo-based activist who has been visiting the protests in the northern province, noted that the decisions of Tamil families to spend day after day in the burning sun by the side of polluted, dusty highways and roads is indicative of their lack of faith in Government mechanisms like the OMP and the judiciary to bring them relief. He also called attention to the dismal levels of support or solidarity they have received from Sri Lankas broader civil society, including from English and Sinhala-language media or womens groups in the capital. 
Its not fair that these families  particularly elderly Tamil women who are leading the protests  should have to carry this burden alone. They have already suffered heavily during the war they starved in bunkers, didnt have medication for injuries and have lost family members. All these factors have made them physically weak and emotionally vulnerable, yet now they are also shouldering the burden of keeping these protests going, said Fernando.
In my memory, such a strong movement led by women, occurring simultaneously in five locations across the North and East, or any region, is unprecedented, Fernando said adding And yet it has not become a priority for the rest of the country. 
He called Sandhyas participation in the protests as a Sinhala Buddhist ally an exception to the rule of general indifference, which he chalked up to a combination of political and ideological issues. 
Some people believe these protests are too radical, too politicized, that there should be more cooperation with, and less criticism of, the Government, he explained. But as Fernando himself noted in an article for Groundviews-one of Sri Lankas leading citizen journalism websites- Tamil families have met repeatedly with elected officials, including President Maithripala Sirisena, to no avail. 
Exactly 20 years after de Zoysa was assassinated, another journalists disappearance prompted a woman to step into the global spotlight, much as Saravanamuttu didback in the 90s.
No closure
Fernando is not the only one to draw attention to the disadvantaged position Tamil families are in with regard to both deaths and disappearances. 
Another person to make this connection was Lal Wickrematunge, the brother of journalist Lasantha Wickrematunge, former editor-in-chief of The Sunday Leader who was murdered in broad daylight in 2010, and whose killers still havent been brought to justice. 
Lal pointed to the ongoing investigation by the Criminal Investigation Department into military intelligence officers involvement in the kidnapping and torture of former Deputy Editor of The Nation newspaper, Keith Noyahr  and the arrest earlier this month of Major General Amal Karunasekera in connection with multiple attacks on journalists, including Noyahr, and Lasantha as a possible avenue of closure for the families. 
According to a recent report in Sunday Observer, The assault on former Rivira Editor Upali Tennakoon and the abduction of journalist and activist Poddala Jayantha are also linked to the same shadowy military intelligence networks. 
Suresh Kumar and Ranjith Kumar were both employees of the Jaffna-based Tamil-language daily Uthayan, whose employees and offices have been attacked multiple times, according to the Committee toProtect Journalists. 
For Fernando, the task of keeping the torch lit for Sri Lankas dead and disappeared cannot be laid at the feet of their family members alone  it is a responsibility that the entire country must share. 
What we need first and foremost are independent institutions capable of meting out truth and justice and winning the confidence of the families. And secondly, there is a need for stronger support for the families of victims from the civil society  activists and professionals like lawyers, journalists and womens groups.said Fernando.

## Title: Reshuffling incompetency, inefficiency and insecurity

Reshuffling incompetency, inefficiency and insecurity
	
Exactly one year ago, just after the joint opposition picked up the gauntlet thrown by the Yahapalana Government (that of filling Galle Face Green on May Day) and put up an unprecedented show of force, I posted the following comment on Facebook: pef,aka tlla wjYH k fukak( tcdmfha fyda cfm fyda Y%S,xksmfha 2018 uehs k fIda tl f.da,a f*aia tfla ;shkak (If you are looking for a challenge, heres one: let the UNP or SLFP or JVP hold the 2018 May Day rally at Galle Face).
I doubt the good people who lead these parties even heard about this challenge, but the fact is that none of them had the guts to say, Well take Galle Face Green. No guts or worse still, no numbers. The last, that of declining popularity, is the backdrop against which we have to consider a couple of statements made by the leaders of the United National Party (UNP) and the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP).
President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe made some honest observations at Hulftsdorp at a ceremony to mark the 25th anniversary of President Ranasinghe Premadasas assassination. Sirisena said Sri Lanka is currently facing various problems because of the personal agendas of politicians, and Wickremesinghe opined, there is no alternative to the national government. [Please note that Wickremesinghe was alluding to the idea or concept of a national government and not the Yahapalana Regime.]
The entire saga of the Cabinet reshuffle (which was many times announced, partially attempted and re-attempted) speak to and confirm both statements. Lets start with Wickremesinghes contention.
He has not specified who is not offering an alternative to the (idea) national government. Is he alluding to detractors within the party, those who believe the UNP can go it alone or those few remaining Sirisena-loyalists in the SLFP It cant be the JO or the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) or the majority of the voters; theyve all said in word and vote that the Yahapalanists could go home. He has to be talking about his own regime; well, his and Sirisenas. They simply dont have any other option but to go along with the idea of a national government.
A national government, as per the 19th Amendment, is what allows Wickremesinghe to satisfy the ministerial aspirations of more than 30 MPs and thereby keep the detractors within the party at bay. For this he needs the SLFP. It also helps Sirisena retain some vestige of relevance because his loyalists get portfolios. 
This brings us to Sirisenas assertion; that of personal agendas of politicians. He may have wanted people to think hes talking about the JO or the SLPP, but maybe he ought to have given a bit of thought to what he was going to say before he said it. Sirisena ought to know about agendas. Personal agendas. He should know about the personal agendas of his friends or lets say fellow-travellers or strange bedfellows. 
Thats exactly whats happening even today. Instead of addressing the problem, Sirisena and Wickremesinghe, presumably out of their wits over political survival, are trying to make out that the ship has not hit the iceberg
We need not elaborate. Whats more productive would be to talk about the true dilemmas of these two men in the matter of reshuffling. Perhaps the wry observation posted by someone on Facebook captures the situation best: This is like shuffling deck chairs on the Titanic to avoid the iceberg. Could be worse of course: Its like shuffling deck chairs after hitting the iceberg. 
President Sirisenas promise to reshuffle scientifically is being lampooned in style right now. It is being ridiculed in terms of the ministry titles and the track-records of those given portfolios. Some of this is wicked, some of it is funny, but most of it is spot on. We need not elaborate. 
Its about competency (or lack thereof), efficiency (or lack thereof) and security, the last referring to the anxieties of regime leaders with respect to political survival. Taking a portfolio from one incompetent and/or corrupt minister and giving him or her another wont sort out anything. When incompetent and/or corrupt MPs outnumber those who are competent, and when loyalty is also factored in you are not going to see anything radically different to what youve already seen. When you dont have the science to understand that all state institutions can be sorted among as few as 10 ministries, you are not going to have a scientific reshuffle.
Around ten years ago Nahil Wijesuriya made a caustic remark about Cabinet portfolios which is as relevant today: When you go to Galle on the Southern Expressway its under one minister; when you return its another. He added this: I understand that politicians need perks, they want certain luxuries. I say, give it to them; only, tell them not to do a stroke of work! He was referring to the redundancies, the overlapping and such which compound the problem of inefficiency, incompetence and corruption. 
Thats exactly whats happening even today. Instead of addressing the problem, Sirisena and Wickremesinghe, presumably anxious out of their wits over political survival, are trying to make out that the ship has not hit the iceberg. Ok, lets be generous. They want us to believe that the waters ahead hold no icebergs or sea monsters. The problem is that few are buying their words these days. 
They have alienated themselves from the voter. Theyve failed to purchase the trust and backing of the public servants with the Rs 10,000 salary hike. Indeed, theyve alienated the most honourable and competent among the public servants thanks to their fascination with the politics of patronage, the rewarding of loyalists and punishing of those who will not toe the line. The case of Senior DIG Latheef tells that story well. 
At the end of the day, it really boils down to this: if you shuffle incompetence, inefficiency, insecurity, corruption, vindictiveness and such, thats what you will get at shuffle-end. The incompetent, inefficient, insecure, corrupt and vindictive have moved to different chairs on the deck of a ship that doesnt seem to be going anywhere in a hurry or worse, appears to be sinking.

Right of reply Why the GoSL sponsored  Resolution 30/1
	
A Response to Sunil Chandrakumaras interview which was published on the April 6th issue of the Daily Mirror: Legal and Factual ClarificationsM. Fernando, Z. Husain, N. Jayakody
On the 6th of April, thepublished an interview with Global Sri Lankan Forums (GSLF) President, Sunil Chandrakumara. The interview was about GSLFs involvement in the UN Human Rights Council (UNHRC) process and Sri Lankas transitional justice agenda more broadly. This interview had numerous contentious statements, but in this response, we will focus on legal and factual errors made by Chandrakumara concerning UNHRC Resolution 30/1 and the OISL report, the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearances Act (Enforced Disappearance Act), and the Office on Missing Persons (OMP). 
Resolution 30/1 and OISL report
Chandrakumara makes several misleading claims about Resolution 30/1 and the OISL report. He firstly claims that Government sponsorship of 30/1 was anti-national. However, by co-sponsoring 30/1 the Government of Sri Lanka took ownership of its own post-conflict processes, demonstrating domestic control over matters that would otherwise remain international. This includes control over processes that may have international participation. This is evidenced further as 30/1 reaffirms its commitment to the sovereignty, independence, unity and territorial integrity of Sri Lanka. Additionally, by sponsoring 30/1 the Government was able to affirm Sri Lankas place as a responsible, confident and peaceful nation among the community of nations. This is necessary for the country to acquire tangible economic gains as well as socio-political benefits, such as Sri Lankas recent reentry into the GSP+ system. Therefore, the Sri Lankan Governments co-sponsoring of 30/1 and the commitment to its goals cannot be viewed as anti-national. Though Chandrakumara did not define what he meant by anti-national, the definition for pro-national we are using here are processes that allow for the domestic ownership of post-conflict measures, and that are in the best interest of allSri Lankans. 
Chandrakumara also goes on to claim that the Government acknowledged false allegations in Resolution 30/1, as the OISL report included biased assumptions and followed non-standard practices. For example, he claims there was a lack of verification of the evidence and witness testimonies, and that the reports conclusions were therefore ill-founded. In fact, the OISL report adhered to an internationally recognised legal framework for investigations. The report was mandated to include incidents where there were reasonable grounds to believe the incident occurred with sufficiently corroborated information. Secondly, the investigators organised comprehensive witness interviews from victims in 11 countries; and reviewed 3000 written statements and submissions, audio-visual and satellite materials and other relevant information from various sources including public reports, Government statements, military statements and authentic unpublished official documents. Should there be any shortcomings in the report, it may be because the report was constrained by non-cooperation from the Government of Sri Lanka, lack of access to
Sri Lanka and protection concerns for victims and witnesses. 
Chandrakumara then moves to mischaracterize the work of the OMP. He states that this special office has been established to investigate complaints received from the Northern and the Eastern provinces.
Enforced Disappearance Act
Chandrakumara then goes on to make assertions about Sri Lankas recent Enforced Disappearances Act. He argues that the Act is against national interest. The Act criminalises all forms of deprivation of liberty where these acts of deprivation have not been disclosed or have been concealed. This legislation aims to tackle Sri Lankas legacy of enforced disappearances that have plagued all communities since the mid 1980s and its white van culture, as well as ensure that all Sri Lankans can live without fear of these acts. This cannot be against the national interest! 
Chandrakumara also argues that the Act undermines state sovereignty. However, the Act authorises Sri Lankan institutions to investigate, prosecute and try cases of enforced disappearances. An Act that empowers Sri Lankan institutions cannot threaten state sovereignty. While the Act does leave room for Sri Lankan nationals to be extradited to third countries, legal commentators have argued that such a scenario is highly unlikely when the domestic courts themselves have jurisdiction to try these matters. To illustrate, despite Sri Lankas Convention Against Torture Act already providing for extradition of Sri Lankan nationals to third countries to be tried for the offence of torture, no Sri Lankan has been extradited by the authorities to date. This is because domestic courts have the capacity to try these offenders locally.
The interviewee further claims that the Act will be used to punish the political leadership that oversaw the conclusion of the war. The Act stipulates that the law shall only come into force on the date of certification. It does not have retroactive applicability, meaning that only cases of enforced disappearance committed after the law entered into force in March 2018 are prosecutable. Finally, Chandrakumara makes reference to commissioners who have been appointed to oversee this specific Act. Here, Chandrakumara has confused the OMP with the Enforced Disappearances Act - two distinct legal instruments. The responsibility for prosecuting alleged perpetrators for crimes that occur in Sri Lanka under the Enforced Disappearance Act rests with local prosecutors and not with OMP commissioners, who can only pass on relevant information they have to prosecuting authorities, where it is in consultation with relatives of the victims and in theirbest interest.
Office on Missing Persons
Chandrakumara then moves to mischaracterize the work of the OMP. He states that this special office has been established to investigate complaints received from the Northern and the Eastern provinces. This is a misconstruction of the OMP Act since it does not restrict the OMP to receiving or investigating complaints from only these two provinces. In fact, individuals or organisations from any province in Sri Lanka can submit a complaint to the OMP about a person who has gone missing during the ethnic conflict (including members of the armed forces and police), a period of political unrest, civil disturbance or due to anenforced disappearance. 
The interviewee also makes this assertion on the unfounded basis that the OMP commissioners would be biased and only select complaints received from the North and East for further investigations. This is incorrect. The OMP Act makes it clear that the OMP commissioners are unlikely to exercise absolute discretion when selecting complaints for further investigations. The OMP Act has guidelines which suggest that priority would need to be given to missing persons cases that have occurred most recently, have substantial existing evidence or are of public importance. Furthermore, it is not in the interest of the commissioners to act in such a biased and irrational manner as their decisions can be reviewed by the Supreme Court. Finally, statements made by the OMP Chairman, and the OMP Act indicate that the OMP is likely to rely on the findings of previous Commissions of Inquiry that looked at enforced disappearances. Therefore, it is very likely that the findings of the three Zonal Commissions of Inquiry, which inquired into enforced disappearances during the 1988/1989 JVP-youth insurrection, would also be considered by the OMP when carrying out its investigations. As such, the interviewees assertion about the OMP commissioners being biased in favour of complaints received from the Northern and Eastern Provinces is legally andfactually unfounded. 
In sum, many of Chandrakumaras statements have little foundation in fact and law. While Chandrakumara is correct in stating that not all discourses at the UNHRC are helpful to Sri Lanka, his own misrepresentations of Sri Lankas post-conflict processes also threaten to undermine the countrys collective goal towards justice and accountability forall communities.

SAITM students psychologically affected: SACS
	
While stating that some SAITM students were psychologically affected due to the prolonged SAITM issue and undergoing medical treatment, the Student Action Committee of SAITM (SACS) urged the government to proceed with the decision to enroll SAITM students to General Sir John Kotelawala Defence University (KDU).
SACS Convener Shanaka De Saram told a news conference that SAITM students had been waiting for a solution to this problem for many years and hoped for a positive end to this issue each time the government announced various policy decisions.
He said the academic activities of SAITM students had come to a standstill and that they were depressed because their future seemed uncertain.
Several students have sought medical treatment for depression. People say we are from affluent families, but only we know the struggle we are going through to earn a medical degree in a private university. The parents of many students have obtained loans to support their childs education, he said.
Meanwhile, the academic staff has been compelled to resign because of financial constraints in paying their salaries and our academic programme is dying a natural death. The fate and future of these students have become uncertain, he said.
He said it was the governments responsibility to resolve this matter and added that the students were thankful to the relevant authorities for agreeing to transfer all students to KDU.
However, to implement this decision, legislative amendments should be made for enrollment as it is a military institute. We are happy that one day we will be able to help our motherland through our expertise. We saved a lot of foreign exchange for the country by joining SAITM which would have otherwise been spent on foreign universities, he said. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)

Superior man and common man
	
The superior man thinks always of virtue; the common man thinks of comfort  Confucius
Three wheelers, no doubt have become much of a headache to motorists and pedestrians. The haphazard driving of three-wheelers often makes the others hope for a day that the government organizes alternative routes for these auto-rickshaws so that the other vehicles can travel on the roads peacefully. Despite the challenges that this small mans transport system poses for motorists one often finds oneself flashing a smile on seeing the funny slogans written mostly on the back of the vehicles or sometimes on the side. These quite humorous mottoes and wisecracks make the usual Pirates of the Caribbean and Bob Marley look of other three-wheelers, dull and colourless. The spelling mistakes only make the slogans sound spicier. 
A three-wheeler that stopped at the road crossing opposite the Faculty of Visual Arts in Horton Place on Tuesday morning displayed this sentence, Do not underestimate the power of the common man on the right side of its roof. Perhaps the owner would have thought of reminding the motorists not to underestimate his vehicle travelling among the sleek and shiny cars and jeeps. However those who are politically conscious may even read it as a warning to the government which does not get on well with the common man these days. With price hikes in essential items, slow development, conflicts between the executive and the legislature; surely theres a long list grievances for the common man. 
However the interchangeable nature of the term common man is such that it certainly makes one confused. For instance a VIP vehicle whizzes past breaking traffic rules turns even a doctor rushing for a surgery or a student rushing to sit the Advanced Level examination a common man. After all the VIP and his guards appear to be thinking that cutting the ribbon at a fancy event on time is the most important, decisive event of the day for the nation. Hence the need to break the rules and speed along lanes in a zigzag pattern paying scant regard to the common man in a car, van, bus, three-wheeler or bike. However if one is to go by the Chinese philosopher turned politician, Confucius, the moment the one inside the VIP vehicle thinks about his own convenience and comfort over the others he reduces to the level of common man. According to Confucius its the common man that thinks of the comfort always while the superior man thinks of virtues. Certainly by breaking traffic regulations and selfishly inconveniencing fellow citizens the VIP becomes disqualified to be a superior man however much he thinks he is. Even otherwise, given the rate of corruption and other self-serving strategies and the links with the underworld and other undesirable elements, the bulk of the politicians, irrespective of party lines, form the most disqualified for the title of a superior man. Comfort, convenience and self-centred calculation are certainly the words that best describe the modern day Sri Lankan politician. 
On the other hand by putting up with political dramas and inflation of the so called representatives of the people till the next general election and also practising the virtue of patience with VIP vehicles and by being large-hearted enough to pave the way for them to pass by without a problem, the common man has certainly turned himself to a superior man. 
With the war being a thing of the past it is however the hope of the superior man that the common man would put an end to the practice of running around the country, especially in the South, with their backups flouting road rules and looking for preferential treatment on the road over the rest of the countrymen.

Tea records highest concentration of Glyphosate: US research
	
Tea is among the agricultural products that record the highest concentration of Glyphosate, according to a latest research conducted by a top university in the United States.
The Department of Biology of Moroksy College of Health Professions and Sciences in the United States has published a research paper on its findings.
According to the paper, Glyphosate is the most widely applied herbicide in the world to eliminate broadleaf weeds and grasses that compete with crops. The paper said the highest concentration was found in four specific sample sources. They are tea bag, tea leaves, coffee power and honey.
We observed elevated urinary glyphosate levels in participants who drank tea, the paper said. (Kelum Bandara)

Trump lashes out at publication of special counsel questions
	

By John Wagner,
President Trump lashed out Tuesday at the publication of questions that special counsel Robert S. Mueller III was said to be interested in asking him as part of the Russia probe and possible attempts to obstruct the inquiry. 
In a morning tweet, Trump said it was disgraceful that the 49 questions were provided to the New York Times, which published them Monday night. 
It appears that the leak did not come from Muellers office. The Times reported that the questions were relayed to Trumps attorneys as part of negotiations over the terms of a potential interview with the president. The list was then provided to the Times by a person outside Trumps legal team, the paper said. 
In his tweet, Trump also falsely asserts that there are no questions about Collusion. 
While the questions published by the Times are wide-ranging  and include more related to possible obstruction of justice  the list includes 13 related to possible co-operation between the Trump campaign and Russia. 
Among those is a query about Trumps knowledge of any outreach by his former campaign chairman Paul Manafort to Russia about potential assistance to the campaign. A court filing this month revealed that Mueller had sought authorization to expand his probe into allegations that Manafort committed a crime or crimes by colluding with Russian government officials. Another question asks about Trumps knowledge of a June 2016 meeting in Trump Tower between his aides and a Russian lawyer who offered politically damaging information on Trumps Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton.

White Water Rafting in Kitulgala Undergrads dreams shattered during Rafting expedition
	
A lot of safety instructions must be followed when indulging in White Water Rafting
During an emergency, hold on to the safety rope of the rafter and bend towards the inside of the raft, were the instructions given to us by the raftsman of the raft when we boarded it. Seven of us boarded this raft. As we proceeded and while moving through boulders the right side of the raft knocked against a boulder. As a result of the impact the raft overturned and Chanaka and Kanishka got caught in the gushing water and drifted away. 
As a result of the impact the raft overturned and Chanaka and Kanishka got caught in the rushing water
	Kanishka had been a student at the Engineering Faculty of Moratuwa University
	The raft in which Kanishka was travelling met with an unforeseen accident at the time the raft was moving on the gushing water.
This is how Thisara Kavinda explained what had happened at the river at the inquest held into the death of Kanishka Dilshan Weerakoon (23) who was drowned in the Kelani River at Kithulgala when he engaged in White Water Rafting. 
Kanishka had been a student at the Engineering Faculty of Moratuwa University. He had ventured on an expedition with a group comprising fellow students. This expedition was on the Kelani River. In other words they were going to indulge in White Water Rafting. 
Kanishka had left home on April 20th bidding farewell to his friends. His father had taken him by a tuk tuk to the pickup point where he was to meet his friends and then proceed on this exciting trip. Kanishka and his friends were all staying in the same boarding and were very close friends. On arriving at the Pettah Bus Stand they had all boarded a bus heading towards Nawalapitiya. Their destination however was Kithulgala, a tourist hotspot situated on the way to Nawalapitiya. There were thirteen of them. Arriving at the scenic spot they arranged with two raftmen to take them on the river journey. After putting on the safety jackets and helmets they were pooled into two groups. One raft was to carry six of them and the other seven. 
Kanishka Dilshan Weerakoon
The excitement mounted as two groups get onto the rafts and listened to the safety instructions. They were briefed about the ride and told how to act during an emergency. They listened impatiently and everyone seemed thrilled to have this novel experience. The raft in which Kanishka was travelling met with an unforeseen accident at the time the raft was moving on the gushing water. He was caught under the overturned boat and drowned. Performing artificial respiration was not possible as he had already died of asphyxia. 
Kanishka, a resident of Katuwellegama area, lived with his parents and only sister. He had had his initial education at Harischandra College Negombo. After excelling at the Year Five Scholarship Examination he had received an opportunity to continue his education at Gamapaha Bandaranaike College where he obtained 3 A passes at the Advanced Level Examination. He had received the third highest marks from the Gampaha District and qualified to enter Moratuwa University. Enjoyimg the benefits of the Mahapola Scholarship funds he soon became a leading student at the university. 
His father is a retired police officer while his mother is employed at the Watupitawela Hospital. 
The much anguished parents lament that Kanishkas dream of providing for the family after finding employment one day had been shattered.
