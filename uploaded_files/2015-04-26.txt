JHU supports 19A & 20A
	
The Jathika Hela Urumaya (JHU) which earlier opposed the 19th Amendment to the Constitution had decided to extend full support for the 19th and 20th Amendments to the Constitution, party General Secretary Patali Champika Ranawaka said today at a media briefing held in Battaramulla.
He said the current 19th Amendment that would amend the key powers vested with the Executive Presidency, was not the amendment presented to the Parliament on March 13.
He said the Amendment, where omissions for the sections required referendum, had been tabled according to the Supreme Court verdict.
?The 19th Amendment is an achievement of the JHU and 20th too, which aimed at electoral reforms. We extend our full support to the government to pass the amendments and it is a responsibility of all the political parties to vote for the amendments,? Ranawaka said.
He said some parties were expected to create chaos in Parliament by taking up issues about questioning Parliamentarians, when the 19th Amendment is taken up tommorrow (27). (Piyumi Fonseka)
