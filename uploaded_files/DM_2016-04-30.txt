Basil trying to split SLFP- Dayasiri
	
Former Economic Development Minister Basil Rajapaksa had been given a contract to divide the SLFP and weaken President Maithripala Sirisena allegedly funded by a neighbouring country, Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekera charged yesterday.asked whether it was a South Asian country, Minister Jayasekera did not deny it.
Minister Jayasekera said Mr. Rajapaksa, who deserted the SLFP and party supporters in the aftermath of the defeat at the Presidential election in January 2015, fled the country and returned to face an inquiry against him conducted by the FCID (Financial Crime Investigation Division). He is now on a contract to destroy the SLFP, on malice and vengeance. He is the prime mover of the rebel May Day really at Kirulapone organised by the so called Joint Opposition. He is going from district to district round the country distributing money given to him by a neighbouring country to woo SLFPERS to attend the Kirulapone rally. This money is dirty money, as it is being used for a dirty game, he charged.
Minister Jayasekera made an appeal to SLFPERS not to attend the Kirulapone rally, as it would definitely split the party, which would eventually be a big boost to the UNP and added those who love the SLFP would go to the main SLFP May Day rally in Galle and those who were scheming to destroy the party would attend the Kirulapone rally violating the party discipline and instructions.
He said it was extremely malicious, indecent and unethical to act against party leader President Sirisena as he was given the party leadership by former party leader and former President Mahinda Rajapaksa after his defeat at the Presidential poll.(Sandun A Jayasekera)

Phone charges to rise due to VAT
	
Phone call charges will increase because of the removal of the exemption of Value Added Tax (VAT) from the telecommunication services, Minister of Digital Technology Harin Fernando said yesterday.
Minister Fernando told a media briefing that call charges could go high as a result of the recent decision to remove the exemption VAT but concessionary packages including data packages and new technology will be introduced in the future so that the burden the people will have to bear will be reduced.
We will introduce concessionary data packages through which call charges could be reduced. One could browse internet using data service such as WhatsApp but the Government will see to it that more such modern technology will be available so that even call charges can be reduced as well, he said. He said the Google loon will help reduce the cost of telecommunication services as well, the Minister added.
Also, the Minister said plans are afoot to provide Smart phones to the recipients of EPF at a concessionary rate of Rs 500 and for the Samurdhi recipients at Rs 100.
Smart phones will be provided at a concessionary rate as lost cost new technology could be made use of only through such phones, he said.
The Government does not want to increase telecommunication charges but it is compelled to do so because of the current economic situation, Mr. Fernando added.
Meanwhile, the Minister threw a challenge at the joint opposition asking the organisers of that party to show a large crowd at its May Day rally in Kirulapone.
Joint Opposition will not be able to draw crowds despite the emergence of supermen such as former Minister Basil Rajapaksa, who is expected to participate in the rally, he said. (Yohan Perera)

Resolution not to divide country: CV
	
Northern Province Chief Minister C.V. Wignewaran said yesterday the recent resolution that was adopted to propose a federal system was not aimed at dividing the country but to unite it.
Mr. Wigneswaran said the country was not divided by the federal system and that federal system was a system in which everyone could get together and work.
The country is not divided by a Federal system as claimed by some people. Politicians have reiterated for years that a federal system leads to division of the country and the people have been forced to believe that. This system is being practised in several countries such as India, America, Canada and Switzerland, he said.
Mr. Wigneswaran said he submitted the resolution that was approved by all the councillors of the Northern Province to Speaker Karu Jayasuriya yesterday together with the opposition leader of the Northern Province.
You will see what our people s opinion was when the content of the resolution is revealed, he added.
He expressed these views after a discussion with Rural Economic Affairs Minister P. Harrison at the Estate Infrastructure and Community Development Ministry yesterday.
When asked if it was reasonable to demand an independent administration for the Northern Province, Mr. Wigneswaran said the resolution had been drafted so that all the provinces could get an independent administration and added that they had not demanded a separate administration.
The resolution had been drafted so that power could be devolved to every province. Why is it wrong for the Tamil people to get their things done in Tamil Tamil people should be allowed to do their things in Tamil while the Sinhalese are allowed to do their things in Sinhala. The ethnic problem was created after Sinhala language was made the official language in 1956. If a solution was needed to the problem Tamils and Sinhalese should be allowed to do their things in their own languages, he said.
