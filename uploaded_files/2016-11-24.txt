Agriculture Minister Duminda Dissanayake yesterday invited Chief Opposition Whip and Janatha Vimukthi? Peramuna (JVP) Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake to play an active role in developing the agricultural sector by becoming an advisor to his ministry.
?You spoke about reviving the agricultural sector, but you too failed in this endeavour during your tenure as the agriculture minister. However why don't you support us by accepting the post of advisor to my ministry," the minister asked the JVP leader.
Mr. Dissanayake response was not audible because his mike was not switched on at that time.
However, President Maithripala Sirisena who was in the chambers was seen to be smiling at whatever was said.
The JVP leader accused the agricultural unit at the President's office getting involved in the agricultural sector bypassing the agriculture ministry. The President walked into the chambers at the time Mr. Dissanayake was making the allegation but there was no response from the president. (Yohan Perera)

GMOA threatens TU action if demands ignored
	
Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) today warned it would resort to trade union action sometime next week if its demands with regard to the budget proposals were not addressed.
GMOA Secretary Navin De Zoysa said during a special central committee meeting held today, the executive committee was vested with powers to take a decision on any action it deemed necessary.
He said the 2017 budget presented by Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake was the most unfortunate budget presented in the country's history.
Dr. Zoysa said the proposals to abolish the pension scheme for the new recruits to the State sector, discouraging professionals from remaining in the country, violating fundamental health policies, taking initial steps to privatize the health service and exposing the domestic job market to foreigners would have a negative impact on the State sector and the country.
He said it was also proposed that the Ceylon Tobacco Company should contribute to the presidential fund in violation of the Tobacco Convention of the World Health Organization.
Dr. Zoysa said initial steps have been taken to privatize the health sector by proposing private surgeries, laboratory services in government hospitals and the issuance of a bill to the patients showing the cost of the service.
He said the GMOA had taken steps to bring this to the notice of the President and the authorities concerned. (Ajith Siriwardana)

IPPBA to launch countrywide strike from Dec. 1
	
The Inter-Provincial Private Bus Association (IPPBA) today warned it would launch a countrywide bus strike from December 1 if the government failed to rescind the proposal to impose a fine of Rs.25,000 for traffic offences.
IPPBA President Sarath Vijitha Kumara said yesterday the strike would continue for five days, if the President did not intervene in sorting out this matter.
Transport Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva had announced on Monday that the Government would impose this fine in respect of traffic offences including speeding, drunk driving and overtaking on the left. All-island Bus Operators Association President Stanley Fernando said the strike would be launched in collaboration with all bus associations including motorcycle associations and container associations in the 16 districts.
?The decisions were taken without considering the people and only concerned about the satisfying a few parties,? he said.
Private bus operators had earlier threatened to strike if the proposal to increase the minimum fine of Rs 2,500 was not removed.
?This is the first time such a decision was taken to increase fines for traffic offences through a budget proposal. The decision to impose a fixed amount of Rs.25,000 is unfair. Earlier the Transport Minister had not interfered in such matters but this time the decision was taken by the minister himself," Mr. Fernando said.
He said the minister was not concerned about the people or their incomes.
?Unlike ministers, poor drivers don?t have that much of income to maintain a family. The only person who supports such a large fine is the Lanka Private Bus Owners' Association, President Gemunu Wijeratne,? Mr. Fernando said. ?The government should take the blame of the inconvenience caused to people. The laws applicable to the people should be applicable to MPs. They never adhere to road rules nor is any legal action taken against them." (Chaturanga Pradeep)

LB Finance September net profit up 20% on higher lending growth
	
LB Finance PLC, Sri Lanka?s third largest non-bank finance company by assets, increased its net profit for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 (2Q17) by 20 percent to Rs.948.1 billion or Rs.6.84 a share from a year ago supported by relatively strong growth in loans and leases amid toughened lending conditions.?
The company loans and leases amounted to Rs.7.5 billion during the six months to September 30, but the deposits had a negative growth. LB Finance?s lending growth during the six months was on par or in some cases above the total lending growth recorded during a nine months period by some of the small and mid-sized banks. ?
L B Finance, which generally maintains a double-digit interest margin, may have seen some pressure on its margins as the interest costs rose by a faster rate than income from interest.?
The net interest income rose by 17 percent to Rs.2.42 billion as the interest income rose by 25 percent Year-on-Year (YoY) to Rs.4.3 billion, while the interest expense grew by a faster 36 percent YoY to Rs.1.89 billion. ?
The company managed to maintain relatively higher margins due to its high yielding products such as microfinance, two-wheeler and three-wheeler leasing and gold-backed lending.?
The company maintains return on equity of 34.43 percent and return on assets of 4.3 percent ? extremely high but slightly down from the beginning of the financial year.?
Nevertheless, the performance could be adversely impacted during the remainder of the year as the budget proposed to contain credit flows into vehicles, particularly two-wheelers and three-wheelers, as the Loan-To-Value (LTV) ratio was brought down to just 25 percent from 70 percent. However, it is uncertain from when the proposal will become law as the Central Bank has to issue directives to that effect.?
Meanwhile, the higher risk appetite could also pose challenges for the company as it has a higher exposure to the microfinancing sector and pawning ? the sectors that are susceptible to economic soundness and disposable incomes ?which could be further deteriorated by the higher indirect taxes imposed recently.?
While the asset quality matrices were not published in the interim financial accounts, the company in a statement said provisions made for possible bad loans had seen a significant reduction of 95 percent to Rs.15 million from a year ago.?
As of September 30, LB Finance had an asset base of Rs.90 billion.?
The company had to fund its lending growth purely through borrowings as the deposits had a negative growth. It is not clear whether the company would go ahead with its plans to raise Rs. 5.0 billion through a debenture issue, as the 2017 budget proposed to lift the income tax exemption hitherto available on interest on corporate debt. Such a measure could dilute the investor appeal to invest in corporate debt.?
Meanwhile, for the six months ended September 30, 2016, the company made a net profit of Rs.1.86 billion or Rs.13. 43 a share, an increase of 19 percent from a year ago.?
The net interest income rose by 15 percent YoY to Rs. 4.75 billion and the net fee and commission income grew by 4 percent YoY to Rs. 568.6 million.
The investment vehicle of Dhammika Perera, Vallibel One PLC, together with Royal Ceramics Lanka PLC held 77.83 percent stake in LB Finance PLC.?

Mahapola Fund misuse-Malik rejects JO allegations
	
Development Strategies and International Trade Minister Malik Samarawickrama, yesterday, categorically rejected the allegation by the Joint Opposition (JO) that he had misused funds belonging to the Mahapola Fund.
He said there was no truth whatsoever in the allegation and that the attempt by the Joint Opposition showed the bankruptcy of its members.
Mr. Samarawickrama said he was only a member of the Mahapola Trust Fund. He said the Chief Justice was its head and its decision maker.
?If any decision is made with regard to the Fund, it has to go through the Chief Justice. Nothing of the sort that the JO has alleged had been done. No funds have been misused or abused. These baseless allegations only show that the JO members are from the gutters,? he told Daily Mirror.
Meanwhile, Dr. Wickrema Weerasooria, the chairman of National Wealth Corporation Ltd (NWCL), also rejected the allegations levelled by the Joint Opposition.
Speaking to Daily Mirror, Dr. Weerasooria said what the JO said was a diabolical lie.
?Mahapola funds have never been used by the said two companies, and no Mahapola fund had been misused or abused. Gihan Jayatilleke, the Chief Executive Officer of NWCL could corroborate this,? he said.
He said the allegations were attempts by the JO to embarrass Minister Malik Samarawickrama and himself. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

More want medical reports to get driving licences: NTMI Chairman
	
National Transport Medical Institute (NTMI) Chairman Rohana Pushpakumara said yesterday that there had been a drastic increase in the number of persons reporting to the institute to obtain the medical reports required for driving licences during the last few days.
He said that earlier only about 350 people a day arrived at the Nugegoda Head Office to obtain medical reports, whereas, now, about 700 people were arriving at the institute every day.
Mr.? Pushpakumara said the number of people arriving at the other 25 regional centres, including Kandy, Gampaha and Werahera, had also doubled.
He said this may be due to several reasons, such as rumours that the licence fees would be increased and the minimum age of three-wheeler drivers would be increased to 25.
He said another probable reason was that most people who had driven without valid licences earlier had decided to obtain licences due to the Budget proposal to increase the penalty for driving without a valid licence to Rs. 25,000. He said this was a good trend.
He said they were making every effort to cater to the needs of the people seeking their service. (Bimal Shyaman)

No subsidy or welfare facility slashed: Ravi
	
Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake said today no subsidy or other welfare facility that were increased for the people after this government came in to power was slashed or removed.
A statement issued by the Ministry said despite huge allocations made for development projects in the Budget 2017, Rs.403 billion had been allocated for subsidies and welfare expenditures, which was an increase of Rs.143 billion when compared with Rs.260 billion allocated in 2014.
?After Finance Minister presented Budget 2017 in Parliament on November 10, the Finance Ministry has observed that certain politicians who partake in post-budget discussions and debates on audio and visual media and at the Press Conferences make baseless allegations to portray that the current government has cut back the public subsidies and welfare payments,? the statement added.
?None of the allocations already made available for subsidies on fertilizer, Samurdhi and school uniforms have been reduced. In-fact the payment for school uniforms are now being distributed to students at schools without any haphazard. The replacement of giving fertilizer at subsidized price and school uniforms to students with cash payment has not only brought the advantage of bringing down the use of chemical fertilizer but also streamlined the process with efficiency eliminating the middlemen? whereby reducing the cost incurred on? fertilizer and school uniforms,? it said.
The statement said the special interest rate? paid for the first Rs.1.5 million fixed deposit by senior citizens and? Rs.2000 monthly payment for needy senior citizens introduced in 2015 after this government came in to power had not been reduced or removed as certain opposition politicians try to mislead the people.
?This government, for the first time in history, started to pay a higher interest rate for the deposits on senior citizens? saving accounts in 2015. Rs.1, 450million and Rs.4000 million were allocated for this purpose by Budget 2015 and Budget 2016 respectively. It has been reported that expecting higher dividends, more and more retired senior citizens have deposited their pension funds in commercial banks. Therefore, in order to meet this increased demand to pay the higher interest rate to senior citizens the treasury of the Finance Ministry has allocated Rs.8000 million for 2017. In the meantime the Rs.20, 000 being paid for expectant mothers for a POSHANA MALLA over a period of 10 months is also being distributed without any curtailment?
?The present government of good governance, as it pledged, increased the Samurdhi allowance in 2015. Allocation made to pay Samurdhi allowance in 2014 was Rs.15 billion and, it has been increased up to Rs.44 billion in 2017. The minimum Samurdhi allowance paid in 2014 was minimum of? Rs.210 and the? maximum was Rs.1, 500. It has now been increased to a minimum payment of Rs.420 and a maximum payment of Rs.3, 500.
?Since the President has declared 2017 as the year of poverty eradication, the fertilizer subsidy that has been granted for paddy has been extended to cover tea, rubber and coconut from next year in order to uplift the agricultural economy. Additional Rs.1, 500 million has been allocated for this purpose in the Budget 2017. At the same time, a new subsidy scheme has been introduced from 2017, with the allocation of another Rs.450 million to give subsidy for domestic milk powder manufacturers as part of making the country self sufficient in milk?
Meanwhile, the Finance Ministry has established a Welfare Beneficiary Board to ensure that the subsidies and welfare payments are being given to the needy and actual beneficiaries without being duplicated. This particular monetary board has been preparing a data base incorporating the particulars of the beneficiaries of all kind of subsidies welfare payments.

SL fined for slow over-rate against WI
	
Sri Lanka has been fined for maintaining a slow over-rate against the West Indies in the fifth match of the tri-nation series in Bulawayo on Wednesday, the ICC announced today.
Javagal Srinath of the Elite Panel of ICC Match Referees imposed the fine after Upul Tharanga?s side was ruled to be two overs short of its target when time allowances were taken into consideration.
?
In accordance with Article 2.5.1 of the ICC Code of Conduct for Players and Player Support Personnel, which relates to minor over-rate offences, players are fined 10 per cent of their match fees for every over their side fails to bowl in the allotted time, with the captain fined double that amount.
?
As such, Tharanga has been fined 40 per cent of his match fee, while his players have received 20 per cent fines. If Sri Lanka commits another minor over-rate breach in an ODI within 12 months of this offence with Tharanga as captain, it will be deemed a second offence by Tharanga and he will face a suspension.
?
Tharanga pleaded guilty to the offence and accepted the proposed sanction, so there was no need for a formal hearing.
The charge was laid by on-field umpires Richard Illingworth and Jeremiah Matibiri, third umpire Michael Gough and fourth official Langton Rusere.

Some elements engaged in anti-Muslim campaigns: ACJU
	
All Ceylon Jamiyyathul Ulama (ACJU) said today some elements were actively engaged in continuous anti-Muslim campaigns which would induce racism and disrupt the prevailing peace and coexistence.
?Such activities targeted towards a community, would disrupt the prevailing peace and coexistence and affect the development process of the country and also would violate the Rights assured by the Constitution to every citizen of this Country,? ACJU said in a statement.
ACJU Propaganda Committee Secretary Ash-Sheikh H. Omardeen said that the Muslims living in this country had been continuously facing a number of challenges throughout history.
?We have overcome such periods successfully by being calm and patient as per the teachings of Islam. We Muslims should refrain and protect ourselves from major Sins and make sincere efforts towards strengthening the bond with Allah. Certainly, our good deeds would result in peace and prosperity to the Muslims and all others,? he said.
He also said the current situation prevailing in the country had resulted in restlessness among the Muslim Community.
Mr. Omardeen said Muslim organizations decided to meet the President, Prime Minister, Muslim Parliamentarians and the concerned Officers to discuss on the appropriate actions to smoothen the situation.
He said a committee was appointed to continue the efforts in building better relations and coexistence with other communities.

Stunning images
	
At first glance, it looks like a cloak of stars hanging over a rugged mountain range.
But look closer and you'll notice some distortion around its tree-lined base. But what could that be?
Filmmaker Kevin Wolf, based in San Francisco, captured the image at California's Yosemite National Park on a clear day.
He noticed that the glimmering sand and pebbles in a lake somewhat resembled stars - and when he flipped the picture he was proved absolutely correct.
So he shared it on Reddit, where it quickly started trending.
'I flipped this photo upside down because the sand under the river kinda looked like stars', he explained.
The water is so glassy clear that the mountains are perfectly reflected, lending the upside down image an even more realistic nature.
Only the faint ripples in the centre of the photo give it away.
'Spectacular! Almost like looking at a shot of night and day!' one admirer wrote.
'Best "star" photo of Yosemite yet!' another remarked.
The Yosemite National Park, nestled in California?s Sierra Nevada mountains, attracts millions of visitors every year - beloved for its breathtaking natural scenery.
Declared a World Heritage Site in 1984, it covers more than 740,000 acres and 95 per cent of it is designated wilderness. (Daily Mail)

## Title: Sugathadasa track tender fixed?

Sugathadasa track tender fixed?
	
The Sports Ministry has allegedly tailored the specifications of a tender to re-lay the 400 metre and 200 metre training tracks at the Sugathadasa Sports Complex in order to award the project to a pre-selected company.
The works include repairs and improvement to other features related to the synthetic tracks. It is being claimed that the bidding criteria have been designed to facilitate a favoured company and that no other contractor can compete on those terms.
Now, interested companies have written to the Sports Ministry to make the process more transparent for the benefit of the country.
The bid document required the fulfillment of strict conditions to qualify, including prior experiencing in laying at least one Class I track and five Class II tracks in South Asia. Critics argue that these have been introduced based on the experience of the ?favoured? bidder.
?Synthetic Track Manufacture/Installer with experience in installing minimum of Ten (10) IAAF Class 1 tracks including at least one (1) in South Asia and minimum of Ten (10) IAAF Class II Synthetic athletics tracks including at least five (5) in South Asia,? Section II Clause 3.5 (a) states.
According to the above criteria, only Conica Sports Flooring - a company which laid the Synthetic Track at the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium ahead of the 2010 Commonwealth Games and 12 other Class II tracks in India - meets the pre-requisites.
?Given the bid specifications, it?s clear that they have rigged it even before calling for bids. There?s only one company that qualify under these criteria,? said a bidder. ?In that case, why they waste our money and time??
?We have no issue who gets it as long as they follow the correct procedure and select the best available bid,? another said. ?But they didn?t even evaluate the proposals of those qualify under major deviations.?
?They have laid down tough criteria for the foreign company to meet but had lowered the qualifying criteria for the local company which actually placed the bid,? he said. It?s very clear that this has been manipulated, and is also against the National Procurement Guidelines.?
Six companies?Access Engineering PLC, Sierra Construction Ltd, CML-MTD Construction Ltd, RR Construction, Fentons Ltd and Konelu Construction - submitted technical and price proposals (design and build) but Fentons, RR and Konelu had not met the major deviations and were disqualified.
Section 2 (f) states that the ?bidders with CIDA (Construction Industry Development Agency (Formerly ICTAD) registration Grade 3 or above for highway construction with joint venture with Synthetic Manufacture or his Authorised Agent can participate in the tender?. This has been done to fit in the pre-selected bidder, industry sources argue.
Meanwhile, Central Engineering Consultancy Bureau (CECB) had sent out letters requesting for quotations from international suppliers. The Daily Mirror is in possession of a copy.
?If this is an open tender, why do they want price quotations before calling for tenders?? questioned an authoritative source. ?This shows that they were planning to rig it from the start.?
Writing to the Secretary of the Ministry of Sports, one bidder cites that there?s a strong possibility some manufacturers may use low quality Asian-sourced raw materials for the project instead of US or European raw materials. ?
?If this particular practice played a part in the early demise of the previous track at the Sugathadasa, then we would agree that this approach should be avoided at all costs,? the letter written by one of the bidders stated.
?We kindly solicit your intervention in this matter and that necessary measures be taken to arrest the situation so that justice and equality be given to other bidders.?
Sugathadasa track, which is currently in a dilapidated state, was laid in 2012 ahead of the Asian Junior Athletics Championships in Colombo at a cost of Rs. 113 million.
However, the track showed signs of physical damage less than 12 months into completion as low quality raw materials had been used by the contractor.
?There?s a strong possibility that we might have a failed track once again,? another source said. ?This is the only track we have and we should make sure to get the best product on offer in order to facilitate the careers of our athletes. But sadly it?s not happening again and they have forgotten that shortcuts have serious consequences.?
In October 2014, a company offered to re-lay the 400m track at a discounted price of US $285,200 (approximately Rs. 42m at current exchange rate) but authorities did not proceed due to reasons best known to them. (Champika Fernando)
