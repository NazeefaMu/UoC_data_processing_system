Are state banks performing their national duty, asks President
	
President Maithripala Sirisena expressed reservations yesterday over the huge profits recorded annually by state banks established to serve the local industries, the agriculture sector and save the rural people from loan sharks.
He questioned whether the state banks served the purported objectives laid down when they were established by collecting 100% profits or more annually.
Delivering the keynote address at the launching of the Entrepreneurs Paradise Loan Scheme  Enterprise Sri Lanka under the Gamperaliya Rural Development Project at the BMICH last afternoon, President Sirisena went onto say that time was right to carry out a survey to determine the contribution that had been made by state owned commercial banks to expand and develop the rural economy and domestic industries.
One may ask whether the huge profits collected by the state banks go to cover government expenditure or to the people. My opinion is that 50% of profits must be allocated as state revenue and normal banking services and the remaining 50% must set aside to facilitate the local industries. It is understandable if and when private commercial banks provide their services solely on profits. But a state bank has a national duty to perform by helping the local industry, increase exports and help generating employment because state banks have been established to achieve those noble objectives. We in many instances in the past have discussed about the huge profits make by state banks, President Sirisena stressed.
President Sirisena said the assistance that must come from state banks to bring down unemployment, motivate local entrepreneurs, improve exports and develop the rural industry are being discussed widely in many a forum and among banks themselves, intellectuals and bankers. In those discussions, it has been revealed that there were about 100 loan schemes to help local entrepreneurs. It was also mentioned in those interactions that the knowledge among the people on banking services and products were low.
"That is why the Finance Ministry and Public Enterprise and Kandy City Development Ministry has launched this highly ambitious joint programme, Entrepreneurs Paradise Lon Scheme  Enterprise Sri Lanka. This programme has introduced 15 loan schemes selected from among 100 loan schemes, President Sirisena stressed. (Sandun A Jayasekera)

Demarcated areas outside Knuckles boundary: Ministry
	
The Public Enterprise and Kandy City Development Ministry yesterday said the report of the team of auditors sent to the Knuckles Mountain Range had revealed that the lands demarcated for the proposed-projects were outside the rock boundary of the mountain range.
Ministry Secretary Ravindra Hewavitharana told the Daily Mirror that they had sent a team of auditors last week to inquire into the alleged transfer of 21,000 acres of land in the Knuckles Mountain Range to close associates of government ministers.
He said the report had also revealed that there had been nothing proposed to establish within the Knuckles Mountain Range as per the auditors findings followed by several investigations.
The auditors were accompanied by officials of the Department of Forest Conservation, Grama Niladharis, Superintendents and officials of the related companies and residents of the area. The team has reached the site with the coordination of Global Positioning System (GPS), he said.
The eco-tourist project which is proposed to be established in this area is outside the rock boundary of the mountain range. We will make more considerations since it is a high environmentally sensitive area, he added.
He said the report of the team of auditors would be sent to Minister Lakshman Kiriella in the coming days.
Earlier, the Movement for Land and Agriculture Reform (MONLAR) claimed that these lands which were managed by State Plantations Corporation and Elkaduwa Plantation Limited had been given to close associates and relatives of two powerful ministers. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)

Gam Udawa: Brainchild of a revered statesman
	
President Premadasa at the inauguration of Gam Udawa in 1985

Grew in might and expanded every year
Cultural traditions given pride of place
Discipline and decorum upheld
Last exhibition held in 1992 at Buttala 
Management team a tight-knit, high-calibre structure

The twenty-third of June is remembered and commemorated as it is the birth anniversary of the great visionary leader, Ranasinghe Premadasa, who kindled the hopes and aspirations of the people of this country, especially of the poor and the downtrodden.
But to us, veterans in the Housing Ministry, it is more than just his birth anniversary. It was the opening day of the annual Gam Udawa exhibition. The exhibition which commenced in Ampara on a modest scale, grew and expanded over the years to become not only the major showcase of the governments development efforts, but also the major annual attraction for the people across the country, especially the rural folks who were rather starved of leisure and entertainment. It became the event to look forward to, and the people flocked in thousands to the exhibition. Its grandeur and exhilaration persisted from the end of one to the beginning of the next. For the few of us involved in its planning, operation, detail and glamour, it was an unparalleled experience marked with vision, innovation, precision and delegation.
Gam Udawa grew in its might and variety and expanded every year. During its celebrated history, it went on adding novel features and exploring ways of reaching the masses. It achieved prestige to an extent that participation in the exhibition was considered a signal honour amongst public servants and those from the private sector. Public institutions as well as private sector firms vied one another to get a better exposure for their stalls. It attracted all kinds of artistes  musicians, dancers, dramatists, painters and poets. It displayed exquisite taste in arts, music and dancing, and a thorough understanding of our culture. Renowned artistes like Amaradeva, Jothipala, Mohideen Baig and Latha adorned the stage. The rural population was provided with the opportunity to witness stage dramas like Maname. The exhibition even attracted a puppeteer to hold daily performances. It never degenerated into a gaudy or noisy Bajawwa. It never attracted hooligans or thugs. The cultural traditions of the country were always given the pride of place. One of its noteworthy achievements was its discipline and decorum. During the almost one-and-a-half decades of the exhibition, there have never been fights, scuffles or drunken disorderliness; neither have there been thefts, harassments or other infringements of the law. Cleanliness and orderliness were given prominence. Gam Udawa may have achieved such a state of discipline because the movement was based on the principle, the Premadasa vision, of trusting people, or it may have been due to the extra vigilance paid by the police and law enforcement officers, with the President gracing the exhibition almost every day.

During the almost one-and-a-half decades of the exhibition, there have never been fights, scuffles or drunken disorderliness; neither have there been thefts, harassments or other infringements of the law

I believe the last exhibition, Gam Udawa 1992, held at Buttala in the Moneragala District, was the best and most extensive of its kind. I myself was fortunate to be a member of its core management team as the director responsible for harnessing private sector participation. For me, it was the most challenging yet most enjoyable managerial experience ever.
Over the years, the Gam Udawa core management team evolved as a very tight-knit, high-calibre structure. Its planning and management came under the personal guidance and monitoring of President Premadasa and the direction and co-coordination of the then Housing and Construction Minister Sirisena Cooray. The affable, dependable and resourceful Mr. Cooray provided political leadership and direction that the exhibition management depended and trusted upon. He always stood as the buffer between the occasional wrath and impatience of the President and us, the ground workers, who managed various aspects of the exhibition under great stress.
The planning and management of the exhibition was structured around a carefully-established system of committees. Each committee had been assigned precise tasks and clear lines of delegation. At the apex of the management structure was the Gam Udawa Main Committee chaired by the then Secretary to the Ministry, Mr. Ailapperuma. He was also the Director General of the exhibition, with Siri Hattotuwegama, the then Secretary to the Presidents Fund as his erstwhile deputy. Mr. Ailapperuma and Mr. Hattotuwegama formed the pivot around which the whole management structure turned: only they were fully-conversant with the total picture of the exhibition. Each committee under its own acknowledged leadership had their own precise tasks, and I recollect that there were about fifteen committees reporting to the Main Committee. The two most important committees with the heaviest responsibilities were the exhibition ground committee chaired by Dr. Michael Joachim, the then Additional Secretary to the Ministry and the District Integrated Development Committee chaired by Conrad de Tissera, the other Additional Secretary. Other committees included the Janahamuwa Committee chaired at first by Bimal Padmaperuma in his role as Chairman of the State Engineering Corporation, the Construction Committee chaired by Y.M.I. Bandara, Director of Buildings, the Housing and Model Villages Development Committee chaired by Susil Siriwardana, the Media and Publicity Committee chaired by Lakvijaye Palansuriya, the Processions Committee chaired by T. Mahalingam, the Religious Affairs Committee chaired by K.M. Abeysinghe and the Security Committee chaired by A.C. Lawrence, a retired DIG who was the Security Advisor to the Ministry. As the Chairman of the Private Sector Stalls Committee, my task proved to be quite easy as the private sector was clamouring to participate, but I had to settle their claims for what they perceived to be better turf on the exhibition ground. The private sector was also much concerned and fuzzy about their facilities, entry passes, servicing their stalls and so forth, and it was my committees responsibility to attend to their requirements. But my committee turned out to be one of the greatest contributors to the income of the exhibition.
The exhibition management structure proved to be solid, united and dynamic and worked with a singleness of purpose. I do not remember even a minor failure in the complex spectrum of activities during the period in which I served as a Committee Chairman and a director of the exhibition grounds. There were well-tried and well-documented procedures for reporting, monitoring, servicing and for occasional fire-fighting. They never failed. I remember Mr. Ailapperuma issuing what was titled as Orders of the Day at midnight. These orders which included each and every activity in minute detail for the following day were distributed to all key officials. I recollect that the Presidents security detail waited to collect these orders and take them wherever the President was physically present the following day. The programme, as issued, was strictly adhered to and could not be changed other than by the Director General or his deputy. It was bureaucratic machinery par excellence.
The Gam Udawa annual programme was not a lone effort by the Housing Ministry, but a national programme supported by the government. We received steady and ungrudging support from the powerful and respected R. Paskaralingam, Head of the Treasury, who ensured resources were made available to the implementing agencies in the integrated District Development Programme. M.B.S. Fernando, Chairman of the Road Development Authority, was a tower of strength. He did up all the roads in the district and within the exhibition grounds. Charitha Ratwatte, Head of the Youth Affairs Ministry, extended total support of the NYSC to the exhibition. It was a treat to watch the glamorously-dressed NYSC bands parading the exhibition grounds at regular intervals. M. Marasinghe Perera, the then Colombo Municipal Commissioner, performed the unenviable task of keeping the grounds and its environs spotlessly clean. There were many others like Jehan Cassim, the then Chairman of Bank of Ceylon, Sunil Jayaweera, the then Director of Sports in the Education Ministry, M.A.G. Perera, the then Chairman of the Electricity Board, Peter Perera, Head of the Insurance Corporation, who were closely associated with the exhibition and spent long hours with us in its operation.
The exhibition also brought out many innate and hidden talents amongst its vast numbers of workers at all levels, both from the public and private sectors. They often proved most innovative and creative. I remember the enterprising officials of the Agricultural Department, who under the personal direction of their minister, Dharmadasa Banda, successfully installed a paddy field and a vegetable garden, ready for harvesting during the exhibition period. They committed one whole year on this task and ultimately won the prize for the best stall. There was G.M.H. Wijedasa, we called him Duwana Wije, then a director in the Environmental Authority, who was assigned the task of Stores Manager. He, with the assistance of his daughter, digitized the whole stores management, and could produce any requirement, from a doormat to bedroom or office furniture at very short notice. One ever-present, non-complaining figure was Sarath Jayatillake, the Working Director of SEC, who was the sole custodian of the stage, its lights, sounds and the decor. Mr. Sarath, and his able assistant, Milinda Gunawardena were also in charge of the daily flag-hoisting ceremony, which they performed with great finesse. There was Shelton Fernando of the Town and Country Planning Department, who tended to landscaping of the Gam Udawa site, ensuring that the flowers bloomed and the fountains danced during the exhibition period. One charismatic figure was T. Mahalingam, the then Chairman of the Common Amenities Board, the organiser of processions and pageants. I recollect him leading the pageant every day, in his white suit and white cap, riding a white roadster. There was Bimal Padmaperuma, Chairman of SEC, a silent and a resourceful worker, who was tasked with the construction of a Chaithya at each site, which proved to be a quite complicated task and a heavy responsibility. He was also the organiser of the annual Gam Udawa cycle race. Erananda Hettiarachci, the current Director General of SLBC was the ever present liaison with the TV and the media. He was also the compere at all principal events, especially at which the President was present. Lakvijaa Palansriya, the present Chairman of NHDA was responsible for media coverage and produced quite colourful souvenirs and invitation cards. Mr. Madugalle, Chairman of the Water Board, was our elder statesman. He ensured the supply of drinking water and coordinated other infrastructure facilities, and was an ever-present figure in the Secretariat, always dependable to handle an emergency in the absence of the Director General or his deputy. A quite fascinating personality was B. Danwatta, the then Chief Accountant of the Ministry, who was Chairman of the Committee on Accommodation. Gam Udawa required vast amounts of temporary accommodation at all levels and Mr. Danwatte had a stressful job. His peculiarity was that he always carried his accommodation register under his arm and tolerated no interference even from the high and the mighty. There was Kodi Dissanayake, the then Chief Clerk in the Ministry, who was entrusted with the peculiar task of ensuring that all the flags, not only on the site but anywhere in the district, were flying and flagpoles were not slanting. He and his team had a 24-hour job. From the private sector came many innovative individuals: Jayasiri Semage who created classic artworks and pandals and Wimaladasa of Renuka Electricals who created beautiful and colourful designs with his lights and illuminations. Mr. Wijesekara of Parakrama Radio was quite innovative with the public address system and his tasteful and sober selection of music to be broadcast. There were many others, recounting about whom will take many more pages. The crux of the success was that they all formed a great team, bound, as I mentioned earlier, in a singleness of purpose. Minister Sirisena Cooray and Ministry Secretary Ailapperuma, extremely patient, resourceful and unflappable, were able to identify capabilities, assign responsibilities correctly and eke out the best out of everybody. They always stood by us, the foot-workers.
Much more can be related of that exhilarating experience of planning, organising and managing the annual exhibition. But I conclude by paying a tribute to those Gam Udawa greats who are no longer with us: Michael Joachim, Siri Hattotuwegama, T. Mahalingam, Bimal Padmaperuma, Marasinghe Perera, N.D. Peiris, D. Peter, S. Perera, Electrical Engineer Gurusinghe, Site Engineer Hemasiri and Mr. Wimaladasa of Renuka Electricals amongst them. May they attain Nibbana.

His life was an inspiration to others
	
Mahinda Bandusena, a senior and very distinguished public servant passed away recently after a fairly prolonged period of ill-health. What is note-worthy about the formative period of his career covering school and university, is the total reliance on the free education system and the enabling environment that it ushered.
A quintessentially village lad, with practically no social props he availed himself with a vengeance of the opportunities the free education system offered. He applied himself with extra-ordinary determination, short circuiting the school calendar through double promotions and commenced his university career at Peradeniya at a very young age. It is a tribute alike to his determination and innate abilities that he secured a place, through a highly competitive examination in the coveted Administrative Service.

he slowly but steadily advanced towards the summit of the service, serving as an Additional Secretary Defence, Secretary Industries and Secretary Public Adminstration.

Thereafter he slowly but steadily advanced towards the summit of the service, serving as an Additional Secretary Defence, Secretary Industries and Secretary Public Adminstration. He performed with such acceptance in this position that his minister, Mr. Rathnasiri Wickremanayake, on becoming prime minister sought his services as secretary to the Prime Minister. His career in the public service was crowned with the position of Ambassador to Israel. In every one of these positions he gave of his best. The somewhat conducive political and administrative atmosphere that prevailed during this time enabled him to do what is expected of an administrator keeping political and other vultures at bay.

Although so thoroughly immersed in the public service at such heights, he remained essentially a family man, ensuring that his two daughters and son ended up as medical and engineering professionals. He was singularly fortunate in the two sons-in-law and the daughter-in-law that joined his family.  His wife Lalitha, the three children and grand children sustained him especially during his unfortunate illness. The loving care with which his wife nursed him, administering myriad medications meticulously, at frequent intervals will stand out as a shining example of wifely devotion and love.  It is to be hoped that his life as an administrator and family man will be an inspiration to others. May he attain the supreme Bliss of Nirvana.

How a bishop is appointed and the services he has to perform
	

The Catholic Church in Sri Lanka celebrates the ordination of a new Auxiliary Bishop of Colombo Rt. Rev. Jayakody Aratchige Don Anton Jayakodytoday, June23 at St. Lucias Cathedral, Colombo. 
Rev. Fr Edmund Tilakaratne, Director Social Communication Centre of Archdiocese of Colombo, spoke to on the event and outlined the history of the Catholic Church in Sri Lanka. He also explained in length how a bishop is appointed and the functions a bishop has to perform. 

How a Bishop is appointed and his main functions
As Fr. Tilakaratne explained priests are asked to write about whom they think should be appointed as a bishop. They are asked to write secretly. The next step would be to select the top three whom priests have named and written about. The names of the selected three are then handed over to the Apostolic Nuncio (Ambassador of the Vatican). The three names are then sent to Rome for the Vatican to consider. Many discussions and consultations take place at this stage. The Cardinal if available or the Archbishop of an archdiocese in the said area is consulted in the case of appointing an auxiliary bishop. In the case of appointing a bishop the outgoing bishop is consulted if necessary. Elders of the church in Rome then select a priest whom they think is best suited for the job naming him number one. The remaining two are named number two and three.

Bishop Jayakody will fill the vacancy created by the resignation of Bishop Marius. Bishop Emmanuel Fernando was catering to the needs of the Tamil flock in the archdiocese


All three names are then handed over to the Pope who makes the final decision. According to Fr. Tilakaratne the Pope has the final say. He could name the priest chosen for the number one spot or even appoint priests who have been chosen as number 2 or three as the Bishop or the auxiliary. 
Usually auxiliaries are appointed to an archdiocese. An area is declared as an archdiocese if there is a high population of Catholics. Sometimes the geographical extent is also considered. Colombo is the only archdiocese in Sri Lanka. About 50 percent of Sri Lankas Catholics live in Colombo. There are several archdioceses inbigger countries. 
Bishops are usually considered a position with fullness of priesthood, Fr Tilakaratne said. However this does not mean that priests are half baked. Bishops have specific functions while priests help the bishops in carrying out their functions. A bishop has the power to ordain a priest or a deacon. They have the power to give specific sacraments which are considered divine gifts, such as confirmation. 
An Auxiliary Bishop helps a bishop to carry out his work in an archdiocese. 
One can also say that a bishop has three main functions to perform. These include shepherding the flock, sanctifying (making the flock holy) and governing the church. 

About the auxiliary bishop elect
Bishop-Elect Rt. Rev. Anton Jayakody was born on October 2, 1958 in Pamunugma in the Archdiocese of Colombo. He entered the St Aloysius minor seminary in 1975 after completing his studies at St. Josephs Roman Catholic School and at Gonsalves College. 
Fr Jayakody entered the National Seminary, Ampitiya, Kandy in 1978 where he studied philosophy and theology. He was ordained a priest in Colombo on July 27, 1985. He was a member of the staff of the Intermediate Seminary, Kalutara, and served as a Parish Priest of Wewala, Pannipitiya, Halpe, and Welivita. He obtained his Licenciate in Philosophy at the Pontifical Urbaniana
University in Rome. 
He held the post of Bursar and Formator at the National Seminary, Kandy. He was also Director Philosophate at the National Seminary, Kandy, and thereafter appointed as the Rector of Ampitiya National Seminary, from 20052011. From 2011 to date, he has been the Episcopal Vicar for Priestly Formation and Promotion of Vocations of the Archdiocese of Colombo, while being the Rector of St. John Mary Vianney Major Seminary, Colombo. 

There were a few Franciscans including a parish priest by the name of Joo Vaz Monteiroin Colombo.

Future of the Colombo Archdiocese
Colombo archdiocese is headed by Archbishop Malcolm Cardinal Ranjith. There were three auxiliaries in the archdiocese during recent times. They were Rt. Rev Marius Peiris, Rt. Rev. Emmanuel Fernando and Rt. Rev. Maxwell Silva. Bishop Marius according to Fr. Tilakaratne resigned recently due to ill health. Bishop Jayakody will fill the vacancy created by the resignation of Bishop Marius. Bishop Emmanuel Fernando was catering to the needs of the Tamil flock in the archdiocese. However he was appointed as the Bishop of Mannar recently. Therefore Colombo Archdiocese might get another auxiliary in the future. 

History of Catholism in SL, Colombo archdiocese and its Bishops 
There is evidence that traders from Persia and South India brought Christianity to Sri Lanka prior to the 16th century. The Persian cross excavated in Anuradhapura belonging to the 5th century and the decorative baptismal pond excavated near Vavuniya proves the presence of Christians in Sri Lanka during the early period of the Anuradhapura Kingdom. A cross excavated from Anuradhapura in 1913 has been reportedly identical to the cross found at St Thomas Mount near Chennai. However Christianity has spread on a large scale during the time of the Portuguese who accidently arrived in Sri Lanka on November 15, 1505. 
Sri Lanka had a Tamil kingdom in the north and in the south there were two Sinhalese kingdoms, one in the central highlands with Kandy as its capital, and the other, comprising mainly of the south-western lowlands, at the time Portuguese arrived in the island according to the Mahawansa. The South Western region was the largest, richest and most powerful. The ruler of this region, King Dharma Parakramabahu IX was considered as the ruler of the whole country and resided in his capital, Kotte. Portuguese with the permission of King Dharma Parakramabahu IX built a small chapel in Colombo. Franciscan Friar Vicente, the chaplain of the fleet, celebrated Mass in that chapel. With the Portuguese influence in Kotte becoming stronger with time, the religion slowly began to spread among the local inhabitants. After access to the country was made easier for the Portuguese through construction of a fort in Colombo, Franciscan missionaries were also sent to
Sri Lanka. There were a few Franciscans including a parish priest by the name of Joo Vaz Monteiro in Colombo. His engraved tombstone was discovered in Colombo in 1836. Towards the end of the year 1543, five Franciscans were sent from Portugal to preach here. This was the time missionary St Francis Xavier himself arrived in India. Stories of Xaviers work in South India reached the shores of the island of Mannar in the North West coast of Sri Lanka. Due to the pleading of the people there, Xavier, unable to go himself, sent a fellow missionary to Mannar who converted hundreds of locals, thus spreading the faith in the North of the country. Catholic faith grew in the country since then. King Dharmapala succeeded to the throne in 1551 and thus became a Catholic. 
Franciscan missionaries made a great headway in their evangelization work in Kotte and Jaffna. The Catholic faith spread further when other religious orders such as the Jesuits, Dominicans and Augustinians, arrived in the country as well. The Jesuits arrived in 1602, the Dominicans in 1605, and the Augustinians in 1606. Catholicism took to the back seat with the arrival of the Dutch later in the 17th century, who prohibited Catholicism and gave predominance to their Protestant faith founded by John Calvin. Many Catholics were persecuted. An Indian priest from Goa, Fr. Joseph Vaz, upon hearing of the plight of Sri Lankan Catholics, came to the island in disguise in 1687 and secretly ministered to the Catholics. Later other Indian priests from the Oratory of Goa joined him. They were kindly treated by the Sinhalese Buddhist Kings of Kandy. Fr. Vaz served the church in Sri Lanka to his death in 1711 and is venerated as the Apostle of Sri Lanka. He was beatified by Pope John Paul II in 1995 and was canonized by Pope Francis who visited Sri Lanka in 2015. Throughout the Dutch period, up to 1796, it was these Indian Oratorians, who looked after the Church in Sri Lanka. 
Later after the Dutch left the island with the arrival of the British, various orders were sent to Sri Lanka. These included Oblates of Mary Immaculate from France, Sylvestro Benedictines from Italy, and Jesuits from Belgium. Several womens religious orders also began educational and social work. Most importantly, steps were taken to train Sri Lankan candidates for Priesthood and Religious life. Sri Lanka was established as a part of the diocese of Cochin, India during this period up to 1845. Colombo was created a diocese on February 17, 1845. Colombo was elevated to the rank of a metropolitan archdiocese in 1886-87. Anuradhapura, Badulla, Batticaloa, Chilaw, Galle, Jaffna, Kandy, Kurunegala, Mannar, Ratnapura, and Trincomalee were named as dioceses later. A French oblate Christopher Bonjean, became the first Archbishop of Colombo in 1886. Pope Pius XII named the archdiocese Archdiocese of Colombo in Ceylon on December 6, 1944, but was simplified to The Archdiocese of Colombo on May 22, 1972 by Pope Paul VI. The first Sri Lankan Archbishop, Thomas Benjamin Cooray was appointed in 1947, and in 1965 he also became the first Sri Lankan Cardinal. He retired in 1978 and thus Bishop Nicolas Marcus Fernando succeeded him as the new Archbishop of Colombo. Bishop Oswald Gomis succeed him as the Archbishop of Colombo in 2002 and served till 2009. The current Archbishop of Colombo, appointed by Pope Benedict XVI on June 16, 2009 was appointed cardinal in 2010.

India imposes retaliatory tariffs on US, widening global trade war
	

Washington Post(NEW DELHI) ,JUN 22 2018-India joined the European Union and other U.S. trading partners in retaliating against the Trump administrations tariff hikes on steel and aluminum Thursday by raising import duties on a variety of goods, including almonds, apples and some metal products. 
India had notified the World Trade Organization on June 14 of its decision to increase tariffs on more than two dozen goods from the United States. It is a $241 million measure that matches the amount of steel and aluminum import duty expected to be collected from India by the United States through the tariffs imposed by the Trump administration earlier this year. More than a third of the figure comes from almonds; India is the worlds biggest buyer of U.S.-grown almonds. 
India finalized its decision during a week when the global trade war escalated, with the United States enacting $50 billion in tariffs on Chinese goods and the European Union imposing $3 billion in levies on such products as U.S.-made bourbon, peanut butter and Harley-Davidson motorcycles.

Minister Rajapakshe praised the move to place the distribution of local films under the purview of the National Film Cooperation (NFC).
MP Jayatissa pointed out that the film archive and preservation unit of the NFC was not functioning properly and asked what action would be taken to mitigate the situation. He said the machine imported to preserve local productions during the tenure of former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunge was presently not in use.
In reply the minister said he had called for a report on this and assured the House to keep them informed on the results and future recommendations. (Ajith Siriwardana and Yohan Perera)

Local industries being neglected by import oriented govt.: Dinesh
	
Joint Opposition MP Dinesh Gunawardane yesterday charged that local industries were in crisis due to the government's policy of favouring foreign industrialists and asked what action the government would take to protect local small and medium-scale entrepreneurs.
He told parliament that medium and small-scale industries were in grave crisis due to the increase in the loan interest rates, the rupee depreciation against the dollar and new taxes imposed under the new Inland Revenue Act.
"The cost of doing business here has gone up due to the increase in lending rates. Tax concessions given to industries under the 2006-10 Inland Revenue Act has been removed. New taxes have been imposed under the new Inland Revenue Act introduced in 2017 and by amending the VAT and Cess charges," he said.
Mr. Gunawardane said the local industries were at risk because of the government's lax policy on imports and allowing an influx of foreign products into the country by way of free trade agreements.
He said that production costs had also gone up due to the high cost of imported raw materials as a result of the value of the rupee falling against the dollar.
He pointed out that a number of local industries had already been taken over by foreign companies and added that thousands of local entrepreneurs were at risk of losing their livelihoods as a result.
Industry and Commerce Minister Rishard Bathiudeen said that he did not agree with the views expressed by the MP and pointed out that his ministry had not received any complaints on such matters.
The minister said no new taxes had been introduced under the new Inland Revenue Act and added that the port and civil aviation tax had also been removed for some industries.
He said a programme Enterprise Sri Lanka" initiated by Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera had been launched to provide loans to local entrepreneurs. (Ajith Siriwardana and Yohan Perera)

42 more Indians detained for illegally entering US
	

The Hindu(WASHINGTON), JUNE 22 2018 
The Indian missions have been provided with names of the detained people in Oregon and New Mexico. 
At least 42 Indians are detained in a facility in New Mexico for illegal entry into the United States, in the second such episode that has come to light this week. Earlier this week, it emerged that 52 Indians were being detained in a federal prison in Oregon. 
The U.S agencies enforcing immigration do not automatically notify missions of the countries from where the detainees come. Indian officials approached the Immigration and Customs Enforcement after hearing from community leaders, about the new batch of detainees. The ICE confirmed that at least 42 of the detainees at the Otero County Detention Centre in New Mexico, not far from the El Paso border crossing from Mexico, are Indians. 
It is likely that more cases of Indians being detained will emerge, as the Donald Trump administration continues with its zero tolerance enforcement of immigration laws.

Refugees and widows - Let conscience be our guide
	

This week, the international community marks two important events -- World Refugee Day on June 20 and World Widows Day today. Both refugees and widows have been oppressed or marginalised to a large extent and we need to deeply reflect on the issues. This reflection is essential though the United States President Donald Trump -- who says he wants to make America great again -- has instead created an America alone crisis by his hard or cruel policy against refugees, the latest being the order to separate refugee children from their families. But the chaotic and dangerously-unpredictable US leader revoked his own order under international and internal pressure even from his wife Melania and daughter Ivanka. 
According to the United Nations, in a world where violence forces thousands of families to flee for their lives each day, the time is now to show that the global public stands with refugees. To do this, the UN Refugee Agency launched the #WithRefugees petition in June 2016 to send a message to governments that they must work together and do their fair share for refugees. Last year, the number of refugees was the highest in history and we should be ashamed of it. 
On World Refugee Day held every year on June 20, the international community salutes the strength, courage and perseverance of millions of refugees. This year, World Refugee Day also marks a key moment for the public to show support for families forced to flee. We may be shocked and staggered but it is a horrible fact that every minute 20 people leave everything behind to escape war, persecution or terror. 
There are several types of forcibly displaced people. A refugee is someone who flees his or her home and country owing to a well-founded fear of persecution because of his or her race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion, according to the United Nations 1951 Refugee Convention. Many refugees are in exile to escape the effects of natural or human-made disasters. 
Asylum seekers say they are refugees and have fled their homes as refugees do, but their claim to refugee status is not yet definitively evaluated in the country to which they fled, the UN says. Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) are people who have not crossed an international border but have moved to a different region from the one they call home within their own country. Stateless persons do not have a recognised nationality and do not belong to any country. Stateless situations are usually caused by discrimination against certain groups. Their lack of identification -- such as a citizenship certificate -- could deny them access to important government services including healthcare, education or employment. Returnees are former refugees who return to their own countries or regions of origin after exile. Returnees need continuous support and reintegration assistance to ensure they can rebuild their lives at home. 
Sri Lanka faces some serious problems regarding asylum seekers, internally displaced people and returnees. The coalition government pledged to give priority to these issues, but implementation has been slow. We hope that in the weeks and months to come, effective steps will be taken to give relief to these people and thereby build a just, peaceful and all-inclusive society. 
International Widows Day today is based on the theme Invisible Women, Invisible Problems. Although accurate information is limited, it has been estimated that there are some 285 million widows around the world, more than 115 million of them living in abject poverty. Data on womens status are often not disaggregated by marital status, so at every level of gender statistics, from national to global, widows are not visible. Yet we know that many elderly widows face multiple and intersecting forms of discrimination, based on their gender, age, rural location or disability, the UN says. Others are still young when they lose their husbands, perhaps as a result of conflict or because they were married as children to much older men. These women face a long lifetime of widowhood.
Religious leaders have given a special place to widows. For instance, Jesus Christ spoke of how a poor widow who put her last coin into the temple coffers, gave something much more valuable than the gold or silver given by the rich and ruling elite. Therefore, society also needs to give a special place to widows because it is of great spiritual virtue.

The good die young  and so did Suren
	
Suren Perera, a former Peterite cricketer passed away on May 8, 2018. Suren played a few matches for the 1st Eleven Team for St. Peters College. He was best remembered for the brilliant 73 runs that he scored against Royal College in the under 16 final in 1977. 

St Peters college - 1977 - winners under 16


Just a short recollection of the events at this match. St. Peters College had already played Royal College in a 1st round match and won by 1 wicket in a very tightly fought encounter between the two schools. In this match, Suren was injured (broken tooth) as a result of a bouncer bowled by Sudath Pasqual (Former Sri Lankan Cricketer, Sudath represented Sri Lanka whilst in school in the
1979 World Cup). 
Pasqual was fast, menacing and very deadly on a matting wicket, as youngsters just learning to play the game, we were not equipped to face the rising ball aimed at our throat and head. One should bear in mind in the 70s there was no helmets to protect you against the rising ball, as such many feared to face Pasqual, we were no exception and in the same boat. Pasupathi the other opening fast bowler was equally fast, menacing and deadly, so there was no escape from the other end either, it is said the best way to face good fast bowling is to bat at the non-strikers end, but with Pasupathi operating from the other end this was also a dream. 

Suren was a stylish, an elegant batsman who played some glorious drives, but unfortunately never lived up to his potential that was shown in his younger days
St. Peters College had to play Royal College in the under 16 final in year 1977. St. Peters College won the toss and elected to bat and was progressing well at 117/1 when there was a minor collapse. The undersigned had got out hooking a bouncer of Sudath Pasqual. Pasqual in cricketing parlance was full of confidence and bowling menacingly.
As I was walking back to the pavilion, Suren walked into bat, and whilst crossing each other Suren inquired from me, If Pasqual was bowling fast. I realized that there was no point asking Suren to defend particularly considering what had transpired in our 1st encounter with Royal College, as such I told Suren, Just go for your shots, do not worry if you get out.
As I mentioned Pasqual was with his tail up and the first ball to Suren was a bouncer, which he ducked but with his bat up in the air, the ball hit the bat and flew over the slips
for a boundary.
Thereafter what followed next was sensational, as Suren probably took my advice and decided that attack was the best form of defense and took on Pasqual and the Royal attack. The spectators at the ground were treated to an exhibition of counter attacking batting whilst the Royal attack was literally taken to the cleaners. 

Suren took it up on himself to counter attack Pasqual and the Royal attack and trashed them to all parts of the ground. Suren played a brilliant innings, that was filled with strokes all around the wickets

Suren took it up on himself to counter attack Pasqual and the Royal attack and trashed them to all parts of the ground. Suren played a brilliant innings, that was filled with strokes all around the wickets. Suren hooked, pulled, cut and drove brilliantly and ended up scoring 73 runs in
70 minutes. 
If my memory serves me right when I got out, the score board read as 145/4, St. Peters College ended up being bowled out for 254 runs. After Suren came to the wicket, St. Peters College added another 109 runs of which Suren accounted for 73. This innings helped St. Peters College to win the Under 16 Championship in 1977. The Royal team consisted of eminent cricketers such as Sudath Pasqual and Sumithra Warnakulasuriya, both of whom went on to represent Sri Lanka, in addition there was Gihan Sonnadara, Rohan Jurampathy and K Pasupathi to name a few.  Suren was a stylish, an elegant batsman who played some glorious drives, but unfortunately never lived up to his potential that was shown in his younger days. It may have been because St. Peters cricket in this period, was blessed with an abundance of talent, so probably the lack of opportunity deprived Suren of showing his true potential. As a human being Suren was always with a smile and a true friend, an unassuming lovable character loved by everybody that crossed his path. 
On a personal note, I met Suren one day when my wife and kids were in Sri Lanka on holiday from Australia. Suren being the lovable hospitable character said, Why dont you bring your family for lunch to the Parliament and be my guests. Suren served at the Parliament of Sri Lanka for 34 years and held the position of Director Catering & Housekeeping at the time of his demise. My family & I accepted the invitation, as it is very seldom that one would get an opportunity to have lunch in the parliament. We had a lovely time together. It is heart breaking to think that my dear friend, Suren is no more, as it is said The good die young, I guess this
saying is true. 
My dear friend and cricketing buddy, may the turf lie softly and may your soul rest in peace until we meet again.

Transformed SL to an investment hub from a pariah state: PM
	
The Yahapalana Government has been able to transform Sri Lanka from a debt-ridden, backward pariah state in the third world in 2015 to a respected, investment hub in South Asia by 2018 with a fast growing economy, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said yesterday.
Mr. Wickremesinghe added that no one had any hope for Sri Lanka which was in a huge debt trap and no funds in the Treasury even for day to day expenses.
Participating as the Guest of Honour at the launching of the Entrepreneurs Paradise Loan Scheme  Enterprise Sri Lanka under the Gamperaliya Rural Development Project at the BMICH yesterday, Mr. Wickremesinghe expressed his satisfaction on the achievements of the Yahapalana Government on its sound economic management in the last three years.
You all are aware that Sri Lanka was entangled in a debt trap when we took over the government on January 9, 2015. No one knew how we could escape it. But today, we have not only relaxed the debt burden to an affordable level and increased the exports and Foreign Direct Investment sharply as a result of our sound management of our economic fundamentals. As a result we have hopes for the future and the government has no problem in obtaining loans from foreign countries and global financial agencies, Mr. Wickremesinghe stressed.
He said there was an unprecedented increase in exports and FDI in 2017. The government had launched the novel development project known as Gamperlaiya to enhance family income among the rural sector in particular and accelerate the progress in the industrial sector making the national economy sustainable, steady and strong.

Two rare elephants confined to Sinharaja
	

Sinharaja: Last vestige of primary tropical rain forest
Extinction due to changes in feeding patterns
Lack of historical data a major drawback
20 out of 26 endemic birds in Sinharaja

A recent attempt to relocate two rare elephants from the Sinharaja Forest Reserve created a controversy within environmentalists as the UNESCO would de-list the area as a world heritage site. This led to the intervention of the President who issued a directive that the move to relocate the elephants should be suspended until a proper scientific study was done on whether this transmigration would lead to the extinction of this rare species.
The UNESCO in 1978 designated the Sinharaja Forest Reserve as a biosphere reserve and a world heritage site.

SINHARAJA FOREST RESERVE
Sinharaja is a national park and a biodiversity hotspot in Sri Lanka and the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has identified it as the last vestige of primary tropical rain forest with more than 60 per cent of the trees are endemic or rare.
This hilly virgin rain forest is only 21kms (13mi) from East to West and a maximum of 7kms (13mi) from North to South, but it is a unique area of endemic species including trees, insects, amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals. Wildlife is not seen easily because of the dense vegetation as in the dry-zone national parks like Yala. According to Wikipedia, there were three elephants and 15 leopards, and the common mammal is the endemic purple-faced Langur. One elephant cannot be accounted for at present.
There are 26 endemic birds in Sri Lanka, of which 20 rain forest species occur in Sinharaja. Reptiles include endemic green pit viper, hump-nosed vipers and also rare variety of amphibians, especially tree frogs. There are also invertebrates like common bird wing, butterfly and leeches.

ELEPHANT POPULATION
The Sri Lanka elephant (Elephas maximus maximus) is the largest four subspecies of Asian elephants. Historical records show that a large wild elephant population was known to inhabit the island for past centuries and there was a tradition of domestication.
The population figures in 2006 were as follows; Elephant range - 15 000 Km2; Country ranking - 7 of 13; Total wild elephants  2100-3000; Country ranking 4th, 5th of 13; Total captive population  200-250 and country ranking 7th of 13 (Source: R. Sukumar - A Brief review of the status, distribution and biology of wild Asian elephants Elephus maximus International Zoo Yearbook 2006)

My recommendation is to move these elephants from Sinharaja to be taken care of separately in an elephant orphanage, so that our specialists could study their anatomical changes and aggressive nature

FOREST COVER AND BIO-DIVERSITY
In 2005, the forest cover was 1,933,000 (ha), out of a total land area of 6,463, 000 (ha) and was 29.91 per cent. However, the primary forest cover is only 167 000 (ha) which is only 8.64 per cent of the total forest and only 2.58 per cent of total land area. This area is the most bio-diverse form of forest (Source: MONGABAY.COM).
Sri Lanka has some known species of amphibians, birds, mammals and reptiles. Of these, 21.7 per cent are endemic, meaning they exist in no other country and 11.9 per cent are threatened (World Conservation Monitoring Centre). Sri Lanka is home to at least 3,314 species of vascular plants of which 26.9 per cent are endemic. 9.6 per cent is protected under IUCN categories 1-V (IUCN Red List of Threatened Species http://www.iucnredlist.org/static/castegories-criteria_3_1)

SINHARAJA ELEPHANTS
The two elephants seen in the print and electronic media resemble an elephant measuring about 5 feet in height and resemble a dwarf elephant seen in the dry zone, especially around the Kataragama hill range.
The elephants small stature was due to disproportionately short legs, according to the findings published in the IUCN/SSC Asian Elephant Specialist Group Journal Gajah. It was observed that this elephant was seen in an aggressive encounter with another male of average size. The dwarf was by far the main aggressor in an altercation and appeared to be older than the other a young adult, the study states.
If you think about it, most animals, especially mammals, are either predators or prey. If you are either and are born with short limbs you would be at a very big disadvantage, Prithiviraj Fernando of the Centre for Conservation and Research and one of the authors of the paper told MONGABAY.COM
A dwarf prey animal is likely to be caught by a predator and similarly, a dwarf predator would find it very difficult to catch prey. So such individuals are very unlikely to survive in the wild. Elephants in Sri Lanka are unique (together with those in Borneo) in that they have no predators, so he was very lucky that he was born here.

Pastorini, J. and Fernando. 2013 Disproportionate dwarfism in a wild Asian elephant.Gajah.38, 30 -32 URL:http://www.asesg.org/garjh38.htm)

RECOMMENDATIONS
From the above facts, it is most likely that the two or three elephants at Sinharaja can be grouped under dwarf elephants or Kuru Ali that roam about in the dense forests of Kataragama, and I personally encountered one of them during my field surveys as a geologist mapping the area in 1965.
It is now revealed that in 2013 a group of scientists had studied these elephants that are aggressive. It is also likely that there had been more of this variety (Elephas maximums) but got extinct due to change in feeding patterns with climate change.
Scientists are now concerned over climate change as it causes the shifting of the natural cycle of life and with the rise in global temperature, it may cause plants to produce fruits and flowers during off seasons. However, lack of historical data and continuous monitoring of these changes in Sri Lanka is a major drawback.
In this article, I have attempted to prove that the two or three surviving elephants are unique and should be preserved. It is most likely that they will not survive in their present surroundings with rise in temperature that will have an adverse effect in their surroundings and the lack of preferred feeding grounds.
My recommendation is to move these elephants from Sinharaja to be taken care of separately in an elephant orphanage, so that our specialists could study their anatomical changes and aggressive nature.
I hope this will not cause any agitation among the conservationists and lead to mobo-cracy a significant part of democracy in Sri Lanka. It is also recommended whether the scientists could locate more of these dwarf elephants that are now with the Handapangala herd and would have survived. Areas around Kataragama are a good bet to look for more of these dwarfs or Kuru Ali.

Two Sinharaja elephants will suffer same fate as the leopard: Thewarapperuma
	
The two elephants in the Sinharaja forest will suffer the same fate as the leopard which was killed recently if they remain in the Sinharaja forest, Wildlife Deputy Minister Palitha Thewarapperuma said yesterday.
Wildlife Minister Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka and Deputy Minister Thewarapperuma initially attempted to take the two animals out of the forest reserve but President Maithripala Sirisena stopped them from doing it, he said.
Deputy Minister Thewarapperuma said this during an adjournment debate moved by Joint Opposition MP Wimalaweera Dissanayake who urged the government to resolve human- animal conflicts.
The villagers are planning to kill the two elephants and therefore they will suffer the same fate as the leopard which was killed recently. This is why Minister Fonseka and I decided to take them to an elephant transit home. We were going to keep the two animals in the transit home temporarily, the Deputy Minister said.
We went into action even without veterinary specialists and had to get the two from Sri Lanka Air force. President Maithripala Sirisena who called us as soon as we started the operation to transfer the elephants advising us to do it carefully. However seconds later the Air Force Commander informed us that the President had ordered the two air force specialists to leave the place. The President also called us soon after and advised us to tie the two elephants and keep them, he said.
Mr. Thewarapperuma said the two animals will be kept in a hundred acre land within the Sinharaja. Both Minister Fonseka and I will personally attend to the needs of these animals, he added.
He revealed that villagers in Kalawana tortured the mother of the two male elephants which he and his minister tried to move.
The Deputy Minister stressed on a joint effort to resolve the human animal conflicts. He said politics has prevented resolving this conflict. The human animal conflict had become a national issue because of politics, he said. (Yohan Perera and Ajith Siriwardana)

Commenting on the decision by the United States to quit from the UNHRC, Tamil National Alliance (TNA) MP M. A. Sumanthiran said his party would work with other countries that co-sponsored the resolution on Sri Lanka to ensure that its provisions were implemented.
He said there were four key countries that co-sponsored this resolution  the United States, Britain, Montenegro and Macedonia.
He said, in the absence of the US in the UNHRC, the other three countries would follow it up.
Also, he said the resolution on Sri Lanka was adopted unanimously on two occasions.
Sri Lanka also co-sponsored it twice. Therefore, there should be no dispute on that. Sri Lanka has committed twice to the international community, he said.
To that extent, it will be obliged, he said.
Asked whether it would be challenging without the US, he said the role of that country was crucial when votes were taken on resolutions on Sri Lanka in 2012 and 2013. However, he said that there was a consensus resolution at the moment. (Kelum Bandara)

## Title: War-War and Jaw-Jaw

War-War and Jaw-Jaw
	

Give the man a break. Donald Trump found out in Singapore that, as Churchill said, Jaw-Jaw is better than War-War. If war can be avoided by a warm, long, very private chat without advisers, with effusive body gestures and promises of a world stage when his opponent, Kim Jong-un is invited to the White House, then Trump has shown the way.
It was learning the hard way because a few months ago when Trump threatened to incinerate North Korea he met counter threats from North Korea that could have led to the deaths of 30 million people in South Korea alone, never mind what numbers might die in an attack on American troops stationed in Japan and Guam naval base.
I have no proof but I do think Trump can make a grand peace with North Korea unlike his predecessors. They too had the will but were defeated by a Republican-dominated Congress that made implementation on what was agreed as impossible, and in George W. Bushs case a refusal to build on Bill Clintons effective diplomacy. Trump, if he wills it, will have no trouble with Congress. As many commentators have said, if Barack Obama or Clinton had done a Singapore there would have been a big move to have them impeached.

I have no proof but I do think Trump can make a grand peace with North Korea unlike his predecessors. They too had the will but were defeated by a Republican-dominated Congress that made implementation on what was agreed as impossible

If peace arrives this will turn modern American, European and Russian military history on its head. The record over the last 70 years has been appalling.
The UN Charter was conceived during the Second World War. Drafts were written in the basement of the US State Department. It prohibited the unilateral use of force. Force can only be used if the Security Council supports it.
In April last year, President Donald Trump launched an attack on Syria to retaliate for chemical weapons used by the government against its own people. The Security Council was ignored.
In September last year, four Israeli jets fired a volley of missiles at a Syrian government facility that probably produced chemical weapons. Israel, as usual, didnt ask the Security Council for approval.
Four years ago, Russia took over the Ukrainian territory of Crimea without Security Council arbitration or authorisation.
French President Francois Hollande was ready to back Obamas plan to invade Syria. Only a last minute change of mind forestalled it -- Obama was much influenced by a vote in the British Parliament that forbade its government to participate in airstrikes unless the UN approved them.
In the early years of his presidency, Obama decided to go to war with the regime of Muammar Gaddafi in Libya, with the active support of a number of European countries. This time they sought Security Council authorisation, which they were given. But Russia reasonably felt it had been seriously misled. Rightly, it argued, the resolution it had supported said it was to keep the peace, not to kill Gaddafi. Later, as internal fighting wrecked the country, Obama volunteered that this was his worst mistake.
China has intimidated its neighbours into passivity, building military installations on islands and rocks in the South China Sea. One can presume these will be used, if the need arises, without asking the Security Council for permission. Likewise, if China invades Taiwan which it keeps threatening to with an ever louder voice it will not seek permission from the UN, nor will the US-- as in 1996 -- if it sends in a naval force to police the Taiwan Strait. Further back there were the US wars in Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos, the US invasions of Granada, Panama and the Dominican Republic, the mining of Nicaraguas main port, the NATO bombing of Belgrade and later the NATO war with the Serbs over Kosovo and the US/British invasion of Iraq. None of these actions sought UN approval.
As for the Soviet Union, it sent in tanks to crush the uprisings in Hungary and Czechoslovakia. Later it
invaded Afghanistan.
What a record of abuse of the Charter. But if the US and Europe break the rules why shouldnt Russia and China And vice versa. Nevertheless, the rules have often been observed. The US, the EU, Russia, China and a host of smaller countries have worked to make the Charter and peacekeeping effective and have pushed forward the boundaries of international law, peacekeeping and humanitarian practice. This has been one powerful reason why the number of wars has precipitously declined since the end of the Second World War. Today, there is not one interstate war and the number of civil wars has decreased since the end of the Cold War (although in recent years civil wars in the Middle East and Africa have pushed the graph measuring wars up again). Humankind has become less violent. 99% of the world is not at war.
If Trump could make a deal with North Korea it would be a momentous victory for Jaw-Jaw and the UN Charter. Only fools believe in War-War.

We are still under MR, say 16 SLFP rebels
	
Member of the SLFP of 16 rebels, former Minister W.D.J Seneviratne, while dismissing alleged remarks made against the group by certain members of the Joint Opposition said they would remain in politics under the leadership of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa and contest the forthcoming PC, Presidential and Parliamentary polls under his leadership.
He added that the 16 SLFP rebels would sit in Parliament with the Joint Opposition from the next session as their sole objective was to build a strong front against the UNP.
He told the media at the Media Center of Freedom in Colombo that his group had become a threat to the 23 SLFPers remaining in the Unity Government led by the UNP.
Our group has been able to draw the attention of the entire country. The best example of this is the two rallies held in Matara and Matale by us.
On the popularity, we have gained among the public we have decided to conduct rallies and meetings against the UNP round the country, Mr Seneviratne said.
He stressed that the rebel group quit the Yahapalana Government on May 8 with the sole objective of toppling this Government as early as possible.
As such, the group has made a big political impact in the country to get an early election with the support of the JO. The Joint Opposition would get the full blessings and support of the group to perform as the real Opposition to the Government under Mahinda Rajapaksas leadership and advice, he said.
Parliamentarian Dilan Perera said the UNP and the SLFP group who do business with the Government make various malice and vituperative remarks on the 16 rebels and the group was a good topic among the UNP and 23 SLFPers.
How could they say that 14 out of 16 had become political refugees and see us as Billa Almost all SLFPers, except a few in the Government, will quit before long and join us. Those who insulting us are keeping their legs on both sides, he said.
We quit the Government because we felt that the Government was to get defeated. A group of 16 Ministers has never quit a Government in the past.
In the past, the crossovers were from the Opposition to Government. In this instance, it was the opposite. We had the opportunity to remain as Ministers until 2020. Duminda cannot do politics as an underdog of the UNP. We left the Government to save the SLFP from the UNP. We cannot let Mahinda Amaraweera offer the SLFP to the UNP any further. They are trying to give the SLFP in a flower tray, he said.
He said that the 16 SLFP rebels were in constant touch with the 23 SLFPers in the Government and would take them out before long.
The SLFP will contest under one leader after Mahinda Rajapaksa and President Sirisena comes to a compromise. However, the defeat of the JO at the election of the Deputy Speaker was a setback to the JO.
All those who opposed the No-Confidence Motion against Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe have now been made destitute, Mr Perera said. (Sandun A Jayasekera)

Will not let terrorism rise again: Dy. Minister
	
In reference to the incident, where several military type equipment and uniform belonging to the LTTE were detected in a three-wheeler at the Peraru Junction in Oddusuddan on Thursday, Deputy Minister of Law and Order Nalin Bandara said yesterday the Government would not allow terrorism to raise its head again.
Addressing a news briefing, he said the Terrorist Investigation Division (TID) officers were conducting a special investigation into the incident.
Since Sri Lanka is a country, which was embroiled in a civil war for nearly 30 years, it is not surprising that buried weapons are being found in areas where there was a war at one time, Minister said.
But we should make sure whether these types of incidents would challenge the national security. The Government along with the tri-forces is always alert on these actions and would take necessary steps accordingly, Minister added.
Investigations are underway to find out whether there is secret movement or organization that assists the scattered LTTEers to reorganize again, Minister added.
Meanwhile, he said stringent actions would be taken against those who killed a leopard in Kilinochchi.
We have got clear video clips of the events, which show how the leopard was killed. Therefore, we will take actions to apprehend those who were involved in this killing, the Minister said. (Sheain Fernandopulle)

Zimbabwe President survives explosion at rally
	
Zimbabwe President Emmerson Mnangagwa has survived an apparent bomb attack in the city of Bulawayo, BBC reported.
Video footage from White City Stadium appears to show an explosion happening close to Mr. Mnangagwa as he was leaving the stage having addressed supporters.
He was not hurt, his spokesman said. But senior officials are among those injured, Zimbabwe media say.
President Mnangagwa came into power last November, ousting his former mentor Robert Mugabe.
The president was in Bulawayo, Zimbabwe's second city, to campaign for his Zanu-PF party ahead of nationwide elections taking place on 30 July.
The elections are the first in Zimbabwe since Mr. Mugabe was ousted after 37 years in power.
Presidential spokesman George Charamba issued a statement recalling: "There have been multiple attempts on the president's life over the past five years."
