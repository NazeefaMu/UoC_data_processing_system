A director who has gone nuts about a new actress
	
A new tele-drama is being shot on location in the Bandaragama area these days under the direction of a talented dramatist. Its female lead role is being played by a new actress.
The director has gone absolutely nuts about the young actress and is said to be more interested in cooing to the girl than about the shoot, they say.
The director is so absorbed in watching the actress when she is in action, he would forget to cry cut just when the scene is over, they say.
However, when it comes to shooting scenes where the girl has no part to play, the director is in a mighty hurry to finish the job in double quick time so that he could rush back to her to make love.
The director is so impressed with the acting of the girl; he is often repeating a vow that he would take her to the great heights reached by the popular film star Swarna Mallawarachchi.
The directors silly behaviour is a source of amusement to the others on the set and they add that it is an insult to the great star of yester- year to boast he would make this girl a celebrity like Swarna Mallawarachchi.

A lesson in salesmanship
	

A strange character had been calling on the leading film and tele-drama directors in the recent past.

Once he meets a film or a tele-drama director, this character would ask the latter: Sir, do you know that you incur big losses by trying to cut down on expenses
A surprised director would naturally ask: What do you mean by cutting down expenses
The stranger: Sir, you ought to know that you are catering to an enlightened audience today. Our film goers, tele-drama viewers cannot be easily hoodwinked or deceived!
Hoodwinking What is the trick we are playing on our fans
Its like this, the strange character explains. Take this scene for an example. Father of the family returns home in the evening tired and grim after the days hard work to find the entire family with their eyes glued to the TV. None of them takes any notice of his arrival. How would an angry father react to the dont care attitude of his wife and children He would raise the TV and dash it on the floor! But you dont care to shoot an incident like that because it would cost the price of a TV! You want to save money at the cost of deviating from gritty realism!
So what do you suggest
Sir, I can help you to make such scenes realistic at a minimal cost I have a large stock of TVs, refrigerators and washing machines of various models and sizes. Of course, they are not in working order. I can offer them all at a reasonable price so that they would come handy whenever the need arises for battering them into wreckage to give a realistic touch to certain scenes!
But how on earth did you collect such a large stock of TVs, fridges and washing machines
Sir, its nothing to be surprised about if you know the amount of electric goods like TVs the people in certain city suburbs had to discard after their houses went under flood waters for several days. I thought it was a crime to condemn these appliances as junk. So I collected them all to put them to some sort of good use. He adds after a brief pause. After all, Sir, we too should make a living!

Govt. has agreed on foreign monitors, not judges: SF
	
The government had agreed to allow foreign monitors and obtain international technical assistance for machinery that would be set up to probe alleged human right violations during the war time, Provincial Development Minister Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka said today.
Field Marshal Fonseka told a media briefing that both President Maithripala Sirisena, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe were favourable towards foreign monitors and obtaining technical assistance from countries to a machinery that would be set up to probe human right violations during the war time, while highlighting that the government was not in favour of including foreign judges.
He was responding to a a statement made by US Assistant Secretary of State for South and Central Asian Affairs Nisha Biswal who had called for a credible probe. Foreign judges cannot be allowed to engage in a probe as the Sri Lankan Constitution does not provide provisions for such a thing, the Field Marshal added.
Further he dismissed the claim made by some international organizations that the security forces used cluster bombs during the war. (Yohan Perera)

He got L for his I decades later
	

There is a veteran film artiste residing in Panadura area. He had another house given on rent by the side of the Galle road.

None of the artistes children or his grandchildren wanted this extra house and he decided to sell it.
So the artiste put adverts in the Press and websites to sell the house. However, none of the prospective buyers offered a reasonable price for the valuable property. They all wanted to buy it dirt cheap. He was determined not to sell it for anything short of Rs.9.5 million.
Later he put up a sign board at the turn off from the Galle road to his house on sale displaying a picture of the house and a direction-indicating arrow mark followed by a conspicuous  150 m on it. But no buyers turned up for some time.
One day a lady who came by in a car called on the artiste. She said that she happened to notice the sign board. Are you in your proper senses Do you think that you can find a buyer willing to pay Rs.150 million for this house One can buy a better house in Colombo 7 for a much lesser amount!
But, Madam, we are not naming such a high price for the house. Who told you this Rs.150 million story
But the sign board at the turn off says that the house is on sale for 150 ml. Doesnt it mean Rs.150 million
You are mistaken, Madam. We have said: 150 M meaning 150 meters  the distance from the Galle road to the house on sale.
The artiste immediately went to the location where the sign board stood and found someone had added the letter L after M.
Members of the artistes family circle were very angry and were cursing the unknown author of this act of mischief. However, the artiste looked calm and serene.
There is a saying that you reap what you sow, when I was quite young I played a similar prank, he told his children.
Tell us that story, Papa, they requested.
There was a posh house to be rented out in our village. The owner put up a TO LET sign board opposite that house. One day, in the night I drew the letter I to fill the mid-space to make it read TOILET!

Lakvijaya coal tender: Patali rejects any involvement
	
Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka today rejected having any involvement in awarding a tender to supply coal for the Lakvijaya Coal Power Plant which had incurred a loss of Rs. 1.2 billion to the state.
Minister Ranawaka said the controversial tender had been presented to the Cabinet in September 22, 2015 at a time when he was no longer the power and energy minister.
However, I wrote a letter to President Maithripala Sirisena informing him about the tender which was already before the Procurement Appeal Board which comes under the purview of the President. In my letter which was sent in August 13, 2015, I requested him to cancel the tender and call for fresh bids. After the tender was challenged in Supreme Court, it too gave an order to cancel the tender and to call for fresh bids, he told a news conference held at the ministry.
He reiterated that he was not responsible for the controversial tender and said he only shared the collective responsibility of the Cabinet for approving it.
During a news conference on Wednesday, UPFA MP Wasudeva Nanayakkara alleged the arrangements were made by Minister Ranawaka to award the tender and later on Minister Ranjitha Siyambalapitiya was dragged into the blunder. He called for a parliamentary select committee to look into the coal tender issue.
Rejecting the claims, Minister Ranawaka said he would take legal action against MP Nanayakkara for making baseless allegations.
These are the people who had no backbone to raise their voice or to leave the Cabinet when corrupt deals were taking place. Then ministers charged of having an economic hit man but did nothing but we left the Cabinet and the corrupt government, he said.
Commenting on the call for a parliament select committee to look into the coal tender, Minister Ranawaka said he would wholeheartedly agree for such a move and that in fact it should look into all tenders and deals of coals taken place since 2009.
If Im responsible for anything, it is for resulting in a profit of Rs.1,803 million to the Ceylon Electricity Board by introducing spot tendering, he said.
Meanwhile, he said that it was a well known secret that there was a coal mafia in the country and charged a powerful daughter was involved in the Noble Resources Company, which has been awarded the tender.(Lahiru Pothmulla)

Keen to beat Sri Lanka in its own spin game, Australia has roped in local spin great Muttiah Muralitharan to help its slow bowlers ahead of the three-test series beginning at Pallekele later this month.
The 44-year-old former off-spinner, still the highest wicket-taker in test cricket with 800 scalps, had a similar short-term consulting stint with Australia in 2014.
"Murali's got a lot of experience in Sri Lanka," Australian captain Steve Smith said. "He took a truckload of wickets.
"It's great to have someone like that helping our spinners in this series - to give us that insight. He's been really good around the group so far, and he's enjoying his time with us."

## Title: National trade policy by end of August - Ministry

National trade policy by end of August - Ministry
	
The Ministry of Development Strategies & International Trade said yesterday it would formulate the National Trade Policy by the end of next month by incorporating inputs from all stakeholders through a broad-based consultative process.
During the recent deliberations between Development Strategies & International Trade Minister Malik Samarawickrema and his Indian counterpart, an agreement was reached to begin technical-level discussions on the Economic and Technology Cooperation Agreement (ETCA) in the 3rd week of this month, the ministry said in a statement.
Following is the full statement:
The Sri Lankan Government is deeply committed to integrate with the regional and global economies to enhance foreign direct investment, exports and to transform and re-balance the economy of Sri Lanka. India is Sri Lankas largest trade partner -- first in terms of imports, third in terms of exports and fifth in terms of FDI. Similarly China too is an important trade partner with an overall trade volume of closer to US $ 4 billion, contributing immensely towards the economic development of the country in infrastructure development, enhancing port capacity, connectivity and mobility.
Since the Indo-Sri lanka Free Trade Agreement (ISLFTA) executed in 1998, there had been many deliberations between the two countries on a Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA), which was stalled. Negotiations on a Free Trade Agreement with China also commenced in 2013 and two rounds of technical level deliberations have already taken place in April and November 2014.
Recent high level visits and engagements with India and China have improved the overall landscape for strengthening bilateral relationships and the leaders of India, China and Sri Lanka have made strong commitments towards enhancing and deepening the bilateral trade relationships. While recognizing the asymmetries of the economies of Sri Lanka, India and China, the parties acknowledge the great potential and opportunities that exist in integrating the economic activities, to boost the somewhat lagging Sri Lankan economy. Given the current global economic situation the Ministry is of the view that time is most opportune to explore aggressively & pragmatically novel ways and means of enhancing bilateral economic relations with India and China taking into account the differences of the industrial and economic structures of the countries.
In the above positive backdrop, fresh round of negotiations were initiated with India to transform the existing ISLFTA into a more comprehensive Economic and Technology Cooperation Agreement (ETCA). It needs to be reiterated that ETCA is novel in its content and approach and not a continuation of CEPA.
Simultaneously, it is also decided to initiate negotiations on a new comprehensive FTA with China, expanding the scope to include investment and technology cooperation. The existing FTA with Pakistan too will be invigorated exploiting more trade and investment opportunities. Going forward, the Government intends to initiate deliberations on a bilateral trade agreement with Singapore as well, and preliminary discussions in these regards are ongoing.
With preferential access to India, Pakistan, China and Singapore, and the resurrection of GSP+ concession with EU, Sri Lanka will be well placed to act as a hub and a gateway for investors seeking to access the larger, fast growing and emerging markets, on a preferential basis.
In this context the Ministry of Development Strategies and International Trade which plays a lead role in all international trade and investment deliberations wishes to clarify following positions it had taken, pursuant to many consultations with relevant stakeholders.
1. Drafting of the new agreement with India is in progress and a transparent and proactive consultative process too has been initiated with all relevant stakeholders, including the business and industry chambers, the United Professionals Movement (UPM), professional bodies and other public and private sector stakeholders. The new agreement  Economic and Technology Cooperation Agreement (ETCA), encompasses deepening of the goods sector, and will include services and investments, bringing in investment, technological know-how, training, and capacity building in Sri Lanka. It is envisaged that deliberations between the parties would lead to resolution of the critical constraints in the ISLFTA, as an early harvest, and eventually ETCA will replace the existing ISLFTA.
2. During the recent deliberations between the Hon. Minister of Development Strategies & International Trade and his Indian counterpart, an agreement was reached to commence technical-level discussions on ETCA in 3rd week of July 2016.
3. Similarly, China too has expressed its interest to re-launch the dialogue on the China Sri Lanka Free Trade Agreement, and a Chinese delegation is expected to visit Sri Lanka in early August for next round of deliberations.
4. Given due cognizance to the concerns raised by UPM, the Ministry while reiterating its commitment to engage in transparent and ongoing consultations with all stakeholders have decided to establish a Joint Working Group (JWG) encompassing all pertinent stakeholders before end of July 2016, with the approval of the Cabinet Sub Committee on Economic Management/Cabinet of Ministers. The Ministry will coordinate and extend their best support to facilitate such consultations in an ongoing basis and to make them transparent, productive, focused and result oriented. It is the intension of the Ministry to complete all deliberations and execute ETCA by the end of this year. Similarly the FTA with China is expected to be finalised by early next year.
5. The need for, and absence of a comprehensive National Trade Policy to guide the futuristic trade deliberations of the country were highlighted by many, and emerged as a recommendation in the ongoing consultative process with the UPM. Ministry wishes to express that it has already embarked upon formulating a National Trade Policy in consultation with Chambers, UPM and other professional bodies, which will focus on the linkages and inter-connectivity between trade and other economic policies, trade and investment nexus or export-seeking FDI, reducing the anti-export bias in our policies while reviewing the para tariffs and introducing reforms towards improving trade facilitation, enabling Sri Lanka to capitalize on its strategic geographical location. The objective of the Ministry is to formulate the National Trade Policy by the end of August 2016, incorporating inputs from all stakeholders through a broad-based consultative process.
6. The UPM as well as Chambers have also urged the GOSL to update and improve the existing legal framework to be in par with such regimes adopted by our trading partners, avoiding any possible negative and detrimental implications. The Ministry has agreed to facilitate and enable expeditious review of legal regimes related to professional services to ensure service quality, visa and tax laws, accreditation process for foreign professionals and enact relevant amendments prior to liberalizing any services in bilateral trade agreements stated above.
7. Further, the Ministry demonstrating its true commitment towards transparent engagement with the relevant stakeholders will allocate a seat for a common representative from Chambers and Professionals in the respective bilateral negotiating teams.
The ultimate objective of the Ministry and the GOSL is to ensure a transparent and an inclusive process in developing international trade for the benefit of the country and its people, paving way to attract much needed foreign direct investment, access to international markets, adoption of latest technologies and know-how, capacity building and enhancing its competitiveness and trade within and outside the region, all of which will result in Sri Lanka having developed enterprises, quality goods and services and a developed job market transforming and rebalancing the economy.

People paid VAT for exempted services: former CJ
	
Imposing VAT increment on services, which were exempt, was illegal and people had already paid the extra money, former Chief Justice Sarath N. Silva said yesterday
People have already paid 15 per cent as VAT in the healthcare sector, which is a VAT exempted service, he said.
If a Bill was presented in Parliament to implement VAT, it is in effect from the date it was presented in Parliament. Normally, a Parliament decision is implemented after it is passed in Parliament. Parliament, however, has the power to implement such decisions with retrospective effect, he said.
This decision to increase VAT was made to meet the requirements of the IMF. However, the Government has only received US $ 220 million thus far, the former Chief Justice said.
The Value Added Tax (VAT) was increased from 11 to 15 percent hurriedly due to the requirement of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to obtain the first tranche of the US $1.5 billion loan, Silva claimed.
The VAT was increased to the previous 11 to 15 on May 2 this year.
The Supreme Court interim order suspending the implementation of revisions made to the VAT and the Nation Building Tax (NBT) is correct, he said.
Taxes cannot be imposed without the approval of Parliament but it can give its power to some other person or a party, to take decisions on tax, he said. (Chaturanga Pradeep and Indika Sri Aravinda)

The Government has decided to increase the tax imposed on tobacco companies to 90 per cent and the relevant Cabinet paper will be submitted to the Cabinet when it next meets Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne said today.
He said the previous government had imposed a tax of 67% on tobacco companies but the then R. Premadasa government had imposed a 90 per cent tax on tobacco companies.
He said the revenue from tax on tobacco would be higher than that collected from the VAT and as such it would be removed shortly.
We imposed the VAT as a temporarily measure. It will be removed soon, he said.
The minister said he had requested the government that all the taxes imposed on health services be removed while increasing the tax imposed on tobacco companies. (Ajith Siriwardena)

TNA on UNHRC resolution
	
The Tamil National Alliance (TNA) said yesterday that it would support the government to implement the proposals of the UNHRC resolution on Sri Lanka.
TNA MP M.A. Sumanthiran said the resolution clearly states how to implement the proposals and opinions should be expressed only when the mechanisms are being created to implement these proposals.
There are different opinions expressed with affect to the reconciliation mechanism and there is no point us making more comments in this regard at this level. We should only make comments when the plans are being made, he told the journalists outside the US Ambassadors Official Residence in Colombo 7.
A group of TNA MPs led by Opposition Leader R. Sampanthan held discussions with visiting US Assistant Secretary of State for Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor Tom Malinowski and Assistant Secretary of State for South and Central Asian Affairs Nisha Desai Biswal at the Ambassadors Residence.
The MP said the new Constitution of the Government, UNHRC resolutions and the actions taken in this regard were discussed during the discussions held with the two US diplomats.
The US assured that it would always assist Sri Lanka in its measures to find solutions to the national question by bringing in all ethnic groups and with the consultation of all stakeholders in the mechanism of reconciliation, he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

VAT amendments not included in the second reading: Minister
	
The Government will not present the proposed amendments to the VAT for the second reading in Parliament next Wednesday (20), State Finance Minister Lakshmana Yapa Abeywardana said today.
A four member ministerial committee will submit a new set of proposals to President Maithripala Sirisena on Sunday (17) on how further relief can be provided on essential commodities, he said.
Addressing the weekly SLFP media briefing at the party office Minister Abeywardana said VAT increase was not effective on any single commodity or service now and if any trader of service provider charged the increased 4 percent it was illegal and punishable under the law.
Responding to a journalist on charging of VAT by certain retail outlets, private hospitals and telecommunication companies, Minister Abeywardana said it was a violation of the law and the Government would take steps to rectify it, either by taking legal action against errant traders, telecommunication companies and private hospitals or make them repay the illegal tax collection.

Will be there as SLs friend and partner: US
	
The United States yesterday assured that it would remain with Sri Lanka as a friend and partner in the endeavor of developing the country.
Addressing an event held in Colombo organised by the US Embassy on Sri Lanka and US economic relations, the visiting Assistant Secretary of State for South and Central Asian Affairs Nisha Biswal said that Sri Lanka had always had tremendous potential and in fact it was tipped to become the next Japan 50 years ago.
All the fundamentals were there including a well educated population, higher per capita of GDP and the strategic location. But the potential was not fully realised. Later on, the terrible civil conflict, and tragic natural disasters struck the country, she said.
She said even after the war, the lack of reconciliation kept the country divided and the economy weak, but that was no longer the case today.
Sri Lanka again has the opportunity, the will, support, commitment, accountability, good governance, good faith and efforts by the Government.
Now Sri Lanka can become the success economic story it meant to be. It can become the next Singapore and we will be there as a friend and partner, she said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)
