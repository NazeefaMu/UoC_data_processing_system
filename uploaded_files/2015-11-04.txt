AIA lists 5 biggest regrets at retirement
	
When should you start planning for your retirement? ?Certainly not when you?re only a few weeks away from your last day at work! ?
When you are young and enjoying your career, the last thing you want to think about is your old age and retirement. Yet it is best to prepare for retirement early when costs are affordable and you have a longer period to build a fund. Take a few tips from those who have retired so that you make the best out of your evening years. ?
Spending too much in one?s peak years ? Spending money, especially when you?re earning a good salary is easy. ?Plus there are credit cards and loans to repay that make saving for the future tougher. ?But the wise decision is to balance your spending carefully ? particularly during your peak years because you?ll need that extra money most when the peak tapers off. ?
Retiring too early ? Retiring at the right time should be your focus as retiring too early can leave you with less time to save and bring you a longer retirement period with a reduced inflow of income. ?Far better to work as long as you can and let your fund accumulate with compounded returns over a longer time so that you?ll have more money later, when you really need it the most. ?
Not planning for all that free time. If you are used to working full time, filling all that free time during retirement can be a big challenge. Ideally, you should cultivate hobbies and other activities before you retire so that you?re not overwhelmed by the free time.?
Not having a plan to supplement your retirement income.?
When you are working full time you rarely have time to enjoy your hobbies or think about what you can do to supplement your income. Retirement provides you the opportunity to put to good use all your experience and expertise gained during your career and also perhaps to do something completely different that you enjoy.?
Not taking better care of one?s health. Entering retirement in ill health may reduce both quality of life and finances. Maintaining optimum health throughout life and specifically ?going into training? leading up to retirement, can make your retirement the best years of your life. But don?t despair if your health is less than perfect when you hit retirement. Many retirees are able to improve their health once retired, when they have more time to devote to fitness.
Your retirement should be a time where you will enjoy the fruits of all your hard work. The pension you receive should make your retirement comfortable and secure. ?Therefore, you must plan for a regular income during your retirement, well in advance, keeping in mind that there could even be catastrophic events such as illness, to face.?
Suren Perera, Head of Marketing at AIA said: ??Surprisingly a lot of people have the perception that EPF and other funds you contribute to all your working life will take care of your retirement, only to realise too late that it isn?t sufficient for the lifestyle you want to maintain. So planning for a regular pension is good sense.? ?
Advice on how much you will actually need for your retirement and solutions to help you plan for your retirement can be easily obtained from AIA Wealth Planners or by calling 011 2310310.?

Customer service, innovation key to bank?s success : Sampath MD
	
? ?Aravinda Perera
Sampath Bank continues to add to their list of global and local accolades, most recently being recognised as the Best Commercial and Retail Bank in Sri Lanka by the World Finance Magazine for the second consecutive year, as well as being ranked number seven amongst the Top 10 Most Respected Entities in Sri Lanka by the LMD magazine?s 11th edition of Most Respected Entities.
Commenting on the significance of these awards, Managing Director of Sampath Bank, Aravinda Perera said, ?Sampath Bank is not new to winning awards. During the last few years we won Euro Money three years running and The Banker twice, and this is the second consecutive time we have been named the Best Commercial and Retail Bank by World Finance Magazine. ?We are happy our efforts have been appreciated by internationally reputed financial experts.?
The World Finance Magazine is a critically acclaimed bi-monthly magazine providing in-depth coverage and analysis of the financial industry. Renowned for its insightful, current and credible reporting, the magazine?s intensely valued rankings regularly evaluate global companies against their peers.
?LMD is one of the oldest and most recognised local financial magazines that has consistently maintained very high standards. ?Millions of people read these magazines and we are very honoured to have not only been given these awards by them but raised our profile locally and globally through them,? Perera added.Core values of service and innovation
According to the Managing Director, Sampath Bank?s core values of service and innovation are at the centre of such significant success. From inception, the Bank has focused on the customer and ensuring that their needs are not only met, but exceeded, by creating innovative and personalised business solutions.?
Perera says, ?By creating this culture of care and excellence we have managed to impact the market significantly and stay ahead of our competition. We are comparatively a young bank but because of our commitment to our customers we have managed to be recognised within and outside of Sri Lanka.?
This is a very credible achievement. Financial services and banking is at the forefront of the next wave of global change and Sampath Bank is well positioned to deliver these innovations to our own people. We are committed to growing and following international best practices that will give the best returns to our clients.? ? ?
In evaluating how Sampath Bank?s commitment to innovation contributed to being recognised as the best commercial, as well as best retail bank, Perera states that one of the bank?s key strengths is in imports, which is at the heart of being a commercial bank.?
?In business transactions, speed of turnaround time in providing solutions is essential. For that two things are needed; technological products that can meet the any requirements and, technical superiority of our credit officers and international treasury in creating solutions. On that front we have done well,? Perera reflected.?
Retail banking consists of current accounts, savings accounts, loans and overdraft requirements, and as such, the speed of service delivery is a crucial consideration. In this sector especially, payment methods using cash and cheque are gradually becoming out-dated, and internet and mobile banking products are seeing an exponential growth.?
?ATMs are no longer new but it is still important to track what percentage of payments are ATM driven and how much of products can be mobile driven. In the future these are the aspects that will really be drivers. We had started introducing these products well before other banks and I can confidently say that we have solutions that have been accepted by the public,? affirms Perera. ?Focus on sustainability reporting
Among Sampath Bank?s many previous award recognitions, a special focus has been on sustainability reporting which has differentiated the bank?s initiatives in giving back to its community. ? ?
Commenting on Sampath Bank?s long-term commitment to its Corporate Social Responsibility, the Managing Director says, ?As a bank, we are fully aware of our responsibility to our community, and have a strong background in integrating into and contributing to society. Sampath Bank started our CSR in 1987 with our first ATM card, when a small amount of money from each card would be contributed to our community efforts. We have continued to build on this foundation, and have focused on aspects such as entrepreneur development, education, and the overall wellbeing of our entire society. For example, Sampath Bank has gotten involved in assisting kidney disease patients, and a couple of years ago, we donated a Rs. 50 million neuro-navigator to the General Hospital. Such efforts will only continue.??
Having climbed up the LMD rankings, Sampath Bank has established itself at number seven as a company that is both business savvy and patriotic. Among the many categories evaluated by the LMD magazine when compiling the list of Most Respected Entities, Sampath Bank is placed number one in the segment of ?nation mindedness?, and is also ranked highly in interlinked categories such as ?honesty?.
Perera affirms that the bank will continue to improve on this achievement.Clear commitment
?We at Sampath Bank have a very clear commitment to supporting and driving Sri Lanka?s economic and social growth, and are dedicated to giving our best to all 20 million Sri Lankans.?
We focus on immersing ourselves in their development for we cannot move forward as a nation otherwise. Such accolades as we have received are given to us by the public as an acknowledgement of the sincerity that we have displayed in our corporate culture for 35 years. We have always put Sri Lanka first, working hard to take our nation forward, and we will continue to serve and grow with our beloved country.??
Being at the helm of a bank that is a trailblazer in Sri Lanka?s financial sector, Perera maintains that Sampath Bank?s future goals are concentrated on being an intrinsic part of Sri Lanka?s development and its economic growth by adapting to new technology, and utilising it to provide more complete financial solutions to its customers. ?
?Global finance is evolving in incredibly fast and complex ways. Sri Lanka?s banking sector has the great responsibility of keeping the country connected to the global market place and linking our economy with the rest of the world. To do this we must continue to keep pace with the dynamic changes taking place around us, and use our expertise and knowledge to take Sri Lanka forward. We must respond to the fast changing marketplace and continue to upgrade our services and products to meet new challenges,? he concluded. ??

Is Govt. using Sunny Leone to promote casinos?: Wimal
	
The good-governance proponents, who condemned casinos in the country, should confirm whether they are planning to promote the casino industry by bringing the well-known erotic actress Sunny Leone to the country, National Freedom Front Leader and Opposition MP Wimal Weerawansa said today.
Ms. Leone is said to be planning to visit Sri Lanka in December and during her visit, she is expected to present a musical concert at the premises of a casino in Colombo.
Ms. Leone is reportedly being sponsored by a businessman who has a chain of casinos in Sri Lanka.
Mr. Weerawansa said Ven. Athuraliye Rathana Thera should raise his voice against actress Leone?s visit to the country because he was one of those who spoke against the casinos during the previous government.
?We can?t imagine what will happen to the country at this rate. We saw an organization calling itself the Centre for Sex Worker?s Rights (CSWR) requesting the President to legalise sex workers and provide them legal recognition. There were reports asking for legal rights for gays as well and in the meantime we hear that the well-known erotic actress Sunny Leone is visiting our country to promote casinos. Where are the religious groups and other politicians who protested against casino projects? This concert will definitely help to expand the casino industry. We should not let it happen,? Mr. Weerawansa said. (Piyumi Fonseka)

Avant-Garde raid similar to millennium city affair: Marapana
	
Law and Order Minister Tilak Marapana today told Parliament that the Police had raided the Avant-Garde floating armoury ship at the Galle Harbour soon after the election to 'score point'. While dismissing allegations over the whole matter, the Minister stated that it was similar to the millennium city affair in 2002. ?The reality was that,? he said.
Speaking during an adjournment debate on the company?s dealings in Parliament, minister Marapana said facts have been distorted to create a wrong picture in the minds of the people.
He said the company had only helped the Government to find some lost arms. ?It was Avant-Garde Head Nisssanka Senadipathi had only helped in recovering a portion of lost arms,? the Minister said while mentioning that even the Navy could not manage to recover them in the mid sea.
Mr. Marapana was questioned by several MPs, including TNA MP M. A. Sumanthiran as to how he could speak in Parliament when he was the lawyer retained by Mr. Senadipathi. The Minister who responded said only one side of the story would be recorded if he does not speak on the issue.
Meanwhile, Minister of Justice Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe referring to the allegations made against Attorney General over the Avant-Garde case, also stated that nothing shady had taken place in the case.
Several MPs, including Chief Opposition Whip Anura Kumara Dissanayake alleged that the AG had tried to cover up the case.
Further Mr. Rajapaksa said it was he who prevented the arrest of Former Defence Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa against whom serious allegations had been made. (Yohan Perera)

Sign of an outside force influencing HNDA students
	
	There is evidence to suggest that an outside force had influenced the students of the Higher National Diploma in Accountancy (HNDA) during the protest on October 29, Higher Education Minister Lakshman Kiriella told Parliament yesterday.
	He said there had been some people from Kandy among the students at the protest outside the University Grants Commission Office (UGC).
	The minister said the students were aware that the government had taken steps to reactivate the circular 46/90 on awarding degree status to the HNDA course and pointed out that this could be confirmed in the statement issued by the students' union convener on October 29.
	"It is nothing but a joke for the students to stage a protest when the government had already decided to meet their demands," he said.
	He recalled the crisis was the work of the previous regime which cancelled the degree status of the diploma course.
	A heated argument between the minister and Chief Opposition Whip Anura Dissanayake arose just then when Mr. Dissanayake said the decision to reactivate the circular was made after the students launched their protest campaign. (Yohan Perera)

Deputy Foreign Affairs Minister Harsha de Silva said the Sri Lankan Government under the leadership of President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe had taken several measures to prevent corruption, to seek out stolen assets and to build the capacity for curbing corruption and bribery in an effective, comprehensive and result-oriented manner.
At a high level segment of the Conference of State Parties to the UN Convention against Corruption held in the Russian City of St. Petersburgh, he outlined the independent institutions that have been put in place, especially following the adoption of the 19th Amendment to the Constitution, as well as other investigative mechanisms in line with the mandate received by the Government at both the presidential and parliamentary elections.
?In a country where anti-corruption was only a rhetorical commitment under the previous government, the measures which have now been taken represented a paradigm shift aimed at contributing towards a culture of good governance. The National Unity Government is encouraging civil society and the business sector to assist in combating corruption,? Dr. de Silva said.
Participating in the 6th Session of the Conference hosted by the Russian Government, Dr. de Silva also held several bilateral consultations on the sidelines of the meeting.

Subsidy for Indian fishermen to end bottom trawling in SL
	
Indian Ministry of Agriculture has moved a Rs. 380 crore proposal to provide subsidy for replacing old trawlers of Tamil Nadu fishermen with modern tuna longliners to end bottom trawling fishing in Lankan waters, Business Standard reported.
Ever since India and Sri Lanka signed the maritime agreement in 1974, Tamil Nadu fishermen have run into problems as they have been crossing maritime border for fishing in the Palk Bay and Gulf of Mannar regions using bottom trawling.
The main complaint of Sri Lanka has been against India's bottom trawling method of fishing that severely damaging marine resources and the sea bed, leading to arrest of Tamil Nadu fishermen.
"To mitigate the relentless conflict with Sri Lanka and encourage sustainable fishing, the Agriculture Ministry has moved a cabinet note seeking subsidy support for replacing existing old fishing trawlers in Tamil Nadu with the modern tuna longliners," sources said.
There are 3,000-odd old trawlers in the state. A modern tuna longliner boat above 50 metre length is estimated to cost around Rs 60 lakh. The Tamil Nadu government has requested the centre to bear the 50 per cent of the cost of the boat and sought Rs 950 crore funds for the same.
However, in the cabinet note, sources said the ministry has proposed that the Tamil Nadu fishermen should pay half the price of the boat on their own and the subsidy portion should be borne by both the centre and the state in the 40:60 ratio.
Accordingly, the ministry is seeking release of Rs 380 crore funds for incentivising purchase of modern tuna longliners boats, which will help Tamil Nadu fishermen explore full potential of high seas, sources added.
Bottom trawling is banned in many countries including Sri Lanka. Due to old trawlers, Tamil Nadu fishermen are unable to explore high seas for fishing and therefore go to Lankan waters to get maximum number of catch.

	Front line Socialist Party (FSP) Politburo member Duminda Nagamuwa said today FSP Central Committee member Kumar Gunaratnam, who was engaged in active politics for the last couple of months was arrested due to the influence on the Government after the recent attack at the protest launched by the HNDA students.
	Mr. Nagamuwa said the Government attacked the protest campaigns launched by university students and people who protested for their rights for the last ten months whereas it came to power pledging to ensure student rights.
	?Government attacked the university students" protest on March 31 and protest by the University Bhikku Federation on April 30. It also attacked protests in Kotakethana and Jaffna. The Government?s reaction is clear when peoples? forces are rising against it. People should understand the Government?s repressive reaction to their issues,? he said.
	Mr. Nagamuwa told a news conference that Kumar Gunaratnam was arrested by the previous Government and deported from the country due to various influences by civil society and political parties and that he was brought back to the country after the assurance given by the present Government to ensure democracy in the country where people who left the country due to political reasons could engage in their political activities freely.
	He said however the Government attempted to arrest and deport Mr. Gunaratnam by the end of January and that now it had started its suppressive actions when forces against the Government were rising in the country and it was following the suit of the previous Government and that Gunaratnam was abducted him and the present Government arrested him.
	Mr. Nagamuwa said the people would have to return to the campaign launched by them before January 8 to ensure democracy in the country and added that they would organize a political campaign against the arrest of their leader.
	He said they would consider taking legal action against the arrest as he was arrested without any arrest warrant and searched the house without any search warrant. (Ajith Siriwardana)
