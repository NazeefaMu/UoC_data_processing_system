Electoral reforms by end of year: PM
	
The new electoral system would be enacted end of this year with the support of all political parties, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said today.
Speaking during a ceremony organised by the Department of Elections to mark its 60th Anniversary, the Prime Minister said new electoral system would be in place by the end of this year after reaching an agreement on a proper electoral system.
He said the challenge before the parties today was to decide whether the country should go for a system where the Proportional Representation (PR) and the First Past the Post (FPP) system go parallel with each other or a mixed system as in New Zealand.
He said the government hoped to increase the representation of women in the local bodies to 25 percent from the next local government elections, even by increasing the number of seats in local bodies.
?Some may say there is no time for it but I would like to insist that we should implement this without wasting time,? he said.
Mr. Wickremesinghe said one must also look at the change in the political culture that was brought about by the social media.
He said social media have had such an impact on politics that people had begun to vote for those whom no one ever would think of coming into power.
Citing an example he said that US Democrat Hillary Clinton had met unexpected competition from a fellow party member to become the Presidential candidate.
Mahajana Eksath Peramuna (MEP) Leader Dinesh Gunawardane also highlighted the fact that one must look at the change that was being brought about by the social media.
Mr. Gunawardene made this point by questioning whether the social media would do away with election rallies in the future.? (Yohan Perera)

Lawlessness victimizing the public
There is little doubt that criminal activity in this country has drastically increased in recent months. The underworld has risen once again. And just this year, we have seen an unusual number of rapes, murders and shooting incidents.
While all societies have to deal with some criminal activity, the incidents of recent months have gone to show that our law enforcement does not appear to be as vigilant or properly equipped as it used to be. Two incidents that took place in September alone are cases in point.
The Police have clearly mishandled the recent case of the gruesome rape and murder of the five-year-old child. The initial haphazard arrests that were made appear to have been made without adequate investigation. On the one hand, the teenager who was initially arrested has been further remanded. Meanwhile, another suspect has allegedly confessed to the crime. If the latter is proven to be true, then the life and future of a second innocent child has been completely destroyed.
Commissioner of the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka, Dr. Prathiba Mahanamahewa, has stated that what happened to this teenager was a grave injustice.
?The rights of the 17-year-old boy have been violated by his unjustifiable arrest,? Dr. Mahanamahewa said, speaking to the Daily Mirror. ?Police may arrest people as long as there is sufficient evidence against them. The arrest of the student raises the doubts as to whether he was arrested after due investigation.?
Lanka Teachers? Union Secretary Joseph Stalin had also condemned the police treatment of the suspects in custody as being unacceptable.
?As soon as the suspects were arrested, the Police acted as if the suspects had already been convicted,? Mr. Stalin said. ?One precious life has already (been) lost, and another life is being subjected to Police injustice.? [http://goo.gl/rJ4NWE]
Then there is the shooting incident that occurred inside the premises of the Kaduwela Magistrate Court, which is equally troubling. It goes to show that the Police are unable to maintain law and order even in places where criminals are brought ? places that are supposed to be the most secure.
With heinous crimes on the increase, the Government is still preoccupied with investigating my family. What this clearly shows is that the Government is desperately trying to shift the public?s attention away from the serious challenges this country is now facing.
The question now is why enough resources are not being invested to upgrade our Police service to adequately equip them in handling the serious crimes that are taking place in this country. Is spending public funds to seek personal revenge more important and more justifiable than upholding the safety and justice of Sri Lanka?s public? Sadly, that seems to be the case.

Pressure on media will increase, says N. Ram
	
	Paid news, political pressure and buying of media institutions by powerful companies which have no media background will increase? the pressure on media, a top media personage from India said yesterday.
	Mr. N. Ram, the chairman of Kasturi and Sons Ltd, the Publisher of the Hindu Group of? Newspapers, who gave the keynote address at the Esmond Wickremesinghe Media Freedom awards ceremony, said the exotic world of aggressive and? unorthodox publishing and business strategising for growing newspapers? throws out of the window most of the things learnt from journalism? school or the elements of journalism. He said the situation had?? led to some critical debates on a wider phenomenon ? paid news, not as a? rogue practice but as a deeper and industry-wide phenomenon that was not? confined to election coverage. ?Paid news is run to pass off an? advertisement, a piece of propaganda...as news. Paid? news does not disclose to the reader that this information has been paid? for,? he said.
	He said, the pressure from politicians? and the public to impose external regulation through legislation would? increase. Mr. Ram said demonstrating that? transparency, accountability, and social responsibility are more than? slogans, and introducing codes of values and codes of good practice binding? journalists and the media industry, would help media organisations to overcome this situation. He stressed the need for self-regulatory mechanisms, such as? independent news ombudsmen, within major news organisations. Mr.? Ram lauded Sri Lanka for removing defamation laws, giving the credit to? the government and parliament of 2002. He stressed that the Press Complains Commission should be strengthened by statutory underpinning,? allocation of adequate funds by parliament, and the provision of an? appellate tribunal that would satisfy legal requirements. Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe (the son of Mr. Esmond Wickremesinghe), who was the chief guest at the ceremony, delineated the struggle for media freedom in Sri Lanka relating to the takeover of Lake House by the United Front government in 1973. He said he would leave it to the media to reward those who had stood up for media freedom. ?Neither I nor anyone from my family will interfere in the Esmond Wickremesinghe award scheme; I leave the decisions to the media,? he said. Edmond Ranasinghe, the founding editor of? Divaina stressed that the press should highlight the importance of the change that was brought about on January 8, 2015, and play a role in sustaining it. The inaugural Esmond Wickremesighe award was given to Udayan Newspapers Ltd. (Yohan Perera)

SL judicial system isn?t equipped to probe war crimes: Zeid
	
UN Human Rights Chief Zeid Ra?ad Al Hussein justifying the OISL report recommendation for a hybrid special court to address accountability issues in Sri Lanka, said the domestic judicial system is not equipped to conduct an investigation into the crimes listed in the findings.
Addressing the ongoing 30th UNHRC session a short while ago via a video statement, the High Commissioner pointed out the ?breadth and magnitude? of the crimes documented in the OISL report cannot be probed by local judicial systems and emphasized the need for international participation in the mechanism that is due to be established to address accountability concerns.
He also noted that although the scope for freedom of expression has improved, cases of surveillance have been reported on district levels in the North and East. The High Commissioner also expressed concern over the 19 arrests made under the PTA and 14 cases of torture that have been reported since January 2015.
HC Zeid also called on the government to criminalize hate speech and added that he hopes the recommendations are taken up with due consideration. (Lakna Paranamanna)
The full statement of UN Human Rights Chief:
Mr President, Excellencies,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
I am pleased to present the report of OHCHR on promoting reconciliation, accountability and human rights in Sri Lanka, including the findings of the comprehensive investigation mandated by Human Rights Council resolution 25/1. As you know, following signals of engagement by the newly elected Government of Sri Lanka in January 2015, the Human Rights Council decided to defer consideration of the report until this thirtieth session.
The context in which this report is presented is very different to the one during which it was mandated. The election of a new President and Government on a platform centred on good governance, human rights and the rule of law presents a historic opportunity to address the grave human rights violations that have wracked Sri Lanka, including through accountability and institutional reform, and to lay the basis for long-term reconciliation and peace.
We are also seeing renewed engagement by the new Government with OHCHR and the UN human rights mechanisms. The previous Government categorically rejected the Human Rights Council-mandated investigation and refused access and cooperation. More worryingly, it resorted to an unrelenting campaign of intimidation and harassment against victims, witnesses and representatives of civil society who might seek to provide information to OHCHR.
The new Government did not alter the stance on cooperation with the investigation, nor did it admit the investigation team into the country. However, it has engaged more constructively with me and my Office on possible options for an accountability and reconciliation process.
It also invited the Special Rapporteur on truth, justice, reparations and guarantees of non-recurrence to make a technical visit in March/April 2015, and will host the Working Group on Enforced and Involuntary Disappearances in November 2015. I hope this will mark the start of a closer engagement with the Special Procedures, whose mandates can offer valuable advice and technical assistance.
Mr President,
The Presidential election of 8 January 2015 marked a watershed in the political environment in Sri Lanka. The manifesto of the new Government included a 100-day programme of important constitutional reforms and other important measures. The Chief Justice, who was controversially impeached in January 2013, was briefly reinstated and Parliamentary elections subsequently held on 17 August 2015. Since January 2015 space has significantly opened up for freedom of expression, at least in Colombo.
But surveillance and interference continue to be reported at the district level in the North and East, including harassment and intimidation by military and intelligence services. This demonstrates the pervasiveness of the structures and institutional cultures that created the repressive environment of the past, and highlights the importance of much more fundamental security-sector reforms.
Six years after the end of the war, many displaced populations have yet to achieve durable solutions, particularly with regard to livelihoods. One major continuing problem is the occupation by the military of private land, although the Government has proceeded with some land releases in recent months. Women-headed households, numbering nearly 60,000 in the Northern Province, are especially vulnerable, including to sexual harassment, exploitation and violence.
The Government has yet to clarify the number and identity of detainees still held under the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA) and emergency regulations. Reports have continued to suggest the existence of secret and unacknowledged places of detention. These require urgent investigation. According to local civil society sources, from January to August this year, 19 people were arrested under the PTA. 12 of them remain in detention and 14 cases of torture have been reported to us by credible sources since January 2015. I welcome the Government?s commitment to review and repeal the PTA, which has long provided a legal context facilitating arbitrary detention, unfair trials and torture.
While the past six months have seen an abatement of religious tensions and violence, incidents against Muslim and Christian communities continue to be reported. There have been no prosecutions in relation to the June 2014 attacks by the Buddhist group Bodu Bala Sena on the Muslim community in Aluthgama This highlights the continuing need for the Government to promote inter-communal tolerance and to criminalize hate speech and incitement to violence.
Since January 2015, President Sirisena and other government figures have emphasized reconciliation in public statements. On Independence Day, on 4 February, the Government issued a special ?declaration of peace? in three languages, expressing sympathy and regret for all the victims of the 30-year armed conflict, and pledging to advance ?national reconciliation, justice and equality for all citizens?. The Government also established a new Office of National Unity and Reconciliation, headed by former President Kumaratunga, to drive progress on key issues such as the release of detainees and restitution of civilian land occupied by the military.
In our previous reports to the Human Rights Council, we have described the total failure of domestic mechanisms to conduct credible investigations, clarify the truth of past events, ensure accountability and provide redress to victims.
The Presidential Commission to Investigate into Complaints regarding Missing Persons that was appointed by the previous Government has continued its work, despite widespread concerns raised about its credibility and effectiveness. We believe this Commission should be disbanded and its pending cases transferred to a credible and independent institution established in consultation with families of the disappeared.
Since January there have been a few promising developments in some emblematic cases previously highlighted by OHCHR:
On 25 June a former army staff sergeant was convicted of the murder of eight Tamil civilians in Mirusuvil, Jaffna District, in 2000. This is a rare case of a conflict-related violation being successfully prosecuted, albeit after twelve years.
In March 2015, three navy personnel and a former police officer were arrested in relation to the killing, in November 2006 of parliamentarian Nadarajah Raviraj.
In August 2015, police also announced that they had arrested several military personnel in relation to the disappearance of journalist and cartoonist Prageeth Eknaligoda.
But many other criminal cases languish before the courts, including those concerning the killing of five students on the Trincomalee beachfront in January 2006, and of 17 humanitarian workers for Action Contre la Faim in Muttur in August 2006 also.
Mr President,
The comprehensive investigation presented in this report was undertaken by a special team constituted within OHCHR. I am grateful to the three distinguished experts ? Martti Ahtisaari, Silvia Cartwright, and Asma Jahangir ? who have played a supportive and advisory role in this process. Special procedure mandate holders also provided input to the investigation.
The aim of the investigation was to identify the patterns of violations of international human rights and humanitarian law, not only during the final stage of the armed conflict but during the whole nine year period covered by its mandate. The timeframe covered by the investigation, the extent of the violations, the amount of information available, and the constraints to the investigation, including lack of access to Sri Lanka and witness protection concerns, posed enormous challenges.
The investigation found that there are reasonable grounds to believe that gross violations of international human rights law and serious violations of international humanitarian law were committed by all parties during the period under review. Indeed, if established before a court of law, many of the allegations may amount to war crimes, and/or crimes against humanity.
These findings are detailed in the accompanying 250-page investigation report, and I will highlight only key elements today:
We found reasonable grounds to believe the Sri Lankan security forces and paramilitary groups associated with them were implicated in widespread and unlawful killings of civilians and other protected persons. Tamil politicians, humanitarian workers and journalists were particularly targeted. The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) also unlawfully killed civilians perceived to hold sympathies contrary to the LTTE, or suspected as informers, as well as rival Tamil political figures, public officials and academics. Civilians were also killed or injured in indiscriminate suicide bombings and claymore mine attacks carried out by LTTE.
We also investigated allegations of extrajudicial executions of identified LTTE cadres and unidentified individuals in or around 18 May 2009, and established in several cases that they appear to have been killed after surrendering to the Sri Lankan military.
We documented long-standing patterns of arbitrary arrest and detention by government security forces, and of abductions by paramilitary organizations linked to them, typically in unmarked ?white vans?, which often reportedly led to enforced disappearances and extrajudicial killings.
We also documented the widespread torture by the Sri Lankan security forces, particularly in the immediate aftermath of the armed conflict, when former LTTE members and civilians were detained en masse.
A particularly shocking finding is the widespread use of rape and other forms of sexual violence by security forces personnel against both male and female detainees.
We gathered information that reflected a pattern of abductions and of forced recruitment of adults by LTTE that became more prevalent towards the end of the conflict. The forced recruits were obliged to perform both military and support functions and were often denied contact with their families. Victims and families who tried to resist were physically mistreated, harassed and threatened.
We also documented extensive recruitment and use of children (including under the age of 15) by the LTTE over many years, which intensified during the last few months of the conflict. We gathered information on child recruitment by the Karuna Group after its split from the LTTE in 2004, with the apparent knowledge of the security forces.
Mr President,
We examined closely the impact of hostilities on civilians and civilian objects during the last months of the war. On the basis of the information available, there are reasonable grounds to believe that both the Government and LTTE failed to comply with key principles of international humanitarian law on the conduct of hostilities designed to protect civilians.
In particular, the report documents repeated shelling by Government forces impacting on hospitals and humanitarian facilities in the densely populated ?No Fire Zones? which the Government itself had announced. The presence of LTTE cadres directly participating in hostilities and operating within the predominantly civilian population, launching attacks from close proximity to these locations, and the LTTE policy of forcing civilians to remain within areas of active hostilities, may also have violated international humanitarian law.
Our investigation also found that the Government placed considerable restrictions on humanitarian access, and may have deliberately blocked the delivery of sufficient food aid and medical supplies, essential to the survival of the civilian population. This may amount to the use of starvation of civilians as a method of warfare.
We also examined the manner in which screening processes were carried out at the end of the war to separate former LTTE combatants from civilians. Almost 300,000 IDPs were deprived of their liberty in camps for periods far beyond what is permissible under international law. There are also reasonable grounds to believe that IDPs were treated as suspects and detained because of their Tamil ethnicity, which may amount to discrimination and to the crime against humanity of ?persecution.?
Mr President,
The sheer number of allegations, their gravity and recurrence and the similarities in their modus operandi, as well as the consistent pattern of conduct they indicate, all point to system crimes. Such acts cannot be treated as ordinary crimes: if established in a court of law, they may constitute international crimes, which are of interest to the international community.
I welcome the Government?s commitments, made before this Council, to investigate these violations and ensure accountability, despite the opposition of some political parties and sections of the military and society. The unfortunate reality is, however, that Sri Lanka?s criminal justice system is not currently equipped to conduct an independent and credible investigation into allegations of this breadth and magnitude, or to hold accountable those responsible for such violations, as requested by the Council in resolution 25/1.
First, Sri Lanka lacks a reliable system for victim and witness protection, particularly in a context where the risk of reprisals is very high. A long-pending law was recently passed, but it is not yet operational. I note the Government?s commitment to further review and strengthen the law to address various shortcomings that could compromise the independence and effectiveness of the new system.
Secondly, the domestic legal framework is inadequate to deal with international crimes of this magnitude. When Sri Lanka has prosecuted conflict-related cases, it has relied on offences in regular criminal law, such as murder. This approach fails to recognize the gravity of the crimes committed, their international character, or to duly acknowledge the harm caused to the victims. To fully reflect their gravity and bring redress to their victims, international crimes must be charged as such.
Thirdly, the State?s security sector and justice system have been distorted and corrupted by decades of impunity. The independence and integrity of key institutions such as the Attorney General?s Office and the Human Rights Commission remain compromised. The security forces, police and intelligence services have enjoyed near total impunity and have not undergone any significant reform since the armed conflict. A full-fledged vetting process should be designed to remove from office security forces personnel and public officials suspected of involvement in human rights violations.
This is why I have recommended the establishment of an ad hoc hybrid special court, integrating international judges, prosecutors, lawyers and investigators, mandated to try notably war crimes and crimes against humanity, with its own independent investigative and prosecuting organ, defence office and witness and victims protections programme. In a highly polarized environment, such a mechanism is essential to give all Sri Lankans, especially victims, confidence in the independence and impartiality of this process.
Judicial accountability should be accompanied by broader transitional justice measures, including truth-seeking and reparations, to ensure that the right of victims to redress is realized. These must be designed through a process of genuine, informed and participatory consultation, especially with victims and their families, and OHCHR stands ready to lend its assistance in this regard.
Mr President,
This is a time of tremendous hope. Sri Lanka can finally break the cycle of impunity that for so long wracked its past. This will require more than prosecuting a few emblematic cases, but rather a comprehensive approach, developed through a broad-based and victim-centred process of consultation, that draws on the full range of transitional justice measures of judicial accountability, truth-seeking, reparations, vetting and deep institutional reform.
I hope the recommendations made in our report will make an important contribution to this process, and emphasise OHCHR's readiness to continue to assist and support the development of credible accountability and transitional justice mechanisms that meet international standards. The Human Rights Council has played ? and should continue to play ? a critical role in encouraging progress on accountability and reconciliation in Sri Lanka.
I thank you Mr. President.

An investigations team from Sri Lanka will travel to neigbouring Maldives to assist in the ongoing investigation into the explosion aboard the presidential speedboat carrying President Abdulla Yameen Abdul Gayoom and the First Lady on Monday morning, Haveeru Online reported.
Already five Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) officials from US were in the Maldives assisting the investigation, it said quoting a Maldivian Police spokesperson. ?A team from neighbouring Sri Lanka and India were also set to arrive in the Maldives for the investigation.
In addition to the FBI agents, a nine-member forensic team from Saudi Arabia were also assisting with the investigation,? the Male based Haveeru Online said.
The Presidential delegation returned home Monday morning after concluding their visit to Saudi Arabia to perform the annual hajj pilgrimage.
The president was unhurt, but the first lady suffered a spinal fracture while presidential secretary Fathimath Mohamed Solih and bodyguard Abdu Nasir also suffered minor injuries including burns. They were still being treated at the state run Indira Gandhi Memorial Hospital (IGMH).
The Maldivian Government on Wednesday had suggested that Monday's explosion was likely a targeted attack, a claim that contradicts earlier accounts given by a top administration official.

	?At the time of the Presidential Election period the UPFA had less than 10,000 Rupees on its account. How can we pay Rs. 104 million from that account balance? The responsibility had to be taken by the committee,? he said.
	?I do not know anything about the advertising firms, which had worked on the election propaganda, or how they raised money for the election, and don?t know to whom they paid to,? he said.
	?I have been holding UPFA General Secretary post for eleven years but I have not done any work in the election committees and that is not relevant to me,? the Minister said. (Chaturanga Pradeep)

Video: We must deal honestly with the past: MS at UN
	
	President Maithripala Sirisena addressing the 70th Session of the United Nations General Assembly in New York today, said that a fundamental requirement to achieve his government's main vision -- sustainable development and reconciliation -- was to deal with the past honestly and build a modern nation: and that in dealing with the past, Sri Lanka would use a process of truth seeking, justice, reparation and non-recurrence.
	President Maithripala Sirisena addressing the 70th Session of the United Nations General Assembly in New York yesterday, said that a fundamental requirement to achieve his government's main vision -- sustainable development and reconciliation -- was to deal with the past honestly and build a modern nation: and that in dealing with the past, Sri Lanka would use a process of truth seeking, justice, reparation and non-recurrence.
	?It is imperative that Sri Lanka adopts a new social, economic and political approach to rise up to the challenges of the 21st century. In this regard, reconciliation receives priority attention in my country. The new consensual government under my leadership has already taken several steps to introduce and operationalize constitutional and institutional reforms required to accelerate the achievement of these goals,? he said.
	Addressing the world leaders in Sinhala, the president said, ?Sri Lanka is a country that has suffered from conflict. While conflict brings destruction to a society, there are also many lessons that could be learnt during and after a conflict.
	?We defeated one of the world?s most ruthless terror outfits. Equally, our post conflict experiences also have been significant. We believe that all these experiences can be shared fruitfully with other developing countries affected by terrorism. Sri Lanka remains prepared to engage in a more active dialogue with these countries and will continue to speak and advocate against terrorism."
	Speaking further he said, ?I believe that for global development, it is important to have a dialogue within the South as much as between the North and South. My country that represents the South can contribute immensely to nurture such North-South dialogue.
	?My understanding of sustainable development is not to have isolated sector or group-wise development, but to have an inclusive model of development that is capable of raising standards globally. For this purpose, I stress on the need for a fresh universal approach.?
	Commenting on the sustainable development, the Sri Lankan president said that the edifice of sustainable development should be built upon the foundation of self-discipline and equity. ?If this could be practised at the personal, community, national and global level, it would mark a giant leap forward for humanity.
	?I propose that we, as national leaders, take cognizance of this self-discipline and equity-based approach when drawing relevant Action Plans for the future.
	?Sri Lanka is a nation that respects the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations, and international conventions and treaties. A major objective of the UN is to recognize, safeguard and promote human rights. Sri Lanka remains committed to fulfil this responsibility. In this respect, we intend implementing a new programme and plan of action in Sri Lanka to advance human rights.?
