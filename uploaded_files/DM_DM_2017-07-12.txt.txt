A dissident in the dissident group
	

The yahapalanaya ginger group that has vowed to quit their portfolios and go independent had reportedly held a powwow at the VIP lounge of a high-end hotel in Rajagiriya.

Although there were 18 invitees, only 12 had turned up for the powwow. And there had been both purohitas and ordinary members among those present, they say.
The participants had reached agreement on a series of collective measures to be taken during the lengthy discussion on their Post- August agenda that ensued.
However, a deputy in the dissident group, a well- known business tycoon, hailing from a district north of the hill capital, had suddenly struck a discordant note by suggesting that they give another chance to the Green-Blue marriage.
However, all other diehards in the group had flatly rejected his suggestion. Of course, it had been quite obvious to them that the deputy was having second thoughts prompted by the need to save his own skin given several court cases he was facing these days.

A new building to dispel malefic influences!
	

An upcountry political leader who is reportedly highly put out over loss of political authority has been told by astrologers that a Vastu Dosha of the building in which his political office is housed is the cause for the downswing in his political fortunes.



Now this political leader is said to be planning to demolish his political office at Flower Road in the city with a view to putting up a 35-storied building on the site on the advice of Vastu Vidya experts from the neighboring country.
The politico is said to have been assured by occultists that all malefic influences affecting him now will get nullified when the construction work on the new building gets underway at an auspicious time. Meanwhile, the politico looks forward to rake in a good income from giving on rent the floor space of the multi-story building due to come up.
The income from this building alone will suffice to meet all costs of running our party, he has told his party faithfuls.

ACS closed to save corrupt politicos of both side: JVP
	
The Anti-Corruption Secretariat (ACS) was to be closed down to save the Corrupted Ministers in both the present regime and the previous Government, the Janatha Vimkuthi Peramuna (JVP) charged today.
JVP MP Vijitha Herath told a media briefing today that there were allegations against both the UNP and SLFP Ministers.
There are allegations against the newly appointed Governor of Eastern Province Rohitha Bogollagama, against Minister Ravi Karunanayake, against Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam on some illegal appointments, Ministers S. B. Dissanayake, Nimal Siripala de Silva, Rajitha Senaratne and others, MP Herath said.
There are allegations against former Ministers Wimal Weerawansa, Basil Rajapaksa, Namal Rajapaksa and a host of others. Some of them had travelled abroad and had not settled the dues.
However, they have paid a total sum of Rs. 16 million, when the investigations were going on, he added.
Further the MP charged that there may be plans to close the Financial Crimes Division (FCID) as well.
He said institutions involved in eradicating corruption had received 441 complaints on serious financial crimes during the last two-and-a-half years and 547 complaints on abuse of public property.
Out of the 441 serious financial crimes, 258 frauds are investigated by the FCID, 43 by CID 148 by the Bribery Commission.
The statement made by the President and Minister Rajitha Senaratne that ACS was a wastage of funds cannot be accepted, considering the number of complaints, he said. (Yohan Perera)

Allianz Lanka delivers greater  returns to policyholders
	
Allianz Life Insurance Lanka (Allianz Lanka) registered steady growth in returns to policyholders on its investment linked life insurance policies which delivered dividends of 8.5 percent for the financial year 2016 (FY 2016).
Based on the life fund earnings attributable to each policy, the dividends are credited to the applicable policy where they accrue further returns on a compounding basis. The Insurer had declared dividends of 7.9 percent in FY 2014 and 8 percent in FY 2015.
Thanking our policyholders for placing their trust in Allianz Lanka, it gives me great pleasure to note that we have declared dividends of 8.5 percent for FY 2016. The steady growth in returns is a reflection of our strong fundamentals as well as our prudent investment strategy, said Surekha Alles, Chief Executive Officer - Allianz Lanka.
We look forward to delivering greater value to all our stakeholders as we continue to strengthen our position as one of the strongest insurers in the market.
Allianz Lanka offers three investment-linked life policies that provide a life cover as well a return on the sum invested along with a host of benefits and privileges. Universal Life Family provides returns on investment to take care of the policyholders familys goals together with a life cover to help them meet unplanned events.
Offering greater flexibility, Allianz Vishrama Suwa permits policyholders to receive retirement benefits either as a one-time lump sum payment or as a set of scheduled payments over a period of 5, 10, or 15 years. It allows offers flexible premium paying terms and the ability to grow the retirement fund through top-up premiums.
Providing policy benefits until the age of 70, Allianz Power Link gives policyholders control over how their money is invested and also allows them to pick from a range of convenient premium payment options.
Allianzs Arogya critical illness plan has the distinction of being the only policy in the country that provides payouts for both critical illnesses and accidents at 3 different stages. While traditional critical illness covers offer payouts only once when the illness occurs, Allianz makes lump sum payouts at early, major and critical stages of an illness or accident with Arogya. This is aimed at helping policyholders get the necessary treatment right from the early stages and to facilitate early recovery. Allianz Lanka waives off all future premium payments for the remaining duration of the policy once a major stage claim is made. Policyholders also receive the total sum remaining in their investment account if and when their illness progresses to major and critical stages. The policy also covers children affected with critical illnesses, a feature that is not offered by any other insurer in the market.

Amnesty calls for commission to probe  Mosul crimes
	

Amnesty International on Tuesday called for a commission to investigate crimes against civilians in Mosul by all sides in the battle to liberate the Iraqi cityfrom jihadists. 
The horrors that the people of Mosul have witnessed and the disregard for human life by all parties to this conflict must not go unpunished, said Lynn Maalouf, director of Middle East research at Amnesty International.  An independent commission must immediately be established, tasked with ensuring that any instances where there is credible evidence that violations of international law took place, effective investigations are carried out, and the findings made public, she added in a statement. 
Iraq on Sunday declared it had successfully ousted the Islamic State (IS) group from Mosul, from where the jihadists had declared their self-styled caliphate in 2014. In documenting the conflict between January and mid-May, Amnesty found IS violated international humanitarian law and committed war crimes.

An envoy representing one of the powerful countries in the world today had occasion to have a one-on-one friendly chat with a talkative Blue party purohita the other day.

The envoy had taken advantage of this meeting to convey a message to the yahapalanaya. The message had run as follows: Now your government is getting too closer to that red country. You have to keep them at arms length We have told this to your government before. But our word does not appear to have carried any weight. We will be compelled to take some action if your government continues to ignore our advice. Even your Big Brother at the next door is watching the situation. So be on your guard
The purohita after giving a patient hearing to the envoy had reportedly asked him to convey this warning to a Green party high-up whom he mentioned by name.

Brass cast: Samadhi Buddha Statue at Viharamahadevi Park
	
Forty-five years on, Aloy Jayawardene being a Roman Catholic, heeded the request of sculptor Ven. Dr. Mapalagama Vipulasara Thera to brass cast a Buddha Statue to be placed at the Viharamahadevi Park in 1972 to commemorate the Republic Day of Sri Lanka. He presented a replica of it to President Maithripala Sirisena at his office to commemorate the 45th anniversary of its installation. The brass cast 15-foot statue which is the largest brass cast Samadhi Buddha Statue in Sri Lanka sits at the entrance to the Viharamahadevi Park. 
The priest created a mould in concrete and 58 pieces of same were given to Mr. Jayawardene to do the brass casting. The method to do this was by wax casting which Mr. Jayawardene studied prior to its production. A distinguished gathering at the unveiling of the Statue included President William Gopallawa and Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike. Subsequently, Mr. Jayawardene was selected for the Leaders Invitation Programme of the Government of Japan in October 1972. This programme was offered to Mr. Jayawardene by the Prime Minister for having undertaken to do the Buddha Statue, being a Catholic.
Mr. Jayawardene, President Emeritus of Sri Lanka Chamber of Small and Medium Industries, says the Late Venerable Dr. Mapalagama Vipulasara Thera was extremely proud of him because he did a great job being a Roman Catholic.

A replica of the Brass Samadhi Buddha Statue at Viharamahadevi Park was presented to President Maithripala Sirisena to mark the 45th anniversary of its installation. The 15-foot Statue, which is the largest Brass Cast Buddha Statue in Sri Lanka, was manufactured by Mr. Aloy Jayawardene (President Emeritus, Sri Lanka Chamber of Small and Medium Industries) at his factory, Metalrich in Wattala and installed on May 26, 1972.

Co-existence turning sour
	

A senior purohita in the top team had given a jolt to the heads of financial establishments and other statutory bodies coming under the purview of his Ministry when he exhorted them not to heed any summons from their state purohita adding that there was need for them to call on him regarding any official matter either.

The purohita had told these high-ups: Remember he is just a nominal one. None of the Ministry subjects has been assigned to him by the Gazette notification. Therefore, meeting him on any official matter would serve no purpose. He had added in a sterner tone: I am your appointing authority and I did appoint you all. You have to carry out only my instructions!
Thereafter, these heads of state establishments under the Ministry had sought some clarifications. And the purohita in response had repeated his orders and asserted that he would not tolerate any failure on their part in carrying out his instructions.
While discussing the purohitas instructions later, one corporation head had told the others jokingly: Remember if any of us is caught meeting the state one even by accident hereafter, it would be better for him to take a plunge down from this floor of the World Trade Centre than face the consequences!
They also had recalled that the state purohita was not provided with office space to run his office for several weeks after the swearing-in.
One of the corporation heads who attended the meeting with the purohita in the top team had later conveyed to the state one all that transpired at the meeting, they say.

It is essential to conserve the Dambulla Rajamaha Viharaya also known as the Cave Temple Complex if the historic site is to retain its world heritage status, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe told a group of young Buddhist monks who met him at Temple Trees today.
The Government is prepared to stop the conservation work if the Maha Naya Theras want it stopped. However, it is up to the Maha Nayakas to decide the fate of this historical site. It is unfortunate if the Cave Temple Complex is to lose this status at a time UNESCO is considering the declaration of several other Sri Lankan sites including Horton Plains as world heritage sites, he said and added that he would meet the Asgiriya Maha Nayake Thera next week to explain these matters to him.
The Premier said some people were trying to politicize this issue targeting the next election and accused the media of giving prominence to stories such as this when there were a host of other important issues to talk about.
The media never gave publicity when the previous government threatened the Ven. Maha Nayaka Thera of the Malwathu Chapter saying Chapter would be divided. I wonder whether it was Rajapaksa Saranag Gachami for the media at that time, he said and added that the government was willing to talk to the Maha Nayaka Theras, UNESCO and other parties to resolve this matter.

Dengue vaccines only after more research: Official
	
In-depth research needs to be carried out before introducing dengue vaccines including the newly proposed vaccine which is to be introduced in Sri Lanka by the pharmaceutical company known as Sanofi Pasteur, Dengue Eradication Units Community Specialist Dr. Priscilla Samaraweera said today.
She said this particular vaccine had several minor issues when it was in the process of being introduced earlier in Sri Lanka.
Meanwhile, the GMOA told Daily Mirror that according to reports a trial session had been carried out recently in the Puttalam District in an effort to introduce this dengue vaccine in Sri Lanka.
GMOA Secretary Haritha Aluthge said this particular company needed to get the approval of the Epidemiology Unit and the National Medicines Regulatory Authority (NMRA) to introduce such a vaccine.
Introduction of this vaccine to Sri Lanka should be carried out on a scientific basis. It is also necessary to consider the results of the trial sessions before it is approved, he said.
However, our sister paper, the Daily FT recently reported that Sanofi Pasteur was to introduce its dengue vaccine in Sri Lanka and was awaiting Health Ministry approval for use in Sri Lanka.
A company spokesman said Sanofi Pasteur had introduced this vaccine successfully in 17 countries including Singapore, Thailand, Philippines, Brazil and Mexico.
Sanofi Pasteur is cooperating fully and in a transparent manner with the regulatory authorities to find the best solution to the health issues faced by Sri Lankans and help bring down the human suffering and the burden on the country, he said. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)

And wildlife faces further biological annihilation if measures are not taken within the next 20 years to arrest powerful assaults on biodiversity, researchers said. 
Human overpopulation and greed are driving factors behind the destruction of species on Earth, which is having a negative impact on ecosystems, according to researchers.The grim warning, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences journal, states that the hidden rate of species population decreases mean Earths sixth mass extinction episode has proceeded further than most assume. 
The report, involving scientists at both Stanford and Mexico City universities, found the current rate of vertebrate extinction during the last century was two species a year.

Even if offered, MR should reject SLFP nomination: GL
	
Former president Mahinda Rajapaksa should reject nominations of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) even if he was offered to contest at future elections from that party, Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) Chairman G.L. Peiris said yesterday.
He made this remark in a response to the SLFP General Secretary Minister Duminda Dissanayakes statement that the SLFP would no longer offer nomination to Mr. Rajapaksa.
My personal view is that even if Mr. Rajapaksa is offered SLFP nominations, he should reject them in a heartbeat because the SLFP based at Darley Road has become a tool of the United National Party (UNP) today. The SLFP at Darley Road no longer follows its founding values and principles, Prof. Peiris told a news conference.
He said the SLFP-UNP coalition government had failed to come up with solutions to the plight of the people and that in a way the government was attempting to distract the people to get its sinister moves implemented.
With the Dengue menace, strikes and the SAITM issue, the government is attempting to divert the attention of the public so it can pave the way for dangerous plans such as the implementation of the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance, he said.
Sri Lanka signed the Convention in December 2015 and ratified it in March 2016. Prof. Peiris said most of the countries such as the US, UK and Australia had not signed the convention and countries like India or Scandinavian countries are yet to ratify the convention though they have signed it.
The countries are reluctant to sign or ratify this convention in an attempt to save armed personnel and officials of these countries. However, Sri Lankan government had gone out of its way to sign and ratify this convention, he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Gastritis An internal inferno  that devours from within
	

Burning sensation in your tummy Nauseous Loss of appetite Well, stakes are high on the fact that you are suffering from gastritis. Our health takes a back seat in our race against time to keep up with the busy schedules that dictate over us every day. Gastritis is quite a trending condition with so many people falling victim to it, sometimes without a hint of warning. So if you havent fallen victim yet, you are most likely to be next. So it is quite essential to be aware and take necessary steps to prevent from falling into the clutches of this fiery menace we call gastritis. To do this, clear comprehension of this medical complication is necessary.Speaking to the Health Capsule, Dr. Prasad Siriwardana, Consultant Physician of the District General Hospital, Ampara, provides answers to the common public demanding questions that revolve around gastritis. 
Definition
Gastritis is the inflammation of the inner lining of the stomach which is known as the mucous membrane. Some people have gastritis that comes on suddenly and lasts only for a short time. Doctors call this acute gastritis. Other people have gastritis that lasts for months or years. Doctors call this chronic gastritis. 

The most common telltale sign of gastritis is the burning sensation that flares up in the stomach when in hunger and even after having meals

Causes 
It was of common belief that not taking your meals on time was one of the main reasons to get gastritis. But that bubble has burst with research proving this forever standing perception to be untrue. However, irregular intake of meals can aggravate the condition of gastritis once it is contracted. 
According to Dr. Siriwardana, certain types of drugs known as anti-inflammatory drugs are known to cause gastritis. Medicines called non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can cause gastritis. These include aspirin and ibuprofen. These drugs are used as painkillers in the medication for joint ache. Steroids too cause gastritis by inhibiting the action of prostaglandins in the body and thereby reducing the thickness of the mucous membrane making it more vulnerable to injury.They also increase the secretion of gastric juice in the stomach. 
Regular consumption of oily and spicy food can also cause gastritis as these types of food stimulate the acid secretary cells in the stomach. Dr. Siriwardana also mentioned that new developments have revealed that gastritis can also occur as a result of a food allergy. 
Another major and common reason for gastritis is due to the infection of the bacteria Helicobacter pylori residing in the region of the stomach known as the antrum. These bacteria attack the protective lining of the stomach.Their mode of transmission is orally through contaminated food. 
Mental stress, heavy alcohol consumption, conditions in which the bodys infection-fighting system attacks the stomach lining and having a serious or life-threatening illness are some other causes that erupt gastritis into your system. The condition known as bile reflux is known to cause chronic gastritis which is a serious issue. Bile reflux is a medical complication where the backflow of bile takes place into the stomach from the bile tract. This condition demands for immediate professional treatment by a physician. 

Neglected gastritis left untreated could develop to a worse state leading to the formation of gastric ulcers

How can I tell if I am a patient 
Patients with gastritis have no symptoms. When people do display symptoms they are usually due to other disease conditions like ulcers. Dr. Siriwardana stated some of the signs that are generally observed in patients with ulcers. The most common telltale sign of gastritis is the burning sensation that flares up in the stomach when in hunger and even after having meals. Bloating of the stomach after eating a small amount of food, decreased appetite, nausea or vomiting, vomiting blood, feeling more tired than usual (This happens if people with gastritis get a condition called anemia.) are some of the symptoms of gastritis. 
How its diagnosed 
When it comes to clinical diagnosis, physicians arrive at a conclusion by speaking to the patients on the symptoms that they have been experiencing and recommend appropriate medication after conducting examinations. Patients are advised to seek medical help when they have a belly pain that gets worse or doesnt go away, vomit blood or lose weight without trying to. Several tests are performed to diagnose gastritis. Dr. Siriwardana explained that in certain cases an upper endoscopy test will be recommended. In an upper endoscopic test, a thin tube containing a tiny camera will be inserted through the patients mouth down into the stomach where the stomach lining will be viewed. A tiny sample of tissue may also be removed from the stomach lining (known as biopsy) and analyzed. Tests to check for H. pylori infection include blood tests, breath tests, tests on a small sample of your bowel movement, and a barium swallow. Blood tests are also conducted to check for anemia. 
Is complete cure possible 
Gastritis can be cured. If contraction of gastritis is found to be caused due to anti-inflammatory drugs, doctors prescribe alternative drugs that wouldnt induce gastritis or doctors might prescribe supplementary medicine along with the anti-inflammatory drugs to suppress gastritis. Doctors can use medicines that reduce or block stomach acid to treat other causes of gastritis. The main types of medicines that reduce or block stomach acid are antacid agents, histamine blockers and proton pump inhibitors. Patients are also asked to reduce oily and spicy foods. If the bacteria Helicobacter pylori is the reason for gastritis, patients are given special antibiotics to cure the condition. 
However, Dr. Siriwardana stressed that gastritis, caused due to bacteria, is very common. Sometimes such cases arent cured 100% as a patient can get reinfected quite easily. Sometimes, people who are treated for an H. pylori infection need follow-up tests to make sure the infection is healed. Follow-up tests include breath tests, lab tests on a sample of bowel movement, or endoscopy. To prevent the aggravation of gastritis further, regular partaking of meals is also advised so it is vital to adhere to regularized food habits. Alcohol consumers will be asked to avoid alcohol intake. 
How to not be a victim 
Following healthy and hygienic food habits is the main step towards avoiding crossing paths with gastritis. Reducing the intake of oily and spicy foods is a must. Preparing and consuming food under hygienic conditions is important as well. Regardless of speculations, its a healthy habit to take meals on time, making it a regular practice. Saying no to alcohol and keeping your mental health intact without being overcome with stress are definite pointers to keep in mind. Yoga and meditation are strongly advised practices in maintaining a calm composure, free of stress. 
Is it fatal 
Dr. Siriwardana mentioned that gastritis is not fatal. But neglected gastritis left untreated could develop to a worse state leading to the formation of gastric ulcers. Gastric ulcers can be fatal as they cause severe loss of blood, so it is advised to get treatment without delay to prevent this condition. 
How common is it 
According to the physician, gastritis is quite common.About 60-70% of the population suffer from this disease condition. There is no particular age group which highlights more victims. Gastritis is easily contracted by anyone and everyone from all ages, young and old alike. However, the elderly who are above the age of 60 years show more vulnerability to the disease due to weakened resistance with age. The tendency towards the elderly to contract more diseases is high and use of certain drugs could cause the arousal of gastritis in them.

Govt. lying about convention on enforced disappearances: JO
	
The government is lying when it says that the Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearances would not have a retrospective effect, the joint opposition said today.
Former MP G.L. Peiris told the weekly news conference that the convention would not only permit action to be taken against personnel accused of future incidents of enforced disappearances but also on past incidents.
The convention can and will be used to take action against armed personnel who fought terrorists during the final phase of the war in 2009. This piece of legislation will allow the arrest of Sri Lankans when they visit a foreign country. Sri Lanka is also bound to extradite a person against whom a foreign country makes allegations, he said.
Mr. Peiris claimed that Sri Lankans would be arrested and extradited based on a mere accusation made by foreign countries and not on gathered evidence. The arrested Sri Lankans could be tried at international courts such as the International Criminal Court based on the allegations, Mr. Peiris said.
He said western countries including the US, Britain and Canada had not signed the convention whereas Scandinavian countries including Finland, Norway, Sweden and India had not ratified it though they had signed the convention.
Meanwhile, JO leader and MP, Dinesh Gunawardane said the convention would create a harmful environment for former president Mahinda Rajapaksa, former defence secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa and the security forces personnel who defeated terrorism. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Handling workplace stress
	


Everyone experiences stress in their lives, and at times it becomes unmanageable. Work stress is far more dangerous than the other stresses in life. A considerable degree of work stress is essential to perform well and too much of it is so harmful that it could lead to depression and many other mental and physical diseases. 
Stress is mental and physical unrest. Stress is how you respond to challenges in everyday life. It affects people in numerous ways. The Oxford dictionary defines stress as A state of mental or emotional strain or tension resulting from adverse or demanding circumstances. 


Productivity
Excessive stress in the workplace can interfere with performance and productivity while impacting on physical and emotional health. If job stress interferes with the ability to work, care for oneself and manage relationships, then it has reached the bad level. 

Doing a healthy job 
A healthy job is likely to be one where the pressures on employees are appropriate in relation to their abilities and resources, to the amount of control they have over their work, and to the support they receive from people who matter to them. As health isnt merely the absence of disease or infirmity, but a positive state of complete physical, mental and social well-being (WHO, 1986), a healthy working environment isnt one in which there is only an absence of harmful conditions, but also an abundance of health-promoting ones. 
Work-related stress is the response people may suffer when presented with work demands and pressures that dont match their knowledge and abilities,which also challenges their ability to cope. 
Stress occurs in a wide range of work circumstances, but is often made worse when employees feel they have little support from supervisors and colleagues, as well as little control over work processes. 
There is often confusion between pressure or challenge and stress and sometimes its used to excuse bad management practice. 
(World Health Organization)

Unrealistic goals
Working long hours or overtime, taking work home, working too hard or too fast and having unrealistic goals can cause stress. 
Dull and monotonous work and work that isnt related to the training, previous experiences or the studied field, too many responsibilities or insufficient support from supervisors or co - workers, lack of role clarity and poor communication, insecurity of employment and bullying can also be causes for stress.

Discrimination
Most of the stress coming from the workplace is time-bound because people are doing a number of tasks within an insufficient period of time. In such work places people have multiple roles to play. A working man can be a driver, a father, a business partner, a teacher and an active member of certain associations. A mother is bound to her family while caring for the elderly, taking children to the school etc. Most of these time -bound tasks are causing mental and physical unrest. 

Positive factors
Stress isnt innately bad. At times its necessary to maintain focus. If stress focuses someone on deadlines for the fear of failing, thats a form of good stress. Being under pressure or challenged often improves performance. A little bit of stress can help in staying focused, energetic and meeting new challenges in the workplace. When stress exceeds the ability to cope with, it starts damaging mind and body. 
When the pressure and demands are excessive they lead to distress. Therefore, people have to find a comfortable mid-point when dealing with stress, a balance between good and bad. People seem lazy and lethargic when they dont have enough stress motivating them to work. Ultimately, stress relief depends on understanding the philosophies of life. 
To eliminate the stress, one has to find which part is the most stressful in their job and find a solution. Postponing things at the workplace is a big stress builder, faced by many. There are no formulas for relieving stress though. Yet one can practise meditation, exercise, hobbies, leisure activities etc. And sometimes people are stressed for not being organized in life. When life goes through its ups and downs, stress is a natural thing to occur. But it becomes a threat, only if it cannot be managed by the person suffering from it.

## Title: Is there numbness and tingling in your fingers

Is there numbness and tingling in your fingers
	


Numbness in hands is a common complaint encountered by the primary care physicians worldwide. The most frequent cause for numbness and tingling of the hand is the Carpal Tunnel Syndrome (CTS). But how relevant is this topic to you 
Does your occupation involve frequent forceful repetitive hand motions or vibrating hand held tools Are you a gardening enthusiast, preferring to labour over the plants whenever you can Do you have numbness in one or both of your hands Or are you simply interested in knowing about another interesting medical condition Read on to find out more. 

Forearm and hand muscles 
Carpal tunnel is a cave-like structure in our wrist leading from the forearm to the hand. The floor of the tunnel is the wrist (carpal) bones and the roof comprises fibrous tissue called the transverse carpal ligament. This structure contains nine tendons of the hand muscles and the median nerve, an important nerve which contributes to both feelings and movements of the hand. 
With all these structures contained inside an enclosed structure, the space inside the tunnel is pretty cramped. Therefore in instances where the inside pressure is increased, eg: due to fluid collection, the median nerve gets compressed, causing the symptoms to appear overtime. 

At work 
Minimize repetitive movements. Take small breaks at least hourly. Use this time to rest or shake your hands. Gently massage the wrists. 
	Correct posture in the torso and hands is important. 
	In activities involving wrist movements, keep the wrists straight and let your shoulders bear part of the weight 
	Avoid tobacco and caffeinated drinks. 
	Consult your doctor if the pain is significant enough to hinder your day-to-day activities. Not seeking treatment for a long time may cause permanent nerve damage and muscle weakness of the hand.  

Symptoms
CTS isnt an acute disease. The symptoms will appear gradually, increasing in intensity overtime. 
Intermittent tingling or burning sensations, numbness in index and middle fingers, sometimes a part of the ring finger and the thumb of your hands, are the most frequent symptoms. Waking up at night due to pain in the hand which is relieved by hanging the arm out of the bed is a common complaint of patients having CTS. Clumsiness when picking up small objects, pain and weakness of the hands are also seen in some cases. 

People at risk
Females and the middle aged population have a higher chance of getting CTS. In addition, conditions like hypothyroidism, diabetes, obesity and having close family members with the same condition may increase the risk of CTS. Interestingly, this is a common complaint in pregnancy because the fluid gets accumulated in the tunnel, leading to compression of the nerve. 
Research has revealed that the risk of CTS is increased in workers belonging to certain professions. If your job involves forceful motions of the hand with the wrist held in an awkward position for a long time, eg: writers, machine operators, you may also have an increased chance of having CTS. Gamers and typists are also believed to have a higher risk , though it is yet to be proven clinically. Another factor worthy of note is that in Sri Lanka, housewives who are doing frequent chores like squeezing the coconuts scraps to get the milk and manually washing clothes with forceful hand motions are also said to have a higher prevalence of CTS. 

Diagnosis 
Diagnosis is mainly clinical, meaning that the doctor will diagnose the condition after getting a proper medical history and doing a proper clinical examination. Clinical examinations will include tests specifically designed to diagnose CTS. 

Treatment 
If the disease is mild, your doctor may prescribe you a special splint to be worn at night, immobilizing the wrist. This will in turn reduce the pressure on the nerve, relieving the symptoms. Also, an injection of steroids may be recommended. 
But if these measures dont help, or if the symptoms hinder your day to day activities, you may have to opt for Surgery. Dont be anxious though, Carpal Tunnel Release surgery isnt a major surgery and is usually done as an outpatient procedure. 
In this procedure, the surgeon will relieve the pressure on the nerve by dividing the transverse carpal ligament interconnecting the wrist bones on either side, through a small incision made in the wrist under anesthesia. 

Lifestyle changes 
If you are having CTS symptoms or belong to a group at risk of having CTS, small lifestyle alterations will do wonders towards relieving symptoms or from preventing them from appearing in the first place. 
Since the symptoms usually appear during sleep, try to avoid sleeping with your wrist bent.

Is your heart on the right side 
	

Medicine is a gloomy and serious topic for most people, with illnesses,needles, hospitals and suffering coming to the forefront of their minds. But as many aspects of mother nature are, the subject of medicine is highly interesting. Learning about the build and the functions of human body can be quite fascinating. Even more intriguing are the rare cases where mother nature itself deviates from the original prototype, which gives rise to various abnormalities compared to the norm. We will take you through one such intriguing path in this weeks Health Capsule. 
Usually, the human anatomy follows some basic rules. One heart, two kidneys, one liver and one spleen, heart on left side, liver on right, spleen on left and so on.This normal arrangement is called the situs solitus. Did you know that there was a condition called situs inversus, where all the body organs are the mirror images of the situs solitus So in a person with this condition, the heart would be situated on their right side and the liver would be in the left. 
The condition is very rare, and occurs about 1 in 10000 people.More interesting is the fact that this condition presents in some cases of mirror image twins. This is a condition where the fertilized ovum is divided later than what usually happens in mono-zygotic (identical) twins, resulting in twins that are literally the mirror images of each other, and in these cases, both inside and out. 
Now, some of our readers might be thinking that this must be quite a serious condition, with all their organs parked on the wrong side. But interestingly, this isnt the case. Many of these people live a complete normal life. Until recently, where radiological investigations like chest x-rays and CT scans became abundant, most of them led a normal healthy life, without being discovered at all. Im sure that youd be intrigued to know that Enrique Iglesias, the famous singer is also a known person having situs inversus. 
There is also the condition called isolated dextrocardia, meaning right heart in Latin,in which, as youve probably guessed by now, the heart is situated on the right side. So, when youve finished reading this article, dont forget to put your palm on your chest wall, feeling for your heartbeat, and check if your heart is on the right side after all. And the next time when you read something on medicine, always try to look for that intriguing story which is disguised as heavy medical jargon.

Israel arrests suspects in probe over German submarine deal
	

JERUSALEM AFP July11, 2017 
Israeli police have arrested seven people this week over an alleged corruption scandal involving a submarine deal with Germany which reportedly involves people close to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. 
As part of the ongoing investigation being carried out by the national crimes and investigation unit this morning another suspect was arrested and is being questioned, police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said on Tuesday. 
Tuesdays arrest comes a day after six other Israelis were taken in for questioning on suspicion of offences including bribery and money laundering over a deal to buy Dolphin submarines from Germanys ThyssenKrupp. 
Three were released to home arrest, while three others were remanded. 
Media reports have alleged a conflict of interest over the role played by David Shimron, a relative of the prime minister and the Netanyahu family lawyer who also represents ThyssenKrupp in Israel. 
In February, the justice ministry announced it had launched an investigation into the affair, stressing however that Netanyahu himself was not a suspect in the case.

LankaClear records best ever financial performance in 2016/17
	
LankaClear (Private) Limited, the operator of Sri Lankas national payment network LankaPay, held its 15th Annual General Meeting on June 28th at the Kingsbury Hotel.
The company was incorporated in 2002 under the guidance and approval of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka as the national cheque clearing house.
s owned by the Central bank and all the registered commercial banks in the country in a Public Private Partnership (PPP).
The company operates the national payment network that facilitates all interbank payments on behalf of its member banks and financial institutes, under the brand name of LankaPay. Through this critical backbone network, LankaClear has paved the way for the general public to access financial services even from the rural most location in the country.
LankaClear recorded the best ever financial performance in over 15 years of its existence by achieving the highest ever revenue of Rs.801mn at a healthy YoY growth of 33 percent and Profit before tax of Rs.322mn indicating a very positive bottom line.
This growth was predominantly driven by the new product lines under the Common Card and Payment System (CCAPS) and confirms that the company is on the right track with appropriate strategies that have been executed to perfection during the year paving the way to exceed the anticipated results.
The company also maintained a healthy Return on Asset (RoA) ratio of 16 percent and Return on Equity (RoE) ratio of 17 percent, which indicated YoY growth of 33 percent and 31 percent respectively.
LankaClear closed the year with a strong balance sheet with Net Assets reaching Rs.1.7 billion, which was a 20 percent growth compared to the previous year. The company also declared the highest ever dividend for the shareholders in 2016/17.
The financial year 2016/17 saw an impressive growth in the adoption of services of LankaClear as well as a greater penetration of electronic payments. The most spectacular growth was achieved in the transaction volumes of the real time payments area (CEFTS) where the company achieved a phenomenal YoY growth of 1553 percent. The primary driver for this was the fact that LankaClear team was able to attract a larger number of new members to the system during the year. The company also experienced an impressive YoY volume growth of 83.5 percent to reach a cash withdrawal volume of 26 million in the Common ATM Switch (CAS) where the total monthly cash withdrawal and balance inquiry volumes exceeded 3.5 million transactions towards the latter part of the year. The transaction volumes of SLIPS reached 27 million at a modest growth of 15 percent, which was primarily driven by the campaigns carried out among the public sector encouraging them to move towards electronic payments.
Contrary to the popular beliefs that cheque volumes would go down with more and more citizens and businesses adopting electronic payment modes, in reality, the volume of CITS grew YoY by 4.55 percent. When the reason for this growth was analyzed, it was discovered that a major contributor to this growth was volumes from the North and the East.
This is evidently due to the increased financial opportunities being presented in these areas after 30 years of war where a larger segment of the population are now associating with banks where there first payment instrument is a cheque.
During the year 2016/17, the total number of ATMs connected to the Common ATM Switch (CAS) grew to over 3950 island wide accounting for 99.5 percent of the total ATMs in the country.
The year was also further enriched by the launch of JustPay initiative by LankaClear to drive digital payments in the retails segment of the business via CEFTS. This area is currently untapped and most of the transactions happen via cash. With the objective of converting at least 20 percent of the cash based retail payment transactions into digital mode by the year 2020, the company took the lead role and together with the banks launched this initiative.
During the year LankaClear reached another milestone by becoming the first entity in the country to achieve Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS) certification, which is the highest level of security compliance in the payments card industry in the world. The company also introduced the online mode for cheque clearing during the year to enhance the efficiency of the existing process and became the first entity in South Asia to do so.
Expressing his views on the companys performance Anil Amarasuriya, Chairman LankaClear stated; I am indeed proud to acknowledge the role played by LankaClear in revolutionizing Sri Lankas financial services industry over the past decade through innovative inter-bank solutions. The LankaPay Common ATM switch (CAS), our flagship product, which was launched in 2013 is now well anchored and continues to drive growth in the local financial services sector. Connecting the far regions of the country through a common platform, the LankaPayCAS continues to give millions of Sri Lankans easy access to their funds via an island-wide inter-bank network.
However, faced with our greatest competitor, cash, the overarching priority for the year was to trigger a shift towards a cashless society.
Hence, we focused our attention on growing on CEFTS (Common Electronic Fund Transfer Switch), rolled out in 2015,to gain considerable traction in the market. Undoubtedly, these offerings have paved the way for a new chapter in Sri Lankas financial services sector. I firmly believe that this is just the beginning, and for LankaClear there is much more work to be done, especially if we are to support Sri Lankas goal of becoming a financial hub in the South Asian subcontinent.
Explaining the strategy behind LankaClears success General Manager and Chief Executive Officer, Channa de Silva, stated It is not a new phenomenon to note that change, as we are now experiencing it, is happening at the speed of thought. Globalization and the rapid pace of technological advances are increasingly affecting both private and corporate customers. This ever changing business landscape has triggered the demand for dynamic user interfaces, greater availability, higher security and more importantly services at their fingertips. In other words, need of the hour is the availability of convenient services to save valuable time of demanding individuals. And we have deepened our resolve to become the main facilitators of our countys economic progress by giving every citizen the opportunity to save that all important factor; TIME. The concept of pull-payments, in addition to the existing credit transfers of CEFTS, was identified as step forward in this direction and the launch of JustPay initiative was in-line with this thought process.
We also enhanced our digital infrastructure by implementing new technologies and processes while sharpening existing ones, all in order to bring about faster turnaround times. Again the internal focus was on the value of time, thus, reducing the time to market for our services.
With the above strategies in place and greater execution, we were quite successful in achieving our main objective of accelerating the growth trajectory of the company by leveraging on our established position as the Trusted National Payment Network in the country.

Of the two, the one who had to go first- saying adieu to the topmost post in public administration  had got a shelling  a bellyful so to speak- from Number One before getting his walking papers, they say.
A communique issued by him that created a hullabaloo in the country was the cause for the latest rebuke he had got from his boss. He had been taken to task on a number of previous occasions as well, they say.
Now this mandarin is said to be planning to get lost in the land of kangaroos.
The other mandarin who had to quit the powerful top job of looking after the countrys security has got a consolation job of being the care-taker of the countrys interests in a foreign land.
In his case, he had got his fingers burnt when he reportedly mishandled two tenders. One tender was related to a food supply and other to the purchase of a ship, they say.

MYTH: Drinking green tea can help you lose weight and boosts your metabolism 

BUSTED: There is some truth in this. Green tea has antioxidants and also has a small amount of caffeine, therefore, as a stimulant when taken regularly, it can help increase ones metabolism. What is advantageous about green tea is that you have it without milk and sugar, so there are no calories gained. This is why people lose weight when they drink green tea. People can also have plain tea without milk and sugar and get the same result, but you rarely see anyone drinking plain tea without one of these. Plain coffee too has the same effect as it is a stimulant, but if you add cream or sugar the results are lost, explained Professor Arjuna de Silva, Professor in Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Ragama.

Even though the Ocean University in Mattakkuliya does not have the UGC recognition it has claimed in its website and advertisements that it was a UGC recognized University, Daily Mirror learns.
The Ocean University formally known as the National Institute of Fisheries and Nautical Engineering (NIFNE) was established as a University in 2014 under Parliament Act No 31 of 2014 and had applied to UGC recognition last year. However, UGC has not granted the recognition as yet.
According to the web site of the OCU, it offers four degree programmes and a range of diplomas and certificate level courses and mobile programmes claiming that the university has the UGC approval.
Ocean University has been recognized as a degree awarding university by the University Grants Commission (UGC), Sri Lanka and it has been given the authority to offer four degree programmes in the fields of Marine Science and Nautical Engineering, the website said.
The University which is under the purview of the Skills Development and Vocational Training Ministry is reportedly running with insufficient basic academic requirements and infrastructure facilities. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

Paying private debts at public expense!
	

There were three hopefuls in the running for the EP governor at the outset. And of the threesome, the one heading the list was Atha of the old left hailing from the Kegalle district. When it appeared that he was the most likely choice for the coveted post, many yahapalanaya stalwarts had fallen over one another to extend their well wishes to the veteran politico.

Meanwhile, an ASP (not of the khaki tribe) practicing diplomacy in the Arabdom too had entered the fray. In fact, he had come back home to conduct Poojas to invoke the intervention of deities on his behalf.
However, all interested parties had a surprise and the two hopefuls a jolt when a controversial turncoat character was suddenly appointed to the post.
Informed sources say that the appointment was the result of a recommendation that had come from a very high level. They say that this high office offered to the lucky one on a platter is a token of gratitude for a good turn done to a high authority some time ago. And a certain person with close ties to Sangha also was behind this unexpected appointment, they say.

Red alert on Uma Oya project ! Experts rule out complete recovery
	
Residents left out to dry as third leak continues
Cracks have appeared on the walls of my house where I was living with my wife, my kids and my mother for more than twenty years. There is not a drop of water in our well which used to be full. My vegetable cultivations are destroyed. I have no livelihood now. Farming is all I know. Please sir, help us to live. This is quoted from a letter written by R.M.Gnanasiri, from Dalukella, Mathetilla of Bandarawela. We met him outside the Bandarawela Divisional Secretarys Office, where he was waiting to meet the District Secretary (DS) to handover the letter. 
Gnanasiris house is just one among thousands of houses subject to cracks due to the adverse effects of Uma Oya Multipurpose Development Project which was initiated in 2008 by an Iranian contractor Farab under the Rajapaksa Government. Five-inch cracks started appearing on the walls of Gnanasiris house years ago. His house is located within a distance less than one kilometer from the tunnel. As relief, he still receives a mere Rs. 50 per day for dry rations. 
Tunnel excavation work taking place about 700 feet below the surface had caused three huge internal water leaks (the third one is still happening). All the wells and water springs in the area are dried up, causing a severe water shortage, instability of lands and destruction of cultivations and properties of villagers. Due to the third leak, eighty million litres of water per day is wasted. 
People complain that not only the previous government, but also the present government is responsible for all the disasters caused by the Uma Oya Project. They claim that the present government is continuing the project in the face of strong public opposition. Apart from facing a catastrophe, the villagers complain about irregularities in the resettlement of displaced villagers and compensation procedure in place. 
The issue surfaced again in newspaper headlines last month following a massive demonstration carried out by citizens of Bandarawela against the governments silent approach towards the impending natural and geological disaster caused by the project. 
During a tour of Bandarawela, the Daily Mirror, observed several houses having severe cracks on their walls. The cracks had surfaced three months ago. People are also experiencing hardships due to the availability of only a limited amount of water in the tanks for daily consumption, provided by the Divisional Secretariats Office. 
Sixty five percent of the Uma Oya, which starts from Piduruthalagala Mountain, belongs to the Uva Province while 35% belongs to the Central Province. The objective of the Uma Oya Multipurpose Development Project was to construct two dams named Dyraaba and Puhulpola, an underground hydro-electric power generation plant and a tunnel. As planned, the tunnel will connect the dams and transfer water to the power plant which will hopefully add 120 MW to the national electricity grid. The hydro-electric power generation plant will also be directed to the Hambantota dry zone and some dry areas of Wellawaya. 
The first huge internal water leak was reported from Makul Ella area. Second one was from Udaperuwa. As a result of the leakages, all the water in water springs and wells seeped into the tunnel. Consequently, all the water springs dried up in Wehagala-thenna, Makul Ella, Heel Oya, Palleruwa and Udaperuwa. The third water leak is still happening, drying up water springs in Keenigama, Bindunu Wewa, Hapugas Ulpatha and Dik Ulpatha. Geologists said the tunneling had damaged the soil structure on the earth. Where ever the soil structure wasnt stable, cracks appeared and sections of some houses and buildings started sinking.
Dried lives of villagers
Nilanthi Sanjeewani, a mother of two from Bandarawela, requested President Maithripala Sirisena to pay thorough attention to their problems and order the relevant authorities to bring a solution. 
Temples at Makul Ella, Egodagama, Heel Oya and Kurundu Golla and Palleperuwa Mosque are among the religious places affected. This problem has also affected the education of our children. They also worry about these issues. Cracks have appeared on some buildings of Makul Ella School, Adikaram School and Dharmashoka Central College in Bandarawela. We are afraid to send our children to school given this situation, she said. 
Sixty-five-year old R.M.Sumanawathi said all what is left for them is to pray to God to take them out this trouble and help them to live like before. 
Water is more valuable than gold. All the neighbors used to take water from our well. After the Uma Oya Project, our well dried up. Distributing water once a week isnt enough. They will distribute water only as long as the project continues. What will happen after the completion of the project she asked. 
Mapa Menike is a female farmer. She said there isnt a drop of water in her paddy field for even an ant to drink. There are six-inch cracks in her field. 
We used to depend on the earth. Now, we dont have a livelihood because of what Appachchi (Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa) did merely for his personal benefits. He prioritized only his well-being. That is why we are all helpless now. We have been thrown into a situation where we have to beg on streets, she said. 
Bloated estimate
Meanwhile, charging the previous government, CaFFE Executive Director Keerthi Thennakoon said the estimate for the Uma Oya Project was bloated by USD 248 million in January 2009 due to commissions. 
Issuing a press release recently, he said former Irrigation Ministry Secretary A.D.S.Gunawardena resigned from his post on January 9, 2009 noting his reluctance to sign the project agreement that costs an additional sum of USD 248 million to the Sri Lankan Government. 
constructors Unprepared
Bandarawela Divisional Secretary G.G.N.Gunaratne said damages began being reported when the excavation of the tunnel began. 
A number of landslides occurred on October 29, 2014 in some areas of the Badulla District including Koslanda, killing at least 16 people and leaving around 200 missing. I am unable to verify the environmental connection between the landslides and the geological damage caused by the tunnel excavation of the Uma Oya Project. I doubt there is a connection. It was on December 26, 2014, that all the damages were done to houses, two days after the first water leakage, he explained. 
According to him, neither the villagers nor the constructors expected such damage and therefore constructors failed to address the issue and act properly. 
Govt. to face more losses
Meanwhile, the Head of Geology Department of Peradeniya University Professor Jagath Goonatilake said its a huge waste of funds and effort if a decision is taken to terminate the project after completing more than 70 percent of it. 
We are giving instructions to them on how to minimize the harm. It is pointless to terminate the project now. Wrong areas need to be corrected so that the constructors can continue with the rest of the project, he said. 
The Director of Environment Conservation Trust, Sajeewa Chamikara said that the project was initiated to provide water for development projects launched by the Rajapaksa Government in the Hambantota District. He claimed that the Central Environment Authority (CEA) was compelled to give approval for the project after being pressurized by Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa despite the CEA identifying the potential harm. 
Chamikara said that a number of small irrigational and hydro-electric projects operated from the water of the Uma Oya are under risk. Uma Oya water also feeds the Rantambe Reservoir and the Bathmedilla Project. All these projects are also under risk due to the transfer of water from Uma Oya through the Iran funded project, he said. He emphasized that ultimately there will be a decrease in the number of rice and vegetables being cultivated in the areas affected by the Uma Oya Project. Chamikara was of the view that the fundamental human rights of people who use water under the Mahaweli Project are also being violated. At this rate, the government will have to allocate more money to supply water to such agricultural work in the absence of water from Uma Oya, he said.
Demands to terminate project
Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) member for Uva Provincial Council Samantha Vidyarathna said regardless of the efforts taken and funds spent on the Uma Oya Project thus far, it should be terminated in order to prevent harmful impacts which will occur during excavation of the remaining 5.5km of the tunnel. 
Following are the demands presented by Uva PC member Vidyarathna to the government. 
Destructed houses should be rebuilt. 
	Leakage should be repaired without further delay. 
	Excavation of the tunnel and the entire project should be terminated. 
	Affected villagers should be compensated. 
	Lands should be provided for villagers whose cultivations were destroyed. 
	Solutions should be offered to those who lost their self-employment and small/ middle scale business. 
	A broader investigation should be carried out on the geological situation in the surrounding areas to identify potential future disasters. 
	A Presidential Commission should be set up to estimate the external environmental, social, agricultural and economical damages.
Suspension of drilling
Last week, the Mahaweli Development and Environment Ministry announced the suspension of drilling operations in the Uma Oya Project for a period of ten days until a solution was found for the water leakage.
It was also reported that drilling machinery utilising modern technology will be flown in from Switzerland before July 18.
The suspension came after President Maithripala Sirisena summoned those involved in the Uma Oya Project for a meeting in an attempt to find a solution to the situation that has arisen in the area surrounding the project.
Authorities not listening to professionals: Prof. in Geology
Professor in Geology at University of Peradeniya H.A Dharmagunawardena when contacted by the Daily Mirror said the natural and geological damage caused by the Uma Oya tunnelling is so immense that a complete recovery of the disaster was impossible. 
Water leaks are inevitable when excavating a tunnel. But, the issue with the Uma Oya Project is that the water leaks are so heavy that they get out of control. This is the first time such a tunnelling method has been used in Sri Lanka. Fixing the leak is extremely difficult with this tunnelling method because theres no direct access to the leak. 
The tunnel stretches several hundreds of metres below the surface. The hydraulic pressure that it creates in water columns above the grounds, where leaks have occurred, is enormous. These leakages suck the water from the shallow ground into the tunnel causing a declension of ground water level at the surface. As a consequence, the areas go dry and all social and environmental damages occur. Ground water recharge in the future will be at a very low level. If the tunnel isnt completely sealed off, the water will leak even after the tunnel is filled with water. 
Unfortunately, millions of litres of water that leaked into the tunnel were removed from the water springs. Our people have destroyed these precious resources of water which could have been preserved for years. The damage will be permanent. The workers will be able to rectify only a part of the damage, but not fully. 
Sri Lankan geologists were alarmed about the issues much before the incidents took place. But, it appears that the Iranian Construction Company wasnt willing to follow our instructions. Despite all the disasters that have taken place, it seems that the authorities still dont lend an ear to the advice of professional geologists. That is why they are now seeking assistance from abroad to fix the leaks.
When local expert panels studied the first leak which occurred in 2014, they warned that there would be more leaks. Unfortunately, our advice wasnt heeded by the constructors. There have been recommendations and meetings to raise the awareness about the possible impacts of the unhealthy tunnelling carried out using sub-standard machinery. It poses a question whether these recommendations were followed. 
The feasibility study carried out on the project hasnt foreseen the problems adequately. Ground water wont fill up again as before due to the absence of the previous pressure. Even after the leaks, it will take years for the dried water springs to fill. 
If the tunnel is going to proceed like this, I think there will be many problems. There will be many leakages if the tunnelling continues without appropriate measures being taken. 
A thorough pre-tunnelling investigation should be launched to detect the potential threats that will surface with the proceedings of the tunnel. The ground areas must be stabilized before starting further excavations. However, even if the leakages are rectified somehow, what is the guarantee we can have that there wont be more leakages

Retrieving Katchatheevu from SL is the only solution: TN Minister
	
Reiterating its stand on Katchatheevu, the Tamil Nadu government on Tuesday strongly opposed the recent legislation passed by the Sri Lankan government, which restricts certain fishing practices, and asserted that it would retrieve the ceded islet from the neighbouring island nation.
Responding to DMK MLA and former Minister K.P.P. Samy (Thiruvottiyur), who raised the issue during the debate on the demand for grants for the Fisheries department in the Assembly, Fisheries Minister D. Jayakumar said, We will not accept the legislation [passed in the Sri Lankan Parliament].
The Minister listed the efforts made by Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami, who opposed the legislation in his letter to the Prime Minister, and added that the State government would continue to oppose the legislation. Retrieving Katchatheevu is the only solution to the problem. We will definitely retrieve Katchatheevu, Mr. Jayakumar reiterated emphatically.
Later in the debate, when the Minister referred to the ceding of the islet to Sri Lanka in 1974, DMK Deputy Floor Leader Duraimurugan said the then Central government under Prime Minister Indira Gandhi did not keep the then State government under Chief Minister M. Karunanidhi in the loop over its decision.
Congress Legislative Party leader K.R. Ramasamy (Karaikudi), however, maintained that the situation back then was different from what it is currently, and hence, the debate should focus on the future course of action.
Mr. Duraimurugan listed the efforts made by Mr. Karunanidhi to ensure certain rights for fishermen over Katchatheevu and claimed that the AIADMK chose to walk away from the all-party meeting and from the House, which had passed a resolution to this effect. (The Hindu)

SLC to compensate stripped ground staff
	
While apologizing to the causal workers engaged as ground laborers at the Sooriyawewa stadium in Hambantota as they were asked earlier to hand over their trousers to obtain the daily wages, Sri Lanka Cricket announced today that steps would be taken to compensate the workers.
It was reported that about 100 workers who were recruited as ground staff on temporary basis had gone to obtain their salaries after six days of work at the Sooriyawewa stadium during the Zimbabwe tour of Sri Lanka when they were asked to hand over the trousers given by the SLC before paying their wages on Monday.
The workers were disappointed at the request because they had not taken an extra trouser to wear after handing over the trouser given by the SLC. Some workers had no choice but to go home in their underwear.
In a statement the SLC said, the President and Executive Committee of Sri Lanka Cricket are perturbed by the reported incident.
We wish to apologize to those subjected to this ignominy, and will take steps to ensure they are compensated the statement said.
They said an inquiry has been initiated into the matter and stern action will be taken against those responsible.(DS)

Toenail Fungus -How to prevent yourself
	


Also known as Onychomycosis or tinea unguium toenail fungi are defined as an overgrowth of fungi in the nails of the toes.
This occurs as a result of an infection entering through cracks in your nails or splits on your foot skin. Although, fungal infections can affect the finger nails as well, toenails are at a higher risk due to frequent contamination with possible fungal organisms and retention of moisture in between toes. 
The disease can be clinically identified easily as the nail would become discoloured, thickened and distorted. 


What are the causes
The fungi are usually harmless to the skin even though various favorable conditions mentioned below may lead to invasion of different types of fungi, resulting in infections. 
Fungi grow easily in warm, dark and moist places like feet whereas the growth will get enhanced due to following reasons, 

Dirty and wet feet, which are not maintained in a proper hygienic manner. 
	Wearing shoes which causes feet to get hot and sweaty. 
	Not wearing slippers when walking around the public places like roads, mud and parks. 
	nHaving a poor immune system. 
	Having diseases like diabetes, high cholesterol, psoriasis or peripheral Arterial diseases. 
	Habit of washing legs frequently without getting dried them up properly. 
	Wearing socks with wet feet- often school children 
	Using nail polish over a long period of time without removing. 
Moreover, a higher risk of toenail fungus can be seen in 
Patients with Diabetes 
	People over 65 years of age 
	People are having underlying heart conditions associated with less blood circulation 
	Women wearing artificial nails regularly e.g. models and actresses 
	Regular usage of public swimming pools 
	Presence of a skin injury around the nail or on the nail 

Major signs and symptoms
observed in patients with toenail fungi include, discoloration of the nails where they may become white, yellow or black, notable changes in the shape of nails, thickening of nails, unusual odor, easy breaking of nails or parts, pain when a pressure is applied, tenderness and signs of inflammation on the skin around the nails with itchiness, cracks, reddening and swelling. 
Diagnosis - A complete history from the patient about the changes of the nails, skin around the area, habits of washing hands, feet often and positive family history is important whereas a thorough physical examination should also be carried out in order to get an idea about the diagnosis. 
Treatment- If the patient is having a severe pain, 

Antifungal tablets can be used once or twice a day for few months. 
	Special paint called antifungal nail paints can be applied directly on the nail over several months. 
BUT, in severe cases complete removal of the nail is recommended. 
Furthermore, latest treatments like laser treatment where a laser is used to terminate the fungi can also be considered as an option. 
How to prevent yourself
Have a nutrition-rich meal. 
	Use antifungal power or spray on a regular basis. 
	Avoid wearing artificial nails and nail polish. 
	Always wear slippers without staying barefoot. 
	Make sure to dry your feet after washing them. 
	Wear socks when wearing shoes, boots. 
	Always use cotton socks, which absorb moisture. 
	Keep the nail short by cutting and trimming. 
	Dont share towels, Socks, trimmers with others and make sure the towels and socks are clean and washed regularly. 
	When using salons make sure that the equipment is properly washed, cleaned or sterilized.

Use of polythene, rigifoam, shopping bags banned
	
Central Environment Authority (CEA) has banned the use of polythene lunch sheets, rigifoam boxes and shopping bags, with effect from 1st of September.
In a bid to make Sri Lanka polythene-free and find a sustainable solution to solid waste management, President Maithripala Sirisena has announced a number of measures including the ban on the import, manufacture and sale of lunch sheets and a ban on the use of polythene for decorations.
Cabinet approval was granted on Tuesday for a series of measures proposed by the President in his capacity as the Minister of Mahaweli Development and Environment to gradually end the use of polythene and thus minimize its environmental impact.
While banning polythene use for decorations the manufacture, sale and use of polythene of 20 microns or less for essential activities on the approval of the Central Environmental Authority (CEA).
The short term measures also include the ban on the manufacture, import or sale of containers, plates, cups, spoons made of polystyrene, the ban on the sale of processed or cooked meals packed in polythene containers and the promotion of paper, cloth or reed bags or biologically degradable plastics for customers when purchasing items in stores, prohibition of burning polythene and plastic in open places introduction and promotion of biologically degradable polythene and plastics.
Tax concessions would be provided to import machinery for the manufacture of biologically degradable plastic and a cess tax of 15% on the import of plastic raw material and goods.
In the long term the use of recycled plastic products would be banned.
Cabinet Spokesman and Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne told the reporters at the weekly cabinet news briefing yesterday that the short term measures will be effective from Tuesday after the proposals were approved by the Cabinet.
The long and medium term measures need legislative approval for their implementation and therefore it takes time.
Responding to a journalist, he said people would go back to good old habits of using perishable lunch wrappers and food containers when the ban of polythene was in place. (Sandun Jayasekara)

A 39-year-old mother, ignoring the wails of her three young daughters had walked away with her paramour of 31 years of age, Ambalantota Police said.
She had left the 59-year-old husband and three daughters of ages 22,19, and 16 as a result of a love affair she had developed with a young man of 31 years.
When the Ambalantota Police were investigating on a complaint received by them and calling all parties to the dispute, the mother had insisted that she wants to live with the new young lover.
The three daughters had vehemently protested at the behaviour of their mother, however the mother had been so adamant and left the police station with her lover.
The depressed husband who had watched the scene from a side had later signed the police complaint book and left the site. The police had advised the mother until such time a divorce is obtained to recognize her legal husband. (Sanath Gamage)

Will not let Govt. close Dambulla Viharaya: BBS
	
The Bodu Bala Sena (BBS) today said that it would not let the Government close the Dambulla Raja Maha Vihara Complex or any other temple in the country using any international laws.
Addressing the media at the BBS head quarters at Rajagiriya today, its Chief Executive Officer Dilantha Withanage said the Archeological Act was created by foreigners to not to protect our archeological sites but to ruin them.
Most of the acts were created to ruin our heritage, he said.
We will not let Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam to bend the law as he wants and we will give our full support to battle of the Mahanayake Theras against closing the temples, he said,
Meanwhile, Sinhala Ravaya General Secretary Magalkande Sudaththa Thera said that Dambulla Raja Maha Vihara was not a monument to close for visitors and the Minister had not even requested the permission of the trustees of the Temple Ven. Ambagaswewe Rahula Thera.
We are glad to hear the decision taken by the Archeological Advisory Committee on immediate conservation measures of the statues and paintings at the temple. But there is a proper procedure for that and there is no need to close the entire temple complex, Ven. Sudaththa Thera said.
The Government is trying to take revenge on the Asgiri Chapter including the working committee of the Sangha Sabha by closing the Dambulla Raja Maha Vihara Complex, he said.
We have received information regarding the closure of the Dambulla Raja Maha Vihara Complex forcibly. The Vihara is first a heritage of Buddhism and secondly a heritage to the world. The
The Thera requested the Prime Minister and the Education Minister to protect the Buddhist heritage instead of protecting world heritage. (Chaturanga Pradeep)
