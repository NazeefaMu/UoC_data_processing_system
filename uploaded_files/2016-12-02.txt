CFA Society Sri Lanka holds Charter Awards Ceremony and Annual Oration
	
CFA Society Sri Lanka recognized 31 individuals who successfully completed the CFA program at its 2016 Charter Awards Ceremony and Annual Oration at Kingsbury Hotel, Colombo. Dr. Indrajith Coomaraswamy, Governor of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka graced the occasion as the chief guest and orator.
Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA) designation, one of the most respected and recognized investment management designation in the world, offered by the CFA Institute in Charlottesville, Virginia, USA, a global association of investment professionals.?
The CFA programme provides a strong foundation of advanced investment analysis and real-world portfolio management skills. The course of study is organized into three levels and each level requires passing a six-hour exam.?
The programme curriculum increases in complexity as you move through the three levels: The CFA programme bridges current practice, investment theory, and ethical and professional standards in shaping the candidates to do investment analysis and portfolio management skills.
With 142,000 members in 73 countries around the world and with nearly 225,000 CFA programme candidates each year who sit for the CFA exams, the mission of the CFA Institute is to lead the investment profession globally by promoting the highest standards of ethics, education, and professional excellence for the ultimate benefit of society.
President, CFA Society Sri Lanka, Rachini Rajapaksa CFA, in congratulating the new batch of charter holders and Level III passed finalists, said that it is a milestone year for the Sri Lanka Society. Established in 2001, the local society in celebrating its 15th anniversary was proud to have grown to a membership of 185 excluding almost another 100 odd charter holders who have gone overseas to work.
She told the charter holders that by earning the 3 important credentials ?CFA? after the name, they were also embracing a totally new world of fulfillment, satisfaction, success and also responsibility and that their actions, behaviors, demonstration of knowledge at the place of work and outside shape perception and the culture of CFA Society Sri Lanka and CFA Institute.?
Since the actions of individuals ultimately impact the wider society, to be mindful to uphold the CFA Institute values and work towards the ultimate benefit of the investment fraternity, our country and the world. Rajapaksa went on to say that they are the future of finance and so to be a difference that matters!!
Governor in delivering the oration shared his personal experiences in relation to constructing a stable and prosperous society. Dr. Indrajith Coomaraswamy emphasizing on how one can construct a prosperous society and a prosperous economy stated that whatever plans we have for the economy will be very difficult to be achieved unless are routed in sound ethics and good values through good quality balanced growth.?
He said Sri Lanka can no longer drive growth through incremental foreign commercial borrowings and a new growth model should be with different mixes from the state and the private sector because the country?s debt dynamics don?t have the fiscal space to have only a state sector driven development model. ? ?
He told the young charter recipients that, building up credibility, integrity and reputation is more important than the material progress and emphasized the fact that, credibility and integrity built over the years should not be wiped out by a single act of rashness. He earnestly asked for the support of professionals on the major development projects proposed by the government as the economy will grow gradually over the next 5 years. He also urged all those who are working in the private sector, especially those in the capacity of decision making to think seriously about investing in Sri Lanka, as it is our duty and we owe our country. ?

China opposes external interference in SL: Jiechi
	
Chinese State Councillor Yang Jiechi was reported to have told former president Mahinda Rajapaksa and his entourage that China was opposed to any ?external intervention? in the internal affairs of Sri Lanka and the use of human rights as a political tool.
Former external affairs minister G.L. Peiris, who was one of those who accompanied Mr. Rajapaksa on a visit to China last week, said Mr. Jiechi was the principal officer of Chinese President Xi Jinping on foreign affairs.
Mr. Jiechi has said China believed that Sri Lanka was capable of handling its own affairs.
Members of Mr. Rajapaksa?s delegation said they were not opposed to economic development projects beneficial to Sri Lankans and warned that the allocation of 15,000 acres of land for a Chinese investment project would be resisted by the people.
They said it would have been ideal to stick to the original proposal of setting aside 750 acres of land for the project as initially envisaged and if necessary to be increased gradually.
Mr. Jiechi, who is a former foreign affairs minister, is in terms of protocol ranks above the Chinese foreign affairs minister. (Kelum Bandara)

COPE to probe questionable rice deal
	
The parliamentary Committee on Public Enterprises (COPE) will probe the Rs.18 billion rice import scam in which both the present and the previous regimes were allegedly involved, COPE Chairman and JVP MP Sunil Handunnetti told Parliament today.
He said more than 200,000 metric tons of rice had been imported in stages during the latter half of 2014.
Mr. Handunnetti said a consignment of 60,000 metric tons of rice had been imported without Cabinet approval just prior to the presidential election and that the country had lost Rs.18 billion from this questionable transaction.
He said the country had lost a further Rs.2.3 billion as a result of the decision made by the present regime to sell the remaining stock of rice.? "This is as serious as the bond scam," Mr. Handunnetti said.
Trade and Industries Minister Rishad Bathiudeen in his response said the rice was sold based on tenders obtained from several potential buyers. "The stock of rice was sold to the highest bidder on a Court order," he said. (Yohan Perera)

Responding to the decision taken by LPBOA president Gemunu Wijeratna not to strike today, IPPBA president Sarath Vijitha Kumara warned of action if others tried to operate buses. ?We will see what will happen if Gemunu decides to operate buses today,? he said.
Speaking to Daily Mirror at close upon midnight yesterday, Sarath Kumara said that all inter-provincial and Colombo based buses which operate from the Gunasinghapura and Bastian Mawatha bus terminals had come to a standstill.
Buses plying on all Inter Provincial Routes, including routes 1, 2, 4, 6, 9, 48, 49, -- which include Colombo - Jaffna, Colombo - Matara, Colombo - Batticaloa, and Colombo - Negombo buses and the buses all the Colombo Metropolitan bus routes would not run, he said.

All inter-provincial and Colombo based buses which were operated from Gunasinghapura and Bastian Mawatha bus terminals came to a standstill and no buses were operated in and outside of Colombo.
?We visited most of the bus terminals in Colombo, including Gunasinghapura and Bastian Mawatha. All bus terminals are deserted. Lanka Private Bus Owners? Association (LPBOA) President Gemunu Wijeratne couldn?t put his own buses to the street. He couldn?t even find a single driver to operate his buses, ?he added.

While speaking to the Daily Mirror, LPBOA President Gemunu Wijerathne said that he cannot join the ongoing bus strike as his association wants to serve the people.

Kumar Gunaratnam out today
	
Frontline Socialist Party (FSP) politburo member Kumar Gunaratnam, who was sentenced to one year's imprisonment for violating visa regulations, is to be released from the Anuradhapura Prison today (Nov. 2) after completing his sentence, the Prisons sources said yesterday.
He was sentenced to imprisonment by the Kegalle Magistrate on March 31, 2016. He was also fined Rs.50,000.
Confirming that Mr. Gunaratnam would be released today, the FSP yesterday said it would submit a fresh application to the Immigration and Emigration Department today itself seeking Sri Lankan citizenship for Gunaratnam.
FSP propaganda secretary Pubudu Jayagoda said they had applied for Sri Lankan citizenship for Mr. Gunaratnam on two previous occasions -- first on February 18, 2015 and next on November 2, 2015.
?The previous applications had been referred to the Ministry by the Department, and they have been stuck in the Ministry ever since. However, we shall apply again today,? he told Daily Mirror.
When asked if Mr. Gunaratnam would give up his Australian citizenship, Mr. Jayagoda said the Immigration Department here would have to grant him Sri Lankan citizenship first. According to international conventions, he said, a person should have citizenship of at least one country.
?If Australia revokes his citizenship, Kumar should have the citizenship of another country -- Sri Lanka,? he said.
He said they had met the Controller of Immigration and Emigration last evening and applied for a Sri Lankan visa for Kumar so that he could remain in the country after he was released, till his citizenship process was completed. Jayagoda said the Controller had issued the visa.
He said they would not immediately halt the Satyagraha outside the Fort Railway Station -- which they had launched calling for the release of Gunaratnam from prison.
?Today the objective of the Satyagraha is not only Kumar's release but also his gaining citizenship. We won?t call it off on account of Minister Nawinne?s remarks,? he said.
Internal Affairs Minister S. B. Nawinne had told in Parliament yesterday that Gunaratnam would be given Sri Lanka citizenship if he applied for it and gave up his Australian citizenship. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

## Title: Lankan couple whose family members were killed, granted NZ refugee status

Lankan couple whose family members were killed, granted NZ refugee status
	
A Sri Lankan couple fearing harm after their family members were shot and killed by underworld criminals in Sri Lanka has been granted refugee status in New Zealand.
According to Radio New Zealand, their initial application had been rejected by Immigration New Zealand, but in a newly-released decision, the Immigration and Protection Tribunal has upheld their appeal.
The tribunal heard the husband's uncle was murdered after he attempted to uncover corruption by the then-president Mahinda Rajapaksa.
He had survived being shot in 2010 and appealed for police protection, but was gunned down a second time - fatally - in 2011 in a busy street.
The husband's father was also murdered after seeking justice by someone hired by an "underworld figure", the news article said quoting local reports.
The wife had described the killers to the tribunal as "Government mafia".
The tribunal heard the husband, who is a Buddhist and owned a rental car business in Sri Lanka, has not sought justice for his uncle's and father's deaths, but left that responsibility to his older brother as the head of the family.
In March 2012, the couple and the husband's brother were shot at, close to their family home, by a gunman on a motorcycle.
The couple went into hiding and moved about Sri Lanka, yet a few months later received a series of threatening phone calls.
On one of the calls, the husband was told that he and his brother would be killed if they continued to pursue justice.
In April 2014, after three men came to his mother's house looking for him and his brother, he decided to travel to New Zealand with his wife on limited visas.
The couple said the killers operated with immunity under both the former and current governments - an allegation the tribunal said was likely to be true, citing Amnesty International's annual report on Sri Lanka.
"A new government in January brought constitutional reforms and promises of improved human rights protection," the report said.
"Many human rights challenges remained, including persistent use of arbitrary arrest and detention, torture and other ill-treatment, enforced disappearances and deaths in custody, and a long-standing climate of impunity for these and other violations."
The tribunal referred to a Guardian report that a Sri Lankan newspaper editor was shot and killed by a gunman after his paper published articles critical of President Rajapaksa's government.
It looked at an Asian Human Rights Commission report linking politicians and criminals in Sri Lanka, describing the situation as "guns, goons, the police and politicians acting illegally".
The couple presented evidence to the tribunal that included letters to and from local police, and a death threat from the drug dealer initially charged with murder written while he was still in custody.
The tribunal also discovered the suspected killer has links to the government via donations to a politician.
It ruled the couple can stay in New Zealand as refugees.
"On the facts as found, the Tribunal is satisfied that there is a real chance that the husband and the wife will be seriously harmed if they were to return to Sri Lanka, by [the suspected killer], or his associates, or by Rajapaksa supporters seeking revenge for attempts to bring him to justice for the deaths and uncover political links to the criminal underworld."

## Title: Let not the tallest Christmas tree prevent us from seeing the baby in the Manger
## Section: News Features
## Date: 2 December 2016 12:00 am
Let not the tallest Christmas tree prevent us from seeing the baby in the Manger
	
Sri Lanka celebrates the most commercialised Christmas in South Asia. The decorations, festivities, carnivals, parties, Santa Claus and Christmas trees are some elements promoted by commercial entities rather than the churches and religious organisations. The State patronage given to commercialised elements far outweighs religious values, further encouraging a ?commercialised Christmas.? The spirit of Christmas is absorbed and diluted with spirits and wine that take prominence in all advertisements, supermarket handouts and hampers. Apart from the criminal waste of wealth, it makes Christmas unpalatable to the ordinary Sri Lankan who is rooted and nourished by spirituality, humility, non-extravagance, sacrifice and love that meets the needy. ??
As early as in October, many newspapers spoke of another feature that will certainly adorn Christmas this year - ?The tallest Christmas Tree in the World? being put up at the Galle Face Green. The tallest tree, the biggest cake and also the longest Christmas chocolate are all modern expressions of Christmas that are associated with the business world - driven by profit or sidetracking people from the realities of society or even diverting them from the very essence of Christmas, thereby soon making Christmas a non-religious social event. ??
The irony is that the tallest tree is adjoining the Port City (now promoted as the ?Financial City?), which literally stands as the most controversial and much-debated project of the decade. What is the tree trying to achieve? Certainly, it will be grandly illuminated, diverting the attention of the people from the not-so-bright lights flashing from the Port City construction site. Is it to cover up all genuine concerns of the ordinary people as far as the Port City is concerned, and to divert the attention to the tree so that we will fail to observe what happens beyond? Or is it conveying to the world that trees will have to be constructed hereafter as they cannot be grown due to the impact of the Port City Project on the people and the environment? ??
However, the challenge for us would be to seek the child Jesus amidst all these distortions. Where do we seek Him? How do we identify Him? How do we worship Him? are questions that seem to have no relevance at all. ??
How do we capture the true meaning of Christmas? The central message of Christmas is about God coming into the misery of the world to be identified with those suffering, so that all may have fullness of life that those who are in darkness will see light and those who are in the valley of death will have life. ??
The Angels proclaimed the Birth of Christ, to humble and poor shepherds who were in the open fields. The proclamation about a baby born during a journey now starts in a stable, wrapped in swaddling clothes and laid in a manger (Luke 2:7) -- the most unfortunate and miserable condition to be born in -- all because of a decree by the rulers for everyone to be registered in his/her own home town. That was God?s entry into the world in human form. ??
This birth is proclaimed by angels as good news to the poor and humble shepherds. The good news is not solely about a saviour being born (the long anticipation of the Jews), but that he is born in a manger amidst the oxen and sheep, amidst the odour of dung and urine and just wrapped in swaddling clothes. This immersion of God Almighty into the misery of poverty and vulnerability of ordinary people is the wonder of Christmas not only in terms of geographical area, but accessible, because of the poorness of the stable, the vulnerability of a child in a manger. The place would not be barred for the poor where others too are free and come of their own accord. ??
What are the signs given to identify the child? You will find the baby wrapped in swaddling clothes and lying in a manger (Lk 2:12). -- A sign intelligible to the shepherds. ??
Mangers and stables are intrinsically linked to the life of a shepherd. Swaddling clothes, the rags are too familiar to the poor, used to cover their nakedness. God Almighty has been immersed not only in the misery of human beings, but is now wrapped and laid on things that are part and parcel of the most vulnerable community. ??
However, the tallest Christmas tree is in contrast to the signs given to identify the baby in the manger - The Saviour of the world. It stands tall in the background of the Port City, which perhaps the poor will not be able to enter, nor will there be a need ?for them to do so. The Port City will pauperize the ordinary citizens of this country, where the poor will be driven to the mangers and stables for survival and be dependent on the swaddling clothes or rags that will be thrown out of the Port City to clothe themselves. The tallest Christmas tree will be surrounded by tourist hotels, where a tourist will pay at least $150 per night (an ordinary peasantry farmer?s or tea-plucker?s monthly income). The tree will be a delight to the tourists, a ?free of cost offer? which will have no semblance of the manger referred to in the Christmas story. The tree also stands tall just next to the seat of political power where decisions are made that continue to cater the rich, and the Gospel story clearly indicates that Jesus is not born in Herod?s palace. The tree stands amidst the politics and economics of the country, which continue to pauperize the poor and make them even more vulnerable. The birth of Christ in a manger stands in contrast to the social reality around the tallest Christmas tree in the world. ??
The shepherds followed the signs and worshipped the child and returned joyfully (Lk 2:16 & 20). How do we worship the Christ born today? What consists of true worship at Christmas? How do we worship God in human flesh? It is in simplicity, through acts of self-sacrifice, self-denial, self-emptying, which are essentially the virtues of the Baby we celebrate at Christmas. ? ?To recapture the meaning of Christmas, we need to learn from the spiritual values that have nourished the civilization of this country over centuries, values that promote simplicity and not extravagance, values that promote mercy and compassion not self-indulged pleasure, values of sacrifice and sharing for the sake of the poor and vulnerable, not high spending to satisfy our selfish desires. ??
The tallest Christmas tree should remind every Christian of the Babel Tower (Gen 11), which not only tried to hide the sins of the city but was built by the sins of the city ? a symbol of disobedience of city dwellers against God. Symbolically-situated on the background of the Financial City, opposite the seats of political power, surrounded by pleasure and business hotels -- the fundamental question is, are we serving mammon or God (God or money) this Christmas? ??
We need to consciously travel through the miseries of our people and share their pain and hopelessness and become the beacon of hope and transformation in order to worship the child born in the manger. ? ??? Let us go over to Bethlehem and see this that has happened, which the Lord has made known to us and they went with haste and found Mary and Joseph and the baby lying in a manger (Lk 2: 15 & 16). ??
Let us not miss the Christ, amidst a commercialised Christmas in the city and let not the tallest Christmas tree (an unbiblical symbol) blind our eyes from the baby in the manger, whom we are called to worship and witness. ? ??

MR?s henchmen on course to destroy SLFP: Wijayamuni Soysa
	
Minister Wijith Wijayamuni Zoysa yesterday claimed former President Mahinda Rajapaksa?s henchmen were in overestimated mentality over him and added that they were in a mission to destroy the SLFP by using his popularity.
Addressing a media briefing, Minister Zoysa said several MPs, including Udaya Gammanpila, Wimal Weerawansa, Dinesh Gunewardena, Vasudeva Nanayakkara and Dew Gunasekara were overestimated about Mr. Rajapaksa.
??The formation the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) will directly lead to the destruction of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP). The SLPP?s symbol, the flower bud itself shows that it would not blossom. It was just a paper flower. A flower made by a piece of paper would never blossom. Expecting a paper flower to blossom is similar to a fairy tale,? he added.
He said according to his knowledge Mr. Rajapaska does not have any intention to divide the SLFP and he was still a member of that party.
?Earlier, no third force was able to topple the government in the Sri Lankan political history, and only the late Premier S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike and? Sri Nissanka were succeeded in doing so,? he added.
Meanwhile, he said they have made arrangements to re-organize the SLFP while establishing Bala Mandalas in each electorate island wide from December 4 in order to make the SLFP victorious in the upcoming elections.

Unnamed minister imports Rs.40M car
	
Social media are busy these days inquiring who the minister is who has allegedly imported a Mercedes Benz S300 costing Rs.40.1 million -- which is now parked at a ministerial car park in Battaramulla.
The social media have also posted several photographs of the motor car.
When this matter was brought up at a meeting held to reveal Cabinet decisions, Minister Rajitha Senaratne the co-spokesperson had said that he was unaware of it.
Websites also said that, at a time when people are heavily taxed, the importation of expensive luxury cars for the use of ministers was vehemently opposed by the people.
