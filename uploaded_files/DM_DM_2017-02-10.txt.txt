An Extraordinary Layman
	
Of all accomplishments known to man, avowedly the most difficult one is the attainment of noble Arahanthood; the total annulment of the lingering state of woe. 
The Buddha expressed poignantly in the Navabhikkhu Sutta that the high-water mark in wisdom cannot be reached with cursory and casual endeavour. It is for this reason that of the four groups that comprise the noble dispensation the vast majority who achieved the deathless state of Arahanthood were bhikkhus and bhikkhunis who renounced home life, and adopted avowed determination, unsurpassed resolve and unwavering concentration. 
Bhikkhuhood is likened to the open blue sky. In comparison, lay upasakas and upasikas have trudged on the endless samsaric path unable to reach the shore, held back by untold impediments and fetters, the weight of lay life called the boggy marsh. Many however were those who attained the first three stages of Nirvana. There exist rare exceptions to the rule though as they always do, and the one under discussion is one of four or five such extraordinary cases of sheer fascination where laymen reached the summit of freedom in spectacular manners. 
The rarity itself makes them awe-inspiring. Santhathi, a prominent minister under King Pasenadi, once quelled an uprising in the provinces and on his return to Savaththi the king rewarded him with the reign of his kingdom for seven days and also assigned him a woman well versed in dance and singing as was the custom with kings of yore. The minister, inebriated on all seven days and on the seventh, while proceeding to the bathing spot, While seated on an elephant he noticed the Buddha near the citys main gate, bowed his head in respect and went along on his way. When the Blessed One wore a slight smile on his face Ananda Thera queried as he always did, for Buddhas never smile without reason. But He made a stunning pronouncement; the chief minister would be meeting Him that day adorned in all his regalia, listen to a verse of four lines and pass into parinirvana in the sky at a height of seven palmyra trees. On hearing the Blessed Ones incredulous utterance the skeptics grounded in dangerously wrong views (michcha ditthi) scoffed that the Buddha blabbers whatever comes to mouth and bragged He would be exposed of His perfidy and be mocked in public. 
That day around lunch time the woman began entertaining the minister with her repertoire of dance and music but soon fell dead with open mouth and eyes. Serious gastric complications arising from inadequate food in order to enhance her appearance for the sake of the minister had caused her death. Liquor consumed by the minister for seven days evaporated like bubbles of water on a hot plate - Attakatha. The same evening he approached the Blessed One in the company of an entire battalion and pleaded that none but He can extinguish his heartrending sorrow, therefore to please help him. A large crowd of believers as well as heretics had gathered by then. 
The Buddha replied the minister, You have indeed come to the competent one to alleviate your sorrow and, the tears you have shed for her in past lives is greater than the water of the four oceans. A verse succinctly exquisite followed. Attaining Arahathood immediately upon the brief homily, chief minister Santhathi realised that his lifespan was at an end. He sought the Blessed Ones acknowledgement in confirmation. Buddha looked into his past and leaving no room for skeptics to be deceived by their own misconceptions, informed the chief minister to narrate his kamma not from the ground but from high above at a height of seven palmyrah trees for devotees to be inspired by their own meritorious deeds. He worshiped the Blessed One, rose to a height of a single tree, worshiped Him from there and descended. He worshiped the Blessed Ones feet again and reached an altitude of seven trees as told. He then began his moving narrative from a crosslegged position in the sky. Ninety-one kalpas ago in Vipassi Buddhas time, born to a family in the city of Bandhumathi I made people happy by proclaiming aloud in public the incomparable virtues of the Triple Gem. 
While still in the sky the Arahant accessed the fire element (Thejo Dhatu) to attain parinirvana. Flames sprang from the body to consume his flesh and blood leaving behind residue resembling jasmine flowers. They fell on a white cloth spread out by the Buddha, whereupon He placed them in his bowl to be enshrined in stupas on the four main streets in the city. People worshiped them to gain merit. When a debate arose within the congregation of bhikkhus whether chief minister Santhathi who passed into parinirvana in his glistening attire in the air deserves to be called samana or brahmana, the Blessed One declared  Monks, my sons do deserve to be called samana By way of sermon he further made the uniquely Revelational pronouncement Adorned in dazzling ornaments and livery, free of foul conduct, equanimous, sans all defilement, placid, controlled in faculties and established in the path, chaste, with laid down clubs and bickering shunned , he verily is called a monk, a brahmana, a saint . Many of those present attained states of Sovan etc.

Banks urged to get onboard Fintech platform to be part of ongoing disruption
	
By Shabiya Ali Ahlam
The financial institutions received a strong push by the leading local software development company hSenid to get onboard the financial technology (Fintech) platform to reap the benefits of the ongoing disruption acrossall industries.
With online transaction volumes moving towards a positive growth trajectory in Sri Lanka, the financial institutions were advised to actively embrace and evolve with the technology instead of allowing the telcos to dominate the online and mobile payment space.
Although the local financial institutions have been acknowledged to be taking part in the technological boom, the slow pace of absorbing the same will soon place the entities out of the online payment equation, cautioned hSenid CEO Dinesh Sapramadu yesterday while addressing a thought leadership forum attended by senior ranking
banking officials.
In order to successfully orchestrate the transformation towards a more customer-centric model, banks should formulate a cohesive C-level digital strategy which can be achieved by combining critical factors of banking such as customer behavioural psychology, optimizing distribution, building technology capabilities and synchronizing internal workflow with service delivery, opined Sapramadu.
It was pointed out that with the explosion of technology, the experience of customers across industries is influencing their expectations from their financial service provider. This, in turn, is said to be leading into an evolving customer-bank relationship, necessitating the banks to be more customer centric, embedding themselves in customers lives to meeting rising customer expectation.
Current macroeconomic forces and technology advents continuously reshape how we do business. Shoppers today no longer simply go to the nearest store, they grab the nearest digital device, so it is imperative for banks to keep abreast with this dynamic environment and seamlessly connect the digital consumer and business,
elaborated Sapramadu.
In a bid to meet customer expectations, it was suggested that the banks today need to allow frictionless, multi-devices anywhere and real-time interaction using channels not only limited to banking channels but beyond.
Pointing out that digital disruption in banking is not only limited to bridging the customer and the bank, hSenid shared that a trend is currently observed where the financial institutions converge with the other industries, especially the tech companies, to innovate and create distinctive products to meet customer expectations.
Allowing financial entities to be part of the ongoing disruption, hSeinds latest development is a financial technology platform for digitalization for financial institutions and alliances. The platform aims at assisting entities in the financial space to open up their core assets and gain access to new innovative disruptions.
Reaching the 20-year milestone this year, hSenid is an application and service provider for the telecom, financial and enterprise markets. It specialises in human resource applications and mobile applications for the enterprise and wireless markets. hSenid is also widely recognised for its reliable offshore and outsourcing capabilities. Currently it serves over 400,000 users globally across 18 industries in over 30 countries.

Buddhism in relation to gender and sexual diversity
	
Anger is like a hot coal which one picks up with ones hands and doesnt let go. One just simply burns unnecessarily. In life there are situations which trigger our anger. However, the wise ones are able to nip anger in the bud without letting things escalate and go out of control. 
When I was growing up, I had a lot of anger in me. Rage even. I would get hurt often and cry a lot as a result. However, the years have brought about a certain amount of wisdom in me.I rarely react in anger at anyone or any situation now. And I am much more tolerant in dealing with people and situations. If someone were to hurt me badly, one friend advised me to have some very real compassion towards the person who hurt me and say a silent blessing for that person. Niduk Weva, Neerogee Weva, Suvapath Weva -- translated as May you be without sorrow, May you have good health, May you be at Peace. I rarely get hurt these days. However, there are situations where I still do. 
Loving kindness is the antidote not only to fear but also to anger. When we love others without conditions, thats real love. In my heart I have so much love for people, animals and nature. And also towards myself. If we cannot love ourselves, our loving kindness practice is incomplete. These qualities which I have been developing have helped me see the connection between me and all people. 
In these times there are so many types of discriminations running rampant. Theres homophobia, biphobia, transphobia and many other things. I can fearlessly say that if the Buddha was alive in these times,he would have been an ally towards all people with their various gender and sexual orientations. 
Where anger is concerned, some people react negatively towards people who are not heterosexuals. This is a very limited way of thinking. We have to develop compassion towards everyone regardless of their gender and sexual orientations.We should move on with the times and adapt to the changes taking place in our society.

I cant help remembering the great Sri Lankan author Martin Wickramasinghe who wrote the gorgeous novel Gamperaliya. The story is about a family who is unwilling to change with the changing times and stagnates bitterly as a result. Martin Wickramasinghe advocated change. Change is a constant in our lives and if we dont accept it and move on, we will simply stagnate. 
In parting, my one wish for the Sri Lankan community would be to think wisely and not condemn people who are different to oneself or the general norm. I think in our society, transgenders suffer the most. They are most often misunderstood and ridiculed.They cant help being what they are and its very sad to see them being condemned by society.  The Buddha was an amazingly tolerant and compassionate being. If he were alive today, He would offer sanction towards all people with gender and sexual diversity. I wish people, especially in Sri Lanka to not only think wisely, but also to act wisely, and accept other people however different, with all their heart.

As my cousin so wisely said, thinking about death always reminds us why we need to make the most out of the time we have with our loved ones and people in general. It makes all other differences and problems we have with them seem insignificant. As Buddhists, this would be cultivating the truth of kindness towards all humanity. The truth of accepting people who are different to us. And on that note, I shall leave you for today.
With many loving wishes to you and yours and a happy and peaceful Poya to you all.

Govt. will not stop providing elephants for Peraheras: PM
	
The government will not stop providing elephants for Peraheras , Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said today.
Speaking during the final days opening of the annual Nawam Perahera of the Hunupitiya Gangararama Temple last evening, the Premier said President Maithirpala Sirisena and other relevant parties have discussed and decided on steps that should be taken to resolve the issues.

The Prime Minister lauded the Chief Incumbent of Gangaramaya Temple Ven. Galboda Gnanissara Thera for organizing the Perahera which he said is a daunting task given the situation in the society. It is a difficult task to find traditional dancers and others for the Perahera but the Venerable Thera had used his skills to find everything that is needed for the event, he said.
Venerable Kirinde Assaji Thera announced that the Chief Incumbent of Gangaramaya will soon launch a programme to bring down a variety of paddy that can be cultivated with minimum amount of water to face the ongoing drought. (Yohan Perera)

Indian doctor pulls live cockroach from womans skull
	
NEW DELHI AFP Feb9, 2017 - A 42-year-old woman had a painful crawling sensation behind her eyes when she woke up and was rushed to a local clinic where her nose was flushed and she was sent home. 
As the sensation didnt subside, a specialist explored her nasal passages with an endoscope and she learned the awful truth.

I saw some tiny legs moving inside, M.N. Shankar, an ENT specialist, told AFP on Wednesday. 
I looked further in and almost 5 cm from the tip of the nose I saw something unusual. 
I realised I was actually looking at the bottom of a cockroach. The invasive critter had burrowed deep inside her nose, almost to the base of the skull, and was still alive after roughly 12 hours, Shankar added. 
Using an instrument akin to a vacuum cleaner, Shankar managed to extract the cockroach from her skull intact -- still alive and kicking.

Internal audit on Mahendran should be probed: Lakshman Yapa
	
State Minister of Finance, Laksman Yapa Abeywardana yesterday said a thorough investigation must also be launched on the allegations made by a Central Bank internal inquiry against former governor Arjuna Mahendran in a manner, similar to the Commission of Inquiry appointed by President Maithripala Sirisena to probe the infamous bond scam.
Commenting on the statement that had been sent by Mr. Mahnendran to the media on Tuesday which was published on the following day (8) denouncing certain CB officials for conducting an internal audit on his expenses during his tenure, Minister Abeywaradana said Mr. Mahendran should reply to the allegations against him in the report and not to a former CB governor and CB officials.
Addressing the media at his office yesterday, Minister Abeywardana said the position of President Sirisena and the SLFP was that a formal inquiry was necessary on the findings of the CB audit report.
In his media statement, Mr, Mahendran alleged that the internal audit report was a work of a team of officials who worked in cahoots with a former CB governor to put him in troubles and it was unfair to compile such report and reveal it without calling for his explanation.
The crux of the issue is that whether he is guilty or not on these allegations. It is not a simple matter if he has committed 163 acts of corruptions, dishonesty or illegality as cited by the Review of the procedures adopted on foreign travel and other expenses of the former governor carried out by the Internal Audit Department of the CB.
According to the audit inquiry as quoted by Minister Abeywardana, the former governor Mr. Mahendran has booked in to more than one hotel in a single day during one of his foreign tours and claimed Rs. 523,393 as hotel bills. Surprisingly, he has also made hotel reservation for extra guests and has forwarded bills to the tune of Rs. 1,625,746.
Minister Abeywardana quoting the audit report said Mr. Mahendrans average monthly credit card expenses paid by the CB had been Rs. 34,427,772 and no invoice had been forwarded for reclaimed expenses to the tune of Rs. 7,870,027. The amount paid for the delay in settling personal expenses was Rs. 12, 096,618. Payment has been made to him for submitting unacceptable invoices against settlements was Rs. 1,586,888. Payment against settlement without invoices  Rs. 78,70,027. Stamp duty paid on personal expenses Rs. 274, 770. Procurements made violating standing orders of the CB  Rs. 523, 123. (Sandun A.

Nasheed to contest Maldives Presidential Election in 2018
	
Former Maldivian president Mohamed Nasheed announced yesterday that he would be contesting the Maldives Presidential Election in 2018 as a candidate representing the Maldives Democratic Party (MDP).
Addressing a news conference in Colombo, he said that he was eligible to contest the internal election in the Maldives.
The United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention ruled that my detention and arrest were unlawful and politically motivated. That ruling further goes on to say that my civil and political rights must be restored. This ruling clearly allows me to contest any election that I want to contest.
I hope to win the Maldivian Democratic Partys ticket as the Partys candidate of choice for the 2018 Maldives Presidential Elections. he said.
He also added that MDP would not boycott the elections on any account.
Pointing out that President Yameen had not adhered to any international ruling, he said the Maldives had left the Commonwealth because the Commonwealth wanted the Maldivian Government to reform.
We are a political party that engages in peaceful political activities. We would advocate and call upon the international community to assist us and be more robust in its engagement with the Government of the Maldives.
We hope that the Government of the Maldives will understand the need to be in the family of nations and not to move away from international norms, international rulings and international bodies as well, Nasheed said.
In response to a question on how the international community was responding to the current situation in the Maldives, Nasheed said that a number of countries were working behind the scenes to restore the political stability that the Maldives currently lacks.
We havent given up hope and we will continue to work with our international partners to see how they will be able to impress upon President Yameen the need to have an all inclusive election, he said.
The United Nations attempted to have an all party dialogue but this has not been very effective. We would, of course, like more engagement by the international community, he said.
Highlighting the strategic importance of the Maldives for the nations in the Indian Ocean, he noted that destabilisation of the Maldives would lead to instability in nations within the Indian Ocean. Therefore, he stressed the importance of the international community's having a plan; to bring back stability to the Maldives.
We would certainly like to see more engagement, and we would also like to see neighbouring countries having a view and a plan on the situation in the Maldives, he said.
Adding that President Yameen had been isolated in his bid for political power, Nasheed added that even former Maldivian president Gayoom was concerned about the deteriorating situation in the Maldives. (Sarah Muiz)

Navam Perahera Majestic pageant of Gangaramaya Raja Maha Viharaya
	
The Hunupitiya Gangarmaya Raja Maha Viharaya is of special significance as a sacred place of worship in the heart of the capital city of the country and also as an institution providing facilities for youngsters to become useful citizens to the country. 
Due to religious, social, cultural and educational activities undertaken by this temple under the exemplary guidance and direction of the present incumbent, Venerable Galaboda Gnaneswara Thera, the popular Podihammuduruwo, this temple has gained local and international reputation. 
History of the temple 
It was during the time of Venerable Devinuwara Jinaratana Nayake Thera that this temple was transformed to a nationally and internationally famous Viharaya. This Nayake Thera, a pupil of Hikkaduwe Sri Sumangala Nayake Thera was liked by the people who enabled him to transform an Aramaya or a hermitage on a marshy land to a popular place of Buddhist worship with an international reputation. The transformation had taken place within a very short period of time. Today Gangaramaya is the most popular place of Buddhist worship within the municipal limits of Colombo. This temple carries the three main features, Sharirika Dhathu (the physical remains of the Enlightened One), Maha Bodhi (the sacred Bo tree} and Buddha Rupa (Images of the Buddha). The main features of the temple include the viharaya(the main temple), Cetiya (Pagoda), the Bo tree, Vihara Mandiraya, Sima Malakaya and the relic chamber. Gangaramaya Sima Malakaya is unique in its structure and located in the middle of Beira Lake. This feature is so famous today that the whole temple premises are known as Sima Malakaya. In addition a museum, a library, and a residential hall and an alms hall are also in
the premises. 
Kolamba Perahera- pageant of Gangaramaya Raja Maha Viharaya 
Navam Perahera is conducted annually during the month of Navam by the Gangaramaya Raja Maha Viharaya in Colombo to illustrate one of the most prestigious Buddhist historical events. This procession was originally known as Kolamba Perahera. It was the only Buddhist pageant parading the streets of Colombo. It was because of this reason that the perahera was called Kolamba Perahera- the pageant of Colombo. Since it was conducted within the municipal limits of Colombo tens of thousands of spectators including a large number of foreign tourists watch this colourful perahera on both days on which it is conducted. 
Dhamma Caccapavattana Sutta 
Originally Kolamba perahera was conducted in August, immediately after the Sri Dalada Maligawa Esala perahera in the hill capital, Kandy. The occasion for conducting this Perahera was to commemorate the first sermon of Gautama Buddha-Dhamma Caccapavattana Sutta in Isipatanaramaya. However, due to the ill health of the incumbent Thera and a number of other reasons the Perahera could not be
conducted annually. 
The origin of Navam perahera 
In place of Kolamba Esala perahera an annual pageant is conducted during the month of Navam (February) beginning from 1979 with the patronage provided by the then Prime Minister, R.Premadasa. The objectives of the perahera were varied. Primarily it is to venerate the Triple Gem, Buddha, His doctrine Dharma and His disciples Sangha. Another objective is to commemorate the appointment of arahants Sariputra and Moggalyana by the Enlightened One as His chief disciples (Agra Srawake},the top most positions in the Order of Maha Sangha were conferred on Arahant Sariputra (Dakunath Sau) and Arahant Moggalyana (Wamath Sau) by the Enlightened One at the first congregation on Navam full moon poya day after the Enlightenment. The Gangaramaya Navam Perahera comprises a multitude of participants who in union make the
pageant magnificent. 
Whip crackers signalling the main Perahera  
Whip crackers serve a number of purposes. Firstly it is a means of clearing the way for the main Perahera. Spectators confine themselves to the pavement and leave the road entirely for the procession to pass without any disruption. Secondly it is a signal that the main procession is approaching. It is also an offering made by sound indicating the majesty of the procession. It is said that even celestial beings hear this sound which is an invitation for them to watch the procession. Devotees, young and old including school children walk behind them, most of them carrying trays of flowers. 
Elephants provide a majestic look for the procession 
Beautifully adorned elephants including tuskers provide majesty and elegance to the procession. The tusker of the temple carries the relic casket on his back. As in the case of Sri Dalada Maligawa Esala perahera in the hill capital, Kandy, the Kelaniya Raja Maha viharaya Duruthu Perahera,Bellanwila Raja Maha Viharaya Perahera elephants walk elegantly in the Gangaramaya Navam Perahera too. They are adorned in costumes consisting of three parts. The body part, the forehead garland called Netti Malaand ear ornament called Kan Joduwa. Large quantities of padding, rich cloth, velvet, coral etc. are required to make these costumes. Ornaments add to the elegance of the elephants that provide majesty to the perahera. 
Drama performers 
Drama performers in the Gangaramaya Navam Perahera are categorized into four groups. There are ordinary dancing teams representing Kandyan dancers, low country dancers and Sabaragamuwa dancers. The worlds oldest and most ubiquitous musical instrument  the drum- is used in all these dancing performances. Various kinds of drums such as geta beraya drum used in Kandyan dancing), Magulberaya the drum used by the royalty, Yak beraya the drum used in devil dancing, Udakkiya the drum which is small in the middle, and Rabanatam borine are beaten to produce rich and melodious sounds in harmony with dancers and Vannam or songs of the performers . In addition a pair of cymbals or thalampota is used in all these dancing performances to keep it in rhythm through the loud ringing sound made when the two cymbals are hit together. 
Hewisi drummers produce the drum roar 
The most important group is the group of Hewisi drum players. They produce a drum roar with the large drum, Daula, the double drum Thammettamaand the trumpet Horanewa. Meanwhile, conch shell blowers produce gentle and prolonged sounds increasing the serenity of the atmosphere. The rhythm of the drum roar suits the rhythm of any other performers in the procession. 
Vannam or Metrical verses 
Dancers in their costumes look elegant when they move in the procession. They sing Vannams while dancing. Vannams are metrical verses sung by dancers to produce lyrical music in their performances. There are eighteen vannams such as Thuranga (horse) vannama,Vairodi (Cats eye gem) vannama, Savula (cock) vannama and the most important Gajaga (elephant) vannama.When the performers dance to the tune of Gajaga vannama they move just like elephants 
Ves Natuma performance of Kandyan dancers 
A special kind of Kandyan dancing is known as the Vesnatuma. These dancers have to undergo training for a long period of time before they are considered qualified to perform this kind of dance. The performer will be entitled to the Ves or special costume with a beautiful head dress only after being trained well which takes a long time. 
Pantheru dancers who produce a clinging sound 
Pantheru dancers form another group of dancers. Each performer has a circular instrument called Pantheru which produces a clinging sound. This makes the
performance melodious. 
Borukakul Karayo 
Borukakul Karayo Stilt walkers produce special colour to the Gangaramaya Navam perahera. The performers walk high on two long pieces of wood or walking sticks with pieces to rest their feet on . They sneer at the spectators from above and provide them entertainment. 
The organization of the procession 
A significant feature about this procession is that it is planned and organized in an excellent manner. The perahera parades a number of streets and the main road in front of the Gangaramaya viharaya and along the Beira Lake  Navam Mawatha. Seating accommodation is provided for thespecialists. The perahera route is determined and the places where the Maha Sangha, elephants, dancers, drummers, torch bearers , office bearers and others who partake in the pageant are well directed .
Nothing is left for the pageant to
be disorganized. 
The Perahera arrangements are made by the Gangaramaya temple and the entire organization is handled by the young people associated with the temple under the able direction of the chief incumbent of the temple, Venerable Galaboda Gnaneswara Thera- Podi Hammuduruwo.

SL education system is a 'Mongol' - Wijeyadasa
	
Sri Lankas education system is a mongol or a retarded version, Justice and Buddhasasana Minister Wijedasa Rajapaksa said today.
He told Parliament that the system was retarded because while some schools have all the facilities several others are without. When a school is developed by a Provincial Council it is brought under the Central Government, the minister said.
He said the SAITM Medical College in Malabe was critical of doctors as a whole and the GMOA. I went to see a specialist recently and was shocked to see how he was treating patients," the minister said, while highlighting the fact that the doctor was treating nine patients at a time.
I am not saying lawyers are perfect as we have managed to suspend some of them from practicing the profession, he said speaking about his own profession.
The minister criticised the Government Medical Officers' Association (GMOA) saying they are protesting against SAITM taking advantage of the freedom given by the present regime. GMOA was silent like kittens during the tenure of former president Mahinda Rajapaksa," he said adding that it was surprising to see Mr. Rajapaksa saying he was against SAITM.
SAITM was set up during his tenure as president and I dont know whether to cry or laugh at these hilarious jokes, he said.
Joint opposition MP Wimal Weerawansa warned that the SAITM might baloon into dangerous proportions if it was not resolved now. He said it might end up with a killing like the case of Thrimawithane who was killed during the conflict over the Ragama Private Medical College.
Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne said certain GMOA members and leading medical practitioners have become examiners of SAITM though many of the doctors were opposing it. (Yohan Perera)

SL jumps to 3rd place on Global RTI ratings
	
Sri Lanka has achieved the third best strongest legal framework for the Right to Information (RTI) in the Global RTI ratings, the Canadian based RTI watch-dog Centre for Law and Democracy (CLD) announced.
The combined effect of the regulations adopted by the Minister of Parliament Reforms and Mass Media Gayantha Karunatilleke and the Right to Information Commission has added full ten points to Sri Lankas already strong score of 121 points out of a possible total of 150 on the RTI Rating.
Simultaneously, Sri Lanka has become the best in South Asia with 131 points, by passing India at 5th, with 128 points.
Mexico tops the rating with a score of 136 while Serbia is second with 135.
According to CLD its Executive Director Toby Mendel said Countries often go up a few points on the Right to Information Rating when they adopt rules and regulations. But this is an impressive jump up for a country which already had a very strong score. So both the Minister and the Commission deserve to be congratulated for their good work.
Sri Lankas Right to Information Act came into effect on 3 February 2017, just on the deadline for the GRTI ratings, while the gazette notification in relation to the Act was issued on the 21st of January 2017.
Global RTI Rating, a progamme which comparatively assesses the strength of legal frameworks for the RTI from around the world was founded by Access Info Europe (AIE) and the Centre for Law and Democracy (CLD).

Story of the  Chief  Disciples in Buddhism
	
In the delegation of authority, seniority and discipline, were not the only criteria taught on Nawam Poya.
The aspirants of asceticism, initially, were ordained by the Buddha Himself. As the sangha community grew, the Buddha introduced the principles of delegation and requested the members of the Maha Sangha to ordain the candidates. The most significant incident that took place on Navam Poya Day was the appointment of two chief disciples, Sariputta and Moggallana. 
The Exalted One with his divine eye saw what the dejected senior monks were reflecting upon and explained to them the suitability of those two appointments. In order to clarify his stand the Buddha explained that seniority was not the only decisive factor or qualification that had been considered in making those two key appointments. The Buddhas discourse, Ovada Prathimoksha, helped monks to develop self-discipline. The above three principles are crucial features in modern management 
The other significant incident that took place on Navam Poya Day was the holding of the first ever Buddhist congregation. On the first Navam Full Moon Poya Day after the Enlightenment of Gauthama Buddha, there were a large number of disciples in the Order of the Maha Sangha. Although there had been no problems until then the Enlightened One would have expected incidents of breach of behaviour and morality when the Sangha society grew in numbers. 
This enabled them to go into priesthood when and where they wished. The Buddha will intervene if they needed any clarifications and advice. As mentioned, the appointment of Sariputta and Moggallana as the two  Aggrasavaka took place on Navam Poya. Sariputta was appointed to the prestigious position of Dharmasenadipathi and Moggallana as Dharmapurohita respectively. There were discussions as to why some of the senior monks were overlooked in making these important appointments. To clear all misgivings of the monks, the Enlightened One, related the exciting story woven round Sariyuth and Mugalan in their previous birth during the time of Anomadassi Buddha. The Arahat Sariputta born during the time of Anomadassi was known as Sarada. He inherited massive wealth and became a good Samaritan who distributed wealth among the poor. Through meditation, he gained Attasamapatti - eight attainments. Sarada had a close friend by the name of Siriwardena. Buddha Anomadassi preached to him. At the end of that sermon, except Sarada, all attained Arahatship. Saradas goal was to be become a chief disciple of Gautama Buddha. Anomadassi Buddha gave Sarada the assurance that he would be one of the chief disciples of Gautama Buddha. His friend Siriwardena too presented alms to Anomadassi Buddha, and aspired for the second position of chief disciple. 
The First Congregation
On Navam Full Moon Day, the first Buddhist congregation was held, under the auspicies of Maha Kassapa Thera who looked much like the Buddha. In modern management ethics, discipline play an essential role. Vinaya or discipline as taught by the Buddha two thousand five hundred years ago and established with the first Buddhist Congregation which was held at Veluwanaramaya, Rajagaha discussed an important discourse in Buddhism. They are Ovada Prathimoksha, meaning to give advice. Through this, one develops self-discipline. Buddha delivered the sermon on Ovada Prathimoksha to Sariputta and Moggallana on Navam Poya Day. It is believed that at the First Council, Upali Thera recited the vinaya while Ananda Thera recited the suttra. 
Cycles of Birth, Death and Rebirth in Buddhism and science
Buddhism speaks of cycles of birth, death and rebirth beyond time immemorial, [over Kalpas or eons]; from Anomadassi to Gauthama Buddha. 
Religion is essentially spiritual and associated with the mind, where as scientific theories are based purely on material and non-spiritual stands. Though they are at the opposite ends of the spectrum, both relate to the well being of the human race. However, Buddhism, which is based not on belief but on rationality, is always complemented by scientific theories.

The Buddha saw the impermanence of lifenot only in life, but of everything in the universe. Even the universe is subject to this rule, Sabbe Sankara Anicca  All component things are transient. This is the message that the Buddha has proclaimed that everything is changing in the universe where everything moves from one mode to another. This transition is realised only when one gets familiar with it in the evening of life. The cycle of birth, death and rebirth, a process that is in itself the best example. Birth intermingled with joy and sorrow, grief, pain, old age, despair, disease and death; again followed by rebirth in some corner in the universe according to ones kamma. 
The term Dhamma stands for the ethical and philosophical teachings of the Buddha. It means, come and see - Eahi Passiko and not just accept it as true. Buddhism id not a religion. I declare to you the Dhamma  in the parable of the raft, not for you to own and keep it in your possession, but utilise it as a tool to cross the stream of suffering, The Buddha said.  As scientific exploration continue to unravel the secrets of nature the Dhamma could be expected to benefit from them. In the Dhamma, as in science there is a fundamental unwillingness to accept the existence of an Almighty as the Creator of the universe. The concept of cause and effect is at variance with the concept of God. This truth is universally applicable like the Law of Gravity. Something cannot be made out of nothing; only from something can another thing be made. This universal truth or rationality is used in the question of our beginning -the origin of universe that leads to the Big Bang that is now widely considered as the only credible alternative to creation by an omnipotent God. Our universe, matter, energy and time began with that momentous event. The universe is now going through its expanding stage having already survived for about fourteen billion years, under impulsion of the incalculable energy produced at the big bang. The current belief among Astro-physicists is that the universe is envisaged to expand for a few more billion years. 
The world has been changing so rapidly the disparity between subject and object is fast fading. Everything is interconnected and interdependent between all living matter and the which are vital for our existence. In this era of rapid communications, with satellite and electronic equipments like the Internet in particular, the processes carried out in one part of the world, affects the rest of the whole world. We could attach another dimension to this system of propagation and that would be the quantum dimension. Long before the arrival of mass communications, quantum effect had been answerable for the spread of wishes of thoughts, among people. We live engrossed in force fields, of minuscule particles moving around the universe and through us at the speed of 183,000 miles per second [speed of light]. These undetectable forces carry impulses of our thoughts to long distances depending on their strengths and volume; they are bound to influence our way of thinking and judgment over a period of time. 
Thought is the most powerful single force that we possess. If the majority were to send out impulses of thoughts of loving kindness, compassion and sympathetic joy, eventually all minds of human beings will be affected, and the fundamental shift in thinking, currently taking place, will be reinforced to achieve a lasting peace for all. 
Agganna Sutta explains it all
In the second part of the Agganna Sutta, the Buddha relates how living beings came to reside on the planet Earth. The Buddha said that after a long lapse of time, the universe shrinks or contracts. At such times, beings are mostly born in the Abhassara Brahma world, and they dwell there feeding on delight. They are mind-made, self-luminous and move through the air. They live and exist like that for a very long periods. But sooner or later, the universe begins to expand again. During that time of expansion, the beings from the Abhassara Brahma world, after ending their lives are mostly reborn in this world. Here they dwell, feeding on delight, mind-made, self-luminous, moving through the air.And they continue like that for a very long period floating above and around the planets. At this time, the Moon and the Sun will not be visible, no night and day, no names and identity, no divisions based on race, caste religion; not even female or male: just creatures. 
May all beings be happy!

TPC wants Int'l probe on war crimes allegations
	
Amid speculation that the Government hoped to request the UNHRC for more time to implement its resolution, the Northern Province Chief Minister C. V. Wigneswaran-led Tamil Peoples Council (TPC) comprising Tamil political parties and civil society groups said Sri Lankan should not be given any more time.
In a resolution adopted at the Eluga Thamil rally held in Batticaloa yesterday, the TPC called for an international investigation into what it described as, the genocidal crimes perpetrated against the Tamil people'.
Reiterating that the North and East is the traditional homeland of the Tamils, the TPC said the distinct socio-cultural and political identity of the Tamil nation could only be guaranteed and safeguarded by setting up a non-divided, autonomous unit of self-government in the North and East and that this was nonnegotiable.
The TPC said it the construction of Buddhist temples in the North and the East must be stopped.
The Tamil people have repeatedly and firmly rejected a domestic accountability mechanism to investigate crimes perpetrated on them. In his September 2015 statement, the UN Human Rights Commissioner Zeid Hussein categorically stated that Sri Lankas judiciary is incapable of investigating crimes committed during the war. Against this backdrop, the resolution passed in September 2015 at the United Nations Human Rights Commission suggested a hybrid mechanism to investigate these crimes. Yet, the Sri Lankan Government, which co- sponsored this resolution with other international stakeholders, has now reiterated that it would not be amenable to the participation of foreign judges in the accountability mechanism. It has rejected a hybrid mechanism and has suggested a domestic accountability mechanism. The Government has now requested for more time to establish this mechanism, the TPC said. (Kelum Bandara)

Trump writes to Chinas Xi
	

U.S. President Donald Trump has broken the ice with Chinese President Xi Jinping in a letter that said he looked forward to working with him to develop relations, although the pair havent spoken directly since Trump took office. 
The letter thanked Xi for his congratulatory note on Trumps inauguration and wished the Chinese people a prosperous Lunar New Year of the Rooster, the White House said in a statement on Wednesday. 
President Trump stated that he looks forward to working with President Xi to develop a constructive relationship that benefits both the United States and China, it said. 
Trump and Xi have yet to speak directly since Trump took office on Jan. 20, although they did talk soon after Trump won the U.S. presidential election in November.  In a seperate report CNN said that since his election, Trump had challenged Beijing over a range of issues -- slamming its military build-up in the South China Sea, its currency and trade policies and, perhaps most controversially, upending decades of diplomatic protocol by questioning a longstanding US policy towards Taiwan. 
On Thursday, the widely read Global Times tabloid, published by the ruling Communist Partys official Peoples Daily, noted that Trump had not immediately confronted China as had been expected, because he had realized upsetting Beijing would backfire badly. 
CNN added as Trump reached out to Beijing, it was confirmed that Russian President Vladimir Putin would meet with Xi in May on the sidelines of a major economic summit, according to Russian state media.

US appeals court upholds suspension
	
A federal appeals court refused Thursday to reinstate President Donald Trump's ban on travelers from seven predominantly Muslim nations, dealing another legal setback to the new administration's immigration policy.
In a unanimous decision, the panel of three judges from the San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals declined to block a lower-court ruling that suspended the ban and allowed previously barred travelers to enter the U.S. An appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court is possible.
The court rejected the administration's claim that it did not have the authority to review the president's executive order.
"There is no precedent to support this claimed unreviewability, which runs contrary to the fundamental structure of our constitutional democracy," the court said.
U.S. District Judge James Robart in Seattle issued a temporary restraining order halting the ban last week after Washington state and Minnesota sued. The ban temporarily suspended the nation's refugee program and immigration from countries that have raised terrorism concerns.
Justice Department lawyers appealed to the 9th Circuit, arguing that the president has the constitutional power to restrict entry to the United States and that the courts cannot second-guess his determination that such a step was needed to prevent terrorism.
The states said Trump's travel ban harmed individuals, businesses and universities. Citing Trump's campaign promise to stop Muslims from entering the U.S., they said the ban unconstitutionally blocked entry to people based on religion.
Both sides faced tough questioning during an hour of arguments Tuesday conducted by phone  an unusual step  and broadcast live on cable networks, newspaper websites and social media. It attracted a huge audience.
The judges hammered away at the administration's claim that the ban was motivated by terrorism fears, but they also challenged the states' argument that it targeted Muslims.
"I have trouble understanding why we're supposed to infer religious animus when, in fact, the vast majority of Muslims would not be affected," Judge Richard Clifton, a George W. Bush nominee, asked an attorney representing Washington state and Minnesota.
Only 15 percent of the world's Muslims are affected by the executive order, the judge said, citing his own calculations.
"Has the government pointed to any evidence connecting these countries to terrorism" Judge Michelle T. Friedland, who was appointed by President Barack Obama, asked the Justice Department attorney.
The lower-court judge temporarily halted the ban after determining that the states were likely to win the case and had shown that the ban would restrict travel by their residents, damage their public universities and reduce their tax base. Robart put the executive order on hold while the lawsuit works its way through the courts.
After that ruling, the State Department quickly said people from the seven countries  Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen  with valid visas could travel to the U.S. The decision led to tearful reunions at airports round the country.
During his remarks at a law enforcement conference, Trump said the courts blocking his divisive immigration order "seem to be so political."
Trump's own Supreme Court pick, Neil Gorsuch, finds the president's comments about the judicial branch "disheartening" and "demoralizing," a spokeswoman for the nomination confirmation team told NBC News on Wednesday.
The Supreme Court has a vacancy, and there's no chance Gorsuch, will be confirmed in time to take part in any consideration of the ban.
The ban was set to expire in 90 days, meaning it could run its course before the court would take up the issue. The administration also could change the executive order, including changing its scope or duration.
The judges noted that the states had raised serious allegations about religious discrimination.
Following news of the ruling, Trump tweeted, "See you in court, the security of our nation is at stake!" (cnbc)

US officials stop vetting Nauru refugees for resettlement
	

CANBERRA, Australia (AP/Daily Mail) /9 February 2017 - U.S. officials stopped screening refugees for potential resettlement in the United States this week but will return to the Pacific atoll of Nauru to continue working toward a deal that President Donald Trump has condemned as dumb, an Australian minister said Thursday. 
Immigration Minister Peter Dutton would not say when U.S. Department of Homeland Security officials would return to Nauru to conduct what Trump describes as extreme vetting. 
Trump made enhanced screening a condition for agreeing to honor an Obama administration deal to accept up to 1,250 refugees refused entry into Australia. Australia pays Nauru and Papua New Guinea to keep more than 2,000 asylum seekers  mostly from Iran, Afghanistan and Sri Lanka  in conditions condemned by rights groups.

NAIROBI AFP /Feb9, 2017- Kenyas High Court on Thursday blocked the governments decision to close the Dadaab refugee camp -- the worlds largest -- and force Somali refugees to return home. 
Judge John Mativo ruled that the plan to shut down the camp was unconstitutional, violated Kenyas international obligations and amounted to persecution of refugees. 
Dadaab is home to some 256,000 people, the vast majority of them Somalis who fled across the border following the outbreak of civil war in 1991. 
The government unilaterally decided to close the camp in May last year, saying it was a terrorist training ground for Shabaab Islamist militants.
