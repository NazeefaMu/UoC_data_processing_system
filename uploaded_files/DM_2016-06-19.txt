Gammanpila, first victim of govt.s political hunt: Wimal
	
The National Freedom Front (NFF) Leader and Opposition MP Wimal Weerawansa today interpreted MP Udaya Gammanpila, who was on Saturday arrested and remanded, as the first victim of the governments political mission to hunt leaders of the Joint Opposition.
While condemning Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) Leader Gammanpilas arrest on behalf of the Joint Opposition, he said it was a planned act and alleged the arrest was made on a false complaint over an incident happened seventeen years ago.
He said the government has begun its hunting mission of those who oppose the government.
This anti-public government has weakened the national security in the country while creating a healthy atmosphere for separatism to raise its head again. On the other hand, the economy of the country is falling down and a heavy tax burden has been leveled on the public. A strong opposition against the government has already formed in the country. Therefore, the government is attempting to silence the opposition leaders who are leading the anti-government campaign with the people, MP Weerawansa said.
He further said that Opposition Leaders like MP Udaya Gammanpila were educating the public about the possible dangerous situation which the country will be facing and that was why the government has attempted to prevent him.
He also called all the parties and individuals who are on the side of democracy to rally together against the political hunt. (Piyumi Fonseka)

Police regret STF Commandant's outburst; disciplinary action to be taken
	
While expressing regrets to the media over the threats made by the Special Task Force (STF) Commandant, DIG Ranjith Perera, SSP Ajith Rohana yesterday said disciplinary action would be taken against DIG Perera.
In a special news conference last Friday (17) at STF headquarters DIG Perera said that STF that overcame the underworld, knew how to punish journalists, whom he claims, had fallen into the hands of underworld gangsters and mafia members, while slinging mud at the STF.
DIG Perera blasted out at the media for not commending and acknowledging the STF's contribution in the last week's largest cocaine bust.
However, SSP Ajitha Rohana said the Sri Lanka Police or the STF had no intention to punish the media or threaten them, and the DIG Pereras statement should not be considered as a common statement representing the STF.
He said under Inspector General of Police Pujith Jayasundaras directions, necessary disciplinary actions would be taken against DIG Perera soon. (Indika Ramanayake)

Shaminda Erangas bowling action found to be illegal: ICC
	
The International Cricket Council today announced that an independent assessment has found the bowling action of Sri Lankas Shaminda Eranga to be illegal and, as such, the fast bowler has been suspended from bowling in international cricket with immediate effect.

The assessment revealed that all deliveries exceeded the 15 degrees level of tolerance permitted under the regulations.

Eranga was reported after the second Test against England at Chester-le-Street on 31 May 2016.

In accordance with Article 6.1 of the regulations, Erangas international suspension will also be recognised and enforced by all National Cricket Federations for domestic cricket events played in their own jurisdiction, save that, with the consent of Sri Lanka Cricket, Eranga may be able to play in domestic cricket events played in Sri Lanka under the auspices of Sri Lanka Cricket.

The player can apply for a re-assessment after modifying his bowling action in accordance with clause 2.4 of the Regulations for the Review of Bowlers Reported with Suspected Illegal Bowling Actions.

The test was performed on 6 June at the National Cricket Performance Centre in Loughborough, which is an ICC accredited testing centre.
