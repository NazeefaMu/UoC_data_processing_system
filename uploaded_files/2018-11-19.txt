UNP MP Ajith P. Perera told a media briefing that those MPs who have brought chilly powder and water into the House and those who damaged properties inside the chamber should be penalized.
?Action could be taken against the penal code against MPs who threw chilly power and water at others and those who damaged properties inside the chamber.

This was expressed by Mr. Perera at the briefing last morning. nts in the House during the last few days which including throwing chilly powder and bringing in knives inside the chambers.

## Title: Avoiding Repugnancy the need of the hour to protect Sovereignty

Avoiding Repugnancy the need of the hour to protect Sovereignty
	
?
overeignty in broad terms means supreme power or authority. National sovereignty accordingly, is the autonomy or the independence of a State based on this supreme power or authority. In history wars were fought to preserve sovereignty of nations and sometimes to make sovereign nations subservient or to break them up. When sovereignty is lost, as has been our experience, it often takes several centuries to recover such lost sovereignty.
When force of arms was used against the sovereignty our Country we have exercised the sovereign right to defend ourselves.?
In our recent history, such an attempt to violate our sovereignty by means of terrorism was defeated at a tremendous human and material cost to our nation. In a situation where some individuals in society seem to have forgotten the miserable circumstances we were placed in during a time where our Sovereignty was under the constant threat of terrorism,? it is pertinent to examine how our Constitution has put in place mechanisms to protect our sovereignty and to see whether we understand the value of preserving it.
?
"If the proviso to Article to 70(1) remains a mere proviso, the effect of which can? be limited to situations where Parliament requests its dissolution from the President, this repugnancy is cured. Does the law permit such interpretations? It does for very practical reasons such as the present situation faced by our Country"
A Judgment of 7 Judges reported in (2002) 3 SLR at page 85 settles the Law in respect of 3 matters.
1.The dissolution of Parliament is part of the exercise of executive power vested in the President.( at page 104 )
2.Such power cannot be alienated, in that, it cannot be removed from the President and be vested in the Parliament.
3.The restriction of that power can be done up to a maximum of half the period of Parliament and if a restriction is placed beyond half, it would amount to alienation and therefore, such a restriction would violate the inalienable sovereign executive power of the people set out in Articles 3 read with 4(b).( page106)?
This Judgment binds the Supreme Court and any interpretation of the Constitution has to be done necessarily in line with this Judgment. Some claim erroneously the present provision to Article 70(1) introduced by the 19th amendment, restricts the power of dissolution of Parliament vested in the President beyond half the term of Parliament?s elected time. If so interpreted it would be a clear violation of Article 3 as interpreted in the Judgment. In that light, how does one interpret the effect of proviso of Article 70(1)?
In fact the 19th Amendment accepts the position that the power of the President to dissolve Parliament is with the President since Article 33(2)(c), Article 62(2), Article 70(1) and Article 70(3) all refer to the Parliament being dissolved by the President. It is the proviso to Article 70(1) that seems to seek to place a restriction on this power. There will be a repugnancy between this proviso and the power of the President given in the other Articles including Article 70(1), when read with Articles 3 and? 4(b), if interpreted in this manner. The only method sovereign executive power vested in the President on trust can be alienated and be vested in Parliament is by following provisions of the Constitution and having a referendum. This is because Article 3 is an entrenched Article in terms of Article 83 and such can be removed only by the consent given by the people at a referendum. We all know such a referendum was never held.
?
"If the President attempts to violate the will of the people after an election, which again would be a violation of their franchise by exercising a power given to him arbitrarily, such can be restrained by the method of a fundamental rights application which is now provided? in the 19th Amendment"
?
The question that arises then is this. As a literal reading of the proviso to Article 70(1) is clearly repugnant to all Articles relating to dissolution,? including Article 71 when read with Article 3 and 4(b) , as interpreted by the Supreme Court, what should be done about it? As mentioned earlier, the right of dissolution of Parliament is clearly accepted by all to be a part of the executive power of the people vested in the President in trust and is not alienable.?
Therefore, all the Articles related to dissolution of Parliament found in the Constitution, including the presently amended Article 70(1), refers to the President dissolving Parliament.? Legislation cannot by implication repeal an entrenched Clause, particularly when that entrenched Clause is the very heart of the Constitution.?
Therefore, since a mere proviso in Article 70(1) is being attempted to be interpreted in a manner repugnant to Article 3, a method must be found to prevent this proviso, overwhelming the heart of the Constitution which is Article 3.?
If the proviso to Article to 70(1) remains a mere proviso, the effect of which can? be limited to situations where Parliament requests its dissolution from the President, this repugnancy is cured. Does the law permit such interpretations? It does for very practical reasons such as the present situation faced by our Country. Maxwell, suggests some simple legal means of avoiding repugnancy.
One way given in the 1976 Edition of Maxwell ? Interpretation of Statutes page 187 paragraph 2 is as follows;
??one way in which repugnancy can be avoided is by regarding two apparently conflicting provisions as dealing with distinct matters or situations?
If this Rule is applied, the matter can be resolved. If Parliament wishes to have itself dissolved within 4 ? years,? it can make a request to the President in terms of the proviso to Article 70(1) and the President may, since it is his prerogative, at his discretion, allow such dissolution.
The provisions of the Constitution, which gives the President the power of Dissolution -namely, Article 33(2)(c), which was introduced for the 1st time by the 19th Amendment itself , Article 62(2) , Article 70(3) and even Article 70(1) without the proviso could be considered as giving ample authority to the President to dissolve Parliament irrespective of a request by Parliament.? This interpretation would avoid the repugnant nature? of the proviso to Article 70(1).
If one reads Maxwell further, the Construction of provisos is also explained in a very simple way at page 189 last paragraph of the same book as follows;
??It will, however, generally be found that inconsistencies can be avoided by applying the general Rule that the words of a proviso are not to be taken ?absolutely in their strict literal sense?, but that a proviso is ?of necessity?. limited in its operation to the ambit of the section which it qualifies?
The said paragraph in Maxwell continues as follows;? ?so far as that section itself is concerned, the proviso again receives a restricted construction: where the section confers power, it would be contrary to ?ordinary operation of a proviso to give it an effect which would cut down those powers beyond what compliance with the proviso renders necessary?
?
"The provisions of the Constitution, which gives the President the power of Dissolution -namely, Article 33(2)(c), which was introduced for the 1st time by the 19th Amendment itself , Article 62(2) , Article 70(3) and even Article 70(1) without the proviso could be considered as giving ample authority to the President to dissolve Parliament irrespective of a request by Parliament.? This interpretation would avoid the repugnant nature? of the proviso to Article 70(1). "
?
Therefore, applying these rules of construction the proviso to Article 70(1) will be contained and? it will be prevented from being repugnant to Article 3 of the Constitution, which is the heart of the Constitution.This can be done until Parliament removes? the repugnancy with an intelligent approach in the future.
The present act of dissolution can be easily justified legally since the 19th Amendment has been drawn in such an inept manner that it leaves room for perfectly legal and imaginative interpretations.?
The entire Constitution should be read subject to the over - arching principles set out in Article 3 read with Article 4. This is because the people have vested their sovereign power? in trust on the President and Parliament separately as explained in Article 4(a) and (b).? ?
Article 70(3) after the 19th amendment stands separated from the present proviso to Article 70(1) regarding the right of dissolution vested with the President and cannot be read together with that? proviso introduced by the 19th amendment as far as the new restrictions imposed by the same are concerned.? This is because Section 5(2) of the interpretation Ordinance only talks of every amending enactment ?having to be read as one with the ?principal enactment??. The part of the Principal enactment that was not touched by the amendment need not therefore be read with the amendment as far as the reduced powers are concerned.
The effect of Article 3 is clearly that alienation of Executive power vested in the President is not possible without the sanction of the people at a referendum in terms of Article 83.
?Whatever amendment that has been brought has not removed Article 3 of the Constitution which is the inalienable sovereign power of the people as settled by Law which says once the executive power of dissolution is reposed in the President, it cannot be removed and handed over to another arm of Government without the sanction of the people at a referendum.??
Of course the question then remains what would a President do and what could a President do under these circumstances if the law is interpreted to mean that he can dissolve Parliament at any time.
The remedy fortunately is available under the present 19th Amendment itself in terms of Article 35 read with Article 126 as an arbitrary or unreasonable exercise of Executive action of the President is subject to the fundamental rights Jurisdiction of the Supreme Court.?
?
"If one reads Maxwell further, the Construction of provisos is also explained in a very simple way at page 189 last paragraph of the same book"
?
If the President attempts to violate the will of the people after an election, which again would be a violation of their franchise by exercising a power given to him arbitrarily, such can be restrained by the method of a fundamental rights application which is now provided? in the 19th Amendment.
That is a question that can be looked at if and when such a situation arises. However, for the present, the essential necessity is to ensure that the inalienable sovereignty of the people preserved for very good reasons by able men of the past? is not alienated by implication due to the absence of such ability in those responsible for legislation in the present era.

?Cabinet stands dissolved when NCM against Govt. is passed?  -Legal Expert
	
?
?
Rajeev Amarasuriya is an Attorney-at-Law in practice in the area of public law before the Superior Courts. He is a Fellow Member of the Chartered Institute of Management Accountants (CIMA - UK), and an Alumnus of both the Faculty of Law of the University of Colombo and the Harvard Kennedy School of Government, Executive Education.?
Q? The Speaker has informed the President that Parliament has passed a vote of no-confidence in the Government. What is the effect of a no-confidence motion being passed against the Government ?
Article 48(2) of the Constitution provides that the Cabinet of Ministers shall stand dissolved, when Parliament passes a vote of no-confidence in the Government. This Article goes on to provide that the President shall, in such a situation appoint a Prime Minister, Ministers of the Cabinet of Ministers and other Non-Cabinet and Deputy Ministers.? ?
Q??In a period of transition, between one government to another, what is the effect on the system of public administration?
A reading of Article 48(2) of the Constitution casts a duty upon the President to appoint a new Prime Minister and a new Cabinet of Ministers, upon the dissolution of the Cabinet of Ministers. Given the affectation such a transition would have on the entire administrative structure of governance, it would seem that this duty to appoint would require to be effected forthwith, without much of a time gap. Therefore, there would be a quick transition, and there would be less dislocation to the system.? ?
?
"During a period of transition and until the appointment of a new Cabinet of Ministers and Permanent Secretaries, the decision making, supervision and reporting structure of the Public Service and the other institutions and statutory bodies would be severely hampered"
Q??What if there is such a delay, between the dissolution of the previous Cabinet of Ministers and the appointment of a new Prime Minister and Cabinet of Ministers? How does it affect administrative structure?
It would be unfortunate if such a situation did arise. I say this because the entire administrative structure comes down from the Cabinet of Ministers, which the President chairs. As you are aware, the system of Government is structured with the Cabinet of Ministers at the top, then the Line Ministries, and reporting to the Line Ministries are the Departments, Institutions and other statutory bodies.? ?
A Permanent Secretary to a Ministry is the Chief Accounting Officer of the Ministry and all Departments, Institutions and other statutory bodies come under such Permanent Secretary.? ?
Article 52(3) of the Constitution provides that a Secretary to a Ministry shall cease to hold office upon the dissolution of the Cabinet of Ministers, so in such a case, the person holding office as the Secretary to the Ministry would cease to hold such office which will then become vacant.? ?
During a period of transition and until the appointment of a new Cabinet of Ministers and Permanent Secretaries, the decision making, supervision and reporting structure of the Public Service and the other institutions and statutory bodies would be severely hampered.? ?
?
"The general principle is that it is the duty of a Public Servant to resist unlawful orders, and there is further authority that even if given in writing, an illegal order would not exonerate a Public Servant from liability under the law. This is on the presumption that Public Officers are firstly servants of the people and not their administrative superiors"
Q??Why is the role of the Permanent Secretary so important in the system of administration?
As you know, in terms of Article 148 of the Constitution, Parliament has full control of public finance.? ?
Chapter III of the Financial Regulations makes it the duty of the Finance Minister to account to Parliament on all receipts and payments. In view of the need to nominate officers for the collection and disbursement of public funds on behalf of the Minister of Finance, Chapter III makes further provision for the Finance Minister to appoint the Secretary to each Ministry as the Chief Accounting Officer of the Ministry and the responsibility for the supervision of departmental financial transactions.? ?
The Financial Regulations therefore enable and give effect to the Constitutional duty of every Secretary, subject to the control and direction of the Minister, to exercise supervision over the departments and other institutions coming under its purview. The new National Audit Act also mirrors these provisions. This is how the Secretary becomes pivotal to the functioning of the administration.? ?
Q??How does there being no Cabinet of Ministers affect other officers in the Public Service?
If there is no functioning Cabinet of Ministers and the Ministry Secretaries cease to hold office, the remaining Public Service is placed in a most precarious position.? ?
?Fundamentally, there is no reporting structure in place, and this is especially so in respect of financial matters. This is because, as I said before, there is a structure of delegation from the Finance Minister to the Chief Accounting Officers and then to the Heads of Department.? ?
?Even the Establishments Code at Chapter 27 provides for the Channels of Communication of Government Policy from the Cabinet of Ministers, to the Secretaries and through them to the Heads of Department. Without a Cabinet of Ministers there would not be any approved policy and in any event, without a Secretary, there would be no room for implementation of the same.? ?
So in such a situation there will necessarily be a breakdown in the Public Service.? ?
?
"There are many repercussions when Public Officers follow unlawful orders, and there appears to be consistent treatment and approach to the same in most jurisdictions"
Q??What if a dissolved Cabinet of Ministers continue to sit and make Orders, can Public Servants refuse to follow orders?
As I stated before, even the Secretaries to Ministries by operation of law cease to hold office when the Cabinet is dissolved.So it would not be practical for orders to be communicated to other officers, so this would not arise.? ?
?Also, it is clear in terms of the principles of Public Law that nothing would flow from a body that ceases to have lawful authority or jurisdiction.? ?
The Financial Regulations at Regulation 156 also provides that an Officer shall be held personally responsible to the Government if he/she allows or directs any action to be performed without proper authority.? ?
?The Supreme Court in the Case of M.N.D. Perera V. Balapatabendi among other things held that even a directive from the President cannot be a defence if it was manifestly and obviously illegal.? ?
Q??What are the repercussions when Public Officers follow unlawful orders? Do the Constitutional provisions apply to Public Officers as well??
Article 28 of the Constitution provides that it is the duty of every person in Sri Lanka to uphold and defend the Constitution and the Law; further national interest and to preserve and protect public property and to combat misuse and waste of public property.? ?
Chapter II of the Establishments Code requires all persons appointed to the Public Service to make and subscribe to the oath in the 7th Schedule to the Constitution which specifically requires stating that the officer shall uphold and defend the Constitution. So I think that would answer the second part of the question.? ?
There are many repercussions when Public Officers follow unlawful orders, and there appears to be consistent treatment and approach to the same in most jurisdictions.? ?
?The general principle is that it is the duty of a Public Servant to resist unlawful orders, and there is further authority that even if given in writing, an illegal order would not exonerate a Public Servant from liability under the law. This is on the presumption that Public Officers are firstly servants of the people and not their administrative superiors.? ?
?
"As you know, in terms of Article 148 of the Constitution, Parliament has full control of public finance"
The Establishments Code at Clause 8.1. requires all Public Servants to adhere to the provisions of the Establishments Code and Financial Regulations, and failure to do so amounts to an offence under the First Schedule. It is pertinent that there is specific provision that no plea by an officer would be entertained on the basis that such officer was under pressure by any other officer or authority not to adhere to the relevant provisions.? ?
?The non-allegiance to the Constitution is also listed as an offence in the first Schedule of the Establishments Code containing the list of offences committed by Public Officers. Acting or causing to act in such manner as to bring the country into disrepute is another listed offence.? ?
Lord Denning in the Lazarus Estate Case once remarked that : ?No judgment of a court, no order of a Minister, can be allowed to stand if it had been obtained by fraud?.
?
"If there is no functioning Cabinet of Ministers and the Ministry Secretaries cease to hold office, the remaining Public Service is placed in a most precarious position"
Q??Can a Public Officer who follows unlawful orders be charged under the Bribery and Corruption Act?
That is an interesting proposition. Section 70 of the Bribery Commission Act which defines Corruption is very wide in scope. It brings within its ambit unlawful loss to the Government or an unlawful benefit to any person. Section 70 further provides that even though there is no intent, knowledge of the same would be sufficient to perpetrate the offence.?
So in response to the question, there may be situations where there can be prosecutions under the offence of corruption.

Any setback in the functioning of its equipment is certain to incur severe losses ? losses that with the right technology, can be significantly curtailed. One of the critical issues related to factory equipment in the apparel trade, is the efficient management and identification of its machines.?
Although the exchange of machinery between facilities - on a ?loan? or ?rental? basis- is a common practice across the industry, there has never been an efficient mode of automating and optimising these processes to productively monitor these movements. As a result of poor asset management, the production facility is at risk of incurring phenomenal expenses, effectively holding back the entire business with this loss. Res.Q|MI? is designed specifically to cater to such scenarios in any factory environment; facilitating the easy tracking of machinery -with just a click of a button- irrespective of where the machine is located at the time.
Guests at the Res.Q Machine Inventory launch observe information provided by the asset management solution?
Each machine is assigned a specific uniquely identifiable NFC tag which contains information, from the machine?s unique ID, its transaction history, break downs and service records. The machine management solution includes smart notifications, rent-in and rent-out calculations, as well as complete visibility of available machinery, allowing for manufacturers to exhaust all available machinery before resorting to renting machinery. With Res.Q Machine Inventory, facilities will be automatically notified once a machine has completed its rental time period.
Res.Q Machine Inventory also aids the commerce of the apparel industry with machine maintenance, for manufacturers can now ensure that their machinery is functioning at its optimal performance and also monitor a detailed record of its maintenance and service history of every machine.
In order to further ensure that all machinery is consistently functioning at its optimal performance -and with minimum down time-, Res.Q |MI is designed to give production facilities complete visibility of all available machinery. The system instantly notifies the relevant personnel as soon as a machine is detected as offline, allowing for the manufacturing facility to track the issue and take immediate corrective action.
Repair work for every machine is updated to the system via a mobile application paired with the NFC tag, and as a result a comprehensive record of the service and maintenance history -including spare part management- of each machine is monitored and immediately accessible.?
Another responsibility factory managers bear is the tedious task of manually managing needle supply to each machine or operator. Res.Q |MI?s in-built ?Needle Management Module? helps manufacturers address these issues, from needle management to needle issuing at the shop floor. This NFC technology-based module helps facilities streamline the needle monitoring process by recognising each machine and operator with unique ID tags, systematically recording each authorisation and bringing forth visibility to the entire process in real-time.??
H One replicates a factory floor setting at the launch of Res.Q Machine Inventory
At the launch of this cutting-edge machinery management solution, key stakeholders and potential investors were introduced to the many benefits of this effective and paperless new technology, and H One once again proved its mettle as the country?s primary innovative technology solutions provider, by once again serving the industry with yet another unified, integrated cloud solution for strategic IT modernisation aligned with the emerging needs of the business.?
?The key to any IT service is to make it easy for clients to have access to information which may otherwise involve a tedious process to accumulate,? said H One Chief Executive Officer, Samath Fernando at the launch. ?This is exactly why we designed Res.Q Machine Inventory: an all-in-one solution for factory maintenance, enabling precision in tracking and maintenance with enhanced flexibility so that they can manage their machinery requirements on-site, which ultimately allows for well-informed, and intelligent decision-making.??
Since its establishment in 2008 -as a progression from the Hirdaramani Group legacy spanning over 120 years- H One has become the forerunner in business intelligence solutions. The firm is a Microsoft Tier One Partner, Gold Cloud Productivity Partner and a top-ranked Microsoft Large Account Reseller serving the largest number of Enterprise Agreement customers in Sri Lanka. In both 2016 and 2018 H One was recognised as Microsoft Country Partner of the Year for Sri Lanka, in addition to winning O365 Partner every consecutively year since 2013.
The launch of Res.Q Machine Inventory is the newest addition to its solutions portfolio following the release of the resourceful QMS (Quality Management System) just last year. Staying true to its commitment to servicing the industry with innovation in apparel manufacturing with its business intelligence capabilities, H One also has plans to release a Skill Profiling tool to track employee performance, and hopes to serve markets beyond the region as well.

In conversation with CSI expert Ravi Perera : Will Sri Lanka have any  wildlife in future?
	
Ravi with the last remaining Northern White rhino Sudan before its death?<U+200B>
?
Crimes are an everyday occurrence. Crime scene investigations have often been vested with the Police but in the West, it is serious business. It would take years or even a lifetime for one to be qualified as a Crime Scene Investigator. Completing his 25th year in forensics and crime scene investigations is Ravi Perera, a Sri Lankan living in California, USA. Ravi has been one of the 12 individuals who were selected to follow training at the Forensic Academy of the Federal Bureau of Investigation in Quantico, Virginia. While solving crimes related to humans, Ravi has quite interestingly extended his expertise to solving wildlife crimes, especially at his work base in Kenya. As such, Ravi is also the founder of the Serendipity Wildlife Foundation which is an organisation that provides assistance in wildlife forensics and investigations. Ravi also has plans to extend his operations to Sri Lanka in the near future.??
In an interview with the Daily Mirror during a recent visit to Sri Lanka, Ravi shared his experience in the field of forensics and about lessons we can learn from Kenya.? ?
Excerpts:? ?
Q? ?Why are you interested in forensics?
My forensic career started 24 years ago and will be completing 25 years in a couple of weeks. The department that I worked for wanted to start a CSI unit. But during that time there was no CSI on TV and no one knew what CSI was. Then I said yes and from that point onwards there was no return. They sent me for schooling which included basic, intermediate and advanced CSI which I studied at the University of California, Long Beach. I also did my advanced certification which very few people have and I got quite interested in it that I did a double advanced certificate as well. I have done almost every type of training available and have been able to solve well over 5,000 crimes from basic vandalism to homicides. My department is one of the few that do traditional CSI including fingerprints, DNA, different types of evidence such as biological evidence, trace evidence, traces from hair or fibre and any type of body fluid. From there I was asked if I would like to be sponsored for the FBI Academy in Quantico. That is the ultimate that anybody could reach. So I asked whether I was qualified and one of my supervisors sponsored me as he thought I should take my education further.??
?
?
"I think education is very important and the Wildlife and Nature Protection Society (WNPS) is heading in the right direction. Education is the best way to go because in Kenya my drivers need to be certified before they go out there"
Q? ?What happened thereafter?
Hence, I applied and there were thousands that have applied. The minimum qualification was that you had to have 10 years of experience. At Quantico they don?t just teach the basics but teach everything at a higher level. I applied and for six months I completely forgot about it and gave up hopes when one day they suddenly called me and asked if I was ready to go in three weeks. I was so happy because out of the thousands who applied only 12 were selected from the whole of US. Then I also found out that I?m the only person from the entire state of California that has been selected. It was the most memorable time of my life. I never expected it to be so advanced and there was so much to study. Sometimes classes would start at 6.30 am and would go on till 11.00 pm. The academy alone was bigger than Dehiwela and Mt. Lavinia combined. So you need wheels to go from one end to the other. It has its own crash track where they drive cars, crash it and we have to do the investigation and the photography. Everything was extremely hi-tech. My most exciting time was doing surveillance photography from helicopters and night vision photography which we would do with absolutely no light. Then we had the usual crime scene materials we would photograph including shoeprints, drug detection, surveillance on drug sales where our instructors would be the bad guys and we have to go in and pick our spot to take photographs of the way they come in, the drug transaction, etc.? ?
Q? ?How did you get involved in solving wildlife crimes??
On one of my visits to Kenya I was talking to people at the anti-poaching unit and I realized that they never had proper evidence when they caught people who were poaching, smuggling or trafficking. Evidence means to show the person associated with the crime or being at the crime scene or involved with the crime in some way. I told them what I do in the US and they invited me back to start working with them. The first thing that they found was that when someone shot an animal they wouldn?t want to get caught with the weapon, so they ducked the gun under a bush. So even if there are 10 people they don?t know who shot at the animal. Hence I introduced what is called Gunshot Residue Testing (GSR) which enables them to take that little testing kit, put it on their hands and detect who had fired the shot. That came in useful and we will enhance it in years ahead. I also taught them fingerprinting which was very useful. We started fingerprinting on tusks and we are still in the process of testing and we found some good methods. The tusks are porous and do not have a smooth surface. If it is a smooth surface we can get a good fingerprint. We started a project and it has proven to be successful and by next year we want to have the first wildlife crime fingerprint database only to associate people involved in wildlife crimes. This is going to be very unique.? ?
Q? ?Out of the 5,000 odd cases you have gotten involved with, what were the most difficult cases to crack?
That would be a lot of sex crimes and child abuse cases. Sometimes it will be a family member that they don?t want to be arrested or prosecuted or they don?t want to be a witness. If it?s a child then he or she can?t make those decisions. There was a case where a camera was left behind at a crime scene and when I looked at the flash card there were no faces there. But in one of the photographs I saw a finger. So I took it back into the lab, analysed it for a couple of hours and got his fingerprint detail off his finger. It then turned out that this person was identified in a lot of crimes.?
There were operations including money laundering and gun trafficking which have been very exciting. But every case can be as exciting as another. In cases such as homicides we have to think like the criminal. I?m also a Shooting Reconstruction Specialist and this is where we have to reconstruct the crime scene with the evidence that we have.? ?
?
"On one of my visits to Kenya I was talking to people at the anti-poaching unit and I realized that they never had proper evidence when they caught people who were poaching, smuggling or trafficking. Evidence means to show the person associated with the crime or being at the crime scene or involved with the crime in some way"
Q? ?Sri Lanka has a history of dragging criminal cases even with adequate evidence. What needs to be done is to streamline the process of getting hold of perpetrators as soon as possible?
The most important thing is to preserve a crime scene when a crime happens. The evidence needs to be preserved and from videos and pictures I see in Sri Lanka I don?t see that happening. The whole village, the next village and their relatives are looking down at the accident or dead body.?
I also see that in wildlife crime where a 100 people are gathered around a dead elephant. So if the elephant was killed by something we have lost our evidence there. If evidence is contaminated we cannot use it. Contamination means touching, walking in that area and taking evidence out. What we do is to secure it with crime scene tape so that no one can walk in. In that way we support the integrity of the crime scene.?
The collection of evidence needs to be done with a plan and a method by qualified people. The qualified people need to know exactly what they are doing and prior experience goes a long way. You also need to make sure that everything is safe when you enter a crime scene and you should enter with the bare minimum number of people.? ?
?
Q? ?How often do these wildlife crimes get reported?
In most instances they get reported by rangers who go on patrol or by the villagers that do a lot of walking, especially the tribesmen who can walk up to 20 to 30 miles on foot every day. Then again it could be a natural death, it could be caused by another animal or it could be a shooting.?
Sometimes we find animals hanging from snares and when it comes to snares it?s quite difficult to find a suspect. One of the key pieces of evidence we collect is from the cell phone. There is software that we use to extract evidence and do cell phone analysis and the information we get can be used as evidence to solve the crime. They can have a locked cell phone and delete files but we can still retrieve information.? ?
Q? ?As opposed to Kenya, in Sri Lanka we have the human elephant conflict and villagers often see animals as threats. How could we push them for co-existence?
Let me take an example about lions because lions are the animals that tend to affect people in Kenya the most. There is a programme in place right now where donors put money into a certain fund and if their cow is killed by a lion they get compensation. So they are not keen on killing the lion anymore. But sometimes they want to kill the lion because the cows, goats and sheep are valuable to them. Lions are the big killers, and this compensation programme has gone a long way and it has been implemented in tourism areas.? ?
Q? ?Sri Lanka also has a compensation scheme but the money is not enough to construct a damaged house, leave aside the crops. So do you think it would work here?
Compensation could work if the elephants destroy crops but where is this money coming from? It is very rarely that houses get damaged in Kenya and the cost of constructing a hut is quite cheap. In Sri Lanka, the farmers are not contributing to tourism as such. But the Masai warriors contribute because they are in the tourism area and tourists even visit their village. The money comes from lodgers, well-wishers and foundations who are interested in conservation. Because if a lion is killed, a luxury camp will not have their guests coming in, so they value the animal because that is part of their wealth.? ?
Q? ?Since you are in the safari industry, how important is it to have nature interpretation programmes such as what has been initiated by the WNPS?
I think education is very important and the Wildlife and Nature Protection Society (WNPS) is heading in the right direction. Education is the best way to go because in Kenya my drivers need to be certified before they go out there. Sometimes they may have to go to a guiding school for two years before they can be certified as a safari driver. You got to know exactly what you?re doing, how you behave and even identify every animal and bird out there. But in Sri Lanka, I have had trackers who have never opened their mouth during the entire safari ride. That was when I realized that I don?t need trackers but I can get the support from the jeep driver. Some of the jeep drivers are not qualified and know nothing about wildlife. So they can go in for a certification programme and perhaps have a sticker on their jeeps for guests to identify them as qualified drivers.? ? ? and we don?t have 100 to 200 jeeps coming in at once. Hence there?s no blocking and there?s space for everyone.? ?
?
"The most important thing is to preserve a crime scene when a crime happens. The evidence needs to be preserved and from videos and pictures I see in Sri Lanka I don?t see that happening. The whole village, the next village and their relatives are looking down at the accident or dead body. I also see that in wildlife crime where a 100 people are gathered around a dead elephant. So if the elephant was killed by something we have lost our evidence there. If evidence is contaminated we cannot use it "
Q? ?How do you see the future of wildlife in Sri Lanka?
That is if there is wildlife remaining for the future and if nothing is done right now, there won?t be any wildlife in the future. If all the elephants get killed there will be nothing for the future generations.?
From what I read I don?t see any positive outcomes. I don?t live in Sri Lanka so I don?t have first-hand experience; I don?t go out to the jungles as a lot of conservationists or wildlife lovers do. I think it?s good that there are associations and individuals who have come forward to fight for the wildlife and be their advocate and that in turn makes a big difference.? ?

## Title: In the Odyssey that is history, Ithaca is only a way-station
## Section: Opinion

In the Odyssey that is history, Ithaca is only a way-station
	
?
o much is being written about President Maithripala Sirisena?s political U-turn and the resulting chaos, both pro and against. Of all the regular political columnists, Tisaranee Gunasekara has written what is easily the best analysis, (Deranged, published by the Colombo Telegraph website on Nov. 11).
It?s a gem of an analysis. I am not saying this because it echoes my own fears, hopes and sentiments. This writer is neither a political analyst or columnist. Depending on others? evaluations and opinions about the current crisis, I found myself swimming in murky waters until I read Tisaranee?s column. I have never met the writer and do not even know how she looks like. What I can see clearly is an analytical mind of the highest order, free of personal prejudice. If she is biased, it?s in favour of democracy and our rights to live and breathe freely in the country of our birth.??
Her language is exceptionally good and obviously she?s extremely well read. In ?Deranged,? she quotes from The ?Lord of the Rings? by JRR Tolkien and refers to Homer?s epic poems. A political columnist doesn?t have to be literary; but in a country where most journalists brazenly display their lack of reading and inability to present a cohesive argument (in whatever language), it?s both a delight and a relief to come across a writer who has such wide reading and intellectual depth. Her column would still be a gem even without those literary allusions. But they are the embellishments which make reading it such a delight.??
She starts with a quote from Tolkien ? ?Precious, precious, precious, Gollum cried? ? and ends with a reference to Homer. Speaking about the battle that must be waged to protect our democratic rights, she writes: ?This battle requires the most inclusive tent. It is a battle that must be waged, and waged right, irrespective of the outcome. In the Odyssey that is history, Ithaca is only a way-station.???
That last sentence is something which should be hung as a slogan at the entrance of our parliament. It sums up, like nothing else written by any other columnist about the current crisis, the nature of the struggle which will have to be waged if we are not to lose our basic rights as citizens, not just now, or till December or till 2020, but for many centuries to come, for there will be more Ranil Wickremesinghes, Maithripala Sirisenas and Mahinda Rajapaksas in the eons to come.??
?
"What I can see clearly is an analytical mind of the highest order, free of personal prejudice. If she is biased, it?s in favour of democracy and our rights to live and breathe freely in the country of our birth"
The writer has made a comparison with the president?s ?coup? with Adolf Hitler?s call to an election as soon as he became Germany?s new chancellor through a backroom deal. She writes: ?They (the Nazis) understood that democracy can be killed best and easiest using the legitimacy a victorious election would bring.???
The comparison is striking. It doesn?t matter that we do not officially have Nazis and fascists here. It?s the thought processes which matter, the homophobia and hatred of political opponents, minorities and democratic institutions. I recall that one writer recently criticized Tisaranee for comparing Gotabhaya Rajapaksa to Adolf Hitler. I believe he has missed the point. When we compare someone to Hitler, it isn?t about so-and-so being exactly like him. It?s rather a way of saying that so-and-so has some of the traits, habits and thought processes which Hitler had. For example, one can argue that Gotabhaya has a nasty temper and liking for revenge, just like Hitler. If he hasn?t, then he can prove me wrong if and when he comes to power again.? ?
Finally, for those who haven?t read either Tolkien or Homer: Gollum is an important character in Tolkien?s ?The Hobbit?. He lives on an island on a mysterious lake, a dwarf in size, and is known for his greed. The latter quality reminds you of someone?? ?
As for Ithaca, that?s where Odysseus came from. He was sent by King Menelaus to bring back his eloped wife Helen from Troy. This took ten years of war (The Illiad), and it took Odysseus another ten years to return to Ithaca. Now you can figure out why Ithaca? is only a way-station in the Odyssey that is history.? ??

President, party leaders meeting ends inconclusively
	
The All Party Conference, called by President Maithripala Sirisena to discuss the current political impasse, ended with no conclusion in sight, it is learnt.
The President reportedly asked the representatives of the United National Party (UNP) to get the no-confidence motion passed through the proper procedure and then he would recognize it. The President also asked both the parties to respect the Standing Orders without quarrelling.
However, the UNP leaders affirmed that the motion had already been passed and therefore there was no need for them to move it again. At the meeting, the two sides argued back and forth on the legality of the no-confidence motion which, Speaker Karu Jayasuriya declared, was passed by voice vote in the House.
The UNP leaders asked the government to bring a counter motion challenging the stand of the Speaker if it were aggrieved by it.
UNP MP Lakshman Kiriella, who attended the meeting, said that the Speaker had announced his ruling, and it could not be challenged even in a court of law.
?If you are not happy with his ruling, you can counter it in Parliament with another motion. We are ready for it,? he said.
UNP MP Ajith P. Perera said his side commanded the support of more than 113 MPs, and they could be brought physically to the Presidential Secretariat as proof.
Speaker Jayasuriya boycotted the meeting. UNP Leader Ranil Wickremesinghe, Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa, party leaders Mano Ganeshan, Palani Digambaram, Wimal Weerawansa, Rauff Hakeem, Patali Champika Ranawaka, Douglas Devananda , TNA Leader R.

Prez tells UPFA:  Ready to show majority if no-faith motion moved properly
	
President Maithripala Sirisena reportedly asked the parliamentary group of the United People?s Freedom Alliance (UPFA) to be ready to show majority in Parliament if a no-confidence motion were brought through the proper procedure.
He had a meeting with the UPFA group only on Friday. He said he would not back down from his position on the formation of the new government at any cost.
The President said he would not reappoint UNP Leader Ranil Wickremesinghe as the Prime Minister under any circumstance.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister?s office issued a statement outlining the procedure to be followed in bringing a no-confidence motion. Accordingly, a no-confidence motion against the Prime Minister should be handed over to the Speaker with signatures of at least 20 Members of Parliament.
The Speaker is then required to verify the legality of such motion through the Secretary General of Parliament. The Secretary General of the Parliament is required to inform the Speaker that the motion is consistent with the Standing Orders.
The motion should be then recorded in the Order Book. The relevant Order Book should be then printed and distributed among all Members of Parliament on the first Friday following recording in the Order Book. The motion should then be taken up for debate in Parliament after five working days.
Matters stated in the Order Book should be taken in to consideration by the Committee on Parliamentary Business headed by the Speaker and comprising of members from the governing party including the Leader of the House and Chief Government Whip.
There will be another group of MPs representing the Opposition including the Leader of the Opposition. In addition, the Deputy Speaker and the Deputy Chairperson of Committees are members of this committee. The priority of the government matters in the Order Book is decided by the Leader of the House.
Once such a no-confidence motion is entered in the Order Book, the most recent date for it to be debated in the Parliament should be agreed upon, with the concurrence of the Leader of the House and the governing party.
The motion should be entered in to the agenda of the relevant day and it should be announced that the motion will be taken up for debate on such a date.
The Committee on Parliamentary Business should decide on the duration's to be allocated to the governing party and the opposition to debate the no-confidence motion.
The debate should be conducted on the relevant date and a vote should be taken and the results should be announced. The Hansard should be issued detailing the day?s proceedings. (Kelum Bandara)

Rajapaksanomics Peddling  Anti-Neoliberal Sovereignty
	
?
he farcical three-week Government and the circus of thuggery in Parliament has thrown the country into a serious political crisis. While media attention and public discussion are focused on questions of parliamentary democracy and constitutional legitimacy, the roots of the crisis lie in decades of neo-liberal economic policies that have created instability and dispossession.?
In recent weeks, pro-Rajapaksa ideologues have put forward a distorted understanding of neoliberalism to bolster their nationalist campaign. Economic devastation, they argue, necessitated the appointment of Mahinda Rajapaksa (MR) as Prime Minister to reverse the three year-long neoliberal onslaught, which they claim has undermined Sri Lanka?s sovereignty. According to them, it is only by arresting the sale of Sri Lanka?s assets and guarding the country?s sovereignty that the economic crisis can be addressed. Leaving aside complicity in MR?s anti-democratic politics, this article questions their flawed understanding of neo-liberalism. Their discourse of sovereignty is dangerous because it stokes xenophobic nationalism, and does not address the tremendous dispossession of ordinary people under neo-liberal capitalism.
Contradictions
It is true that Ranil Wickremesinghe?s UNP has been aggressive in promoting an international financial centre and free trade pacts. However, let?s be clear that financialisation, trade liberalization and massive internationally-financed infrastructure/urban development projects were also the central plank of MR?s economic programme. Yet, the latter?s economic policies together with the initiation of the Port City, Shangri- La, Hambantota Port and others projects are ignored, while the leasing of the Hambantota port and Colombo Port East Terminal as well as the Singapore FTA are called ?neo-liberalism? by the Rajapaksa ideologues.?
More importantly, such a narrow characterization of neo-liberalism is inadequate because it does not address the economic processes and dynamics that affect people?s lives. Their version of neo-liberalism, which focuses on whether state assets and national projects are controlled by or awarded to foreign entities, is more akin to a politics of economic nationalism. In other words, they are concerned about whether foreign or national capital gains in the process, but lack a critique of capital itself and the consequent forms of exploitation and dispossession.
Finance Capital
Neo-liberalism, as articulated by Marxist geographer David Harvey and others, is a class project of finance capital. In addition to exploitation of labour in the process of capitalist production, in the neo-liberal age, finance capital directly dispossess people of their wealth, assets and entitlements; when necessary force is also used for example to grab lands and resources from people. Furthermore, under neo-liberal globalization, the distinction between global and national finance capital no longer holds as the financial and banking sectors in each country are integrated into the global financial system. It is finance capital ? both global finance and its local financial partners ? that gain, while it is the working people that lose out.
Since the open economy policies of 1978, the financial sector in Sri Lanka has been expanding with occasional crises exacerbated by the collapse of finance companies and even some banks. The growth of the financial sector has accelerated considerably over the last decade, particularly after the war ended and the inflow of global capital. While many of the finance companies in Sri Lanka were started by and, for the most part, are owned by local financiers, the major banks are owned by the state. These finance companies and banks have been integrated into the global financial system with the inflow of investments and loans from global financiers. It is such finance capital that is behind the major expansion of leasing, micro-finance and pawning businesses, which have to a great extent been responsible for the dispossession of working people through rising indebtedness.
We seem to have a very short memory. The MR regime was in the forefront of providing avenues for the accumulation of finance capital. The promotion of capital markets, including efforts to divert EPF funds to inflate the Colombo Stock Exchange, the expansion of the insurance industry, and the pressures for state banks to take large international loans after the war, all contributing towards greater financialisation of the national economy and its integration with global finance capital.
?Much of the global capital inflows were invested in real estate, including condominiums, supported by policies promoting the urbanization and beautification of Colombo.
?
"Nationalism, whether it is Sinhala Buddhist nationalism or Tamil nationalism, are potent for electoral campaigns. They have, time and again, proven effective in dividing ethnic communities to mobilize electoral support, but in the process also unleash fear and even violence against dissent."
?The growth of the stock market and expansion of the real estate sector are dependent on speculation, and deliver whopping profits for finance capital, but dispossess working people as repeated speculative booms followed by bursts become justification to cut social welfare and privatize public services.
Neo-liberal accumulation targets people?s entitlements such as free education and healthcare. Privatization and commercialization of education, and the promotion of private healthcare and health insurance industries, have become avenues for new profit-seeking businesses.?
In this context, inequality has been rising in the country over the last decade in particular, both in terms of disparity in income and wealth as well as access to decent social welfare. On the other hand, a small wealthy class has emerged displaying their massive mansions and luxury vehicles through accumulation in the finance and construction industries.?
Economic nationalism
In reality, the substance of the neo-liberal economic policies of the Sirisena-Wickremesinghe Government after 2015 were no different from the economic policies of the MR Government after the war. That is why the pro-Rajapksa ideologues? critique of the neo-liberal trajectory of the economy is so weak. They are compelled to latch on to nationalist arguments about the undermining of sovereignty. Ironically, such ideologues do not consider the fact that it was the MR regime that initiated the sale of sovereign bonds a decade ago. With billions of US dollars in sovereign bonds that have to be repaid over the next few years, those loans now provide leverage for the IMF and rating agencies backed by global finance capital to push for further neo-liberal reforms.
The nationalist arguments about sovereignty focus on the bilateral agreements in trade and investment, and how Sri Lanka?s assets and wealth are being sold.?
However, they have no answer to the exploitation and dispossession that comes through the projects taken forward by local financiers and for that matter the collusion of local and foreign capital. Furthermore, the economic rhetoric of the three-week MR Government almost immediately retreated to statements about the importance of wooing foreign investors; comments that are conveniently ignored by the MR ideologues.?
These contradictions aside, the thrust of the pro-MR critique is in reality neither about neo-liberalism nor about the sovereignty of the people, as any genuine critique of both would have focused on the exploitation and dispossession of people. Rather, it is about their conception of the nation and national sovereignty, both important to shore up nationalist support to a Rajapaksa government.
?
"Neo-liberal accumulation targets people?s entitlements such as free education and healthcare. Privatization and commercialization of education, and the promotion of private healthcare and health insurance industries, have become avenues for new profit-seeking businesses. "
The nationalist campaign to consolidate power is framed around xenophobic fears of external intervention with MR portrayed as the strong leader to the nationalist task of withstanding external pressures. Some of those leftists opposed to imperialist intervention also fall for this rhetoric, because they forget that their opposition to external forces should be based on principles of democracy, equality and economic justice. Sadly, they fall victim to an authoritarian nationalist who carries forward the same attacks against democracy and people?s economic lives in the name of national sovereignty.?
Nationalism, whether it is Sinhala Buddhist nationalism or Tamil nationalism, are potent for electoral campaigns.?
They have, time and again, proven effective in dividing ethnic communities to mobilize electoral support, but in the process also unleashed fear and even violence against dissent. Xenophobia stoked by such nationalist campaigns often lead to witch hunts for ?enemies within,? including attacks on one or another minority community in the country, as with the attacks on the Muslim community over the last five years.?
In the absence of any serious economic alternative, Rajapaksanomics, if given the opportunity to take hold, will be more of the neo-liberal policies we have seen over the last decade blared with nationalist peddling of sovereignty in tandem with fears of separatism.?
Polarization of communities and the consolidation of authoritarian power will in reality set conditions to entrench a neo-liberal economy, including with the force necessary to crush resistance and continue the exploitation and dispossession of people.?

Work selflessly to resolve political crisis: Sajith
	
It is time to put aside one?s self interests in order to?resolve the present political crisis, UNP Deputy Leader Sajith Premadasa said today.
?Appointing a new Prime Minister and new party leaders is not a solution to the present political crisis. This is a time to work selflessly and without self-interests,? Mr. Premadasa told a media briefing yesterday.
?We have had several party leaders meetings but none was focused on the hardships which people have to undergo as a result of the present political crisis.?
He underlined the fact that a person appointed to the premiership must resign if he did not have majority support in the House to function as the Prime Minister.
?I would have resigned and gone home if it becomes clear to me that I don?t command a majority in the House,? he said. (Yohan Perera and Ajith Siriwardana)
