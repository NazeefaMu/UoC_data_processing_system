Cabinet nod to introduce colourless standard packaging for cigarettes
	
A proposal to the effect of introducing ?standard packaging? (colourless) for tobacco products has received the green light from the cabinet of ministers.
The government said the proposal was aimed at reducing the number of deaths caused by tobacco and to minimize the attraction towards tobacco products. The proponent was Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne. According to a cabinet spokesperson, the standard package will only have two colours or black and white can be used and no mark can be displayed other than the trade name, product name, quantity and the graphical health warnings mandated by the government.
The cabinet of ministers approved the proposal submitted by Dr. Senaratne to amend the National Authority on Tobacco and Alcohol Act No. 27 of 2006 or to instruct the legal draftsman to prepare the drafts for the regulation under the said act. The government is also considering banning of cigarette sales near places of religious worship and schools and limit cigarette sales to purchase of an entire packet, instead of the current practice, where most smokers purchase one or two cigarettes for immediate consumption.
Tobacco taxation in Sri Lanka is already among the highest in the world.
Ceylon Tobacco PLC, a unit of British American Tobacco, as the only legal cigarette manufacturer in the country, has a monopoly on cigarette sales in Sri Lanka.? Due to higher taxation and migrant workers working at large-scale infrastructure projects, Sri Lanka has a thriving illicit cigarette market.

CBK, Ranil meet at Temple Trees
	
A meeting took place between former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe at Temple Trees yesterday.
Journalists who had arrived to cover the UNP Politburo meeting last evening were able to witness Ms. Kumaratunga entering Temple Trees just as the meeting was about to end.
The meeting between the two came in the backdrop of certain statements critical of Ms. Kumaratunga said to have been made by President Sirisena 48 hours before.
Journalists present were unable to make any headway with regard to what the meeting was about with MP Nalin Bandara being non-committal. ?I don?t know anything about a meeting between the Prime Minister and the former President,? he said.
All indications are that following countless meetings between members of both the UNP and SLFP and the prime minister a decision has been made to give the alliance entered into between the two main political parties another go by enlisting the help of SLFPers willing to support the prime minister.

Countering heat  stroke
	
Despite the recent showers that were observed in several parts of the country, especially in the evening hours, one cannot deny the intolerable heat experienced occasionally, during the other times of the day. Hence, the risk of getting dehydrated is nevertheless high due to the prevailing hot weather during the day.
As such, the need to take necessary measures to avoid suffering a heat stroke is vital under this circumstance. Speaking to , Consultant Physician at the Colombo South Teaching Hospital and the President of the Sri Lanka Geriatric Association Dr. Dilhar Samaraweera shared his insights on how a heat stroke could affect an individual and how to prevent the risk of suffering a heat stroke during hot weather conditions.? ?
According to the doctor, people have been reported to the hospital after suffering conditions of heat stroke during recent times and especially during this part of the year. Those who have reported to hospitals during recent times as a result of heat stroke are mainly marathon runners (who have collapsed after strenuous activities), elderly patients (who experienced exhaustion due the heat) and people exposed to the sun for prolonged periods, resulting in dehydration. (Those in the latter group include people representing the forces).? ?
Process of avoiding damage?
Explaining what a heat stoke is, Dr. Samaraweera said that the condition can simply be defined as a situation where the body temperature could rise above 1040F / 400C or higher, which may result in either the loss of consciousness or loss of function. Due to severe dehydration the patient would fail to maintain the normal body temperature since he or she has already sweated and no longer has the ability to sweat further. According to Dr. Samaraweera, when a person perspires, the evaporation of sweat would help bring the body temperature down to the degree at which the normal body temperature is maintained. Moreover, when the environmental temperature increases, the body will try to perspire and reduce the temperature, thereby working towards maintaining the normal body temperature. Otherwise, when the external temperature increases, the body temperature will also increase. Therefore to avoid such damage, the human body has a mechanism of producing lot of sweat and evaporating it to maintain a normal body temperature.? ?
When inquired about what happens when a person gets dehydrated, he said that in such an instance, the sweating will entirely stop at which point the body temperature will rise rapidly. ?The body will try to maintain the temperature by diverting the blood to the skin; a condition known as ?Cutaneous Vasodilation?, which is the mechanism to reduce the body heat. The blood vessels will dilate in the skin, resulting in sweat and the reduction of body temperature, thereby trying to maintain the normal body temperature. Through this process, the body will try to maintain a constant blood supply to the skin. However, under such circumstances there will be a compromise on the blood supply to the brain. As a result, one may have an alteration in the level of consciousness. Also, one may experience total loss of consciousness and even death. This is what happens during a heat stroke? Dr. Samaraweera explained.??
Vulnerable groups?
There are two ways an individual could develop a heat stroke. The first method is when an individual is exposed to a hot environment. Even if the person is not engaged in exercise, if he or she is exposed to a very hot and humid temperature the chances of developing a heat stroke is high. This particularly affects infants and elderly people above 65 years of age. ?They are very likely to develop a heat stroke due to their impaired thermoregulatory mechanism, which is not well developed when an individual is very young. In the case of an elderly person, the thermoregulatory systems does not function well owing to the ageing process.? ?
The other category vulnerable to developing a heat stroke are people engaged in vigorous physical activities, which may result in increasing their core body temperature. People who prolong standing under the hot sun for long durations such as in the army or sportsman engaged in vigorous activity are vulnerable to get dehydrated. This condition might eventually result in a heat stroke,? he added.? ?
Additionally, people with heart disease and chronic kidney disease are often under medications to control their health conditions and the chances of them losing much sodium and water are high. When such people are exposed to hot weather they will be prone to lose more salt and water due to the increasing temperature. Such people need to consult their doctors in the event they feel dehydrated in addition to staying away from the heat, the doctor said.? ?
Red Flag Signs andFirst Aid
Explaining the symptoms related to a heat stroke, he said that a person would notice that he or she is experiencing a low rate of sweating in addition to indicating a very red and bright coloured skin tone. Cramping muscles, weakness in muscles, tiredness, exhaustion and feeling faint are the other symptoms of a heat stroke. ?The patient would also experience an increased heart rate with rapid, shallow breathing in addition to feeling light headed. Symptoms of vertigo and headache are also common following which a person will experience alteration of consciousness or total loss of consciousness.
The best example to explain this is the heating of a vehicle. When we drive a vehicle and if there is a radiator leak, the engine will start heating up. When the engine starts heating up, there is an indicator light that lights up in the meter. Once you recognize that there is a warning light, the vehicle should be immediately stopped and allowed to cool down. It is also necessary in some instances to add water to the radiator tank and let the vehicle cool for sometime. If the driver ignores these warnings and continues driving, the engine would heat up and eventually stop functioning? he warned.? ?
Stating that the example is similar to what happens within the human body in the case of a heat stoke, he added that when warning signs surface, such as when someone feels tired, exhausted or is experiencing a headache or lightheadedness in addition to less sweating and dry skin, it is pivotal that one should immediately stop whatever work he or she was engaged in. The patient should take a rest and seek a place that offers shade. If the person is suffering from heat and exhaustion, it is important that he or she should immediately cool oneself. This cooling can be done using any method such as pouring water on the body. It is better if the person can get totally immersed in water or if possible sponge or cold compress the body using cold water. Also fanning can be used to cool oneself? he added.? ?
According to the doctor, the evaporation of water would help reduce the body temperature. Therefore, if the clothes the person was wearing is bulky or tight, it is better to either loosen or avoid wearing such clothes and opt for comfort clothing. If the person is able to drink, water should be provided. If available, Oral Rehydration Solution (ORS) would be the best to be administered on the patient since it also contains salt. Explicating that the body loses not only water but also other electrolytes and especially salt/sodium; which is why the patient experiences cramps, weakness of muscles and even confusion, Dr. Samaraweera advised that king coconut would be the ideal if available since it is the closest natural solution to saline.? ?
Prevention
In order to prevent the risk of heat stroke it is important to ensure that a person consumes plenty of fluids. During situations where an individual experiences much heat and evaporation, it is recommended to consume at least 2.5 to 3 litres of fluid (for an average person) each day. Water, king coconut and fruit juice are recommended in order to stay hydrated.? ?
?Avoid exposure to the sunlight between 11.00 a.m. and 3.00 p.m. since the heat would be extreme during these hours. Wearing sunscreen and light coloured clothing is recommended when exposed to hot weather. One should note that dark coloured clothing will absorb more heat, which would affect the increasing body heat as well. Wear loose and comfortable clothes instead of opting for bulky and tight clothes when exposed to the heat. Also, those who exercise should avoid engaging in very strenuous activities during times when the temperature is high because it can cause exhaustion. Also, it is encouraged to consume other fluids such as fruit juice in addition to the intake of water when exercising because it helps to keep the body hydrated. People living indoors are encouraged to keep doors and windows open to let the air flow in and facilitate proper ventilation.? ?
Also, it should be noted that the fan has a negative aspect despite being used to counter the heat because what circulates within the household is often hot air. This will in fact contribute to the increasing level of body temperature resulting in dehydration and exhaustion. Therefore, when the fan is used to counter the heat, it is recommended to keep a bowl of water inside the room since the water would help cool the circulating air. One should also be cautious about the alcohol intake because it is a substance, which causes diuresis; a condition which reduces the water content in the body by the actions of the kidneys. Therefore, alcohol should be avoided at all cost during high temperature because it will dehydrate a person further? he added.? ?
Moreover, Dr. Samaraweera strongly advised against leaving anyone alone inside a parked vehicle under hot weather conditions. The temperature in a parked vehicle under the hot sun will rise by 200F or more than 6.70C within ten minutes. He said that such a rise in the temperature could result in a heat stroke, in the event someone is inside the parked vehicle, which is left under hot sun or a warm environment. In a final note, Dr. Samaraweera added that if someone suffers a heat stroke or observes any symptoms in a person related to the condition, it is strongly advised to administer first aid and immediately rush the patient to the nearest hospital for further treatment.? ? ?

Development challenges and moving forward
	
The change of regime in 2015 January raised people?s aspirations for a positive social and political transformation. Many people felt that the country could move away from the conflictual past to a more peaceful future. They also expected that their myriad of problems could now be managed by a regime committed to the well-known principles of good governance. But, after three years, since the formation of the new Government, people?s hopes have been largely dashed and the country is embroiled in an unprecedented political crisis. Nobody knows how we are going to get out of it!??
Taking a closer look at how research and development helps and what happens when it is neglected
As I have pointed out in several articles in these columns, immediately after the formation of the new regime in 2015, some of the key constituents of the new regime represented extremely contradictory political views that it was virtually impossible for them to pursue a collective programme of reform. This was evident throughout the three-year period and this became quite clear whenever the Government leaders were forced to take a firm stand on important public policy issues. Yet, they could not do so because the regime was caught between two very different ideological positions that I have described as ?corrosive neo-liberalism? and ?violent ethno-nationalism? in the political domain.? ?
Mismanaging development process?
As is well known, neo-liberalism was embraced by many countries since the late 1970?s and some of them have since then made many economic gains by way of FDI, technology transfer and rapid economic growth. China is the most notable example in the world, but there are many others in east Asia and elsewhere. Though deficient in terms of democratic governance and civil liberties, the technocratic nature of the regimes enabled these countries to mange their economic development process in an efficient manner by making necessary public investments in such areas as education, research, institution building and essential infrastructure development without wasting borrowed money on economically and socially useless projects. But, Sri Lanka by and large mismanaged the development process and allowed industries we had built over many decades to collapse. We put all our eggs in one basket; i.e. the garments industry and, with increasing wages due to inflation and devaluation of the rupee, many people started migrating to other countries.? ??
Instead of scientifically managing the sector, populist Governments took short-term, popular measures to appease the rural voter, making the latter dependent on subsidies such as highly subsidised inputs and income support. Yet, many youth had no interest in agriculture due to its precarious nature as a source of income. The main reason was that the agricultural sector has remained stagnant due to lack of crop diversification, neglect of agricultural research leading to almost a total collapse of agricultural research institutions, devaluation of agricultural extension and the lack of development of agro-based industries to create more lucrative employment opportunities in rural areas. Moreover, liberal import policies led to the collapse of many rural industries, forcing many people to leave rural areas.? ?
Our political leaders have been either extremely inward looking, confined to their close social circles in Colombo or reproducing themselves through exchange of favours
Education?
Persistently low public investments in education did not help improve its quality, making many of the products of public educational institutions unfit for highly skilled and productive employment in a competitive labour market. This situation encouraged the private education sector ranging from private tuition classes through international schools to private higher educational establishments in urban centres. Products of private educational institutions and those who returned after receiving education overseas filled most of the vacancies in the private sector. Meanwhile , the products of public educational institutions in general were left out of more lucrative employment in the corporate sector.??
?The situation became serious with the rapid expansion of the public university system during the past three decades without a commensurate increase in budgetary allocations for general and higher education. While the quality of education either stagnated or declined, successive Governments continued to absorb university graduates into state institutions to fill non-existent jobs. Almost random deployment of new recruits in diverse state institutions without any training or preparation not only did not contribute to their performance and productivity, but also created a demoralised and frustrated youthful workforce.? ?
Technological capabilities?
As is well known, both developed as well as developing countries today compete with each other on the strength of their technological capabilities. Countries that invest heavily on R and D, usually have an edge over the others because the former can either improve the quality of their export products or introduce new products into the global market. Many East Asian countries have done extremely well in this regard. Global university rankings put many East Asian universities ahead of the universities in other parts of the non-western world. The same pattern is evident in the registration of patents across the world. Most recent university rankings underscore that none of the South Asian universities appear in the first hundred universities in Asia, let alone the Sri Lankan universities. None of our universities is included even in the first 2000 universities in the world.? ?
As indicated above, it is research and development that enable countries to enhance the production processes or introduce new products into the market. So, it is critically important to invest in R and D.?
What is outlined above shows the developments challenges we have faced over the years and how we would have overcome them by adopting strategies that have worked in other countries. But, what has been missing in the case of Sri Lanka is the absence of an enlightened political elite. Our political leaders have been either extremely inward looking, confined to their close social circles in Colombo, reproducing themselves through exchange of favours and sharing the social surplus produced by hapless masses through corrupt practices or extremely archaic and parochial, making use of backward segments of society to gain and retain power and privilege for them and their retinue while preventing the country from making any progress on any front. What is common to both the elites are corruption and the abuse of power.? ?
Most recent university rankings underscore that none of the South Asian universities appear in the first hundred universities in Asia, let alone the Sri Lankan universities
As a result, neoliberalism that has enabled many countries in the region and elsewhere to promote rapid economic growth has been turned into an extremely corrosive force by one faction of the political elite that thrives on gross inequalities and injustices in society, the other faction has used ethno-nationalism to lead the country on a downward spiral of inter-community discord, corruption, economic stagnation and increasing misery for the vast majority of ordinary people.
As a result, today, the country is torn between two powerful, but equally negative political forces. The challenge before the right thinking citizens is to find an alternative path to development, public welfare and national unity, that helps the country to move away from both corrosive neo-liberalism and violent ethno-religious nationalism. The future well-being of the ordinary masses will depend on whether the progressive political forces succeed in taking the country on the alternative path mentioned above.(The writer is an Emeritus Professor of Sociology and a product of the University of Colombo)?

For the love of today, or  why the young take  to Sanuka
	
When you listen to ?Saragaye?, and watch the video, you get enveloped in complete happiness. In some vague, indefinable, magical way, Sanuka Wickramasinghe has given a form to our collective experience of one night stands and crushes and unrequited romances. And yet the elders don?t like him: they lambast him over every little detail.
Even the choice of title, for these puritans, is a gross misdemeanour (?Saragaye?, in case you were wondering, is the apotheosis of ragaya, or passion and lust) which may lead the young astray (as if the elders weren?t doing a despicably good job of that already!). I can?t understand how one music video, and a 24 year old vocalist with around three or four minor hits to his name, could bring about this heightening of an already terse conflict between the elders and their offspring, but there you have it: the former criticise him because he appeals so ineffably and directly to the latter.??
While the elders see in it the kind of music that can corrupt our youth, these people see in it a perpetuation of a form of music that does not thrive on words or a literary sensibility.?
Many of those I?ve met with, and interviewed or chatted with at length at some point, who are not elderly, see in ?Saragaye? a facile novelty that barely transcends its limitations (more on those later) because of the vocalist himself, and the electronic percussive rhythms that we?ve not heard for quite some time. While the elders see in it the kind of music that can corrupt our youth, these people see in it a perpetuation of a form of music that does not thrive on words or a literary sensibility. Even the young, armed with their Sinhala Honours Degrees, offer an excuse for their mixed feelings towards the man: that despite the percussive rhythms and the daring monochrome visuals, ?Saragaye? offers nothing by way of summing up the human condition through poetry.??
This attitude of rabid scepticism, while not excusable, isn?t without reason. As I pointed out in my article on Bathiya and Santhush before, and last year in my article on Ajantha Ranasinghe, in the Sinhala sarala gee a balance was always kept between the personal and the aesthetic. The narrator became, in the early days of the Amaradevas and Victor Ratnayakes, the embodiment of a collective experience, because that poetic tradition provided a multitude of metaphors and rhetorical devices. This was true of Ranasinghe?s work, and even truer of, on the one hand, K. D. K. Dharmawardhana (whose best lyrics are laden with so much poetry that they are difficult to take in, in one go) and, on the other, Premakeerthi de Alwis (whose rich vocabulary he discarded in favour of a simple, almost verbal form of poetry). We missed out on the word, and substituted for it the glosses of technology.??
Because technology, no matter how alluring it is, usually isn?t very interesting or enriching, the older generation fell out. There had been production houses in the seventies and eighties, but they had all been primitive in the way they were operated: if you got your recording wrong, you had to repeat, again and again. That sense of meticulousness gets lost in the blur of money-making processes, and the new production houses, owned by second generation artists and the offspring of the first generation artists ? Ranga Dassanayake, Raj Seneviratne, Bathiya and Santhush ? unleashed a New Wave. But that New Wave operated on a fatal rift, between technology on the one hand and the profit motive on the other. (Can they ever coexist? I personally don?t think so.) They entranced the millennials, from my generation, and predictably evaded, and alienated, the old.??
Youngsters who respond to a song like ?Saragaye?, the elders I know keep on telling me, aren?t responding to the words or even the meaning that those words evoke, but instead reflect on and allow themselves to be carried away by what lies on the surface. These elders point at Iraj, and even Bathiya and Santhush, and claim that they began this trend, forgetting that while technology clearly cannot, should not, and will not be a substitute for lyricism, we can?t avoid resorting to it either. The millennials went for this technology-induced music; they were what Pauline Kael referred to decades ago as ?brutalists?, who were tired of the ?sanctity? of the songs they were being forced to listen to.??
After Bathiya and Santhush and Iraj, all three of whom spawned a generation of imitators who never transcended their imitativeness despite the superficiality of their work, we come to Sanuka Wickramasinghe.
Sanuka represents a different kind of facile novelty, not just in terms of the electronic percussiveness and the rhythms of his music, but the themes he goes for in song after song. When you read (into) the answers he has given to those questions asked by interviewers in those countless gossip websites, you are enthralled by the simplicity and naivet? of the way he sees the world. (He?s still a schoolboy, even in the way he croons.) If his songs ? and there haven?t been many of them since he started out in 2011 ? reflect a vibrant youthfulness, it?s because he?s young and very much so. (One year my senior) Sanuka has gone beyond those earlier imitators before him in taking the young beyond technology, but if he has failed at least a little in this venture, it?s because the old, having responded to this endeavour of his warmly, are instantly repelled by what he thematises in his works.??
About a year after he released ?Saragaye?, Sanuka released ?Perawadanak?, which was manifestly different, especially in terms of the themes it tackled. If ?Saragaye? belonged to a young demographic that hailed from an urbane, chic, and school-going milieu, ?Perawadanak?, with its vignette of an unfulfilled love, appealed to a considerably elderly population. A schoolboy I know once asked Sanuka why, and his reply was that this shift in the targeted audience was an effort to get his songs beyond the youth; it was an attempt at pleasing the elders who shirked him. (?Saragaye? was about giving into passion; ?Perawadanak was about the catharsis of a broken romance, which I think taps into a more elderly mentality.) Did it work? I should think so: many of the elders I know, and talk with, while disdainful of ?Saragaye?, reacted less coldly to ?Perawadanak.? That Sanuka has not done a song since then speaks volumes, I believe, about the fact that he released it just a year after his first big hit just so to get out his themes to a wider public, since in Sri Lanka, the young, while comprising 25% of the total population, are just not enough for someone of his calibre to reach stardom.??
These two songs reflect the kind we?ve been missing out for almost a decade. They are not perfect in any conceivable sense ? which begs the question, why should we demand perfection in any art form? But the indictment that there is no meaning in ?Saragaye?, that the lyrics lack the requisite complexity for us to elevate it to the status of ART, are, I firmly believe, lopsided at best and wildly inaccurate at worst. ?Saragaye?, for instance, opens with these mystical, almost otherworldly, and deliberately fragmented lines:??
It?s fragmentary for the simple reason that the love story being described here has no proper structure, or for that matter order: unlike those conventional music videos you see everywhere here, there are no walls to be surmounted or for that matter no lovers bemoaning failed romances. The narrator of ?Saragaye? has no standalone voice either, because Sanuka is not the protagonist of his video; he?s observing from the sidelines, reflecting on what he perceives. The fragmented lyrics add depth to this already lopsided romance, and in the end, we don?t really understand what the hero or protagonist sees in the woman he befriends.??
Those who argue that contemporary music has become a mishmash are, while not wrong, aren?t entirely correct either. The most common excuse dished out is that the young don?t look out for complexity in the lyrics, that they are entranced by the allure of the surface ? in other words, technology ? so much that they don?t bother reading into the work. Nothing could be further from the truth. In deceiving themselves about the young this way, the elders, or at least those who aren?t willing to compromise or give their offspring the benefit of the doubt, are forgetting that we are seeing a revival of sorts in our musical sphere. It?s the kind of pop revival Europe underwent in the seventies, with the rise of ABBA and Brotherhood of Man and Lulu, all three of whom won at the Eurovision Song Contest for tunes we remember and treasure and hum for their innocence and simplicity, despite the fact that, yes, the elders of that time derided them.??
The elders have spoken. So have the young. We can choose to side with either side, or we can enjoy what?s on the radio. Perhaps we?d better switch on the radio. That?s what I?d do, since for me, that?s the only real option we have.??

Karu says lack of good governance killing public enterprises
	
As the economy continues to fall victim to nepotism, which taxes the nation in terms of income and productivity, Speaker of Parliament Karu Jayasuriya this week stressed the need to do away with the corrupt practice, so that the public enterprises can be revived from their inefficient status.
Referring to the frequent occurring of political appointments to the director boards of public enterprises, the speaker stated such developments remain an area of serious concern and said steps are being taken to address the same.
?There continues to be a lack in the professional management of public enterprises.
There have been many political appointments at top levels. We have always maintained that the boards of directors and chairmen should be professionals and not friends and family. This is needed to run the place efficiently,? said Jayasuriya, addressing a forum on good governance in public enterprises in Colombo.
He added that it must be ensured that the chairmen and those sitting on the boards are dynamic people, who are well-versed on the enterprise, industry and its market, as it is they who will be responsible for a successful operation.
Attributing the mismanagement of public enterprises to the poor selection of heads, Jayasuriya highlighted that the Parliamentary Committee on Public Enterprises (COPE) in its recent reports to parliament has noted a number of serious concerns, which require immediate action.
The concerns include lack of transparency and accountability, lack of professional management of public enterprises, financial indiscipline, irregularities, manipulations and malpractices, including large-scale frauds and corporate failures, ineffective progress review and performance monitoring, ineffective internal controls, risk management practices and audit and inadequate disclosures in financial reporting, among others.
To mitigate such issues, Jayasuriya said the director boards of public enterprises must be able to interact with all stakeholders.
?They must make sure that sufficient time is spent to deliberate on board papers, especially those in relation to specific development projects and related activities, so that timely implementation of such projects is assured,? he pointed out.
Jayasuriya also stressed that the director boards must seek to ensure the financial viability of the enterprise, collectively direct the affairs, monitor and control the executive management, meet the stakeholder interests and most importantly ensure moral and ethical commitment in areas such as bribery and corruption.
Furthermore, as the custodians of public resources, Jayasuriya said the director boards should exercise their mandated rights and responsibilities with integrity and in good faith, within the legal and regulatory framework governing the public enterprises under the directions and control of the minister and Finance Ministry or Treasury (Public Enterprises Department) under the direct supervision of the line ministry.

New Govt. with sections of SLFP soon: PM
	
The Government would soon have a new structure and new programmes, where some of the SLFP Ministers and the UNP would be working together, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said today.
Mr. Wickremesinghe said this at the launch of Lakeview Residencies project at Talawathugoda this morning.
?The SLFP Ministers met President Maithripala Sirisena and met me Wednesday night and we have decided to restructure the Government and to come up with a new programme of work,? the Prime Minister said.
?Subjects to all Ministries will be allocated scientifically,? the Prime Minister added.
Mr Wickremesinghe said this in response to a request made by Minister of Megapolis and Western Development Patali Campika Ranawaka, who also spoke at the event before the Prime Minister.
The Prime Minister added that projects such as Lakeview Residencies were needed to fulfil the housing needs of the middle class.
?More houses are needed for the middle class as the population of this particular strata, is increasing at the moment.
?Sri Lanka is a middle-income country but it will convert into a higher middle income earning nation in the near future. We, therefore, will have to adjust to this need and provide necessary infrastructure facilities,? the Prime Minister added.
He said the population of whole Western Province, Kurunegala up to Chilaw would become a middle- class population region soon.
?The Prime Minister added that lands in these urban areas will be mostly used for housing rather than using them for industries,? he said. (Yohan Perera)

The 12 member politburo of the United National Party (UNP) met yesterday discussed a proposal to set up new positions in the party including appointing a Propaganda Secretary, a Media Secretary and a Trade Union Affairs Secretary, Politburo member MP Nalin Bandara Jayamaha said yesterday.
Mr Bandara told journalists these new positions will be created in addition to the general secretary.
However, he said no names were nominated for the posts at yesterday?s meeting. He said the politburo would have to meet at least two more occasions to decide on the reorganization.

NJC calls SLSFTA a blow to economic interests of SL
	
The National Joint Committee (NJC) yesterday made a public statement requesting parliamentarians to vote against the proposed Sri Lanka-Singapore Free Trade Agreement (SLSFTA), describing it as a ?blow to national economic interests?.
At a press conference, Mr Nalaka Jayaweera of the NJC was critical of numerous provisions which put the Sri Lankan market at risk of exploitation and expressed concern that the government entered into the trade liberalisation agreement without the endorsement or agreement of a single Sri Lankan institute or professional organisation.
Mr. Jayaweera also pointed out that there were marked differences in the allowances made for Sri Lanka by Singapore in contrast to those made for Singapore by Sri Lanka.
One of the key concerns raised was the move to liberalise the services sector without putting proper national registration mechanisms and relevant regulations in place first, a move which would subject Sri Lanka?s services industry to unchecked encroachment.
Mr Jayaweera argued that the number of service sectors (including architecture, engineering, legal, computing, construction, management consultancy and financial) which are on the FTA?s positive list but do not have registration mechanisms paves the way for ?non-nationals with sub-standard qualifications? to enter and practise, compromising the positions held by Sri Lankan professionals and also putting consumers of the industries at risk.
In contrast, Mr. Jayaweera pointed out that Singapore boasts a highly regulated framework for almost all sectors listed for liberalisation as well as a highly saturated market for most industries. As a result, he argued that opening Sri Lanka?s service sectors without national regulation would open up a ?single traffic corridor in favour of Singapore?.
Dr. Lalithasiri Gunaruwan of the NJC also raised that in contrast to the FTA?s narrow territorial definition for Singapore, ?Sri Lankan territory? is defined broadly in the agreement to include Sri Lanka?s exclusive economic zone and continental shelf, opening up the opportunity for exploitation of Sri Lanka?s valuable oceanic resources.
The FTA was further criticised for enabling access to Sri Lanka for citizens and permanent residents of Singapore, while Singapore would only enable access to citizens of Sri Lanka under it.
The NJC urged all parliamentarians to vote against the agreement, stating it would not hesitate to ?publicly denounce members of parliament who would vote in favour of the anti-patriotic and nationally detrimental international agreement.?
?The future will hold those bureaucrats, professionals and politicians who were instrumental in signing this agreement liable for its negative implications on the Sri Lankan economy,? Mr. Jayaweera said. (Tilini Rajapaksa and Thilanka Kanakarathna)

PM requested to hold PC polls under old system
	
Democratic People's Front (DPF) leader and Minister Mano Ganesan said today they had requested Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe to hold the upcoming provincial council election under the preferential voting system.
He said they had made this request at a meeting parties representing the minority communities such as the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress (SLMC), Tamil National Alliance (TNA), Democratic People's Front (DPF), the All Ceylon Makkal Congress (ACMC) and Eelam People's Democratic Party (EPDP) had with the Prime Minister at Temple Trees yesterday.
?The ward-based system has created uncertainty in the country and now we have a situation where we have been unable to set up an administration in certain local government bodies because of the complexities existing in the new electoral system,? he said.
The minister said the government had good intentions in mind when they brought in the new electoral system, but it had some shortcomings adding that certain amendments should be brought in to improve the implementation of the system.
He said Minister Faiszer Musthapha, who participated in the discussion, had stressed the need to hold the forthcoming election under the new system with amendments and added that most of the party leaders had objected to it saying that the PC elections should not be postponed until the amendments were made but held under the previous system.
He said they had agreed to finalize the matter on April 19 when they are due to meet again. (Ajith Siriwardana and Indika Sri Aravinda)

16 resigned SLFP Ministers will not leave Yahapalana Govt immediately: SB
	
Though 16 SLFP Cabinet Ministers, State and Deputy Ministers resigned from their portfolios following the voting in favour of the ?No Confidence Motion? against Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, they would not leave the ?Yahapalana Government? immediately, they said today.
Kandy District UPFA Parliamentarian, former Social Empowerment, Welfare and Upcountry Development Minister S.B. Dissanayaka told the media at the SLFP party office that the group decided to leave the ?Unity Government? on Wednesday night and inform their decision to President Maithripala Sirisena.
Mr. Dissnayaka said no one in the group intended to leave the government until the SLFP Central Committee (CC) decides their fate. The CC is to meet after the New Year after President Maithripala Sirisena returns from the overseas trip on April 22.
He said not only the 16 who voted for the NCM but all SLFP Ministers who abstained must also resign from their portfolios.
?I don?t think they have a moral right to remain in the government with their portfolios. We all 41 members of the SLFP must stick together as single unit that supports President Sirisena. They must resign from the cabinet and let the UNP to form its own government high-handedly because the Yahapalana Government? is in tatters now,? he emphasized.
Mr. Dissanayaka said the 16 SLFP members would support all people friendly and progressive actions of the government and vehemently oppose if and when a policy or project unfriendly comes from the government.
He added that the group of 16 would not join the joint opposition if the CC decides that they should leave the unity government.
?We act as an independent SLFP group in the opposition in Parliament under President Sirisena?s leadership. We never leave him and weaken him,? he stressed.
?We joined the government on the approval of the Central Committee of the SLFP and on the invitation of President Sirisena and therefore we must leave following the same procedure,? he said.
The SLFP joined the ?Yahapalana Government? with a mission. All SLFP members who joined the government wanted to fulfil the aspirations of the people. We wanted to put an end to nepotism, financial crimes, restore rule of law, strengthen democratic establishments, provide relief to the people and find answers to allegations levelled against Sri Lanka by the global community. Some of the objectives were achieved with the introduction of the 19th Amendment to the Constitution like pruning excessive powers of the Executive President, establishing Independent Commissions etc. But unfortunately, certain UNP Ministers had other ideas. They started to amass ill lucre using their power, sell state assets and engaging in various misdeeds. A foreigner was appointed to the post of Central Bank Governor disregarding the protests by President Sirisena. The damage and stigma caused from the Central Bank bond scam is history now. The Economic Management Committee was in charge of almost all the major development projects. More than 8 Acts did not go to Parliament for approval as PM?s office did not consent to them. We miserably failed to fulfil the pledges given to the people by President Sirisena and the SLFP. That is why we wanted to bring a NCM against the Prime Minister,? Mr. Dissanayaka stressed.
He added that however, the idea of bringing a NCM against Prime Minister first came from the UNP backbenchers and we had a few discussions with them on the matter. Many of the allegations levelled by UNPers were similar to that of ours. That is why we decided to vote for the NCM. Most of the allegations contained in the NCM were based on the recommendations of the report by the SLFP?s 11 member Parliamentary group led by Minister Nimal Siripala De Silva,? he said.
The rebellion against Mr. Wickremesinghe intensified within the UNP after the LG polls. However, the country is the ultimate victim of this development. The country cannot go forward with these inter-party and intra-party rivalry, he added.
The question and answer session that ensued at this stag is as follows:
Daily Mirror: If you moved this No Faith Motion with such support from both parties, how it ended a total flop giving a major victory to Prime Minister Wickremesinghe?
Kurunegala District SLFP Parliamentarian Dayasiri Jayasekara: That is the question. There were 22 UNP backbenchers to support the motion.
Daily Mirror: But all assessments changed dramatically on the 4th of April favouring Mr. Wickremesinge.
Mr. Jayasekara: Yes, what the TNA told us on voting day was that they would abstain. We had a long discussion at the residence of UPFA General Secretary and Fisheries and Aquatic resources Development Minister Mahindananda Amaraweera in the morning on the 4th. We were of the view that all were going to vote for the motion and win it.
Daily Mirror: But suddenly all changed. How and why?
Mr. Jayasekara: That is what we also cannot understand. There have been unforeseen or peculiar development that changed the heart of members who were to vote against Mr. Wickremesinghe.
National List SLFP Parliamentarian Dilan Perera: Yes, the change of heart is quite peculiar. There may be things that led to it which we cannot reveal here.
Mr. Jayasekara: I think they will come to open before long.
Journalist: You think all SLFPers must leave the government.
Mr. Jayasekara: Yes indeed. It is not proper for them to keep one leg in the UNP and the other in the SLFP. We in the SLFP have a responsibility towards the people who voted us.
Journalist: Are you against those who are with the government?.
Mr. Jayasekara: If we are to protect the SLFP, we must leave the government.
Mr. Dilan Pererea: Not at all. They are SLFPers and our blood relations. We want to save them from this disaster.
Galle District SLFP Parliamentarian Chandima Weerakkody: We are responsible to our voters. They will curse us if we remained in the unity government any further. They think we are also in cahoots with all wrong doings of the UNP.
Daily Mirror: Do you admit if I say that the NCM was a disaster for the JO and you.
Mr. Perera, Yes, it was a flop because of various unseen developments.
Deputy Speaker Thilanga Sumathipala. Let the UNP form its own government. Let?s see how the UNP is going to introduce a new Constitution and all other Acts they want to enact.
Journalist: Are you still the Deputy Speaker.
Deputy Speaker Sumathipala: Technically yes. My position is decided by members of Parliament. However, I wrote to Speaker Karu Jayasuriya last night about my intentions to resign from the post of Deputy Speaker. The next session in Parliament after the New Year must elect a new Deputy Speaker.
Mr. Perera: The election of a Deputy Speaker will be interesting one. Obviously, the UNP has the support of 122 members in Parliament as we witnessed at the NCM vote. Let?s see how the government is going to elect a Deputy Speaker they want. (Sandun A Jayasekera)

Self-introspection
	
I just thought of briefly inscribing a few lines on taking account of one?s own life.? ?In other words, take time to reflect upon yourself inwardly and wisely scrutinize on your own deeds, words, thoughts and feelings.? ?
Life as a human being is very significant. Numerous capabilities and abilities are endowed and gifted. The most distinguished factor is the mind. The ordinary human being is capable and able to cultivate and develop numerous wholesome inner qualities. The nature of the ordinary human mind is subject to grasps and accumulates innumerable mental toxics and impurities. The mind becomes very impure. An impure and defiled mind is very obscure. Such a mind easily associates with anger, jealousy, hatred and some other cruel thoughts. Unknowingly it leads to psychopathic characters in people. Some people have become psychologically extremely sick. Those who do not take medication for their psychopathic changes are the worst individuals. They are not capable of controlling and managing their anger.??
An impure and defiled mind is very obscure. Such a mind easily associates with anger, jealousy, hatred and some other cruel thoughts. Unknowingly it leads to psychopathic characters in people. Some people have become psychologically extremely sick
They always act and talk as perfect beings. They do not accept and do not take responsibility for their mistakes. They pass them to others. They always seek others faults but not their own. Psychopaths always thinks they are supreme and let others down. They never see the positive or good side of others.? ?
But wise and intelligent human beings concentrate on their own behaviour. They wisely operate and exercise their verbal, physical and mental activities. They do not hurt and harm others. Wise people concentrate on consequences of their action before they act. They are deeply mindful of their own actions before they perform and commit them.? ?
Once the Buddha, the Blessed one, asked Venerable Rahula thus: What is the purpose of a mirror? Then, he said: for the purpose of reflection.? ?
Then the Blessed One advised thus: an action with body should be done after repeated reflection, an action by speech should be done after repeated reflection, and an action by mind should be done after repeated reflection? if that action leads to one?s own affliction or to the affliction of others or to the affliction of both, our Master kindly has advised us to not commit such an action.? ?
One?s own introspection is the profound examination and analysis. If someone honestly excogitate on one?s own inner behaviour with a great deal of changing the manner which mostly discloses in words and deeds, will encourage correcting and rectifying in a righteous way that leads to true peace and happiness.? ?
Presently, most members in our human family celebrate annual celebrations according to their own credences and ideologies. We all must respect and appreciate the way they still continue with unchanging attitude and traditions. In fact, there are hidden treasures in some practices which pave the way to cultivate kindness, compassion and respect but most of them blindly follow it. Unfortunately some of them destructively criticize without any knowledge and understanding.? ?
Born Buddhists and Hindus celebrate their New Year in the middle of April. In Sri Lanka, it is a tremendous and extraordinary celebration. They spend an enormous amount of their own income that is hard earned, on clothes, food, alcohol and gifts. Unfortunately most Sinhalese cannot celebrate anything without alcohol. Even though they foolishly boast about Buddhism or their superior culture what they practice is contrary to what they preach.? ?
They observe and promise themselves not to violate precepts and rules in front of their own children and parents. Some matured people, along with their parents and children absurdly and imprudently violate them, showing their own disgraceful act, contrary to what they articulate and advise others. Unfortunately, pragmatically some people are very inefficient and incapable to practice what they promise for themselves.? ?
A ludicrous and ridiculous fact is that they verbally observe precepts and on the contrary, they violate the precepts numerous times in day-to-day life. Most demonstrative and show off people pretend that they are committed. They assume and simulate that they are the most knowledgeable and live according to rules and regulations what religious Masters defined, but in reality they ruin themselves. They are the worst enemies who spoil and destroy our future generation.? ?
Now the time has arrived to look inward for every one of their own acts, mentality, thoughts, feelings, how they treat others, what refined language they speak with others, how they address others, how polite you are, do you verbally hurt or physically harm others, are you jealous of others, are you happy about others? achievements and accomplishments, are you strong enough to tolerate others? mistakes, do you discriminate others, do you tolerate others beliefs, faiths and culture, and so on.? ?
This is the time for you to take into consideration your own behaviour and conduct. You may be young, educated, healthy and wealthy but unpredictable contingencies and unavoidable circumstances will inform you that your life is expired.? ?
Wholesome mental energy is the vital factor that we all must accumulate by cleansing and purifying one?s own mind. If your own deep rooted wholesome consciousness attests that you are virtuous and righteous, you will be led to a happy and secured destination hereafter.? ?
You are completely responsible for yourself. One is utterly accountable for oneself. Therefore, one?s every single verbal, mental and physical action should be purely and exclusively virtuous and righteous. Whatever the action you carry out, both physical and verbal are your own. You are utterly accountable and answerable for your deeds.? ?
Wise and intelligent human beings concentrate on their own behaviour. They wisely operate and exercise their verbal, physical and mental activities. They do not hurt and harm others. Wise people concentrate on consequences of their action before they act. They are deeply mindful of their own actions before they perform and commit them
Human rights and equal rights are the most crucial and exigent issues in our global society today. Individually, multitudes of people hold discussions and criticize as they wish according to their political partiality and personal propensity. But people are rarely concerned about their own individual vicinities and nuclear families, such as home, office, school, working place and so on. This is a very pivotal and significant fact which most people have forgotten.? ?
Numerous shocking stories and disgusting reports disclose that many individuals agonise their own partners and children in our human society. They may avoid the state punishment but the karma definitely will never allow them to take a by-pass. Karma will certainly and categorically prescribe and provide the same dose.? ?
Be kind and wise to concentrate on your own duties and responsibilities on your own.? ?
Reflection must be thoroughly focused on one?s own family. Not materially but emotionally.? ?
Then you will be happy to say that I am kind and generous. I am virtuous?and righteous.? ?
?Mind precedes all mental states. Mind is their chief; they are all mind-wrought. If with an impure mind a person speaks or acts, suffering follows him like the wheel that follows the foot of the ox.?
?(Dhammapada.)? ?
?How people treat you is their Karma,?how you react is yours?

Those who voted against Premier can?t remain in Cabinet
	
Minister of Education Akila Viraj Kariyawasam spoke about the future of the Unity Government, the UNP that?s shrouded with controversies and the resignation of Minister Kabir Hashim from the post of General Secretary of the Green Party among many hot topics in an interview with our sister paperDeshaya.? ?
Excerpts:?
Q After having defeated the no confidence motion what is the next imminent threat??
Certainly it was not a threat. The no confidence motion against the Prime Minister was not actually a threat. From the beginning we were confident that it could be easily defeated. Those who brought the motion in parliament are viewing the rising sun every morning. The sun has not stopped rising with the defeating of the motion going by what they boasted through the media. All of our parliamentarians voted against it. We were able to obtain the support of the other parties too.? ?
Q But it was not so easy to defeat the no confidence motion as you say. Some UNP ministers and MPs supported the Prime Minister on the promise of restructuring the UNP. Don?t you think that keeping to this promise has brought about another threat??
According to what we have agreed to the party reorganisation activities are now in progress.? ?
Q Is the resignation of Minister Kabir Hashim as UNP General Secretary a step towards the intended reform??
It might be. But I am not certain about that.? ?
The Premier has already made arrangements to recover the possible loss from those responsible for it. As for the appointment an individual with the maximum qualification was appointed for the post regarding this matter
Q Is it a preliminary step towards reorganising the party where your are to be appointed as the General Secretary??
It is one of the changes proposed. However the party would decide on these things.? ?
Q Your reply indicates the possibility of you becoming the Secretary General of the UNP.Your comments?
?Some MPs want to make this proposal, but it is left to the party to decide.? ?
Q There is opposition to your nomination as General Secretary. Do you think you would be able to function in this capacity amidst these differences in view??
Certainly, I am confident. I am already the Deputy General Secretary of the party and have held several posts within the party. Even now I am performing a very responsible task as the Minister of Education.? ?
Q SLFP MPs were shrouded in a controversy when the no confidence motion in parliament was taken for vote. Do you think the Government can move forward despite these controversies??
We will solve these problems through negotiations. The Prime minister will meet the President and we would be able to reach a settlement.? ?
Q On the day the motion was debated 23 MPs submitted a letter requesting the removal of 16 government ministers who voted in favour of the NCM. Your comments??
It is not ethical for the ministers to remain in the government after voting in favour of the motion which was against the prime minister. The collective responsibility among Cabinet ministers is very important. If they remain in the Cabinet it is only for the privileges.? ?
Q That may be your opinion. But the Prime Minister says that he will have a discussion with the President on how to continue with the unity government. Your comments?
Continuing with the Unity Government is not a problem. In the discussion held with the Premier, the ministers opposed to keep these SLFP members in the Cabinet. Minister Rajitha Senaratne even expressed his displeasure to sit in the Cabinet with the opposing SLFP Ministers.? ?
Q Are you preparing for a protest in the cabinet??
Not necessarily. Given that most of the ministers are from the United National Front, the Prime Minister will discuss the matter with the President.? ?
Continuing with the Unity Government is not a problem. In the discussion held with the Premier, the ministers opposed to keep these SLFP members in the Cabinet
Q When there is a strong opposition against the presence of the defying SLFP ministers in Cabinet what is the Prime Minister?s response?
His views are also the same that these SLFP ministers can?t be part of the Government. However he also wants to see the Unity Government continue. There are many SLFP ministers who refrained from voting during the no confidence motion. The majority of our ministers have expressed their willingness to continue working with these SLFP ministers and MPs. The Prime minister also agrees with this point of view.? ?
Q The SLFP ministers who voted in favour of the motion have maintained that they do not intend to resign from their ministerial posts.Your comments?
19 amendments to the Constitution specify the powers given to the President and the Prime Minister. The powers of the President are now different when compared with the previous Constitution. Time will bring a solution to the problem.? ?
Q The SLFP was divided during the vote taken on the motion. In what manner did the President help you during this motion??
He remained independent regarding the motion and did not ask members to vote for or against. We consider the motion as a decision of the SLFP. The President made a request to leave him out of the matter.? ?
Q Are you saying that there is no dispute between the President and the Prime Minister?
Certainly not.? ?
Q Some say that bags full of money were on offer to win over those who were to vote in favour of the motion. Is it true?
Utter lies. It is they who robbed and gave Rs.500,000 for each candidate during the last Provincial Council Elections.? ?
Q Leave aside the bags full of money. You have agreed to some of the demands made by the TNA to obtain their votes against the motion. Your comments?
The TNA is a political party responsible for its people. There were some practical problems that they were facing. We are obliged to solve these problems. Members of the TNA cannot be bought over for money.? ?
Q Thirteen charges out of fourteen presented during the motion are related to Central Bank Bond issue. Why can?t the Government solve this problem??
We have taken every necessary step regarding this matter. Even the Bond Commission had not found anything against the Prime Minister. The Premier has already made arrangements to recover the possible loss from those responsible for it. As for the appointment an individual with the maximum qualification was appointed for the post regarding this matter. Now the legal process is continuing.? ?
However, there is an acute bond issue which has surfaced since 2008 and amounts to Rs.4,000 billion. There is nobody to talk about these matters nor are there commissions to investigate this issue.? ?
Q However it is your responsibility to investigate into these matters. Negligence on your part has led to these losses.Your comments?
There are reasons affecting the delay. Some officials appointed by the Rajapaksa Government still hold the same positions. Soon we would rectify the problems associated with these positions.We agree that there are some matters we have left unattended.? ?
Q But your excuse of palming all the problems on Rajapaksa is not acceptable. Isn?t this your Government?
We can?t work arbitrarily. We have to comply with legal procedures. There are doubts regarding some matters.? ?
Q Minister Rajitha Senaratne has spoken about a new Cabinet to be appointed immediately. Your response?
The President and Prime Minister will decide on a new Cabinet.? ?
Q The Joint Opposition says that it has deprived the Government of enjoying a two-thirds majority. Would it be possible for you to get bills passed in the future.??
We still retain a two-thirds majority. Some were absent during the vote? of no confidence which was their way of supporting us. We are confident of having the support of 150 members in the Parliament.??
Q Do you mean that the Government has the continuous support of the TNA?? ?
They (TNA) will offer their support for the good bills.They also supported the president so that he could come to power.? ?
Q Minister Susil Premajayantha has made a strong charge against the Government. It is so serious.What is your response?
There are also allegations against him. Some MPs have asked him to discuss this matter internally in the Cabinet before speaking to the public.? ?
There are many SLFP ministers who refrained from voting during the no confidence motion. The majority of our ministers have expressed their willingness to continue working with these SLFP ministers and MPs?
Q However the Local Government Election has left the Government wobbling, like never before. Your comments?
The reason for the defeat is the SLFP. They distorted the campaign. Amid these problems we were able to secure the January 8 mandate. Rajapaksas were not able to get 45% of the votes. We are determined to form our own Government in future.? ?
Q Unlike in the past there is confusion within the Government. Your comments?? ?
There were problems within and the Prime Minister introduced many development projects. However they could not be implemented due to obstructions by members of the SLFP.? ?
Q Did the Government prevent frauds from taking place?? ?
That is what we understand. We also have come to understand that some of them have been protected.??
