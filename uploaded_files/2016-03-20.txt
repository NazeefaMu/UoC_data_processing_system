CMC to get facelift with proposed Museum
	
A part of the Colombo Municipality building in Town Hall is to be converted into a museum, archiving vital documents and other valued equipment used during the inception of the council.
The museum, still in its planning phase, is expected to be set up after a number of public service departments are shifted to the new building which is under construction.
The new administrative block, estimated at Rs. 860 million, will be declared open in July,sources said.
Speaking to the Daily Mirror previously, officials said the offices and departments were temporarily shifted and a number of makeshift buildings were demolished to make way for the new building.
The design for the new building was selected through an architecture competition.
Colombo Mayor A. J. M. Muzammil previously stated that approval for constructing the building had been dragging on for two years.
?We have been striving to attend to this since 2013. We don?t have enough space here. Most of our offices are crammed in small spaces, and the number of residents in Colombo had increased over the years. We have 6,000- 7,000 people working here. We need more space and more facilities such as conference halls and auditoriums,? he said. (Piyumi Fonseka)

German tech to look into transformer explosions
	
A team of German technicians are scheduled to arrive in Sri Lanka tomorrow (21) to investigate the two unusual explosions at the Biyagama Grid Sub Station and the Kotugoda CEB Grid Sub Station recently, the Power and Renewable Energy Ministry said.
Secretary to the Ministry Dr. Suren Batagoda said the transformers were manufactured in Germany and therefore the German team would investigate the unusual occurrence.
?They assured the transformers would not explode. The team is looking into whether it was a technical issue or sabotage,? he said.
Earlier Dr. Batagoda said engineers were unable to determine the cause of the explosions. How, both transformers exploded in the same fashion amidst the security in the sub stations in Biyagama and Kotagoda was suspicious, he said.
An unusual explosion at the electricity transformer yard in Biyagama caused an island-wide blackout plunging the country into darkness last Sunday for eight hours.
Several days after the explosion at the Biyagama Grid Sub Station, another transformer at the Kotugoda CEB Grid Sub Station in Minuwangoda, has also exploded.? (Darshana Sanjeewa)

Govt. to revive diesel power plants
	
The government is planning to revive diesel power plants which were shut down last year after the Norochcholai Coal Power Plant started generating power to the national grid.
According to the Power and Renewable Energy Ministry sources, around 300 diesel power plants in several areas, including Embilipitiya, Puttalam, Matara and Horana were shut down last year.
The ministry Secretary Suren Batagoda said the decision was taken following the lack of hydro power generation due to continuous dry weather.
?We shut down all the expensive diesel power plants after the Norochcholai Coal Power Plant started adding 900 MW to the national power grid. We were contemplating on what we could do in case of a lack of power production. The private companies-owned diesel power plants are the solution we chose,? he said.
The Ministry had informed the private companies to gear up diesel power generating capacity. (Piyumi Fonseka)

Hands off SL war heroes: Champika
	
The Jathika Hela Urumaya (JHU) will not allow war heroes to be questioned by the international community under any circumstances as long as the party is a part of the government, Minister of Megapolis and Western Development Patali Champika Ranawaka said.
Minister Ranawaka made these observations at the JHU?s People?s Forum held at Ape Gama in Battaramulla on Saturday.
Emphasizing that the path of the United National Front is far from being a cake walk, the minister said the legacy of the previous regime continues to hamper the progressive moves of the present government.
?Even after being rejected by people at two consecutive elections last year the leaders of the Rajapaksa regime are over-ambitious to admit defeat. They think this country is their private property and try to regain power by hook or by crook. They can?t stand someone else leading this country,? the minister observed.
??The year 2020 is going to be a crucial one with two elections on the cards. It?s the JHU and other broadminded patriots that would decide as to who would form the next parliament and be elected the next President,? he added.

Indian Police likely to seek Interpol help to probe SL link to kidney racket
	
Investigators of the Indian Special Investigation Team (SIT) have hinted that it could seek help from the Interpol to probe the link into the kidney extractions carried out in Sri Lanka, after following the due procedure of law.
The SIT, formed by Anand District Superintendent of Police Ashok Kumar Yadav to probe into the kidney racket of Pandoli village, has fanned across to Delhi and Mumbai to trace the timeline of the alleged organ extractions as well as ?big fish? involved in the racket.
Investigators say that the documents have also confirmed that more than five persons travelled to Sri Lanka with help from ?agents? to sell their kidneys. In what could escalate into an international racket, the Anand police are looking at seeking help from the Interpol to probe the Sri Lanka link. A senior investigating officer said, ?More than five people from Pandoli have travelled to Sri Lanka for kidney extractions via Chennai, with help of agents. There are high chances that we will report this international link to the Centre and seek help from the Interpol after following the procedure of law. With help from Interpol, we will be able to probe this link.?
Petlad Deputy Superintendent of Police, M R Gupta, is heading the SIT. Its two teams are currently in Delhi and Mumbai to locate the network of the racket. A 27-year-old cattle trader from Pindoli, Aamir Malik, had alleged that another villager, Rafiq Vora, had ?cheated? him into selling off his kidney to a Delhi hospital in February this year. A team of officers, along with one of the three arrested accused, are currently probing the sequence of events and the other touts involved in the transaction that earned Aamir Rs 2.3 lakh for one kidney. Another team of Anand investigators is in Mumbai to probe the link between a kidney donor, Poonam Solanki, from Pandoli in a 2001 case ? the transplant of which, occurred in the Muljibhai Patel Urological Hospital (MPUH) in Nadiad. Senior officials added that the SIT will also question the recipients of the two the kidney transplants conducted at the Nadiad hospital regarding their link to their donors. ?It will help us get to the touts who lure the naive villages with money.?
The MPUH authorities have clarified that the hospital had, on its own accord, requested the police to initiate a probe into another suspicious case in 2002. The recipient and donor of that case were acquitted by the Gujarat High Court in 2008.(Indian Express)

The president said these leaders of joint opposition know about the international support this government is getting from the international community and cannot bear it up.
??They say we surrender to other countries when we get into agreements with various countries and let me assure that the government will never surrender itself to any country" president said. He said the people will be able to see the benefits of international agreements the government had got into in a year. (Yohan Perera)
