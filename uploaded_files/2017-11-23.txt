Ajith appeals Speaker to mediate
	
UNP MP and Deputy Minister Ajith P. Perera yesterday made an appeal to Speaker Karu Jayasuriya to mediate to get the details of the telephone conversations from the Presidential Commission of Inquiry into the issuance of Central bank bonds and get an opportunity to cross-examine the witness claiming that the commission had informed him that it did not have any details pertaining to the calls he alleged to have made to Arjun Aloysius.
He said in Parliament that in reply to his letter to the Commission, it had informed him that the commission did not have the date, time that the calls connected or the content of those conversations.
He said the Commission had refused to give him an opportunity to listen to him due to time constraints.
"I think they have made a mistake here. But I have no chance to declare my innocence and my honesty. I have never acted to protect thieves. I have spoken against those involved in the bond scam within the COPE. This is a black mark for my reputation as a politician and a professional," he said. (Ajith Siriwardana)

Deporting British Tourist with a Budda Tattoo a case of acting without knowing the law
	
Coleman receives compensation, claims will never return to Lanka
?
Tourism is one of those sectors that immensely contributes to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in the country. Immediately after the war, several plans were implemented to boost tourism in Sri Lanka and from then on wards, this island was marked on the world map as a tourism hot spot. Naomi Michelle Coleman was one of 144,168 tourists who visited Sri Lanka in 2014. Contrary to pleasant memories gathered while in Sri Lanka by other tourists, Naomi?s encounter was unpleasant and horrible. Naomi or any other tourist for that matter wouldn?t have expected a sporting a tattoo of The Buddha on the right upper arm would take a foreigner to the point of being deported from the country.? ?
The Supreme Court announced that Naomi wasn?t at fault and she was awarded compensation amounting to a figure between Rs. 800,000 ? Rs 600,000 another Rs. 200,000 to cover costs
But three years later, the Supreme Court announced that Naomi wasn?t at fault and she was awarded compensation amounting to a figure between Rs. 800,000 ? Rs 600,000 another Rs. 200,000 to cover costs. During the case, a magistrate issued a notice for her deportation without the consultation of the Subject Minister nor the Embassy. The judgment further specified that there had been a breach of fundamental rights and that a magistrate couldn?t take such a decision. ?I don?t think I will ever return to Sri Lanka as there may be people who would want to harm me,? Naomi told the Daily Mirror.
The incident?
Naomi had just arrived in Sri Lanka after travelling from India. She was expecting her friend, who was arriving from the UK. She therefore had to collect her from the airport that afternoon. According to Naomi, this incident obviously wouldn?t have happened if she didn?t have to obtain the services of a taxi driver, who she identified as Kelum Chaminda, and a bystander, who had picked her up. Things had got a little unpleasant when he observed the tattoo and he wanted to take her to the Police instead to the airport. But she had managed to send her friend a text which she fortunately saw when she had arrived. They were then supposed to travel to Maldives after a week in Sri Lanka.? ?
According to her, the duo had taken her to Katunayake Police Station where the Acting OIC had confiscated her passport and produced her in court without specifying charges. She wasn?t afforded an opportunity to communicate nor inform the British High Commission about her arrest.? ?
She said she was introduced to an Attorney by a prison guard, but she had no opportunity to give instructions to the Attorney. However she was asked to pay Rs. 5000 as the fee.? ?
According to her, the prison guard who was in charge of her, while being behind bars at the court room, had made several lewd, obscene and disparaging remarks which were sexually inclined. When her case concluded, her attorney informed her that she would be deported, regardless of her entreaties. She was also told that she would be permitted to leave for Maldives and till then would be detained at a deportation centre in Nugegoda.??
?I will never return to Sri Lanka??-Naomi Coleman
Naomi Michelle Coleman has been working as a mental health support worker in Coventry for the past 16 years. She travels on a regular basis and has attended Buddhist retreats in India, Thailand and Nepal. She has also undertaken volunteer work with disadvantaged children in these countries. Her last visit in Sri Lanka, back in 2014, was her third in the island.? ?
I am happy with the outcome of the case and it proves that I wasn?t at fault. The whole situation was handled badly and I was very frightened
Speaking to the Daily Mirror, Naomi shared her experience and what she felt about the verdict.? ?
Q As a tourist, how do you feel when recalling the incident and what it turned out to be in the end?
I am happy with the outcome of the case and it proves that I wasn?t at fault. The whole situation was handled badly and I was very frightened as I didn?t know what was going to happen to me. I am glad that it has been acknowledged that the police officers are at fault and they have been asked to pay a fee.
No one spoke with me in English and I was relying on a taxi driver to communicate. The next thing I knew was that I was just taken to a court after waiting for hours and seeing my passport being taken away from me. I thank the rational thinking people in Sri Lanka for their great support and the lawyers JC Weliamuna, Vishwa, Thishya and Hafeel for offering to take my case without charging legal fees and fighting the case for over 3 years.? ?
I am unsure why the verdict took so long. Initially the judge presiding over the case was taken ill and then another judge was assigned. The case had been heard over several times during the past three and a half years.? ?
Q Have you had similar encounters in other countries as well?
I have never had an encounter like this in any other country. My tattoo is a symbol of peace and compassion and represents my travels to Buddhist countries and the lessons I have learned from Buddhist monks.? ?
Q Are you still being harassed?
I know of one person who is making an issue out of the verdict on social media, but I know in my heart that I wasn?t in the wrong and I follow a Buddhist path. These people don?t know me nor do they know what kind of person I am.?
I know Buddhist symbols should be above the waist and that?s what I have done
Q What is your message to fellow tourists and Sri Lankan authorities?
Sri Lanka is a beautiful country, however I won?t be able to return due to the small percentage of people that would still wish to harm me. I know Buddhist symbols should be above the waist and that?s what I have done as well, so I?m not disrespecting the Buddhist culture.? ?
Fellow tourists, just be mindful if you have a tattoo of The Buddha as there is a small percentage of extremists who could create a huge problem. Also if you take a picture in front of a Buddha statue that seems to create an issue in Sri Lanka, but not in other Buddhist countries. Other than that the beaches and Buddhist sites are must-visit places.??
?Police officers should follow the judgment and study the laws? - Ruwan Gunasekara
According to Police Media Spokesman Ruwan Gunasekara, once a Supreme Court judgment is given it becomes a binding law. ?From there on wards Police officers have been asked to follow the judgment and study the laws accordingly. We can?t train Police officers every time a judgment is given. There are two parts to a law: Ratio decidendi ? the point in a case where the judgment is given and Obiter dictum ? a judge?s expression of opinion stated in courts. This isn?t the official decision. So usually the Ratio decidendi becomes the law and we have trained Police officers to abide by the law during these circumstances,? the police spokesman said.
?The dignity of a person is of utmost importance? - Dr.Prathiba Mahanamahewa
Dr. Prathiba Mahanamahewa, Human rights lawyer and former Commissioner of the Sri Lanka Human Rights Council, said that when the Police conduct investigations they should consider the dignity of a person. ?When dealing with tourists we also have to think about the country?s image. Therefore before Police officers take action regarding an issue which has legal consequences, they should consult Senior officials and carry out their investigations accordingly.
We see Buddhist symbols everywhere and then in that case even wearing a Dharmachakra is an offence. People wear tattoos depending on their preferences and we can?t take it as an offence. She had no intention of degrading the religion and therefore she can?t be at fault. It?s only if someone is intentionally defaming a religion that some action should be taken against it. In this situation, the Embassy should have been informed and they should have been consulted, but everything was blown out of proportion. The Police should learn to treat people in a humane way,?said Mahanamahewa.
?Everybody is equal before the law? - Thishya Weragoda
Speaking to the? Attorney-at-Law Thishya Weragoda, one of the lawyers who appeared for Naomi, said that three years is relatively an improvement when compared to other verdicts which drag on for five years or more. ?Regarding this incident a random person had created havoc and the Policemen seemed to have acted irresponsibly. What the Police should have done first was to disperse the crowd and made her explain what had gone wrong. They could have escorted her to a hotel, but instead they decided to deport her. I believe this is the first such case where a foreigner was involved,? said Weragoda.? ?
Regarding this incident a random person had created havoc and the Policemen seemed to have acted irresponsibly
Speaking further Weragoda said that everybody is equally treated by the law. ?We followed Articles 11, 12 and 13 which addresses freedom of speech and equal treatment to all. The Police too has misrepresented facts in court which has resulted in the story being twisted in different places. It?s only if a person is convicted that a magistrate can deport him or her. I believe that the magistrate too should be more cautious and must understand the situation first. Also the Police too should train their subordinates to handle situations in a diplomatic manner without trying to earn extra bucks. It?s disrespectful to see such occurrences and in this case it involved a tourist.?
Therefore all Police officers have to be properly trained before a badge is pinned on them. We also have a Constitution which is 40 years old and that too should be revamped immediately,?said Weragoda.??

DPA, 22nd NOVEMBER, 2017- Lebanese Prime Minister Saad Hariri put his resignation on hold, more than two weeks after saying he would step down from office.
?I offered my resignation today to President [Michel] Aoun, he asked me to wait on it and I agreed,? Hariri said on Wednesday in a brief statement after a closed door meeting with Aoun.
House speaker Nabih Berri also attended?the meeting.
Hariri said postponing the resignation will allow for a serious dialogue within the country.
Hariri arrived in Beirut late Tuesday more than two weeks after he announced his resignation while in Saudi Arabia. Aoun refused to accept his resignation until he returned?to Beirut.
Prior to the meeting with Aoun, Hariri attended a military parade to mark the 74th anniversary of Lebanon?s independence?on Wednesday.
His shock announcement of resignation led to a political crisis and raised international fears that Lebanon is being caught in a proxy feud between Saudi Arabia and its regional rival Iran, after Hariri accused Iran and its allies of plotting to have him assassinated.

Macron?s first budget sparks EU warning
	
?
BRUSSELS AFP Nov22, 2017- The EU warned Wednesday that French President Emmanuel Macron?s first budget risked breaking its tough spending rules, despite his efforts to lower the deficit and earn credibility for his ambitious reform plans for the bloc.??
Brussels singled out the six eurozone nations of France, Belgium, Italy, Austria, Portugal and Slovenia as being on course for breaching EU regulations on government deficits.??
The European Commission also sounded the alarm over Italy?s high levels of government debt, saying that it was a cause of concern for the 19-country eurozone as a whole.??
??The main message to France is the importance of correction of (the) excessive deficit this year,? Valdis Dombrovskis, the commission vice president responsible for the euro, told AFP in an interview ahead of the release of its assessment of EU states? draft budget plans.??
Macron has vowed to reduce public overspending in the eurozone?s second largest economy with tough reforms and spending cuts, and French lawmakers approved his first annual budget with a thumping majority on Tuesday.??

Missing Argentine submarine located by the US Navy
	
?
DAILY MAIL, 22nd NOVEMBER, 2017 - The missing Argentine submarine may have been located early this morning, after a US Navy aircraft allegedly detected a ?heat stain? from 230ft below the surface, some 185miles from the coast, and a rescue vessel separately reported hearing a sonar signal.
The ARA San Juan was sailing from Ushuaia to Mar del Plata when it disappeared with 44 crew members last Wednesday, including Argentina?s first female submariner Eliana Krawczyk, 35, and Luis Niz, 25, who is due to get married in two weeks time.
The crew?s oxygen supply was due to run out this morning as they only had enough on board to last seven days - leaving the international rescue mission racing against time to the spot where the signals were detected.
Experts, however, said it was possible that the diesel-electric submarine?s oxygen supply might last as many as ten days in the case of a battery failure as reported by the boat?s captain in his last communication.
The Argentine navy?s spokesman, Capt. Enrique Balbi, said yesterday: ?The seven days is not dogmatic. It varies according to the circumstances.??

Sarvodaya Development Finance records Rs.28mn net profit in 1H
	
?
Sarvodaya Development Finance has shown significant growth based on the 6 months financial results ending 30th September 2017.?
The company has recorded a significant growth in terms of net profit after tax in 2017, compared to the corresponding period of the previous financial year.?
The year 2017 has marked a year of accomplishment and impactful growth for Sarvodaya Finance, the financial services arm of the Sarvodaya Movement, thrusting the company towards the forefront of Sri Lanka?s microfinance sector.?
Commenting on the significant growth achieved by Sarvodaya Finance, Chairman of Sarvodaya Development Finance Limited Channa de Silva underscored that the company has successfully transitioned from a basic micro finance firm to a fully-fledged financial institution, involved in funding leasing, SMEs, personal loans and pawning.?
?Going beyond the ordinary banking norms, we have constantly strived to empower people from the grassroots. Our profits are circulated through Sarvodaya Movement to empower rural communities and fund numerous social service programs. We offer loans for beneficiaries in rural and urban communities for conveniently affordable rates. During calamities such as floods and drought, we have always been in the forefront to support the affected businesses in times of need. We have also taken steps to empower entrepreneurs, and thereby create jobs that could strengthen and elevate their finances, living standards as well as education. Furthermore, we conduct leadership training programsto empower youth in the rural areas via Sarvodaya Higher Education Institute,? de Silva said.
After strategically centralizing its back-office operations, Sarvodaya Finance has approached a wider customer-base with a fresh brand image, resulting a prominent growth in business. This has tremendously helped the company to improve overall efficiency and productivity. Standing testimony to its impactful growth, the gross non-performing loan ratio of Sarvodaya Finance has dropped from 13 percent to 9 percent between 2016 and 2017 second quarter. The net non-performing loan ratio has also taken a dip from 4 percent to 2 percent during the same period.

Sharing his views on the occasion, Chief Executive Officer of Sarvodaya Development Finance Limited Dharmasiri Wickramatilake noted that Sarvodaya Finance has recorded a portfolio growth of 15 percent making a remarkable achievement compared to the corresponding period of the previous financial year which accounted for a decline of 2.5 percent.?
He also stated that growth in top line of 38 percent to reach Rs.609 million for the 6 months ending on 30th September, where net profit after tax of Rs.28 million recorded for the six months period has been considered a significant achievement under the circumstances. ?Despite the negative market, we have grown predominantly in SME, leasing and personal loans? he said.
Today Sarvodaya Finance serves with 30 branches and 21 customer service centres, reaching out to the most remote areas in the country and supporting and sustaining the development from the grassroots. The company has taken bold steps to upgrade and relocate its offices under a rigorous marketing drive, extending its customer reach through the stalwart Sarvodaya Movement, to over 1500 societies across the island.

Social Empowerment, Welfare and Kandyan Heritage Minister S. B. Dissanayake today described former Justice and Buddha Sasana Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe as a ?donkey? by saying that his absence had eased the procedures to resolve issues attached to the ?Samurdhi Vyaparaya?.
Minister Dissanayake said that the parties involved with the Samurdhi Vyaparaya hold two separate opinions over the issues related to the Samurdhi Vyaparaya. He said one party was completely against its proceedings.
?This condition is advantageous in several ways. To receive the benefits of this condition, it is necessary to remove former minister Rajapakshe from his post. It is better that ?donkey? is no more functioning in his post. Instead, a friendly minister, Sarath Amunugama has been appointed to oversee it. It is a positive move,? he added.

Ship carrying substandard fuel still at Trinco Port: Ministry
	
The ship, which was rejected by the Lanka Indian Oil Company (LIOC) for carrying a stock of substandard fuel, is still docked at the Trincomalee Port, the Petroleum Resources Development Ministry said recently.
Commenting on this, Ports and Shipping Ministry Media Secretary M.P. Thameera Manju said, ?The ship, still docked at the port, has no intention of taking the stock back. Minister Arjun Ranatunga too seconded this by saying the stock of substandard fuel would not be accepted.?
He said the LIOC had imported a shipment of fuel on October 15, but it had been rejected on October 17 after testing.
Speaking to Daily Mirror, LIOC Managing Director Shyam Bohra said they had nothing to do with the shipment, but the responsibility should be borne by the French multinational company M/s TOTAL that ordered the consignment. He said legal action would be taken against the supplier and that it could even get blacklisted.
While stating that he was unaware as to why the shipment was still docked at the port, Mr. Bohra suspected a delay in clearing documents led to this situation. (Chaturanga Pradeep)

Sujeewa has made a serious mistake by blaming President: Amaraweera
	
UPFA General Secretary and Minister Mahinda Amaraweera today said State Minister Sujeewa Senasinghe has made a serious mistake by blaming the President for appointing the Presidential Commission to probe the Bond issue.
Minister Senasinghe recently said that he was badly disappointed about the President and called on the President to appoint Commissions to inquire into ship deals, MiG deals, spectrum deals and advertising firms.
Addressing the weekly Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) media briefing, Minister Amaraweera said State Minister Senasinghe was not a Cabinet minister and therefore he cannot know what was happening in Cabinet meetings.
?People know that there is no fault at President Sirisena appointing a Commission. If someone is against the Presidential Commissions, that means he is ignoring investigations against frauds. If they are saying that the President was elected on January 8 to continue their frauds, that would never become true. As UPFA we approve the decisions taken by the President,? Minister Amaraweera said. (Chaturanga Pradeep)

Swineetha Weerasinghe: Reflections on  an open canvas
	
There?s a sequence of overpowering lyrical rawness in Welikathara where the protagonist and his wife fight over each other?s pasts; it transforms the plot from a terse, Cape Fear-esque thriller to something pulpier, taking us back to the whodunit pot-boilers of the 1940s and 50s. That sequence was only partly there in the restored version, shown about two months ago to a sadly indifferent audience at the Regal in Colombo, because the first few scenes in it had (for some reason) been cut off. Unfolding right after our protagonist, Wickrema Randeniya (Gamini Fonseka) gets taunted by Goring Mudalali (Joe Abeywickrema), those scenes depict Randeniya?s wife, Geetha, who is angry that her husband has done nothing to get rid of the villain, ominously rejecting his advances. In that act of rejection, the film reaches its climax, and inadvertently betrays its pulpiness.??
This encounter between wife and husband is so claustrophobically shot, with two frames cutting into each other, that owing to its overwhelming CinemaScope format (the first time it was used in South Asia) you almost cynically want them to continue bickering, building up the tensions until Randeniya does the only thing a character played by Gamini Fonseka, at that point in his career, could do to assert himself: Slap the wife and, with the sense of shame it compels in him, project his anger against the antagonist of the story.
Swineetha?s career belongs to a twilight period, the sixties, coming right after Rukmani Devi was acknowledged as the queen of our cinema and before Malini Fonseka became her successor?
Fonseka of course met his match with Goring in Welikathara (it?s a testament to how provocatively and refreshingly novel Joe Abeywickrema was in his portrayal that after one point we don?t root for the hero, we root for him), but that conflict would never have intensified without Geetha. She needed to be depicted in such a way that in the first half she symbolises obedience and respect, and in the second contempt and hatred.? ?
Played by Swineetha Weerasinghe, she embodied both rather well. That has as much to do with the script, by Tissa Abeysekara, as it has with her ability, because the truth is that Swineetha, whom I met several years ago, has always been an intriguing actress, capable of enormous sensitivity without the stereotypes that such artists are forced into. The greatest tribute to the range of emotions and experiences she could evoke, I think, was H. D. Premaratne?s Sikuruliya, where she was transformed from a village damsel, in love with Vijaya Kumaratunga, to a hapless, unhappily married wife of a cruel, dwarfish aristocrat, played by Bandula Galagedara, and then to the fianc?e of a considerably older man, a ruffian, played by Joe. Coming right after Welikathara, Sikuruliya was also a massive success, and it too was shot and screened on CinemaScope. In both we saw Swineetha up-close, and in both we were moved by her complexity, her subtlety.??
Swineetha?s career belongs to a twilight period, the sixties, coming right after Rukmani Devi was acknowledged as the queen of our cinema and before Malini Fonseka became her successor. It was an intermittent period, in which our actresses were taken to portray ordinary women who went about their lives without the need to attract, to be heroic. Swineetha was not alone here, but unlike those other actresses who entered the cinema during that intermittent period (especially Punya Heendeniya) she projected an at-times ambiguous attitude to the patriarchal world she was filmed against.
In the movies of Robin Tampoe (her first screen credit was in a dance item in Suhada Divi Piduma, in 1962, followed by three successive pictures: Sudu Sande Kalu Wala in 1963; Samajaye Api Okkoma Samanai in 1964; and Sudo Sudu, which paired her with Gamini Fonseka, in 1965) she found her niche, as the village damsel who possesses agency and does not genuflect unconditionally before male dominance. As Chitra in Delovak Athara, her first serious outing, she expanded on this quality of hers, dangling between friendliness and hostility with respect to her relationship with the protagonist, Nissanka Wijeratne.??
I once asked Swineetha to list out the names of some actresses she looked up to at that point in her career, after Delovak Athara proved that she could reckon with both commercial and serious movies, and she did: Glenda Jackson, Geraldine Chaplin, Rita Tushingham. It?s far-fetched to suggest that this is enough for us to understand her ?lan but then again these actresses were, and continued to be, symbolic of a new woman, the kind that defied cosmetic innocence for independence, autonomy, defiance. Swineetha?s characters, especially from the late sixties, embodied these values.??
In a way her biography offers some clues as to this contradictory streak in her.
Swineetha was born to a middle class family in Dehiwela. Her father had been a gunman in the British Army; her mother remained a housewife. Educated initially at Buddhist Girls? College in Mt. Lavinia (until the Fifth Standard) and later at Dehiwela Madhya Maha Vidyalaya, she proved herself by winning awards for singing, dancing, athletics, and netball. ?I was never interested in acting as a career,? she informed me, ?But I was interested in medicine. More specifically, indigenous medicine.?
Resolving for a career in that field, therefore, she enrolled herself at the Government Indigenous Medical College. She never completed it; during her third year, she read an advertisement calling for budding actresses, received some flak from her mother and encouragement from her father, answered it, and got the role: in that small dance item in Suhada Divi Piduma.??
It?s a testament to Swineetha?s capability that she has undergone this shift without the usual blasts of emotions that accompany it
Lester James Peries noticed her in Sudo Sudu, which marked one of Robin Tampoe?s rare forays into serious territory (that it failed commercially, as Tissa Abeysekara later wrote, indicated how unfamiliar that serious territory was for him), ?borrowed? her from RT Studios (?Because they weren?t ready to just hand over an actor like her to a director like me who was defying their system,? Lester recounted to me years ago, chortling), and cast her in Delovak Athara in a role meant for the much younger Anula Karunatilake. Ironically, she had begun her career with commercial, mainstream movies, but returned to them only briefly thereafter, preferring the more serious ventures that would get her travelling to various film festivals: to Tashkent (where she met Simi Garewal, Sunil Dutt, Nargis, and Shabana Azmi) and Krakow with Welikathara, and to Tehran (where she met the Shah of Iran and, on his last day before departure, Satyajit Ray) with Hulavali.
Most actresses, as they age, tend to turn themselves into the matriarchs they used to defy in their younger days. It happened with Malini Fonseka; it happened in a more nuanced way with Punya Heendeniya (the difference between her Nanda in Gamperaliya and Kaliyugaya attests to that); and it has happened, to a certain extent, even with that most defiant of on-screen women, Swarna Mallawarachchi (as Age Asa Aga shows).
In their younger days they cried over the men they fantasised about; when they mature and grow wiser they cry when other women fantasise about their husbands. They enthralled us by their sense of daring; now they enthral us by their realisation of how hollow their youthful streak was. It?s a testament to Swineetha?s capability that she has undergone this shift without the usual blasts of emotions that accompany it. Perhaps it?s because of how subtle her acting is, or perhaps it?s because no one has filmed her or made use of her capabilities since the 80s. Either way, you can?t place any of her characters against a specific canvas. They are blissfully pliable, ambivalent, and multidimensional.??
There have, of course, been other actresses, who came during that twilight period I wrote about earlier: Punya, Anula Karunatilake, Swarna Kahawita, Sobani Amarasinghe. But while they either yielded to their fates in their stories or defied them altogether to their cost, Swineetha?s characters don?t let us know immediately as to what they are feeling and which side of this divide they are on. In Delovak Athara she is, in several sequences, infuriated with Nissanka when Nissanka is calm and (inexplicably) cheerful when he is for obvious reasons frightened.
This refreshingly contradictory quality of hers is what adorns almost every performance, no matter how good or bad her films seem today. I think the reason for that is that she wasn?t prolific the way that Malini or even Swarna was: she chose her scripts meticulously. A prolific player tends to accept roles that pigeon-hole him or her; a more selective player tends to go for roles that he or she is comfortable with. Swineetha is, I believe, a living embodiment of this strange paradox.??
And in the end that?s why she?s able to symbolise both submission and rebellion. In Welikathara she literally cradles her husband, comparing him to their soon-to-be-born baby. A couple or so sequences later, however, she has begun to feel so betrayed by his attitude of appeasement towards Goring Mudalali that she contorts her earlier feelings to spurn his very manhood.
It?s a call for defiance, a statement almost, but he gets it, the same way Nissanka gets it by facing his conscience and Vijaya Kumaratunga, Bandula Galagedara, and Joe Abeywickrema get it by discerning their inadequacies: with the realisation that beneath her sense of simplicity are strong undercurrents of individuality and agency. That?s where she triumphs: you never actually get her, because she prefers to reveal her characters, not in gushes and torrents, but in a more nuanced, less explicit way.??

Tribute to Wilbert Gunasekara Your memories will linger in our hearts always
	
My dearest Daddy, I remember you once asked my daughter, whether you could manage four more years and live up to be 100 years old? November 20, 2017 is the day you dreamt of. But sadly, you could not make it.? ?
You smiled with each word you said just to hide the physical pain because you cared not to leave worries on others? shoulders, what a brave gentleman you were. In the last few years of your life, you reminisced how you had come that far.? ?
Though your absence is greatly felt, you left millions of memories and live perfectly within our hearts forever. I spent one evening with my daughters to reel backward and pick a few memories from far to near and it only made us miss you dearly again. You maintained an open-mind and accepted all the good from Eastern and Western cultures that assisted your way of life.? ?
The most important thing you had done was giving the chance for me and my brothers to see this world and share a life with you. I feel like people do not appreciate enough the love and care they get from a person before it?s too late. Is it a normal human nature that people are too busy to know what are the important things that should be cared for foremost? However, I find peace knowing I cared for you as much as I could specially in your elderly days. Please forgive me if I didn?t do enough.??
When I was a little girl, you treated me like a princess for being the only daughter and the eldest child. Once you bought me a dress (the best of all) for a party, I still have a picture of it in my mind even at the age of 72 years!? ?
Life is never easy for anyone and the family life is even harder; yet Daddy, you managed it incredibly well spending a good long wedded life of nearly 70 years with Mum. You and Mum were both blessed to live together that far in time even through the ups-and-downs that a marriage could easily bring. You loved your wife, Wimala and your six children very much. As you always appreciated, Mummy came the foremost running your family but you were the rock behind her guiding all of us. I admired your quality being a brilliant human being.?
Daddy, you really planned to celebrate your 70th wedding anniversary in June 2014. You needed the world to know a marriage can last long if the two people in it could work together. I was so glad to capture the moment of 69 years of your marriage in a picture. I also liked the photo we took on the same day to celebrate the 4 generations of women together: Mummy, myself, Chuty and daughter Natasha.
After your death and the subsequent alms giving, everyone returned to their homes leaving behind the silence, loneliness and sadness that filled in our hearts. There was one note hugely thanking a doctor who saved you from pain/danger by performing a critical surgery and letting you live some more years. That was just an example of how you showed your gratitude to people.?
You always talked about your happy younger days at Ovakanda, Rathgama, being the eldest son of Liyanora Abeysekara and Oranelis Mendis Gunasekara and about your three younger brothers. You lived in different cities in Sri Lanka due to your duty constraints. My brothers and I really enjoyed travelling with you for the holidays to Anuradhapura. Memories of you will only bring me smiles and tears of joy. The genes you gave us and the lessons you taught will keep me stronger everyday.
Daddy, I have now lost my dearest Mum last year, as her mental status became poorer towards the end. She had little understanding of where you were gone, so she kept asking me where you were. When I couldn?t tell her, she sobbed helplessly. Also, to our greatest shock, my dearest brother Upali passed away on June 18, 2017. He lost his battle with cancer for 4 years at the age of 63. Upali?s loss has greatly affected us all. He was such a brave man just like you and even to his last moment, he was conscious and held his spirit high.
I still cannot believe the three of you were gone for good. But, I find peace again knowing how the three of you had great faith in Buddha, Dhamma, Sangha and Karma until your last moments. I hope you, Mum and Upali would meet each other again somewhere. Finally, I hope we all meet again some day when we reach the ultimate Nirvana as one big family. May the Gauthama Buddha?s mercy reach upon us all.? ?
Your legacy of knowledge, humour, honesty and courage will live to the future through the generations of your children. I believe you enjoyed a life far more than ninety-six years. Daddy, I wish you a very happy 100th birthday! and will always love you!? ?
People and memories? ?
Tears and smiles? ?
Days and years? ?
Always gone by? ?
You make your destination? ?
Your own unique way? ?
Conquer any hardship? ?
To find your rewards.? ?
Be a winner in life!? ?
Just like my Daddy was

UNP back-benchers tell Musthapha to resign
	
UNP back bench parliamentarians today challenged Provincial Councils Minister Faizer Musthapha to resign from his portfolio before the gazette on delimitation was proved incorrect.
UNP MP Kavinda Jayawardhane told a news conference held at the parliament complex that the minister should resign and sit at the back row as an ordinary MP.
He said the UNP was ready to join any force to win the elections as claimed by JVP leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake.
Mr. Jayawardhane said it was the SLFP and the joint opposition who wanted to postpone the elections.
He said the SLFP leaders and Gotabaya Rajapaksa, Namal Rajapaksa, Dilan Perera and Nimal Siripala De Silva were doing a deal to join the SLFP, UPFA and the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) and that it was they who were delaying the election till the deal was done.
"That is their dream. We cannot wait till they join the opposition. The President has powers to hold the elections. UNP was not in control of the local bodies for the past 20 years. We are waiting to show our powers. It is unreasonable to taint our hopes," he said. (Ajith Siriwardana)

US renews grant for clearing bombs in Cambodia
	
REUTERS, 22nd NOVEMBER, 2017- The United States on Wednesday opened a $2 million tender to help clear unexploded bombs in Cambodia weeks after the government?s mine clearance agency said its U.S. funding had been stopped.
Relations between Cambodia and the United States have spiraled downwards this year with the government accusing Americans of involvement in a plan by detained opposition leader Kem Sokha to bring down Prime Minister Hun Sen.
Washington has rejected the accusations as baseless.
Last week, it said it was cutting aid for next year?s election and would take further steps after the opposition Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP) was dissolved by the Supreme Court at the government?s request. The U.S. embassy said it was accepting applications for a $2 million one-year grant to survey and clear unexploded ordnance in eastern Cambodia, which suffered heavy U.S. bombing during the war in neighboring Vietnam.

Will sort out legal issues on Dec 4 - SLFP and UPFA
	
While vowing that the SLFP would never let any party or group to postpone the LG polls, UPFA General Secretary Mahinda Amaraweera said the SLFP would sorted out the legal issues on December 4 at the Court of Appeal.
Minister Amaraweera said he as the General Secretary of the UPFA and Duminda Dissanayaka as the SLFP General Secretary through their team of lawyers would submit written and oral arguments on December 4 before the Court of Appeal as to why the local government polls should not be postponed.
Addressing the weekly SLFP news briefing at the party office today Minister Amaraweera said it was the SLFP that maintained a clear and firm policy on local government polls saying that it must be held under the new electoral system that will do away with the much criticized PR system and create a direct representation of the people at every ward.
Minister Amaraweera pointed out that the new electoral system was not 100% perfect and there may be loopholes or mistakes in the system. But we must hold polls as early as possible. We will be in a position after the polls, what and where the amendments or corrections are needed and can rectify them with further amendments.
?The main reason that delayed the conducting of the local government polls is the delimitation process that required demarcating boundaries of local government bodies and wards under the new Local Government Electoral (Amendment) Act No. 22 of 2015. The blunders, mistakes, omissions and commissions of the report of the delimitation commission appointed under the previous regime had to be corrected on the request of all political parties. That is why the local government polls were delayed,? he added.
Minister Amaraweera said the SLFP Central Committee met on Wednesday night led by party leader, President Maithripala Sirisena and took a few important decisions.
The SLFP is firm that the local government polls would not be postponed and therefore organization of the party from the grassroot level to the top for the elections would be carried out regardless of the Court Order that suspended preparation until December 4. The SLFP has already argued before the Court of Apeal as to why polls should not be postponed.
Minister Amaraweera pointed out that some political parties and groups wanted to postpone the local government polls while some others wanted to hold the polls under the old system. The SLFP rejects both suggestions and wants to conduct polls as early as possible under the new electoral system that gives every local government ward a member voted into by the people. The new system will prevent drug dealers and underworld characters from winning local government polls using thuggery and money power and added the SLFP was for clean and fair polls and politics forever (Sandun A Jayasekera and Chaturanga Pradeep)
