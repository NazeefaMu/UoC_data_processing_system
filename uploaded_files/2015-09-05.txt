Indian fishermen launch strike against Sri Lankan Navy
	
Mechanised boat fishermen in the island have decided to abstain from fishing from Saturday, protesting the arrest and attack of fishermen and confiscation of their boats by the Sri Lankan Navy.
Three days after the Sri Lankan Navy arrested 16 fishermen, including four from Thangachimadam in the island, leaders of 11 fishermen associations met here on Friday and decided to launch an indefinite strike from Saturday, a fishermen leader said.
The fishermen, who enjoyed the right to fish in the Palk Bay for several centuries, could no longer do so as the Sri Lankan Navy attacked them and destroyed their nets, he said. After arresting the fishermen with their boats on charges of poaching, the Sri Lankan authorities refused to return the boats while releasing the fishermen after days of incarceration.
The fishermen had lost 18 of 84 boats confiscated by the Sri Lankan Navy during the last fishing season. Those boats could not be salvaged as they were badly damaged due to months of neglect in Sri Lankan ports and the boat owners were yet to get any compensation.
After the new fishing season began in June, the Sri Lankan Navy had confiscated about 30 boats and they remained anchored on Sri Lankan shores, he said. The boat owners feared that the boats could not be salvaged as they were exposed to the vagaries of weather and faced the danger of getting damaged.
Chief Minister Jayalalithaa has written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi several times, seeking intervention for securing the release of the fishermen and the boats, but the Centre maintained a stoic silence, he said.(The Hindu)

Lankan with fake visa deported from Taiwan
	
A Sri Lankan national transiting at Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport on his way to Germany on a forged Schengen Area visa was picked up by the National Immigration Agency?s (NIA) special cross-unit task force yesterday and deported to Sri Lanka.
According to the agency, the man had arrived in Taiwan on a China Airlines flight from Singapore bound for Frankfurt, Germany, purportedly on a business trip.
The NIA task force noticed a discrepancy in his Schengen Area visa, the agency said. After detaining him and checking the visa with the Borders Affairs Corps, the visa was determined to be fake, the agency said.
When questioned, the man said he sought to make a new future for himself in Frankfurt, Germany, due to the instability in Sri Lanka in the wake of its civil war.
Sri Lanka concluded a 26-year-long civil war against rebel group the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam in May 2009.
The man admitted to contacting human trafficking syndicates for his travel documents, adding that he had picked up his boarding pass to Germany after the syndicate arranged for his transport to Singapore, the agency said. The man said he had assumed that his passage through Taiwan during the summer season would be overlooked due to the high number of travelers passing through, the agency said.
After consulting the Taoyuan District Prosecutors? Office, the Border Affairs Corps was authorized to deport the Sri Lankan, it said.(Taipei Times)

TNA to talk to govt. on national question
	
The main opposition Tamil National Alliance (TNA) said yesterday it hoped to hold talks with the government on resolving the national question no sooner Prime Minster Ranil Wickremesinghe returns from his upcoming visit to India, party officials said yesterday.

TNA Spokesman M.A. Sumanthiran told Daily Mirror that one of the stated objectives of the national unity government was the resolution of the national question.

?We will talk to the government straightaway with a view to resolving the long outstanding matter,? he said and added that the Tamil people were happy with the appointment of TNA leader R. Sampanthan as the Opposition Leader of Parliament.

According to reports several religious ceremonies have been organised at Hindu kovils in the North and East to invoke blessings on Mr. Sampanthan while a reception has been organised in Trincomalee to welcome the new opposition leader.

The TNA has also decided that in the absence of Mr. Sampanthan, Jaffna district MP Mavai Senathirajah, will act as the opposition leader.
