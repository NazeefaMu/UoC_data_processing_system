A Rajapaksa politically victimizing me: Sajin
	
While claiming that he was not willing to be a state witness in any court case, former UPFA MP Sajin de Vass Gunawardena said today that one of the Rajapaksas was attempting to politically victimize him.
Addressing a media conference held in Colombo, he said he would soon disclose the details and reliable evidence against this particular Rajapaksa whom he described as the invisible hand spewing out many baseless allegations against him.
He said every politician had started pointing fingers at him without any proof for temporary political advantages. Wimal Weerawansa, Udaya Gammanpila and Sri Ranga Jeyaratnam (J. Sri Ranga) are some of the politicians who level various allegations against him in the media, he said.
Recently, J. Sri Ranga has told a television programme that it was me who handled the technical dealings in SriLankan Airlines. I have not worked at SriLankan and I have no connection with it. Sri Rangas allegations are fabricated stories. Meanwhile, I called the CID over an article published in a leading Sinhala paper that the CID had informed the Court regarding some foreign bank accounts belong to me. I was informed by the CID that such incident has not taken place in the Court. I should emphasize that it is the responsibility of the media to double- check and verify the facts before they are published, he said.
Commenting on the ongoing investigations against him at the Criminal Investigations Department (CID), Financial Crimes Investigations Division (FCID) and the Bribery Commission, Mr. Gunawardena said all of them are probing on his assets which have been earned by him according to a formal procedure.
I earned my properties in a transparent manner. I have not stolen anything from anyone. All my assets have been accounted properly.
He said that the investigations have been initiated based on the complaints lodged by his political opponents.
He said the particular Rajapaksa was administrating more than 12 web sites which were used to sling mud at him.
I will not stop my political career despite such baseless allegations. I will continue my politics with the SLFP. I have not made any deals with anyone. I performed my duties according to the principles of my party. I have not gone beyond that. A very wrong misinterpretation has been given about me to the people. I am not afraid of any one because I know that I am innocent, he said.
When asked by a journalist about his stance on the joint opposition, he said it was just an imagery of some politicians and that had no political basis. He also said that he did not intend to join them who had caused the division within the SLFP.
Speaking about the incident in 2014 involving him and Sri Lankas former High Commissioner Chris Nonis, Mr. Gunawardena claimed that he did not assault Mr. Nonis and only an argument took place between them. He said the minute incident had been blown up by this Rajapaksa for political purposes.
We did not fight. There were plenty of people around us when the incident happened. It was just an argument that was caused when I was defending our former media secretary over some issue. I intend to disclose everything about that incident in detail very soon. I anyway apologized to Mr. Nonis the following morning. This personal matter should not be considered a national problem, he said. (Piyumi Fonseka)

CSE announces change in price multiples calculation methodology
	
The Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) yesterday announced a revision in the methodology of calculating price multiples (P/E, P/BV and DY).
The price-earnings ratio (P/E ratio) and dividend yield ratio (DY) will be calculated taking into consideration rolling four quarterly earnings instead of the current practice of sourcing earnings from the annual results of respective listed companies.
The price to book value ratio (P/BV) will now be calculated based on the latest quarterly results instead of the annual results of the listed companies. The change was implemented with effect from May 3, 2016. 
Reporting the dates in terms of year-end may vary based on the company and could therefore mean that the ratios such as P/E, P/BV and DY that are based on the annual data have the potential to be out-of-date. 
Commenting on the development, CSE Head of Research and New Products Nishantha Hewavithana stated, The revised method would help to portray the current earnings trend in a timely and effective manner by taking into consideration the latest available financials of the company. With this revision, the multiples will offer a realistic reflection to users of this information, which would facilitate better decision-making. 
The use of quarterly statistics is a globally accepted methodology that is practiced by the exchanges around the world and puts all listed companies on a comparable footing, which facilitates a fair and timely comparison.

The Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) and CFA Society Sri Lanka (CFASL) jointly held a special market opening ceremony yesterday in support of the Putting Investors First Month campaign, to call attention to the needs and rights of investors.
The Putting Investors First Month is a month-long global initiative focused on promoting the needs and rights of investors.
A central focus of the campaign is the Statement of Investor Rights, which investment management professionals are encouraged to share with their clients and communities. The list applies to financial products and services such as investment management, research and advice, personal banking, even insurance and real estate and is intended to help investors demand that financial professionals abide by these rights. The document includes rights that investors are entitled to expect such as objective advice, disclosure of conflicts of interest and fair and reasonable fees.
Commenting on the initiative, CSE Chairman Vajira Kulatilaka stated, We are pleased to unite with financial professionals and exchanges around the world to protect our investors and their interests. As the Chairman of the CSE, I would like to pledge our continued commitment to putting investor interests above all others  as is the objective of this important campaign. We will continue to play a critical role in advancing the interests of investors around the country, especially through our investor education and advocacy efforts.
He added, In the midst of the various growth initiatives we are pursuing at the CSE, what remains unchanged is our focus on maintaining our markets integrity and quality, which is in the best interest of our investors. We are fully aware that only operating an open, secure, fair, orderly and transparent marketplace will truly protect the rights and needs of our investors. I am also glad to see the bell ringing ceremony initiative extending its scope, to serve as a platform which also brings attention to issues and causes that are important to society.
The CFASL is hosting a number of events supporting the campaign, including a retail investor seminar with local speakers and webinars to mark Sri Lankas participation in this global initiative. Throughout the month of May, many of CFAs 147 member societies worldwide will host local events as part of the campaign. In addition, the organisation will spotlight A Difference That Matters, a global advertising campaign, which features CFA charterholders from around
the world and aims to build a better investment management profession by raising investors awareness of what makes CFA charterholders different.
Putting Investors First Month is an exciting global initiative of which we are proud to be a part, said CFASL Advocacy Chair Murtaza Jafferjee.
We hope to raise awareness of the need for firms and investment management professionals to protect the interests of investors above all else. We want our members to support and participate in the effort using the #CFAdifference hashtag and to share the Statement of Investor Rights with their clients, colleagues and firms. The end goal for us is to build a stronger, more trustworthy investment management profession.

Decision over MR's security won't be reversed: Ruwan
	

State Minister of Defence Ruwan Wijewardene said the governments decision to withdraw the army from the former President Mahinda Rajapaksas security division and deploy only the police would not be changed under any circumstance.

The minister pointed out that the army was responsible for the security of the country and that the police were able to provide adequate protection to the VIPs who could obtain the services of the STF if required.
He said 50 out of 105 army officials in the former Presidents security division had already been replaced with 50 police officers and the rest will also be replaced , but it was not a political victimization as alleged by the joint opposition. He expressed concern over the joint oppositions attempt to mislead the people. The minister pointed out that Prime Minister sated in parliament that he was prepared to deploy the number of police STF officials required by the former president. He said it was a question as to why the joint opposition undermined the police and the civil defence department.

Ltd Managing Director R. Muralidaran

March 15, 2016 saw the wrapping up of the Sri Lanka Investment Summit in Singapore on a high note. Attended by 100s of professionals from various corporations in the financial industry, the summit hosted a number of prestigious speakers, including high-profile members of the Sri Lankan government and notable personalities of the finance and commercial world.
Investor confidence received a huge boost at this summit, increasing Sri Lankas chances of positioning itself as one of the fastest growing economies in Asia.
This was aptly demonstrated in the month following the summit, where the country experienced a complete turnaround with a net inflow of Rs.15 billion, stemming what was a steady decline with outflow of nearly Rs.270 billion in the 12 months preceding the summit. Sri Lanka is the next best thing just about to happen and when it takes off, Sri Lanka will not need to have marketing or promotions of any sort as it will take off faster than a rocket. But until that moment, the pearl of the Indian Ocean needs to earn and build up a level of trust with the investor. We believe, in Sri Lanka, its a matter of time before everyone else does, stated Perpetual Treasuries Limited CEO/Head of Group Treasury Kasun Palisena.
Perpetual Treasuries has made it its mission to connect both local and international investors with opportunities in Sri Lankas debt and equity markets and to support the growth and development of Sri Lankas capital markets through the provision of specialized investment services.
Driving this, it was one of the prime sponsors of this recently concluded investment summit in Singapore.

Yoshitha's application to travel abroad declined by Courts
	
Yoshitha Rajapakses application for permission to travel abroad accompanying his father former President Mahinda Rajapakse to participate at celebrations relating to the assumption of duties of Ugandian President, was declined by Kaduwela Courts today. The Courts also directed the declined application to be forwarded to the Colombo High Court.
Yoshitha Rajapakse who is charged against fraudulent transactions of the Carlton Sports Network under the Money Laundering act, along with four other directors, are presently enlarged on bail under conditions that had been imposed with a ban on foreign travel.
When the above application was submitted to Courts through a motion, yesterday, the FCID appearing in Courts stated that statements of bank accounts of all the suspects are now under investigations and the connected investigations into other accounts and transactions relating to other complaints have not been concluded, and objected to the grant of permission for the suspect to travel abroad.
Attorney PC Jayantha Weerasinghe who represented Yoshitha and others informed Courts that an invitation had been received by the former President Mahinda Rajapakse to attend the celebration in Uganda on the assumption into power of the Ugandian President, and with the hope of including Yoshitha Rajapakse to accompany his father, this application had been made.
Considering the submissions, Judge Dhammika Hemapala informed that the suspects had been enlarged on bail by the Colombo High Courts, and that therefore this Court cannot grant permission to go abroad, and ordered that this request be forwarded to the Colombo High Courts.
