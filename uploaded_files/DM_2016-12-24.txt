Christmas brings a Prophecy of Peace
	
When Jesus Christ was born in Bethlehem of Judea the first Christmas night, the angelic voices that rang out from its distant hills echoed Glory to God in the highest and on earth peace to people of goodwill.
This peace song has ever since been heard a million times over, every time Christmas comes at the years end. The whole world is aglow with Christmas cheer and goodwill during this festive season and rightly so since we are dealing with the Christian truth of God becoming man as an extraordinary sign of Gods love for mankind. We are told in the Bible that God so loved the world that He sent his only Son to save the world since He is a God of concern. Jesus Christ himself having loved his own, he had loved them the end, as the New Testament testifies. When the conscience of man resonates with the will of God, peace is its evident result. When this obedience or submission is disrupted, peace is disturbed with mankind and its world thrown into confusion. 
Christmas is the festival of peace. It brings together the singing angels and the shepherds who kept their flocks by night even as the wise men from the East moved towards the place of Christs birth to the inn guided by a star. The appearance of the peace-child was good news to both the shepherds and the wise men. They both responded with joy hastening to the city of Bethlehem, the royal city. The song of the angels and the light of the star proved to be guidance for those who came searching for the child. Thus unexpectedly, the shepherds and the wise men form part and parcel of the Christmas story and bring their specific roles to play in enhancing the joy that is inherent to Christmas. 
Christmas heralds an important message, a radical one at that, the world needs to hear today as it is engulfed daily in the shadows of fear, anxiety and doubt. Peace is possible in an atmosphere of order and tranquility. Wars, conflicts and divisions strain peace, which is the mother of prosperity and growth. Christmas does not refer to a secular type of peace where guns are silent and political ideologies are not at loggerheads and where there is no threat of war. True peace is the consort of well-being that is personal and social. It is when relationships are at their best with the diffusion of goodwill and mutual trust. The cry goes out today: If you are brothers, drop your arms. Let not the drums of war ever be heard that severely threaten harmony and peaceful living among nations, races, peoples and cultures. The common denominator of humanity must cement all interactive processes of social relations. 
Christmas brings a prophecy of peace. It announces its possibility and eventual realization dependent on all adverse conditions impeding it being avoided with tact and prudence. Only wise men can achieve and enjoy the blessings of peace. The foolish will always risk putting it in jeopardy. Those who act rashly and are wanting in responsibility always endanger the roads and pathways to peace. History proves why peace is a very sensitive social issue and why it has to be won with the utmost care and concern. Prophecies need time for fulfillment and realization. It will keep the fires of hope and expectations ever burning in the minds and hearts of men who keep longing and thirsting for it. Peace can never co-exist with violence, ill-will and hatred. Love must conquer all. Compassion and empathy will win the day, if these are allowed to wield their power in all patience and good-will. Dispositions of kindness and openness to the other are absolute conditions for fostering the spirit of peace. Peace can also not exist in a milieu of economic adversity and poverty that deny the basic human needs: food, clothing and shelter. 
Christmas is no mere feast of a birth of a child. Its impact is seen when thought out in terms of the message of the one who was born. A child has been given to us: his name is wonderful counsellor and prince of peace. Jesus of Nazareth therefore brings a message of peace and invites all to relish the blessings of peace. Christmas also takes us back to his wonderful soul-stirring words declared at the sermon of the Mount: it is the great charter of the Kingdom that he brought to us. In this new world, the rich will share with the poor, fewer people will agonize over injustices and hurts. Men and women will keep their conscience clear of sin and discord and will be blessed with purity of heart. The sick, blind, lame and deaf will bear in their hearts hopes of recovery, good health and healing. 
Life will be imparted to all for the Lord of Christmas will bestow life in its fullness: in all its dimensions, physical, emotional and social. He will reach out to all including social outcasts, children, women and those subject to diseases. He will make no distinction between sinner and saint, Jew and Greek, those circumcised and those who are not. This was the social revolution that swept over all the cosmopolitan centres of ancient middle-east: Corinth, Colossae, Ephesus, Philippi, Galatia, Thessalonika and in the later epoch overtaking even imperial Rome. The walls came down and the roads began leading to Rome, the eternal city.
There will be in his Kingdom no discrimination based on language, race, social status and even gender: for all will be children of God redeemed in the blood he will shed at his death. The price of their salvation is no precious silver or gold but the gift of his own life offered in ransom for all sinners. What a wonderful story is this prophecy of Christmas!  The Prince of peace, the Christ-child of Bethlehem hence became a child of promise and an incredible source of blessing for all nations. That is why when he was presented at the temple, another prophecy was uttered by another wise man: This child is set for the rise and fall of many, for mine eyes have seen the salvation of God!. The appearance of Jesus Christ in the humble abode of Bethlehem and later on in the village of Nazareth where he grew up in age, wisdom and grace could be none other than a veritable prophecy of peace and prosperity for mankind.

Christmas in an orphanage
	

There was much activity and excitement in the Childrens Home. The kind of thrilling excitement and atmosphere that pervades it perhaps a couple or so times during the year at Christmas, Vesak and the Sinhala and Hindu New Year. 

Christmas being essentially a childrens festival connected with the birth of the Christ Child, the connection with St Nicholas or Santa Claus bringing gifts for children is naturally appealing. The shops and pavements overflowing with toys, varieties of sweets, colourful trinkets and balloons, decorations and tinsel and baubles in eye-catching colours evoke an answering sparkle in the eyes of children. Children of all ages and sizes ranging from two-year-olds to fidgety twelve-year-olds frisked around blowing balloons, blowing bubbles, colliding with one another in joyous camaraderie; sharing gifts and other goodies that came their way in this annual splurge of people sharing their bounty with the less privileged. Screams of laughter and jollity reverberated in the merry atmosphere of the season; jaws moved sucking sweets munching biscuits and chocolates and chewing gum. It was heaven on earth for these orphaned children; orphaned for various reasons and finding companionship in their common predicament.
Some forsaken by their unwed mothers. War orphans and innocent victims caught in the crossfire that ensued in the border villages in war time. Children given over for domestic work for parents to maintain themselves, grossly abused by their masters and mistresses and sent to the Home on court order. Children from broken homes having experienced the trauma of domestic violence. Alone in an infinitely unfriendly, pitiless world but for this haven. The caretakers looked on, sharing in the joy of their protgs on this eve of Christmas. They were all well into the mood of Christmas. In a corner stood a giant Christmas Tree, glittering in all its splendour, the magnanimity of yet another affluent donor. 
In the midst of all this jollity, a little girl of four or five years of age, a recent addition, sat apart. A rejected Teddy was at her side. She rejected offers of friendliness, scared by the noise around her and engrossed in a world of her own. Some of the children lit sparklers. Suddenly there was a powerful burst of crackers and there was a convulsive burst of hysterical screams from the little child. She screamed, running around in circles in sheer fright. She ran screaming into the night pursued by the girls who looked after the children. Having caught up with her, they coaxed her to enter the adjoining church to distract her. The now sporadic crackers brought on a convulsive shiver. Perhaps it was the effect of some traumatic incident she had experienced
in her life.
They took her to the crib prepared for the nights celebration, pointing out Mother Mary and the other figures. Something clicked. This seemed somehow familiar to her. The semblance of a hut, cattle and a man and woman protectingtheir child.
They were life-sized. Slipping down from the arms of the girl who carried her, she crept into the crib. She who had rejected the large teddy bear clutched the baby Jesus tight and huddled in the hay close beside Mary, her eyes closing due to the sheer exhaustion of her trauma, as though she had found the familiar surroundings she had been searching for since whatever traumatic experience she had faced in the village. This was home.

Christmas should be celebrated without waste: Catholic Bishops' Conference
	
The Christmas should be celebrated by avoiding the wastage of food, cutting down trees and electricity usage for exaggerated decorations, the Catholic Bishops' Conference of Sri Lanka said yesterday in its Christmas message.
Catholic Bishops Conference said the people had a duty to be more sensitive to the human needs and sufferings prevailing in our society while engage in various forms of charitable activities during Christmas.
As we meditate on the value of life during Christmas we are called to condemn all that is detrimental to the promotion of life such as abortion and other forms of killing and destruction, it said.
It said the Christmas reminded us of the need to invite Jesus into our lives and it seemingly simple birth in a stable in Bethlehem is a universal call towards conversion.
It also said the Jesus had invited all of us to experience this fullness of life he had offered and added that hence the Christmas celebrations could not be a mere recalling of a past event.
It is an occasion to understand more deeply, the real value of life and to witness to this fullness in the society we live. Let us commit ourselves to changing all that is not in keeping with Gods holy will in our midst by becoming agents of peace, harmony and reconciliation, it said.
It also said the people should offer their gratitude to God for the beautiful gift of Jesus and should pray that all of us would be renewed by the Spirit to be living witnesses of the Lord Jesus.
We wish all our Faithful, our fellow citizens and all men and women of goodwill a Blessed Christmas! it said.

Jesus Christ was a great messenger of reconciliation: President
	
Religion makes people show compassion, kindness and empathy towards others and it is one of the most precious guiding lights of the human civilization, President Maithripala Sirisena said in his Christmas message.
The President said Jesus Christ was a great messenger of reconciliation to the world and it made him an eternal savior to people around the world.
Jesus Christ, who could reduce power-crazy kings such as Herod to a mere mention in the history was a great messenger of reconciliation and social righteousness to the world, he said.
He said the Christmas, which was celebrated by all the Christians around the world as a universal festival, embodies loving kindness.
Over 2,000 years ago, Jesus Christ was born into this world in an era when immorality, chaos and cruelty were the order of the day, he said.
He said since then the new religious vision that emerged centering a humble dwelling shines eternally as a mark of human greatness.
I extend my warmest greetings for a wonderful Christmas to all Christians who nourish the teachings of universal love, peace, happiness and kindness. I wish for a Happy Christmas full of Peace and Joy to all Christians, he said.

Reflections for Christmas
	

Young and old alike, all of us have experienced or learned about momentous happenings that shook our world. Some events are painful to remember: the Nazi campaign of destruction, presidential assassinations, terrorist attacks. Others are joyous news: a war is finally ended, our nations independence is protected, a dreaded disease has been eradicated. 

One event, however, rises above them all: the birth of Jesus Christ, the Messiah, Son of God, Prince of Peace, righteous ruler of heaven and earth. His humble advent on earth was for one purpose and only one: to sacrifice His life for the sins of the world- my sin, and yours. 
No wonder the sky lit up with jubilation and praise! No wonder a unique celestial body hovered in awesome recognition! No wonder kings of the known world travelled months to see this Kings of kings! No wonder lowly shepherds heralded the news to anyone who would listen! Good news of great joy that will be for all the people. No wonder we celebrate... our Saviour is born! 
The people who walked in darkness have seen a great light. A light has dawned upon those who lived in the land as dark as death. The light that has come down from heaven has conquered the darkness caused by sin. Jesus is born. God became flesh. Our salvation is near. God gives us His only Son as an ultimate proof of His love for us. Jesus is born in Bethlehem. Bethlehem literally means home of bread. This is very significant because God became flesh to be our food and drink. He has categorically told us, If you do not eat the flesh of the Son of man and drink his blood, you have no life in you. Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will raise him up on the last day. When Satan asks Jesus to order the stones to turn into bread, Jesus tells him that man cannot live on bread alone but on every word that God speaks. Jesus knew for sure that he did not come to satisfy his hunger and thirst but he that he came to satisfy our hunger and quench our thirst. He would accomplish this by offering himselfon the cross. 


Today more than ever, Jesus needs to be born in our life and in our world. Our world is darkened by human selfishness, pride and sin. We need Jesus to reconcile us with God and one another. We need a Bethlehem experience in our life. The joy of Christmas is not for a day or a season. It is an eternal joy, a joy that no one can take from us because it is the joy of Jesus Christ himself made present in our hearts through the Holy Spirit who dwells within us (Rom 5:2-5). The first to hear the good news of Jesus birth were not the rich, the influential, the powerful or the religious and political leaders of Israel but the ordinary, insignificant and poor in society. Jesus came to empower the powerless, to seek and save the lost, to heal the sick, to raise the dead, to show us the Fathers unconditional love. May Jesus be born in our hearts and lives this Christmas. 
By taking on our humanity, Jesus has shown us that we can be divine. He has shown us how far we can go even in our humanity. We can love more, dare more, believe more and be more. Nothing is now outside the scope of our humanity, which after the birth of Jesus is no longer a limitation but always an advantage. This is why according to the letter to the Hebrews, God who spoke of old only through prophets, messengers or messages, has finally and definitively spoken in and through a Son. This is also why the oracle of Isaiah composed towards the end of the exile and which announces the return of the exiles to Jerusalem find its fulfillment. Captivity and limitation have come to an end. 
Thus, Christmas is not merely the celebration of a historical birth or a birth that took place over two thousand years ago. It is about becoming conscious of who we really are as human beings. It is the celebration of life in all its fullness. It is the celebration of the transformation of limit to limitlessness, of selfishness to selflessness, of bondage and fear to freedom and unconditional love. 

The best recipe that should be taken from the Christmas stable to the Christmas table, is the recipe of joy, which will come when the inns of our lives are opened to welcome the divine infant in swaddling clothes, lying in mangers all over the world. 
Christmas will always be a three dimensional festival, denoting the birth of Christ, the unity of God and man and the promise of salvation and eternal life. Christianity therefore inspires hope and confidence of a new life in Christ.

## Title: Sinhala Cinemas Line of Destiny Re-drawn By Rekava 60 Years Ago
## Section: DBS Jeyaraj Column

Sinhala Cinemas Line of Destiny Re-drawn By Rekava 60 Years Ago
	
By D.B.S. Jeyaraj
December 28, 1956 remains a red letter day in the cinematic history of Sri Lanka (formerly Ceylon). The maiden feature film of 37-year-old director Lester James Peries premiered at the upmarket Regal theatre in Colombo on that day. It was a black and white Sinhala film named Rekava. Though Rekava is spelt in English with both a V as well as a W, I am sticking to V because the original title shown in the film spelled it that way.
The film was hailed as a turning point in the decade-long evolving history of Sinhala cinema that began with the screening of the first Sinhala film Kadawunu Poronduwa (Broken promise) on January 21, 1947. Veteran journalist Mervyn de Silva, writing about Rekava after the premiere, described it as the birth of Sinhala cinema.
The films Sinhala title Rekava was translated into English as the Line of Destiny when it was screened at the prestigious Festival De Cannes in 1957. It was most appropriate as Rekava was a landmark achievement that altered the destiny of Sinhala cinema.
This column intends focusing on the film to mark the 60th anniversary of Rekavas first screening on that fateful day. Most of the facts that I rely upon on this narrative are from the horses mouth itself via interviews given by Lester James Peries appearing in different books and journals. I, myself, have utilised these in some of my earlier writings and would now do the same for this article.
The renowned journalist, critic and writer Regi Siriwardena who was later associated with Lester in writing scripts for films like Gamperaliya, Delovak Athara and Golu Hadawatha was exhilarated after seeing it. He called it an event of tremendous importance in an excellent review written by him in the Sunday Observer. The following excerpt from that review sums up aptly the significance of the film -- And so, in the very first few moments of Rekava, you realise you are in an entirely different world from that of the Sinhalese film up to now. We are no longer watching preposterous puppets animated by synthetic emotions; this is life itself What Lester Peries has done is to tear down the artificial barriers that the Sinhalese film industry had erected between the screen and the real life of our own people.
Regi and Mervyn and many others who praised Rekava were impressed by the fact that the film dispensed with the melodramatic hallmarks prevalent in Sinhala movies since the pioneering Kadawuna Porunthuwa or Broken Promise made in 1947. The making of Sinhala films was heavily influenced by Hindi and Tamil films made in India which were derisively described as Masala movies or formula films. Rekava was, in that sense, a departure which contrasted sharply with the usual Sinhala films. Rekava belonged to the realist cinema category.
The actors and actresses in Rekava appeared on screen as real people whom one meets daily. They spoke simply and in a natural way, without stylised diction or expansive gestures. There were many shots where they did not speak at all with their expressions conveying emotions through the eloquence of silence. The greater part of the story was related not by words and songs alone but to a very great extent by a number of images and scenes with minimal dialogue.
Another remarkable aspect of Rekava was that it was shot entirely on location outside a studio. Until then, movies were mostly filmed in studios in India and Sri Lanka, in artificially-constructed sets. Also, a few of the filmy stories took place in a rural area. Lester changed all that by basing the films tale in a rural village. More importantly, he filmed the village-based story in real village surroundings with cameraman Willie Blake. Most outdoor scenes in Rekava were shot in natural light.

From Rekava (1956) to Amma Waruney (2006)
With the advent of Rekava in 1956, newcomer Lester James Peries made his mark. Subsequently, with other masterpieces like Gamperaliya (Village upheaval) and Nidhanaya (The treasure), Lester has become a national icon identified with the sphere of Sri Lankan cinema over the years. Lester James Peries is acknowledgedly the pioneer of authentic Sinhala cinema. It was he who created in every sense of the term an indigenous cinema in both substance and style. It was also he who first gained worldwide recognition for Sinhala cinema.
In a film-making career spanning more than five decades, Lester has made 20 feature films inclusive of Pinhamy in 1980. His final feature was Amma Waruney or an Elegy to a mother (released in 2006). Lester has also made eleven short films - most of them in documentary mode. The first of them was Soliloquy made in 1949 and the last Kandy Perahera filmed in 1973. The greatness of Lester James Peries however cannot be measured by the quantity of his output. It is the qualitative nature of his films that elevated him to commendable heights.
Lester James Peries was born on April 5, 1919 in Dehiwela to Catholic parents from an affluent westernised background. His parents wanted him to become a lawyer or doctor while his teachers wanted him to be a Catholic priest. Lester however wanted to study literature and began writing stories, poems and plays from his student days. He was also an incurable film buff. Lester dropped out of school at the age of seventeen and became a journalist. He worked at the Daily News and later at Times of Ceylon. Lester also reviewed books for Radio Ceylon. It was then that he began dabbling in drama by joining the theatre group Drama circle. It is said that the legendary Lionel Wendt realised Lesters creative potential and advised his parents to allow him to do whatever he wanted.
Lester went to London in 1947 to join his brother Ivan, a reputed painter. The brothers lived together for some years and apparently led a bohemian way of life. Lester wrote a column from Britain for the Times of Ceylon in Colombo, then edited by Frank Moraes (it was titled Letters on the Arts from England). While working as correspondent of Times of Ceylon, Lester also engaged himself in making short films and documentaries. Short film Soliloquy, made in 1949, won an award for artistic and technical merit from the Institute of Amateur and Research Filmmakers of Great Britain in 1951. He also produced another award winner Farewell to Childhood. It was based on a short story he had written when in Sri Lanka but on film he adapted it to English surroundings.
It was the eminent documentary filmmaker Ralph Keene who was instrumental in persuading Lester to return home. You should make films in your own country, about your own people, Ralph told him. Keene himself went to Colombo and invited Lester to join him. After spending several years in London working as a journalist for the Times, Lester returned home and began work at the Government film Unit (GFU) for one-fourth the salary he got in Britain. However, four years at GFU dampened his spirits as Lester felt rather stultified, presumably due to internal politics in office. Besides, the creative impulse in him wanted to make a fictional feature film. There was also this growing disdain for the melodramatic Sinhala films being churned out and the idealistic ambition of making a realistic Sinhala film.
It was at this juncture that destiny played a hand in the form of kinsman Christopher Peries, a successful businessman. Christopher made Lester an offer he could not refuse. Lester was told that a group of entrepreneurs and professionals wanted to form a company and produce a Sinhala feature film. Lester was requested to quit GFU and come on board where he would be given a free hand. Lester would produce and direct the film. The script was to be of his choice. He could select the cast and crew. The company would purchase state of the art equipment. It was also guaranteed that the company would produce at least two films.

Cinematographer Willie Blake and Editor Titus Thotawatte 
Lester James Peries mulled over it and decided to grasp the offer. This was the opportunity he was waiting for. Two of his colleagues also opted to quit GFU and team up with Lester. One was the cinematographer William (Willie) Blake, and the other Editor Titus de Silva who was later known as Titus Thotawatte. The trio embarked on the challenging venture fired by the vision of making an authentic and realistic Sinhala film.
The production company was duly formed and named Chitra Lanka. The Chairman was wealthy tycoon Sarath Wijesinghe (uncle of Upali Wijewardene). Besides Christopher Peries, the others on the Board of Directors were eminent Lawyers George Chitty QC, H.W. Jayawardene QC (the younger brother of J.R. Jayawardene), cartoonist Aubrey Collette and Douglas Fernando (an insurance entrepreneur). The only hitch was that the initial offer of making two films had been downsized to one. It was stipulated that the second would be made if the first was a success.
The company got down to work. Several potential stories and scripts were perused including a synopsis of the historical novel Rohini by Martin Wickremasinghe. Lester however resolved that his venture would have a contemporary theme set in a rural environment. Three film factors deeply influenced and motivated Lester in this yearning to make a realistic film amidst a rural setting.
Firstly there was the semi-fictional documentary Nelungama made by Lesters boss at the GFU Ralph Keene. Lester had co-written the script and the dialogues for it. While filming, Lester was exposed to village life and longed to make a film in a rural environment. Secondly was the impact of Italian neo-realistic cinema, particularly the films of Vittorio de Sica, Luchino Visconti and Roberto Rossellini. Thirdly was the film Do Bigha Zameen (Two acres of land) by Indian Director Bimal Roy that brought rural life to the screen in arealistic manner.
Interestingly, Lester was not influenced by his great Indian contemporary Satyajit Ray when he made Rekava. Actually Lester had not seen Rays pioneering Pather Panchali at the time he made Rekava. Indias greatest filmmaker Satyajit Ray had burst upon the global film scene before Lester James Peries. Rays Pather Panchali was made in 1955 and Aparajito in 1956. Since Lesters Rekava was released in late 1956, many reviewers wrongly assumed that Ray had inspired Peries. Satyajit Ray himself considered Lester to be of the same mould as him and once referred to the Sri Lankan director as his closest relative East of the Suez. In spite of the creative affinity between the two, Peries was not influenced by Ray when he made his first film.
Regi Siriwardena once told me in an interview that Lester had not seen Pathar Panchali or Aparajito when he first made Rekava. Regi, who has worked as scriptwriter with Peries on some films, told this writer that the first Ray film viewed by Lester was Aparajito and that too was only after Rekava was made. It is a classic instance of two great Asian directors being of the same creative wavelength and proceeding on a parallel course independent of each other, Siriwardena said.
After much pondering, Lester decided he himself must write the story and script for his first feature and not rely on an outside contributor. He wrote the story which was a simple narrative tinged with elements of a fairytale or fable. Lester wrote the script himself, aided by K.A.W. Perera who later became a successful director in his own right making films like Kapatikama, Lasanda and Bicycle Hora. There was however much improvisation as shooting went on with new lines and words of colloquial usage being introduced. Veteran actor D.R. Nanayakkara helped to add colloquial words in vogue.

Siriyala - Where Superstition Reigns Supreme
The story of Rekava takes place in a rural village (named in the movie as Siriyala), where superstition reigns supreme. The narrative in essence is about two childhood friends  a boy Sena and a girl Anula. A stilt-walker cum soothsayer reads Senas palm and predicts he would become a great healer. Later, Anula loses her sight by an accident and even the Vedamahathaya (native physician) finds it unable to cure her. Anula however believes Sena could cure her by touching her eyes. She regains her sight later and is convinced it was due to Senas healing powers.
The story of Senas healing spreads, and the boys father, together with a money lender, exploit this by promoting the sons powers in a bid to make money. When a wealthy landowners son is brought for healing, Sena is unable to cure him and the boy dies. The village begins to turn against Sena. The monsoon rains fail and a drought sets in causing hardship and misery. The suffering villagers start believing that Sena is possessed by a devil and is bringing bad luck to the village.
A thovil ceremony to exorcise the boy is held but the devil dancers fail to detect any evil spirits in the boy. The mass mood turns ugly and at one point, the landowner even tries to strangle and kill Sena. And then it begins to rain! As the torrential life-giving rain pours down, the evil hopeless mood of the people transforms into that of hope and happiness. Peace descends on Siriyala.
The cast for Rekava was handpicked by Lester. When Lester was living in Moratuwa, near the Lunawa lagoon, he had a black Morris Minor. There used to be a little boy from the neighbourhood who used to come and stare wide-eyed at the car. Lester then used to think that the boy with expressive eyes would look good in a film. So when Rekava began, it was that boy Somapala Dharmapriya who was picked to play Sena. Somapala had large, dark eyes filled with the wonder of childhood, observes Lester. The girl Anula was played by Myrtle Fernando. She had already acted in the Sinhala film Ahankara Sthriya. The boy was a fresher. The children were given their dialogues, and rehearsals were done for about two weeks in a classroom at Lesters Alma Mater St. Peters College, Bambalapitiya. However, the boy found it difficult to memorise the lines while rehearsing, but proved to be a natural actor in front of the camera. Lesters way of directing children was different. Instead of imposing anything, he would leave it to the kids themselves to act as they wished, intervening to correct only when absolutely necessary.
The role of the mother Kathrina was acted by Iranganie Serasinghe nee Meedeniya. Her husband in the film Kumetheris was played by her spouse in real life Winston Serasinghe. As is well-known, both Iranganie and Winston were from the elite English theatre, though they have acted in many Sinhala films. Sinhala stage actors of the time like D.R. Nanayakkara, N.R. Dias and Romulus de Silva played the parts of Sooty, Podi Mahathaya and the village headman respectively. The versatile Sesha Palihakkara acted as Miguel, the stilt-walker. The young couple Premawathie and Nimal was played by Mallika Pilapitiya and Ananda Weerakoon who did not act in films afterwards. Sadly, the kids playing Sena and Anula are no more as they both died of cancer sometime later.
In keeping with the assurances given to Lester, the company did let him purchase modern equipment. While in London, Lester had seen Carol Reed use the new Arriflex camera for location shooting in his film A kid for two farthings. So Lester procured the blimped, 400ft magazine Arriflex model from Germany. This was the first such camera to be used anywhere in Asia at that time. Lester also bought an RCA Kinevox magnetic sound recorder from the USA. This was the second of its kind to be used in Sri Lanka; the first was used by the GFU.

Shoot The Film Outdoors On Location
Lester wanted to skip studios and shoot the film outdoors on location. To be really authentic, he wanted to film it in an actual rural village. This yearning to some extent had a personal dimension. Lester was from a privileged Westernised background. He was a Roman Catholic brought up in an urban atmosphere. He was more at home speaking in English rather than in Sinhala. Lester knew very little of Sri Lankas villages and village life when he began making films. The decision to go to a village and shoot there was a manifestation of the deep-rooted desire to experience the village personally. While shooting the documentary Nelungama in Mirigama, Lester had begun to discover his roots and become appreciative of the islands cultural heritage - something his upper-middle class anglicised existence had restricted earlier. In later life, some critics pointed out that his distance from the social and cultural milieu in which his films were rooted was a disadvantage. But Lester compensated for this purported deficiency by infusing his creations with a tremendous amount of empathy. As Lester himself stated, In film, the visual language is more important than the verbal. A filmmaker must master the language and syntax of the film. What is most necessary for a filmmaker is empathy, the ability to empathise with his subject.
Thus began the shooting of Rekava on location. There were two locations for the film, one in the hill country at Bandarawela and the other in the low country at Wewala. Since this was Lesters first attempt in making a feature and because the concept of location shooting was something novel, the film-making became a trial and error exercise. The experience of making the path breaking film, its release and aftermath would be related in a forthcoming article.

## Title: The controversy surrounding the record-breaking Christmas tree

The controversy surrounding the record-breaking Christmas tree
	
Last year it was a bra this year it is a tree; Sri Lanka apparently likes to finish the year off with a controversial bang. This year, the proposed Worlds Tallest Christmas Tree at Galle Face has managed to stir up quite a debate, a result that seems to plague recent projects on this stretch of beach. 
The project started in August under the auspices of the Minister of Ports and Shipping Arjuna Ranatunga in an effort publicised as creating the Worlds Tallest Artificial Christmas Tree, a record which is currently held by GZ Think Big Culture Communication Co.,Ltd. (China), in Guangzhou, Guangdong, China for a tree of 180 feet. The cone-shaped skeleton is to be covered with a green mesh and inundated with an estimated one million pine cones. Its height; 320 feet. Keeping aside all the fame in 2004, Pope John Paul called the Christmas tree a symbol of Christ, exalting the value of life, and it reminds Christians of the tree of life of Genesis 2:9, an image of Christ, the supreme gift of God to humanity. 
The attempt however came under heavy fire, notably from the Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith, the Archbishop of Colombo who called it a wasteful expenditure. However after both the Prime Minister and the Minister of Finance met with the Cardinal to discuss the matter, the project seems to have got the festively appropriate green light. 
Irrespective of any blessings the project has received, the proposal has presented two issues. The general commercialisation of Christmas which has been an ongoing concern of a portion of society and the use of 12 million for a Christmas tree Guinness World Record. 
The Project Chairman Mangala Gunasekara said he was hoping to finish the tree by Christmas Eve (today). Rs.1.10 million has been used up of the total budget of 12 million. When asked about how the project was being funded, Gunasekara said most of the funding was via the various raw material itself, with Multilac sponsoring the paint and SR Metals sponsoring the metal needed. The wood we used was that which was being discarded so we were able to purchase it for an extremely cheap amount. This was the case with most of the material we had to pay for.
The pine cones for example were bought from an impoverished village in Nuwara Eliya, so we were able to help the community as well through this process. When quizzed about the donors of the funding, Gunasekara responded that the full list of donors would be read out when the tree was to be unveiled. Mobitel was going to give us Rs.4.5 million for this project but this didnt happen when the project was put on hold, so we had to go behind people begging for money. The raw material used for this however will not be used again once the tree is taken down after being up for the planned 13 days, Gunasekara added. 
With regards to the Guinness World Record aspect of the project, he said the report had to be given in before March.
 I personally believe there are three benefits that will result from this project. Firstly, great fame and glory will be brought to Sri Lanka. Secondly it will have a great impact on tourism. For instance, a few days ago, an entire bus of tourists visited the site and said the only reason they would be staying back would be to see the erected tree. Thirdly, this project will showcase the artistic and creative ability of our people, said Gunasekara. He added that this was merely his personal opinion and that he didnt know how the rest of the public felt, nor as to the views of the Christian community in Sri Lanka since he was a Buddhist himself. 
It had been reported previously that the Buddhist Society of the Ports Authority would be sponsoring the entire project but when Upali De Zoysa of the Society was spoken to about this, he said it was all a misunderstanding. We are not sponsoring the project. It is just that we gave a donation of Rs.10,000 initially as part of the Port Authority. 
When one of the sponsors, Multilac, was contacted, they responded that they were not considering any bigger picture through the project, other than the statement that would be given to the public that Multilac was one of the 3 companies in the world to have led free paint. 
The artist of the Christmas tree, Nanayakkara, described it not as a commercial project but as an artistic creation. We wanted to embark on this to uplift tourism in the country and to bring about religious harmony. Therefore, a team of 10 of us went and spoke to the Secretary to the Minister of Ports and Shipping who got us in touch with the Minister who agreed to help us out. The project started in August with a budget of 12 million. Nanayakkara says that with regards to the funding process, it was merely private companies using parts of their profits to give back to their country. When asked about whether the tree would be completed by today, Nanayakkara didnt sound optimistic, merely stating that the entire skeleton had been made and referred to the delay being due to the stoppage of work due to the concerns that were raised by Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith. I am a Buddhist but I think that religious feelings are felt more when decorations like this are seen by all. This is the same with Vesak lanterns for Vesak and crackers that are lit. Nanayakkara urged the general population to help in this project since there were almost 150 people volunteering presently. We are not being paid a salary and people generously provide us with meals. 
Reverend Edmond Thilakaratne, media director of the Archdiocese of Colombo, clarified that the stance of the Cardinal had always been the same and that was that whatever had to be done should be in the true spirit of Christmas. He is not going to ask anyone to put up trees or to ask them to stop. 
It is not just a decoration. The philosophy behind it is that the tree symbolises life during the winter period. Having the tree within ones home is a symbol of this life. In Church, we make use of the tree to understand this event. Therefore this tree is not out of place at all. It is within the framework of the spirit of Christmas. 
According to Fr. Joseph Benedict, most rituals involved with Christmas were introduced by St. Joseph Vaz, Sri Lankas saint. This was after the coming of the missionaries to Sri Lanka. St. Joseph Vaz travelled around the country to find out how people had been celebrating Christmas and took the initiative to celebrate the feast of Christmas. Originally during the period of Christmas, people would read the Bible together and engage in a service to meditate on the coming of Jesus. On the new initiative, the use of certain objects, including the tree, were also revived. It is not just a decoration. The philosophy behind it is that the tree symbolises life during the winter period. Having the tree within ones home was a symbol of this life. In Church, we make use of the tree to understand this event. Therefore this tree is not out of place at all. It is within the framework of the spirit of Christmas as it
evolves devotion 
Therefore, it seems as though all is festive on the beach, with the star on the tree being the possibility of a Guinness World Record. The cost benefit analysis can, however, only be made after the completion of the tree and balances on the assumption that the expense of 12 million will have positive and long-lasting impact on our tourist industry and arts and crafts of Sri Lanka. This is added with the probability that Sri Lanka does indeed receive the World Record next year. All in all several probabilities pitted against a sum that arguably would have had more evident benefits were they used for bigger social problems. But then again maybe Father Christmas has a stocking full of goodies comingour way!

We will not approve Constitution that will harm unitary status: President
	
President Maithripala Sirisena has told the Global Sri Lanka Forum (GSLF) that the recommendations made by the constitutional sub-committee on Periphery and the Centre Relations were merely proposals, members of the group said on Thursday (22).
Coordinator, Global Sri Lanka Forum (GSLF), a newly formed organization of Sri Lankan expatriates, Nuwan Ballantudawa, told a media briefing on Thursday that President had assured that the recommendations of the subcommittee on periphery and the centre will not be implemented or discussed in Parliament. The President had given this assurance when the GSLF questioned him about recommendations made by the sub-committee. Some of these recommendations including the setting up of a senate, limiting the powers of the governors are going to harm the unitary status of the country. We will not approve a Constitution that is going to harm the unitary status of Sri Lanka, he said.
Further he said the notion that the recommendations made by the sub-committees are merely suggestions cannot be accepted as they have been appointed for some purpose. This was in response to an assertion by Mr Ballantudawa that even President Sirisena was of the opinion that the recommendations of the sub-committee were only suggestions.
Furthermore, the President said the government does not have the mandate to compile a new constitution. The United National Party commands 105 seats in Parliament while the SLFP led UPFA has 95. In these circumstances it is clear that a constitution is being compiled by a government which does not even have a simple majority in the House, Mr Ballantudawa said. He charged that President Sirisena formed a government together with the UNP by violating the mandate given to the UPFA.  How can a man who kept away from the SLFP led UPFA during the general election form a government with the UNP he questioned.
In addition the GSLF said the powers of the provincial councils should be reduced in order to preserve the unitary status of the country. As per the 13th Amendment to the constitution a provincial council can approve or dismiss a Bill pertaining to Parliament by a simple majority while a Bill or a statute pertaining to a provincial council can only be approved or dismissed by the House by a two thirds majority. This clause should be repealed, the organization said.
GSLF is an organization formed by Sri Lankans in countries such as France, UAE, Australia, Japan, Korea, and Canada in September 2016. We are an organization which is committed to safeguarding the unitary status of the country. However we dont have any intention of confronting the Tamil Diaspora though our organization comprises mostly of Sinhalese, the office bearers said. GSLF is to meet all political leaders including the Prime Minister and Tamil National Alliance in the future, they also said. (Yohan Perera)
