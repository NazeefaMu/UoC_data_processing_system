CaFFE urges repeal of PTA
	
The Campaign for Free and Fair Elections (CaFFE) today urged the government to repeal the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA) saying it was misused by the previous regime to suppress media and human rights activists in the country.
CaFFE Executive Director Ranjith Keerthi Tennakoon said the Act was mainly implemented to curtail the freedom of the people.
At a meeting with civil activists in Rajagiriya, Mr. Tennakoon said the Act was used to detain media personnel and several civil society activists without a time limit.
With the scourge of terrorism eradicated some six years ago, the implementation of the PTA is a great obstacle for the individual liberty. Our country has been accused of violating Human Rights by several groups. With a stable government in place, action should be taken to recind the PTA and re-establish a proper civil administration in the country so that people can live without fear, he said.

Provincial councilor Prasanna Solangaarachchi said today SLFPers neither understood him nor voted for him at the last general election.
SLFP supporters did not vote for me. Only my well-wishers, friends and school mates voted for me. If at all there might have only been a handful of SLFPers who voted for me. But I am not angry with them, he said.
Mr. Solangaarachchi told Daily Mirror that people allowed their emotions to take the upper hand but that though he was defeated, his principles were intact.
My political principles were not defeated. People defeated me. I have no qualms about my defeat. The parties which joined the UPFA did their best to defeat the SLFPers, he said.
Mr. Solangaarachchi said former president Mahinda Rajapaksa, who led the UPFAs election campaign at the general election, defeated them, and that they would work with President Maithripala Sirisena so that they would not be defeated again.
People rejected us. That is their right. We cannot take it by force. Former president Mahinda Rajapaksa defeated us and we defeated him. So people feel that we are strong. We will work with President Maithripala Sirisena and other party officials to take the party forward, he said.
Mr.Solangaarachchi said Hirunika Premachandra won the election by contesting on the UNP ticket whereas he had wanted to win the election as a true SLFPer. He congratulated Ms Premachandra on her election victory.
He said they were ready to accept Kuamara Welgama as the opposition leader and that he hoped Mr. Welgama would act with President Maithripala Sirisena and SLFP leaders without going behind defeated leaders.(Sanath Desmond)
