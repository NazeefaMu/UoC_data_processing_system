Beer drinking school girls suspended
	
Ten female students of a leading school in the Southern Province, who had consumed beer and behaved badly inside the classroom, had been suspended, the School Disciplinary Unit of the Southern Province Eduction Department said.
The incident had taken place on World Children's Day.
The principal of the school had made every effort to cover up the incident, but the whole sordid episode became public knowledge after a complaint was made by the parents and teachers to the School Disciplinary Unit (SDU) of the Provincial Education Department, which launched an investigation and found the students guilty.
They had been given a one week suspension from school by the SDU.
On October 1, the students had brought 13 beer cans into the Grade 11 classroom and had consumed them.
Unfortunately for the students a glass filled with beer that was in the hand of one of the girls had fallen on the ground and had shattered spilling the liquid all over the floor of the classroom.
A teacher, who came into the classroom,? had noticed the strange behavior of the girls and complained about the matter. (Janak De Silva)

Bribery Commission receives complaint against Sajith
	
The Socialist Youth Union affiliated to the JVP today filed a complaint against Minister Sajith Premadasa with the Bribery Commission against a recently leaked video clip which purportedly showing him recommending jobs to a group of youth.
National Organiser of the SYU Comrade Eranga Gunasekera said they hoped the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption (BC) would soon start investigations into the complaint.
Speaking to the media while leaving from the Commission premises, Gunasekera said that the Minister had played with tears of the unemployed people, which are around 3.5 million in Sri Lanka, for his personal political agenda.
?The Housing and Constructions Ministry belongs to the government and it is not his private property to give jobs to whoever he wants, based on certain selective methods,? he said.
He also said even though the political appointment were not something new and strange to the Sri Lankan society, this kind of strong evidence had not been publicised earlier. (Piyumi Fonseka)

Cameron allocated ?6m aid to SL after Lankan businessman funded his party
	
Foreign aid from England to Sri Lanka had been significantly increased after a Sri Lankan businessman oversaw donations of more than 1 million British pounds (?) to the Conservative Party, the Daily Mail today reported.
An article published on Mail Online said David Cameron had announced last November that ?6.6 million was being set aside for Sri Lanka over three years, including help for Tamils forced from their homes during the civil war.
In the year before the announcement, the Tory Party registered donations of more than ?1million from businessman Subaskaran Allirajah and his controversial telecoms firm Lycamobile.
There are now questions about what has happened to the money, with UK aid money since going to the area in northern Sri Lanka where Mr. Allirajah grew up.
Subaskaran Allirajah with David Cameron at the Tory's Black and White Ball last year
Mr. Allirajah, 44, is the founder and chairman of Lycamobile, a firm that sells pre-paid phone cards. He grew up in Mullaitivu, a Tamil area in the north of Sri Lanka. He is now worth ?160million and is reportedly the 640th wealthiest person in Britain.
The revelations come after Mr. Allirajah faced scrutiny over claims of tax fraud and money laundering at his firm.
In 2009, the UK ceased aid to Sri Lanka for all but humanitarian emergencies after the end of the civil war in the country.
But after Lycamobile started donating to the Tory Party two years later, funds were allocated to the country from the conflict pool ? a pot set aside for tackling instability overseas.
In 2011, the Tories reported donations of ?176,000 from Lycamobile. This rose to ?250,000 in 2012. In that time, total UK aid to Sri Lanka jumped by more than two thirds to ?5.5 million, with ?1.3 million coming from the conflict pool. By 2013, total aid to Sri Lanka was ?10.2 million, almost ?3 million more than given to Iraq that year.
In November 2013, then-prime minister Mr. Cameron became the first foreign leader to visit the north of Sri Lanka since it became independent in 1948. He called on the non-Tamil president to set up an independent inquiry into alleged war crimes against Tamil people. And he pledged ?2.1 million over two years for a de-mining programme in three districts, including Mullaitivu.
In March 2014, Foreign Office minister Hugo Swire expressed concerns at the arrests of two human rights activists in Sri Lanka, who had been trying to secure the release of a Tamil mother and daughter.
Just 13 days later, the Tories registered donations of ?105,000 from Lycamobile, followed by ?15,000 three days after that.
In the year before Mr. Cameron announced the ?6.6 million to Sri Lanka, the Conservatives reported donations of ?967,000 from Lycamobile and a personal donation of ?100,000 from Mr. Allirajah.
Less than two months before the 2015 general election, Mr. Cameron met Sri Lankan president Maithripala Sirisena, who promised to identify land to return to the Tamils. Six days later, the Tories registered donations of ?370,000 from Lycamobile.
In March 2015, Mr. Allirajah attended the Tory ?black and white? ball in Mayfair, central London. He got the loudest cheer of the night after pledging ?210,000 for a small bronze statue of Margaret Thatcher.
When the Tories made the ?6.6 million announcement last November, it said the money would be spent over the next three years on ?reconciliation, military reform and to help people who were forced from their towns and villages during the civil war?.
The Mail has for more than a month been asking the Foreign Office to disclose exactly how much of the money has been spent and where it has gone, but a spokesman refused.
Lycamobile has donated a total of ?2,209,712 to the Tory Party since 2011.
Some ?569,300 of this has come in 2016, even though the firm has during this time faced a police investigation after three of its workers were filmed dropping off rucksacks stuffed with cash at post offices in London.
In June, 19 people connected to Lycamobile were arrested in a raid in France amid allegations of VAT fraud and money laundering of at least ?13.4million.
Lycamobile has previously denied financial malpractice. The firm and Mr. Allirajah, who lives in a ?3 million mansion with his wife in Chigwell, Essex, had not responded to requests for comment.
A spokesman for the Tory Party said: 'All donations to the Conservative Party are properly and transparently declared.'

The Colombo Fort Magistrate today upheld that the incorporation of the Financial Crimes Investigation Division (FCID) was legal and within the legal powers vested in the Inspector General of Police (IGP).
Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne also rejected legal objections raised by the Counsel appearing for former Minister Wimal Weerawansa's brother Sarath and NFF MP Jayantha Samaraweera, over the legality of establishing the FCID.
The Magistrate observed that there was no obstacle that impeded the FCID from carrying out its investigations.
Earlier, appearing for the suspects, defence counsel moved a written legal objection that the FCID had no jurisdiction or legal power to file cases in Magistrate's Courts since it was not incorporated as a Police Station but only a division by the IGP in contradiction the Criminal Procedure Code.

Founding UN values must be upheld to overcome problems: Mangala
	
The founding principles of the United Nations such as pluralism, human rights, respect for diversity and the principle of working together should be upheld in order to overcome the problems faced by the world at present, Foreign Affairs Minister Mangala Samaraweera said today.
The founding principles of the United Nations such as pluralism, human rights, respect for diversity and the principle of working together should be upheld in order to overcome the problems faced by the world at present, Foreign Affairs Minister Mangala Samaraweera said today.
Addressing an event held at the UN Compound in Colombo to mark the 71st anniversary of the United Nations (UN), the Minister said it was his firm belief that no matter how hard it may seem or how challenging it may be the values upon which the United Nations was founded should be protected.
?The challenges before us in the world are daunting. Effects of climate change, conflict, refugees, rise of violent extremism and intolerance, threats to human rights, terrorism?all these and more pose considerable challenges. That?s why we need to uphold our values,? he said.
He said the UN should take the lead often to create awareness among the people that our planet is too small and our destinies too intertwined for us as human beings not to realise that while we respect diversity, we are ultimately one human family.
While highlighting the UN, Sri Lanka partnership and thanking the UN for its cooperation extended over the years, Minister Samaraweera said the UN has helped the world to achieve a lot over the last 71 years.
?We value the work of the UN in Sri Lanka. The support provided by the UN to us at this important time is invaluable,? he said and thanked the UN Country Team in Sri Lanka for their dedication and commitment in Sri Lanka?s quest of pursuing the goals of strengthening democracy, forging reconciliation, ensuring equitable and inclusive economic development and sustaining peace.
Speaking at the event, UN Resident Coordinator and UNDP Resident Representative, Una McCauley said times are changing in Sri Lanka, and so is the UN.
?We are committed to do things differently. We are investing in innovation with a vision to become a forward-looking UN. During the Secretary-General?s recent visit, he stated that our staff is the backbone of the great work we do in Sri Lanka and I could not agree more,? she said.

Herath named national skipper for Zimbabwe tests
	
At 38, Rangana Herath becomes country?s oldest cricketer to captain the national side after regular skipper Angelo Mathews was ruled out of the Zimbabwe test series with a calf tear.
With vice-captain Dinesh Chandimal not considered for the tour as he was recovering from a thumb injury he suffered during a recent domestic cricket match, the selectors had no option but to invite the spin wizard to take over reigns for the two-match series starting on October 29.
?It?s a great privilege and honour to lead my country but it has come at the cost of our best batsman in the side ?Angelo Mathews. But I am ready to take up the challenge and lead the side,? the aging spinner said adding that he never expected to lead side. ?Not in my wildest dream,? he added.
Herath is country?s top spinner since Muttiah Muralidaran?s retirement and has led Sri Lanka to many victories including the most recent 3-0 drubbing of Australia in the home Test series. He has represented Sri Lanka in 73 test matches and picked up 332 wickets which includes 26 five wickets hauls and six ten wickets hauls.
Sri Lanka are without their most senior batsmen in the side ? Angelo Mathews and Dinesh Chandimal but Herath believes the presence of in-form Kusal Mendis and Dhananjaya De Silva will make it a formidable batting unit. Mathews who was expected to lead the 15-man squad had suffered a calf tear during practice and will be out of action for at least three weeks.
?His calf tear has resurfaced but it?s not a very serious condition. We believe it?s best to rest at least for two to three weeks for it to heal,? said Prof. Arjuna de Silva, a member of SLC?s medical panel.
Mathews missed the last leg of the limited over series against Australia with a calf injury and has complained of a stiff calf during the last few days and on examination doctors have found a calf tear.
Upul Tharanga is likely to replace Mathews in the side. Sri Lanka will play two test matches against Zimbabwe and will also be apart of a limited over tri-series also involving West Indies.
The team will leave early tomorrow to Zimbabwe. (Champika Fernando)

Mahela and Kumar have joined the EU Delegation to help put an end to VAW in Sri Lanka through the 'Let's Hit Violence Against Women for a Six' campaign which will be launched on November 25 to mark the International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women.
"We are delighted to have Kumar and Mahela as our EU envoys," Counsellor Paul Godfrey said.
"Violence against women is a very serious and deep-rooted problem in Sri Lanka. Unfortunately, studies have indicated that perhaps half of women in Sri Lanka have experienced some form of violence. But speaking out in public about the problem has been taboo. The decision by Mahela and Kumar to make a stand on the issue will help make it acceptable to talk about these issues in public as a way of raising awareness about and ultimately, eliminating Violence against women,?
