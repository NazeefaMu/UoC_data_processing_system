Video: Tamil Prisoners' bail plea: Magistrate awaits AG's report
	
	Colombo Additional Magistrate Amila Ariyasena today rejected a bail appeal by Tamil prisoners, who were in remand prison for alleged terrorist involvement, since the Attorney Generals report on them was not received by the TID of the Police.
	The Magistrate made this order considering the submission made by Counsel Senaka Perera and Thushara N. Dasun for the suspects, who contended that the suspects had been in remand custody for more than 18 months without being charged.
	The Counsel also submitted that there were precedents, where bail had been given previously.
	However, the Magistrate asserted that it was essential to consider the Attorney Generals opinion, since the matter concerned the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA).
	The TID told Magistrate that investigations were already concluded and the extracts of the investigations had been sent to the Attorney General for his opinion.
	But they had still not received it. The case was postponed for November 11. (Shehan Chamika Silva)

Taliban overrun district in quake-hit northern Afghanistan
	
Taliban insurgents overran a district in one of the northern Afghan provinces hit by a powerful earthquake this week, underlining the security problems that have hampered efforts to get emergency relief to remote mountainous regions.
Officials said fighters seized control of the district capital of Darqand in Takhar province, on the border with Tajikistan in the early hours of Wednesday, continuing a campaign that has intensified across the country this year.
The area around Darqand is not one where there have been reports of major damage or loss of life from Monday's earthquake, which killed more than 300 people across broad swathes of northern Afghanistan and Pakistan.
But it is well within the impact zone and at least 15 people have been reported killed and more than 40 injured in Takhar province as a whole. (REUTERS)
