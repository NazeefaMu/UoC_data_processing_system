A high-flying lady reduced to tears
	

There was a young fair one occupying a high position in a certain Ministry who used to give arbitrary orders to white collar high-ups in public establishments such as the Customs and the Excise Department.

The after effect of actions taken on such orders provided good grist to media mills.
Meanwhile, several heads of public institutions who feared that meekly carrying out questionable orders by this all powerful lady would jeopardize not only their own future but also that of their children decided that enough is enough. And they leaked out all the dope on the lady.
The talkative Diyawanna member of Panchaudha fame who pounced on the dope gave full exposure to the seamy details of the ladys track-record to a stunned audience in the council the other day.
Following this exposure the lady had to face an avalanche of critical and abusive remarks from various quarters. Reduced to tears, the lady had vowed to take a serious decision in regard to the new development, they say.

Cabinet suspends work, payments of Defence HQ
	
The Cabinet on Tuesday suspended the construction of the Rs. 40 billion Defence Head Quarters Complex (DHC) at Akuregoda and the payments to the private contractor, as the selection of consultancy firm and payments that had been made were done without providing true information to the Cabinet, Cabinet Spokesman Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said today.
The Cabinet Memo presented by President Maithripala Sirisena as the Minister of Defence to this effect had revealed that a huge financial mismanagement, running into billions of rupees, had taken place during the initial stages of the project and all Cabinet Papers pertaining to the project had been prepared on the whims and fancies of the former Defence Secretary, he said.
President Sirisena told the Cabinet that a four member committee appointed to conduct an inquiry on the construction of the DHC has observed that that selection of consultancy firms and their payments have been done without providing true information to the Cabinet.
The proposal sought to suspend the services of the selected private firms and to review the payments made to the said firms, and if the payments were approved by the Cabinet.
Minister Senaratne said the Cabinet has information that Rs. 600 million, out of Rs. 2,200 million paid to the consultancy firm, was paid in excess and the Consultancy firm had been registered with the Registrar of Companies after the tender was offered to the firm by the Defence Ministry.
There is no doubt, that a huge financial fraud has taken place involving this project and the Government would go to the bottom of it and expose the culprits and take legal action against them before long, he said. (Sandun A Jayasekera)

A group of purohitas and Diyawanna members in yahapalanaya are said to be up in arms against the unjust practice resorted to in dishing out jobs in departments and state-owned undertakings coming under the purview of a certain Ministry.

Several members of the family of the purohita handling this Ministry are in active politics and his wife who is incidentally holding a high office in the Ministry, is said to be giving away hundreds of unskilled worker-jobs generated on the initiative of the Ministry only to their supporters in two particular electorates ignoring the requests by other purohitas and ordinary members on the government side.
The heads of the two main political parties in yahapalanaya, on receiving a number of complaints in this regard have decided to work out a scheme for distribution of jobs in the public sector on a just and fair basis, they say

A political authority in the highest echelons has a sibling who has prospered as a businessman. Theirs is an original Blue party family.

This siblings paddy business flourished during the regime of the former strongman whose patronage was readily available. However, later he used all his might to help his own to reach a dizzy height to usher in yahapalanaya.
However, the businessman, a grateful man, has not distanced himself from the former strongman or the latters inner circle. He had also been feeling unhappy over the events that played out following the regime change that caused immense embarrassment to his mentors family members and his close associates.
At a time the businessman was filled with nostalgia for the good old days, he came across a sibling of his former mentor who gained prominence and general acceptance in the country due to his role in the war on terrorism. And they got involved in a friendly chat.
Getting down to more serious subjects, they agreed that the party was heading for a split and they should do whatever they could within their power to prevent such a calamity. The businessman sibling told the other sibling: Sir, we have to proceed on this journey together True, there are differences. If both of us together talk to our man at the top, I am sure, we will be able to iron out all these differences There is no need for other kapuwo. Let us finish this job ourselves.

Guidelines for private bus-fare hike
	
In response to the request made by private bus operators to increase bus fares from July 1, Transport and Civil Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala De Silva yesterday appointed a high-ranking panel to prepare the criteria for such increaments.
At yesterday's discussions held with the minister at the transport ministry, the private bus operators insisted that they be permitted to increase bus fares from July 1 in the wake of the sharp increase in the price of tyres and spare parts and the increase in leasing charges and salaries of the bus crew.
The minister said a panel of high-tanking officials had been appointed by the cabinet in 2001 and 2002 to prepare a criteria for increasing bus fares and as such any increase in bus fares had to follow the guidelines approved by the Cabinet.
However, in 2007 the cabinet appointed another committee to submit a report on increasing bus fares with amendments to the criteria prepared by earlier panel. But the Cabinet had not approved the report because of several grey areas and the difficulty in implementing the recommendations, he said.
However, the minister admitted that the demand to increase bus fares was reasonable in the backdrop of the price increase in consumer items, increased leasing charges and the price increase on tyres and spare parts. He said bus fares could not be based on the views of the private bus operators or the National Transport Commission.
A final decision on increasing bus fares is expected to be taken on the recommendations of the panel appointed by the current minister and with the concurrence of the Treasury, Consumer Affairs Authority, transport professionals and all stake holders connected to the transport sector. The recommendations will have to be approved by the Cabinet as well. (Sandun A Jayasekera)

While rejecting the allegations made by the Joint Trade Union Collective of the Ports Authority, Ports and Shipping Minister Arjuna Ranatunga said today he would resign from politics and go home tomorrow if it was proved he had defrauded a single rupee.
He said the union leaders did not have the backbone to go to the Police, FCID or the Bribery Commission instead of making false allegations against him because they did not have any evidence of fraud.
If I had defrauded any money, they can go to the Police, FCID or the Bribery Commission and make a complaint against me. They are not doing so because they do not have any evidence. They are just criticizing me saying I am a thief. I have sent a letter of demand for Rs.500 million for making false allegations against me, the minister said.
He said those so-called union leaders were making baseless allegations because he had stopped all fraud and corruption in the Ports Authority. (Ajith Siriwardana)

Indonesia vows not to tow stranded Lankans out to sea
	
The Indonesian government said Tuesday (Jun 21) a boatload of stranded Sri Lankan migrants would not be towed back out to sea, after local officials had sparked anger by pledging to send them on their way in a rickety craft.
Authorities will allow those with genuine refugee claims to stay in Indonesia pending permanent resettlement to another country, and send the others back home, an immigration department spokesman said.
Local authorities in the western province of Aceh had previously insisted that the 43 migrants would be sent back to sea to continue their journey to Australia after repairs to their vessel.
The Indian-flagged boat, whose passengers included many women and children, has been stranded by a beach in the town of Lhoknga since June 11 after its engine broke down.
Aceh officials at first refused to let the migrants come ashore, arguing that Indonesia was not their destination, despite pleas from the vice president and rights groups to allow them to disembark.
Tensions boiled over at one point, with authorities firing a warning shot as some desperate women tried to leave the boat.
Amnesty International accused officials of "endangering lives" by firing shots and threatening to push them back out to sea "in flagrant violation of international law".
The migrants, believed to be from Sri Lanka's Tamil minority, were eventually allowed to come ashore at the weekend as bad weather battered the boat, and were housed in tents.
Aceh authorities continued to insist they would send them out to sea again when the vessel was fixed.
But Heru Santoso Ananta Yudha, immigration spokesman in Jakarta, said Tuesday the boat was "no longer seaworthy".
"The bad weather has continued, leading to the boat suffering more damage," he said. "Part of the hull has filled with water and part of the boat is sinking."
International Organization for Migration (IOM) spokesman Paul Dillon added that "Mother Nature has forced the issue as it is impossible for this group to safely remain aboard".
The government had contacted the Sri Lankan and Indian embassies as well as the IOM and UN refugee agency to verify the identity of the migrants, Yudha said.
Dillon confirmed that IOM and refugee agency officials were providing assistance.
Staunchly Islamic Aceh last year took in hundreds of Rohingya, a persecuted Muslim minority from Myanmar, during a regional people-smuggling crisis. But the province said it did not want the Sri Lankans as they were economic migrants. (JAKARTA)

Karunanidhi denies being party to ceding of Katchatheevu
	
DMK chief M. Karunanidhi on Tuesday denied the allegation of Chief Minister J. Jayalalithaa that he was aware of ceding Katchatheevu islet to Sri Lanka and did not oppose the move.
Reacting to the Chief Minister's question that how Karunanidhi was able to add some sections to the agreement, if he was not aware of it, the DMK leader said the DMK pressed for the incorporation of a few sections only after coming to know about the agreement. But, the signing of the agreement was not known to him and it came as a shock for him, he said.
The DMK passed a resolution opposing the agreement and held State-wide demonstrations opposing the move, he said and added that he himself had participated in the demonstrations. DMK members had opposed the move in Parliament in 1974. The Teso headed by the DMK had decided to move the Supreme Court against the ceding of Katchatheevu on April,15, 2013, and later a petition was filed in the Supreme Court on 10 May 2013.
He said Jayalalithaa had written a letter to the Centre on July 23, 2003, stating that the best possible solution is to get the island of Katchatheevu and adjacent seas on lease in perpetuity solely for fishing, drying of nets and pilgrimage. She had said the Sri Lanka's sovereignty over Katchatheevu could be upheld at the same time, the DMK leader alleged.

Love turned to hate
	

There is a certain learned purohita in yahapalanaya whose decorum and polite speech have earned him much respect.

This purohita took everyone in the august assembly by surprise the other day when he visibly simmering in anger fired a broadside at the talkative economist in the JO group.
Soon after, a group of members were having a chat in the House lobby when one of them made a reference to the yahapalanaya stalwarts unusual outburst earlier in the day. When the subject was brought up, a JO high-up noticed a tell-tale smile playing on the face of a dainty young member. The JO high-up thought that there should be some secret hidden behind the fair ones smile. He went up to her and asked her in an undertone what made her smile.
And the dainty fair one revealed the secret to the JO high-up The yahapalanaya purohita who slammed the economist of the JO group was on very intimate terms with a comely lady in politics from the South. Now they have fallen out. A crossover is the cause for their estrangement.
The JO groups economist had praised that comely lady to high heavens at a political party held earlier in the day. The learned purohita had gone into a rage when he heard that the economist had used his oratorical skills to place the lady on a high pedestal. The turn for him to address the assembly came soon after hearing the news that angered him. So he slammed the economist left and right at the first chance that came his way So you see love-turned to hate is a terrible thing, added the young fair Diyawanna member.

Joint Opposition MP Mahindananda Aluthgamage today sent a letter of demand to Deputy Minister Ranjan Ramanayake and Kandy District MP Ananda Aluthgamage demanding Rs. 500 million each, over alleged defamatory remarks made against him.
Mr. Aluthgamage said he would take legal action against the duo, if they failed to pay the amount within two weeks.
Deputy Minister Ramanayake on Tuesday at a news conference alleged Mr. Aluthgamage had used an unregistered Defender vehicle to carryout illegal activities including assaults.
He said the vehicle had been parked at the premises of Parliamentarians Quarters at Madiwela.
Mr. Ramanayake had also claimed that UNP MP Ananda Aluthgamage was the one who gave him the information about the vehicle.
Addressing the weekly news briefing of the Joint Opposition today, MP Mahindananda Aluthgamage denied the allegations and said Deputy Minister of Sports had admitted that the vehicle belonged to him.
The allegations are mere fabrications. Mr. Ramanayake is acting in Parliament as well. He should know that Parliament is not a theatre, where he can fool others by playing different characters, he said.
It was also reported that Mr. Ramanayake and Mr. Aluthgamage had exchanged blows in the Parliamentary complex over the incident.
However, Mr. Aluthgamage denied the reports and said only words were exchanged, not blows. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

New Customs Ordinance detrimental to country: TU
	
The new Customs Ordinance, if implemented, would reduce the powers of Customs Officers, allow more room for criminals to operate and bring the control of the entire Customs Department under a single individual, the Customs Trade Union Alliance charged today.
Amending the 200-year-old Customs Ordinance and bringing in a new one would pave the way for those engaged in smuggling to escape from law enforcement officers, at the same time reducing the powers of Customs Officials, Deputy Superintendent of Customs Lal Weerakoon told the media today.
The new Customs Ordinance was implemented with the support of three persons, who were paid handsomely by the Finance Ministry, he charged. These individuals were initially paid about Rs.9 million by the ministry, while another monthly allowance, including transport, amounting to Rs.13.5 million, was also included in the package offered to them. Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake should tell the truth to the people in this regard, Weerakoon said.
He said the proposed Customs Ordinance was only reformed for the protecting the culprits and to take action against the Customs officers and the final objective would be taking the whole Customs control in to someones hand.
Because of that as Customs Trade Union Alliance, we had taken a decision to stand against bringing the new Customs Ordinance. If anything needs to be amended in the Customs Ordinance that is presently in force, we are ready to give our ideas on that, Weerakoon said.
During the examination of the new Customs Ordinance, it was clear that 68 per cent of the Ordinance had been taken from Customs Ordinance of other countries like Malaysia, Singapore, India, Canada and New Zealand. Then it had been changed according to the Sri Lanka Customs Ordinance, he said.
The present Customs Ordinance was introduced in 1861 and 50 amendments have been made since its enactment.
The Ministry earlier said that the aim of the Government was to amend the Customs Ordinance was to absorb the modern industrial trends in the global market and other relevant technologies to reap maximum benefits for the country and to enable the country to update the import mechanism and minimise trade irregularities.
If this Ordinance was implemented, it would effect national security and the National Income of the country while also threaten the campaigns carried out against narcotics, biodiversity, and genetic resources of the country, he said. (Chaturanga Pradeep)

One-week rupee forwards down on importer dollar demand
	
Sri Lankan one-week rupee forwards fell yesterday due to importer dollar demand a day after Moodys revised down its outlook on the countrys sovereign rating, dealers said.
The local currency was also under pressure due to lack of exporter sales, while moral suasion by the Central Bank prevented spot trade, they added. Moodys Investors Service on Monday affirmed the governments foreign currency issuer and senior unsecured sovereign ratings at B1 and changed the outlook to negative from stable, citing further weakening in some fiscal metrics in an environment of subdued GDP growth which could lead to renewed balance of payments pressure.
One-week dollar/rupee forwards, which have been acting as a proxy for the spot rupee in the absence of trade in three-day forwards on Tuesday, were at 147.30/50 per dollar at 0557 GMT, weaker than Mondays close of 146.75/147.10. The (dollar) demand is there. More than that exporters are not selling dollars, a currency dealer said, asking not to be named.
Dealers said the market was perplexed by the Central Banks intervention in both spot rupee and forwards. Central Bank officials were not available for comment. The Central Bank reduced the spot rupees peg to 144.50 per dollar on Thursday, from 144.75 in the previous session. The spot rupee was not actively traded for a sixth straight session yesterday, dealers said. On June 13, the spot closed at 144.85/95 per dollar. The spot rupee was pegged down from 145.75 levels in early June after the local currency rose following increased dollar conversions by exporters and overseas funds. For a fourth straight day, there was no active trading in three-day dollar/rupee forwards, known as spot next, dealers said.
The forwards closed at 144.85/90 per dollar on Wednesday. Spot next, which has acted as proxy for the spot currency since January, indicates the exchange rate for the day following conventional spot settlement. For yesterdays trade, the spot next settlement takes place three days ahead.
Foreign investors net bought Rs.6.67 billion worth of government bonds in the week ended June 15, Central Bank data showed. Lack of large inflows from exporters, and borrowings were weighing on the currency, dealers said.

Planetary change sends political bigwigs into a flutter
	

Several political party leaders have gone into a flutter over the highly significant planetary change due to take place in August this year.

Yaga-pooja rituals prescribed by astrologers to ward off the malefic influences believed to afflict these leaders as a result of the imminent planetary change are already underway in the residences of these leaders, they say.
The night rituals now being conducted on a regular basis in the residential premises of a certain political party leader in a posh residential area in the heart of the city have become a nuisance to the other residents in the neighbourhood due to the awful din made by the priests conducting the rituals.
Meanwhile, special emissaries of some political leaders carrying the latters Natal Charts have flown to a neighboring country. 
Some of them have already returned with readings done by eminent astrologers of that country.
Naturally most politicos are eagerly waiting to know what the astrologers have said about the political future of their leaders.

Prospective quitters grow in number
	
The number of Diyawanna members who are to quit electoral politics once their term of office is over, is on the increase.

The latest to vow not to contest a general election again is a young comely member  incidentally a first timer to the council - hailing from the Colombo district. She is said to be very unhappy that the people in her electorate affected by the recent floods gave her the cold shoulder when she visited them  rather late in the day  to look into their immediate needs.
Among others determined not to face an election again are two senior politicians hailing from Uva. Both of them are holding high office in yahapalanaya. There is yet another one in this boat from the West. He is a ladies man despite being old enough to be a great-grandfather. In fact, the mans undiminishing interest in the fair sex is a common subject in political circles.
Meanwhile, a veteran from a prominent political family in the South and a senior politician from Wayamba said to be a religious man have confided in their friends that they are not seeking a return to Diyawanna.

Ready to join, but not willing to cohabit with Greens
	

There is a strong rumour doing rounds in political circles that three to four loud-mouthed Diyawanna members from the joint opposition group are set to cross over to the yahapalanaya. 

This piece of news got wings soon after a Diyawanna member of the group from Uva went missing on the day the No-Confidence motion was taken up for debate after giving a solemn undertaking to vote for it.
The member had more important irons in the fire than the obligation to vote for the resolution, they say.  He had to find a safe way out of an impending court case, help his brother to get a coveted high post and above everything he wanted to get at least a deputy office. So he decided to disappear after holding council with a big shot in yahapalanaya. Meanwhile, the government had also held out baits to one member each from upcountry, West and Wayamba. These worthies, they say, had expressed their willingness to do the pole-vault to become part of a Betel leaf government to be formed after throwing the Greens overboard.
These members fear that they would lose their share of the vote segment at the village level still commanded by the former strongman if they throw in their lot with a UNPled government. We do not want to suffer the fate that befell Bibile Soysa, One of the members being wooed by the government had told the go-between the other day.

JVP Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake raised this matter in the House and asked how it had happened .
"This is double the amount sanctioned by Parliament," he said.
Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake said this was an observation made by the Auditor General and that he would explain this matter to the House.
Joint opposition MP Bandula Gunawardane said Parliament had full control over public finances in terms of the Fiscal Responsibility Act, and as a result, he sought a debate on it in the House. He said the newly established Public Finance Committee should take it up.
Joint opposition MP Wimal Weerawansa said he brought it to the notice of the House during the debate on the no-confidence motion against the minister.

Weight pulled by alma mater to determine the race winner
	

The highest post in a big security force is due to fall vacant in another two months and the usual battle between the schools of the hopefuls in the running has already begun.

School names such as Colombo Royal, Nalanda and Maliyadeva are already being mentioned, they say.
The procedure generally followed in filling vacant posts in public service is that when the chief goes, the second in command takes his place. But there were several conspicuous departures from this standard procedure in the recent past. A similar departure from the procedure in regard to filling this high post is expected to bring luck to someone ranking low down in the seniority list. His name is also being mentioned in some circles. For the present, we can only say that it is a name that has been in the usage from the days of Prince Sidhartha.
