COPE should probe coal power deal: Anura
	
The Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) yesterday said parliamentary Committee on Public Enterprises (COPE) should start a probe on the controversial coal power purchase deal which is alleged to have cost the government Rs 1.8 billion.
JVP Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake told a media briefing that COPE should begin a probe and summon the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) officials before the committee.
Mr. Dissanayake said COPE could make some impact on penalising those who are responsible for the fraud if a probe is conducted. COPE could conduct a probe and refer the matter to the Cabinet for action and can make some impact on pressurising the government to take action against those who are responsible if a fraud had taken place, he said.
He said appointing special committees would not make any sense. If there were any allegations against any one during the previous regime, former President used to gather all the files while the present government is appointing committees. Gathering files was Rajapaksas way of handing corruption and appointing committees is the present governments way of handing it. None of these two methods will help nab the corrupt, he added.
Further, he said the committee that had been appointed by the government will not do any good as some of the members of it are involved in the deal.
Meanwhile, the JVP Leader who referred to the arrest of UPFA MP Namal Rajapaksa said it is essential to carry out a proper probe on the deal between the Krrish group and Mr. Rajapaksa as there is no reason for the company to credit cash on the MPs account. Besides, he said Sri Lanka Rugby Foodball Union head had told the FCID yesterday that the fund given by Krrish Group to the union was given back to MP Rajapaksa. A proper investigation has to be carried out as thats what the Sri Lankan people want, Mr Dissanayake added.

The Colombo Fort Magistrate today refused to issue a warrant, through Interpol, for the arrest of a one-time Sri Lankan Ambassador to Russia, Udayanga Weeratunga and directed that summons be forwarded through the Foreign Ministry to his address in Ukraine.
Earlier, he was noticed to provide statements on an investigation being carried out by the FCID.
On July 15, the FCID requested Court to issue a warrant for his arrest as he had absented himself from Court on charges of having caused a financial loss of US$14 million to the Government in connection with the purchase of four Ukraine-built MIG-27 aircraft in 2006.
The Magistrate said that though the prosecution had taken appropriate steps to serve summons to Mr. Weeratunga, the police had been unable to hand it over to him. (Shehan Chamika Silva)

Don't forget lessons learnt from past: SYU
	
While condemning the clash at the Jaffna University, a collective of university lecturers, civil activists, artistes and the JVP allied Socialist Youth Union (SYU) today said the people should look into the incident with a broader and prudent mind considering the sensitiveness of the incident.
A clash erupted on Saturday between two Sinhala and Tamil student factions of the Jaffna University due to a cultural performance at a welcome party held for freshers at the Science Faculty. Close to 20 students were hospitalised with injuries.
The National Organiser of the SYU, Eranga Gunasekara said the politicians, social activists and journalists have a bigger role to play in order to ease the problem without dragging it into a racist hatred mentality.
He appealed to the politicians who use racism to draw peoples attention, not to add fuel to fire.
We have had enough problems during the thirty year bloody war. We would like to appeal especially to politicians not to act in a way the problem is intensified. It is also a responsibility of the people to be prudent in looking into the problem because no one should forget the lessons learnt from the past, he said.
At a time attempts are being made to re-establish reconciliation among all the communities including Sinhala and Tamil, the fight took place between the students factions could cause unnecessary problems in the country, he said.
Mr. Gunasekara stated that the entire Sinhala community does not represent a few of those who maintain racist attitude as well as the Tamil community does not believe in racism as a solution for their problems.
He added that as a country having diverse cultures, beliefs and religions, all the people should respect others cultures and beliefs irrespective of their personal issues that they cannot be agreed with others opinions.
Speaking at the media conference, Senior Lecturer Dr. Nirmal Ranjith Devasiri said the incident should not be considered as an isolated incident.
He also urged the people to think again before making any aggressive comments regarding the Jaffna University clash because such influence should not lead the past be repeated.
Lecturer Thyagaraja Varadas said the clash was only an outcome of the unanswered grievances of the Tamil community in the North which struggled with the thirty year war.
He stressed that unless the necessary intervention of the government is done in order to solve the issue, such incidents would be inevitable in the future.
Meanwhile, Attorney Namal Rajapaksha criticised the authorities of the Ministry of National Co-existence Dialogue and Official Languages for being unable to take any measures to address the issues pertaining to the National Co-existence among the communities of the country.
President of the Young Journalists Association, Journalist Tharindu Uduwaragedara said the media should use the Jaffna University incident to enhance the necessity of re-conciliation, co-existence and unity among the communities.
Journalists should not act according to the whims of the owners of their media institutions in reporting the stories related to the Jaffna incident. We, as journalists have a big role in changing the peoples minds to a better side that will make only good to all of us, Uduwaragedara said.
However, the collective stated that the responsibility of the incident should be borne by the politicians who failed to address the post-war grievances of the Tamil community.
Meanwhile, the JVP allied Socialist Youth Union (SYU) has organized a Literature Week named Week of Brotherhood at Jaffna University starting from July 23. Competitions and events will be held between Sinhala and Tamil students with the purpose of encouraging unity among them. (Piyumi Fonseka)

Even Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe could be arrested: Wimal
	
National Freedom Front (NFF) Leader Wimal Weerawansa today said the Government needed at least one of the Rajapaksas in prison at any given time and that it may even place Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe in jail, because he was also a Rajapaksa.
Addressing a news conference held by the Joint Opposition, he said this was why the FCID had arrested former MP Basil Rajapaksa, when his nephew MP Namal Rajapaksa was released.
It seems anyone with the surname Rajapaksa could be put in jail, so the Government leaders could have a good nights sleep. At this rate, they would even take Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe in, he said.
He charged that the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) had become the mouthpiece of the Government announcing the arrest of political opponents. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Hurdles cleared for LG elections
	
All hurdles will be cleared for conducting the local authorities elections once the committee appointed to sort out delimitation issues submits its report on August 15, it is learnt. 
The committee headed by senior administrative service official Asoka Peiris told Daily Mirror he had, more or less, finalised his work in sorting out discrepancies in the delimitation of electoral wards to conduct the next election under a new system - a mix of the Proportional Representation System and the First Past the Post System. 
According to the present law, the subject Minister has to announce the electoral wards in a gazette notification for the polls to be conducted by the Elections Department. Also, the subject Minister has to announce the number of members
to be elected. Once the report is out, Local Government and Provincial Councils Minister Faizer Musthapha will get the opportunity to act for conducting the election. 
One third of members will be elected on the proportional representation basis and the rest on the First Past the Post system. Mr. Peiris told Daily Mirror more than 5000 electoral wards would be created. He identified shortcomings in around1800 wards. 
Mostly, there were issues such as the creation of wards without reflecting the multi-ethnic character of the areas concerned.
We corrected it. Instead of multi-member wards, we converted them to single member seats. It means two single member wards were created in place of one multi-member seat, he said. Mr. Peiris said he also remained engaged with the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) regarding ward creation in the North and the East. 
Already, the Supreme Court has been petitioned seeking to conduct the election as soon as possible. Altogether, there are 335 local bodies in the country. (Kelum Bandara)

JHU condemns Jaffna University clash
	
Jathika Hela Urumaya (JHU) National Organiser Nishantha Warnasinghe yesterday condemned the clash between two student factions, which occurred at the Jaffna University campus last Saturday.
Addressing a media briefing, Mr. Warnasinghe said they could not condone the clash, which had aroused separatism and racism once again in the country as the clash had erupted due to a cultural performance.
The cultural performance was included in the welcome ceremony, which has been arranged for freshmen at the Science Faculty. The students of the Arts Faculty, including Tamils, had opposed the event and later attacked the students of the Science Faculty. Sinhala students of Jaffna University have lost their equality in rights, considering this incident, he said.
He said there were many other functions that took place at all Universities around the country and Sinhala students had never opposed the functions of any other religion or community. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)

Mastercard unveiled a new logo first time in two decades
	
Mastercard redesigns its iconic logo for the digital age, as its familiar orange and red circles
just got a facelift.
The credit card company rolled out a minimalist new logo on Thursday  its first redesign in
twenty years. The new brand identity is created by design firm Pentagram, the new look will
roll out in the fall in conjunction with a new secure digital payment system, Masterpass.
Instead of interlocking in the middle as they previously did in the old one, the two circles now
blend into one another in a design that looks exactly like a Venn diagram.
In the old logo, the word MasterCard was rendered inside the interlocking circles. In the new
logo, the word is outside the circles. This change makes the mark more flexible - it easily
can be placed horizontally or vertically.PentagramIn the old logo, the letters M and C were capitalized; in the new one, all the letters arelowercase. The result is a visual aesthetic to the contemporary world.PentagramThis change fits with what seems to be the prevailing style in corporate logo design right now simple onedimensionalshapes, minimalist and seriffreebasic fonts that translate betterin digital formats. Verizon and Google have all moved in the same direction in the past year.The new logo is also meant to mark the company's move into online payment platforms andevolving financial services tech.
