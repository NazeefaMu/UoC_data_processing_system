APL reaffirms commitment to Sri Lanka
	
From Left - Ikram Ghazali, Director - APL and CMA CGM for Sri Lanka and Maldives; Thomas Casutto - Chief Commercial Officer, APL; Nicolas Sartini, Chief Executive Officer ? APL; Michel Azrak, Regional Commercial Director ? APL; and Eranga Wijesinghe, Head of Commercial - APL for Sri Lanka and Maldives.
APL reaffirmed its commitment to contribute to Sri Lanka?s regional hub ambitions as the global ocean carrier inaugurated its new office premises in the business centre of Colombo.
APL, which celebrates 170 years of global shipping in 2018, said that Sri Lanka?s neighbouring economies such as Bangladesh and India that trans-ship significant cargo volumes via Colombo have continued to grow robustly, auguring well for Sri Lanka?s prospects as an Indian Ocean hub.
Colombo began container operations with APL when vessel SS President Tyler first berthed in Queen Elizabeth Quay (QEQ) in December 1973.Having served Sri Lanka for the last 45 years, APL expressed its commitment to keep sailing this voyage with Sri Lanka as she pursues Vision 2025; and builds her new port city to promote the country as a trading hub.
Sri Lanka?s Vision 2025 involves a trade policy revamp to enable an export-driven economy; and port infrastructure and services expansion to capture the growing trans-shipment trade across production networks in the East and markets in the West. As a global carrier, APL will support the course by facilitating market connectivity through reliable shipping services and solutions.
Customers at the new office
Today, APL offers six weekly mainline services including the Far East Express 6 (FX6), China India Express (CIX) and Pendulum Loop 1 (PE1) services among others. FX6 links Sri Lanka to the key European ports of Rotterdam, Felixstowe and Hamburg. CIX connects Colombo to Central China, South China, Singapore and the Indian ports of Nhava Sheva and Pipavav. Meanwhile, PE1 offers an extensive coverage across Southeast Asia before calling Colombo and then bound for the U.S. East Coast.
Going the extra mile for shippers, the carrier also pledges to elevate customer service experience through active engagements. In fact, APL was recently lauded as the 'Best Carrier for Customer Service in the Trans-Pacific Trade Lane' at the Institute of Chartered Shipbrokers' 24th Award Ceremony in Sri Lanka. This award marks a vote of recognition for APL?s service excellence by customers and peers in the industry.
Sri Lanka sits strategically in the middle of the Indian Ocean and the Maritime Silk Road, making her a critical gateway for an efficient cargo flow within and beyond the Indian Subcontinent. Sri Lanka remains an important market for APL?s development in the Indian Subcontinent where APL has also started commercial operations in Maldives in March this year.

China fires back on tariffs
	
?Imports from the U.S. are seen at a supermarket in Shanghai, China.?
?
China hit back quickly on Wednesday against the Trump administration?s plans to impose tariffs on $50 billion in Chinese goods, retaliating with a list of similar duties on key U.S. imports including soybeans, planes, cars, beef and chemicals.
The speed with which the trade struggle between Washington and Beijing is ratcheting up ? China took less than 11 hours to respond with its own measures ? led to a sharp selloff in global stock markets and commodities. [MKTS/GLOB]
U.S. President Donald Trump, who has long charged that his predecessors served the United States badly in trade matters, rejected the notion that the tit-for-tat moves amounted to a trade war between the world?s two economic superpowers.
?We are not in a trade war with China, that war was lost many years ago by the foolish, or incompetent, people who represented the U.S.,? Trump wrote in a post on Twitter early on Wednesday.
Because the actions will not be carried out immediately, there may be room for manoeuvre. Publication of Washington?s list starts a period of public comment and consultation expected to last around two months. The effective date of China?s moves depends on when the U.S. action takes effect.
U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said in an interview with CNBC that it would not be surprising if the U.S. and China trade actions led to negotiations, although he would not speculate on when this might happen.

Fast track UNP reforms without sitting on your laurels: Champika
	
UNPers should accelerate their party reforms without allowing victory over the no-confidence motion against the Prime Minister to overwhelm them, Minister Champika Ranawaka said today.
He said it was an important the victory for the people rather than a victory in parliament.
The minister said at the Local Government election the UNP had only obtained 28 percent of the votes and this would reduce further if the United National Front (UNF) continued with the same strategy and face a similar fate to that of the SLFP.
The minister said to fulfil the people?s mandate received at the 2015 presidential and general elections it was vital to remove all those involved in financial crimes and provide the space to the youth to take to politics.
He said the UNP needs to be radically reformed and the President and the Prime Minister should support the moves for change and pointed out that there could be a split in the SLPP following the defeat of the motion on April 4. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

Johann Peries?s confident steps on Mount Everest, a giant leap for Sri Lanka
	
Johann and friends flying together for the first leg of the journey, from Colombo to Doha.?
Months of physical and mental preparation have culminated in the departure of a brave son of Sri Lanka, Johann Peries, on his second attempt to scale Mount Everest. Setting off for the two-month expedition, Johann hopes to be successful on this attempt to scale Mount Everest and make his country proud.?
Johann Peries and Jayanthi Kuru-Utumpala were the first Sri Lankans to attempt to summit the peak of 8,848m above sea level in April 2016. However, Johann managed to reach a height of 8,400m, a mere 448m short of reaching the summit, before technical difficulties forced him to descend.
??
Not one to give up easily, this time round, Johann is part of a larger team led by International Mountain Guides (IMG), a globally renowned mountaineering company, with experience in leading several successful Mt. Everest expeditions.?
Enthused by the support and love from fellow Sri Lankans for his courage to scale the world?s highest peak, ?Climb Everest with Johann? was launched to make every Sri Lankan feel they are part of Johann?s journey. Each step taken by Johann on the mountain can be sponsored for Rs.100 per step and sponsors can support as many steps as they want. The expedition fees include IMG?s logistical support, Sherpa and guide support, all climbing permits, expedition food and accommodation, porterage, communications, oxygen, insurance and helicopter rescue, as well as regular access to the IMG medical clinic at Everest Base Camp.?
An Everest expedition requires a large financial commitment and every step sponsored by you will go towards financing the expedition and covering all the associated costs. The total cost of the expedition amounts to USD58600.?
Being a dedicated outdoor adventurer and mountaineer, Johann leads an active lifestyle, with regular fitness training. Training for his second attempt to scale Mount Everest, included cardio, high intensity cardio, strength training, swimming and yoga; high-altitude fitness training including jogging, running and climbing in Nuwara Eliya to get accustomed to a higher altitude; long-distance swimming; special high-altitude training in Ladakh in January 2018 and rock-climbing.
Johann has an impressive track record in mountain climbing apart from his first attempt at Mount Everest in April-June 2016 where he reached a height of 8,400m, a mere 448m short of the Everest peak, before being forced to give up the climb due to technical difficulties. Before that, Johann was part of a four-member Sri Lankan team to successfully summit the highest mountain in Africa, Mt. Kilimanjaro. Their expedition was via the Lemosho Route, which is the longest route to the summit, thereby allowing the team maximum time for acclimatization and thus a safe summit attempt.
Johann was one of the only two from a five-member team of climbers to successfully summit Island Peak in Nepal, in 2012. Due to the climb?s technically challenging nature, Island Peak is considered by many to be one of the training peaks to be summited in preparation for expeditions to the summit of Mt. Everest.
An artist inspired by nature, Johann is a hair-designer by profession and adventurer by choice. His passion for the great outdoors and his creative soul have struck a perfect balance and is evident in his work, life and interests. Johann began his hair-designing career 25 years ago. Taking his innate flair in the beauty and fashion culture a step further, he re-established the local industry to meet international standards by introducing new concepts in bridal-designs and attire, conceptualizing and make-up. Today he is one of the most sought after hair and beauty designers, and amongst the few Sri Lankans in the industry to be globally-acclaimed. Presently Johann runs seven salons, four in Sri Lanka, two in Melbourne and one in the United Kingdom.
His career as an artist began long before his venture in to the fashion industry; initially as a professional singer with Mary Anne Singers spanning over 20 years, as an actor in the local English theatre, and as a professional dancer competing and performing at local and international levels. Johann?s interest in exploring the great outdoors was impressed upon him at a very young age by his father, when the duo regularly explored the Knuckles Mountain range in Sri Lanka. This passion drives him to conquer mountains both in Sri Lanka and around the globe.?

More exit points are to be opened at Pinnaduwa and Godagama interchanges on the Southern Expressway (E01) during the Sinhala and Tamil New Year, Expressway Operation Maintenance and Management Division said yesterday.
Speaking to the Daily Mirror Southern Expressway Deputy Director R.A.D. Kahatapitiya said the decision was taken to minimise the traffic congestion at the exit points.
?One exit point will be added more to the Pinnaduwa and Godagama interchanges while converting entrance points as exits or changing two-way exit and entrance points as exits. The number of exit points would be increased considering the traffic congestion,? he said.
Mr. Kahatapitiya said the drivers who use the expressways for the first time should be cautious to check their vehicle conditions.
?People who use the expressway for the first time should consider their vehicles tyre condition, fuel and radiator water levels before entering. More people will use the expressways to return to their homes during the new year. Sudden breakdowns will take more time consuming to reach the expressways maintenance,? Mr. Kahatapitiya said.
Vehicles will be compelled to maintain maximum speed to 100 kmph and the drivers exceeding the limit will be fined,? he said. (Chaturanga Samarawickrama)

The vote on the no-confidence motion against Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe reflects the vibrant democracy in Sri Lanka and the government should seize the opportunity to further strengthen the team that wants to undertake reforms, a delegation of the European Parliament Committee on International Trade (INTA) said today.

Addressing a news briefing held today at the EU Embassy in Colombo, INTA Standing Rapporteur for South Asia Sajjad Karim said the no-confidence motion was a democratic exercise and an internal matter for Sri Lanka.
?I?m not going to comment on the dynamic of that but certainly I do feel that Sri Lanka and the government in an opportunity to strengthen the team further, the team that genuinely wants to undertake the type of thing I described right at the outset, as to the types people of Sri Lanka wants to see which includes lifting the standards of the people and making the country strong. So I hope this opportunity would be seized upon,? he said.
Meanwhile, the Chair of the delegation Jan Zahradil also reiterated that the no-confidence motion was a good exercise of democracy.

Parliament of Sri Lanka leading the way in  SDGs globally
	
?We are the first parliament in the world to have provided leadership with regards to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG)? said Speaker of the Parliament, Karu Jayasuriya at #SDGDataLK. This national symposium, the first of its kind, was held recently at Water?s Edge. The goal of this gathering was to provide a platform to enhance the use of data towards a Sustainable Sri Lanka.?
This would be done under the theme ?Data for Effective Policy Making and Implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals?.
?With more than 300 participants, this two-day symposium was jointly organised by the Government of Sri Lanka and the United Nations and brought together multiple stakeholders from the Government, UN Agencies, Private Sector, Civil Society Organizations, Academia, and Data and Research organizations, to discuss the importance of using data towards evidence-based policy and decision-making.??
Excerpts from the opening day follow:??
?The UN extends its support to Sri Lanka in mapping local data to the SDGs?
According to UN Resident Coordinator a.i. Ms. Simrin Singh, the Sustainable Development Goals are not necessarily UN SDGs, but in fact owned by all of us. ?Sri Lanka alongside 192 countries committed to this ambitious agenda by agreeing to achieve 17 global goals by 2030. These goals will define Sri Lanka in 2030 and ensure a better tomorrow for all of us,? said Singh.??
She explained how data tied into the idea of achieving these goals as being the starting point in knowing several factors such as the level of poverty, life expectancy and levels of education. ?Knowing this crucial information helps to drive decisions to understand where we are now, where we need to get to and to guide us in getting there. This symposium is relevant in our journey in achieving these goals,?she added.??
Baseline data mapped against these indicators will tell us where Sri Lanka stands at present in relation to SDGs and this is the starting point. ?The UN extends its support to Sri Lanka in mapping local data to the SDGs and will ensure that no one is left behind,?said Singh.??
We can?t wait till 2030. We have to decide on the frequency through which we will monitor the progress in achieving these goals
?The 2030 vision is institution oriented ?
Prof. Mohan Munasinghe, Chairman of the Presidential Expert Committee on Sustainable Sri Lanka 2030 Vision, summarised that the idea of the symposium is to show how important data is and how it fits in the overall development. ?Our Sustainable Development Goals process has data indicators and targets and hopefully the priorities we have identified will help to inform that process. The 2030 vision is not a political manifesto but we hope it is practical as it is institution oriented and the ultimate goal is to build a national consensus on sustainable development,? said Munasinghe.??
The Professor highlighted that the key vision that the President enunciated at the UN General Assembly is that Sri Lanka wants to become a sustainable upper middle income Indian Ocean hub with an economy which is prosperous competitive and advanced, environment that is green and flourishing and a society that is inclusive harmonious peaceful and just which will follow the middle path on balanced green growth. ?The report hopefully guides us towards this balanced path and takes us from 2018 to this sustainable vision of 2030 and in the process we need to transform our values and institutions,?he said.?
According to Munasinghe the Committee has identified several sectors as well as cross-cutting themes like gender and reconciliation. The integration has been done by first making an effort to integrate between the environment, economy and society which has not been done in this country before.??
?Then we link up the sector and the cross cutting themes it is a holistic process. What this nexus means for development globally is that there is this concept called ecological footprint of humanity which says that by 2030 we would need the equivalent of two planet earths to sustain life as it is on this planet. If we look at who is doing all this consumption it is the rich who consumes 85% of the planet?s resources, so there is huge inequality in the consumption. You see that if the rich are consuming more than one planet worth where are the resources for the poor? That?s why we have so many unkept promises and now we are down to the last leg, the SDGs, and that?s why we have to make it work,? he added.??
The Professor said that the 17 SDGs should be adapted to fit our needs where the country fixes the priorities and the SDGs provides a framework.. The Committee has a special focus on social issues since the President is keen on that. Munasinghe highlighted that Sri Lanka has to find this inclusive green growth path to development.??
?As a policy making body we need data for policy decisions?.
According to R.H.W.A. Kumarasiri, Additional Secretary to the Ministry of National Policies and Economic Affairs, the Government is responsible for streamlining the development agenda for 2030, for all departments and ministries, and is responsible for collecting and analysing data. ?The Department of Census and Statistics is only responsible for 75 indicators while other Government agencies are responsible for 131 indicators which is more than 50% of the total,? Kumarasiri said.??
Kumarasiri explained that there is a lot of data at the grassroots level, and as Government agencies they are tasked with collecting that data, summarising it, analysing it and providing it in line with the SDG 2030. ?As a policy making body we need data for policy decisions,?added Kumarasiri.??
?Everyone needs to be part of the equation.?
Karin Fernando, Senior Research Professional from CEPA, highlighted that the big point of the SDGs is to leave no one behind. ?Everyone needs to be part of the equation. This is a challenge. The challenge is also more complex when the goal is not to leave anyone behind. The goal also talks about not letting people fall behind as well. We also need to think about these people as much as capturing those that are not. Therefore it is necessary to collect more nuanced data,?explained Fernando.??
?There might be discrepancies and we should recognise them.?
Dr. Mark Landry, Regional Advisor of WHO South East Asia, detailed how in July 2016 the Ministry of Health organised a workshop on the health related SDGs which illustrated several issues. ?There is still a lack of clarity as to the definition of metadata. We also need to acknowledge new indicators,? said Landry. He emphasised how there is a global health estimate for a number of these indicators. The question is whether that estimate is valid and if not how we dispute that with our national primary data. ?There might be discrepancies and we should recognise that,? he stressed.??
?It?s high time to start our work in a systematic manner.?
Director General of the Department of Census and Statistics, Dr. A.j. Satharasinghe, gave a detailed description of the activities of the DCS in its work with the SDGs. ?Already 3 years have passed and it is high time to start our work in a systematic manner. The Government of Sri Lanka is expecting to achieve these goals by 2030. There are now 12 years to achieve this,? said Satharasinghe.??
According to him all 244 indicators are not relevant to Sri Lanka. ?We have to localise this. For this we need to estimate baseline data for the indicators relevant to the country. Then we have to decide where we are going and what values we would like to see for the identified indicators in 2030. We can?t wait till 2030. We have to decide on the frequency through which we will monitor the progress in achieving these goals,?said Satharasinghe.? ?
He detailed that the DCS had done a study about a year back to identify the indicator framework giving all the corresponding information. ?We tried to prepare the indicator framework in respect of the indicators prepared by the DCS. First I formed a high level committee which looked at the indicators published by the UN Statistics Division which provides the metadata of the indicators. They studied the metadata file on each indicator. This gives enough information and definitions about the indicators and we should all look at it. Just looking at the indicator would make it very complicated.?
After that the DCS came out with a classification system in respect for the indicators compiled by the DCS. The UNSD has come out with a clear classification system, but I thought it wasn?t enough for Sri Lanka to start with, so we came up with another system. With regard to some indicators we have baseline data, and for some indicators the definitions are exact UN definitions and for some there are no exact UN definitions but proxy indicators which is encouraged by the UN as well. Some indicators are not compiled by the DCS because our mandate is to compile demographic and socio-economic data,? said Satharasinghe.??
The 2030 vision is not a political manifesto but we hope it is practical as it is institution oriented and the ultimate goal is to build a national consensus on sustainable development
?It?s unique that?Sri Lanka has a focus area on data?
Chair of the UN Sustainable Development Framework Driver 1, Ritsu Naken stated that the UN has been honoured to support the SL process and the UNSD framework is a 5-year business plan. ?It is truly unique that Sri Lanka has a focus area on data which many other countries do not have,? said Naken.??
?The Sri Lankan health sector has been achieving a great deal and Sri Lanka is a model country in this regard. The survey reveals that 90% of women give birth with a professional health sector worker. It sounds good, but to achieve the SDGs we have to look at the remaining 10% and how we can achieve the remaining percentage. For this we need multidisciplinary data and analysis of that data to understand why this 10% is left behind,? he added.??
?As a committee we are pushing this agenda.?
Chairman of SDG Parliamentary Select Committee Thilanga Sumathipala explained how the Government has found that it is important that the drive for SDGs is the responsibility of Parliament.??
?After a conference 2 years ago I put forward a paper to Parliament that it is good to have a select committee on SDGs. This is the highest committee this country can have. What happens is that institutes like the DCS can present its case and Parliament and initiate a steering role to drive the process. We can?t do this without the help of UN agencies,? said Sumathipala.??
According to Sumathipala, a gap in data collection and usage has been identified. Innovative ideas such as the usage of a dashboard and uniformity in the IT platform that is being used are being considered, so that from the GM division to the higher levels there will be a synchronization of data.?
?We also have more than 60,000 graduates, so in each GM division we can have an SDG officer to work on the collection of data.
The Government can prioritize what SDGs it wants to work on. For any policy to be ready for the country and the availability of data are matters that have to be spearheaded by the bureaucrats, so we are trying to bridge that gap as well. As a committee we are pushing this agenda,?he added.?

President betrays again: Namal
	
Joint Opposition member MP Namal Rajapaksa yesterday in a tweet said President Maithripala Sirisena?s habit of betrayal had been proved once again during the voting of the no-confidence motion against Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.
MP Rajapaksa said President Sirisena had initially encouraged Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) members to support the no-confidence motion and then backed away betraying both the SLFP and the United National Party (UNP).
#SriLanka President @MaithripalaS?s habit of betrayal proven again at #NoConfidenceMotionSL against Prime Minister @RW_UNP. First he encouraged SLFP members to support it and then backs off. He has betrayed both the SLFP & UNP.
? Namal Rajapaksa (@RajapaksaNamal) April 4, 2018
He also tweeted that Minister Susil Premajayantha and other seniors of the SLFP had decided to take an ethical and firm stand supporting the no-confidence motion.
He added that they had given priority to the stability and future of the country.
Hon Minister Susil Premajayantha & seniors of @SLFreedomParty have opted to take an ethical & firm stand by supporting the #NoConfidenceMotion
It?s clear that they?ve given precedence to the stability and future of #SriLanka & #lka people over all else.

President had no hand in it: Samarasinghe
	
While stressing that President Maithripala Sirisena had no hand in the unsuccessful No Confidence Motion against Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, Ports and Shipping Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe added that the 16 SLFP members in the government voted for the motion on their own volition.
He stressed that President Sirisena had never instructed to vote in favour of the motion, against it or abstain from voting in Parliament. What he told the SLFP Parliamentary group was to take an independent decision on how to vote and it must be a collective decision by all because he did not expect a division in the party on this issue.
Addressing the media at the SLFP head office today, Minister Samarasinghe said the No Faith Motion was entirely a scheme of the joint opposition and it was never presented to the SLFP Central Committee or to the SLFP Parliamentary Group and as such President Sirisena did not instruct the SLFP Parliamentary group at any time either to vote for, against or abstain.
President Sirisena?s concerns were the welfare of the country, people and the Yahapalana Government. He convened the SLFP Parliamentary group on Tuesday (13) and clearly told them that whoever won the No Faith Motion he was the Head of State, head of the government and leader of the SLFP. Therefore, he had to safeguard and ensure the interests of the country, the nation, the people and the SLFP. He would continue to rule the country as usual from the 5th and beyond, Minister Samarasinghe said.
?If any one claims that President Sirisena was involved in the drafting, collecting signatures or presenting the No Faith Motion in Parliament, we reject it,? he said.
The real motive behind the No Faith Motion was to divide the SLFP and weaken and desolate him. The target is not the Prime Minister as they claimed, Minister Samarasinghe said.
Minister Samarasinghe said the No Confidence Motion was a total flop and it had now boomeranged on those who brought it. Even two out of four government benchers who signed the motion did not support it on Wednesday night.
Asked as to what would be the position of the SLFP ministers who voted in favour of the motion, Minister Samarasinghe said President Sirisena and Prime Minister Wickremsinghe would decide on their fate and added those who did not vote for the motion (abstained) will not have any problem to remain in the ?Yahapalana Government?.(Sandun A Jayasekera)

RIGHT OF REPLY Front groups,  poor farmers and  tobacco barn owners
	
This article is penned in response to the article which featured comments from ?All Ceylon Tobacco Barn Owner?s Association? and published on March 31 in the Daily Mirror. The article by the Tobacco Barn Owner?s Association was published in response to an article by Dr. Mahesh Rajasuriya, titled, ?Manipulative tobacco cultivation no more a profitable livelihood. Tobacco Free Nation: Sri Lanka?s Dream? published on March 26.??
Comments of Dr. Mahesh Rajasuriya:??
Comments like, ?The tobacco industry has a long history of using front groups which often have had hidden links with the tobacco industry?, according to tobaccotactics.org (University of Bath, UK), are well researched and documented. A front group is ?An organisation that purports to represent one agenda while in reality it serves some other party or interest whose sponsorship is hidden or rarely mentioned.? Creating and using front groups, according to the World Health Organisation (WHO), is a well-known tactic used by the tobacco industry (http://www.who.int/tobacco/publications/industry/interference/en/) to realise its goals and aspirations.??
Associated with the above ?Response to Daily Mirror Article ?Manipulative tobacco cultivation no more a profitable livelihood. Tobacco Free Nation: Sri Lanka?s Dream? dated Monday, 26th March 2018?, I clearly note at least two organisations/groups, if not three.? ?
The Centre for Combating Tobacco (CCT), Faculty of Medicine and University of Colombo stand by the findings of the research work we have done in collaboration with the Presidential Task Force on Drug Prevention
The specialized public relations arm of a well-known advertising company in Sri Lanka, whose ?spectrum of services encompasses External Image Building and Management for corporate clients, brands and individuals, Country and Reputation Management, Crisis Management and Media and PR Event Coordination and Management?, is one associated organisation. The ?response? has been sent to Daily Mirror through a PR coordinator of this specialized public relations arm!??
In addition to this specialized public relations arm and the advertising company, the other organisation that is noted here is the ?author? of this ?response?, namely, All Island Cigarette Tobacco Barn Owners? Association (BOA). BOA doesn?t appear to have a website to declare its interests and source of funding and our previous attempts to make inquiries haven?t been successful. It?s quite clear that the poor tobacco farmer doesn?t readily identify with the more affluent Barn Owners.??
I can?t help, but recall what WHO states: The [tobacco] industry has a long history of using seemingly independent ?front groups? to advance its case.??
In this context, I am not sure whether replying to each accusation mentioned in this ?response? from BOA is actually needed, as readers can decide for themselves the objectives and interests of this group as well as the above organisations.??
However, I want to state here that there have been instances where some good people in front groups have become whistle-blowers! We encourage such men and women of this country who work for front groups of tobacco industry to contact us, CCT (tobaccounmasked@gmail.com; 011 2581571; 0769 233435)??
The specialized public relations arm of a well-known advertising company in Sri Lanka, whose ?spectrum of services encompasses External Image Building and Management for corporate clients, brands and individuals
Finally I wish to state that the Centre for Combating Tobacco (CCT), Faculty of Medicine and University of Colombo stand by the findings of the research work we have done in collaboration with the Presidential Task Force on Drug Prevention.? ?
Last but not least I am curious as to why the BOA has failed to point out its stance, or the ?corrected position? on this particular finding made by CCT: Farmers are more willing to give up tobacco cultivation with the Government?s support. However, the barn owners (the tobacco industry?s) extended arm in the farming community, are not that willing.

Salman Khan gets five years in jail for poaching
	
An Indian court has sentenced Bollywood superstar Salman Khan to five years in jail for poaching rare antelope back in 1998, the BBC reported today.
The court in Jodhpur also fined him 10,000 rupees ($154; ?109) for the crime. He will now be taken to jail.
Khan killed the two blackbucks, a protected species, in the western state of Rajasthan while shooting a film.
Four other actors who starred with him in the movie and were also charged with the offence have been acquitted.
Khan, 52, can appeal against the verdict, but in a higher court.
Correspondents say he will have to spend at least a few days in prison.
This is the fourth case filed against the actor in connection with poaching animals during the filming of the 1998 movie Hum Saath Saath Hain.
He has been acquitted in three of them.
In 2006, a trial court convicted the actor in two cases of poaching and sentenced him to five years in prison. The Rajasthan high court suspended the sentence the following year, and eventually acquitted him in 2016.
The state government has appealed against that order in the Supreme Court.
The original poaching case against him was filed by the local Bishnoi community, who revere and worship the blackbuck.
In December 2015, Khan was cleared in a 2002 hit-and-run case in which a homeless man died and four others were in injured. His car allegedly ran over them while they were sleeping on a street in the western city of Mumbai.
A lower court had convicted him in May 2015. During his trial, Khan had argued that his driver had been behind the wheel, but the judge said it was the actor who had been driving under the influence of alcohol.
Seven months later, the high court acquitted him. It said that key evidence - including testimony from a policeman who had since died - was not reliable.
In January 2017, Khan was also acquitted in another case that charged him with using illegal firearms to kill the blackbucks.

## Title: Social Media is only a Tool

Social Media is only a Tool
	
In an interview with the Daily Mirror Ambika Satkunanathan, one of the Commissioners at the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka said that social media is only a tool that is used to incite hatred or violence and that it isn?t the cause of hatred or violence. She said that when impunity isn?t addressed perpetrators are emboldened as a result of which they continue to commit such offences. Therefore, she stressed that in order to prevent the recurrence of such acts perpetrators should be held accountable. 
?
Excerpts:?
Not only those who participate in such violence, but also those who instigate violence and provide organizational strength have to be made accountable
	Violence appears to have been instigated by external elements in an organized manner causing communal division, death and destruction of property? ?
	It?s possible without impinging on anyone?s right to privacy to map and even predict violence that is about to happen? ?
	Reason for the rise or prevalence of religious or communal violence is the failure and inability to address existing intolerance and the lack of respect for diversity and pluralism within society? ?
	Take a multipronged approach to deal with issues of communal, ethnic or religious intolerance or violence
	So the purpose particularly in post-war countries is to assist people who have been affected by the war to rebuild their lives
Q We speak of reconciliation in the post-war context, but now there has been a rise in communal violence. What is the reason behind this??
I think the reason for the rise or prevalence of religious or communal violence is the failure and inability to address existing intolerance and the lack of respect for diversity and pluralism within society, i.e. the intolerance of difference. In the post-war context it is also important to address the root causes of the conflict. So issues of inequality, discrimination and marginalization have to be dealt with. During the month of May in 2017 the HRCSL wrote to his Excellency the President and we pointed to the rise in religious intolerance and attacks on certain religious groups and called for action. In particular, we called for the perpetrators to be arrested and brought to justice. When you don?t address issues of impunity those who perpetrate such acts of violence will be emboldened and think that they can continue to commit such offences and get away with it.The failure to address impunity erodes respect for the rule of law. The failure to address impunity in cases of religious or communal violence also creates the belief that intolerance is acceptable and that inciting religious or communal violence is acceptable which leads to the erosion of the social fabric. Religious or communal hatred and violence should not become normalized; we should be angered and outraged by them. But outrage alone is not enough. We need action. Therefore, you have to take a multipronged approach to deal with issues of communal, ethnic or religious intolerance or violence.? ?
Q? After the letter to the President in May last year was action taken against the perpetrators?
We have found that adequate action has not been taken to address these issues.? ?
Q What are the findings of HRC?s investigations when it comes to the recent incidents of communal violence??
The investigations are still continuing and our Kandy office is inquiring into the matter and gathering information. Hence, it isn?t possible to state the outcome at the moment, but as we said in our letters to the President and the Prime Minister, according to preliminary investigations carried out by the Commission, the violence appears to have been instigated by external elements in an organized manner causing communal division, death and destruction of property. The Commission takes this issue very seriously.? ?
Q Do you think the Government is taking adequate action to identify who is responsible for the recent incidents of communal violence and make them accountable??
We have noted that many arrests have been made following these incidents, but we have to wait and see what action would be taken following that. We stated in our letters that not only those who participate in such violence, but also those who instigate violence and provide organizational strength have to be made accountable. Hence, we have to wait and see if that would be the case and whether there are prosecutions.??
Q Many have pointed fingers at law enforcement authorities for being inefficient. Has the HRC addressed this issue??
These are all issues that we?ll be looking into during our investigation into the violence. We hope to have it completed soon because it?s an issue of national importance.? ?
Q In the aftermath of the violence we saw efforts of solidarity being made by the Sinhalese and the Muslim communities. What should be done to prevent a recurrence of such violence??
Many things can be done. We need to acknowledge that intolerance and prejudice exist within our societies and they need to be addressed. Where we find communal harmony and good inter-ethnic relations we need to foster them. At the local level or the community level where there was positive action or where the communities banded together you found that the links between the different communities was quite strong, which led them to come together during a crisis. That definitely needs to be fostered and supported. And most importantly in order to prevent a recurrence we need to have accountability. It means you need to stem impunity and ensure there is respect for the rule of law. That is a key part of preventing recurrence.? ?
Q Spreading hatred and racism on social media is a longstanding issue. What existing laws can be used to bring those who spread racism and hatred on social media before justice??
Right now we have the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) Act, which applies to incitement of religious and racial violence. But where social media is concerned, I think it is also something that we need to understand better. We need research and dialogue on the issue and we need to consult experts. I think there is also a fear about social media, which sometimes happens with new technology, and it is thought that by clamping down on the medium you can stop certain acts. But social media is only a tool that is used to incite hatred or violence, it is not the cause of hatred or violence. While we think of how to manage the tool we must also address the root causes. Our policy and decision making must be evidenced based and data driven. We must make informed decisions based on evidence. As the HRC said in its letter to the Chairman of the TRC it is also important to ensure that a balance is struck and it does not impinge upon freedom of expression and the right to information and that it adheres to the Constitution and to our international human rights obligations.? ?
Q What kind of a social media policy can Sri Lanka adopt??
At present, a particular policy or framework cannot be recommended because any recommendation made has to be informed and supported by data or evidence. Currently, there is inadequate awareness of the manner in which social media platforms function and ways in which they can be accessed- for instance, as we know, even if you ban certain apps or social media platforms, you could use VPN- proxy servers- to access these apps or sites. Hence, it is important to obtain the advice of experts. This is an area we really need to consider, learn and research more about and ensure that any policy is evidenced based and data driven. I?ve talked to a few experts and what I have learned is that I need to learn more. For example, I have learned that it is possible without impinging on anyone?s right to privacy to map and to even predict violence that is about to unfold, based on the data available in the public domain. You can track who is saying what, how consistently they?re saying it etc. Hence, it is possible to have some sort of an early warning system. We must however always ensure that we take considered and well-informed decisions. Most importantly, as I said social media is just a tool. We must not get lost in talking about the tool and forget about the core issues and problems, and the root causes of this violence.? ?
Q In terms of transitional justice, the Government has been lagging behind the full implementation of the UN resolution. What are the implications of this delay?
Where transitional justice mechanisms are concerned the Commission has expressed its disappointment about the delays in establishing them. We are however pleased that the Office of Missing Persons has been established. In any context, the failure to address the grievances, loss and pain of and violations suffered by persons, would have an adverse impact on not only those affected, but on the society as a whole and on inter-community relations in particular when it concerns different ethnic/religious groups.? ?
Q The Government has decided to establish a reparation office. What is the purpose of a reparation office??
I can?t say anything specific about the Government?s proposed plans because the Commission is not aware of them. In Sri Lanka, we often equate compensation with reparation, whereas compensation is a part of reparation. Reparation has many elements, namely, restitution, compensation, rehabilitation, satisfaction and guarantees of non-repetition. So it?s not only about providing redress for a harm suffered, i.e. compensation for a destroyed house, but also recognizing the right to reparation and recognizing victims as equal citizens. Reparation programmes can include material, symbolic, individual and collective measures etc. So the purpose particularly in post-war countries is to assist people who have been affected by the war to rebuild their lives and return to a position in which they were before they experienced the violence, violations etc. In establishing a reparations programme it?s important to do so in a consultative manner with the participation of civil society and of affected persons.? ?
Q Is a new legislation required for the Office on Missing Persons (OMP)??
We currently have an institution called the Rehabilitation of Persons, Properties and Industries Authority (REPPIA) that has been providing compensation to people; including those affected by the armed conflict. But its remit is rather narrow and it doesn?t adopt a holistic view of reparation. Hence, in order to formulate a holistic reparations programme that adopts a broad definition of reparation in line with international standards you would need to have a new legislation.? ?
Q The OMP is operationalized now with the appointment of its members. How would the HRC assist the OMP??
Over the years the HRC has received a large number of complaints from families of the disappeared. We will liaise with the OMP to share information that we have with it and also provide any sort of assistance that it requires.? ?
Q A team of legal experts from Sri Lanka is to challenge the procedure adopted by the UNHRC to pass the resolution on Sri Lanka. What are the views of the HRC in relation to this??
This doesn?t particularly fall within our mandate. Our mandate applies only within the borders of Sri Lanka; we are also mandated to ensure that Sri Lanka adheres to its international legal obligations.? ?
Q Isn?t this UN resolution an international legal obligation as well??
Yes it is. But Sri Lankan citizens also have the right to engage in UN procedures and its mechanisms. As far as we are concerned we look into allegations of violations against the State within the borders of Sri Lanka and we are also mandated to ensure that Sri Lanka adheres to its international legal obligations. Any resolution that is accepted or conventions that are ratified by Sri Lanka are within our mandate. But the intervention you mentioned is about citizens who are engaging directly with the UN system and they have every right to do so.? ?
Q Activists have urged for the repeal of the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA) and in fact there were reports on a proposed counter terrorism Act. With regard to the repeal of the PTA what is the current situation??
As you know the Commission has repeatedly called for the repeal of the PTA as it allows for prolonged detention without judicial review and the admissibility of confessions made to a police officer of a certain rank etc. We have reiterated numerous times that any new legislation should be in line with international human rights standards and Sri Lanka?s international obligations. The Commission isn?t aware of the current status of the process to draft new law.? ?
Q It was reported that the HRC hasn?t received a reply to an RTI request made requesting a copy of the report on the Welikada prison riots within the time stipulated in the law. What do you think of the efficiency in which public authorities respond to RTI requests??
The RTI legislation is a very positive thing and it seems it has caught the public?s imagination because people are using the law to obtain information and also to bring about greater transparency. What we find is that the State structures are still unprepared to implement it effectively. This is due to many reasons. I think there is a lack of awareness of the law and the obligations it places on public officials and the lack of human resources in particular to implement it efficiently and effectively within the legally stipulated timeline. In Sri Lanka we aren?t particularly partial to proactive disclosure and I think there is still a reluctance to share information freely. We still see that reluctance even though we have the RTI Law, which points to the fact that legislation alone is inadequate to bring about social change. A change of work culture and mindset is also required. Proactive disclosure means to disclose everything possible unless you cannot for very serious reasons. If you look at the HRC, we have listed information we can share and that which we can?t disclose. However, even with regard to information we can?t disclose, we have stated that if we believe it is in the public interest then we will disclose such information. We are still unprepared and ill equipped to implement the law, which is a very positive law. It can be a tool, a weapon to bring about greater transparency, greater accountability and combat corruption.? ?
Q In your view is the HRC truly independent?
Absolutely. We have not had any political interference from anyone telling us what to do or what not to do, or try to influence our decisions in certain cases etc. Therefore, we can say we believe that we are truly independent.? ?
Q Do you think that the HRC should be vested with more power so that its decisions are binding??
That?s a question that is asked from us very regularly. We?ve discussed this within the Commission and we don?t believe that to be the case for many reasons. Firstly, if we are to issue enforceable orders we would become a quasi-judicial body. The whole point of establishing the HRC was to establish an alternative mechanism for people to seek redress because court procedures are expensive, time consuming etc. If we judicialize the HRC processes as well, then we make it more difficult for the complainants. Secondly, in Sri Lanka there have been instances when judicial orders, which are binding, are sometimes not adhered to. Giving an order does not guarantee that it will be implemented. It all comes back to respecting the rule of law, and how the citizens and public servants feel about the HRC and its role in the society.? ?
Globally, in most countries human rights commissions don?t have the power to issue enforceable orders. They issue recommendations. In many countries these recommendations are taken very seriously and implemented. Therefore, the question we need to ask ourselves is why is it not happening in our country? So the problem lies with us. Would the HRC issuing an order be taken as a solution? We don?t think so because as I stated above, regrettably, there have been instances when even court orders aren?t adhered to. So how do we solve this problem? It?s about lack of respect for the rule of law and lack of respect for the mandate and the role of the HRC. We believe that currently we do have quite adequate powers because we can summon people and documents and we can visit places of detention unannounced. At the end of the day it?s not about the Commission per se, it?s about how the community and State structures react and engage in our work. Does a penalty have to always exist in order for people to respect a finding or a recommendation of the Commission? If so what does it say about our society?? ?

Thilanga complains to Speaker over Navin?s ?unruly behaviour?
	
Deputy Speaker and Chairman of Committees, Thilanga Sumathipala today complained to Speaker Karu Jayasuriya that Plantation Industries Minister Navin Dissanayake had threatened him following the no-confidence vote against Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe in Parliament yesterday.
In a statement, he said Minister Dissanayake blasted at him in a rowdy manner near the elevator at the second floor.
?In front of police officers, Minister Dissanayake threatened to remove me from the post of Deputy Speaker. Several ministers who witnessed this incident mediated and tried to explain to the minister that his behaviour was indecent,? he said. ?
However, Minister Sumathipala had requested the Speaker to hold an impartial inquiry into this incident and take disciplinary measures accordingly.
When Daily Mirror contacted Minister Dissanayake to inquire into the incident, he refuted the allegations levelled by Minister Sumathipala about a bitter experience involving the duo. ?
?The Speaker has not approached me regarding such a complaint. If one needs any clarification on the issue, he or she may view the video footages recorded in CCTV cameras at the location where the incident is alleged to have taken place,? he said. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

We will hang on: Dilan
	
Not a single SLFP minister who voted in support of the No Faith Motion on Wednesday was ready to leave the ?Yahapalana Government? as they were appointed by President Mithripala Sirisena and not by any one else, Highways State Minister Dilan Perera said.
He added that the aftermath of the No Faith Motion has brought the country into a risky position as the motion was beaten with the help of the TNA and the SLMC by giving them various promises and assets.
Addressing the media at the SLFP head office today, Minister Perera said all SLFP members of the government including those who voted for and against the No Confidence Motion were united and on the same wavelength and determined to work against the UNP policies.
?Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne has said that all SLFPers would be ousted from the portfolios when the new cabinet is appointed. But it is the responsibility of the President Sirisena. Therefore, we remain in our posts until President ask us to leave,? he stressed.
Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara said all 16 members of the SLFP who supported the NFM would sit in the opposition in Parliament and added all 41 SLFP members were supportive of the NFM.
?Abstaining in Parliament at the time of vote taking does not mean that they opposed the motion. They did not support it either and that means they are with us,? Minister Jayasekara stressed.
Minister Jayasekara emphasized that the NFM was not against President Sirisena and it was against Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and the opposition for him as Prime minister by will remain as long as this Parliament expires.
Minister Chandima Weerakkody also addressed the news briefing. (Sandun A Jayasekera)
