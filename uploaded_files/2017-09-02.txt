AG to direct CID to launch criminal probe on PTL chief dealer
	
The Attorney General is to direct the CID to initiate a criminal investigation on a statement made by Perpetual Treasuries Ltd IT executive that its Chief Dealer Nuwan Salgado had instructed him to delete several sections from the its phone recording system.
The directive is expected to be forwarded to the CID by Monday.
The CID officials will record statements from those being investigated and take necessary action based on their investigations, which may lead to Mr. Salgado's arrest.
In a startling revelation on August 31, PTL IT executive Sachith Devathantri admitted to the PCoI that he had deleted several sections from PTL?s voice recording system on Mr. Salgado's instructions on July 5, 2017.
He also disclosed that the altered phone recordings were the ones provided to the PCoI in the latter part of last month contradicting what PTL?s CEO Kasun Palisena said in his affidavit earlier that they had provided all the data to the investigation.
In the wake of PTL IT executive?s testimony, Additional Solicitor Generals Dappula de Livera and Yasantha Kodagoda were of the view that PTL chief dealer had committed a serious offence under Criminal Procedure Code and the Penal Code, by fabricating evidence during the PCoI proceedings.
According to Section 24, ?Institution of Criminal Proceedings?, of the Commissions Inquiry Act, the Attorney General has the cognizance to take appropriate action when such criminal offence has been transpired towards the cause of justice.
However, the AG has no legal powers to direct the CID to arrest an individual according to the law. The AG will only direct the CID to commence a criminal investigation on the matter.
Justice Prasanna Jayawardena on an earlier occasion that the PCoI had the authority to issue such arrest orders according to law but only AG can direct to the CID to launch an investigation. (Shehan Chamika Silva)

## Title: Annual pilgrimage  of Islam

Annual pilgrimage  of Islam
	
What is Hajj and what takes place during the annual pilgrimage? Let us turn to an English scholar who inscribed the following epitaph in the late 19th century, when the British rule dominated over much of the world:?
?But above all - and herein is its supreme importance in the missionary history of Islam - it ordains a yearly gathering of believers, of all nations and languages, brought together from all parts of the world, to pray in that sacred place towards which their faces are set in every hour of private worship in their distant homes. No stretch of religious genius could have conceived a better expedient for impressing on the minds of the faithful a sense of their common life and of brotherhood in the bonds of faith.
Here, in a supreme act of common worship, the Negro of the West coast of Africa meets the Chinaman from the distant East; the courtly and polished Ottoman recognises his brother Muslim in the wild islander from the farthest end of the MalayanSea. At the same time throughout the whole Muhammedan world the hearts of believers are lifted up in sympathy with their more fortunate brethren gathered together in the sacred city, as in their own homes they celebrate the festival of ?Eed al-Ad-haa??? - T. W. Arnold, The Preaching of Islam, London, 1956, p. 415. ?
I am yet to find a more eloquent expression on Hajj even from a Muslim source than this by Sir Thomas Walker Arnold, who penned his observations in his book ?The Preaching of Islam,? in 1896 CE. Arnold, a prominent Indian civil servant, was awestruck by the rituals of Hajj. Any impartial observer would have felt the same at any given Hajj season be it in 1896, 1996 or even 796.?
The format and rituals of Hajj have remained virtually unchanged since its inception 15 centuries ago, the rituals that signify the universal brotherhood that are enjoined in Islam. The technology may have changed, modes of transport have never been more comfortable but a time-traveller from the Seventh Century would have found himself or herself at home in the Plains of Arafat in 2016 and in Mecca despite all that modernisation that has taken place in recent times.?
Schams Elwazer, a producer covering the event of Hajj for CNN in 2012 found herself in an identical situation to that of T.W. Arnold. Under the caption ?A Non-Pilgrim at the Hajj: A Memoir,? in her Blog she had this to say:?
?Sitting there on the white marble floor of the Grand Mosque, it was difficult not be blown away by the diversity of the people passing by. Groups of Indonesians in crisp white wearing colored headbands for identification and moving in tight phalanx formations quietly chanting the mantra of the Hajj (which translates approximately to ?Oh God, I have obeyed your call?). Groups of West Africans in colorful garb almost singing verses of Islam?s Holy Book the Quran. Old Chinese couples, groups of blonde Europeans and Americans; it felt as if we were literally watching the entire world walk past. The effect was nothing short of hypnotic.?(28.10.2012)?
It all began, or should I say the tradition established by our great Patriarch Abraham (A) was revived 15 centuries ago after a single commandment of God, ?And proclaim to the people the Hajj, they will come to you on foot and on every lean camel, they will come from every distant pass.? (Quran 22:27)?
The practical aspect of it was taught by Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) in his lifetime when he undertook the pilgrimage. He emphasised on equality of Humans in the presence of God, regardless of man-made social and economic barriers. This scenario is repeated year in and year out at Hajj, where in addition to promoting universal brotherhood of mankind, the spirit of sacrifice to achieve it also emboldened in the hearts and minds of pilgrims.?
The modern world is plagued with racism and intolerance which Islam prohibits in no uncertain terms. The Hajj is an ideal occasion to re-build lost grounds and revive the brotherhood and tolerance which are sanctified in Islam. In his final pilgrimage, Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) addressing a crowd of 100,000 people declared:?
?An Arab has no superiority over a non-Arab, nor a non-Arab has any superiority over an Arab; also a white has no superiority over black, nor a black has any superiority over white except by piety (taqwa) and good action.?
These words dispelled the myth that some races and classes of people are superior to others and established the fact that all humans are equal, for which Prophet Abraham (pbuh) struggled in his life. We are all equal human beings in the eyes of God. It is for this same noble cause Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) worked tirelessly during his lifetime. When he left this world at the age of 63, he had no worldly belongings. Instead of living a luxury life, he sacrificed all for the sake of humanity. His parting shot was to follow the Quran and his traditions and vowed if we abide by them we would never go astray. In his own words ?you will neither inflict nor suffer any inequity.??
Today?s Muslims are tested in various ways, latest being the fear-mongering by certain groups that they will be ruled under Shariah or Islamic law in Sri ?Lanka and they stand to lose their freedom. This is a baseless allegation, thus it is imperative for Muslims of Sri Lanka to clear this misunderstanding among non-Muslims. It is forbidden to force anything on others.?
Let it be known that under an ideal Islamic government, ?non-Muslims will have the same political and cultural rights as Muslims. They will have autonomy and freedom of religion.? This clause was enshrined in the Constitution of Medina, also known as the Charter of Medina under the instructions of Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) when it was drafted in the year 622 CE.?
Dr. John Andrew Morrow, the author of The Covenants of Prophet Muhammad (Angelico Press, 2013), commends this exemplary conduct of Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) and opined that under the Constitution of Medina:?
?Identity and loyalty were no longer to be based on family, tribe, kinship, or even religion: the overriding identity was membership in the ummah (nation) of Muhammad. The Constitution of Medina decreed that the citizens of the Islamic state were one and indivisible regardless of religion. Be they heathen, People of the Book, or Muslims, all those who were subject to the Constitution belonged to the same ummah (nation). In doing so, he created a tolerant, pluralistic government which protected religious freedom. The importance of this is so extraordinary that it is often misunderstood.?
This may come as a surprise to some, but it is the fact. Tolerance is important in Islam, and justice is equal to all as Andrew Murray stressed, ?Even Muhammad, the Messenger of Allah, was not above the law.??
Had Muslims taken a little effort to spread this message, we would not have seen the misunderstandings on Islam that are prevalent in our society today. On this blessed day, I urge my fellow Muslims to take this as a religious duty and make a sincere effort to clear the doubts that exist among non-Muslims, not only on this issue but on countless other issues.?
The events that T.W. Arnold observed will continue by the Grace of God, but what takes place in Mecca should trickle down in to our daily lives and the same should be reflected in the Muslim world at large. It is only then one could proclaim it has been a success. This is the true spirit of Hajj.?
While celebrating the Hajj festivities, Eid ul Adha, let us pray for forgiveness, peace and prosperity of Mother Lanka and peace and prosperity of the world.?
?Former Minister of Muslim Religious and Cultural Affairs and Parliamentary Affairs ??

All National Identity cards were being issued from yesterday with front-facing images prior to converting them to Electronic Identity (E-ID) Cards, Commissioner General of the Department for Registration of Persons (DRP), Viyani Gunathilaka said.
He said the department would issue the ?Smart IDs? from next month and this step was initiated because of several concerns and complications over the National Identity Cards now in circulation.
However, the photos for Smart IDs, which would be issued from October onward, will be engraved on special polycarbonate plastic using laser technology. They will be made according to international standards and by using a special software provided by the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO)
?The department has decided to launch a new registry for Sri Lankans by the end of next year. After collecting data, the department will issue E-ID Cards by the end of 2018 or beginning of 2019. (Chaturanga Pradeep)

Hajj - The fifth pillar
	
?
?
?Labbaika! Allahumma Labbaika, La Sharikalaka! Innal Hamda Wan Ne?mata Lak Wal Mulk La Sharieka Lak? (I stand up for Thy service, O Allah I stand up! There is no partner with Thee! I stand up! Verily Thine is the praise, the blessing and the kingdom! There is no partner with Thee).
This is how the pilgrims glorify the creator, Allah Subhana Watala, when approaching the holy Ka?baa for the first time in their life. At this, Almighty Allah remarks to the angels: ?Look at my servants, they have come towards me disheveled and scattered while their bodies and clothes are covered with the dust of long journeys. Oh My Angels, I take you to witness that I have forgiven their sins.? ??
The angels will say: ?O Allah, among them there is that evil man ... At this, Allah will reply: ?I have forgiven them all.? How fortunate the Hajjis are to get huge rewards for their good deeds from the benevolent Creator, Allah Almighty. ??
Pilgrims undertake pilgrimage to Mecca to perform Hajj barely two months after purifying oneself from the worldly desires and unhealthy habits by fulfilling the obligatory fasting as Allah Almighty has commanded in the Holy Quran: ?Pilgrimage to the House of Allah is a duty man owes to Allah - upon those who can afford the journey.? When Hajjis set out in the path of Allah, they are reminded that they prepare themselves for peaceful exit from the world. ??
To perform Hajj, Hajjis leave behind their property, intimate friends, relations, kith and kin and also their much cherished motherland for a brief period. Pilgrims realise there will come a time to leave everything mentioned above forever. An everlasting preparation one makes in this world before death is by doing good deeds in complete adherence to the laws of Allah, as clearly narrated in the Holy Quran and in the ways shown by the Holy Prophet (peace be upon him). ??
After reaching the Holy city, it is most heartening to see the plain desert of Mecca, in the midst, the Holy Ka?baa where pilgrims make Tawaf (circuits) seven times reciting ?O Allah! I beg of thee forgiveness and peace in the world and the next. O, Lord, give us good in this world and good in the hereafter and save us from the torment of the fire.? ??
The noteworthy feature in Hajj is pilgrims all wearing the same, simple and plain white unsewn clothing and living in the same manner. The white cloth the Hajjis wear is unique in the sense that it does not differentiate between kings and laymen, the powerful and the weak and all wearing white and stand equal. ??
The distinctions of rank and colour, wealth and nationality disappear. The whole humanity that converges in thousands assumes one aspect and one attitude before the Master. The true love of Allah here becomes the reality and the Hajjis are imbued with immense love of the Supreme Being. Hajj leaves a deep and everlasting impact upon one who performs it. ??
Most of the religious rites pilgrims perform were that of Prophet Ibrahim, his wife Hajarah and their son Ismail (peace be upon them all). It creates on the faithful a tremendous impression how a family at the time of trial and turbulence to be united sincerely and faithfully in obeying the Lord of the Universe, ?Rabbil Alameen.? ??
To honour the Prophet Ibrahim (pbuh) and his family till the dooms day, Almighty Allah has commanded the Hajjis to exercise their virtuous acts like running seven times between the hillocks known as Al-Safa and Al-Marwa. ??
Hajarah (peace be upon her) was running in search of water in the barren desert to quench the thirst of her baby Ismail. She was astonished to see a spring bubbling from where her baby had been kicking his heels and today every pilgrim from this miraculous well of Zam Zam drink, bathe, launder their Ihram clothes, and further the holy water is stored in millions of gallons to be fetched home. ??
Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) has reported to have said Zam Zam is a cure for all diseases. This famous well of Zam Zam, rebuilt sometime ago with several pipelines sprouting out, provided water for the millions of Hajjis from the time of Prophet Ibrahim (pbuh) to the last five thousand years without receding, thus proving Almighty Allah?s supreme power over his creations. ??
Hajjis soon after leaving Mecca, their anxious moment was to go to Medina, the city of the Prophet Muhammad (pbuh). ??
According to Anas (May Allah be pleased with him), the Prophet said, ?O Allah, bestow in Medina twice the blessings you bestow on Mecca.? Once the Hajjis reached the entrance of Medina, the green dome of the Prophet?s Masjid comes into sight where the auspicious body of Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) with his erstwhile colleagues Abu Bakr Siddique and Umar Farook Ralliallahunhum was laid to rest. ??
Hazrath Ibnu Umar (May Allah be pleased with him) narrates that the Prophet said, ?The Holy Grave is like one has visited me while I am alive (Mishkat).? Hajjis spend more than eight days in the prophet?s town and are opportune to visit various historic sites and pray for those souls whose sacrifices 1,433 years ago made us to mould our lives according to the teachings of Islam. ??
While Muslims in Sri Lanka and rest of the world celebrate the Hajj festival as usual, in Mecca, Sri Lankan Hajjis will be busy along with Hajjis worldwide fulfilling Hajj rites in places like Mina, Arafat and Muzdalifa. ??
On the ninth day of Zul-Haj at Arafat, pilgrims make supplication (dua), recite the Holy Quran, engage in Zikr, deliver sermons and earnestly seek the blessings of Allah and his forgiveness, and staying at Arafath from Luhar to Mahrib is the core of the Haj. Like last year this time too, Sri Lankan pilgrims will devote more time for supplication to bestow much needed peace and happiness to our motherland in the House of Allah, Ka?baa.
It is most heartening and appropriate to recall Prophet Muhammad?s (pbuh) first and last Hajj was performed on Hijri 10. His hajj was known as ?Hajjathul Wida? or farewell Hajj. ??
One hundred and twenty four thousand companions of Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) joined the Hajj. On the 9th day of Arafat, the verse announcing the completion of the religion of Islam was revealed to Prophet Muhammad (pbuh). ?This day I perfected your religion for you, completed my favour upon you, and have chosen for you Islam as your religion? (5-4).
At the Mount Arafat, Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) made the farewell sermon. Companions who were present at that sermon began to carry the message - the light of Islam to every nook and corner of the world. We learn from the above that it is a duty of every Hajji who depart from Arafat to take some share in practicing and propagating the teachings of Islam in their environments which alone can bring peace and salvation to the entire world. ??

Iraq faces vast challenges despite victories over IS
	
?
DAILY MAIL, 1 September, 2017-Iraq?s victory over the Islamic State group in Tal Afar was the latest in a string of gains against the jihadist group, but Iraqi forces still face massive challenges, experts say. ??
In 2014, IS staged a rapid advance across northern Iraq, with police and military personnel abandoning their posts to the jihadists with barely a fight. ??
That allowed IS to seize nearly a third of the country?s territory including Mosul, which was fully recaptured by Iraqi forces in July, three years after IS declared its self-styled ?caliphate? from a mosque in Iraq?s second city. ??
Today, Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi, who took office three months after the 2014 military debacle, says the Iraqi state is back -- stronger and better organised. ??
On Thursday, Abadi announced the recapture of the town of Tal Afar and surrounding areas, bringing the whole of Nineveh province of which Mosul is the capital under government control. ?

Modi?s $87 billion river-linking gamble set to take off as floods hit India
	
DAILY MAIL, 1 September, 2017-After years of foot-dragging India will begin work in around a month on an $87 billion scheme to connect some of the country?s biggest rivers, government sources say, as Prime Minister Narendra Modi bets on the ambitious project to end deadly floods and droughts. ??
The mammoth plan entails linking nearly 60 rivers, including the mighty Ganges, which the government hopes will cut farmers? dependence on fickle monsoon rains by bringing millions of hectares of cultivatable land under irrigation. ??
In recent weeks, some parts of India and neighbouring Bangladesh and Nepal have been hit by the worst monsoon floods in years. ? ?Modi has personally pushed through clearances for the first phase of the project - which would also generate thousands of megawatts of electricity. ??
That will involve construction of a dam on the Ken river, also known as the Karnavati, in north-central India and a 22-km (14-mile) canal connecting it to the shallow Betwa.

Muslim contribution to Sri Lankan culture
	
?
Little is it known that Sri Lanka?s Muslims have made a big contribution to Sri Lanka?s cultural life. They significantly influenced local culture in matters of food, dress, jewellery and pastimes, testifying to the close relations that existed between Muslims and other communities of the island, especially the Sinhalese and Tamils.
Sri Lankan Moors, descendants of Arab merchants who espoused local women, contributed in no mean measure to the island?s culinary culture, attire and ornamentation while their Malay co-religionists, whose ancestors hailed from Indonesia contributed not only to local cuisine, but also succeeded in introducing a couple of popular national pastimes.
?
Food Items
The Arabs and their Moor descendants have made a small, yet significant contribution to Sinhalese society in matters of food. The aluva, a class of popular confections, have their origins in the Arabic halwa ?sweet? suggesting that it was the Arabs who introduced this sweetmeat. This item has been in existence among the Sinhalese for some time. Robert Knox in his Historical Relation of Ceylon (1681) gives alloways as flat sweetmeats in the fashion of a lozenge showing that they were in existence among the Kandyan Sinhalese of his day. A popular beverage sold in Sinhalese wayside booths to this day is saruvat, which is prepared with the juices of various fruits. This drink has its origins in the Arabic sharbat ?drink?. Benjamin Clough in his Sinhalese-English Dictionary (1892) gives saruvat as ?sherbet? showing that it had been known among the Sinhalese for quite some time and may go back several centuries.
Among Muslim introductions to popular food culture may be mentioned the buriyani, a rich rice dish made of fine-grained basmati rice and a copious quantity of mutton or chicken cooked in ghee. Indeed so popular has this meal become that even the local chain of Kentucky Fried Chicken now offers it as part of its regular menu. The same holds true of the dessert known as Vattilappam which is made of eggs, kitul jaggery and spices, which is fast gaining popularity among other communities, so much so that cups of it are now being produced commercially for local consumption. This delectable pudding is perhaps best described by J.P De Fonseka (A Gourmet?s Guide to Ceylon. Times of Ceylon Christmas Number, 1937) who wrote about it nearly eighty years ago as follows: ?The Muslim?s is a sweet tooth. He has a pudding (for which Allah be praised) called wattiliappam, a soft, succulent one of jaggery and eggs and all the spices of the earth, which goes down with a demure sweetness like that of the hour is in paradise?.
?
?
The Malays also made a small but important contribution to Sinhalese society by way of pastimes. One such is the rabana, a large circular drum played by women during the Sinhala New Year
The Arabs and their Moor descendants have made a small, yet significant contribution to Sinhalese society in matters of food.?
Luxurious lace work known in Sinhala as kasav ?gold lace?, ?gold fringe? also seem to have been introduced by Muslims since the very term derives from Arabic qasab ?fringe or lace of a garment?.
?
?
Relishes and pickles
The Malays too have contributed their share to local culinary fare. One such notable contribution is the Sambola, a preparation of grated coconut, onions, chillies, lime juice and salt very often consumed as a relish in Sinhalese homes. This dish could be traced back to the Malay sambal. Another Malay contribution to Sinhalese fare is the pickle known as achcharu made of fruits such as mango, hog plum and wild olive which has its origins in the Malay achar. Among the sweets of Malay origin that still figure in Sinhalese festivities is the bibikkan, a baked brownish cake made of flour, desiccated coconut, sugar and chopped cashew nuts, which has originated from the Malay bikang ?rice flour cake?. Dodol, an oily, dark-brownish sweetmeat made of rice flour, coconut milk and sugar, jaggery or treacle widely prepared in Sinhalese homes likewise has its origins in the Malay sweetmeat of the same name. Another Sinhalese item of Malay origin, though hardly if ever made nowadays is the sinakku which has its origins in the Malay Cheena-kuve ?Chinese Cake?, apparently because they were prepared in little cups or bowls of Chinese origin.
Among other Muslim groups that have contributed to local culinary fare are the Bohras, who were instrumental in introducing a well known item known as godamba rotti, a sort of thin bread made with wheat flour, which is commonly made in local eating houses.?
J.P Fonseka in his Gourmet?s Guide to Ceylon tells us that ?Borahs specialise in godumba roti, a creation of eggs and flour? suggesting that this item was introduced by this group of people. A further embellishment of the godamba rotti is seen in what came to be known as kottu rotti prepared by mixing chopped godamba rotti with a rich mix of vegetables, meat and eggs. This dish too was invented by local Muslims, for commercial purposes to be served in their eating houses. It has today become a very national dish transcending ethnic barriers and has even had Sinhala songs dedicated to it. Such is its popularity.
?
Sweetmeats
The popular local candy floss known as Bombay Muttai ?Bombay Sweet? was introduced by Indian Muslims known as Moplas. This is supported by Fonseka?s 1930s reference to Bombay Muttai
?That gossamer-like creation looking like the venerable beard of a holy patriarch? being in the hands of the Coast or Indian Moors who resorted here for trade. Tudor Jones (These people make Ceylon. Times of Ceylon Christmas Number 1935) is more specific, telling us that the Moplahs (a type of Indian Moor) go about the streets carrying round tin boxes on their heads. ?In the boxes they carry Bombay muttai for the Moplahs have a monopoly in this?.
Another item which seems to have its origins in the Moplahs or at any rate the Coast Moors is what is popularly known locally as Muscat, an oily sweetmeat made of clarified butter, wheat flour, sugar and cashew nuts and coloured red, green or yellow.?
Fonseka mentions in his 1930s account of the fare of the different peoples of his day the muscat of the Coast Moors, who being a mercantile community traded in this commodity and possibly produced it. The item takes its name from the capital of Oman Muscat where this sweet seems to have been produced in large quantities. Andrew Crichton (History of Arabia.1833) refers to the people of Muscat preparing ?an esteemed sweetmeat, named hulwah, from honey or sugar, with the gluten of wheat, and ghee, and a few almonds?.
?
Articles of Dress
Among the articles of dress introduced by Moor merchants to Sinhalese society may be mentioned the headgear worn by Kandyan men in the olden days. Robert Knox in his Historical Relation of Ceylon (1681) refers to the Kandyan Sinhalese wearing caps as a habit. Even temple paintings of the time of King Kirti Sri Rajasinha (1747-1782) represent chiefs wearing white caps. This fashion could have arisen as a result of the influence of Muslim merchants,
It is also possible that Muslim traders introduced the moappili, a shawl used to cover the head and the upper part of the body, which figured prominently in the attire of Kandyan women at one time, especially in the days of King Rajadhi Rajasinha (1782-1798) and after as is borne out by temple paintings in Degaldoru and Mulgirigala among others.?
Luxurious lace work known in Sinhala as kasav ?gold lace?, ?gold fringe? also seem to have been introduced by Muslims since the very term derives from Arabic qasab ?fringe or lace of a garment?.
The Malays too contributed significantly to local attire. Among these is the sarong, the traditional lower garment of local Sinhalese and Tamil men which differs from the dhoti of India in being a tubular lower garment worn from the waist downwards. The Sinhala term for the garment sarama as well as the local Tamil term for it saram have originated from the Malay sarung or sarong. Likewise, the Sinhala term for ear-studs karabu has its origins in the Malay kerabu showing that it was the Malays of old who introduced this class of ornaments.
?
Nose Rings
Although the Muslim cultural contribution to local Tamil society has not been very significant, the introduction of nose ornaments is notable. No ornament on the face of the earth enhances a woman?s allure so much as a nose ring or stud. As such this is a very important contribution of Muslims to feminine culture. As shown by Dr. A.S. Altekar in his Position of Women in Hindu Civilisation (1938), nose ornaments were unknown in India throughout the entire Hindu period and was clearly borrowed from the Muslims. In fact, nose ornaments are attested amongst Muslim peoples, especially Arabs, for several centuries. For instance, Sir Richard Burton in his Narrative of a Pilgrimage to Al-Madinah and Meccah (1893) refers to the Bedouin women of Arabia wearing nose-rings. Especially interesting in the local context is a horde of jewellery excavated in Anuradhapura in the 1940s which included a lady?s nose ornaments in association with a necklace with gold coins in Arabic characters struck in the name of a tenth century Abbasid Caliph of Baghdad (Report on the Archaeological Survey of Ceylon for 1946. Senarat Paranavitana. 1948).
Yoga Vallipuram (Traditionally Yours. Times of Ceylon Annual 1964) tells us that the mookuthi or nose stud in shapes like crescent moon or star was once considered an essential ornament for married Tamil women.?
?Today? she says ?only girls brought up in orthodox families have their noses pierced for these studs?. She adds: ?But if today?s bride does not wear the mookuthi, she certainly does the tiny droplet called pullakku which hangs from the end of her nose, just above her lip?. Vallipuram?s reference to the pulakku or nose-pendant is interesting as both the name and form of the ornament suggests an Arab origin. Captain F.M.Hunter (An Account of the British Settlement of Aden in Arabia. 1877) refers to the Bulakh which Arab women wear as ?a flat gold crescent, chased and stamped, studded with pearls, having a fringe of pearls on the outside; it is worn suspended from the central membrane of the nose by a semicircular wire which joins the horns of the crescent?. Thus it can easily be deduced that the pulakku worn by local Tamil women had its origins in the bulakh of Arabian women, especially since we know that the Tamil language turns an initial ?b? into a ?p? when borrowing from foreign languages.
?
Popular Pastimes
The Malays also made a small but important contribution to Sinhalese society by way of pastimes. One such is the rabana, a large circular drum played by women during the Sinhala New Year to the accompaniment of songs known as raban pada. This item has its origins in the Malay rebana, especially the type known as rebana ubi. The Malay term itself seems to derive from the Arabic rabbana ?Our Lord?, which figures prominently in Islamic devotional music sung to the accompaniment of the drum.
The popular pastime of kite flying also seems to have been introduced by the Malays. The Sinhala term for ?kite? sarungalaya seems to be connected to the Sundanese sarenkol ?a small tubed bamboo, crooked at every joint, diverging at some angle from the preceding one? or sarang ?cross laths of split bamboo?, it being understood that bamboo is ideal for making kite frames.?
This is supported by an observation made by Louis Nell in his Explanatory List of Portuguese Words adopted by the Sinhalese published in The Orientalist over a century ago. He refers to the word gaviam meaning sparrow hawk applied by the Sinhalese of his day to hawk-shaped paper kites for flying, some with an Aeolian contrivance in a vibrating thin ribband of bamboo reed stretched to a bow and emitting a strong sound in a high wind. This, he says, used to be prepared by the Malay population.?
This article is based on a presentation made by the writer on the occasion of the launch of the Movement to Promote and Strengthen Sri Lankan Muslim Identity organised by the Muslim Women?s Research and Action Forum and?

DAILY MAIL, 1 September, 2017-Nearly 400 people have died in fighting that has rocked Myanmar?s northwest for a week, new official data show, making it probably the deadliest bout of violence to engulf the country?s Rohingya Muslim minority in decades. ??
Around 27,400 Rohingya have crossed into Bangladesh from Myanmar, United Nations sources said, a week after Rohingya insurgents attacked police posts and an army base in Rakhine state, prompting clashes and a military counter offensive. ??
The army says it is conducting clearance operations against ?extremist terrorists? and security forces have been told to protect civilians. But Rohingya fleeing to Bangladesh say a campaign of arson and killings aims to force them out.The clashes and ensuing army crackdown have killed about 370 Rohingya insurgents, but also 13 security forces, two government officials and 14 civilians, the Myanmar military said on Thursday. ??
Myanmar evacuated more than 11,700 ?ethnic residents? from the area affected by fighting, the army said, referring to the non-Muslim population of northern Rakhine.

PC elections put off to enable electoral experiments: PM
	
The government will have to postpone the provincial council elections by one year to enable electoral experiments, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said yesterday.
He said this at the distribution of certificates by State Minister Sujeewa Senasinghe in Malabe to women trained under the ?Diriya Kathun? programme.
?We have started experimenting with the 25 per cent women representation in local bodies. Each party will have to do it and rectify shortcomings if there are any. It will be then extended to the provincial council level. This is why we have to postpone provincial council by a year,? the Premier said.
He said the opportunity to experiment with new electoral systems was lost during the past ten years.
?Government is focusing on involving more women in politics. Only a few women get involved in politics today. It is same with the youth. I had to push people like Mr Senasinghe in to politics. They were reluctant to take up politics as a result of the manapa system. However today we have introduced a mixed system at the local government level. Those who obtain small percentages of votes will now have the opportunity to come into local bodies,? the Prime Minister said.
He stressed the need for a national government to revive the economy which was being done gradually by bringing in foreign investors while encouraging local investors.
The Prime Minister said the government would launch a three-year development programme with the participation of President Maithripala Sirisena on Monday.
?We are focusing on women when it comes to economic development. Women are in several sectors in the economy. Economy is virtually run by women. Women involvement has to be increased. Women account for 35 per cent of the country?s workforce. Government?s target is to increase it to 40 per cent. Minister Senasinghe is engaged in a woman?s empowerment programme and is training them to become entrepreneurs in the apparel industry. This is a lucrative business. Both young men and women prefer tailor made clothes rather than purchase them from the market. It is same worldwide. There are others who prefer branded clothes. If I come here in five year?s time some of these women would have become entrepreneurs and also some of them may do their sewing using computers considering the technological development. Time will come when it will be possible to download patterns from the mobile phones,? he said.
The Prime Minister said a new thousand acre industrial zone in Horana was to be launched by a Thai company and the government had agreed to release 400 acres initially. He said Avissawella will also have an industrial zone and that discussions were underway with some Indian companies to set up another industrial zone in Weligama. ?These are parts of a vast development programme and Minister Senasinghe will play a prominent role in it,? he said.

Rescuers at Indian building collapse find 15 injured, 33 dead
	
?
DAILY MAIL, 1 September, 2017 ? - Rescuers worked through the night removing the rubble of a collapsed apartment building in India?s financial capital of Mumbai where at least 33 people have died and nearly a dozen others may still be buried. ??
Fire officer Prabhat Kumar said Friday that 15 injured survivors have been pulled from the debris so far.
??
Police said 33 bodies had been recovered from the rubble by early Friday, but hope was fading of finding anyone alive more than 24 hours after the building collapsed. Police say nearly a dozen people are missing and feared trapped beneath the huge mound of broken concrete slabs and twisted steel girders.Rescuers used earth-moving machines to lift concrete slabs and cement blocks as they searched for survivors. ??
The building had housed nine families in apartments above a first-floor nursery school, but the collapse Thursday morning occurred before the toddlers had arrived for the day, police said. ??

Rescuers in Texas intensify efforts as Harvey moves inland
	
?
Emergency workers in storm-hit southeast Texas on Thursday staged dramatic rescues by air and water in towns that were until now cut off by raging floodwaters unleashed by monster storm Harvey, which finally started to move inland. ??
Nearly a week after the storm smashed into the US Gulf Coast as a Category Four hurricane, thousands of rescuers and civilians eager to help battled difficult conditions to reach victims of the unprecedented flooding. ??
??We felt we?d be alright. We were wrong,? said Lonnie Givens, who refused to evacuate their one-storey home in the town of Orange. Now, he and wife Missy have about four inches (10 centimeters) of water in the house and no power. ??
The story told by Givens held for many others in Texas towns inundated by days of torrential rains, with highways still submerged and homes destroyed. ??
A hospital in the hard-hit town of Beaumont was forced to evacuate its patients -- nearly 200 people -- when the town?s water supply went down. ? ??
Speaking from the coastal city of Corpus Christi US Vice President Mike Pence hailed rescuers and volunteers for their ?compassion and concern.? ?Every American should know that even in this difficult time and this disastrous storm, the very best are the people of Texas, and the very best are the people of America shining forth,? he said. ?

SAITM issue: Carlo vows to topple govt.
	
"If the struggle against the SAITM continues in the same manner, the only option left is to topple the government. I have decided to commit my last phase of life to win this battle", former Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) chairman Prof. Carlo Fonseka said yesterday.
He said that he had confidentially referred a letter to former president Mahinda Rajapaksa when he was in power forewarning the current crisis over South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM).
Speaking to the media outside the Welikada Prison after visitng Medical Faculty Students' Action Committee Convener Ryan Jayalath who is currently in remand custody, Prof. Fonseka said he had referred this letter to former president Rajapaksa after he was appointed SLMC chairman in 2012.
?The SAITM which was established in 2009, later changed its name for ?medicine? from ?management?. At that time, I felt that the SAITM would negatively affect the health sector of the country. Therefore, I referred a confidential letter to Mr. Rajapaksa,? he added.
He said that Mr. Rajapaksa upon receiving the letter, had directed the issue to former higher education minister S.B. Dissanayake and had directed Prof. Fonseka to monitor its proceedings. He also said that Mr. Rajapaksa had then reacted in a justifiable manner to the letter sent by him.
He said that he had taken every possible step to avoid the functioning of the SAITM in this manner since the beginning and added that he was never afraid of Mr. Rajapaksa during the period of former government; ?Mr. Rajapaska has dealt with me in a kind manner. He would never go against any decisions of mine,? he added.? (Kalathma Jayawardhane)

SF released me from military ops: Jayasuriya
	
Former Sri Lankan Ambassador to Brazil, General (Retd.) Jagath Jayasuriya yesterday rejected the war crimes allegations levelled against him and said the then Army Commander General Sarath Fonseka in a written document had exempted him from responsibilities of all military operations.
Speaking exclusively to Daily Mirror he said: ?After all, General Fonseka was known to declare that it was he who did ?everything? to bring the war to an end.?
?I have the official document sent by Army Commander Fonseka during the latter part of the war, saying I have no responsibility for military operations,? he said.
Q: Why did you seek a change of career from military to diplomacy and did you actually ?flee? Brazil as reported by the foreign media amid war crime law suits?
A: I was selected as the Ambassador to Brazil at the end of my tenure as the Chief of Defence Staff. I took up the post and assumed duties in August 2015 for a term of two years. You don?t find many Sri Lankans in Brazil but the embassy with its staff did several projects to promote Sri Lanka in South America. We were able to hold the first ever Vesak Festival in Brazil with the support of other Asian countries. In June, this year I wrote to the then Foreign Secretary Esala Weerakoon saying that my tenure has been completed and if I?m being re-appointed as an Ambassador, I requested for that appointment be made to an Asian Country. On July 10, I received a reply saying the completion of the tenure has been approved and asked me to return before August 31. On August 7, I shipped my luggage and departed on the 27 from Brasilia. I Arrived in Sri Lanka on August 29 via S?o Paulo and Dubai.
Q: Were you aware of the ?lawsuit? filed against you before you left Brazil and why you think they had waited till the end of your tenure to make allegations?
A: I was not aware of the lawsuit. It only upon my arrival in Sri Lanka that I got to know about the news when charg? d'affaires of our embassy contacted me in the morning of August 29. He said media personnel are contacting the embassy to get a comment on this matter. Also, no one has filed a lawsuit in a court as reported by the media. The lawyer who had prepared the document had simply handed it over to the Federal Police of Brazil. In the document, they have requested the police to launch an investigation against the Sri Lankan Ambassador, to deprive diplomatic immunity of the Ambassador and to declare him a 'persona non grata' in the event the Sri Lankan government refused to cooperate with a probe.
The timing of the allegations is also questionable. Why wait till my tenure ended? They could have easily prepared this when I was still the Ambassador. I have questions as this could be an attempt to sling mud at me personally, to deprive me of a further appointment as an ambassador or based on some other hidden agenda.
Q: What do you have to say about the allegations levelled by the International Project of Truth and Justice (IPTJ) headed by Yasmin Sooka against you in connection with the torture that taken place at the Joseph Camp in Vavuniya?
A: Neither Sooka nor anyone else came there. All these allegations are those they bring up time to time changing the name of a person. This time they have levelled the same set of charges against me. Earlier, Kamal Gunaratne and Shanvendra Silva were targeted. There is no authenticity or any basis for these charges which are being made for the survival of some elements.
Q: Earlier this week, Justice Minister Thalatha Athukorale said she would take measures at a government level to remove any international or foreign barriers against you. Has she approached you?
A: If she has said so, it should be appreciated. Foreign travelling is something which would be affected by these allegations. Once, I had to move my transit point from Miami, US to Canada as I was not given clearance even for transit via the US when returning from Brazil. My wife was cleared for transit but not me. My daughter is in Australia and my son is in Hong Kong. The way some media reported the incident had affected them as well. I have to visit them from time to time. Embassies are reluctant to issue a visa even when there are mere allegations even without any basis. This is something I?m really concerned about.
Q: Would you be taking up the issue with the Government especially the Foreign Affairs Ministry?
A: Yes. I already have an appointment with Foreign Ministry Secretary Prasad Kariyawasam on Monday to handover official documents of ending my tenure as the Ambassador. I will raise this issue as well. I also spoke to the President?s Secretary and sought a meeting with President Maithripala Sirisena.
Q: Are you satisfied with the measures being taken by the government to address war crimes allegations being levelled against the military occasionally?
A: No. I?m not satisfied with the action taken by the government so far. It should settle this issue before any other matter and settle this once and for all. It has been eight years since the end of the war but still baseless allegations, the same set of allegations, keep surfacing from time to time. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

## Title: Tracing the footsteps of Prophet Abraham

Tracing the footsteps of Prophet Abraham
	
This beautiful journey through time is called ?Hajj,? an important pillar in the Islamic belief. Every able Muslim who has the finances after attending to family obligations is required to embark on this pilgrimage.?
Connecting the past with the present, rituals unfold the tale of the forefather of Abrahamic faiths: Jews, Christians and Muslims; Prophet Ibrahim (peace be upon him), Abraham in the Bible.?
This once-in-a-lifetime pilgrimage traces back the footsteps of Prophet Muhammad (pbuh), the last and final Messenger of God, and to relive the moments of Prophet Abraham (pbuh) and his sons Ishmael and Isaac from whose lineage comes all prophets (peace be upon them all) who brought the message of ?Monotheism? or ?Oneness of God.??
Hajj pilgrimage is the largest gathering in the world, uniting different nations into one Muslim brotherhood. The simple white cloth worn by the pilgrims erases class, race, culture and different backgrounds, thereby bringing together the rich as well as the poor into one worship. This portrays everyone is equal before Allah Almighty except those who excel in piousness and good deeds. This state of mind also reminds the pilgrims the simplicity of how they were born and how they would die, in a simple piece of white clothing irrespective of the material things they seek in this world. ? ?The first ritual is circumambulating the cube-shaped structure, the Ka?baa, built by Prophet Ibrahim (pbuh) and his son Ishmael. Seeing the Ka?baa before one?s eyes surely brings tears. Some cry hysterically after witnessing the object in the direction to which the Muslims pray five times a day until their death, from dawn to night, without seeing it and now standing right in front of it. ??
The Ka?baa is neither an object of worship nor are there any relics within it; it is simply empty. When Muslims worldwide perform ?Salaath? or the daily five times prayer, not only do they face the direction of the Ka?baa, but connects with each other along an invisible line from every corner of earth to the spiritual center of Islam. Whether a Muslim prays alone or as recommended in congregation, this common center links every worshiper who bows down to the one God, the Creator of humanity.
During this beautiful pilgrimage, Muslims recollect the supreme sacrifices made by Prophet Ibrahim (pbuh) for the sake of his creator whom the Muslims call Allah Almighty just the way previous prophets called him in all Sematic languages used in the Middle East where all prophets (peace be upon all) lived.?
Prophet Ibrahim (pbuh) faced extreme trials and his family?s faith was tested by God?s commands, but his sincere submission and devotion to the creator, to the will of ?Allah Almighty, ?taught mankind a spiritual lesson; a lesson to people of faith who will come till the end of time. His unshaken spirit of faith in the relationship with God shows man the enormous inborn strengths he bestowed upon him to strive and struggle in the face of difficulties ultimately which will lead to a path straight and clear to his maker to whom he would one day return. ?
In the command of Allah to take his wife Hajarah (peace be upon her) and his son Ishmael (pbuh) to a dry and arid land, the valley of Bekkah thousands of years ago, little did he dream this blessed land would turn to be home to all the prophets whom God Almighty sent through his lineage.
Pilgrims also trace the footsteps of Hajarah (peace be upon her) who ran between two hills in search of water for her baby who was dying of thirst in the scorching sun. God in his last and final testament states he brought forth a spring for her and the baby for the utmost dedication of her husband towards his maker. This spring, to date, gives water to millions of people and is called ?Zam Zam.? This water is universally accepted that it has amazing curative powers.?
German Scientist Dr. Knut Pfeiffer said Zam Zam water dramatically increases energy fields in human cells. The faith of the family of Ibrahim (pbuh) was again tested so greatly by the command of God to sacrifice his beloved son Ishmael (pbuh). Though overcome with extreme grief, both the father and son complied with the will of God. The extent of that supreme sacrifice to forgo the most loving worldly possession for the sake of Allah Almighty was replaced by God in the commandment to sacrifice a lamb instead (Qur?an 37; 102-110).
On the final day of the pilgrimage, all pilgrims head towards mount Arafah, the mount of blessings. This mount is the place where the last and final Messenger of God Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) delivered his last sermon. Fasting is highly recommended for non-pilgrims on Arafah, the day before Haj.?
?This day I have perfected you your religion, and completed my favour upon you, and approved for you Islam as your religion.? This verse was revealed by Allah Almighty on the day of Arafah to Prophet Muhammad (pbuh). Upon reading this verse in the Quran, the final testament ?to mankind, a Jewish man told Umar ibn Khattab ?if this verse was revealed to the Jews we would celebrate this day.?
Ibrahim (pbuh) and his family is remembered, honoured and celebrated for their utmost sincere submission to their Creator. The generations after him till the end of time would witness and honour his supreme sacrifice in the face of hardship, solely for the sake of God Almighty. In it we see the grand plan of God for those who submit to his will.?

University Teachers Group wants Public Commission on Education Reforms
	
Say support the call to end the MBBS programme at SAITM
?
As academics and activists, we are concerned about the Government?s plans for reform in the education sector.?
The report of the Subcommittee on Higher Education of the Sectoral Oversight Committee on Education and Human Resources Development (The Parliament of Sri Lanka, 2016) proposes SAITM as a model for expanding private medical education. It promotes ?Public-Private Partnerships? where public universities will support private medical establishments, particularly through infrastructure and personnel.?
?
The focus on SAITM has eclipsed the very great challenges facing us in the sphere of public education. These problems demand a systematic response. Ad hoc measures will be very destructive, and SAITM is such an ad hoc measure?
?
In order to initiate a dialogue and to highlight the dangers involved in such a move, we responded to the report of the Sub-Committee on Higher Education of the Sectoral Oversight Committee on Education and Human Resources Development. On August 21, we met with the Sub-Committee to express our concerns.
The Government?s plans for reforms in higher education and the proposal to support private education hinges on the fact that 82% of those who qualify for admission are shut out from universities.?
They propose private, for-profit, fee-levying institutions to address this problem. For the vast majority of the 82% who will not be able to access private education, the Government proposes loan schemes and voucher systems.?
Numerous other ad hoc educational policies are being proposed and passed by the Cabinet without the consultation of the people of the country. Most recently, on August 22nd, the Cabinet approved the allocation of Rs. 2,700 million for a health insurance scheme for 4.5 million school children, proposed by the Minister of Education, once again without public consultation.
These educational reforms pose a serious threat to ?free education.??
The focus on SAITM has eclipsed the very great challenges facing us in the sphere of public education. These problems demand a systematic response. Ad hoc measures will be very destructive, and SAITM is such an ad hoc measure. It, in no way, solves the larger problems of education, such as disparities in access to education based on wealth, regional differences, ethnicity and language.?
It cannot address the resource problems that schools face, which prevent many students from pursuing their higher educational interests, or the struggles that universities face in offering educational programmes that fulfil the needs and aspirations of the public.
There is a crisis in Medical Education today.?
Students have been boycotting lectures for over six months now. As an immediate solution to the crisis in medical education, we support the call to end the MBBS programme at SAITM. We ask the Government to take immediate steps to commence this process and create the conditions for the return of students to State medical faculties; and halt all activities that expand the privatization agenda specified in the subcommittee report.
The crisis in education calls for a review of the system. We call for a PUBLIC COMMISSION that is committed to hearing what the people have to say undertaken through a consultative process.?
The Government?s commitment to such a commission would be consistent with the principles of free education. A policy for education, developed through a truly representative process, with a commitment to uphold free education as a fundamental value, will further the process of democratizing education, something that we see as essential to the future of our peoples.
