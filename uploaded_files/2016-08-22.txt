Driver keeps President waiting as guards grow tense in Tirupati
	
A major security lapse came to the fore during the visit of President Maithripala Sirisena to Tirumala yesterday, the Hindustan Times reported.
?He was forced to wait?for 12 minutes for his car after a darshan atop the Tirumala hill, giving?jitters to the staff of the Tiruumala Tirupati Devasthanams (TTD),?especially the security.? An inquiry has been ordered into the lapse. The President reached Tirumala late on Saturday night for a two-day pilgrimage.
Upon arrival, the President was received by TTD chairman?Chadalwada Krishnamurthy, executive officer (EO) Sambasiva Rao, Tirupati?joint EO Pola Bhaskar and other officials. He made a night halt at the Sri?Padmavathi guesthouse and arrangements were made for a visit to the temple?of Venkateshwara at Tirumala early yesterday morning.???
At 3 am Sunday, the President along with his wife Jayanthi Pushpa Kumari?Sirisena, son Daham Tharaka and other family members attended the Suprabhata? Seva. When they came out of the sanctum sanctorium, the driver of their car?was not in the seat.???
The President and his wife waited for about 12 minutes inside the car as his?security stood guard around it. Even TTD staffers scurried around, the?driver coolly returned from his own darshan of the deity. Immediately,?Sirisena was driven at speed to the guest house.???
At around 6.30 am, during the VIP break time, the President and his family?returned to the temple to pay obeisance to the presiding deity. He spent?about six minutes inside the sanctum sanctorum and TTD authorities presented?him silk clothes and pandits administered Vedaaseervachanam to the family.???
The minister in waiting, Andhra Pradesh's forest minister Bojjala? Gopalakrishna Reddy presented the president a replica of the Ananda Nilayam? (the dome of the garbhalayam of the temple) on behalf of the AP government.???
Later, the President and his family members left for Bengaluru by road and were?scheduled to fly back to Sri Lanka.???
An inquiry has been ordered into the security lapse. It is learnt that the?driver and other members of the President's retinue sought permission from the?temple authorities for a darshan of the deity. They were reportedly?permitted to enter the sanctum sanctorium despite the visit of the VVIP.? Tirupati Urban superintendent of police Jayalashmi is learnt to have?questioned the temple authorities for giving permission to drivers and other?staff during the VVIP visit.

Financial City:  JVP asks why build on reclaimed land
	
The Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) today asked why the proposed Financial City could not be constructed inland instead of building it on land reclaimed from the sea.
JVP Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake told a media briefing that finding a block of land for this project in Colombo would not be that difficult.
?There are enough spacious lands in the Colombo City to build the Financial City without doing so on land reclaimed from the sea and causing an environmental hazard,? he said.
Mr. Dissanayake said the coastal belt extending through Wellawatte, Mount Lavinia and Moratuwa would be severely affected by sea erosion resulting from reclaiming land from the sea.
?All hotels along this coastal belt will be destroyed in time to come,? he said. (Yohan Perera)

President Maithripala Sirisena should reveal what he knows about his rivals now instead of threatening to do so when a new political party is formed by them, the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) said today.
?Whatever secrets President Sirisena knows about are not personal disputes between his family and that of the Rajapaksas or some personal matter. These are obviously things which the people of this country know about. Therefore the President should reveal these secrets now,? JVP leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake said responding to the statement made by the President at the Matara rally recently.
He threatened to reveal the secrets if the joint opposition formed a separate party.
?The President should not keep such secrets to be disclosed only when his party is threatened,? Mr Dissanayake said. (Yohan Perera)

## Title: OMP: Fear due to lack of information- CTF

OMP: Fear due to lack of information- CTF
	
The Consultation Task Force (CTF), a body set up to deliberate with the public and make recommendations on reconciliation, says the lack of information and awareness about the process by which the Office of Missing Persons was established and its role and functions, has contributed to fear and suspicion in many, including the families of those missing in action (MIAs), that the OMP would exclude them.
Issuing a statement, the CTF says it welcomes the passage of the Act to establish the OMP, as it creates a historic opportunity to address a long-standing problem and provide multiple services to a long neglected group of victims.
The statement says: ?This is a promising beginning to a necessary process of providing redress, justice and accountability, truth and reparations, and will serve as a building block for the transition towards a more democratic, just, equitable and peaceful Sri Lanka.
The CTF recognizes the significance of the decision by the Government to ascertain public views on the Reconciliation Mechanisms it has proposed. The CTF however notes the lack of information about the proposed mechanisms, the lack of awareness about the consultation process and the persistence of fear in parts of the country of speaking out?all of which, hinder this process. The island - wide consultations are currently on going. However, as a result of the Government?s decision to expedite the passage of the OMP Bill, the CTF released two reports based on submissions made to the consultation process, ?Summary of Submissions Received on the Disappeared and the Office of Missing persons? (May 9th 2016) and ?The Office on Missing Persons Bill and Issues concerning the Missing, the Disappeared and the Surrendered.? (Referred to as the Interim Report). Following the CTF?s Summary document and two meetings convened by the Government with civil society organisations and affected families, the Government took on board suggestions to improve the Bill. Notwithstanding this, the CTF is disappointed that key recommendations of the affected families in the Interim Report including on the title, composition and powers of the Office were not included in the Bill.
During consultations, families of the disappeared in general welcomed the establishment of the OMP. However, they had reservations about it, including providing answers regarding the fate of their loved ones. As the CTF's Interim Report notes of the consultation process, it is "? viewed as the most recent in a series of processes and structures that they have engaged in and found nothing but false hope. Indeed, it is difficult to fully convey the determination, exhaustion and desperation expressed by family members who have attempted to seek redress from multiple actors, including successive commissions."
The lack of information and awareness about the process by which the Office was established, its role and functions has contributed to the fear and suspicion, including amongst the families of the Missing in Action (MIA), that the OMP will exclude them. Therefore whilst the Government?s commitment to expedite the establishment of these mechanisms is appreciated, the lack of information, awareness and attention to incorporating public views, particularly of those families affected by disappearances, reveals a troubling lack of sensitivity to the widespread nature of the crime of disappearances in Sri Lanka, the manner in which it continues to haunt families across the country, and the failure on the part of the State to address its horrific complicity in this crime over several decades.

Addressing the first anniversary celebration of the national unity government on Friday, President Sirisena said he would disclose the secrets about some opposition politicians if and when they formed a new party.
The MP said the nondisclosure amounted to aiding and abetting in the wrongdoings.
?As far as we know, there is no relationship between the formation of a new political party and the nabbing of thieves. If anyone has committed a crime, action should be taken against them regardless of forming a new party. The President has given an assurance to protect the secrets of wrongdoers as long as they listen to him. Is this good governance,? he asked at a news conference. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Rio Olympics comes to an end
	
The Rio Olympics ended with a spectacular carnival-inspired closing ceremony, and the official handover to 2020 hosts Tokyo.
The U.S. continues to dominate the Summer Games, as the Americans were all over the podium at the 2016 Rio Olympics. Team USA finished with a total of 121 medals.
Team GB has taken second place in the Olympic medal table with 67 medals - their highest tally at an overseas Olympics.
The colourful ceremony, lasting almost three hours, celebrated Brazil's arts and was held in a wet Maracana.
Among the highlights were Tokyo's impressive showcase and a vibrant carnival parade.
"These were a marvellous Olympics, in a marvellous city," said International Olympic Committee chief Thomas Bach.
"Over the last 16 days a united Brazil inspired the world, in difficult times for all of us, with its irresistible joy for life."
Bach officially closed the Games of the 31st Olympiad after 16 days of competition, featuring 11,303 athletes from 206 nations and a refugee team.
One of the biggest cheers of the night came when Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe appeared dressed as computer game character Super Mario, rising out of a huge green pipe in the stadium.
The ceremony, watched by billions around the world, featured the parade of athletes and a dramatic extinguishing of the Olympic flame.

Sanasa June quarter net falls amid shrinking margins
	
Sanasa Development Bank PLC saw its June quarter (2Q16) net profit falling by as much as 63 percent year-on-year (YoY) to Rs.77.8 million or Rs.1.85 a share due to narrowing margins, higher personnel and other expenses, the interim results?filed with the Colombo Stock Exchange showed.
?
The core banking operations suffered as the bank had to offer higher rates to retain its existing deposit base but the loan book was repriced at a slower pace. The result was the interest expenses rising by 19 percent YoY to Rs.1.95 billion whereas the interest expenses rose by a much faster 45 percent YoY to Rs.1.16 billion.?
This dragged down the earlier comfortable margin between the cost of total funds and interest income from loans and other investments enjoyed by the bank to 5.83 percent from 7.13 percent within six months.?
As a result, the net interest income fell 6 percent to Rs.785.6 million from a year ago. ?The loan book grew by 11 percent or Rs.5.1 billion to Rs.50.9 billion during the six months but the deposits remained unchanged despite offering higher rates.?
The bank had a deposit base of Rs.43.2 billion, 88 branches and 1,217 employees.?
In December 2015, the bank issued a Rs.4 billion debenture and other borrowings also rose by Rs.1.2 billion. Sanasa has fully funded its loan book through borrowings and the absence of new deposits could make the future growth challenging for the bank. ?The bank also saw Rs.897 million worth of held-to-maturity investments being retired. ??
The bank had a total asset base of Rs.61.9 billion, up 3 percent in six months. The net asset per share dropped to Rs.127 from Rs.136 as 1.8 million new shares were listed on June 10, 2016 in lieu of scrip dividend of one for 21.9467.?
Meanwhile, the net fee and commission income grew by 16 percent YoY to Rs.71 million during the June quarter. ?Provisions made for possible bad loans were Rs.24.6 million, 28 percent lower from a year ago, as individual impairments remained lower.?
The steep rise in personnel and other expenses on a YoY basis hurt the June results the most as the former rose by as much as 39 percent or Rs.92 million to Rs.328.7 million during the quarter.?
For the six months ended on June 30, 2016, the bank posted a net profit of Rs.196.6 million or Rs.4.67 a share, 52 percent down from a?
year ago.?
The net interest income was 3 percent lower at Rs.1.6 billion compared to the same period?
last year.?
Dr. T. Senthilverl and Global Rubber Industries held 14.0 percent and 10.31 percent stakes, respectively, as at June 30, 2016, being the first and second largest shareholders, up from 13.8 percent and 9.8 percent, respectively,?
from March.

Mr. Thondaman, a former minister, had been incensed by a police request to a Hindu priest to present himself at the station to inquire into a complaint against him.
Mr. Thondaman had gone near the gate of the police station and sent a provincial council member to the station to call the OIC out. The OIC had gone for a meeting with another senior officer. However, a sub-inspector had gone out to meet him.
Mr. Thondaman had admonished the police officer saying that it was wrong to summon a member of the clergy to the station. He had said the president and the prime minister were not called to the station whenever there was a complaint against them.
The sub-inspector had agreed to go to the priest and record his statement. Mr. Thondaman had then left.(Ranjithj Rajapakse)
