Arson accused SL maid pleads not guilty
	
A Sri Lankan housemaid accused of setting her Bahraini employer's home on fire before fleeing has appeared in court for the first time to plead not guilty.
According to the Gulf Daily News, the 48-year-old woman had allegedly doused her room in petrol and set it alight before running away as the rest of the family was sleeping.
Video footage shows her covering a surveillance camera in the house, in Jid Ali, with cloth moments before the fire broke out on January 7, the High Criminal Court heard.
The blaze caused 70 per cent damage to the maid's living quarters, according to court documents. However, she had pleaded not guilty to arson yesterday.
She admitted fleeing the home due to alleged mistreatment by her employer, but denied starting the fire. "My sponsor's wife always treated me badly and gave me a lot of work to do," she said in her statement to prosecutors.
"I fled the house because of the mistreatment and I covered the camera so I wouldn't be seen when I was fleeing. "I then took two bags containing my clothes and a bag full of garbage and left the house after midnight."
She said she removed the cloth from the surveillance camera before she fled because she was afraid it would get damaged. The 47-year-old Bahraini employer told prosecutors that he was woken up by his son, who first realised a fire had broken out.
"My son came and shook me awake as he shouted that the house was on fire," he said in his statement. "He said that thick smoke and fire were coming out of the maid's room so I rushed in and attempted to put out the fire.
Judges adjourned the trial yesterday until May 14 to appoint a defence lawyer for the housemaid.

## Title: Asia Cup to switch to T20 format

Asia Cup to switch to T20 format
	
		 		 
		 
			
The Asia Cup is set to undergo a radical change and will be a Twenty20 competition in 2016 for the first time, outgoing Asian Cricket Council chief executive Syed Ashraful Haq has revealed.
The ACC is to be wound down by June 30 and its operations absorbed by the International Cricket Council, prompting fears the Asia Cup tournament could be disbanded. However, Haq confirmed to cricket.com.au that not only would the tournament continue every two years, it would be revamped to include more Associate nations and mirror the format of the World Cup event to follow. Haq confirmed reports the ACC's headquarters in Kuala Lumpur would close on June 30 and the development work currently done by the organisation would be taken over by the ICC. He said the 2016 Asia Cup would be held early next year as a prelude to the ICC World Twenty20, with the latter to be hosted by India from March 11 to April 3. It would then revert to a 50-over tournament in 2018 ahead of the 2019 World Cup in England and be played as a Twenty20 competition again in 2020.
Haq suggested the change in format could also see two Associate nations join India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh in the tournament. Afghanistan, Nepal, Hong Kong and United Arab Emirates have Twenty20 status. "As there is a World Twenty20 tournament in 2016, the Asia Cup next year will also be of Twenty20 Internationals in February or March," Haq told cricket.com.au. "The host country has not been decided yet." Bangladesh hosted the previous two Asia Cups in 2014 and 2012. "There may be one or two teams from Associate nations as well," Haq added. "They could join India, Bangladesh, Pakistan and Sri Lanka in the main tournament after playing a qualifying round." The Asia Cup will return to an ODI format in 2018 with the biennial event set to mirror the format of the major ICC event that follows. It's a change that will allow Asia Cup contestants to fine-tune for World Cups with in a major regional competition. "The year 2020 will again see the tournament in Twenty20 format and there will be another ODI (50-over) Asia Cup in 2022," Haq said. Sri Lanka won the last Asia Cup, held in Bangladesh in 2014, and has won the competition five times since its inception in 1984. Pakistan have won twice  in 2012 and 2000  while India are also five time winners.
If two teams are included from the Associate nations, the 2016 Asia Cup could see six teams competing in the tournament for only the third time. Afghanistan took part in the 2014 tournament, which featured five teams, while UAE and Hong Kong were part the 2004 and 2008 Cups, which both featured six teams. The changes mean the 2016 Asia Cup will be the biggest Twenty20 tournament outside of the ICC World Twenty20. The revamp of the ACC will also see Haq's 32-year association with the organisation  which began on its first day of operation in 1983  finish at the end of the financial year. There will be no chief executive position in the new ACC and the current headquarters in Kuala Lumpur will close, with the two remaining ACC employees to work from Singapore. Some other staff members including ACC coaches Aminul Islam and Venkatapathy Raju will work for the ICC from July 1. But Haq shrugged off suggestions the changes to the ACC meant the Asia Cup's future was in doubt. "It is correct that Asian Cricket Council (ACC) is being dwindled down to only two employees who will work from Singapore," he said. "Whatever the development work ACC used to do will now be done by the International Cricket Council. "However, the Asia Cup will continue to take place after every two years. "The Asia Cup events have been slotted in for next eight years in the Future Tours Programme." The Asia Cup was first held in 1984, with 12 tournaments held in the ODI format and two Test Championships in 1999 and 2001-02. India and Sri Lanka winning five titles each, while Pakistan has won the event twice. Sri Lanka won the 2014 edition, defeating Pakistan by five wickets in the final.(cricket.com.au)

Naxals getting arms from Sri Lanka
	
		 		 
		 
			
India's Central intelligence agencies have launched a major investigation into a specific tip-off that Naxals were now getting sophisticated weapons through the sea route from Sri Lanka, The Asian Age reported.
Top intelligence sources claimed that they had received information some time back that Naxals were routing arms and ammunition through the sea route through an arms cartel which was suspected to be earlier providing weapons to the LTTE as well. It is suspected that the weapons are coming through Sri Lanka using the sea route, sources added.
Till now it has been confirmed that Naxals were primarily getting weapons, mostly of Chinese origin, either through the Nepal route or through some terror outfits operating in the Northeast, like the Kamtapur Liberation Organisation (KLO) and even the ULFA, who would bring in weapons via Myanmar.
But intelligence officials are worried about this new supply route being used by the Maoists to procure sophisticated weapons, including the AK-series rifles, landmines, grenade launchers, communication equipment and even Night Vision Devices (NVDs).
We have been getting specific inputs that some arms dealers who had been involved with the LTTE earlier are now sourcing weapons to the Naxals as well. This arms cartel has been operating via the sea route since the LTTE days and the same channel is now said to be used for the providing weapons to Naxals also. This indeed is a worrying trend since Naxals are slush with funds and if they get access to state-of-the-art weaponry then they can cause problems for out security forces, a senior intelligence official informed this newspaper.
The Naxals have been on the offensive over the past few days launching at least three major attacks on the security forces.

## Title: No room for family rule in future: Maithri

No room for family rule in future: Maithri
	
	In an interview with Times Magazine, President Maithripala Sirisena said once the Constitution was amended there would be noroom left for any single family to control the country in the future.
	Sri Lanka fell into the hands of one family. With the amendments to the Constitution, we will not leave room for any single family to control the country ever again, he told Time Magazine.
	The following is the full Time Magazine article:
	When the Sri Lankan Presidents motorcade encounters a red light now on the streets of the capital, Colombo, it does something unthinkable just months agoit stops and waits for a green signal. The convoy itself is much smaller than it once was, down to three or four cars and two motorcycles from the as many as 16 cars and numerous outriders that sped through this port city until the man at the center of the processionthe then President Mahinda Rajapaksaencountered an unexpected red light on Jan. 8.
	That morning, election results showed a sudden reversal for Rajapaksa, 69, who had ruled the island nation for nine years. In 2009 he crushed separatists from Sri Lankas Tamil minority to end a nearly three-decade civil war in a final push that the U.N. says may have claimed the lives of as many as 40,000 Tamil civilians. A year later, backed by the countrys Sinhala Buddhist majority, Rajapaksa overwhelmingly won a second term in office. As he tightened his grip on power, blithely ignoring calls to investigate allegations of human-rights abuses during the close of the war, the extended Rajapaksa clan wrapped itself around government like out-of-control wisteria. One of the Presidents brothers oversaw national defense, another had charge of economic development. A third was Speaker of Parliament. Dissidents, meanwhile, risked being squashed by an iron fist. Critical journalists and activists were arbitrarily detained or harassed by shadowy thugs who would haul them away in unmarked white vans. Some did not return. (The Rajapaksa regime has denied any such involvement.)
	Then, suddenly, it was over for the mustachioed strongman. Voters jettisoned him in favor of a little-known former ally who promised to be the anti-Rajapaksa. Maithripala Sirisena, 63, pledged to reverse Sri Lankas slide toward autocracy and save it from becoming a one-family state. Even Sirisena was surprised by the outcome. For a short period after being elected, I was not really certain that I am the President, Sirisena tells Time, breaking into a smile during an interview at his Colombo office, his first with an English-language news organization since becoming Sri Lankas leader. Similarly, the Rajapaksa family  must be thinking, What happened here 
	More than Rajapaksas extensive motorcade and security detail are out. The former presidential compoundexpanded by Rajapaksa to include a 5,000-capacity banquet hall with shimmering chandeliers that change color at the flick of a switchhas been passed to the new Prime Minister, Ranil Wickremesinghe, who uses it as an office. Sirisena continues to live in the Colombo home he occupied as Rajapaksas Health Minister.
	Its not just optics, say Sirisenas aides. He is supporting constitutional amendments to weaken presidential powers, reintroduce term limits scrapped under Rajapaksa, and share authority with a stronger parliamentary executive headed by the Prime Minister. Under the Rajapaksas, Sirisena tells Time, Sri Lanka fell into the hands of one family: With the amendments to the constitution, we will not leave room in the future for any single family to control the country in this manner ever again.Chain Reaction
	sri lanka is one of the developing worlds oldest democracies, with a tradition of elections that predates full independence from the colonial British in 1948. So a return to past freedoms and a lighter governing touch are critical for the countrys future after years of strife. But the ripples of Sirisenas unexpected ascent reach beyond Sri Lanka. Whether it wishes or not, the island nation is a player in a geopolitical game among bigger powers.
	Sirisena works out of a large first-floor office in a grand colonial-era building on the Colombo waterfront. Right opposite, extending out from shore, giant red cranes loom over piles of rock and sandthe site for the Colombo port-city project, an ambitious $1.4 billion Rajapaksa-era venture to build shopping malls, hotels and apartment complexes on reclaimed land that has been suspended as the new government reviews the projects approvals and permits. Backed by Beijing, which pumped billions of dollars in loans to fund big-ticket infrastructure projects under Rajapaksa, the project was inaugurated in September by Chinese President Xi Jinping.
	Xis visit underlined Sri Lankas growing strategic significance. Though small, with a population of only around 20 million, Sri Lanka sits just off Indias southern coast, making it a coveted bridgehead to the vast Indian Oceanwhere India, China and the U.S. are vying for influence. Falling out with the West over his alleged human-rights record, Rajapaksa steered Sri Lanka toward Beijing, borrowing billions and then twice last year alarming India by allowing a Chinese submarine to dock in Colombo. Rajapaksa had been very much playing up his relationship with China, says Teresita Schaffer, a former U.S. ambassador to Sri Lanka and a senior fellow at the Washington-based Brookings Institution, casting it as the diplomatic equivalent of thumbing his nose at the West for its focus on allegations of wartime abuses.
	The election of Sirisena, whose campaign manifesto said Sri Lankas foreign policy had fallen into disarray after the military victory of 2009, has sparked speculation of a diplomatic realignment. I dont call it a tilt away from China, Prime Minister Wickremesinghe tells Time. The fact is we moved away from everyone else, leaving only China. We antagonized the West, we antagonized India. You cant carry on like this. Sri Lanka needs the West, it needs India, it needs China.
	Indeed, since January, Sirisena has visited Indiahis first overseas trip after taking officehosted its Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and traveled to China, where he was accorded a grand welcome, complete with an honor guard at Beijings Great Hall of the People. Still, the now suspended port project has become something of a test case for relations between Colombo and Beijing. Sirisena says his administration is reviewing both foreign-funded and domestic ventures as it investigates allegations of irregularities and corruption under the previous regime. But, he tells Time, we do not have any enmity toward anybody; we extend the hand of friendship to all countries.An Unlikely Leader
	There is little in Sirisenas political rsum to herald a disrupter. Like Rajapaksa, Sirisena is a member of the countrys Sinhala Buddhist majority and a veteran of the establishment Sri Lanka Freedom Party, joining its youth wing while still at school. In the early 1970s, Sirisena was jailed for 15 months for his alleged involvement in a left-wing antigovernment insurrection. He was arrested again in the late 70s, shortly after quitting his job as a local administrative official to become a full-time politician, eventually entering Parliament in 1989. In the years that followed, Sirisena held a series of key party posts and did a variety of ministerial jobs. Throughout, he avoided scandal and cultivated an image as a clean-living leader with his feet firmly rooted in the paddy fields of his native Polonnaruwa districttraits that served him well when he defected from Rajapaksas side in November. He made a contrast with the [Rajapaksa familys] plans for dynastic rule, their love of luxury, the allegations of large-scale corruption, says Alan Keenan, a senior analyst with the International Crisis Group.
	Sirisena has also won a global PR battle. Rajapaksa resisted international pressure to allow a U.N. probe or to conduct an independent local inquiry into the allegations of human-rights abuses by the military at the end of the civil war against the separatist fighters of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam. (The Tigers were themselves known for brutalitythey pioneered the use of suicide bombers.) Sirisena campaigned with the promise of setting up an independent domestic probe, the details of which, he tells Time, will be announced by the end of June. Giving Sirisena time, the U.N. has postponed the release of its own report to September. Colombo has also appointed a new governor in the Tamil-dominated Northern Province, replacing a retired soldier with a civilian, and has revived efforts to form a South Africastyle truth and reconciliation commission.
	But, first, Sirisenas political supporters must win re-election. The President tells Time that he plans to dissolve Parliament in May, which means a general election at the end of June or early July. The vote could bring Rajapaksa back into the political picturean aide says he is likely to contest a parliamentary seat. He is like a sword of Damocles over the new government, says Paikiasothy Saravanamuttu, executive director of the Centre for Policy Alternatives, a Colombo-based think tank. In his villa in the seaside town of Tangalle on the southern coast, Rajapaksa tells Time that the new government should not write him off: Too much of confidence is not so good. He also denies accusations of misrule, nepotism and allegations that, before he left in January, he attempted to forcibly hold on to power. Rajapaksa tells Time the new government wants to throw mud at him.
	For now, Sirisena is looking good. As he nears the completion of his first 100 days in office, activists and journalists in Colombo speak of a more tolerant attitude toward critical voices. I feel less scared now, says Ruki Fernando, a human-rights activist detained last year when investigating the arrest of a Tamil campaigner against political disappearances. If you look at the state media, people they called traitors before are now on TV talk shows.
	Sirisena says he wants to reinforce the foundations of Sri Lankas democracy. I came here not to strengthen power but to give over the power that is in my hands, he says. Its a major problem for the country that power has been centralized. Power must be distributed. In a nation that only months ago seemed destined to become a full-fledged autocracy, that messageand hoperings loudest of all.

	Sri Lanka's economic growth is expected to drop to 6.9 percent due to the slowing down of construction activities, the World Bank says in a report.
	The World Bank, in its report on South Asia, said the high consumption levels triggered by the salary hikes of public servants would somewhat offset the impact.
	It also said the new government was reassessing the investment-led economic policy.

SL refugees in Nauru will be resettled in Cambodia-Aussie
	
		 		 
		 
			
Refugees including from Sri Lanka, rejected by Australia will soon fly from the Pacific atoll of Nauru to be resettled in Cambodia, the Australian Broadcasting Corp. said quoting the Australian government on Thursday.
ABC reported that a charter flight on Monday will fly the first refugees to be resettled in Phnom Penh under a bilateral agreement signed by Cambodia and Australia last September.
Immigration Minister Peter Dutton's office did not specify when the first group will fly.
"The first group of volunteers is anticipated to depart for Cambodia in the near future," Dutton's office said in a statement.
The specific nationalities of the people to be sent to Cambodia were not released. Refugees from many countries, including Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iran and Sri Lanka, have tried to reach Australia in recent years.
The agreement specifies that all refugees who leave the Australia-run detention camp on Nauru must be volunteers.
The deal with Cambodia will cost the Australian government more than 10 million Australian dollars ($7.6 million) a year and has been condemned by human rights groups.
ABC reports that a fact sheet distributed among refugees at Nauru promises a one-off package for the first who agree to be resettled.
They were offered "cash in hand and in a bank account," ABC reported.
The package includes help finding work, and access to education, language training and health insurance, ABC said.
Dutton's office declined to provide AP with a copy of the fact sheet.
Australia refuses to resettle refugees who attempt to reach its shores by boat. It pays Nauru to house asylum seekers and has a similar deal with Papua New Guinea.
More than 200 of the 1,200 asylum seekers on Nauru, mostly from South Asia and the Middle East, had been assessed to be genuine refugees.
