ASEAN leaders mark India?s 69th Republic Day
	
?
HINDUSTAN TIMES, 26th JANUARY, 2018- Marching contingents, strategic defence weaponry and colourful tableaux were on display as India celebrated its 69th Republic Day with a grand parade watched by thousands of people along with 10 ASEAN leaders who attended the event as chief guests, in a historic first.
Signifying India?s fast growing strategic ties with ASEAN, leaders of all the 10 countries of the powerful bloc attended the parade at the majestic Rajpath which showcased the country?s military might and cultural diversity. Cold weather conditions and dense fog failed to dampen the enthusiasm of thousands of spectators who witnessed the nearly one-and-half-hour-long parade that marched down the eight-kilometre stretch from the Rajpath to the Red Fort amid an unprecedented security cover.
The ASEAN leaders, here to attend the India-ASEAN Commemorative Summit, joined President Ram Nath Kovind and Modi at the Republic Day parade, making it an unprecedented event.

Hearing of SAITM issue in SC: SLMC sub committee decides not to give its opinion
	
The Sri Lanka Medical Council?s (SLMC) sub committee on the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) issue has decided to refrain from giving its opinion to the Supreme Court on the SAITM at the relevant hearing, reliable sources confirmed.
The sources said the SLMC had reached at this decision with the approval of its majority on the grounds that the degree awarded by the SAITM has not been registered so far with the SLMC.
It said the SLMC was in a position to give its opinion only on an accepted degree awarding institute.
?Accordingly, the SLMC would not give its opinion during the upcoming hearings in the Supreme Court on the SAITM issue,? it said.
It said that the SLMC could only give its opinion on a degree that has been registered with it and added that the only advice that could be given to the students of SAITM was to obtain a medical degree from an accepted institute.
It also said the SLMC had arrived at this decision following a proposal made by a Government Medical Officers? Association (GMOA) representative in this regard. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)

Japan says some Ceylon tea are not up to required standards
	
Japanese authorities have informed Sri Lanka that some of the Ceylon tea exports to that country are not up to the required standards because of the presence of a chemical component, Plantation Industries Minister Navin Dissanayake said.
He said the issue was discussed at the highest level and that the Sri Lanka Tea Board Chairman was also scheduled to leave for Japan at the end of this month.
?They have not issued any warnings but they have said that some of our teas that are coming to Japan are not meeting the standards. There is a particular chemical component (MCPA) in tea and that is over and above the standards they have set. Our tea exports are up to the standards set by the European market. Now the Japanese standard is much higher than the European standard. The chemical level found in some exports is higher than accepted by the Japanese,? the minister said.
He said Sri Lanka had asked Japan for ?some time' to resolve this issue.
?What we are requesting them is to give us some time, about six months. We can adapt our procedures and introduce a new chemical that they can accept within the given timeframe so that this problem will be resolved,? the minister said.
He said the chemical levels in tea have increased with the use of weedicides introduced as an alternative for Glyphosate.
?We have told the companies not to use this alternative. We have to have a better weedicide. If Glyposate was not banned, we wouldn?t be having this issue,? he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Remembering  St. Paul in Kandy
	
The inside of the Church now with the Stained Glass window at the extreme
?
Saint Paul?s Church in Kandy stood the changing times for one hundred and seventy-five years, dedicated to Saint Paul, who was born as Saul.
Paul the Apostle, commonly known as Saint Paul and also known by his Jewish name Saul of Tarsus, was an apostle who taught the gospel of the Christ to the first century world. He was born to Jewish parents in a tribe living in the town of Tarsus.?
Later Saint Paul was arrested by Nero, the ruler of Rome. Paul was executed as a lesson to the people, who resisted Roman Empire.
The Church in Kandy was named after St. Paul, the Apostle.
After the British annexed the Kandyan Kingdom, the historic Audience Hall was used for Sunday Service.
?
But, the Church continued to serve its parishioners and lived in the midst of a religious atmosphere. It still continues its Sunday Services and other ceremonies
?
Bishop- the second Lord Bishop of Calcutta whose diocese extended to Ceylon. On August 15, 1825, he visited Sri Lanka via the port of Galle.
With Governor Edward Barnes, Bishop Herber visited Kandy on September 14, 1825 - ten years after the British conquered the country.
On September 18, 1825, he held a Confirmation Service at the?
Audience Hall.
Bishop Reginald Heber was not satisfied with the use of the Audience Hall as a Church and he informed the Governor that this was out of taste. On the other hand, the Buddhist clergy and the Trustees of the Devales also did not agree with this arrangement.
Taking this opportunity the Legislative Council brought out ?The Church Ordinance? and allowed one thousand five hundred Sterling Pounds for the building of a Church in Kandy. This is the beginning of the St. Paul?s Church Kandy. The Church stands in the form of a cross inside of which has no pillars. It is built on Herring Bone architecture with all Satinwood.
The land according to the former Diyawadana Nilame, Neranjan Wijeyaratne, was once a part of the Wel Bodhiya, which is currently the property of Asgiri Mahanayake.
This land was acquired by the Government and it issued a public notice of any objections. The objections were to be personally brought before the Government Agent. No Buddhist monks would make his way at that time and since the time had lapsed, the land was handed over to St. Paul?s Church. Under a Sacred Area concept St. Paul?s school was removed and twenty acres of land was allocated to the Trustees of St. Paul?s Church to re-build a Church at Tennakumbura.
But, over the years it did not materialise. Instead, a Vocational Training Institute was established. The Government of the day did not pursue it further and there stands St. Paul?s Church.
?The St.Paul?s College was demolished and in its place Sumangala College was established with all the students from St. Paul?s College taken into the new school,? the former Diyawadana Nilame said.
But, the Church continued to serve its parishioners and lived in the midst of a religious atmosphere. It still continues its Sunday Services and other ceremonies.
The exact date of Church building is obscure. The consecration of the present Church building was by Bishop of Colombo Rev. James Chapman on January 25, 1853.
?
?
In a note, he says that the Church is 120 feet long and 80 feet wide.
The original building would have been constructed on the lines of English Churches.
Some records indicate the date thirty years before. There are no proper records, except the visit of the Bishop of Calcutta in 1825, Rev. Reginald Heber and his arrival in Kandy with Governor Barnes.
The main Church building, however, had been altered in 1878, 1928 and 1953. It has stood the test of time and also moved with the changing times.
But what the Church lost was the original stained Glass window installed by the widow of a coffee planter Laurence St. George Carey of De Vallon Estate, Pussellawa in 1874.
Sadly the stained glass window was shattered in the 1998 LTTE bomb attack on the Sri Dalada Maligawa.
Yet, it was left to a Buddhist Technician, Ajith Gunasekera to put it back, piece by piece, and restore it.
Today it stands with a few pieces missing with all its glory.
St. Paul?s Church is a landmark in the historic town and blends with the heritage aspect giving any visitor the magnanimity of Buddhist principles and the teachings of Buddha.

SriLankan CEO steps down
	
Controversial SriLankan Airlines CEO Suren Ratwatte was asked to step down following a Board meeting on Thursday with Manoj Gunawardene tipped to be the hot favourite to take over, the Daily FT reported quoting top Government officials.
The move comes amidst plans to restructure the troubled national carrier, with its Chairman and Board of Directors expected to step down once the Government finalises the reform agenda.
?The CEO has stepped down and Manoj Gunawardene is very likely to be his replacement,? a senior Government official who spoke to Daily FT on the condition of anonymity said.
When asked about the changes, a member of the Board said ?decisions on restructuring and changes in personnel need approval of the ministerial committee under the Prime Minister which includes the line Minister.?
The appointment will be finalised during next week?s board meeting upon Company Chairman Ajit Dias? return to the country, Daily FT learnt.
SriLankan Airline employee unions had repeatedly called for Ratwatte?s removal from the post amidst claims that he was unable to keep the cash trapped airline from taking a nosedive. The Unions were receptive of the possibility of Guwardene?s appointment.
Gunawardene held the same portfolio for a period of three years from 2008.
Earlier in the week, SriLankan Airlines said it had achieved the highest-ever monthly revenue in the company?s history in December 2017.
The air-transport operation of the company recorded a stand-alone revenue of $ 100.1 million, the first instance in the 38-year history of the airline where monthly operating revenue reached this landmark figure.
The airline attributed the increase in revenue to its expanded network and continuous improvement in revenue management processes. The company recorded a net positive result for the month even after interest costs, with an un-audited net profit of $ 3 million.

State revenue given to private firms on political links during past 3 years: Prez
	
Firing yet another barrage ahead of the local government polls, President Maithripala Sirisena said yesterday the government incurred a major loss of revenue during the past three years because it had been channelled to private companies on political connections.
He said this at a meeting with the heads of print and electronic media institutions.
The President said several more frauds had taken place in the re-export business, even sullying the image of Ceylon Tea and Pepper.
?Amid this unscrupulous trading practice, tea of inferior quality was imported to Sri Lanka for value addition before being re-exported as tea of Sri Lankan origin. It has brought Sri Lanka?s tea trade into disrepute. In addition to tea, even pepper, dry arecanuts called karunka and pineapples wee imported to be re-exported in this same manner,? he said.
The President said there was a huge price difference between the actual cost and the retail prices of various items sold in the local market and that he had raised this matter on more than 100 occasions in the Cabinet though little or nothing happened.
?Let's say the import cost is sometimes only Rs.500. With a profit margin, it can be easily sold at Rs.750 but it is sold at Rs.1,500. The Consumer Affairs Authority (CAA) should look into it,? he said.
Commenting on the annual budgetary allocations for various sectors, the President said only 50 to 60 per cent of it had been spent by the year end.
Referring to economic matters of the previous regime, he said the then government had made external borrowings amounting to Rs.10 trillion, but the accomplishments on the ground had reflected an expenditure amounting to Rs.1 trillion.
?I am saying this with responsibility after a proper study. The figure is in trillions. In fact, I even consulted someone with expertise on arithmetic to ascertain the veracity of these figures. Only Rs.1 trillion has been documented,? he said.
Referring to the Central Bank bond scam, the President said though this government was elected to eliminate corruption, the ?General Treasury? was plundered barely two months after it assumed office and asked how he could remain passive in the face of stoic silence by some in the face of such massive frauds.
The President said through he had initially intended to make his statement only on the scam, he was compelled to do so prematurely by those who kept pushing for it.
The President said there were bundles equal to two lorry loads of supportive documents submitted to the Presidential Commission which probed the bond scam.
?I made my statement after consulting legal experts. In fact, this is the first statement made by me in my whole political life, with the involvement of others.The PRECIFAC report was also presented in the meantime. It was not something pre-planned only a coincidence. It was only the bond report that was handed over and one side would have agitated for a debate ahead of the elections but they remained silent because of the PRECIFAC report,? he said.
The President said an unholy alliance of bandits had emerged to cover up corruption and frauds.
Commenting the abortive attempt by former minister Ravi Karunanayake to make a statement in Parliament on the allegations against him, the President said it would have been politically suicidal for him had he made that statement.
He said Prime Minster Ranil Wickremesinghe had stopped Mr. Karunanayake from making that statement on one occasion and Speaker Karu Jayasuriya on the other.
Declining to say more on the bond scam, he said some ill-gotten money had been sneaked out for bribing some officials. (Kelum Bandara)

Taliban suicide bomb kills 95 in Kabul
	
A Taliban suicide bomb attack has killed at least 95 people and injured 158 others in the centre of Afghanistan's capital, Kabul, BBC reported.
Attackers had driven an ambulance laden with explosives past a police checkpoint into a street that was only open to government workers.
It has happened near the old interior ministry building and offices of the European Union and High Peace Council.
The Taliban have said they carried out the attack, the deadliest for months.
Witnesses say the area - home to foreign embassies and the city's police headquarters - was crowded with people when the bomb exploded on Saturday at about 12:15 local time (08:45 GMT).
Officials said the death toll would probably continue to rise as casualties were brought to hospitals for medical attention.
The International Committee of the Red Cross said the use of an ambulance was "harrowing".

To a wonderful sister
	
My beloved sister Daphne Kulasekere was called to eternal rest on the 22nd of January 2017, a year ago, leaving a permanent void for all her loved ones.
Born on the 18th of January 1953, Daphne had her education at Princess of Wales College, Moratuwa. She followed a career in Music (Pianoforte) and obtained professional qualifications from Trinity and Royal College of Music, London.
She started teaching music at the very young age of 19 years for around 15 students. She was actively involved in church work and was the organist of the Methodist Church Suduwella, Moratuwa and a dedicated Sunday School teacher.
She migrated to Canada in 1977 and lived a peaceful life with her family. She was married to Felix (Rohantha) and was blessed with two sons, Travis and Troy.
She was a very famous and much loved music teacher in Calgary and had the privilege of teaching many for more than three decades. She was attached to the Alberta School of Ballet and an appreciation for her dedicated services, the School held its annual concert- 2017 in memory of her.
She was also the organist at the St. Augustine?s Anglican Church and the United Church in Calgary. The Funeral service was held at Christ Church Elbow Park, Calgary.
I wish to share some of the vivid, wonderful and nostalgic memories of her. We were very close to each other in a wonderful family atmosphere and lived happily under the guidance of caring parents and God almighty. When she started earning, she never failed to give me pocket money. It was she who dropped me off to the University hostel in 1975 with words of encouragement to study hard. She taught me how to ride a bicycle and to drive a car. My memory recalls, the fun we had during Christmas time singing Christmas Carols with family and friends, with my sister on the piano.
My sister never lost the common touch and was devoted to her family members, especially to the relations and friends in need. She was constantly in touch with her family and visited us regularly. The annual Christmas card from her was much awaited by all relations. Throughout her life she epitomized kindness, love and compassion for the needy. I am told by my sons who visited her in Calgary recently, how excited she was to have them at her home. She would look after them as her own and would stay up impatiently until they returned from their evening visits with the cousins.
In 2015, she spent Christmas with my family in Sri Lanka along with Travis her eldest son, and had a wonderful holiday. We had a family and friends get-together and as usual she was on the piano entertaining us all with Christmas hymns, songs and oldies that brings us fond memories.
Further, I was really moved by her very friendly approach towards my little granddaughters who still talk high of Daphne Achcha. In spite of her own declining health condition, she had played the piano, one last time, at the cancer hospital during the Christmas of 2016, entertaining the patients and its staff. Though we were apart, we never felt it, as we were constantly in touch with each other. My several visits to her home in Calgary too brought us much closer. Her love, affection and dedication to the family is admirable and exceptional. A thanksgiving service in her memory was held on the 1st April 2017 at the Suduwella Methodist church with a large gathering and an inspirational message was delivered by our cousin Ivor Poobalan. I take this opportunity to thank all those who attended the service. She was a loving daughter to our parents late Justin and Charlotte, a caring sister both to me and my brother Bernel (deceased) and a very loving and affectionate mother to her sons Travis & Troy - she truly was an ?inspiration?.
We all miss her so very much! I thank God for her life and it is my belief that we will meet each other again on that ?beautiful shore?.

Zimbabwe university releases Grace Mugabe?s PhD thesis
	
REUTERS, 26th JANUARY, 2018- The University of Zimbabwe has published former First Lady Grace Mugabe?s PhD thesis after an anti-corruption watchdog said it was investigating whether the wife of ousted President Robert Mugabe was wrongly awarded a doctorate three years ago.
Grace graduated in 2014, the same year she launched her career in the ruling ZANU-PF party, a power push that led ultimately to November?s de facto coup by political rivals worried she was set to take over from her husband. In contravention of its normal practice, the university did not publish her 226-page thesis, entitled ?The changing social structure and functions of the family: The case of children?s homes in Zimbabwe?, until this week, when it was released on its website (http://ir.uz.ac.zw/handle/10646/3463). It was not clear why Grace, who runs a children?s home near her family dairy farm outside Harare, used her second name and maiden surname - Ntombizodwa G. Marufu - for the paper.
University of Zimbabwe vice chancellor Levi Nyagura did not respond to calls for comment.
