A popular Mayor Devoted to Service
	
It is hard to imagine that 10 years have elapsed since the demise of Ganesh. He was a very popular figure who served everybody regardless of caste, creed, race and religion to the best of his ability. ??
Ganesh was born in Palaly in the Jaffna peninsula on January 3, 1938 and was a son of Mr. Kanagasabey a well-known lawyer who had a lucrative practice. He had his early education at Hartley College, a famous educational institution that has produced many eminent personalities. For his secondary education he moved to S. Thomas? College Mount Lavinia. It is significant that though the family consists of eight children (six boys and two girls) he was the only one sent to Colombo to pursue his studies. He was in the boarding at S. Thomas? College and shone at both studies and sports.
??
Ganesh was extremely intelligent, though he did not devote as much time to his studies and was not a bookworm. He came under the tutelage of Rev. Roy H. Bowyer-Yin a famous Cambridge University College who whilst serving as Chaplain at S. Thomas? College also taught mathematics in the University entrance class. Ganesh had no difficulty in obtaining entrance to the University of Ceylon. During those leisurely days the University students did not engage in strikes or hartals but most of them seemed to be youth who were keen on changing the world. This was a phenomenon not only confined to our country.
They had socialist ideas and were keen on upliftment of society in general. Elections at University were taken very seriously and was a matter of prestige. Ganesh contested and never lost an election. He then moved on and joined Ford-Rhodes-Thornton & Co. to study accountancy. He was very popular with his colleagues and superiors and in addition to his clients because of his friendly disposition. Thereafter, he launched into many business ventures, all of which proved very successful because of his hard work, attention to detail, and the business ethics that he always practised. ??
Politics was always a passion with Ganesh. He took an active role in this and was a very popular Mayor of Colombo. He did much for the city, widening roads, uplifting shanty dwellers, making arrangements for garbage clearance. At most social gatherings Ganesh was the centre of attraction as he always led the discussions on the latest political developments in the country and his views on what should be done. He was very articulate though not dogmatic or inflexible and even those who may not have agreed with him never felt any animosity towards him as they accepted he was sincere in his beliefs. ?
He was very loyal to his Alma Mater and helped S. Thomas? in whatever way he could. He was a live wire in the Mustangs Tent at every Royal-Thomian match. ?
A famous Spanish historian stated that ?Those who forget their past are condemned to relive it?. Ganesh believed in this and never forgot his roots. He was always keen on helping his ancestral village. Sadly, the conflict that prevailed Sri Lanka at that time, prevented him from visiting as often as he would have liked. Ganesh was very fortunate in having a contented family life. His wife Yamuna, daughter of a well-known physician in Point Pedro, Dr. P. Sri Padmanathan, was a great source of strength to him in all his endeavours and stood by him in good times and in bad. His two children Menaka and Kantheepan were a great source of joy to him, and both of them live and work in London. He has two grandchildren who have excelled in their studies. ??
Except for one, all of Ganesh?s other siblings live overseas. This is a sad predicament in which most Jaffna Tamils are placed in today. Though he had many opportunities to migrate, he always stated that he would live and die in the land of his birth. As Mayor of Colombo, the thing that brought him most joy was when he received His Holiness Pope John Paul II in January 1995. He was also very touched when he received a note from Mother Theresa who was canonised recently, in which she stated ?Dear Mr. Ganeshalingam this brings to you my humble gratitude on behalf of all the poor. God Bless you?. ??
Ganesh has left us. Yamuna has done much to keep his memory alive. Our prayers are with her and other members of his family that God will be with them in their grief. ??

Cross talk over alleged UL shady deals
	
The government and the joint opposition yesterday made allegations against each other on alleged shady deals involving the national carrier SriLankan Airlines during the past and the present regimes in Parliament yesterday.
Joint opposition MP Mahindananda Aluthgamage alleged the lease agreement on the A250 aircraft acquisition had been cancelled without the approval of the board of directors of the national carrier.
State Enterprises Development Deputy Minister Eran Wickramarathne and subject minister Kabir Hashim denounced this claim and said the board of Directors had approved the move.
Both the Minister and the deputy said the carrier had been running at a loss because of business decisions made during the last regime.
?The carrier had lost Rs. 132 billion in 2014," he said the previous regime had even ordered a VIP kit in one of the aircraft. He said the deal to request the aircraft was signed at the residence of former Speaker Chamal Rajapaksa during the last regime. (Yohan Perera)

?Great Heroes Day? (Maaveerar Naal), is an LTTE event, not a Tamil  National Day of Mourning
	
By D.B.S.Jeyaraj?
November 27, 1989, was the day on which the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) first observed its annual ?Maaveerar Naal? or Great Heroes Day (GHD). 27 years have passed since then and the 27th anniversary of the event fell on Nov 27, 2016. ? The event continues to be observed on a large scale by sections of the Global Tamil Diaspora despite the military debacle suffered by the LTTE in May 2009. The event has lost much of its lustre after the demise of Tiger supremo Veluppillai Prabhakaran.These are days of decline when compared to the manner in which Great heroes day was observed when the LTTE ruled the roost. Nevertheless, commemorating the fallen Tigers as great heroes annually remains an enduring Tiger legacy despite the LTTE being militarily decimated?in Sri Lanka. ?
?
?
There is a mystique about ?Maaveerar Naal? that has captured the imagination of a very large number of the Sri Lankan Tamil Diaspora. What makes the GHD tick despite the debacle of Mullivaaikkal? ?
In that context the evolution and growth of the Great Heroes day event makes an interesting study. This writer has in the past written several articles on the topic. This article therefore draws liberally from his earlier writings. Let me begin by tracing in brief the history of this event.?
?
KAMBARMALAI SATHIYANATHAN ALIAS ?SHANKAR?
The first ever LTTE member to embrace death in combat was Sathiyanathan of Kambarmalai a northern village adjacent to Valvettithurai, the birthplace of Prabakharan, its leader. Sathiyanathan alias Shankar also known as Suresh died on November 27, 1982. ?
Incidently, the Sea Tiger special commander Thillaiambalam Sivanesan alias Soosai was married to Shankar?s sister. Soosai is from Poligandy, a coastal village in Vadamaratchy sector. Although Soosai is no more, his wife and children were captured by the Sri Lankan Navy when trying to escape from the Wanni by boat during the last days of the war. The family is now living in Trincomalee under a restricted release order. ? Shankar, like Raveendran alias Pandithar, -- also of Kambarmalai -- was a childhood friend of Prabakharan and one of his earliest recruits. Shankar had gone to Nithiyanandan?s residence in Navalar Road, Jaffna to warn them of a military crackdown on Tamil professionals and intellectuals suspected of being sympathetic towards the LTTE. ?
Even as Shankar was communicating with Jaffna University Lecturer Muthiah Nithiyanandan and his wife Nirmala, an ex-varsity lecturer who was teaching at a leading Girls School, a posse of soldiers surrounded the house. Shankar managed to shoot his way out of the military cordon but sustained serious injuries in the process. The Nithiyanandans were arrested.?
?
The custom of paying homage to heroes fallen in battle became non-existent in an environment where war was virtually unknown for generations. Now the LTTE went back to the roots of the Tamil martial culture and revived its most potent symbolic and ritual form. From 1991, the entire week from November 21-27, was declared as Great Heroes Week
?
?
THALAYASINGHAM SIVAKUMAR ALIAS??ANTON MASTER?
Later Shankar?s condition deteriorated and another senior LTTE member Thalayasingham Sivakumar alias Anton master who later represented the Tigers at the Thimphu talks undertook a perilous, clandestine journey by boat along with the injured Shankar to Tamil Nadu to procure urgent medical assistance for the latter. This was in the pre1983 period when the LTTE consisted only of around 25 to 30 full-time activists and had very few resources, including even wireless communication equipment. ?
Leaving the grievously injured Shankar in a safe house at Kodiaakkarai, on the coast, Anton went up to Madurai where LTTE chief Prabakharan and some others were staying then. This was the time when Prabakharan was confined by court order to Madurai because of his involvement in a broad daylight shoot out with Peoples Liberation Organisation of Tamil Eelam (PLOTE) chief Uma Maheswaran at Pondy Bazaar in Chennai (then Madras). Thanks to the help rendered by Pazhaniappan Nedumaran, who was then a member of the Tamil Nadu Legislative assembly representing Madurai West, Shankar was brought to a farmhouse belonging to Nedumaran for medical treatment. ?
The people nursing Shankar in the coastal hideout had ignorantly given a lot of water to quench his thirst. This worsened his condition to a point of no return. Shankar died in Madurai on Prabakharan?s lap mumbling ?Thambi, Thambi? (thambi was the endearing term by which Prabakharan was known in the old days), while the visibly shaken and weeping LTTE leader kept stroking his hair. This was one of the few occasions when the latter ever wept in public. Death in combat of a cadre whether immediate or subsequent was a new phenomenon to the LTTE on that day. ?
Seven years later, in 1989, around 600 LTTE cadres assembled at a secret venue in the Mullaitheevu district jungles of Nithikaikulam on November 27. The occasion was the newly-proclaimed Great Heroes Day or Maaveerar Naal as known in Tamil. This was the time when the Indian Army was fighting the LTTE on behalf of the Sri Lankan government. Thanks to the understanding arrived at between the LTTE and then President Ranasinghe Premadasa, a ceasefire had been declared on September 21, that year. ? A withdrawal of troops had been announced in principle. The Indian Parliamentary elections scheduled for December 1989 would determine whether Rajiv Gandhi would be re-elected or not. That verdict would in turn decide the fate of the Indian Army in Sri Lanka. The LTTE leader had in the meantime thought of honouring his dead cadres by observing a unique ceremony called Maaveerar Naal or Great Heroes Day. ?
The LTTE leader was proud then of the performance of his organisation in having withstood the onslaught of 132,000 troops of the Indian Army. When the Indo-Lanka accord was signed and hostilities ceased, the LTTE had lost 632 cadres in battle. When a cessation of hostilities with the Indian Army was enforced the LTTE had lost a further 711 cadres. Prabakharan wanted to recognise their contribution, honour their sacrifices and pay tribute to their memory in a collective manner. What better way than promulgating a special day? Which better day than the date on which the first LTTE member laid down his life? So November 27 it was.
?
The primary ceremony however was at the site in which Prabakharan himself participated. A newly constructed memorial was the usual venue
?
HISTORIC PRONOUNCEMENT
The first Great Heroes Day was a restricted affair of which the highlight was a highly emotional address delivered extemporaneously by Prabakharan to his enraptured followers. It was at this meeting that Prabakharan uttered his historic pronouncement ?If ever Prabakharan betrays the Tamil Eelam cause, you all must kill me?. ? This writer saw the video cassette in which the event was recorded. Prabakharan was tracing the history of the LTTE while enraptured cadres listened. At one point, he stated that Tamil United Liberation Front (TULF) Leader Appapillai Amirthalingam was killed by the LTTE. ?Amirthalingam had supported Tamil Eelam at one time but later betrayed it. That was why we killed him. Tomorrow, if Prabakharan betrays the Tamil Eelam cause, then you all must kill me. Whoever betrays Tamil Eelam must be killed? the Tiger supremo pronounced then. Subsequently this ?scene? was edited out of the video cassette that was widely circulated among the Diaspora. ?
The 1990s of the last century saw the LTTE controlling the greater part of the northern province and substantial pockets in the eastern province. During this period, the LTTE developed to a great extent, the ceremonial aspect of paying homage to its fallen heroes. ?
There existed in the martial tradition of the Tamils a concept known as Nadugal Valipaadu which literally meant worshipping the planted stone. Tombstones were erected at the graves of great heroes fallen in battle. These were honoured regularly through special Panegyric rituals.The classical Tamil literary works of the Sangham era are replete with references to this Nadugal Valipaadu concept. ?
The decline of Tamil dynasties along with the advent of Moghul and Nayakkar rule followed by European colonialism saw the martial tradition among Tamils becoming debilitated. The custom of paying homage to heroes fallen in battle became non-existent in an environment where war was virtually unknown for generations. Now the LTTE went back to the roots of the Tamil martial culture and revived its most potent symbolic and ritual form. From 1991, the entire week from November 21-27, was declared as Great Heroes Week. Interestingly the birthday of Prabakharan was November 26. Since this day was now within the Great Heroes Week more importance was attached to it. ?
An outpouring of emotion, both genuine as well as sycophantic emerged. Gradually the focus shifted from Great Heroes Day to the leader?s birthday. Some even thought that Great Heroes day was to celebrate the leaders birthday. Soon Prabakharan acted firmly and clamped down all festive activity connected with his birthday. The week was for the fallen heroes and the red letter day of that week would only be November 27, the Great Heroes Day he decreed. Nevertheless, various religious observances were undertaken by followers and well wishers on November 26, seeking divine protection and blessings on the man who supposedly personified Tamil resistance to Sinhala chauvinist hegemony.?
?
The most touching spectacle of the great heroes day observance was the mass participation of family members at these cemeteries and memorial pavilions. Later G. H. D. ceremonies were observed in foreign cities where substantial concentrations of the Tamil Diaspora lived
?
GREAT HEROES WEEK
Utilising its control to the maximum of the north and parts of the east during the 1990-1995 period, the LTTE conducted elaborate demonstrations and events as part of observing the ?Maaveerar Naal? and ?Maaveerar Vaaram? (Great Heroes Week). The week culminated in a grand function on the 27th at a special location attended by Prabakharan himself. With the passage of time, the GHD ceremonies became decentralised. Several observances would be conducted simultaneously but pride of place however was naturally awarded to the one in which Prabakharan participated. The LTTE also established several cemeteries called ?Maaveerar Thuyilum Illangal? (abodes where the great heroes slumber). Each of the departed cadres was marked by a single tombstone. In most cases, the actual body of the dead cadre was not buried at the spot. Most bodies of dead cadres -- if and when recovered -- were disposed of with honours at the area of combat itself. While these tombstones were laid out in neat rows, a pavilion commemorating them collectively with names and relevant dates was also constructed. ?
The most touching spectacle of the great heroes day observance was the mass participation of family members at these cemeteries and memorial pavilions. Later G. H. D. ceremonies were observed in foreign cities where substantial concentrations of the Tamil Diaspora lived. ?
The security forces have demolished many of these ?abodes? after seizing territory from the Tigers. These types of action by the security forces have been condemned by many who felt the dead must be respected notwithstanding they were enemy fighters. Also the families of the cadres and relatives would be hurt and angered it was felt. ?
What must be taken note of is that the LTTE never commemorated or mourned the loss of Tamils who belonged to other Tamil militant movements. The sectarian LTTE did not regard others as fallen heroes. Only LTTE cadres were given that recognition. Families of dead cadres belonging to other movements were not allowed to mourn their loved ones publicly. They could only mourn in private. ?
As the ethnic conflict kept continuing, the casualty rates also increased. This meant that more and more Tamil families were suffering the losses of their loved ones and becoming grief stricken. Gradually the event became large scale and mass oriented. ?
This column has witnessed Great Heroes Day ceremonies held overseas as well as films of functions in Sri Lankan Tamil areas. There is no doubt that the sight of grief stricken emotional outpourings over their loved ones by family members was a profoundly moving one. The families of fallen LTTE cadres were called ?Maaveerar Kudumbangal?(Great hero families) and were often given preferential treatment in spheres that came within the ambit of LTTE control.
?
MEMORY AND MARTYRDOM
The LTTE by nurturing this cult of martyrdom achieved many things. It provided those cadres among the living a bond of affiliation with their departed comrades. The cadres got a feeling of reassuring comfort that he or she too would be honoured in similar fashion when dead. The LTTE cadres had fought and died in the belief that posterity would remember and honour their memory and martyrdom. ?
The GHD observances provided them with the feeling that by sacrificing their lives they would grasp eternity and ensure immortality. Likewise the kith and kin of the departed souls too were gratified that the loss of their loved one has not been in vain. The emotive content of GHD observances also motivated other youths to join the LTTE. The spectacle also inspired the general population in continuing to appreciate the LTTE sacrifices and render support. ? The annual great heroes day address by the LTTE leader began to assume great significance and importance over the years. Since Prabakharan was quite reclusive and shunned direct media exposure the GHD appearance became one of those rare occasions where he interacted with the public.?
The annual speech was also considered to be something akin to a policy statement by the LTTE. It was dissected by analysts to ascertain what the LTTE leader envisaged for the immediate future. In later years, Prabakharan did not deliver extempore but read from a carefully prepared text usually written by LTTE political adviser Anton Stanislaus Balasingham alias Bala annai. ?
The setting up of the LTTE?s own radio station ?Puligalin Kural? (Voice of Tigers) enabled it to be relayed out. With the development of information technology, the speech was later relayed simultaneously via Internet. The LTTE also had its own ?Nitharsanam? TV and GHD proceedings were telecast to the world at large from the Wanni. The emergence of several Tamil broadcasting stations in the western world created a situation where the speech was heard in Tamil homes throughout Europe, Australia and North America. Likewise the acquisition of various television stations by pro-Tiger Tamils enabled wide televised coverage too. ?
The GHD observances were multi-faceted and diversified. The highlight of the ceremonies was the lighting of candles and torches by those assembled.While people holding these flickering lights lined up and formed an illuminated corridor, a glowing torch was brought in relay form by LTTE cadres in similar fashion to that of the Olympic games.
?
FLAME OF SACRIFICE
The flaming torch was then given to the chief guest who then lit a large eternal flame known as Eegai Chudar (Flame of sacrifice) at the Memorial monument. This was followed by the lighting of a myriad lamps and torches making the occasion a festival of lights. Several senior LTTE figures were chief guests at different ceremonies.The flames at various memorials were lit by senior tiger stalwarts. All the ceremonies were attended by members of great hero families taken by procession to the various memorials from different spots. Music was played by troupes from different LTTE formations. The different venues were also decorated with pandals.The red and yellow flags were hoisted widely. ?
The primary ceremony however was at the site in which Prabakharan himself participated. A newly constructed memorial was the usual venue. After the LTTE flag was hoisted a display demonstration by selected squads from various units of the LTTE was held. A march past was held after which Prabakharan accepted the ceremonial salute. Prabakharan then began his address at 6. 05 pm the time that Shankar breathed his last. The speech was usually about 30 to 40 minutes. ?
Prabakharan thereafter accepted the flaming torch brought in relay form and went on to light the premier flame of sacrifice. After observing two minutes of silence along with the massive crowd in attendance, the LTTE leader garlands a picture of Sathiyanathan alias Shankar, the first great hero. Thereafter the LTTE leader accompanied by other Tiger members lit the small lamps and placed flowers before the pictures of martyrs. ?
This then is the history behind the GHD significance. So great was the importance attached to the day that the LTTE opened a special office in Kilinochhi to handle the event as well as affairs concerning dead LTTE cadres and families. A retired educationist Pon.Thiyagam was in charge of this office. He is now living outside Sri Lanka.
It is against this backdrop that the currently prevalent Maaveerar Naal mystique must be viewed. LTTE and pro-LTTE elements within the Diaspora think it is their ?historic duty? (varalaatrukkadamai) to commemorate the event on November 27. Even though the war has ended and the LTTE is no more in Sri Lanka, the Tiger and pro-Tiger sections of the Global Tamil Diaspora continue to commemorate the event worldwide. Given the demise of Prabhakaran and defeat of the Tigers in the Island, it remains to be seen whether the overseas LTTE can sustain the same vigour and interest in the GHD in the years to come.
?
OVERSEAS TIGERS
Currently however, the GHD concept remains potent and valid amidst the Diaspora. The overseas Tigers and fellow travellers though deeply divided have seized upon the event to test and demonstrate their popular support as well as generate more funds by exploiting people emotionally. Such has been the significance, relevance and importance of the Great Heroes Day to the LTTE in the past that any suspicion of a potential revival of the practice in Sri Lanka sends alarm bells ringing in security circles. ?
In a bid perhaps to reduce security related apprehensions, Cabinet Minister and Colombo District MP Mano Ganesan suggested that Tamils in the north could observe great heroes day without mentioning the LTTE.That however would be difficult to do because the Great Heroes Day is a Tiger event and is inextricably inter-twined with that of the LTTE. Attempting to observe ? Maaveera Naal ? without mentioning the ?Viduthalaip Puligal? would be akin to relating the Ramayana tale without mentioning the name of Lord Rama. ?
Notwithstanding brazen efforts by vested interests to depict ?Maaveerar Naal? falling on November 27, as a day of general Tamil mourning, it must be emphasised that the so-called ?Great Heroes Day? is not and has never been a national day of Tamil mourning. The ?Maaveerar Naal? was an intensely conducted partisan event ?of the Tigers, for the Tigers and by the Tigers?. To portray it otherwise as some have done including stalwarts of the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) is sheer political hypocrisy. ?
The role played by sections of the Tamil National Alliance in promoting the Great Heroes concept within the current milieu has been considerable. During its Northern Provincial Council polls campaign in 2013, the TNA observed a two- minute silence in honour of the?Maaveerar?. At that meeting, some TNA candidates praised LTTE leaders and described them as Great Heroes. Chief among these was the TNA?s chief ministerial candidate. The TNA-controlled Pradeshiya Sabhas of Karaichchi and Chavakachcheri passed resolutions calling for renovation of LTTE cemeteries.The Northern PC, upon taking office conducted a tree planting campaign on November 27 2013. Subsequent years saw ceremonies in Mullivaaikkal with Wigneswaran lighting a flame like Prabhakaran in the past. Some TNA councillors lit lamps privately and publicised it via internet as a public event to delude the Diaspora. This year?s Great Heroes day saw TNA Jaffna district MP E. Saravanabavan, Northern Provincial Minister Aingaranesan, NPC M.K.Sivajilingam and Ananthy Sasitharan participate at Maaveerar Naal events in Jaffna.
?
POLITICS OF MOURNING
The conduct of the TNA regarded widely as a ?moderate?political formation adds to the threat perception of the State regarding the GHD. What is disgusting about the politics of mourning adopted by the TNA was the scale of political hypocrisy! The LTTE now hailed as ?Great Heroes? has in the past killed hundreds of Tamils who belonged to the constituent partners of the present TNA configuration. The TNA, as a single political entity, is yet to publicly mourn their comrades and colleagues slain by the LTTE. Yet some TNA leaders display no qualms about celebrating fallen Tigers as great heroes. ?
What is worse is the deceitful manner in which Tamil political leaders and sections of the media foster the myth that November 27 is a date of Overall Tamil sorrow and that Maaveerar Naal is a day of national mourning for the Tamils. This does not mean that Tamils do not mourn the loss of their loved ones. They do! ?
The Tamils have lost those dear and near to them in the communal violence of 1956, 1958, 1977, 1981 and 1983. They have suffered innumerable losses in many forms during the long years of the war. There cannot be a single Tamil living who has not suffered the loss of a loved one during the years of violence and war. What is unacceptable, however, is the deception to depict the ?Maaveerar Naal? as a day of universal Tamil mourning. ?
November 27, therefore, remains an important date in the politics of mourning in which Tiger and pro-Tiger elements indulge in. It would however be a grave blunder to assume that the ?Maaveerar Naal? of the LTTE is a day of National mourning for the Tamils of Sri Lanka. ?

Gunaratnam granted two months visa
	
Kumar Gunaratnam - the controversial political activist holding an Australian citizenship - who was released yesterday after completing his prison term has been granted a two-month visa to submit his application for a citizenship in Sri Lankan, the Daily Mirror learns.
The Department of Immigration and Emigration yesterday issued a visa for two months for Gunaratnam?s Australian Passport bearing the name Noel Mudalige to remain in the country until February 2, 2017, immigration sources said.
The department received a visa application from the members of the Frontline Socialist Party on Thursday following the revelation made by Internal Affairs Minister S B Navinna at Parliament that Gunaratnam could get Sri Lankan Citizenship if he renounces his Australian citizenship.
FSP representatives of Gunaratnam who submitted a visa application for the latter on Thursday also collected a Sri Lanka citizenship application from the Immigration authorities saying that they would return the completed form on Monday, sources said.
A senior officer at the department disclosed that Gunaratnam will have to submit his application for the citizenship in Sri Lanka before the expiry of the two-month visa.
Once the application is received, as per the procedure the department will obtain a security clearance report from the State Intelligence Service (SIS) on the particular applicant?s history.
In the meantime relevant documents will be processed within the department with the consent of the Ministry of Internal Affairs to grant the citizenship to the applicant. Once this is done three more months will be given to the applicant to renounce his foreign citizenship.
When the applicant submits proof that his foreign citizenship is renounced the local authorities will get the final consent of the Minister of Internal Affairs who would approve the certificate of Sri Lankan citizenship to the applicant.
However, in Gunaratnam?s case he could have easily obtained a dual citizenship status to live either in Sri Lanka or Australia under the dual citizenship programme. But it was evident that Gunaratnam was insisting on obtaining only Sri Lankan citizenship and would ready to give up the other at any given point, if the Government is ready to grant him citizenship.
A Sri Lankan dual citizenship holder enjoys all the civil rights a regular citizen would enjoy including the right to vote and even to contest in an election for a provincial council.
The only right a Sri Lankan dual citizenship holder would deprive of is that he or she could not contest in any Parliamentary election. (Kurulu Koojana Kariyakarawana)

IGP?s Sir could be anybody: Kiriella
	
Anura K asks Law and Order Minister to reveal who the ?Sir? is
The controversial cellular phone call to the Police Chief could have been from anybody, House Leader and Minister Lakshman Kiriella told Parliament yesterday.
He said this when Chief Opposition Whip and JVP MP Anura Kumara Dissanayake asked whom the Police Chief was addressing as 'Sir' while answering a cellular phone call he received during an event on the previous day.
?I raised this matter on Thursday but I did not receive an answer. Law and Order Minister should reveal to Parliament whom the Police Chief was addressing as 'Sir'," he said.
"One 'Sir' instructed him not to arrest a Dishan Wickramaratne Gunasekara," the MP said.
"The parliament has a right to know about it. Dishan Gunasekara was the former Basnayake Nilame, a close relative of VVIP family connected to the previous regime. He was also the former acting director and chairman of the Ceylon Mineral Sands Corporation. There are several cases filed against him by the FCID. We want to know whether it is the minister who instructed the IGP not to arrest Mr. Gunasekera. What I believe is that for the IGP the 'Sir' can either be the minister related to the Police or the Prime Minister. So the relevant minister should reveal to the Parliament as to who instructed the IGP not to arrest Dishan."
Mr. Kiriella said the MP is only interpreting an incident and the government is not prepared to answer questions which are based on interpretations.
?The person whom IGP addressed as 'Sir' could be anyone as school teachers are also called Sir. I still call my school teacher sir,? the minister said.? (Yohan Perera)

A strong plea has gone out from the organizers of ?Little Hearts? of the premier Lady Ridgeway Hospital for Children (LRH) in Borella to carry out ?A till-donation campaign would be held by Little Hearts Unit of the Colombo Lady Ridgeway Hospital for Children on Sunday, December 4.
The organisers have set out a strong plea to the general public to donate generously.?
The LRH provides treatment free of charge to children from all districts in the country. However, when dealing with heart diseases and critical illnesses, it is not in a position to provide timely and appropriate treatment to all children in need, a spokesperson of the hospital said.?
?We urge Principals and teachers to encourage the children in their educational institutions to donate their tills for the worthy cause of saving critically-ill children,? the spokesperson said.
?This would also set an example for adults to follow suit.
?All these contributions will help put up a 10-storey building costing Rs. 2 billion, to provide appropriate treatment to the children of Sri Lanka, while helping to end the struggles of needy parents who have to collect money at bus stands or publish newspaper advertisements for their children?s heart surgeries or critical illness.
?Please encourage children to donate their tills at the LRH which is the main collecting centre on Sunday from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. or at any other Bank of Ceylon (BOC) branch during the following week,? the spokesperson said.
