A clash of Titans again
	

There is a tug-o-war going on over the appointment of a chair of a powerful commission handling the countrys finances, they say.

Number One in yahapalanaya has reportedly nominated a high-up attached to his own office as a consultant for this office. Meanwhile, Number Two has nominated a big gun in the countrys economic sector.
The nominee of Number One is said to be a bigwig in a key economic body and an author of a treatise on the subject to boot.
Th one nominated by Number Two is described as a person who has gained much practical knowledge on the subject having functioned in key positions in several financial institutions.
With the countrys top two nominating two persons for the post, the appointing authority had found himself in a quandary.
However, Number Twos nominee is going to be the final choice, they say.

After all, he has got his prize
	

This Diyawanna member, once an associate of Prince Panchaudha, took political refuge in the Compassionate One on the eve of the lastmini-polls.

Later he became a star speaker at the Blue party poll rallies and after the polls were over, he requested that he be raised to the status of a governing one in a province; however, his request went unheeded.
Meanwhile, some members from the Panchaudha group had heard that their erstwhile pal had after all struck gold - in the form of a coconut estate in Wayamba worth Rs.30 million! Now set to go to town with the story, the Panchaudha faithfuls are said to be, nevertheless, perusing documents at a registry to double-check whether the new owner of this estate is a bald headed one familiar to them.

Champikas stance on 20A is no concern of ours: JVP
	
The Janatha Vimukthi Peramnua (JVP) MP Sunil Hadunnetti said yesterday they were not concerned about Minister Patali Champika Ranawakas stance on the 20th Amendment to the Constitution because his stance from the beginning had been to retain the executive presidency.
He told Daily Mirror that they respected Mr. Ranawaka for revealing his stance clearly on the executive presidency and added that it was pointless talking to him on the matter.
He is someone who supports the executive presidency. He is the only one who opposed the 17th Amendment to the Constitution, Mr. Handunnetti said and added that those who did not respect democratic values were supporters of dictatorship.
Mr. Ranawaka is dreaming of becoming a dictator. There are people who wish for dictators like Hitler, he said. (Ajith Siriwardana)

Colombos public toilets struggling to stay clean
	
Using a wet, unclean toilet sans basic facilities can certainly be an unpleasant experience. Sri Lanka, as a developing country, still has to go a long way in terms of upgrading various facilities, one being sanitary needs. When it comes to sanitation, it includes everything from sewage facilities to drinking water. One main concern among daily commuters is the dirty state of public toilets. Toilets in fact made headlines recently when Colombos Mayoress exposed the budget allocations to refurbish her official residence. A media report initially stated that Rs. 5.7 million was allocated to refurbish toilets at her official residence, but she reiterated the fact that a sum of Rs. 5.2 million had been allocated to preserve the archaeological value of her official residence. Following this, the sheds light on the state of several public toilets in Colombo and thoughts from commuters. 
None of these toilets had toilet paper, tissue or hand-wash
	The CMC has completely renovated close to 17 toilet units
	Its important to educate people on using toilets
	The CMC has a team of district engineers who inspect these toilets weekly
Always wet, always stinksRecently the dropped in at several public toilets situated in Fort, Galle Face, Gunasinghapura and Havelock Town and discovered that almost all of them were wet. People using some of these toilets had forgotten to flush their evidence and even to close the taps in these facilities. In some of these toilets the doors didnt close properly and were tied with strings. A nominal fee of Rs. 20 is charged from users, but the authorities maintaining the Fort Public Toilets charge Rs 20 despite the notice stating that the fee is Rs. 10. Every other toilet also charges the same rate. Especially at the Galle Face toilet, there was a bad stench which clearly gave signs of poor maintenance. These toilets also had no commode seat or a hand shower except for a tap and a bucket in the left hand corner. These toilets were also wet. None of these toilets had toilet paper, tissue and hand-wash. Certain personal hygiene products were carelessly thrown into the dustbins adding to the unpleasantness. 
Shortage of manpower
Speaking to the CMCs Director of Engineering Works A.C.M Fazal said that the CMC has completely renovated close to 17 toilet units with state-of-the-art facilities. Although the establishment of these units is under the Colombo Municipal Council they are being outsourced. Therefore theres a nominal charge when people use these toilets. Especially toilets in the Colombo North area have been abandoned for years because people have started building their own toilets and nobody uses public toilets. Although they are abandoned the CMC has to bear the electricity and water bills and eventually public toilets become a liability.
Theres also a shortage of manpower and therefore we thought it was best to outsource them. We have identified seven more locations to establish public toilets and we are introducing toilets which could be used by differently-abled persons as well. We also want to ensure the safety of users and therefore we are in the process of building separate toilets for gents and ladies. If there are any complaints we have a team of district engineers who weekly inspect these toilets. They file a report and identify any missing equipment and shortages. This way we are able to keep them up-to-date and in a usable condition, he said. 
These toilets were also wet. None of these toilets had toilet paper, tissue and hand-wash. Certain personal hygiene products were carelessly thrown into the dustbins adding to the unpleasantness
Children not using school toilets
When contacted Dr.Deepal Perera, Consultant Paediatrician at the Lady Ridgeway Hospital, said that due to unhygienic conditions in toilets, people have a tendency to develop various health problems. They could end up having skin infections and viruses. When it comes to children they sometimes dont drink water and also dont use the school toilets. This in turn would lead to kidney problems and if the water isnt filtered it may even lead to conditions such as diarrhea. Therefore its important to educate people on using toilets, so that its in a state where the next person can use. said Dr. Perera.

DEMOCRACY  OR HYPOCRISY
	
Who bearsthe burden
Since our forefathers, the founding fathers of democracy passed on, the country has been gradually reduced to a state of hypocrisy!!! The system of being a democracy favouring social equality has been systematically eroded!!! With the onset of the Eelam War, the system of democracy that we cherished was torn apart!!! With that came a terrible fear psychosis; no one was safe, yet life went on!!! For over three decades, people never knew when they went out in the morning, if they would come back in the evening!!! The danger to life was untenable!!! Regardless of all this, the country continued to be governed!!! Today, all we hear of are shuffles, shuffling and reshuffling; to the extent that one of the Mahanayakes observed that the Ministers do not know what is expected of them because they have hardly begun to deal with one portfolio when a different one is thrust on them!!! Why this uncertainty and inability to give correct guidance so that the country will be governed as it should be WHY Because the focus is not on governance, but on which country to visit next, which turnaround of portfolios would be personally beneficial and other matters not relevant to governance!!! Price hikes have gone through; petrol, diesel, resulting in bus fare hikes, trishaw meters starting at Rs. 60/- and absolute chaos!!! Who bears the burden of all this The common man of course!!!
Nato - No Action, Talk Only
In addition we now have to contend with STORMS, NOT STORMS IN TEACUPS, BUT REAL STORMS THAT HAVE RESULTED IN FLOODING, LEAVING THOUSANDS HOMELESS!!! LET US HOLD FOR A MINUTE, DIDNT OUR ERSTWHILE PRESIDENT PROMISE THAT WHEN WE DID NOT HAVE A MONSOON TO COPE WITH, ALL THE RESERVOIRS WOULD BE CLEANED, SO THAT WATER COULD BE STORED!!! WHAT HAPPENED TO THE CLEANING OF THE DAMS THIS IS A CLASSIC CASE OF NATO [NO ACTION, TALK ONLY!!!] Looking at RAMADAN, the Prime Minister said the Muslims were to be given ALL THE DATES [fruits needed for breaking fast] THEY NEEDED!!! PERHAPS THEY WERE ONLY BLIND DATES; that is why my Muslim friends tell me that they have neither received nor seen a SINGLE DATE so far!!! In addition, they complain that the ALL IMPORTANT MUSLIM FESTIVAL OF RAMAZAN is overlooked by the Government and they only get holidays for HAJ and Prophet Muhammads birthday, but RAMAZAN, WHICH IS THE MOST IMPORTANT IN THE MUSLIM CALENDAR, IS FORGOTTEN!!! They rightly ask what the Muslim Ministers are doing in Parliament, if they do not have the guts to fight for this all important holiday!!!
Alladin the wonderful human

Conversely, and as opposed to all the inhumanity that we Sri Lankans are exposed to all the days of our lives, there are still some GOOD, DECENT PEOPLE AROUND; like Alladin, the sweep ticket seller from Digana!!! An old lady had won 20 lakhs through her ticket and she very trustingly took her ticket to Alladin!!! When Alladin realized the quantum of money she had won, he very kindly told the Policeman standing by to be good enough to escort the lady to her home, stopped a trishaw and made sure she was safely sent to her home!!! This is something so contrary to what the average Sri Lankan would do. It shocked the old lady out of her wits!!! Most Sri Lankans are only hell bent on stealing and they dont care from whom!!! But, as I said earlier, there are still SOME GOOD PEOPLE AROUND IN OUR COUNTRY!!! The old lady did not even know how much she had won!!!
Locating Arjuna Mahendran is like searching MH17!

Sri Lanka has gone through countless changes of Government. However, unlike at the beginning, most of the 21st century Parliamentarians have to account for many murders!!! Not the present regime, but anyone who stood in the way of the previous regime was eliminated!!! The present regime must account for the damage to the economy of the country, particularly by the Central Bank and those that they put in charge!!! Their inability to do anything about the woeful state of the economy is akin to their not being able to find ARJUN MAHENDRAN when he is right under their noses!!! WHAT IS THE TRUTH HERE WE HAVE ASKED BEFORE AND WE ASK AGAIN, IS IT THAT THEY CANNOT FIND MAHENDRAN OR DO NOT WANT TO FIND HIM!!! THAT SEEMS CLOSER TO THE TRUTH!!! IS THERE NO PUNISHMENT THAT CAN BE METED OUT TO THIS MAN Looking for Arjuna Mahendran is the same as looking for the Malaysian MH17 aircraft that vanished!!! Murders and abductions continue to remain unsolved and the terrible crimes that were committed in the unlawful acquisition of lands and wealth in the previous regime are yet to be resolved!!! The perpetrators have got away and will continue to do so; they are laughing at the absolute incongruity of it all!!! The burning question here is ARE THOSE IN CHARGE NOW INCAPABLE OR, MORE CORRECTLY, ARE THEY AFRAID WILL WE EVER KNOW
More reforms within UNP next week
We are told that with the prevailing storms, the Diyawanna Oya is going under!!! With the current Members of Parliament that Parliament is housing today, is it any wonder that the House of Parliament is going under!!! They are not men of integrity, honesty or inherent decency!!! Therefore, the structure housing Parliament must collapse with the weight of their perfidy, their treachery even though they are cushioned in the hallowed halls of democracy - Parliament!!! Now we hear that the UNP is going to bring about more reforms next week!!! Are they actually telling us that THEY ARE AWARE THAT THE PARTY NEEDS A COMPLETE OVERHAUL - A TRANSFORMATION That the young ones have to shoulder and rectify the glaring mistakes because the present regime does not seem to be able to do anything about it There is so much chaos, so much division, so many cut-throat activities that we wonder if the MANEL and OLU FLOWERS will ever bloom in the Diyawanna Oya again!!! Those beautiful flowers may not be able to bloom because they will be throttled and ruined by the treachery of those who inhabit that hallowed place!!! A former sporty one is battling only a 100 million take; while a Kalutara district one claimed a snake bite on the way to Court and ended up in hospital!!! SO MANY TAKERS, MOVERS AND SHAKERS, WITH A YOUNG ONE OF THE FORMER REGIME NONCHALANTLY SHOWING V SIGNS EACH TIME HE COMES OUT OF THE FCID!!! I have done no wrong, is what we are being told!!! Where are we heading With SO MANY TAKERS, THERE MAY NOT BE ENOUGH SNAKES AROUND TO CONVENIENTLY BITE THEM ALL!!! We live in a world of declining moral values, but no where are they being tinkered and tampered with to the detriment of society as in this country of ours!!! THE ABSOLUTE HORROR IS THAT WRONGS SEEM TO BE REWARDED!!! Perhaps it would be good if those in power realize that the only time SUCCESS comes before WORK is in the Dictionary.

Duterte will go to war if China crosses red lines, Philippine FM
	

(rt.co), 29 May, 2018
Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte is ready to go to war with Beijing if it crosses red lines and unilaterally claims natural resources in the disputed South China Sea, the countrys foreign minister has warned.
The Philippines will go to war to protect its rights in the South China Sea, Philippine Foreign Affairs Secretary Alan Peter Cayetano noted, somewhat contradicting President Rodrigo Dutertes policy of avoiding any confrontation with their neighbor.
If anyone gets the natural resources in the West Philippine Sea, he [Duterte] will go to war, Cayetano said on Monday.
Cayetano repeated, outlining red lines amid a simmering territorial dispute with Beijing, which continues to ignore the 2016 international arbitration ruling that said there was no legal basis for China to claim historic rights in the South China Sea.

Finally, he had to deny what was correct
	

When Number One found that a large regiment was getting ready to accompany a certain purohita due to leave for an international conference held overseas, he pruned the number by a one-third.

The pruning of the ministerial entourage received much media publicity. However, by this time the purohita and his better half had already left the country.
When this news reached the purohita now abroad, it was his better half who went into a flutter.
She immediately contacted the purohita at the state level and asked him to lose no time in issuing a media communique correcting the news reports.
The state level purohita asked his aides to issue a clarification to media signed by his secretary.
When the secretary saw the clarification put up for his signature, he had declined to sign it saying that the media was correct and it was he himself who got the pruning order from Number One.
Nevertheless, the media release was issued, but it was Ministrys media officer who had signed it, they say.

Focus 2018: A sustainable and innovative approach to protect the Ocean
	
Protecting the environment is a responsibility vested upon everyones shoulders. As natural resources including wildlife are facing threats of extinction the need for conservation is greatly felt. In such a backdrop it is important to protect what is around us, by saving a tree or two or disposing garbage in a responsible manner in order to make sure that we at least receive the oxygen we breathe. The ocean is a valuable resource that all Sri Lankans have and protecting it is a major need of the hour. 
The ocean is a valuable resource that all Sri Lankans have and protecting it is a major need of the hour
	Coastal wealth offers enormous protection for the blue economic growth of nations
	Livelihoods of up to 12% of the worlds population come from the ocean
In an attempt to spearhead this herculean task and promote the concept of Blue Economy the Embassy of France in Sri Lanka and the Maldives and its partners - Biodiversity Sri Lanka, MIND, IUCN, the French Development Agency, the Bandaranaike Centre for International Studies and the Alliance Franaise de Kotte in Colombo - organized a high level seminar to raise awareness followed by the signing of a Declaration of Intent between the two countries. During this seminar a document of Expression of Interest was also signed among several companies in the private sector to support a project on coastal management and Blue Economy in the region of Vakarai-Batticaloa. 
Marine resources are assets to sustainable economic development: Ambassador
In his opening remarks, Ambassador of France to Sri Lanka and Maldives Jean Marin-Schuh said that this years focus will be on oceans protection and blue economy. Everybody knows that oceans are more polluted in the world today. Plastic, litter and water pollution are a global challenge that every country faces. Sri Lanka being an island nation is particularly exposed to these threats. It is home to an exceptional biodiversity and resources with challenges in terms of coastal development. France has a lot to share with Sri Lanka in terms of blue economy.
Having the second largest exclusive economic zone in the world we believe that marine resources are assets to sustainable economic development. France supports environmental protection and climate change issues. Hence we are glad to cooperate with Sri Lanka on oceans management and blue economy. Therefore the French Development Agency is particularly active in Sri Lanka in order to promote sustainable development and blue economy. France can also share knowledge and expertise in terms of academic research. Hence, we will sign a bilateral Declaration of Intent. The objective of Focus 2018 is to create an understanding among all stakeholders to trust and support a complete conservation project. This project is the achievement of a remarkable collaboration between the private and public sectors.
Over 60% of the high seas are common property and are shared by everyone: Prof. Munasinghe
In his comments Vice Chair of the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, co-laureate of the Nobel Prize Prof. Mohan Munasinghe said that the specific role here is to lead the effort in the applied research area in relation to valuation of benefits that ocean resources provide. Thereafter we can formulate practical policies to manage those resources. Lets start by thinking about how life originated from the ocean which covers 2/3rds of the land surface. The ocean supported human life and ultimately shaped economic development. Coastal wealth offers enormous protection for the blue economic growth of nations. Livelihoods of up to 12% of the worlds population come from the ocean. Seafood accounts for USD 190 billion worth revenues marine and coastal tourism generates revenue of USD 161 billion. Yet human activities including over-fishing, pollution and climate change are critically harming these resources.
We must do more to protect and manage the ocean if we are to sustain even the current levels of ocean-based economic productions. We also can generate more jobs for billions of people. However over 60% of the high seas are common property and are shared by everyone. Free access to ocean resources and services put strong pressure on marine ecosystems greatly from over-fishing, reckless resource traction and other issues. Sustainable ocean management however will be a challenge as it will take time to coordinate the activities of over 190 countries. With a 1600 km coastline, Sri Lanka is surrounded by the sea while 55% of the population depends on these coastal resources. But the marine environment and resources contribute to less than 2% of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) although our territorial limits in the ocean cover eight times the land resources. The blue-green economy concept applied to our coastal zones seeks to promote economic growth, social inclusion and livelihoods while ensuring environmental sustainability. We have to harness highly productive ocean resources better. However there are major issues in the policy, regulatory and environmental fronts.
Speaking further Prof. Munasinghe said that the recent report of the Presidential Expert Committee on Sustainable Sri Lanka 2030 which is about to be released, highlights the development of the marine sector. In the report we have focused on marine pollution, plastics, agricultural and industrial run-off, and human waste and so on. Things such as ocean acidification due to the climate, marine debris, marine coastal resource degradation such as coral reefs and mangroves which are deteriorating, fish-catch dwindling near the shore and sustainable fishing methods need to be addressed. We also have huge problems with sustainable utilization and governance and this is where the resources come into play.
We need to prioritise which of these ocean resources are more important, who uses them and then value these resources both in monetary and biological terms and then we can identify the kinds of policies and measures that we can recommend to government, to business and other communities to manage these resources. The research element is very important and the Focus 2018 project correctly identifies the stretch of coastline from Vakarai to Batticaloa as a pilot project and support a concerted effort to improve resource management and conservation. On the scientific side we feel that it is important to understand the inter-linkages among the various ecosystems, services and the social and economic dynamics in the utilization of those resources. The public, civil and private sectors should be part of the project to enable a broader understanding of the scientific knowledge, to have greater ownership of the results and finally to implement practical policies that will help manage these resources.
More research needs to evaluate Vakarai coastal ecosystem: Nishan Perera
Airing his views regarding this topic, marine biologist and co-founder of Blue Resources Trust said that it was important to develop an initial concept of specific activity or a project which we wanted to take away beyond a policy framework.
One attempt was to integrate the private sector with government policies.We also looked at building partnerships among private sector companies and we wanted to focus on a specific coastal area. There are problems around the Sri Lankan coastal areas but we also want to try and focus on one specific area so that we could make an impact there and see some tangible results. We then developed a model that is both sustainable and can be replicated in other parts of the country. Initially we created a dialogue among academia, non-governmental agencies and also had a couple of meetings and workshops. We identified key policy areas and gaps in conservation issues we can address, then we evaluated several coastal areas around Sri Lanka based on their conservation value and what are the needs and interventions that we could bring in there. Thereafter we chose one coastal stretch and identified the main objectives we wanted to implement. The area we chose was Vakarai depending on the feedback of the participants. It is a diverse coastal area with a lot of coastal ecosystems and compared to other parts of the country it has healthy ecosystems.
Therefore we thought its important to bring in interventions and better management before things got worse. They have extensive lagoons, coral reefs, estuaries, mangrove habitats and the like. The Kayankerni coral reef is identified as one of the most resilient reefs to climate change impact. It has now been declared as a marine sanctuary by the Department of Wildlife including several other lagoons such as Batticaloa and Valachchenai. Currently there are several activities going on in the area as well. There are national programmes, private sector and NGO interventions going on in the area. We identified key stakeholders and activities taking place in the area and tried to see how we could improve it and identify certain gaps. The objective that we identified together with the other partners was to establish a reliable research database so that we could have more applied research in the area. More focus needs to be diverted towards social, environmental, habitat and species-based research in order evaluate the ecosystem. It is also important to develop livelihoods of coastal communities so that they could benefit and gather more awareness through that process.

## Title: From Good to Non Governance

From Good to Non Governance
	
Government of limited power need not be anaemic government. Assurance that rights are secure tends to diminish fear and jealousy of strong government, and by making us feel safe to live under it makes for its better support.
- Robert H. Jackson
Any government is under the obligation to govern its citizens; in fact it is the main duty of a government. A government which is either unable or unwilling to govern is like a fisherman who refuses or is unable to fish. The fact that there are fish all around and the man is equipped with a fishing rod does not automatically make him a fisher. That is how the present government of this republic can be perceived; unwilling and unable to govern.
The State apparatus is what bestows the teeth to a given government to rule; the executive and legislative powers of State are at the disposal of a government to make its writ run across the land. The writ of the government must run and be submitted to.
Writ of the State must run
There were extensive periods of time in post-independent Sri Lanka when the State, in the form of the government in power, struggled to ensure its rule ran across the entire land. During the JVP insurrection in 1971, swathes of land came under rebel control to the extent that they occupied police stations, ran cooperatives, petrol sheds and so forth, basically running a de facto government, though short-lived. A quite similar situation arose during the second insurrection in 1988-90 where the JVP, re-running a de facto rule, paralyzed the rule of the elected government. The same inability to run the writ in the North and the East was the norm right throughout the ethnic conflict spanning almost three decades, with the LTTE running a virtual State with their police, Central Bank, legal system, land, naval and air forces.
But now with no such obstruction by opposing military hardware or enforced rebel rule, the writ of the State should run to each and every inch of the landmass within its territory. Yet, there seems to be an anarchy that is almost tangible; one wonders whether the country is under a government at all. On the one hand, the conflict of policy inherent to the two main constituents of the unity government creates confusion as to what the State policy is. The liquor ban issue on women is an ideal example of this dualness of government policy in action.
On the other hand, the inability of the government to ensure submission to its will, its subjects; especially various bodies that represent professionals, businessmen, employees and religious institutions.
A government held hostage
The Buddhist clergy, under self-acclaimed misnomer Maha Sangha, seems to be bullying the government as to how Constitutions are to be drafted; in that sense, they are dictating the government on which nature the future State should be. The medical practitioners through their now infamous GMOA seem to be single-handedly deciding as to how medical education should be shaped, overriding decisions of the government and imposing its will on the policy-making right of a regime that enjoys the legislative mandate of the people. The private bus owners, three wheeler drivers, railway workers, university students organisations and every Tom, Dick and Harry seem to be acting with impunity thereby giving the impression they are mandated to govern.
The notion of democracy does not entail an obligation on the government to give in to the whims and fancies of all sections of the society which it governs. Of course, democratic governance requires the consent of the people when making and implementing policies. In policy-making, the input of all stakeholders is not only a must, but a guarantee that such measures will bear fruit. But once a policy is drafted and legislated, it becomes the decree of the State. To undermine, reverse, belittle or sneer at such directive is denial of the sovereignty of the people who have installed that particular government in the first place through their ballot.
A mockery of governing
Leave alone far-reaching and crucial areas such as Constitutional amendments or devolution of power -- which we all agree needs the consent of the overwhelming majority -- but mundane things such as fixing a bus fare, getting the holidays in the calendar including religious holidays and deciding how school uniforms are to be distributed are matters that should happen smoothly in the ordinary course of business of a government, isnt it How many times did the government have to turn back, sometimes overnight, on its decrees, making a mockery of the powers of governance
According to the theory of social contract, citizens hand over a part of their free will to the State with the undisputed power to rule; to make life safe, enjoyable and fruitful; things that each and every citizen alone is unable to accomplish. Hence, they have willingly imparted part of their freedom and autonomy as citizens, surrendering to the government, so the latter, in turn, with the mandate so granted and sovereign as a result, can rule. The Marxist theory of the State, in a broader sense, is that it is merely an apparatus to protect the interests of the property-owning ruling classes, keeping the toiling masses at bay. Whichever way you look at it, the act of governance involves ruling, using force sometimes and ensuring policies that are implemented for the benefit of the entire society (or at least of those whom it represents).
Time running out
The mandate received on January 8, 2015 was to implement good governance; it was not a mandate for any kind of governance but good governance. Out of that term the good adjective lost a lot of credence very early on. One now wonders, if even the governance part is hollow of substance. Let alone good governance, there does not seem to be any governance at all, going by the farce like scenarios the rulers run into almost every other week.
After the Bolshevik revolution in 1917, the Communist Party had a hard time convincing the Russian peasant population of the benefits of collective farming instead of fragmentised, single-plot farming. The farmers clung on to their small plots of land which have come down from their ancestors. The dictatorship of the proletariat had to use force to get the peasantry into collective farms, giving up their small plots. The result was an agricultural boom that held the communist State in good stead even during World War II. So was it with so many progressive reforms resisted initially by various groups.
Time is running out for the rulingcoalition with less than one and a half years left in office at best. It has an obligation to govern in the first place and govern good. The January 8 mandate does not allow it to govern badly; the social contract it has with its voters does not allow it to abrogate governance in the first place.
Governance sometimes needs resolute and firm steps; and requires political will.

Gotas Viyathmaga and Governments standstill
	
American economist and social theorist Thomas Sowell once said,  The big divide in this country is not between Democrats and Republicans, or men and women, but between talkers and doers  
When a powerful minister of the government gets into a panic and issues a press statement criticizing a speech made by an ordinary citizen at a non political event there is some thing bizarre about it. That was exactly what minister Malik Samarawickrama did a few days ago. When we see his statement challenging the economic views expressed by the Gotabhaya Rajapaksa in his capacity as the chairman of Viyathmaga at the recently concluded Annual Convention 2018, invariably the above quote by Thomas Sowell comes to our mind. Minister Samarawickrama represents a government, which has only been talking for more than 3 years whilst miserably failing in delivery. On the other hand Gotabhaya comes with a proven track record of delivering results whenever he was entrusted with responsibility. So here is a clear divide between a talker and a doer. 
It is no secret that the economy of this country is sliding downhill. During the last three years of the previous government, the average growth rate of the economy was closer to 7%. In 2015 under the new government it dropped to 5%. In 2016 it was down to 4.5%. By 2017 it had further slipped to 3.1%. Though the current government came to power promising 1 million new jobs, the reality is that the 8.4 million jobs that were available in 2014 had come down to 8.2 million by end of 2017. The stock market has lost Rs. 215 billion in market capitalization over the last 3 years. Since January 2015, the rupee has devalued by about 19% and the foreign debts commitments have increased by Rs. 886 billion as result. The unsettled national debt has gone up from Rs. 7,391 billion to 10,400 billion by 2017, a 40% increase in just 3 years. Meanwhile the tax burden had gone up by 60% compared to 2014.
In 2017 the government collected rupees 620 billion more taxes than in 2014. In 2018 government is expected to collect Rs. 1 trillion more taxes than 2014, which will be a 100% increase. Despite these huge tax increases, the benefits to people have not increased. No new roads, no new hospitals, no new schools have come up. Though there was a promise to allocate 6% of GDP for education 3% for health during election times, the real allocations still remains at 1.9% and 1.5% respectively. 
Whilst the economy is struggling, the current government has presented nine different economic policy statements during its first 36 months in office and apparently the tenth is also on the way. Accordingly no one knows which policy document they intend to implement if and when they wake up from the deep slumber they seem to be in currently. 
What Gotabahya had proposed in his speech was that Sri Lanka should look for an economic model on the lines of  social market economy whilst protecting our countrys sovereignty and social values
In a press statement where he has taken great pain to scrutinize the speech delivered by the chairman of Viyathmaga, the minister claims that Gotabhaya had borrowed the idea of a social market economy from the UNPs election manifestos. The minister should consult a doctor as early as possible because he could be suffering from serious hearing problem. On the other hand it could also be his genuine lack of understanding of modern economic theories. Gotabhaya never spoke of a social market economy at the Viyathmaga convention. He was referring to an economic model called  the socialist market economy. This is an economic system and model of economic development employed in China since 1980s. It is a well-established and widely researched economic model that any economist would understand. The term socialist market economy was first used during the 14th national congress of the communist party of China in 1992 to describe the new economic reforms. It is not some thing that economic advisors of UNP have invented.
More significantly, the UNP manifesto of 2015 uses the term social and not socialist. There is a big difference in the meanings of these two words. Currently, China is the second largest economic power in the world, the first exporter and has the highest exchange reserves. For several years, China experienced an average GDP growth of close to 10% per year until 2014, raising per capita GDP almost 49-fold, from 155 current US $ (1978) to 7,590 US $ in 2014, lifting 800 million people out of poverty, an unparalleled achievement. In urban centres in China, poverty has been virtually eliminated. By 2030 China is expected to be the worlds largest economy. There is no harm drawing attention to the proven economic model of China at a forum, which was intended to provoke an intellectual discussion on the need for a clear economic vision and a policy framework for Sri Lanka. Incidentally, the theme of Viyathmaga convention 2018 was An intellectually Inspired Sri Lanka. 
What Gotabahya Rajapaksa had proposed in his speech was that Sri Lanka should look for an economic model on the lines of  social market economy whilst protecting our countrys sovereignty and social values. He proposed that one should look at other successful Asian models also and learn from them. Except those countries that got rich exploiting some other countries during colonial times, all other countries that achieved true development in the past have used their own economic models. Dr. Mahathir Mohammad in Malaysia, Lee Kuan Yew in Singapore, General Park Chung-Hee of Korea and Deng Xiaoping of China found indigenous economic models to bring prosperity to their respective countries. 
There are some commonalities in the approaches adopted by these countries in developing strong economies. For example, strong emphasis on developing exports markets, investment into high quality infrastructure, foreign relations tide to commerce, emphasis on human capital development, skilled and motivated workforce, less red tape, driving innovation and entrepreneurship and heavy investment into technology transfer are some of these. Despite the adoption of open economic policies almost all these countries have a strong state sector involvement in the respective economies. They also provided necessary protections for their local industries while grooming them to be competitive in the global markets.  The economic pundits of the current government may have mentioned some of these concepts in their numerous economic policy write-ups. But none of them is from their original thoughts. The core issue here is the inability of the government to execute any of these plans. Thats why the people are waiting for the first opportunity to see the back of the most incompetent government to rule Sri Lanka since independence. 
As Gotabhaya pointed out in his speech, the objective of Viyathmaga is to mobilize the expertise and knowledge of its members to deliberate, innovate and develop strategies and policies which would influence the top level decision making for the greater good of the society. In that regard our foremost priority at this stage should be the economic development of Sri Lanka and its people. 
We live in a world, which is constantly evolving. Solutions that worked at a particular time may not be that appropriate at a different time. Gotabhayas message in his keynote speech was that we should be flexible in our thinking and develop our own people-centric economic model where the ultimate goal should be the sustained prosperity and the well-being of all people living in the country. 
His concluding remarks given below summarize his thinking on economy. 
The economic growth of a country depends not only on the government policies but also on those who implement those policies. Growth of the economy depends not only on the inflow of capital but also on those who execute and manage those capital investments. An economy does not grow simply based on the theories put forward by economic pundits but is driven by the people who empower it, Finally, if you want to understand the real economy of the country look at the lives of ordinary men and women; the workers who travel daily by bus to work and the farmers who toil in the field 
That is why Viyathmaga is deliberating a people-centric economic model for the country.

Has SL given up its battle against plastic
	
While we Sri Lankans still continue to postpone the date of the plastic ban, the National Geographic magazines June cover continues to inspire millions across the globe to think more seriously of a permanent plastic ban in each and every country. Hailed by environmentalists and the social media, the beautiful cover features a photo-illustration of a plastic bag partly sunken in the ocean, indicating the plastic pollution problem is only the tip of the iceberg. 
Theres enough and more evidence that an average citizen or uninformed politician knows about the plastic pollution is indeed a tip of the iceberg. Theres certainly startling reports coming from scientists at regular intervals as to why governments should make the ban onplastic a priority.
Even before the launch of the Nat Geo cover, scientists have pointed out that a massive dump of plastic waste, bigger than Germany, France and Spain combined, is floating in thePacific Ocean.
While 2017 saw the poverty-stricken Indian capital New Delhi issuing a total ban on single use of plastic and Kenya declaring a four-year jail sentence to anyone producing or selling plastic bags, the Sri Lankan Government backpedalled on the move to ban single use plastics. New Delhi has 20 million people and thats more or less the same population in Sri Lanka. The Sri Lankan Government made the monumental blunder of reneging on its promise of a ban owing to the pressure from plastic producers and retail businessmen. The lesson the government learnt with the collapse of the Meethotamulla garbage dump killing 19 persons was thus soon forgotten.
Lets not forget that its our good neighbour, poverty-stricken Bangladesh, that became the first country to ban plastic bags in 2002, despite strong opposition from traders. Bangladesh made the move on finding that plastic bags choke drainage systems during floods and days after another deluge that played havoc here, Sri Lankans know very well that we too are saddled with the same problem. The only difference in the two countries of course is the variance in the political will.
Researchers have estimated that nearly 15 billion pounds of plastic are added to ocean annually. Worsea plastic bag has been found in the Mariana Trench, oceans deepest point which is nearly 11km from the ocean surface. Ocean plastic are reportedly killing millions of marine animals annually and about 700 marine species including whales are known to have been affected by plastic pollution as the fish and mammals are known to swallow plastic bags and other plastic waste. The National Geographic cover for June comes in the wake of an agreement it inked with the global venture to fight ocean plastics, Sky Ocean Venture, committing USD 10 million to help fight ocean plastic litter.
More and more countries and cities both from the developed and developing world are joining the call for the plastic ban, especially the ones that use plastics, with strong, stringent measures. The Sri Lankan Government should muster courage to go ahead with what it planned last year as the traders and consumers are anyhow likely to adapt themselves to the idea as it happened in other countries in the aftermath of a ban.
Besides, the government should come up immediately with an alternative, especially for plastic bags and lunch sheets, by comparing notes with those with success stories. As for the public using refilling water instead of plastic bottled water and carrying reusable shopping bag are among the easiest things they can do.
The global citizens are already joining hands for the cause. Sri Lanka too is duty-bound to take immediate measures to minimize its contribution to the global catastrophe of plastic pollution.

International community cannot be spectator if Govt. failed: Sampanthan
	
While claiming that the International community could not be a spectator anymore with regard to Sri Lanka, Leader of the Opposition and the Tamil National Alliance R. Sampanthan said today if the Government continued to fail in its commitments, the International Community must clearly state its position on follow up mechanisms to safeguard the victims and ensure non-recurrence of the past.
He told this during a meeting with the visiting United States House of Representatives Armed Services Committee Delegation led by McClellan Thornberry in Colombo today.
Mr Sampanthan urged the delegation that the role of the International Community with regard to Sri Lanka must be defined in relation to the UNHRC recommendations and that the International Community must ensure that the promises and the commitments given by the Sri Lankan Government were adhered to and implemented.
He briefed the delegation on the current political situation in the country and emphasized the importance of both President and Prime Minister working together in order to find solutions to fundamental issues and taking this country forward.
We are unhappy about the way the country is progressing, Mr Sampanthan told the delegation.
Answering a question Sampanthan said, that the majority of the people in this country were willing to address the national issue once and for all.
What is lacking is that the courage from the Sinhala leaders to go out to the people and explicitly tell them on the need for a new Constitution and the benefits of framing a new Constitution, he said.
Some Sinhala political leaders are trying to satisfy the hardliners than being just and equal to all people in this country, they cannot go on this path forever, it will only end up in history being repeated, Sampanthan said.
Especially the President and the Prime Minister must go to the Sinhala people and genuinely explain the need for a new Constitution. Since 1988 every successive Government and President have made several attempts to change the present Constitution, therefore, this should not be a difficult task for the majority of Sinhala people to understand, he added.
He said that they wanted a solution within a United, Undivided and Indivisible Country and added that the power-sharing arrangements should be in accordance with the international covenant on Civil and Political Rights, International Covenant on Economic Social and Cultural Rights and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
Expressing his concerns on the stalled process of drafting a new Constitution Sampanthan said that a new Constitution would pave the way to solve many issues that this country has faced including the heavy debt and economic prosperity, and therefore this effort cannot be abandoned.
He said that the legitimate demands of the Tamil people in finding a lasting solution to the national question could only be addressed through adopting a new Constitution.
Sampanthan highlighted that his party was confident that if the Constitution were passed in Parliament with a two-thirds majority it would be approved by the people at a referendum, which was necessary for a new Constitution.
We may have to rethink and our people will be forced to rethink our position if things do not go well and if things are not achieved within a certain timeframe, he said.
The Government of Sri Lanka has given a Commitment to fully implement the UNHRC resolution adopted in 2015 before March 2019. It must fast-track the process to achieve those commitments, he told the delegation.

Internecine battles precede the major battle
	

Despite the PC polls being months away, the battles for chief purohita posts have already begun in earnest,they say.

Of all battles, the keenest is expected to be the one for Sabaragamuwa according to present indications.
The first to have raised the battle cry is the gem-city faction of the Pohottuwa group in Sabaragamuwa which has made representations to the former strongman that a party candidate from the gem-rich district be nominated to vie for the Sabaragamuwa this time round.
If the Pohottuwa nominee is to be from the gem-rich district, who should be that nominee is the question that has again led to a battle within the Pohottuwa camp itself.
It is no secret that Madam Clean had been eyeing the Sabaragamuwa chief purohita post
for donkeys years. However, she fell foul of the Pohottuwa stalwarts of the district when she went into a deal with the Greens at the recent election of a chair for the gem-city council. Pohottuwa heavyweights who have now ruled out Madam Clean are said to be planning to put forward John the Silent who has now joined the opposition, as their Chief Purohita candidate.
Meanwhile, the chief one Mahi from Kegalle set for yet another term in the coveted post, has already appealed to the former strongman not to ignore his claim to be the Pohottuwa nominee.
Given this situation, Pohottuwa chief, the former strongman is faced with the grim prospect of bringing about a ceasefire within his own camp in the gem-rich district before entering the real battle ahead, they say.

Karunarathna Maha Vidyalaya students assemble and fly tiny aircraft
	
It is a matter for pleasure that Karunarathna Maha Vidyalaya in Mattumagala is ready to produce a set of talented and innovative children whose service would be beneficial to the the country in the near future. The best example set by this school is that two of its children have assembled a tiny aircraft which can fly over 6000 feet from the ground level. 
It is the principal of this school, K.A. Nijamalee Palika who had paved the way to achieve this success with her guidance and advice. Dhananja Waidyasekera, the teacher-in-charge of the technology subject had given every support to these two children to keep pace with the scientific and technological aspects of the world. In addition, they have been encouraged by the class teacher Aruna Warnakumara. 
The credit should go to the two children: Vimukthi Lakshan and Sadev Mihisara who have invented it while studying in grades 13 and 11 respectively. This is how Vimukthi expressed his views about their new invention: 
I began to look for the parts and accessories to assemble a toy aircraft. I got them down through using on-line facilities and assembled an aircraft with the help of my fellow schoolmate Sadev Mihisara. It was amidst the applause by our school children, we flew the aircraft in the air. Then, our joys knew no bounds
After finishing my O/Level examination, I was watching the taking off of aircraft and the methodology of assembling them in the internet while I was at home. Then, I was toying with the idea of assembling aircraft and flying them. My father is a driver. He did not have any knowledge about technology but kept encouraging me. Further, I began to look for the parts and accessories which were required for assembling a toy aircraft. I got them down through using on-line facilities and assembled an aircraft with the help of my fellow schoolmate Sadev Mihisara. It was amidst the applause by our school children, we flew the aircraft in the air. Then, our joys knew no bounds. 
He added that their parents as well as others have helped them to their maximum extent and to the best of their abilities. According to him, it was their dream to become engineers in the field of aviation technology. 
Vimukthi Lakshan and Sadev Mihisara thanked their teachers whole-heatedly for having helped them in numerous ways. In the meantime, he is happy to share the knowledge which he had gained with his fellow schoolmates with a view to producing intelligent citizens.

Kudu Anjus birthday gift took Dhananjayas beloved father 
	

Gang related killings are nothing new in Sri Lanka. Slaying individuals like dogs in broad daylight owing to unsettled narcotic disputes and politically motivated murders by organised armed gangs were widely reported in the last three decades. However, with or without correct punitive measures these organised activities seemed to have subdued somewhat but that was short-lived. The recent murder of Dehiwala-Mt. Lavinia Municipal Councillor Ranjan de Silva in cold blood raises a question, whether drug related, politically motivated murders are emerging once again. Or is the underworld raising its ugly head again
Former DMMC Councillor, for being the beloved father of the Sri Lanka top order promising cricketer Dhananjaya de Silva, had managed to gain much attention on this murder case by the probing bodies compared to many other isolated and gang related killings reported throughout the recent past. 
Also the fact being that this was the first killing reported of an elected candidate to a local government body from the recently concluded elections, the authorities are working hard to make a breakthrough as to what led to his murder.

It was just another usual evening to Ranjan de Silva, whose house situated on the beach-side amidst a line of houses parallel to the southern railway track and along Sri Gnanendra Road (formerly Sea Beach Road) that connects between the Ratmalana and Angulana Railway Stations. 

Her shock turns into horror when she happens to see two individuals walking away from the crime scene carrying a weapon hangingfrom shoulder 

He comes out of the house around 7.00pm on Thursday May 24th and walks along the boundary of his parapet wall towards the next adjoining house, in between where a concrete slab is placed on the ground to casually sit facing the double railway track. 
This is Ranjans favourite spot where he spends every evening chatting with neighbours and those who pass by as well as those who come to buy grocery goods from the small boutique run by the neighbouring house, until television news starts at 8.30pm, which he
never missed. 
As usual Ranjan is having a casual chat with a fisherman in the area named Pankiriarachchige Sarath Jayakody (45) and a DMMC labourer Menituge Upali Silva (58) who lit a cigarette he just bought from the adjoining boutique. 
It would have been close to 8.15pm when the trio who were engaged in conversation hardly noticed three other strangers approach them in a very casual manner from the other side of the railway tracks through the poorlylit atmosphere. 
The next split second, a shower of gunfire sprayed upon Ranjan and his friends for another good few seconds before the assailants quietly retreat to the direction they came from and to disappear through a narrow ally covered with trees leading to the Sri Gnanendra Road. 
The household woman Lalani Priyanga who is running the small grocery next to Ranjans house and who is also distantly related to him was surprised by the string of fire crackers that suddenly went off just outside her boutique and the screams of pain.

Her surprises soon turns into a shock when she rushes outside to find Mahatun Mama (Ranjans household name) lying in a pool of blood whilst his two associates running for their lives in a wobbly manner. 
Her shock turns into horror when she happens to see two other individuals (fairly built) clad in dark clothing unsuspectingly walking away from the crime scene crossing the railway tracks, one carrying a long gun like weapon hanging fromhis shoulder. 

Youngest son Janangas wish was to dress his father with his tailor made elegant groom kit meant for his wedding next week 


Lalani who lifted Ranjan from behind and embraced him in utmost shock could notice Mahatun Mama gazing at her in deep pain and trying to say something but his lips not moving. With blood gushing out of her uncles bullet riddled body Lalani started crying for help. 
With the aid of Ranjans younger sister Sarojini de Silva, who rushed out of the house hearing the commotion and with another boy in the area, the critically wounded man was being rushed to the Colombo South Teaching Hospital in Kalubowila in a passing-by trishaw. 
In the meantime, Ranjans youngest son and Dhananjayas twin brother Jananga de Silva, who had gone to Dehiwala with his mother to deliver invitation cards to his pre-planned wedding on June 08, receives a distressing phone call from a relative that his father had been shot by an unknown gunman and is being transported to the Kalubowila Hospital. 
Jananga rushes to the hospital first with his mother to receive the most unexpected scene of his life, the lifeless body of his father soaked in blood being brought in by his wailing aunts. Ranjan was admitted straight into the Emergency Treatment Unit and within moments Jananga learns that his father is no more.  He was soon joined by his twin brother Dhananjaya, who had rushed from Colombo with several of his team mates that were almost preparing to board a flight bound for West Indies on the following morning to take part in the next Sri Lanka test series. 
Survived by the loving wife H.E. Sriyalatha sitting next to her partners coffin said her youngest son Janangas (26) wish was to dress his father with his tailor made elegant groom kit meant for his wedding next week. 
She recalled how Ranjan (born in April 26, 1956) from Aluthgama and married her in 1983 before moved into live in Ratmalana. Being a committed employee at the Dehiwala  Mt. Lavinia Municipal Council for over 30 years, Ranjan retired from the government service few years back to spend life at leisure. 
Although his first attempt to enter into active politics in 1991 through the Democratic United National Front (DUNF) led by Lalith Athulathmudali failed, his second chance became fruitful, having accepted his eldest sons ticket to contest for the DMMC in Februarys local government elections. 
Savithra de Silva, an active youth in his late twenties having completed four-year tenure as a DMMC Councillor since 2014, decides to transfer his contesting ticket to his father with the blessing and guidance of then President and incumbent Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) Leader Mahinda Rajapaksa and his brother Gotabaya Rajapaksa.
Ranjan known as a mild mannered kind hearted character in the Sea Beach Road area for helping the needy and also raising a voice against the prevailing narcotic menace became more popular than his son Savithra, took his decision to contest for the DMMCin February. 
At the same pace Ranjan was becoming popular in the area for his dedicated social work, his attempts to voice against the flourishing heroin trade in the neighbourhood too attracted an untoward danger to his life and the family. 
Not only the findings of the investigations of the homicide that surfaced the ugly reality of this drug menace but it was a popular secret in the area that Ranjans family was too caught up in a long standing lethal feud between two prominent gangs that deal heroin in Ratmalana and its suburbs like Wedikanda, Angulana and Gonakovila. 
Senior police detectives of Mt. Lavinia division who are in charge of the probe have unearthed that a long held dispute between two underworld gangs engaged in drug trafficking had led to many tit-for-tat killings throughout the recent past. 

The two underworld gangs engaged in drug trafficking had led to many tit-for-tat killings throughout the recent past


Several prominent names that revolves in the Ratmalana drug mafia are Sinhara Asanka Silva alias Lansiya (late) his younger brother Sinhara Amal Silva alias Kudu Anju (who is overseas evading arrest) and their associate Don Salu Shalu Roshan Indika de Silva alias Rosa (who contested DMMC in February from United National Party and lost) whilst their arch rivals Demuni Herald Rohana de Silva alias Gonakovila Roha (who currently serving a term for killing a police officer) and Western Provincial Councillor Amal Silva (who had a narrow shave in a recent shooting).
The recent dispute had started when Sinhara Asanka Silva alias Lansiya who ran the heroin business in Ratmalana was gunned down by his rival Gonakovila Roha in front of Mahara Magistrate Court in 2016.
After the killing of Lansiya his younger brother Sinhara Amala Silva alias Kudu Anju took his brothers heroin business into his hands and entered the active underworld. Anju had supported Don Salu Shalu Roshan Indika de Silva alias Rosa to contest the Municipal Council to strengthen his political power. It was Rosa who tried to kill Gonakovila Roha with two pistols smuggled into Mt. Lavinia Magistrates Courts last year when the latter was brought for production over killing a police officer in Kurunegala.  However, Anju who had constant threats from Rohas associates had escaped to Singapore and then to Dubai sometime back. 
In the most recent event, the STF raided drug den in Ratmalana on May 17 and arrested seven supporters of Anju with 27 grams of heroin. According to residents, Anju had been misled that his drug den was tipped off by Savithra de Silva alias Sangu, the elder son of assassinated councillor. On Vesak Poya Day (April 29) Savithra had beaten three of Anjus close associates at a Dansela in Sea Beach Road over a heated argument. Savithra was the first to lodge a complaint with Mt. Lavinia Police regarding this and the both parties that were summoned to an inquiry later came into a settlement. 
But in Savithras mind it echoes that perhaps it was him the gunmen were targeting rather than his father. What bewilders most is a status post said to have been made by Anju via his Facebook account on the day of the councillors killing that it was a great relief that he felt after a long time. The post was soon taken down and the account was deactivated. 
But something very few knew and was spoken of was that it was Anjus birthday that fell on May 24th and allegedly it was his supporters that gunned down Ranjan de Silva as a birthday gift to him.  

Multiple weapons used for the killing
Police probes so far into the gruesome murder had revealed that three men had come for the killing bearing a T-56 assault rifle, a 9mm revolver and a long knife. The assailants who had sprayed bullets targeting Ranjan and his associates had slashed him several times before fleeing the scene and making sure that the targeted victim sustained fatal wounds. 
The post mortem at the Kalubowila Hospital revealed Ranjan having received four gunshot wounds except for a slash on the arm below the left elbow and two stab injuries on the right side of the chest.
Statements have been recorded from over 20 individuals including several that suspected to be of supporters of Kudu Anju.
Mt. Lavinia Police led by its HQI CI Rohan Pushpakumara and OIC Crimes Branch CI Udaya Kumara and Mt. Lavinia Divisional Crime Detective Bureau officials are conducting investigations on the instructions of acting SSP Mt. Lavinia Division Rohan Fernando and ASP Saman Jayasekara under the supervision of DIG Western Province South Wasantha Wickramasinghe whilst a separate probe is underway by Police Special Task Force Crimes, Organised Crimes and Narcotic Detection Unit.

Lankan currency notes traced back to a Lankan
	

The recent news story that a huge amount of money in our countrys currency was among the valuables found in the treasure trove unearthed from a private residence of the ousted Malay high political authority raised many eyebrows in our country.

The authorities in that country and those in ours who made investigations as to how the ousted high political authority had come to have a large bundle of our countrys currency notes in his possession, have traced the origin of the money to a Lankan worthy operating a mobile phone company in the West.
It has come to light that this Lankan worthy has made several investments in that country and he is believed to have offered santhosham to several local authorities there to cut corners and the former Malay political bigwig had been among the recipients of such a santhosham.

The white-collar ones handling immigration and emigration launched a work-to-rule recently.

When there were daily reports that the foreign tourists, both departures and arrivals, were being subjected to long delays at our main airport, the authorities realized the gravity of the situation. However, they did not want to give in easily and instructed the purohita in charge of the subject to play tough for a while before giving in. Accordingly, the purohita told the striking ones that he was planning to deploy air force personnel at the immigration/ emigration checkpoints to smoothen the departure and arrival flows if the work-to-rule was dragged on.
Number One in yahapalanaya went livid when he heard that a move was afoot to deploy air force personnel at the immigration/emigration checkpoints at the main airport and had immediately rung up the purohita concerned and told him to start negotiations without resorting to stupid things. And the purohita lost no time in carrying out the order coming from the top,they say.

Popular games main chair up for grabs
	

The election of new office-bearers for the body controlling the countrys popular game is due on May 31 and several big names in the game have entered the fray for the main chair, they say.

Several former chairs and the incumbent chair are among those in the forefront of the battle for the main chair. Objections to nominations for the posts had to be made last Tuesday. The highlight of the day was an unexpected upsurge of objections to the nomination of one big name and the objection-making documents had run into over 1500 pages, they say.
The ruling on these objections is to be delivered on May 29.
Meanwhile, the runner whose nomination drew an unprecedented number of objections had obtained the official nod to file his answer as a confidential document and this, the other runners have complained, would place the aspirant at an undue advantage over his rivals.
Therefore, indications are that the battle for the main chair of the popular game will finally end up in courts.

Professor Sarath Wijesuriya says GMOA doesnt have the backbone to question Gotabaya
	
Prof. Sarath Wijesuriya of the National Movement for Social Justice spoke about the questionable activities of the GMOA as a trade union, President Maithripala Sirisena not honouring his promise to abolish the Executive Presidency and his movements intention not to support a common candidate at a future election in an interview with the Daily Mirror.
Wijesuriya believes that whoever who advised President Sirisena has changed the latters focus
	The professor sees that the common candidate they appointed has forgotten to deliver on his promises
	The GMOA has lost its independence as an independent trade union
	Both Purawesi Balaya and NMSJ do not receive foreign aid
	Under any circumstance I do not support SAITM, but I stand for private education
	During the Rajapaksa regime there was no one to challenge them (GMOA)
	The GMOA officers started making all the allegations only after we filed a case against its President
Excerpts:
Q GMOA has leveled a strong criticism against Purawesi Balaya. They say that groups like Purawesi Balaya interferein legitimate trade unions suchas GMOA. What can you sayabout this
The National Movement for Social Justice, founded by late Ven. Maduluwawe Sobitha Thera, named a common candidate to contest the presidency at the last Presidential Elections. In any of the instances groups like Purawesi Balaya nor National Movement for Social Justice (NMSJ) never posed problems to trade unions like Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA).
They all started questioning us after Gamini Viyangoda and I filed a case against the GMOA President for contempt of court. The statement GMOA made has no base and is purely a statement made through personal vengeance.
NMSJ is registered and has its own constitution. I must emphasize that the case filed against the GMOA President wasnt filed by either Purawesi Balaya or NMSJ. It was solely filed by Gamini Viyangoda and I as concerned citizens. Also both Purawesi Balaya and NMSJ arent trade unions. They consist of people who are interested in social, cultural and political activities in the country.
Although the GMOA claims that both these organizations are Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) it isnt true. We know that NGOs are organizations ,which receive funds from foreign countries, and engage in social and political activities. But both Purawesi Balaya and NMSJ do not receive foreign aid and we too havent. The expenses of our activities are borne by the members, based on the donations given by our friends. We do have a bank account, but we do not have a massive deposit. This is because we collect money on need basis to complete each task during a particular time.
The GMOA is unable to entertain opposite views. This was supported by the Rajapaksa regime. During that time some people lost their lives as a result of expressing opposite views. This is against democracy
Since the gentlemen from GMOA have declared that they are going to expose the foreign aid we have received, as they claim, I want to challenge them. If they prove that we have received any foreign aid we will remove the case filed in courts within 24 hours. I know they cannot prove anything as all their allegations are false.
The GMOA has lost its independence as an independent trade union. They engage in political activities. It has become a society which works in support of Mahinda Rajapaksa and Gotabaya Rajapaksa. The office bearers of the GMOA misuse the organization. They dont speak about their professional rights and instead speak about policies.
The GMOA officers started making all the allegations only after we filed a case against its President. Also there were conflicts with regard to the SAITM issue. Some of the members of Purawesi Balaya were present in some of the meetings which supported SAITM. I never expressed that the conduct of SAITM is correct. But when expressing my views I have stated that we need to establish private education in the country. There should be an opportunity to receive a standard education in medicine for capable and talented students paying a fee. We are against the monopoly of Doctors. Under any circumstance I do not support SAITM, but I stand for private education.
If the GMOA maintains that only those who qualify should be allowed to enter medical college it is a dream that cant be realised.
For a long time many civil societies surfaced in the country to cater to certain needs. They exist for some time and due to many reasons cease to exist. In a democratic country it is a right of the people to get together and work for a singular cause they believe in. Its ironical that the GMOA questioned the Labour Commissioner whether organizations like Purawesi Balaya are registered. It is my opinion that only trade unions have to register under the Labor Commissioner.
As a collective, which came together to bring the common candidate to power, one complain levelled against us is that we are supported by NGOs and we dance according to the tune of the countries which back us. My point is why dont the parties which make allegations against us take any legal action and prove their accusations. Following their actions what I understand is that the GMOA is under pressure. During the Rajapaksa regime there was no one to challenge them (GMOA). They used poor patients as a shield in order to win their rights. We know that many who visit Government hospitals arent the rich, but the down trodden masses. This is evident from the voice cuts given to the electronic media (television).
The GMOA takes revenge from such people. But the same doctors engage in private practice. There were instances when some top GMOA officials engaged in private practice in a private hospital.
There is another point I observe. The GMOA is unable to entertain opposite views. This was supported by the Rajapaksa regime. During that time some people lost their lives as a result of expressing opposite views. This is against democracy.
Its hilarious that the GMOA questions how organizations like Purawesi Balaya receive funds. But the same organization does not have the backbone to question former Defense Secretary Gotabya Rajapaksa, a former Government officer, who is conducting Viyath Maga by spending enormous amounts of money at Shangrila Hotel. GMOA hasnt questioned how he (Gotabaya) received money to conduct that programme. This is because they are members of the same group.
Q The GMOA wanted Purawesi Balaya to declare its assets. Are you going to do that
I give leadership to NMSJ and not to Purawesi Balaya. But I do engage in various activities of Purawesi Balaya. We do not have members in that front. Its only a movement which obtains the services of people from the civil society who love to work using their principles. There are no presidents on treasurers in this movement.
There is only a convener to coordinate activities. I am aware that Purawesi Balaya doesnt have much assets. We dont have an office, vehicle nor a computer. We do have a bank account, but we do not have a considerable deposit, a fact which I know very well.
GMOA does not have the backbone to question former Defense Secretary Gotabya Rajapaksa, a former Government officer, who is conducting Viyath Maga by spending enormous amounts of money at Shangrila Hotel
Q There is an allegation that groups like Purawesi Balaya receive funds from foreigncountries and cater to theirwishes. Is this true
There should be a base for all these allegations. All these allegations are false. I would like to challenge them and prove my point.
Q Is Purawesi Balaya willing to declare its assets
We would like them to disclose what they claim as alleged assets in our possession. We clearly know that they cannot prove anything. We have nothing to hide. I challenge them to prove their allegations. If they do we will withdraw the case filed against the GMOA President within 24 hours.
Q Going future on this subject would you consider registering Purawesi Balaya as an organisation
We are a collective of people who gathered with common interests on social, cultural and political issues. We dont want to make this a trade union or any other Organization. We have no intention of collecting money for this organization. None of the individuals who give leadership to our groups have the intention of entering active politics. We only want to see a just societyand challenge manipulation ofgovernment assets.
It has become a society which works in support of Mahinda Rajapaksa and Gotabaya Rajapaksa. The office bearers of the GMOA misuse the organization. They dont speakabout their professional rights and instead speak about policies
Q Purawesi Balaya entered the political scene with the intention of abolishing the Executive Presidency. Three years have passed since and the executive Presidency still continues. We cannot see that you are applying sufficient pressure on the Government to abolish it. What can you say about this
During the past few months we conducted many seminars around the country. The reason behind this is to force the Government to keep the promises made on January 8th. We conducted these seminars continuously but had to halt them due to provincial councils elections.
However we can see that the common candidate we appointed has forgotten to deliver on his promises. Instead he has sought advise from the Supreme Court on whether he could remain in power for six years.
He has openly stated that he wishes to contest in 2020. On the day of the funeral of the late Ven. Sobitha Thera he vouched that the executive presidency would be abolished. I believe that whoever who advised the President has changed his focus and has been successful in keeping him away from achieving the goals he is supposed to achieve.
Undoubtedly we are aware that the President would not keep his promise made on January 8th. Therefore we are preparing ourselves as civil societies to take action. However this does not mean we would support another common candidate.
If they prove that we have received any foreign aid we will remove the case filed in courts within 24 hours. I know they cannot prove anything as all their allegations are false
Q When the first cabinet reshuffle took place under the Good Governance Government you stated that this was done in order to appease some members of the SLFP and the UNP. What do you have to say about the recent Government reshuffle
Instead of keeping up with the promises made by President Sirisena the cabinet was reshuffled a couple of times to retain his power in the SLFP. We cant assume that all these changes were made for the betterment of the society. When a leader keeps changing the Governments position it show that he is unsuccessful. He has betrayed the people of this country by doing so.
Q What is your next step
I cant make a direct statement with regard to Purawesi Balaya. But I can say that we have acquired a new face and getting ready.

## Title: SL Human Rights Commissions status upgraded to A

SL Human Rights Commissions status upgraded to A
	
The status of the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lankas (HRCSL) had been upgraded to A from the previous B by the National Human Rights Institutions (NHRIs), the international accreditation agency for national human rights institutions.
Dr. N. Deepika Udagama, the Chairperson of the HRCSL said they received an official notification from the NHRIs about the upgrade yesterday.
Speaking to Daily Mirror, Dr. Udagama said it is difficult to get an A status because the NHRIs is very particular about the principles and independence of a countrys Human Rights Commission.
The Commissions independence both structurally and in practice and effectiveness of the Commission in terms of looking at various human rights issues in the country are looked at by the NHRIs. If a Commission does not work on difficult issues like torture or discrimination, it wont receive the A grade. The NHRIs look at many issues, mainly dealing with its independence at tackling human rights issues without fear or favour, she said.
She said the latest accreditation is a great victory for Sri Lanka and that it was a result of a collective effort of all the commissioners and everyone at the commission.
This is also a victory for the 19th Amendment because its the Constitutional Council which nominates members to the Commission. The Chairperson is appointed by the President from among the nominations made by the Constitutional Council. I think that has gone a long way and as Chair I have to say in all honesty that I'm very lucky because I have got a very strong commission.
The commissioners bring in a lot of talent and they are fiercely independent. Otherwise, it would have been very difficult because there was an issue of credibility of the commission. Thats the challenge we had when we took over. There was the sense that the Commission did not want to take up certain issues which are considered to be politically sensitive. For us, the biggest challenge was to win the confidence of the public, Dr. Udagama said.(Lahiru Pothmulla)

Sobitha Thera didnt ask common candidate to break banks
	
President Maithripala Sirisena said today the late Ven. Maduluwawe Sobitha Thera, who came forward to set up a Government through a common candidate, never asked a common candidate to loot the Central Bank.
The President expressed these views at the 76th commemoration of the late Ven. Sobitha Thera held at Foundation Institute in Colombo.
President Sirisena, who paid a surprise visit to the event, said he had not received an official invitation to attend the event. The President had this to say-:
I had not received an official invitation to attend the event. I came to know about it through a third party. My media director said the event was organized by Ravi Jayawardene. I contacted him and asked about my omission. He said there had been a mistake. Everyone had hoped I would be invited but no one took the initiative to do so.
Some say the government went wrong after I took up the chairmanship of the SLFP. I can explain to you what actually happened and who ruined the vision of the Ven. Sobitha Thera.
I brought todays Daily Mirror newspaper along with me. It has posted a photo of me and Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad saying that I have not done what he has done in five days. It says Malaysian Prime Minister has arrested nine ministers, 144 businessmen and 50 judges accused of corruption. I phoned Malaysia and our High Commissioner in Malaysia and they said these claims are all false. Social media also critisised me me in the last few days saying I have not done what Mahathir took five days to accomplish.
I am a person who came forward to make this country better and carry out the principles of good governance in its true sense. I could have earned huge sums of money when I was the Health Minister if I wanted to. I am truly hurt by the wrong interpretations that has been formed in the minds of the public about me. I am taken aback when I hear things such as the fact that cases against wrongdoers are not being taken up because of me. People never expected an investigation to be launched into allegations that former Minister T.B. Ekanayake gave a vehicle to someone, former Deputy Minister Priyankara Jayaratne giving a job to his daughter and former Minister A.H.M. Fowzie misusing a vehicle belonging to another ministry.
People in this country did not expect such behaviour from their public representatives. If family members of murdered rugby player Wasim Thajudeen and lawyers appeared in his case were taken to one place and asked, they would reveal what had happened.
We must see why I could not carry out most of what people expected me to do after electing me the President. I had not experienced insults, character assassination and disgrace in my 47-year-old political career than I experienced as the President. As former President Ranasinghe Premadasa had said, I am someone who is well-tempered with politics.
Some people say if anyone contested the Presidential Election as the common candidate could have won. If so they could have done so. I was used as the common candidate as I was a clean politician and came forward as a lion despite life threats.
After I was sworn in as the President on January 9, Mr Ranil Wickremesinghe was sworn in as the Prime Minister. However, the UNP had only 47 seats in Parliament then. How can a Government be formed with only 47 seats
These people came up with a One-hundred-day Programme, which didnt include a dissolving of Government. If that programme was not in place, the main task available was to dissolve Parliament. The one-hundred-day programme was one of the silliest things ever undertaken by this government.
Had I not accepted the chairmanship of the SLFP, Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake of the group of 47 MPs would have failed to pass the budget in Parliament.

Who provided helicopters to former President Mahinda Rajapaksa to go to Tangalle unharmed after the Presidential election results were announced Was it me No! It was so and so. (Ariyaratna Ranabahu)

Some Greens had gone yellow
	

The Green backbenchers had, the other day, rendezvoused to take a vital decision.

Of over 20 invitees, only eight members had turned up at the tryst. And each of them had made the full use of this forum to give vent to their woes resulting from the step motherly treatment meted out to them by the party leadership.
Finally, all eight members had reached a consensus to function as an independent group in the council.
Then a member hailing from the Badulla district had said: Well, thats a good idea. Let us hand over a letter to the leadership stating our decision and the reasons that led us to reach this decision.
So, one of them had drafted a letter on the lines all agreed to and had sent it round for their signatures.
When this letter returned after going a full round, the sender had found that it carried only two signatures. One signatory was the Badulla district member who initiated the move and the other was a young member from the gem-rich district.
Livid about the shameless let-down by his colleagues, the Badulla member had torn up the letter into several pieces and vowed not to have anything with the spineless creatures in future!
