Confused Sirisena yielding ground to resurgent MR-Indian media
	
		 		 
		 
			
The fledgling Maithripala Sirisena-Ranil Wickremesinghe government appears to be yielding ground to a resurgent former President Mahinda Rajapaksa because of internal disunity, contradictory policies and indecisive political leadership, The New Indian Express reported.
The first concrete sign of deep trouble appeared on Tuesday when the governments bid to get parliaments nod for raising the threshold of Treasury Bills by LKR 400 billion to meet vital government expenditure was defeated by 21 votes.
The defeat clearly indicated that the government cannot take for granted the support of the opposition Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) for the 19 th. Constitutional Amendment. This amendment is meant to dilute the powers of the President and increase the powers of the Prime Minister and parliament. It was a major plank of Sirisenas Presidential election campaign and is the brainchild of the United National Party (UNP) his electoral ally.
The SLFPs position is anomalous. It is with the government to the extent that its chairman, Sirisena, is the President of Sri Lanka and 29 of its MPs are ministers. But it is in the Opposition because the UNP is its traditional political rival. The SLFP wants Sirisena to ditch the UNP form an SLFP-led government as the SLFP is the single largest party in parliament.
But Sirisena is dithering, torn between his electoral ally UNP and his own party, the SLFP.
Frustrated, many SLFP MPs and supporters are now flocking to public meetings organized by Rajapaksas acolytes, and demanding that he lead the party.
The SLFP has made it clear that it will not vote for the 19 th Amendment if the directly elected President is not recognized as the Head of the Government and if electoral reforms are not introduced simultaneously. It has asked Sirisena not to yield to the UNPs demand for a mid-term poll in June.
Meanwhile, many multi-million dollar development projects initiated by Rajapaksa have ground to a halt, partly due to a policy paralysis and partly due to investigations into corrupt deals. Ministers constantly contradict each other. Hopes of employment generation have dimmed. The promised lowering of prices has not happened. And Rajapaksa shines in contrast as a decisive leader, whose regime, though corrupt, delivered. (P.K.Balachandran- The New Indian Express)

TN Fishermen protest continuing arrests by Lankan Navy
	
The fishermen of Rameswaram, in Tamil Nadu staged a demonstration on Friday, protesting against the arrest of fishermen and confiscation of their boats by Sri Lankan navy and urging the authorities to secure their traditional fishing rights in the Palk Bay.
Led by fishermen leader P. Sesu Raja, members of all mechanised boats fishermen associations, raised slogans against the Lankan navy. Mr. Raja urged the Centre to prevail upon the Lankan government to secure the release of boats and fishermen arrested after the third round of talks in Chennai on March 24.
He said when the Indian fishermen were expecting a favourable response from Lankan Tamil fishermen for reaching an agreement for peaceful fishing, there were disturbing reports of Lankan President Maithripala Sirisena ordering the arrest of Indian fishermen who crossed the International Maritime Boundary Line (IMBL).
Lankan navy again started intimidating the Indian fishermen, who ventured into the Palk Bay for fishing, he said, and urged the Centre to protect their livelihood by securing their traditional right to fish in the Palk Bay.
Fearing the Lankan navy, most fishermen from Rameswaram refrained from venturing into the sea for fishing, he said.
They were left with just three more fishing days before the 45-day ban on fishing started on April 14 but the fishermen were not willing to take the risk, he said.
Fishermen leaders who took part in the agitation wanted the State and Central governments to help the fishermen of the two countries to reach an agreement for peaceful fishing in the Palk Bay, in the new season starting in June.
Mr. Sesu Raja, who led the team which brought back 33 of the 86 boats detained in Sri Lanka and ordered to be released by Mr. Sirisena, said 28 more boats would be brought back in the second salvage operation to commence next week.
The remaining boats either drowned or suffered extensive damage, he said, and urged the governments to pay compensation to the owners. (THE HINDU)

	Former Ministers SM Chandrasena (Anuradhapura district MP) and Salinda Dissanayake (Kurunegala district MP) have been removed from the SLFP Central Committee
MP Dissanayake speaking to Daily Mirror Online a short while ago said no explanation has been done as to why he was removed from the Central Committee and added that he is shocked at the decision as he was engaged in politics representing the SLFP for over 40 years. He is among the SLFP MPs who are backing the call for former President Rajapaksa to be made the PM candidate of the UPFA.
I was imprisoned three times; my parents homes were set on fire as a result of my affiliation with the SLFP. But after new President Maithripala appointed a new group of officials in the party, those with a lower seniority level were given higher positions in the party simply owing to the fact that they pledged support to him, he said.
He went on to state that President Sirisena has no right to remain as the SLFP Chairman after contesting at the election from the swan symbol.
He is trying to break the backbone of the SLFP and make it servile to the UNP. We will not be discouraged by these harassments  in fact we will continue our struggle to make former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, the Prime Minister of Sri Lanka, he said. (Lakna Paranamanna)
