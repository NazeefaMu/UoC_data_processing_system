Colombo Additional Magistrate Nishantha Peiris today issued arrest warrants on Indika Karunajeewa and Iresha Silva again over the two cases conducted under money laundering Charges against Namal Rajapaksa and five others over alleged purchasing of Hello Corp shares.
The FCID told court today that the statements recorded from the suspects and other extracts pertaining to the two cases were sent to the Attorney General for his opinion.
Namal Rajapaksa and five others, Sudarshana Bandara, Nithya Senani, Sujani Bogollagama, were accused over alleged two transactions worth Rs. 45 million, which were discovered during the main inquiry conducted against them into the alleged purchasing Rs. 100million worth shares of a company called Hello Corp.
The two transactions were found by the prosecution as offences that fell under the Money Laundering Act.
Earlier, the prosecution had filed two separate cases against the suspects over the two suspicious Rs. 15 million and Rs. 30 million transactions.
According to the FCID, the suspect Namal Rajapaksa had dealt with a company called 'Boston Capital' and given Rs. 15 million by himself and another Rs. 30 million through one Indika Karunajeewa to the chairman of that company, Mr. Rohan Abey Iriyagolla, in order to conceal the origin of the alleged ill gotten funds.
The prosecution alleged that according to the statements from the chairman of the Boston Company, the given money was paid to Gowers Corporation and NR Consultancy Companies again, which are headed by Namal Rajapaksa, under the disguise of payments for the services obtained by the Boston Company.

By Zahara Zuhair
The 37th National Conference, organized by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka (CA Sri Lanka) themed Unleashed Thinking is scheduled for October.
CA Sri Lanka President Lasantha Wickremasinghe said that he believes the country can boost its standing as a global player, by encouraging and promoting entrepreneurship and intrapreneurship, which will help take Sri Lanka to the next level.
He said that the conference goes beyond conventional norms and provokes thoughts and spurs insights into broad issues, apart from the core emphasis on finance related topics.
As a country, he said that there is a great potential to be a global player, but reaching the true potential takes a lot of hard work and innovation which has to be spearheaded by the business leaders and corporates.
Although a relatively new concept, an intrapreneur is known as someone who serves as an employee of a company and has the ability to spearhead reinventing themselves and take advantage of new opportunities, he explained.
We like to promote entrepreneurship among our members, we believe our country is in need of entrepreneurs, National Conference Committee Chairman Tishan Subasinghe said.
He said around 1,500 leading businesses would participate in the conference, noting that this will be an inspiration for young members who want to be an entrepreneur.
National Conference Technical Committee 2016 Chairman Anoji De Silva said that as Sri Lanka is ranked as an Efficiency- driven economy in the World Economic Forum, The Global Competitiveness Report 2015-2016, along with other Asian countries such as Malaysia, Thailand, China, now its aim should be to transit to an Innovation-driven economy like USA and Singapore to be a true global player.
In that context, we came up with the theme. We believe we have to think big and different. As a nation, we have to draw a development plan that is unique to us, that will also preserve our culture and environment, she said.
She said that the technical sessions will focus on seven areas covering, extreme entrepreneur, breaking stereotypes - age is just a number, unleashing corporate entrepreneurship, harnessing power of millennials, digitisation - your next competitive play, no dream is too big and funding entrepreneurship.
CA Sri Lanka Vice President Jagath Perera stressed that all the citizens in the country should think big and move forward, as the country needs to catch up what it has lost for several years.
He also said that the conference will be an effective and creative for everyone.
Responding to a question with regard to shifting entrepreneurial focus to the agriculture sector, it was noted that it is a subject which should be deliberated extensively to come up with a mechanism and module, as there are many red tapes prevailing in the industry at present.

China ready to pump in over US $ 5bn in FDIs: envoy
	
Chinas top diplomat in the country yesterday said that the worlds second largest economy is prepared to commit over US $ 5 billion in foreign direct investments (FDIs) over the medium to long term for special economic zones, if the Sri Lankan government is prepared to authorize them.
Were looking at the Economic Zone in Hambantota and in the Western Province and also some other provinces. We are looking to invest at least US $ 5 billion over the next three to five years if the government decides to go ahead, Chinese Ambassador Yi Xianliang said.
Speaking at a bilateral trade discussion held at the National Chamber of Commerce of Sri Lanka (NCCSL) in Colombo, Xianliang noted that Chinese FDIs into Sri Lanka this year will run into several hundred million dollars.
Development Strategies and International Trade Minister Malik Samarawickrama had recently said that China had requested 15,000 acres of land in Hambantota to create an industrial park, which would create one million local jobscoincidentally an election promise of the Sri Lankan government.
He had said that the government is in the process of finding a suitable plot of land in the southern Sri Lankan town, which already has a large Chinese influence with the development of the so far underutilized Hambantota port and Mattala airport.
Sri Lanka is an important point in Chinas Maritime Silk Road, which is being developed to ensure its energy security from the oil fields of the Middle East to Chinese ports.
Xianliang assured that China has no opposition to letting companies from other countries, including India, from setting up operations within China-led projects.
We welcome any third party to join Sri Lanka and China. We are not opposed to India or any other country. China already has many business relationships with India, he said.
The Sri Lankan government is looking at setting up dozens of economic zones specializing in different industries across the island and is in talks with several countries including India, Japan and China to develop and manage these zones.
China is already the largest investor in Sri Lanka, owing to the US $ 1.4 billion Colombo International Financial Citypreviously known as the Colombo Port Citywhich will create additional US $ 8 billion in FDIs when the first phase is completed, and more FDIs years down the line.
The project had been halted when the current regime came into power in early 2015, citing inadequacies in environmental assessments conducted before starting the project.
However, the government, which came into power with a pro-West agenda, slowly started to warm up towards Chinawhich was the favoured ally of former President Mahinda Rajapaksaas FDIs and trade relations with the West suffered due to a weak global macroeconomic front.
Xianliang assured that China did not pressure the Sri Lankan government to resume the project, even though geopolitics had remained the centre stage behind the scenes, as it was revealed recently that the project had reportedly received immense opposition from India, which may have led to the postponement.
Everyone is talking about the environment and politics, but no one is talking about the 5,000 people who lost their jobs when the construction was stopped. Who is going to pay for them Xianliang asked.
China recently accepted an increased land area within the project, in exchange for not pushing for punitive damages for the delay and Xianliang said that the project would resume within one year.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said that it would resume within one year. The Port City will begin after the monsoon season, because it is hard to do construction with the weather. It will also take time to prepare 5,000 workers, he added. (Chandeepa Weththasinghe)

Educational policies should be taken by Govt not by students: Kiriella
	
Decisions with regard to educational policies should be taken by the Government and not the students, Higher Education and Highways Minister Lakshman Kiriella said today.
Issuing a statement, Minister Kiriella said the Government had provided all the facilities required by the university students including the increase of bursaries and student allowances.
Arrangements have been made to provide all university students with hostels facilities by 2018. Therefore the students have no problems to complain. The previous regime introduced a private university but protest marches are being held demanding to close it down five years later. No one opposed to SAITM Campus in Malabe when it was introduced, he added.
He said even though the previous regime introduced it the government has been unable to close this down because around 500-600 students are currently studying there.
I believe the Court will give a favourable verdict. We are ready to accept any decision given by the Courts," he added.

Expert stresses need to analyse FTA
	
An expert on international trade, yesterday, stressed the need to analyse the outcomes of the Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with India before opening up new sectors under a fresh agreement.
A former director general of commerce, P.D. Fernando told Daily Mirror that the FTA was a flawed agreement and implemented badly. As a result, he said, the countrys export sector was harmed, due to the removal of concessions that had been granted.
We should make projections of what exactly we would gain from a new agreement. We must analyse the net results of an FTA like India has done on India-Korea agreement," he said.
He said Trade Total Effect (TTE), Trade Diversion Effect (TDE), and Trade Creation Effect (TDE) as a percentage of TTE, should be calculated.
Commenting on the proposed Economic and Technology Cooperation Agreement (ETCA), he said it would be the first major agreement extending to services, investment, and economic cooperation. He said it would be a step that might discourage other trading partners who had the capacity to open their markets to Sri Lanka through similar agreements.
He noted the need to have proper parameters to access, analyse, evaluate and monitor the services.
We should negotiate a few parallel trade agreements for comparison and get the best for the country, owing to the experience with the current FTA, he said.
The best route for Sri Lanka is to strengthen present FTA and narrow the huge trade gap by facilitating exports. Positive results from this exercise would require and qualify us for a mega agreement, he said.
In India, Impact Analysis of FTAs has been instituted because it is important to review whether the concessions under these agreements are being gainfully utilised and have resulted in meaningful gains from market access. India also realises the value of simplifying and easing rules of origin criteria to position India effectively in global and regional value chains, he said. (Kelum Bandara)

Explosion at Kennedy Space Center ahead of rocket launch
	
There has been an explosion on the launch pad at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, US where the aerospace company SpaceX was readying an unmanned rocket for launch, BBC said today.
The cause of the blast is not clear and it is not known if anyone was hurt.
NASA said SpaceX was test-firing a rocket which was due to take a satellite into space this weekend.
Pictures from the scene show a huge plume of smoke rising above the Cape Canaveral complex.
The force of the blast shook buildings several miles away. Local emergency officials described the incident as a "catastrophic abort during a static test fire".
In a tweet, the Brevard County Emergency Management Office said there was no threat to the public.
SpaceX is seeking to create a new era of reusable rockets and affordable private space travel and has used its Falcon-9 rocket to take supplies to the International Space Station (ISS).
In April, the California-based company successfully landed a Falcon-9 on an ocean platform, after four previous attempts failed.

HNB strikes private placement deal with ADB
	
Hatton National Bank PLC (HNB), the countrys second largest private bank in terms of assets, has struck a private placement deal with the Manila-based development financier, Asian Development Bank (ADB), to strengthen its capital base.
To this end, HNB will issue ordinary voting shares of the bank to the value of US $ 50 million at the exchange rate existing at the time of the deal or ordinary voting shares equivalent to 9.9 percent of the total ordinary voting shares of the bank after the issue of such shares, whichever is lower, to ADB.
HNB will call an extraordinary general meeting (EGM) to obtain the shareholder acquiescence in this regard.
The shares will be issued at an average price at which the shares of HNB traded on the Colombo bourse during the 30-market day period immediately preceding the date of the EGM.
The shares will be issued at Rs.220 if the average price is more than Rs.220 and at Rs.190 if the average price is less than Rs.190.
The HNB share closed at Rs.187 on Wednesdays trading.
The board of directors has opined that the aforesaid consideration for which the ordinary voting shares of the bank are to be issued to ADB through a private placement is fair and reasonable to the bank and to all existing shareholders of the bank, a stock exchange filing by HNB said.
The bank said the proceeds of the private placement would be utilized to strengthen its capital base and support its overall business growth.
As of June 30, HNBs Tier I (core) capital adequacy ratio stood at 9.77 percent, down from 10.53 percent six months ago while Tier II capital adequacy was at 12.97 percent, slightly improved from 12.70 percent, helped by a Rs.7 billion debenture issue in March.
The bank recently announced another debenture issue up to Rs.6 billion to support its Tier II capital.
Apart from the shareholder nod, the private placement of shares is also subjected to the CSE approving the issue and listing of such shares and obtaining other governmental or regulatory approvals, HNB said. (Chandeepa Wettasinghe)

13 Indians test positive for zika In Singapore
	
Thirteen Indian nationals have tested positive for the Zika virus in Singapore, the Ministry of External Affairs has confirmed to NDTV.
"As per our High Commission in Singapore, 13 Indian nationals have tested positive for Zika virus in that country," External Affairs Ministry spokesperson Vikas Swarup said.
Foreign nationals including six Bangladeshis and 21 Chinese are among the 115 confirmed Zika infections in Singapore. The tiny island nation in the Indian Ocean has seen a surge in the number of Zika infections, after it declared its first case of a locally transmitted infection on August 27.
According to Singapore's Ministry of Health, instances of Zika infection have been reported by individuals who either resided or worked in Al Juneid or Sims Drive localities. The patients had not travelled abroad recently, thus confirming that they contracted the infection locally.
According to reports foreign construction workers in the city-state are the worst affected. However it is unclear whether the affected Indians work in the construction industry.
In February, the World Health Organisation had declared Zika a public health emergency. According to global health monitoring body, the virus is transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes, but can also spread through sexual contact. Its symptoms include mild fever, rashes on the body, joint ache, muscle spasms and severe headaches.
Infection in pregnant women can sometimes cause microcephaly, a rare birth defect in which infants are born with an abnormally small head. (NDTV)

Int'l Community no longer insisting in foreign judges
	
The United Nations, the European Union, other global agencies and the international community are no longer insisting on a so called credible domestic inquiry with the participation of foreign judges, Cabinet spokesman and Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne said yesterday.
He told the weekly Cabinet news briefing that if the Mahinda Rajapaksa regime was in power, the world community would have been breathing down Sri Lanka's neck demanding for an international investigation into alleged war crimes and the violation of the International Humanitarian Law during the final stages of the humanitarian operation. This would have been in line with recommendations made by the Darusman report and agreement reached between then President Mahinda Rajapaksa and the UN.
Not only had the unity government restored democracy, the rule of law, independence of the judiciary and introduced the concept of good governance but it had restored Sri Lankas dignity, prestige and self respect within the global community which was on the verge of branding Sri Lanka as a pariah State, the minister said. This is why President Maithripala Sirisena is being invited by world leaders for official visits and highly prestigious world summits like the G-7 and commended at international forums as a champion of democracy and a fighter against corruption."
Responding to a journalist on the numerous foreign visits undertaken by ex-president Mahinda Rajapaksa, he said it was natural for former heads of states to receive invitations.
"I think in this instance, Mahinda Rajapaksa embarks on these foreign tours as a means of getting away from the likes of Wimal Weerawansa and Udaya Gammanpila, he said. (Sandun A Jayasekera)

In the event of a surgery, the benefit to a customer is Rs.200,000. Catering to every stage in the customers life cycle, Seylan Sure is an undeniably value product for every customer. In enhanced amounts for new categories, customers children passing the Grade Five scholarship exams will receive Rs.50,000, as well as students who have passed their O/L with 8As and A/L with 3As. Further, a cash gift of Rs.50,000 will be awarded to customers celebrating their 10th wedding anniversary.
Commenting on the exciting new Seylan Sure scheme, Seylan Bank Deputy General Manager Marketing and Personal Banking Tilan Wijeyesekera said, We are delighted to relaunch Seylan Sure with breakthrough benefits in the industry. By increasing the value of the cash gifts awarded to account holders from Rs.15,000 previously to Rs.200,000 today, we provide the highest value and benefits to our customers.

Three 'protest' petitions handed over to UN
	
The Joint Opposition, the collective of National Organizations headed by Ven. Akmeemana Dayarathna Thera and Ven. Iththe Kande Saddhatissa Thera and the Janasetha Peramuna today handed over three petitions to the United Nations (UN) office in Colombo to be handed over to UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon urging the international community not to interfere in the internal affairs of Sri Lanka.
The collective of National Organizations including a group of Buddhist monks staged a protest displaying posters condemning the intervention of the United Nations in the internal matters of the country.
Police personnel at the UN office in Colombo prevented the monks from approaching the UN office and handed over a court order banning any protest outside the UN office.
However, the monks were allowed to hand over the petition to a representative of the UN office after they promised to behave decently.
Ven. Dayarathana Thera said the UN had turned a blind eye to the issues of the Sinhalese and alleged that the UN kept quiet when Sinhalese, Tamils and Muslims were attacked by the LTTE terrorists during the war. They did not pay any attention to any human rights violation at that time, the Thera said.
Meanwhile, Joint Opposition MP Bandula Gunawardane who arrived at the UN office to hand over a petition said the UN had no mandate to get involved in the internal affairs of a sovereign nation.
We wish to remind that, since the conflict in Sri Lanka has been categorised as a non-International Armed Conflict, the UNHRC has no mandate to resolve that mechanism be set up relating to International Humanitarian Law that governs Armed Conflict, he said.
Vested interests are now using all possible agencies and instruments of the UN in a humiliating manner to break up the sovereign state and the independent nation of Sri Lanka, the petition said.
Joint Opposition MPs Sisira Jayakody and Weerakumara Dissanayake were also present at the occasion. (Ajith Siriwardana)

Unregistered motorcycles - Four months grace period for registration
	
To prevent unregistered motorcycles being used for illegal purposes such as highway robberies, snatching of gold chains, hit and run accidents and in an effort to collect a large amount of unpaid registration fees, the Cabinet on Tuesday approved a grace period of four months for their registration.
Transport and Civil Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva, who presented the Cabinet memo said there were several unregistered motorcycles being used in rural areas where public transport was not available.
He said they contributed to the rural agricultural economy and self-employment and an opportunity should be afforded to the owners to register their vehicles on an imposition of a surcharge.
The charges will be based on the engine cubic capacity -- Rs. 10,000, for cubic capacity 0 cm to 50 cms, Rs.20,000 for a cubic capacity of 51 cms to 100 cms, Rs.30,000 for a cubic capacity of 101 cms.
The minister said because in most instances legal documents were not available for registering these motor cycles, there was the habit of submitting forged documents for registration purposes. (Sandun A Jayasekera)

Young website hacker might get pardon: Minister
	
President Maithripala Sirisena will pardon the young website hacker, the 17 year old schoolboy who allegedly entered to the presidential website illegally and hacked it last week, Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said today.
He told the media at his office that President Sirisena was a person who never harboured hatred towards anyone and was compassionate to all and therefore he didnt think President Sirisena would refuse if there was a request from the students family to pardon him on sympathetic grounds.
The request must come from his family to the President for a pardon after the formal inquiries on the illegal cyber trespassing and court investigations are over, he said.
Responding to a journalist he said a presidential pardon was granted to the LTTE cadre who attempted on his life and the Tamil girl who desecrated Sigiriya murals on a request made by families of both offenders and added that the law must take its course first before considering any request or granting of a pardon.
The schoolboy has been produced before Colombo Chief Magistrate by the Police and placed under probation until today. (Sandun A Jayasekera)

Youth involvement crucial for SLs social justice: UN Chief
	
Visiting UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, today, emphasised the importance of the involvement of young people and women in peacebuilding approaches to ensure sustainable social justice, especially in post-conflict countries like Sri Lanka.
Addressing an event titled, Reconciliation and Coexistence: Role of Youth, in Galle, the Secretary-General said the UN was building more and stronger partnerships with youth-led and youth-focused organisations to promote peace and development.
I have also been trying to put right one of the most serious injustices: the exclusion of young people from peace building and reconciliation processes. Why should young people be sent off to fight wars, but be prevented from building peace he asked.
He said it was important to increase investment in the young women and men who make up one fifth of Sri Lankas population since the youth are the biggest asset of the country, and Sri Lankas future success depends on them.
He also said that most of the young people in the country were born and lived their early lives during conflict, terror and displacement.
Many of you suffered deprivation and injustice. Involvement in peace building, reconciliation and post-conflict transformation provide an opportunity to emerge from this trauma to play a part in creating a better future, he said.
He went on to note that young people around the world were often depicted as potential terrorists and easy prey for recruitment by violent extremists.
This distorted picture ignores the reality that the vast majority of young people want to be part of the solution to violent extremism. In Sri Lanka and around the world, young people long for peace and security, and are among the most ardent proponents of human rights, he told the youths who attended the event which was organised by the National Youth Services Council (NYSC), the Ministry of National Policies and Economic Affairs, the Office for National Unity and Reconciliation (ONUR), and the United Nations in Sri Lanka.
