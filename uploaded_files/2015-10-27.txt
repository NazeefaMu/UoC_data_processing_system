Syrian presidency seeks end to terrorism
	
The Syrian presidency said today political initiatives could not work in Syria before terrorism had been wiped out, sticking by its long-held position on how to end the war after its Russian allies called for new elections.
The presidency said in a statement it was clarifying reports that President Bashar al-Assad had told a Russian delegation on Sunday he would be ready to hold early parliamentary and presidential elections called for by his allies in Moscow.
The Russian foreign minister, in an interview broadcast on Saturday, said Syrians needed to prepare for both parliamentary and presidential elections, part of an effort by Moscow to advance a political track towards ending the conflict.
In a statement, the presidency said the Syrian state would welcome any political solution approved by the Syrian people that preserves national unity. (REUTERS)

Taliban encourage Afghan quake relief as toll rises
	
The Taliban encouraged aid groups to help victims of the massive earthquake in northern Afghanistan and Pakistan as rescuers struggled to form a clear picture of the damage caused by the disaster as the death toll passed 300.
With large mountainous areas of Afghanistan hit and icy weather closing in, the unstable security situation has posed a major challenge to international aid groups that have been repeatedly targeted by insurgents.
But the Taliban, which have driven their Islamist campaign against the Western-backed government in Kabul across the country this year, indicated they would not stand in the way of aid efforts and ordered fighters to help victims.
"The Islamic Emirate calls on our good-willed countrymen and charitable organizations to not hold back in providing shelter, food and medical supplies to the victims," the group said in a message of condolence to quake victims, using its formal name. (REUTERS)

Their extravagant taste nettles employees!
	
This is a government-owned undertaking that can be run at a profit, but like other government-owned enterprises it is eternally in the red due to the twin commonplace evil ? corruption and mismanagement ? an inevitable outcome of political interference.?
Meanwhile, a loud cry is heard from the Sapugaskanda area that a move is afoot to purchase two de luxe limousines each for the Ministerial one and the fair Deputy in charge of this undertaking. What has ruffled the employees of this undertaking is the enormity of the extravagant taste of the Ministerial duo who have already got several luxury cars and jeeps at their disposal!
The directorate of this statutory body eager to please their new political bosses has approved the purchase in double quick time, they say.

There?s another in the same boat with her!
	
?<U+200B>This good-looking fair Diyawanna member recently met a friendly high-ranking diplomat at a chancery of a European country in the city to seek his advice and help to get over a big problem she faced. ?
Explaining her problem to the diplomat, the fair one said: ?I?ve managed to make it to Diyawanna for the first time and the nearest rival whom I beat in the race is exploiting this issue in a bid to grab my seat in the House. I know nothing about your country?s law?Please help me to sort out this problem.?
The diplomat who gave the fair one a patient hearing said: ?You say that you have no understanding of our law. I must say that I don?t understand how the law in your country operates either!?
?I don?t understand what you mean. Why don?t you be more explicit?? the fair Diyawanna member asked. ?
The diplomat said: ?There is another member in your council holding the citizenship of our country, but it has not adversely affected his status as a member of your council. What I don?t understand is why the law that does not apply to him should apply to you!??
The good-looking one looked amazed and her amazement soon gave way to sheer joy. ?Gee, what a break!? she exclaimed. ?Who is he? Please tell me??
?It is left to you to find out who the person is,? the diplomat replied.
No amount of coaxing and sweet talk could get the name out of the diplomat, they say.

They beg forgiveness to avert loss of office
	
The government top brass recently came under pressure from friendly sources to dissolve two local bodies close to the city to send home summarily their political heads sans their plume. The sources that proposed this measure maintained that it would be a good lesson for these two heads for hurling invective at the new strongman at the recent polls.?
As the rumour about the proposed dissolution made rounds, some people in Dehiwela and Moratuwa areas had celebrated the likely event by lighting firecrackers, they say.
Meanwhile, on hearing this rumour, the two local body heads got in a sweat. They immediately met to decide on a course of action to avert the impending calamity.?
The twosome realized that they were quite helpless and their survival in power depended on the mercy of the new Big Boss.?
So they called on the new Big Boss and fell at his feet. ?Sir, please forgive us for things we said about you at the election time. We are prepared to suffer any punishment you impose on us. But Sir, please, don?t deprive us of our party membership and present position,? they beseeched.
Deeply touched by the pathetic spectacle of the contrite twosome, the new Big Boss had consoled them saying: ?Now? now?let us forget the past??
However, only time will say whether the new Big Boss has really forgiven them, they say.

They demand probe into Rs.70 million documentary affair
	
The story about a former high official of a state regulatory body who had to lose his job following the expose that he had misused public funds to the tune of Rs.70 million on the production of a documentary to promote and foster national reconciliation is now in the public domain.?
Some say the scandal would have remained under wraps at least for some time if he had played ball with the new high authorities after the regime change. He had instead ignored a series of instructions that had come from above, they say.
In one instance, he had disregarded a request from a VVIP to set right an injustice done to a certain media outfit. Meanwhile, another high authority had found reason to pass a stricture on him. It was at this stage, the issue relating to the Rs.70 million teledrama had surfaced, they say.
By the way, the scandal relating to the Rs.70 million documentary took a back seat when both this official and his boss who occupied the chair of the same statutory body had to face charges that they had misappropriated public money amounting to Rs.60 million for distributing white clothing among ?sil? devotees in the run up to the January 8 Presidential poll. The case in this regard is now pending in courts.
Meanwhile, employees of the statutory body in question are said to be wondering why the law enforcement authorities have so far failed to take action against the official in connection with the documentary affair

This Ministerial one the other day paid a visit to the Mattala airport to inspect the warehouse facility now turned into a paddy store. Print and electronic media teams were present on invitation to cover his visit.
After the inspection he addressed the media personnel: ?What has happened should not have happened. This airport is a precious gift our government offered to the people in the South. Now that the damage is already done, they should pay us a monthly rental for using this airport storage facility.?
The Ministerial one changed his tune the moment the video cameras stopped whirring and flashlights were out.?
He was saying: ?It should be obvious to anyone that this airport is an utter waste of public money. What a foolish thing to construct airports in backwoods like this! ?Our former Lokka didn?t want to listen to sense!?
The Ministerial one?s off-the-record comment went on record as some of the video cameras were still running and he was blissfully unaware of it.

A misadventure and a tell-tale sarong
	
This veteran politician hailing from a district adjoining the Colombo district is one of the seniors in the Diyawanna council. Now holding Ministerial rank, the politico is well known as a ladies? man, ready for romantic escapades undeterred by disabilities imposed by age. In fact, his pastime is enjoying the company of comely lasses!
A highly embarrassing misadventure this politico had to go through recently was said to be causing titters and guffaws in political circles these days, they say.
The politico recently moved into a familiar holiday inn along with a young woman to spend the weekend.?
Come the night, the elderly politico enjoyed the bedtime together with the fair companion thanks to the drug that makes things hard and upright.?
The man had his fill to his heart?s contentment and now he wanted to have a sound sleep. But the sleep was slow in coming and to his horror he discovered that what he wanted to be hard and upright had failed to come back to normal.?
Time was past 12.30. Highly ruffled, the Ministerial one woke up the sleeping beauty and explained to her the plight he was in.?
They realized what had gone wrong. He had taken an overdose of the drug! The practical-minded woman suggested that he should immediately see a doctor at the nearest hospital.?
?How can I see a doctor about this problem?? he wailed. The young woman had her guts. ?Now don?t worry,? she told him. ?Now get into this sarong. You can?t wear the trouser in this condition,? she gave the highly disconcerted politico precise instructions.?
The fair companion rushed the politico to a private hospital in the Narahenpita area in her own car. Later she got a room reserved for the ?patient?. A young doctor on night duty soon examined the ladies? man lying on a bed and gave him an injection. ?Son, now you know the truth. Please don?t breathe a word about this to anyone,? he beseeched the young doctor. However, the medicine administered by injection failed to produce the expected result and the young doctor sought the help of a senior colleague.
The senior doctor, they say, had drawn some blood using a syringe and what was defiantly hard and upright had gradually come back to the normal position.
Happy that the problem was over, the politico hastily dressed up, paid the hospital bill and looked for his lady love, but she had faded from the scene. ?
The Ministerial one summoned his security detail and returned to his official residence as if he was back after a tiring tight schedule outstation. ??
However, he had failed to cover his back trail with no clue to his night misadventure for he had left behind his tell-tale sarong in the hospital room where the doctors treated him. ??

Devananda to stand trial for 1987 murder in Chennai
	
Former Sri Lankan minister Douglas Devananda is all set to stand trial before a Chennai Court through video conferencing from Colombo in 28-year-old murder case, Times of India said.
It was in the preceding night of Diwali in 1987 that Douglas and nine other Sri Lankan Tamils were involved in a shootout at Choolaimedu in Chennai. One person was killed in the incident. Though all were arrested, they absconded after being released on bail.
Non-bailable arrest warrant was issued against Douglas who later became a minister in Rajapaksa government.
At the end of civil war in 2009, he was part of a diplomatic delegation visiting India and calling on the President and Prime Minister.
At that time the TOI has exposed the fact that he was supposed to be an absconding accused with an NBW pending against him. But due to his diplomatic immunity, he was not arrested during the visit.
He didn't return to India after that. However, he moved courts for cancellation of the NBW. On September 10, 2014 Justice C. T. Selvam of Madras High Court permitted him to stand trial through video conferencing.
On Tuesday, city public prosecutor M. L. Japan filed a petition before additional sessions Judge M. Shanthi seeking to split the case and conduct trial against Douglas who has been cited as third accused in the case.
All the remaining nine accused are still absconding.
Now the case will be split and trial will be held only against Douglas. Others will face trial as and when they are nabbed and brought in court.
In his order, Justice Selvam has said Douglas should appear in the office of high commissioner of India in Colombo, Sri Lanka, for video conferencing as and when it is required.
Referring to his status and attempts made on his life, the judge said: "At every instance when the petitioner is required to appear before the trial court in person, the state shall afford him appropriate protection."
"This order is passed in the peculiar circumstances of the case given the diplomatic status and the effect execution of a non-bailable warrant issued against a minister of the neighbouring state, may entail. This order shall not be seen as a precedent," he said.

Electronic NIC from January: Ravi K.
	
Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake said yesterday that plans were afoot to issue electronic national identity cards to all citizens of Sri Lanka using the state of the art technology employed by developed countries of the world.
The Minister said that priority would be accorded to this programme at the national budget in consideration of its importance to the overall development strategy of the Government.
The programme was all set to get off the ground in January and the existing NIC would be converted into an electronic identity card.
?All relevant information of a child since birth will be included in the new ID and until he/she reaches the age of 16 and the identity card number will be assigned to him/her and at the completion of sixteen years and the new electronic NIC will be issued. This programme will be conducted by the Department of Registration of Persons in collaboration with the Information Communication Technology Agency,? the Minister said.
He said the Government had decided to embark on this plan for enhanced efficiency and convenience of all activities concurrent to the other development processes of the country and added that It would enable the maintenance of a single data base in respect of each individual and pave the way for the authentication of the identity with all the required details of the citizen.
Minister Karunanayake pointed out that the new ID card would make banking and other services easily accessible and could be used for easy verification of facts in issuing driving licences, passports and similar services.
It would also ensure the provision of relief services of the Government only to the deserving people and help to eliminate corruption and fraudulent practices usually associated with such services though a strict observation mechanism, according to the Minister.
Electronic identity cards were used in many developed countries, and our closest neighbour India launched a programme to issue electronic identity cards to its citizens five years ago. The same technology was used in the United States in issuing the social security card to its citizens.

Mysterious space object heading towards SL sea: Report
	
A mysterious chunk of space debris will hit Earth off the coast of Sri Lanka on November 13, Russia Today news channel said. Scientists have no clear idea what it is, other than that it is likely artificial in origin, and have dubbed the object WT1190F.
The object, dubbed WTF1190F, is set to land in the Indian Ocean, around 40 miles (65km) off the southern tip of Sri Lanka, at 6:20 UTC.
It measures up to 7ft (2 metres) long and it could be a piece of rocket stage from a recent lunar mission, or even part of an Apollo program craft that has been in space for more than 40 years.
?It?s a lost piece of space history that?s come back to haunt us,? Jonathan McDowell, an astrophysicist at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, has told Nature.
Detected by the Catalina Sky Survey, an observation lab at the University of Tucson, the alleged piece of space debris initially puzzled observers. But astronomers then went back through the lab?s past images from telescopes, and noticed that it had been present at least since 2012.
From then on they calculated the orbit of the object, which has been circling the Earth at a longer orbit than the Moon, and deduced that the piece of cosmic refuse was likely placed there by man.
?To fit the solar radiation pressure effects on its orbit you need to assume a high area-to-mass ratio ? implying the thing is hollow, like an empty rocket stage would be,? McDowell told Popular Mechanics.
?So it has the right size and properties, and it is in an orbit which would be surprising for a natural object (whizzing around the Earth-Moon system) but where we know there are a bunch of pieces of space junk.?
Astrophysicists believe that the object could even be a memento of the Apollo missions that took US astronauts to the moon. But scientists may never discover for sure: WT1190F?s re-entry into the atmosphere would likely burn up most of the debris, before dumping it in an extremely remote spot.
?It's coming in fast and will get very hot ? it?s possible a few dense parts of say a rocket engine will survive to impact the ocean,? said McDowell of its potential disintegration, before warning that he ?would not necessarily want to be going fishing directly underneath it.?
But scientists are also using the arrival of WT1190F to simulate a different situation ? that of an asteroid or a large projectile hurtling towards Earth. Alerts will be raised, and multiple labs will track the debris in real-time, though there will be no need to warn the military, or send Bruce Willis into space.
?What we planned to do seems to work. But it?s still three weeks to go,? Gerhard Drolshagen, who manages the European Space Agency?s near-Earth objects office, told Nature.
Although this is the first instance of a piece of space debris being tracked as it returns to Earth, WT1190F is not a one-off. Among all recognized space junk, there are 86 unknown objects crossing the lunar orbit, mostly lunar probes, or parts of rockets.
There are also dozens of others floating uncontrollably in outer space, of which McDowell says about 20 are being observed from Earth. These will likely outlast most objects on Earth, and would possibly be the first harbinger of our civilization to be witnessed by any other species in our universe. (RT & Daily Mail)

Sampath Bank?s IT innovations receive international recognition
	
Sampath Bank representatives receive the Runner-up Award for Product and Service Innovation at Infosys Finacle Global Banking Innovation Awards 2015?
Sampath Bank, a name synonymous with innovation in Sri Lanka?s financial sector, was duly recognized for technological innovation when its Cardless Cash product was honoured with the Runner-up award for ?Product and Service Innovation? at BAI - Infosys Finacle Global Banking Innovation Awards 2015 held in Bangalore, India recently.?
BAI - Infosys Finacle Global Banking Innovation Awards 2015 is an annually held event to recognize the world?s most innovative financial services companies positively impacting the profitability, efficiency and customer experience in the retail banking industry around the world.?
??At Sampath Bank, we have always focussed our efforts on technological innovation in order to present a convenient banking experience to our customers. Since the introduction of the multi-point network of automated teller machines (ATMs) and the popular SET card in 1988, we have introduced many innovations in multiple areas that matter most to the customers.?
Our Cardless Cash product is one such innovation that was purely conceptualized on customer convenience. It is indeed encouraging to be recognized on an international platform such as the BAI - Infosys Finacle Global Banking Awards and we are humbly proud of this great achievement,?? said Sampath Bank Chief Manager IT Ananda Wijitha.?
Sampath Cardless Cash allows customers to perform ATM transactions without the use of an ATM card. While ATM transactions are usually processed through identification of the customer by the ATM card followed by the authentication of the customer by the personal identification number (PIN), this groundbreaking Sampath Cardless Cash product breaks this normality with the offering of two options for the customer, which are the ATM card PIN option and One Time Pin option (OTP). ? ? ??
The ATM card PIN option simply requires customers to provide their National Identity Card number excluding the last digit followed by the PIN used for the ATM card. As the NIC number is a unique sequence of numbers assigned to every Sri Lankan citizen, the link between the NIC and the ATM card is therefore used for the purpose of transactions during which the NIC number entered on the ATM is converted to an ATM card transaction through internal data.?
On the other hand, the One Time Pin option further gives customers the opportunity to initiate a cardless cash transaction in the event the customer has forgotten his ATM card. This life-saving option allows customers to request an OTP via mobile phone enabling the customer to initiate a cardless cash transaction via mobile phone. ?
Now in its fifth year, Infosys Finacle Global Banking Innovation Awards is a global awards programme that honours pioneering financial services companies that accelerate innovation, create leading products and enhance customer experience. With more than 250 nominations submitted from over 34 countries, the BAI - Infosys Finacle Global Banking Innovation Awards recognizes winners in nine significant categories.?
Winners are selected by the BAI - Infosys Finacle Innovation Circle Judging Panel, a distinguished international group of prominent industry thought leaders and retail banking professionals who evaluate the nominations based on originality and impact. This prestigious global awards programme provides organisations with a platform and opportunity to showcase their vision, discipline and resources in developing revolutionary innovations that are positively making a difference for customers.?
Further remarking on this significant achievement, Wijitha said, ?At Sampath Bank, we place utmost importance on developing products and services that exclusively cater to customer convenience, one of the prime needs of a satisfied customer. We further make it a point to commit and go beyond the norms of the banking industry to continuously etch the values of customers in the heart of all the operations carried out by the bank.?

Angry China says shadowed US warship near man-made islands
	
A U.S. Navy guided-missile destroyer sailed close to China's man-made islands in the disputed South China Sea on Tuesday, drawing an angry rebuke from Beijing, which said its warships tracked and warned the American vessel.
The patrol by the USS Lassen was the most significant U.S. challenge yet to the 12-nautical-mile territorial limits China asserts around the islands in the Spratly archipelago and could ratchet up tension in one of the world's busiest shipping lanes.
One U.S. defense official said the USS Lassen sailed within 12 nautical miles of Subi Reef. A second defense official said the mission, which lasted a few hours, included Mischief Reef and would be the first in a series of freedom-of-navigation exercises aimed at testing China's territorial claims.
A Chinese guided-missile destroyer and a naval patrol ship shadowed and gave warnings to the U.S. warship "according to law", China's Defense Ministry said in statements on its website, adding that the military would take all necessary steps to protect the country's security. (REUTERS)

SL, India commence joint naval exercise
	
The Joint Naval Exercise SLINEX, organised by the Sri Lanka Navy and the Indian Navy was commenced today in the seas off Trincomalee.
Six naval ships and six Fast Attack Craft of Sri Lanka Navy along with three ships of Indian Navy are taking part in this year?s joint training which will be concluded on November 1.
The Sri Lanka Navy said in a statement that this exercise paves the way for operational effectiveness through common understanding of neighbouring navies.
?The joint exercise concerns on maintaining effective maritime security in the region by integrating forces through cooperation, coordination and collaboration. This leads to mutual understanding of limitations and capabilities, to enhance service interoperability and system compatibility in countering challenges,? the Navy said.
It said that it was a great opportunity for both the Navies to rehearse and improve capabilities such as cross deck operations, replenishment at sea and information sharing. The marines will also carry out coordinated helicopter operations at sea during the exercise.
The Sri Lankan Navy appreciated Indian Navy?s role in the joint naval exercise and said they have been a great mentor of Sri Lanka Navy in many maritime aspects.
?Regular joint exercises have facilitated both the navies to gradually and systematically develop professionalism through these interactions,? the Navy said.

## Title: Sri Lanka ready for El Ni?o

Sri Lanka ready for El Ni?o
	
Sri Lankan officials say the country is prepared to face the El Ni?o weather phenomenon in the last quarter of 2015 and take precautions based on the experience of the recent past.
Temperatures have remained above average this year and a prolonged dry spell has left over 200,000 in the Northern Province thirsting for safe drinking water. But, officials at the Meteorological Department (MD) and the Disaster Management Centre (DMC) say the impacts are manageable.
According to global weather forecasts the periodic warming of the Pacific Ocean called El Ni?o has now set in with most predicting it to be similar in strength to an occurrence in 1997. ?The strong El Ni?o is expected to last until at least the end of the year before declining in the first quarter of 2016,? the Australian Bureau of Meteorology said in an update on 13 October.
However, some assessments also predict that South Asia was likely to receive above average rains in late 2015. ?Countries on the equator can expect more rain, flooding and higher sea levels as El Ni?o takes hold,? the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs says.
?We have analysed? past weather patterns when El Ni?o was active and what we have seen is that in the last quarter of the year rains, in fact, increase in this part of the globe,? says L. Chandrapala, director-general of the MD. ?More rains in the last quarter of the year would be welcome following a weak South West Monsoon ? the monsoon was below 75 per cent this year.?
The failure of the rains and high temperatures have caused ground water resources to dwindle in the Northern Province. Over the last two months, the DMC has been supporting local authorities to deliver water to the worst-hit communities.
But, Chandrapala says Sri Lanka is now better prepared to deal with fluctuating climate trends that have resulted in frequent extreme weather events. ?It is about long-term planning ? we are better prepared than we were five years back.?
?So far, there is no sign that things will worsen, we have not received any warnings from the MD or the agriculture department of major crop losses,? Pradeep Koddiplili, DMC deputy director, tells SciDev.Net.
Sri Lanka has seen five major floods and four major droughts since 2010, attributed by changing climate.
