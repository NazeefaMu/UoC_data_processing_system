Call for new political party: Ex UPFA LG members
	
A bulk of former United People?s Freedom Alliance (UPFA) local government members, at a special summit, called for the formation of a new political party as an alternative to the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP), informed sources said today.
The SLFP is the largest and key ally of the UPFA. The UPFA is virtually divided at the moment with one faction switching its allegiance to former President Mahinda Rajapaksa and the other to President Maitripala Sirisena. According to sources, nearly 2500 members who served in the dissolved local authorities or are serving in the functioning ones, attended the summit.
The members representing each district including Jaffna, Vavuniya and Mullaitivu spoke at the event, and asked for a new political party under the leadership of Mr. Rajapaksa. They reportedly said Mr. Rajapaksa was deceived twice by the present SLFP hierarchy and therefore he should not fall into any political trap in the future.
Mr. Rajapaksa said in response, ?Now, the SLFP authorities have initiated disciplinary action against you. Whenever you are expelled from the party, there should be a place for you to turn to. Wherever you stand, I will be with you.?
Former Chief Justice Sarath N.Silva was also present at the occasion.
Former Minister Basil Rajapaksa, Mahajana Eksath Peramuna Leader Dinesh Gunawardane, MPs Pavitra Wanniarachchi, Geetha Kumarasinghe and others attended the event.
The event is seen as yet another step forward in the direction of forming a new political party. Mr. Rajapaksa opened a political coordinating office in Colombo last Friday in this respect.

CID quizzes GMOA over 'printing mistake'
	
Weeks after the Indian media claimed that of an alleged kidney racket where Sri Lankan doctors were involved in, the doctors of the Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) are now under a cloud because of an investigation launched by the Crimes Investigations Department (CID) over a ?printing mistake? in a booklet launched by the GMOA in 2012.
The GMOA had launched the booklet titled ?Establishment of Specialist registry and introduction of an evolution procedure for foreign medical specialists? on hazards of unqualified Indian doctors? practicing in Sri Lankan private hospitals.
The booklet has come out parallel to a programme of the GMOA with the collaboration of the Health Ministry which was then held by President Maithripala Sirisena.
The GMOA Secretary Dr. Nalinda Herath, said he had been questioned last Friday (12) over the ?printing mistake? and according to the sources, the President of the GMOA Dr. Anuruddha Padeniya would also be questioned in the coming days.
The questioning of the GMOA Secretary by the CID has taken place in the following day after a protest was launched by the United Professionals? Movement consisting of professionals in the government sector including the GMOA members.
Speaking to the Daily Mirror, Dr. Nalinda Herath said they were doubtful as to why it took 4 years for the CID to launch an investigation into the matter.
He suspected that the move was an attempt of the government to silent the government sector doctors for opposing the proposed Indo-Sri Lanka Economic and Technology Co-operative Agreement (ETCA) from which doors will be open for Indians in Sri Lankan fields.
?The GMOA had launched the booklet and an evolution process after a number of heart patients has come to the national hospitals with complications in their open-heart surgeries carried out in private hospitals by unqualified Indian doctors who call them specialists. Then Health Minister Maithripala Sirisena also praised our programme. We are doubtful about the sudden CID investigation,? Dr. Herath said.
?The first attempt to tarnish our reputation was the alleged kidney racket. Now, it is a printing mistake. We condemn this move and we are informing the President Maithripala Sirisena regarding the matter through a letter,? he said.
He said that according to sources, the complaint to the CID over the printing mistake had been lodged by a political supporter of a powerful minister in the current government. The sources had informed the GMOA that the CID had received telephone calls from the Prime Minister?s Office urging to start investigation as soon as possible.
However, the GMOA stated that unless the government takes action to stop curbing the doctors of the GMOA, they will be contemplating on an island wide strike action without prior notice.

Eight former LG heads to defy party instructions
	
The eight former local authorities? heads, facing disciplinary inquiries by the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLF), said they would defy the party?s instructions.
Addressing a group press briefing, they were again critical of the present SLFP leadership.
?Someone who acted with the United National Party (UNP) to defeat our candidate at the election is now calling for explanations from us. Explanations have to be called for those who acted with the UNP, not from us,? Former Chairman of Walallawita Pradeshiya Sabha Udeni Atukorale said.
He said, ?We learnt that the SLFP Central Committee has decided to initiate disciplinary inquiries against us. Explanations have been called from us. Before conducting such inquiries against us, explanation has to be called from the General Secretary who served in the party before January 8, 2015. The former General Secretary and the present General Secretary both quit the party and teamed up with the UNP to defeat the party.?
He said none of these eight members had betrayed the party. He accused party seniors Nimal Siripala de Silva, Dilan Perera and others of conspiring against former President Mahinda Rajapaksa to entrust the party chairmanship with President Maitripala Sirisena. (Muditha Dayananda)

The Pakistan Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) Director Akbar Hoti on Saturday allowed the investigation team to visit the United Kingdom (UK) and Sri Lanka to collect evidence for the murder of British-Pakistani politician Imran Farooq.
Imran Farooq, the founding member of the Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM), was murdered in Edgware, northwest London in September 2010. He had claimed asylum in Britain in 1999 as he was wanted in Pakistan in many cases of torture and murder.
Three accused, including Khalid Shamim, Moazzam Ali and Kashif Khan Kamran are currently on judicial remand at Adiala Jail in Rawalpindi. According to sources, Khalid Shamim and Mohsin Ali had already recorded their confessional statements, while Moazzam Ali - who is said to be the prime suspect - was unwilling to do so.
Mohsin, in his statement, stated that Moazzam had handled their travel documents to visit the UK. He said they had monitored the movements and activities of Dr Farooq in London to know about his routine. On the day of the murder, he grabbed Dr Farooq while Kashif stabbed him and then bludgeoned him with a brick, he said. (Daily Times)
