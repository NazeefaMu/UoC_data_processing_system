ACPBA bus strike from Sunday
	
An islandwide bus strike would be launched from Sunday, July 3 midnight, All Ceylon Private Bus Owners Association (ACPBA) Secretary Anjana Priyanjith said today.
He confirmed that their island-wide bus strike would be held as planned from midnight July 3 since the authorities had failed address their demands.
Addressing a press conference held at the Narahenpita Womens Research and Training Centre, Priyanjith said yesterday there were no discussions arranged by the National Transport Commission (NTC) as claimed.
All arrangements have been made to launch the island-wide strike. There is no turning back without increasing the minimum bus fare by Rs. 2 and other fares by 15 percent by July 1. We gave a two-week notice to relevant authorities, he said.
He said they were not agreeable to the 3.2 and the 6 percent bus fare increments by the NTC.
He said the bus fare revision had been made without considering relevant criteria or having any discussion with bus operators.
He said it seemed that Gemunu Wijeratne of Lanka Private Bus Owners' Association (LPBOA) had made deals with the Government and trying to forget the bus fare increment.
If Gemunu is ready to make deals with the Government, he will see what will happen on July 3. There is no room to destroy the private bus industry by entering into deals with the Yahapalanaya Government. He also had connections with the previous regime as well, Anjana Priyanjith said.

Allegations against Mahendran should be proven to act on him: PM
	
Allegations against Central Bank Governor Arjuna Mahendran should be proven for the government to take action against him, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said today.
A three-member committee was appointed to investigate the allegations against Mr Mahendran. They decided he was correct. Then the police carried out an investigation and they said there were no facts to file a case against him. Then a fundamental rights petition against Mr Mahendran was filed and that was dismissed by courts while the Committee on Public Enterprises ( COPE) is currently carrying out an investigation, he said during an interview with Independent Television Network (ITN).
I dont have an intention of defending any one. The allegations against Mr. Mahendran should be proven in order to take action against him. But I won't hesitate to take action against Mr Mahendran if the allegations are proven, he added.
The Prime Minister was responding to a question posed to him by the ITN.
Mr Wickremeisnghe said the allegation against Mr. Mahendran was in connection to a bond issue.
We are currently carrying out investigations on this allegation and it is done in a transparent manner, he said.

## Title: Beware of Capital Gains Tax: MR

Beware of Capital Gains Tax: MR
	
Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa yesterday rejected the Governments justification that the VAT increment was necessary to pay off the loans taken by the former Government.
He was referring to advertisements in media stating that the increment was necessary to settle the loans taken his Government.
Issuing a statement, Mr. Rajapaksa said they had always ensured that the borrowings were kept within manageable limits.
Mr. Rajapaksa said it could be seen that the increase in the Value Added Tax (VAT) had run into a great deal of opposition country wide.
He also said the owners of small and medium businesses and traders in many towns, had come out onto the streets, against this tax increment with the support of the general public.
It should be borne in mind that my Government did not take loans for consumption. We obtained loans to carry out the war against terrorism and to develop infrastructure, which can be used by our people for decades if not centuries, he said.
What we have built can be seen all over the country. Leaders of this Government are still opening only the projects that my Government commenced. One Minister publicly acknowledged this fact recently. Whenever we took out any loans for a project, it was done carefully in a planned manner, which is why we never had to contend with an unmanageable piling up of debt, he added.
He said the Government was looking for more ways to tax the people.
He also said that the Government had announced that a Capital Gains Tax would be introduced in the coming weeks on the grounds that people had accumulated a lot of wealth in the recent past and that this should be taxed.
It is ironic that while insisting that I ruined the economy, this Government says in the same breath that people had earned a lot of wealth during my tenure, which has to be taxed.
When ordinary people hear the phrase Capital Gains Tax they may assume that this is a tax levied only on rich people, who own capital, he said.
But what is meant by capital in this case is property owned by anybody.
If a farmer, labourer or schoolteacher disposes of his land or house, he will have to pay a tax on the difference between the price at which he bought it and the price at which he sold it. The Capital Gains Tax is no less objectionable than the VAT and NBT increase, he added. (Kelum Bandara)

Dharmaraja, Trinity, Carey slapped with bans
	
A special committee appointed by the Ministry of Education at a meeting held at the Ministry auditorium took the decision to slap bans on three rugby playing schools Dharmaraja, Trinity and Carey which they say has brought disrepute to the sport of rugby due to their behavior on and off the field.
Dharmaraja was slapped with a ban of nine months effective from July 1 for their misbehavior in the match against St Josephs played at the Bogambara Stadium two weeks ago which the Josephians was on the verge of winning the game.
The ban Trinity was for six months for an incident which took place in their second leg 72nd Bradby Shield encounter against Royal played at Pallekele while Carey too was imposed with a ban of six months due to their unruly behavior in the match against Siri Piyaratana MMV Padukka in a lower division match played in the latter part of May.
Apart from the nine month ban Dharmaraja will be on two years of interim suspension and a incident within this stipulated period would see them being dealt with much severe punishment.
The committee also further took stern action against Dharmaraja coach Radika Hettiarachchi, the physio therapist and assistant coach. Radika has been banned from coaching and will not be allowed to coach any school team until further notice while the physio has been banned for one year and the assistant coach has been banned for six months due to their involvement with the incident at the Bogambara Stadium while the master in charge of Dharmaraja has been given a stern warning.
Added to the nine month ban seven Dharmaraja players M.G. Bandara, C.D.B. Wijesnghe, E.M.O.P. Ekanayake, D.M.C. Gyashan, D.S.T.R. Ratnayake, K.S.B. Dissanayake and C.S.S. Abaragama have been banned from representing their school for a period of one year.
Beside the six month ban on Carey they too will be under interim suspension for two years and all the matches played by Carey will be deemed as null and void while Carey coach D. Nimal has been slapped with a six month ban.
The decisions were taken on the instruction of Viraj Kariyawasam the Minister of Education citing the aim is to instill discipline in the sports field which has been in down trend since the recent past..(M. Shamil Amit)

The Jathika Hela Urumaya (JHU) said today it was completely opposed to the 26th guideline out of the 36 gazetted by the Elections Commission to be followed by the electronic and print media saying that it was an attempt to separate politics from the cultural and religious background.
JHU National organizer Nishantha Sri Warnasinghe said his party accepted the guidelines to the media except for the 26th guideline which denotes that the use of national anthem, national flag, religious emblems, religious flags and other objects, persons with religious or national interest should not be used for promotion or demotion of candidates and advertisement comprising such objects or persons should not be telecast or broadcast.
He said they conveyed their objections regarding the 26th guideline to the Elections Commission and added that most of the past and present leaders had been working based on religious and cultural backgrounds and that the JHU was also based on religious and cultural backgrounds.
He said the Elections Commission should reconsider its decision with regard to the controversial guideline.
Mr. Warnasinghe said none of the political parties that were calling themselves to be nationalistic came forward against this decision and added that only the JHU as a political party opposed it.
Meanwhile, when asked Mr. Warnasinghe said the Committee on Public Enterprises (COPE) should release its report regarding the controversial Central Bank bond issue and that appointing a new Central Bank Governor alone was not enough to resolve the issue. (Ajith Siriwardana)

I never stab leaders in the back: SF
	
Democratic Party (DP) Leader Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka who joined the UNP today said he is not a person who stabs his leaders in the back.
Fonseka who was speaking at a ceremony held to mark his entry into the UNP said he had to confront his leader while in the army and he did it openly.  I had to confront my leader while in the army and I confronted him directly without stabbing him in the back, he said.
He said he became a strength to the UNP by agreeing to become the common candidate at the presidential elections in 2010.  I am close to the UNP as it is the party which brought me to politics. Everyone knows about the beginning of my political career, he said.
 It was I who said just after the presidential elections of 2015 that UNP should have a say in the administration of the country when others were silent, he said . He recalled that there were people such as Arjuna Ranatunga, Rajitha Senaratne at former President Chandrika Kumaratungas residence when he made this statement.
He said he had three personal ambitions including defeating the Rajapaksa regime and establishing good governance ( Yahapalanaya).
"I talked of Yahapalanaya on stage in 2010 before anyone else he said adding that he had achieved them today despite not having any significant personal achievements.
However he said he decided to join the UNP as it was the need of the hour as the ugly head of the previous regime still haunts the country. We defeated the Rajapaksas but they still haunt and we have to see that the country is freed from evil, he added. (Yohan Perera)

LPBOA agreeable to 6 percent hike; not in strike
	
Members of the LPBOA would not engage in the bus strike announced by the All Ceylon Private Bus Owners Association, LPBOA Chairman Gemunu Wijeratne said today.
The ACPBOA earlier announced that it would launch an islandwide bus strike commencing July 3 midnight
ACPBOA General Secretary Anjana Priyanjith and several other private bus association representatives are demanding a 15 percent bus fare increase.
If any person or association is trying to launch a strike after giving approval from the Cabinet Ministers, including President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, they should be considered as anti-government, Wijeratne said.
As an association we would not take such clueless decisions and we are not going to participate in such anti-government activities, he said.
The National Transport Commission still has the authority to give the percentage rate as 3.2. If the NTC does so, the bus service businesses will fail. The six percent bus fare revision was changed following a Cabinet decision and recommendations of the committee and it cannot be changed now, he said.
No one can change a decision after approved by the Cabinet. The people who are going to protest also signed the approval papers for the 3.2 percentage bus fare revision.
Somehow, if the islandwide bus strike was launched the Government can again come up with the previously approved 3.2 percentage, he said.
We must be thankful to Transport Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva for immediately altering the bus fare revision percentage to six, considering the relevant criteria, he said.
The six percent bus fare revision is more than enough for the transport industry based on the recent VAT increment, Wijeratne said.
Accordingly he said that the lowest point of a bus fare would be Rs. 9, which was previously Rs. 8.
Rs. 12 fares will be Rs. 13, 15 will go up to 16, he said. (Chaturanga Pradeep)

SLs key commitments remain unfulfilled: HRW
	
The Human Rights Watch (HRW) today said the Sri Lankan government has taken important steps to address the serious human rights problems but several of the governments key commitments to the Human Rights Council remain unfulfilled.
Issuing a statement, the HRW said the governments willingness to support the Councils October 2015 resolution was an important step. 
Among these positive actions is a draft bill to create an Office of Missing Persons (OMP) with strong powers to investigate the thousands of enforced disappearances from nearly three decades of armed conflict. The enacted law should ensure that the OMPs findings are automatically transferred to prosecutorial bodies, it said.
However, it said several of the governments key commitments remain unfulfilled as the government has yet to repeal, as pledged, the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA) and replace it with legislation meeting international human rights standards. All those still held under the PTA should be released if not appropriately charged, it said.
Since October, the government has at times backtracked on its commitment on the judicial mechanism for investigating war crimes and other serious rights abuses by both sides. The October 2015 resolution specifically calls for the participation of foreign judges, prosecutors, investigators, and defense lawyers, which is crucial to ensure that legal proceedings are protected from local pressures and have the independence that a purely domestic process would lack. However, President Sirisena has repeatedly stated, most recently on May 27, that the justice mechanism will not have foreign judges. This gap between the governments formal undertaking in the resolution and public statements by senior officials is an unnecessary distraction from making real progress on the pledged justice mechanism with international involvement. The foreign ministers statement here that our commitment to the Geneva resolution remains unchanged" and other government remarks that any justice mechanism would go forward only with the consent of victims groupswhich back foreign participationindicate the government intends to honor its pledges.
We urge the Council, consistent with the High Commissioners call for sustaining its close engagement, to work with Sri Lanka until all resolution commitments are fully met, the statement said.
