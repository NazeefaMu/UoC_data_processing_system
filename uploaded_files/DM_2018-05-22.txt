A duo indefinitely in Siberia
	

There are two former administrative heads of a certain main city council who held office during two consecutive periods now facing charges of misconduct and misappropriation of council funds. Relieved of their duties after charges being slapped on them, the duo has been assigned to Siberia in the council pending disciplinary inquiry.

Both daily attend the office, sign the same attendance register and make themselves scarce, they say.
The senior one of the two has been signing the attendance register for the last three years with no prospect of a disciplinary inquiry against him in sight as the file containing all vital documents related to charges against him has gone missing. The other one who succeeded him too was sent into Siberia following similar charges being preferred against him. There is a cobra  mongoose relationship between the two white collar ones now together in Siberia.

12.5% bus fare hike from midnight; Rs.12 for the first segment
	
The Cabinet has approved a 12.5% bus fare hike with the fare Rs.12 for the first segment of the journey with effect from midnight, Deputy Minister of Transport Ashoka Abeysinghe said.
He told the Daily Mirror that the approval was granted on the condition that there would be no bus fare increases for the next two years.
Inter-Provincial Private Bus Association (IPPBA) President Sarath Vijitha Kumara said the approved fare increment was more than enough than IPPBA demanded.
We had requested 15 percent fare increment, but 12.5 percent is more than enough. We are having a discussion this evening with the Deputy Transport Minister Ashoka Abesinghe and there we will show the actual price increment we requested, he said.
Lanka Private Bus Owners' Association (LPBOA) President Gemunu Wijeratne said the increment would lead to a total collapse of the private bus sector and the National Policy on Bus Fare Increment had totally collapsed.
This is only a short-term benefit. In the long-term we will lose, he said.
The condition on not increasing the bus fare for the next two years will increase the loss. Now we have to stay calm whatever happens to the private bus service. This is what the other private bus associations tried to get. Now we all finish, he said.
Meanwhile, All Ceylon Private Bus Owners' Federation (ACPBOF) Secretary Anjana Priyanjith said, that the Association would be meeting with the Transport Deputy Minister this evening and after the meeting, it would announce its decision. (Chaturanga Samarwickrama)

China uses educational facilities as an instrument of soft power
	
Sri Lankan monks explore possibilities of studying in China Photo Tang Lu

In 1990, Harvard Professor Joseph S. Nye, called such an approach to building up support as the use of soft power. The aim of soft power is to create, in another country, a favourable impression of the power in question, modifying the impact of military or economic might. 
Soft power involves the use of non-coercive means such as economic and technical aid, education, culture and communication.
Educational institutions are key instruments of soft power. Following the example of the Soviet Union and Russia, resurgent China, aiming to be respected in the world as a benign and responsible power in the face of Western skeptical propaganda, is using its gargantuan educational facilities to recruit, and perhaps influence, foreign students from across the world, especially those in its backyard and on the Belt and Road path girdling the earth. 
In 2014, Chinese President Xi Jinping gave a boost to this movement when he said: We should increase Chinas soft power, give a good Chinese narrative, and better communicate Chinas message to the world.

Chinese universities, being mostly State-owned, do not lay stress on making money and are eminently affordable

To familiarize foreigners with Chinese thought and culture, China opened the first Confucius Institute (CI) in 2004. And by January 2018, there were more than 500 CIs across the world, including one in Colombo University. The CI is a non-profit organization. It also provides Mandarin language courses, cooking and calligraphy classes. 

Mounting Foreign Student Population 
Chinese official statistics show that in 2017 students from 204 countries were studying in 935 Chinese higher education institutions located in 31 provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities. These included 75,800 graduate and doctoral students, an increase of 18.62% compared to 2016.
In 2017, 489,200 foreign students were studying in China, marking an increase of over 10% for the second consecutive year. The number of degree students reached 241,500 (49.38% of the total), up 15.04% year on year. A growing number of foreign students have been going for a Masters or PhD across a widening range of disciplines. 
By end 2017, China was the most popular destination for international students in Asia. Most students came from South Korea, Thailand, Pakistan, the US, India, Russia, Japan, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, and Laos, in that order. 
The number of students from Belt and Roadcountries accounted for 64.85% of all international students in China. In absolute numbers they were 317,200. This was an increase of 11.58% over the earlier year. 

By end 2017, China was the most popular destination for international students in Asia

The above statistics are significant because Chinas Belt and Road infrastructure projects in various parts of the world are creating jobs for students with knowledge of the Chinese language or students who have studied in China. Students are now enthused to study Chinese and in China because of this. 
Reasonable Cost 
The high fees charged by profit-making Western universities are a deterrent to students from developing countries. But Chinese universities, being mostly State-owned, do not lay stress on making money and are eminently affordable. 
The average tuition fees in public universities in China range from US$ 3,300 to US$ 10,000 per year. Fees for an English-medium degree course are from US$ 2,200 to US$ 4,500 per year. On an average, foreign students spend around US$ 4,000 for accommodation and about US$ 2,000 for other living needs per year. 
There are American and British universities with campuses in China. But these are costly. Tuition fees here start from US$ 8,000 and go to US$ 15,000 a year. A few like Beijing University charge US$ 17,000 a year. 
An MBBS students total expense (including living expenses) per year in China is US$ 7,500. But in the UK, it would be US$ 30,500 and in the United States, US$ 35,000. Even Indian private colleges charge more - US$ 14,700 a year. 
Role of Scholarships 
Scholarships offered by the Chinese government have allowed an increasing number of foreign students to pursue higher education in China.
In 2017, 58,600 foreign students from 180 countries were awarded Chinese government scholarships, accounting for 11.97% of the total. 88.02% of the recipients were degree students (51,600); 69.57% (40,800) were post-graduate or doctoral students, marking an increase of 20.06% compared to 2016. However the number of self-funded students was 430,600, accounting for 88.03% of all overseas students.
48.45% of foreign students were enrolled for liberal arts degrees. Those majoring in engineering, management, science, art and agronomy increased by 20% year on year. 
Liu Dong, Director of the Cultural Section in the Chinese Embassy in Colombo, said that the Chinese government offers Sri Lankans 80 scholarships in addition to many other full or partial scholarships offered by the Confucius Institute and Chinese provincial governments.
Hard Sell By Guangxi Province 
Recently, the Study in Guangxi Education Exhibition in Colombo, drew a steady stream of Sri Lankan students. 25 higher educational institutions from Guangxi Province offered a wide variety of courses in the liberal arts,

Recently, the Study in Guangxi Education Exhibition in Colombo, drew a steady stream of Sri Lankan students

management, technology, science, medicine, Chinese language, tourism and teaching. 
Qin Ping, Deputy Party Secretary of the Working Committee of Higher Education Institutions of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, said that over the past five years, the number of international students in Guangxi has grown at an annual rate of 20 percent. 
In 2017, more than 14,000 international students from 118 countries were studying in Guangxi, among which more than 12,000 students were from Asia. The number of Sri Lankan students going to Guangxi has gone up to 100 from 35 in 2012.
In a hard sell, the stalls at the Guangxi exhibition were staffed by smiling and communicative Chinese youth, eager to answer questions put by the students. The well-lit displays showed beautiful campuses set in verdant surroundings.
Besides beating the drum about the high quality of education the institutions offer and that at an affordable price, the brochures made it a point to say that the campuses provide foreign students with good living conditions, thus addressing a major concern of students from developing countries who are unfamiliar with China.
Meets a Felt Need 
The response from Sri Lankan students was good because there is a tremendous shortage of institutions of higher learning in the island. As the Additional Secretary of the Higher Education Minister Madhawa Devasurendra said, Sri Lankan students who qualify for university admission far outnumber available seats. 

In 2017, more than 14,000 international students from 118 countries were studying in Guangxi

Those who fail to make it to the university either opt out of higher learning or go for expensive degrees and diplomas offered by teaching shops which prepare students for exams conducted by Western Universities and colleges of varying quality and credibility. 
Has Chinas Bid Been Effective
Natalie Hongs 2014 study of EU-China education diplomacy found that 50% returned from China with a positive impression, while around 40 % returned with an unchanged impression. 
The score would improve if the Chinese mix with the foreigners more, giving up their insularity and prejudices and also learn to speak English.
David Shambaugh, writing in Foreign Affairs in 2015 said that Chinas tightening authoritarian political system was the biggest obstacle to the positive image the country. 
So long as Chinas political system does not enable free human development, its propaganda efforts will face an uphill battle, Shambaugh wrote.

Conservation of Biodiversity for Sustainable Development in Sri Lanka
	

What is Biodiversity
Biodiversity is the shortened form of two words biological and diversity. In short, bio means life, and diversity means a range of different things  and simply biodiversity means A Diversity of Life. It is a combination of all lives that are found on Earth (plants, animals, fungi and micro-organisms) and the communities they form and the habitats in which they live. The biodiversity we experience today is the result of billions of years evolution shaped by natural processes, and the influence of human beings and their web of life. Basically, biodiversity provides a large number of goods and services that sustain all lives on earth, since biological resources are the pillars in which civilizations are built upon. According to the Convention on Biological Diversity, the formal definition of biodiversity is: the variability among living organisms from all sources including, inter-alia, terrestrial, marine and other aquatic ecosystems and the ecological complexes of which they are a part; this includes diversity within species, between species and of ecosystems. 
The value of biodiversity
Biodiversity is the foundation for sustainable development. Throughout history healthy ecosystems have been resilient to adapt to gradual environmental change; but the varied natural services are impossible to replace, because ecosystems continuously provide essential services by securing earths variety of life and contribute to human well-being. The loss of biodiversity threatens food supplies, sources of wood, medicines, energy, and opportunities for recreation, tourism, and other essential ecological functions. Biodiversity plays a major role in agriculture, forestry, wildlife and also urban development. Therefore, conservation of biodiversity is necessary to challenge population and economic growths that causes habitat fragmentation, habitat loss, introduction of invasive species, environmental pollution, soil erosion, over-exploitation of resources over-harvesting, and nutrient loss in soils. There is no clear blueprint for effective protection that could be implemented immediately for protection of biodiversity, but people should understand that a focus on economic arguments will not help to save the natural resources or ecosystems. The transition to sustainability is not easy, but it is central to securing a future for biodiversity. 
Challenges for Biodiversity Conservation
Tropical forests disappear every minute. Many species of animals and plants are at risk of extinction at alarming rates mainly because of the destruction of natural environments. These losses, and increasing numbers of endangered animals have generated a major concern for the conservation of ecosystems. The current decline in biodiversity is largely due to the results of certain human activities. It is a serious threat to human development, therefore, taking effective, urgent and decisive action to halt the loss of biodiversity, and protect biodiversity have to be in our self-interest. To ensure this, pressures on biodiversity have to be reduced, ecosystems have to be restored, biological resources have to be sustainably used, adequate financial benefits should be provided, capacities should be enhanced, and proper policies have to be implemented effectively. Problems related to biodiversity and ecosystem services include diverse values, complexity, uncertainty and the involvement of many sectors. Without an integrated cross-sectoral and multi-level policy approach, action needed to address biodiversity issues will be hindered. Therefore, to effectively promote ecosystem conservation, an integrated management of natural resources is needed through the cooperation of many different actors. 
History of the International Day for Biological Diversity
In 1993, the 29th of December was selected as the International Day for Biological Diversity to educate the world and increase understanding and awareness on the importance of Biodiversity and its related issues. As holidays coincide with this time of the year, this date was changed by the UN General Assembly, and the International Day for Biodiversity (IDB) was changed to the 22nd of May in 2000. Biological diversity is a global asset of tremendous value to the present and future generations. Therefore, each year a theme is selected to educate the world on different topics under the field of biodiversity from water, marine, forest and sustainable development concerns. 
Theme for International Day for Biological Diversity in 2018
The International Day for Biodiversity theme for 2018 is Celebrating 25 Years of Action for Biodiversity. The theme has been selected to mark the 25th anniversary of the entry into force of the Convention on Biological Diversity and to highlight progress made in the achievement of its objectives at the national and global levels. 
Protecting biodiversity in Sri Lanka to serve humanity
Sri Lanka which is ranked as a global biodiversity hot spot exhibits a wide array of ecosystems with an exceptional degree of endemism and a diversity of species considered to be the richest per unit area in the Asian region. It has several distinct climatic zones comprising of forests with different characteristics, rich marine and coastline ecosystems, wildlife, and wetlands associated with 103 major rivers and over 10,000 irrigation tanks. The Government of Sri Lanka has enacted various policies and laws aimed at protecting natural resources with an understanding of its importance for sustained growth and poverty reduction. Explicitly, Sri Lanka was the first country in Asia to prepare a National Environmental Action Plan in 1992. Then, the National Forestry Policy in 1995; National Air Quality Management Policy in 2000; National Environment Policy in 2003; National Watershed Management Policy in 2004; National Policy on Wetlands in 2005; National Policy on Elephant Conservation in 2006; and the National Policy on Solid Waste Management. Simultaneously a number of natural resources management strategies were developed, such as the Strategy for the Conservation and Sustainable Use of Biological Diversity of 1994; Biodiversity Conservation Action Plan of 1998, and addendum of 2006; Protected Area Gap Analysis of 2006; Haritha Lanka of 2009; and Drivers of Deforestation and Forest Degradation of Sri Lanka of 2015; and the National Environmental Conservation Programme in 2015. 
Despite conservation efforts and legal protection; deforestation, forest degradation and biodiversity loss continue. The Human-Elephant Conflict is a noteworthy issue in the context of Sri Lanka s development because one third of the wild elephant population are found outside the protected areas as these protected areas are insufficient in size and quality to sustain the countrys elephant population. With the accelerating development activities in the country leading to fragmentation of habitats, innovative landscape management approaches are needed to address the Human-Elephant Conflict.

Sri Lanka which is ranked as a global biodiversity hot spot exhibits a wide array of ecosystems with an exceptional degree of endemism and a diversity of species

The development framework of the Government of Sri Lanka has committed to a path of sustainable development and has identified the countrys biodiversity as part of its natural heritage and a high conservation priority. The Ecosystem Conservation and Management Project (ESCAMP) supports the Country Partnership Strategys strategic themes on improved living standards and social inclusion, and improved resilience to climate and disaster risks. Encouraging efforts to protect ecosystems and the species they contain is a major concern of ESCAMP. To accomplish this goal, the project implementing agencies  the Forest Department and the Department of Wildlife Conservation are guiding the conservation process of the protected areas. They are also working to increase public awareness on the factors that contribute to loss of biodiversity by developing programmes where individuals and communities can discover ways to reduce their impacts on the environment. 
Through its project components, ESCAMP directly responds to Sri Lankas development priorities through improvement of natural resources management, and protecting and improving the natural resource base on which rural communities depend. It contributes to key national strategies and action plans; conservation of wildlife resources; improve habitat in protected areas by restoration of water bodies, protection of water resources, removal of invasive species,increasing forest cover, and Assisting Natural Regeneration (ANR) to encourage natural establishment of forest cover;developing mechanisms for human-elephant co-existence; institutional strengthening; and improving the revenue generating capability of wildlife and forest resources by providing economical values such as eco-tourism and other employment opportunities. The project also contributes to the higher level objective of long-term environmental sustainability and inclusiveness of growth and development in and around ecologically sensitive areas in Sri Lanka. ESCAMP contributes in the protection and conservation of biodiversity in Sri Lanka and safeguard vulnerable ecosystems; because Sri Lankas biodiversity and natural resources endowments are important assets for future sustainable development. 
ESCAMP wishes every Sri Lankan celebrates the diversity of our natural world not just on International Day for Biological Diversity but throughout the year!

Finance Ministry Ad on Crude Oil: JO to refer matter to COPA
	
The joint opposition said today it was hoping to request the Committee on Public Accounts (COPA) to summon the Finance Ministry Secretary in connection with the recent newspaper advertisement comparing crude oil prices during the previous government and today.
JO MP and COPA member Bandula Gunawardena said the contents of the advertisement published by the Finance Ministry using public funds was false.
During the previous government, the price of a barrel of crude oil always remained at more than US$100. Even recent Central Bank reports confirm these prices. However, the Finance Ministry advertisement says the price of a barrel of crude oil during the previous government was US$60. It is a blatant lie. It is tax payers money which had been misused to publish these fabricated data. As a COPA member I expect to request the Committee to summon Finance Ministry secretary on this matter, he told a news briefing. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Gota plans to put country on a  destructive path
	

Gotabaya Rajapaksa

Its crystal clear that Rajapaksa siblings have been endeavouring to grab ruling power once again
	OnlyUS$ 863 millionhave to be paid for the debts that were borrowed after 2015
	US$ 4,285 million have to be paid in 2019 out of which UD$ 3,315 or 77% of the repayment are for the debt obtained during the tenure of the Rajapaksa regime
	The salary of all public servants will be increased by 107% in 2020 to that of their salaries in 2014

Former President and Kurunegala District MP Mahinda Rajapaksa who is responsible for ruining this country by allowing his family relatives and cronies to plunder the countrys economy and allowed former Defense secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa to unleash terror through the white van culture that isolated the country internationally, now seems to be engaged in an untiring effort to throw the country again into Vipath Maga, the destructive path. 
Gotabaya Rajapaksa who invented white van culture in Sri Lanka, that attracted world attention, has said recently that the rulers and the public officials should be free of corruption. Gotabaya, who could be considered as the most corrupted and dangerous public officer ever appointed in this country, is now talking like a child after rebirth. Several Cases are being heard in Courts and investigations are carried out by the Police against him at the moment: The corrupt MIG deal, plundering public money to construct memorial museums and name them after his parents, unleashing assaults on journalists and enforced disappearances, instigating corruption and terror and maintaining an illegal armory thereby depriving the Government of its due income, are some of them. 
Instead of proving his innocence before Courts against such charges levelled against him, he has retained leading lawyers to obtain anticipatory bail orders. It is not only these charges that are against him charges of the kind are also being investigated against the other members of the Rajapaksa family. Its crystal clear that Rajapaksa siblings have been endeavouring to grab ruling power once again by misleading the public because they are impatient to shove these legal cases against them under the carpet and exploit the national resources once again, with no love for the country. 
Not only that, they have been envious of this Government as we were able to strengthen the local economy despite many challenges after 2015. They have also been fabricating statistics and distorting the truth in an attempt to mislead the public. 
Even in the face of such challenges, the Government has been able to strengthen the economy of the country and proven that its administration is better than in the past. When there was an economic development programme, supported by the private investment in the 1990s, the export earnings were 30% of the Gross Domestic Product. But they never say that our Government was compelled to take over an economy with a dwindling export income of 12% in 2014. Not only that, they do not say that our Government took over a debt-ridden economy! 
Kurunegala District MP, Mahinda Rajapaksa has charged that the Unity Government has to make the highest recorded debt repayment of US$ 4.2 billion in 2019 in the history due to the debt crisis created by the Yahapalana regime. The following fact file would help Mahinda Rajapaksa restore his lost memory. 
After Independence in 1948, 2018 marks the year where the highest amount of foreign debt has to be paid. The total foreign debt to be paid this year is US$ 2,845 million out of which US$ 1,789 million has to be paid for foreign debts; which were borrowed before the year 2015. An installment worth US$ 1,056 million will be paid for the foreign loans borrowed after 2015. Accordingly, 63% of debt installments to be paid this year are repayments of debts that had been borrowed during Mahinda Rajapaksas tenure as finance minister. It was at the level of 75% in 2017. 
This crisis would further worsen next year. US$ 4,285 million have to be paid in 2019 out of which UD$ 3,315 or 77% of the repayment are for the debt obtained during the tenure of the Rajapaksa regime. 
Another US$3,768 million will have to be paid as loan installments and the interest in 2020 out of which 77% or US$2,905 million amount to the debts that were borrowed before 2015. Only US$ 863 million have to be paid for the debts that were borrowed after 2015. In 2021, 83% of the foreign debt installments will have to be paid to repay the debt taken before 2015. In addition, even in 2030, 73% of the repayments will go to pay the debt that were obtained during the Rajapaksa regime for the waste, fraud and corruption committed by the oligarchies of the Rajapaksas. 
Loans obtained for election work
The loan installment to be paid in 2019 includes a US$1,000 million which was obtained on January 6th, 2014 at 6% interest to be paid within five years and, a US$ 500 million obtained on April 7th, 2014 at an interest rate of 5.1% to be paid within five years. These two loans, amounting to US$1,500 million and obtained at commercial rates, will matured in 2019 and the entire loan has to be repaid in bulk with full interest. The Mahinda Rajapaksa regime obtained these loans in a hurry in 2014, not for the development work, but for the election where they lured unsuspected voters thereby distributing items such as Sil Redi. 
After this Government was voted into power, it has obtained foreign debts worth US$ 12 billion during the last three years and, 6 billion out of which was from International donor Agencies and under bilateral agreements at concessionary interest rates. They have been spent on various projects. These loans were taken neither under commercial basis nor for consumer purposes as Mahinda Rajapaksa attempts to interpret. 
12. 48% out of the total foreign debt obtained after 2015 have been used to repay the debts that were borrowed during the Rajapaksa regime. Although this Government was destined to shoulder such a heavy debt burden in 2015, it has been able to take steps to implement development activities at a fast pace than that of the Rajapaksa regime thereby assuring more direct benefits to the people. 
The allocations made by this Government for education, health and housing are the best proof to such claims. 
(Allocations in Rupees billions) 
Although 1.8% of the GDP was spent on education in 2014, it was gradually increased up to 1.9% in 2017. It will further be increased up to 6% within the next few years. The allocation for health will be increased up to 3.5% of GDP within the next few years. The allocations for public welfare have been increased to 265 billion rupees in 2017 from 165 billion rupees in 2014. Its an increase from 1.6% to 2% of GDP. 
Salary increments 
Soon after this Government assumed power, it gave a pledge to increase the salaries of the public servants by Rs 10,000 rupees because their salary hadnt been increased by even a single cent since 2006. This Rs.10, 000.00 increment has been transformed according to a 1:4 scale. Thereby the salary of all public servants will be increased by 107% in 2020 to that of their salaries in 2014. 
Comparing to the prices of powdered milk, domestic gas and fuel in 2014, they are still at a lower level and, when public servants salary is increased by 107% in 2020, I reiterate that it will help people to increase their income and maintain the cost of living at a low level. Although prices of diesel, petrol and kerosene were increased recently, people do not forget that even the current prices of such items are lower than that of the prices that prevailed during the Rajapaksa regime. 
The economy, during the previous Government which was handled by their cronies and henchmen, didnt have any proper system in place to implement economic development in a manner that would bring direct benefits to the people. The Rajapaksa siblings, who ruled this country under such a background, have been attempting to regain power by throwing the people into Vipath Maga the destructive path. Therefore we urge the people to defeat such attempts and rally round the Governments agenda to build a strong economy and a rich country by the year 2025.

High cost doesnt matter to him
	

This person who took over a Ministry newly constituted combining two separate portfolios, has planned to shift all his Ministry offices to a building with a lesser floor space but for a much higher monthly rental.

The purohitas new Ministry is currently housed in a spacious building where his additional offices could be easily accommodated. The monthly rental for this building is Rs. 4.4 million. However, the Ministry will be required to pay a whopping monthly rental of Rs.11.7 million if it is to be shifted to the proposed building which has lesser space than the one where the Ministry is already located. The proposed new building is reportedly owned by another politico who is running a business in a section of the building.
The Ministry employees have already complained to Number One about the move on the part of the purohita to relocate the Ministry offices to the proposed building despite the glaring disadvantage in regard to floor space and rental payment.

Johann Peries becomes second Sri Lankan to summit Mount Everest
	
Johann Peries has successfully reached the summit of Mount Everest, becoming only the second Sri Lankan in history to have reached the top of the worlds tallest mountain. Johann Peries successfully summited Mt. Everest at 5.55 am Nepal time on the morning of 22 May. Peries earlier attempt in 2016 was unsuccessful when his oxygen tank failed 400 metres before the summit.
Speaking after he made the difficult descent from Mt. Everest, Johann says that he was proud to unfurl the Sri Lankan flag at the worlds highest mountain peak, and dedicated his successful Everest Expedition to all Sri Lankans.
This was Johanns second attempt at scaling the Everest peak. His first attempt was in April 2016 when he and Jayanthi Kuru-Utumpala were the first Sri Lankans to attempt to summit the peak, but Johann was forced to turn back at 8,400m, a mere 448m short of reaching the summit, due to technical difficulties with his equipment. Kuru-Utumpala went on to complete the climb, becoming the first Sri Lankan to scale Mt. Everest.
Johann says he was determined to achieve his goal this time around.
The first time I came to Everest it was a dream, Johann says. This time, it was even bigger than a dream, so I knew it must happen. This time I knew what to expect  I was better physical shape, and I was mentally ready to take up this challenge.
Johann has been supported in his Everest bid by the support and encouragement of thousands of his fellow Sri Lankans. Many of them also joined in the efforts to sponsor the costs of the expedition, which amounted to nearly USD 60,000. The Climb Everest with Johann campaign, carried out online, allowed well-wishers to sponsor each of the more than 80,000 steps Johann would take on Mount Everest to reach the peak.
Johann says that fund raising the second time around was even more difficult than it was the first time.
Johann is expected back in Sri Lanka on 6th of June, and - after just one day of rest- has planned to dive right back into his regular, hectic schedule with a bride to dress and style on his first day back at work.
Johann hopes to share his story of overcoming daunting challenges and never giving up on dreams with as many Sri Lankans as possible.
I want nothing more than to inspire other Sri Lankans to aim for the highest peaks in whatever field they choose, Johann says. I want to encourage everyone I meet to keep pushing forward until they too achieve their dreams. Because I know we can!

Mahanama, Dissanayake re-remanded till June 5
	
President Maithripala Sirisena's former chief of staff I.H.K. Mahanama and State Timber Corporation (STC) former chairman P. Dissanayaka, in remand custody on charges of accepting a Rs.20 million bribe, were today re-remanded till June 5 by Court today.
When the case was taken up for inquiry by Colombo Chief Magistrate Ranga Dassanayake, the Bribery Commission (BC) requested the Magistrate to direct prison authorities to submit the suspects for a voice test at the CID Digital Forensic Unit. The defence counsel objected to this request with the Magistrate saying he will give his ruling on the next hearing date.
The investigation was launched on the complaint that I.H.K. Mahanama solicited a bribe of Rs.540 million from an Indian investor. This amount was later reduced to Rs.100 million and the two suspects were arrested by officers of the BC while accepting a bribe of Rs.20 million. (Yoshitha Perera)

Mahendran played key role in signing FTA: Dayasiri
	
SLFP MP Dayasiri Jayasekara alleged today that former Central Bank Governor Arjuna Mahendran, who was in Singapore, had played the key role in signing the Free Trade Agreement between Sri Lanka and Singapore.
"Mr. Mahendran has been assigned the duties to function as the Sri Lankan representative in Singapore in matters regarding the SL-Singapore FTA while he was wanted by the courts over the Central Bank Bond scam," he said.
He told parliament that even though the Singapore-Sri Lanka FTA was approved by the Cabinet, it was not discussed at length as the subject minister Malik Samarawickrama wanted it approved in a hurry.
He said the Cabinet approval was granted to it on condition that the Attorney General's recommendations should be included in it, adverse effects on local industries and services should be addressed and to give an opportunity to the Cabinet to discuss the adverse effect of the FTA and asked if the conditions had been followed.
He said no action had been taken to ensure the security of the local professionals, technicians and skilled and unskilled labour in the agreement.
Mr. Jayasekara said even though the minister claimed that the shortcomings could be discussed, there was no room in the agreement for any amendments as it was indefinite.
"There is not even an exit clause in the agreement. We have to go to Singapore for arbitration," he said.
He said Sri Lanka did not have a national policy on Free Trade Agreements and requested the minister to appoint a committee to implement a national policy on Free Trade Agreements and to review the impacts of the prevailing agreements. (Ajith Siriwardana and Yohan Perera)

May 22-The forgotten Republic Day From Dominion Ceylon to Sovereign Sri Lanka
	
Until the war victory on 18th May 2009, which overshadowed it, every year on May 22 we commemorated Republic Day
	The republican idea was mooted in 1970 by the leaders of the LSSP during the drawing up of a Common manifesto of the United Front for General Election,

Today is the forgotten Republic Day. Sri Lanka became a Republic on 22nd May 1972, with the adoption of a new Constitution. Until the war victory on 18th May 2009, which overshadowed it, every year on May 22 All Ministries, Government Departments, Statutory Corporations and other State institutions commemorated Republic Day. Heads of the department with the participation of staff hoisted the national flag and delivered a short speech on the importance of this Day. I remember the then Ministry of Constitutional Affairs and National Integration distributed brochures titled the Birth of a Republic among school students explaining its significance; that the country achieved real independence from imperialists. The independence, the country achieved on 4th February, 1948 became meaningful through the Republic Constitution in 1972. Dr. Colvin R. De Silva played a prominent role in the compilation of this Constitution as the Minister of Constitutional Affairs in addition to his Plantations portfolio.
However, long before this happened in 1956 former Prime Minister S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike set up a Parliamentary Select Committee to draft a new Constitution for the same purpose, but it did not materialize. The republican idea was mooted in 1970 by the leaders of the LSSP during the drawing up of a Common manifesto of the United Front for General Election, which said, we seek a mandate to permit the members of Parliament you elect to function simultaneously as a constituent assembly to draft, adopt and operate a new constitutionwhich would declare Ceylon to be a free, sovereign and independent Republic pledged to realize the objectives of Socialist Democracy. It was placed before the people for a mandate at May 27, 1970 elections. The 1972 Constitution secured fundamental rights and freedoms to all citizens, a feature lacked in the Soulbury Constitution.
The Coalition Government of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party, the Samasamajists and the Communists, led by Sirimavo Bandaranaike set up a Constituent Assembly on July 21, 1970, to draft a new Republican constitution which was adopted by the Constituent Assembly on the 22nd of May, 1972. The Soulbury Constitution, drafted by Sir Ivor Jennings, which the British Colonial government had imposed on us in 1947 before conceding independence, ceased to have effect from this date. May 22, 1972 became a historic day for Sri Lanka when the final link of the chain that bound us to the British imperialists was severed and the totally independent Republic of Sri Lanka was born. The Republican Constitution was a significant achievement ending the two and a half millennia of monarchical rule as per recorded history of the island nation. The position of Governor General was abolished and a ceremonial post of President was established. The new constitution marked the change in status of our land and its people. It has a foundation or root which is entirely different from the authority of British Crown over Ceylon.

The new constitution marked the change in status of our land and its people. It has a foundation or root which is entirely different from the authority of British Crown over Ceylon.

It is this Constitution that enabled us to remove the economic bonds that bound us to Britain and to expand our relations with the other nations. We were able to serve our own interests. We freed our nation from British economic and political authority. The British crown was no longer the crest of our Government. Britons lost direct control of the tea plantations through which the Sterling companies drew profits away to Britain. Tea auctions located in Britain were relocated in Colombo.
Dr. Colvin R de Silva, the leading criminal lawyer, historian and a leader of Marxist movement in the island, who once commented, thats because God never trusted them in the dark in response to famous saying that identified the British Empire as, The Empire that sun never sets, was appointed as the head of the drafting committee. He ensured maximum power to the Legislature through the elected representatives of the people, which powers the 1978 Constitution of Jayewardene brothers [JR and HW] took away and place it in the hands of a single individual, the Executive President, resulting in many problems of authority that confront us. 
Removing Section 29 of the Soulbury Constitution
Two charges were levelled against the architect of the draft proposals, Dr. Colvin, by sections of minority, that by deleting Section 29 of the Soulbury Constitution, the protection that existed to the minorities hasbeen removed. 
Section 29 (2) says, No law shall -prohibit or restrict the free exercise of any religion; or make persons of any community or religion liable to disabilities or restrictions to which persons of other communities or religions are not made liable; or confer on persons of any community or religion any privilege or advantage which is not conferred on persons of other communities or religions, or alter the constitution of any religious body except with the consent of the governing authority of that body, so, however, that in any case where a religious body is incorporated by law, no such alteration shall be made except at the request of the governing authority of that body.
The 1972 Constitution being entirely new; the question of preserving a section of the old constitution does not arise. The introduction of a completely new chapter on Fundamental Rights, was something the Soulbury Constitution did not carry. Dr Colvin argued, through a chapter on Fundamental Rights, we did what was done or supposed or believed to have been made by Section 29 of the Soulbury Constitution, together with things that were not done there.
The Indian Tamil voters were disenfranchised by the D.S. Senanayake government by passing the Citizenship Bill of 1948:Section 29 of the Soulbury Constitution did not prevent the passing of the relevant bill: again, same with the Official Language Act of Bandaranaike in 1956; which made Sinhala only the official language. The 1972 constitution introduced a section compelling the Courts to scrutinize the bills before they were passed instead of after it is passed. The above two legislations would not have received the sanction of Courts if the 1972 Provisions were there.
Chapter VI -1972 Constitution- Fundamental Rights and Freedoms
18. (1) all persons are equal before the law and are entitled to equal protection of the law; no person shall be deprived of life, liberty or security of person except in accordance with the law; no citizen shall be arrested, held in custody, imprisoned or detained except in accordance with the law; every citizen shall have the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion. This right shall include the freedom to have or to adopt a religion or belief of his choice, and the freedom, either individually or in community with others and in public or private, to manifest his religion or belief in worship, observance, practice and teaching; every citizen has the right by himself or in association with others, to enjoy and promote his own culture; all citizens have the right to freedom of peaceful assembly and of association; every citizen shall have the right to freedom of speech and expression, including publication; no citizen otherwise qualified for appointment in the central government, local government, public corporation services and the like, shall be discriminated against in respect of any such appointment on the ground of race, religion, caste or sex
Foremost Place for Buddhism
The Kandyan Chiefs and the Mahanayake Theras agreed to the Kandyan Convention as Governor Brownrigg cunningly included an article,[the fifth clause] -
The religion of Buddha, professed by the chiefs and inhabitants of these provinces is declared inviolable and its rites and ministers and places of worship are to be maintained and protected.
The 1948 Constitution of Independent Sri Lanka didnt give Buddhism the foremost place as of now. D.S. Senanayake was under pressure to include a special clause for Buddhism by the two prelates of Asgiriya and Malwatta who in protest threatened to boycott the Independence inauguration ceremony. At a conference with the Mahanayakes of the two chapters, Prime Minister D.S. did not give in but convinced the two Prelates on the importance of not introducing special provisions on protection or foremost place to Buddhism saying, If equality is a basic tenet of Dhamma, then you cant give primacy to one religion. In 1972, PM Sirimavo being mindful of Article 5 of the 1815 Kandyan Convention, she had directed Dr. Colvin to provide the foremost place to Buddhism. The Trotskyite could not escape inclination towards religion though he regretted it later. It was his republican constitution, which provided Buddhism a special place. From then onwards the bhikkhus became lasting players in Sri Lankan politics. From 1972, was there any special protection or progress to Buddhism by the Government; and what damage it did to Buddhism from 1948 to 1972, during which stage there was no such constitutional assurance
Colvin had quipped
she is thrusting the Kandyan Throne into our Constitution. 
Sirimavos government which initiated the conversion to a Republican Constitution; and Dr. Colvin, who was responsible for the draft as Minister of Constitutional Affairs in that government signified the completion of our political sovereignty. The leftists had always believed that the countrys dominion status could be transformed into real independence only with the separation of its constitutional attachment with Britain and the vesting of political autonomy in the people. 
Whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends [life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness] it is the right of the people to alter or abolish it, and to institute new government.
--Thomas Jefferson

Microbeads causing macro levels of harm to humans and nature
	
Sale And Use of Plastic
TIME TO EMBRACE CULTURE OF RESPONSIBLE RECYCLING
When the Meethotamulla garbage dump collapsed in April last year, President Maithripala Sirisena immediately banned the sale of plastic bags, cups, plates and burning of refuse containing plastic. 
A similar ban was imposed from January with regard to the use and production of polythene less than 20 microns. The ban was imposed without a proper plan to introduce an alternative product. According to observations made by the Environmental Foundation Limited (EFL), Sri Lanka generates 700 metric tonnes of solid waste per day with the Western Province accounting for nearly 60% of waste generation. Adding to this menace is the uncoordinated collection of garbage where in most instances they are collected, but not segregated. Although many moves were made to reduce the use of plastics and its harmful effects on the environment, Sri Lankans continue using plastic bags, making the ban on plastics look ridiculous. Making things worse, Sri Lanka was listed fifth among the worlds biggest marine polluters. In a recent video published by our sister video channel W NOW, the harmful causes of microbeads were highlighted. Microbeads are manufactured solid plastic particles of less than one millimetre in dimension. They are frequently made of polyethylene, but can be turned out of other petrochemical plastics such as polypropylene and polystyrene. Hence the Daily mirror sheds light on the adverse effects of microbeads, a PET bottle manufacturers point of view and the present status of solid waste management in Sri Lanka.

Micro beads are a threat to marine environments
The formation of plastic is a chemical process. There are plasticizers which are added to bring about features such as hardiness, strength etc in order to promote plasticity and flexibility and reduce the brittleness-Dr.Waruna Gunathilake
According to Dr.Waruna Gunathilake,former Head of the Department of NationalPoisons Information and Toxicology and ExpertAdviser on Essential Drugs and Antidotesattached to WHOs South- East Asia RegionalOffice (SEARO) microbeads itself is a type ofpolythene and they contain several chemicals. Microbeads have micron particles and areused in cosmetics
Their primary purpose is exfoliation or rather a rinsing effect and that is why they are used in cosmetics such as facial scrubs, lotions and creams. In addition to that micro beads could also be found in over-the-counter products such as toothpaste. Microbeads are a threat to marine environments because aquatic species ingest on these micro particles which leads to the extinction of these species. They also carry various health risks with regard to humans as well. Although various alternatives have been suggested in place of plastics, people still tend to use plastic bags when they shop and for other purposes. If plastic users and providers are taxed then its use may be minimized. Other alternatives such as brown paper bags and paper bags could be used. 

Speaking further Dr. Gunathilake added that all plastics arent the same. They have different chemical structures and other external materials. The formation of plastic is a chemical process. There are plasticizers which are added to bring about features such as hardiness, strength etc in order to promote plasticity and flexibility and reduce the brittleness. These materials are often toxic and would have a dangerous effect on the environment. Therefore its important that the law will be enforced by the authorities. It should in turn bring about a change in behaviour and attitude. The Government also needs to introduce alternatives in place of the use of plastics and make these alternatives available to the people,said Gunathilake. 



Responsible recycling will reduce harmful effects of plastics
Speaking to theDaily MirrorSnackings Pvt. Ltd Managing Director Muttiah Prabagaran said that when considering the manufacture of plastic and glass bottles, glass bottles require more energy. Plastic manufacturing doesnt require that much energy. In terms of raw materials, glass needs more silica and that requires mining sand. In turn that contributes to an environmental hazard as well. When it comes to the beverage industry, plastic bottles need not be washed before adding the beverages. But this is not the case with glass bottles. They need to be washed thoroughly. In fact one litre would require three to four litres of water for washing. Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) bottles need not be washed now, thanks to the technological advancements. Glass bottles need a chemical wash which also leads up to chemical contamination,Prabagaran explained.
One of the key issues identified by Prabagaran is the lack of responsible recycling. We dont see garbage being segregated today and that is one of the main reasons why this problem associated with plastic has become an environmental issue. Even Singapore uses more plastics than we, but they have effective garbage collection strategies. From bin setups to collection, segregation and recycling should take place accordingly in order to reduce the risks of pollution. If glass bottles are recycled, then it has to be a coloured bottle and this also requires a lot of energy.
People misunderstand the underlying issues as they are not highlighted and therefore keepattacking the plastic industry. Everything around us is made of plastic and having glass around us is impractical in the first place, he added.



There are several small manufacturers who are involved in the milk industry who make a few products, he continued. For example, those involved in the yoghurt industry would make a few cups because the Government is not supporting them to use reusable cups. Therefore the cottage industry may not be able to survive, given the situation.

Plastic manufacturing doesnt require that much energy. In terms of raw materials, glass needs more silica and that requires mining sand. In turn that contributes to an environmental hazard as well
-Muttiah Prabagaran


Everybody says plastic is bad, but there is no system to collect and segregate garbage properly. Instead of banning plastic the Government could get together with companies and societies and launch an area-wise programme where people can be educated to use plastic responsibly.
We are not finding solutions and the environmental authorities have to be involved in this process. At the moment we are considering a project thatll help recycle PET bottles. There has to be a channel like the Municipal Council, but the authorities are not equipped with sufficient data. They dont have statistics and this handicaps our objectives. There is a plant which now recycles PET bottles to make fibre filaments. However, if plastic is recycled responsibly there would be no harm to the environment, he concluded. 

Present status of solid waste management in Sri Lanka
A Gazette (Extraordinary) Notification bearing number 2015/53 dated 20th of April 2017, states that all services, related to waste disposal, including clearance, collection, treatment and separation are to be considered as essential services under section 17 of the Public Security Ordinance.

People misunderstand the underlying issues as they are not highlighted and therefore keep attacking the plastic industry. Everything around us is made of plastic and having glass around us is impractical in the first place
-Muttiah Prabagaran


It focuses on steps that are being taken when disposing, collecting, transporting, storing, preparing, segregating garbage and disposing garbage collected from households as well as that which is collected from the road and related services. According to the Ordinance, anyone who is guilty of such offences mentioned orif there is reason to believe that someone was responsible for such a crime, they could be arrested by a police officer, any moment, even without an arrest warrant. Anyone thus arrested could be sentenced by a Magistrate following a trial. Offenders could be fined Rs. 10,000 and jailed for a period of two years.


The Government also needs to introduce alternatives in place of the use of plastics
	Even Singapore uses more plastics thanSri Lanka
	Everybody says plastic is bad, but there is no system to collect and segregate garbage properly


Waste collection and disposal responsibilities are vested with the local authorities of the particular Divisional Secretariat, either a municipal council (as per the Municipal Councils Ordinance -1947), urban council (Urban Councils Ordinance  1939) or local council (PradeshiyaSabha Act  1987). Provisions related to waste management and disposal, are made under the National Environmental Act No.47 of 1981 and Public Nuisance Ordinance. 
At the onset of the Meethotamulla garbage dump collapse, several other sites were identified as possible garbage dumping spots; one being the Muthurajawela Bird Sanctuary. It was then suggested that garbage will be transported to Aruwakkalu in the Puttalam District as a long-term plan. During the 2018 Budget announcement, Rs. 3 billion was allocated to accelerate the Aruwakkalu Waste Management Programme which includes the construction of a sanitary landfill site. The project will see the transfer of solid waste by train in sealed containers from the yet-to-be-established transfer station in Kelaniya to the proposed site in Aruwakkalu.

Mullivaikkal Remembrance Day: NUTA unhappy about Jaffna undergrads involvement
	
The National University Teachers' Association (NUTA) today registered their protest with the Jaffna university authorities over the involvement of undergraduates in the so-called Mullivaikkal Remembrance Day observances.
NUTA Secretary Prof. Channa Jayasumana asked Jaffna University Vice Chancellor Ratnam Vigneswaran not to allow racist politicians to exploit the university students for their ends.
While the general population of Jaffna was mostly uninvolved, the Jaffna University students were acting like the unofficial private army of the Northern Province Chief Minister C.V. Vigneswaran and transgressing the law of the country by commemorating members of a banned terrorist organization. People in the South hold intelligent youth of the Northern peninsula in high esteem. However, their recent behaviour showed that they are being misguided by crafty racist politicians such as C.V. Vigneswaran, who himself never studied in the North. Not a single member of the Chief Ministers family has studied in the North. He is sending the intelligent youth of the north and east to the dungeon while his family members are safe abroad or in Colombo. Our understanding is that the recent incidents create an unsavoury picture about the Jaffna University among the majority of Sinhala and Muslim people in the country. The end of the internal armed conflict widened the path for the young people in the North and East to obtain university education. Otherwise they would be conscripted by the terrorists and living in a bunker, suffering immense difficulties, under the command of a thug. Those misguided youths should be thankful to the political leadership and Sri Lankan forces that ended the armed conflict and made it possible for them to reap the benefits of higher education freeing them from the battlefront.
We observe that greedy politicians are pushing the misguided youth to another reckless programme. Further, we feel that they are abandoning the golden opportunities presented to them by the people of Sri Lanka. We do hope that you would take our letter seriously and discuss this matter with senior responsible academics in the University, offer guidance to Jaffna University students and teach them reconciliation and harmony, he said in his statement.

Proper policies  needed to accelerate future journey
	

History reveals that Sri Lanka has developed several unique disciplines and skills in areas like native treatment and agriculture that could be found nowhere in the world

The new leader should also prepare the mindset of the people
	Our ancient kings had applied highly advanced constitutional theories in the past
	No country has yet reached development by following instructions of the IMF


Should we continue to tolerate empty speeches by political leaders who are incapable of delivering and have led this country and the society into chaos and deterioration In this backdrop The need for an actionable vision for Sri Lanka has been re-emphasized with a new vision for an intellectually inspired Sri Lanka placed before the people. 
Viyath Maga gathered an impressive number of Professionals to the Shangri-La Hotel, Colombo to figure out the importance, purpose and the depth of that theme. Its Chairman Gotabaya Rajapaksa in his keynote address emphasized the need for Sri Lanka to get prepared to meet Global Economic challenges. Presentations were made using different perspectives by the professionals to identify possible avenues through which this island could move towards development and prosperity by taking the advantage of the unique geographical location of Sri Lanka in the Indian Ocean. 
To achieve such goals this country needs a highly disciplined, firm and straightforward, intelligent, innovative and patriotic leader with skills on strategic planning. However, the future leader should also possess the capacity to advance inner spiritual powers and receive the blessings of external spiritual forces, as had been done in the past by our Kings who took the country to the apex of development and contentment.

I pen this article to underscore a few challenges that our future leaders may confront and offer directions that they may choose. 
Sovereignty and regulatory framework
The rise of China and India as world economic super powers and their strategic expansion of influence throughout Asia will not let Sri Lanka remain in isolation. Sri Lanka will have to link with global economic networks and therefore require necessary expertise to play her unique role in the global economy. In that, Sri Lanka would be placed in a do-or-die situation, since if we fail in strength and skill to stand and survive in such a competitive global environment, our country will necessarily be subjected to more exploitation. 
In a legal sense countries create trade links based on Trade Agreements. Whatever the legal nature of such documents is, when entering into international treaties and agreements, countries are compelled to expose their domestic sovereignty to the danger of being subjected to foreign sovereignties. To avoid such threats of legal and economic interference, countries need to strengthen their domestic constitutional and legal-regulatory framework and have a sound International Trade Policy. The question is do we have the necessary laws and regulations to meet such dangers Unfortunately Sri Lanka has not yet prepared the domestic legal framework or national trade policy in order to acquire the competencyto enter into trade agreements and create trade or economic relationships with foreign sovereignties. 
For example,the main criticism against the Sri Lanka-Singapore Free Trade Agreement is the failure of the Government to evaluate the adverse impact on it by the domestic legal framework of Singapore. On the other hand Sri Lanka does not have necessary laws, regulations and administrative machinery to face the highly competitive economic environment that would be created by the integrated liberalized economic jurisdictions. Therefore, it is like a Giant dealing with a Child, as the two countries are not equal in their respective domestic regulatory frameworks, legal and administrative systems. Such inequality shall always place our country at a disadvantage when implementing the provisions of the agreement. Irrespective of the theoretical equality appearing on the face of the agreement, at the end of the day Sri Lanka would be exposed to an unregulated inflow of goods and services from abroad (as a result of the absence of internal regulatory framework) while on the other hand- it would be much harder to have the same effect on the opposite direction (due to restrictions imposed by domestic laws and regulations of Singapore). 
Therefore, one of the challenges a future leader will have to meet is to expeditiously formulate a favourable National Trade Policy (on international trade) and the necessary laws, re-structure the state administration. 
Nationalization
A former Judge of the Supreme Court and former Vice President of the International Court of Justice stated However elaborate or simple, Third World societies thus afforded a central place for the group concept, without which they could neither be understood or administered...what follows (from this examination) is the lack of appropriateness of Western concepts of individual freedom adopted without adaptation to their Third World setting. Accordingly it is impractical to adopt here the laws that originated in the Western world, without adjusting them in line with the thinking and behaviour of Asian societies. Our ancient kings had applied highly advanced constitutional theories in the past, which are still unknown to Western Jurisprudence. 
This argument is equally applicable to the theories and principles on economy as well. According to economists, we should formulate our own theories consistent with the native thinking and practices. No country has yet reached development by following instructions of the IMF. 
When it comes to culture, even the Westerners have now rejected some of their own behavioral patterns and lifestyles that are detrimental to human survival. Unfortunately some of our people still embrace these discarded behavioral patters due to psychological manipulations done through the internet. In that sense it is questionable whether we have true freedom of thinking and a clear conscience. 
We have to have our own socio-economic-legal machinery based on the aspirations, needs, practices and thinking of our people. Peoples active participation in all these areas could only be assured by attracting the participation of people to such endeavours. 
This does not mean the total rejection of Western knowledge, expertise and experiences. 
Identify national potential
Much discussion has been devoted to the proper utilization of multi-skilled human resources. However, the present education system is based on preparing students to confirm and comply in the application of knowledge. Therefore, much emphasis is needed to introduce drastic changes to inspire innovative thinking and to inculcate human values. Sri Lanka has the capacity to be a major service provider in the field of higher education through world recognized national universities; and a better international brand to secure its position in the world economy. 
But real challenges remain elsewhere. During the long passage of history Sri Lanka has developed several unique disciplines and skills that could be found nowhere in the world. Native treatment systems and indigenous medicine, agricultural and irrigation systems, engineering techniques, various culture related disciplines, (dancing, singing, martial arts etc.), Theravada Buddhist Philosophy and contentment practices are some of such unique areas a future leader should directly integrate into the Sri Lankan economy. 

National harmony
The Sri Lankan society has been harmonious and united throughout with a high level of tolerance when compared with most other societies. From 2015 the Government wasted valuable time and resources in attempting to make a new constitution, where the main objective was purported reconciliation. Reconciliation, is a word/concept imposed on us by several elements with international support and having ulterior motives. 
The challenge is to deviate from conventional and untested solutions for hypothetical issues artificially created in the minds of the people with ulterior political motives. Most of the differences leading to disharmony in society are related with finance and economy. We need not waste time on constitutional reforms or devolution of power to uphold solidarity of the people. Instead we need a leadership that can drive the entire community towards prospective economic goals with poverty eradication mechanisms. Providing each and every individual with the opportunity to play his role with dignity in the modern economic environment will see the diminishing of all racial, ethnic or other differences and the integration of the entire nation into one family. 
Geopolitical constraints
The biggest challenge a future leader would face are geopolitical constraints. From the defeat of brutal terrorism in 2009, international pressure and interference escalated in an unprecedented scale, which ultimately led to a regime change in 2015. Since then the domestic governance was compelled (in different degrees) to be carried out in accordance with the three international powers that are competing with each other to have the major share of influence in South Asia and the Indian Ocean. 
Setting the path
To accelerate the journey towards prosperity, the new leadership should be ready with the necessary legal - economic structural framework for immediate implementation. The new leader should also prepare the mindset of the people to function with maximum productivity in the new socio-economic environment. The valuable contribution of professionals should be reaped in this regard. 
The mental attitude of the people should also change when utilizing modern concepts, theories and techniques of innovation, so that spiritual and human values and patriotism are also considered as essential for a contented society. A new leadership should stand above all cultural, racial and other barriers and differences, for a mandate to build an intellectually inspired and prosperous Sri Lanka.

Remembering the dead: JVP vs LTTE
	
Recently, there was a rather ridiculous debate after Minister Rajitha Senaratne, who as the Cabinet Spokesman has a knack for putting his foot in the mouth, equated the JVP to the LTTE. JVP MP Vijitha Herath and Minister Champika Ranawaka objected to the comparison. By any definition, both are nihilistic terroristic groups that unleashed unspeakable carnage upon this country. However, the argument goes that the JVPs gruesome record of 1988-89 is much less egregious than the LTTE. Those who viewed it that way ignore one pivotal fact: The JVP was stopped in the midway of its campaign of terror by an equally bloody campaign of counter terror, without which the contemporary history of Sri Lanka would have been much different. Of all terrorist and insurgent groups in recent times, few came closer to recreate a Khmer Rouge styled killing field as the JVP did in 1989. That mass calamity was avoided, of course at a considerable cost, by a ruthless but effective state response. 
And the JVP is now the old story. Even its cadres do not glorify their blood drenched lunacy in the past (Mr. Wijeweeras wife calls her husband a mass murderer.) 
In contrast to its efficient execution of a counter insurgency campaign against the JVP, successive governments pussyfooted before the LTTE. That was in part because, the LTTE for a long time, did not pose to the power centres of Colombo a threat equivalent to that was posed by the JVP. Bombs went off periodically, there were regular assassinations and about four hundred security personnel were killed in the first phase of the Eelam war from 1983 to the signing of the Indo-Lanka Peace Accord in 1987. However, there was never a threat of State capture. The political vacillation and Indian intervention in 1987 enabled the LTTE to escalate its armed campaign; each new phase of the Eelam war witnessed an extra venom and accelerated rate of death and destruction.  
Had the earlier governments made a concerted effort to defeat the LTTE, the destruction of a three decade of the civil war, and the civilian casualties of its final phase could have been avoided. Instead, successive leaders subordinated the terrorist problem in the North to their own electoral and political considerations in the South. The greatest such miscalculation was President Premadasas decision to send back Indian peacekeepers who were by then had driven the LTTE to the jungles and were preparing for the final assault. We could have got the Indians who, themselves created the problem, to do our dirty work, and save the country from two more decades of destruction. 

The LTTE inflicted significant cost on the country, economy and the Southern centric political establishment. But, all that pales in comparison to the destruction it wrought upon the Tamil people. Compare the status of Tamil community in this country in 1980, when one in three every charted accountant, lawyer, civil servant was a Tamil, and Jaffna was the second richest city in the country to their existence today. That is what the JVP could have done for us in the South had it been given a chance.  

In contrast to its efficient execution of a counter insurgency campaign against the JVP, successive governments pussyfooted before the LTTE.
That was in part because, the LTTE for a long time, did not pose to the power centres of Colombo

The post -1989 response in the South to the States counter-terrorism campaign was not much different from what is now seen in the North. There was a mothers front that was actively campaigning for justice, and supported the election of President Chandrika Kumaratunga, who after her election set up a large-scale inquiry into the dead and missing, which received around 29,000 complaints. Nothing much happened in the follow up, but the South moved on. That chapter in the history was closed, and few really wants to reopen it, doing so would do much damage than any solace it would bring in. 
The North could well follow the same pattern, except for one reason. There is a lot of vested interest in some quarters of Tamil politics, diaspora and NGO in keeping the book open. They are not doing a service to Tamils.
On the other hand, Sri Lanka cannot ban the mourning of the dead, and claims it is striving for reconciliation. In fact, such misguided State intervention in the past complicated things and added to the disenchantment of the Tamil community. Mourning could help healing in its small ways. In the meantime, the government should address the grievances of civilians who lost loved ones and adequate reparations should be paid.
However, one should also not miss the reality that Tamil nationalist forces who were organising these events in Mullivaikkal were patently anti-Sri Lankan. The government should prevent those grievances from being exploited for another phase of radicalisation of Tamils. These groups and individuals need to be watched. Such vigilance would be in the interest of the country as a whole and Tamil people in the North in particular. That would prevent them being herded to another Mullivaikkal.

Sketches from the South: Towards Matara
	
At first glance, the sights, the sounds, the flavours, and even the people appear like a poor reflection of their counterparts from Galle. First you come across the Star Fort, which resembles a bared down version of the more famous Fort from that other part of the South. Then you come across the beaches, which resemble and remind you of Unawatuna and Koggala. Then you walk around and realize that, yes, while these are sites you have seen elsewhere along the coastal belt, they are not all there is to see here and probably not the main sites to come across, record, and write about. The real Matara, in that sense, lies beyond the beaches, the rest houses, the sights, sounds, and flavours. Less packed in than Galle, and less urbanized than most places leading up to it, it is a veritable tourist hub and destination  if you know which spots to patronize and which people to talk with.
Matara is, I have come to feel, a paradox. While less urbanized than Galle, and by default less packed in, it concentrates its streak of opulence alongside the coast and within the town. Symbols of conspicuous consumption adorn both sides of the road, as you travel along the beaches to the Rest House. A huge cavalcade of Cargills, Perera & Sons, and several big name fashion houses and dress points is what you come across here. It seems as though Matara is a repository of big spending, given these. But then the statistics tell a different story.

Galle stands out in terms of tourist destinations is not really the city, but rather the surrounding hamlets: Unawatuna, Koggala, and even further beyond
According to the census data from 2016, the inhabitants of Matara spend less relative to their income (75%) compared with the people of Galle (84%). However, this apparent spendthrift habit conceals another reality: in terms of bank loans, the people of Matara tend to borrow more (around Rs. 320,000 per household) and spend proportionately more on food (36%) when compared with Galle (Rs. 290,000 and 34% respectively). That opulent streak is limited to the town, yes, but the habit of spending, and spending on food at that, runs riot in other parts of this region. This has not come about at the cost of equality, by the way; as the statistics make it quite clear, Matara ranks as one of the least unequal places in the South, with a Gini coefficient of 0.39.
What makes Galle stand out in terms of tourist destinations is not really the city, but rather the surrounding hamlets: Unawatuna, Koggala, and even further beyond. That tourist line ends, I rather think, in Weligama and Mirissa, at least in terms of beaches, seafood restaurants, and various other exotic sites. In Matara you are limited for the most when it comes to beaches to Polhena, and if you travel further on, to Hiriketiya and Medawatta. But these are packed in, smaller than Unawatuna, and they predictably attract so many crowds that solace and contemplation, as a traveller that is, is simply not possible.
So if youre in Matara, you might in all good faith have to tear yourself away from those beaches, and though they exude a clear, lucid sheen against the sun, they are secondary to the other sites you can traverse through here. But even those sites  to name a few, the Weherahena Temple, Dondra Point, the lighthouse at Dondra, and the famous, world renowned Hummanaya  are not enough. They are more than adequate to fill your diary and travel notebooks. That, however, is not all there is to travelling in Matara.

No matter how culturally archaic Ambalangoda and Galle may be, they have come to resemble their more commercialized suburbs in Colombo
First and foremost, there are the people. As with Ambalangoda, a linguistic hotspot its own right, the most distinctive characteristic of the inhabitants of Matara is the way they speak. And its not just the dialect or their mode of speech; its also their lexicon. In this part of the country you come across one of the most localized variants of Sinhala, and you encounter an entire dictionary of terms denoting things, emotions, and gestures, both tangible and intangible, which you might at times find bizarre. Perhaps because of this bizarreness, people from here, once they choose to leave their hometown and reside at least temporarily in Colombo, drop that mode of talking. At one level, I think this is a sign of how inferior they feel, and at another level, I think its also an inevitability, given the development spate and the drive towards eradicating local cultures that weve necessitated in the name of progress and efficiency. Sinhala, unlike English (the variants of which evolved out of class hierarchies), retains its diglossia and distinction between the written and the spoken variety owing to the fact that the people of those days, who talked in a particular way, were restricted from visiting other regions. In other words, immobility, not progress, was what preserved these dialects. If this is so, then the only real solution I can see is to stop visiting other neighbourhoods and be where you are.

Piyasena Kahandagamage, in his seminal but somewhat overlooked book Pradeshiya Vivaharaya, has recorded many of those terms which form various regional dialects and variants of the mawbasa. Its fascinating to see how many of them have entered everyday usage, and from the South and Matara in particular: thunapaha, hapana, hamine, iyum piyum, and that most endearing of all terms tossed between loved ones and spouses, eyi. But then there are those lesser encountered terms, which in one sense sound almost exotic to us: goiya for a person, makkayi for what, bin allanawa for planting a seed, and perhaps the most bizarre of them all, dodanna for talk. As Kahandagamage astutely notes, the speech patterns of the South are more or less spread along Giruwa Pattuwa, Magam Pattuwa, and last but not least, Matara Wellabada and Kandabada Pattuwa. (Beyond these, one must visit Galle: Rathgama, Balapitiya, and Ambalangoda. But with the spate of urbanization and Westernization in these areas, those patterns are being wiped out.) The true, authentic Matara, moreover, exists away from the coastline, and is to be found most acutely in Walasmulla, Akuressa, and Dickwella, among various other hamlets.
The unwary tourist, bombarded with brochures and guides telling him or her what to do and what to visit, tends to miss these places because what sells in the tourism industry is what everyone knows about. Near Walasmulla and bordering Hambantota, for instance, there is Mulkirigala, named Adams Berg by the Dutch once they conquered this part of the island (they got it confused with Adams Peak). Constructed in the third century, Mulkirigala is culturally significant, not least owing to the historical record that one of the 32 Bo saplings brought to Sri Lanka by Sangamitta Thera was planted there. Away from Walasmulla, and closer to the coastline, there is then Dickwella, which houses the sprawling and at times controversial Wewurukannala Raja Maha Viharaya: home to the largest seated Buddha statue in Sri Lanka (at 160 feet). Is it any wonder, I thought to myself as I gazed at this statue, that it is almost as forgotten by outsiders as that other temple in Ambalangoda, the Galagoda Viharaya, which happens to house the largest reclining statue in not just Sri Lanka, but also South Asia These records have escaped the eye of the unwary traveller, a pity because they neednt have escaped him at all.

Matara is less urbanized than Galle, and by default less packed in. It concentrates its streak of opulence alongside the coast and within the town

Visiting Matara, or for that matter Galle or Ambalangoda, with the intention of talking with the natives is probably the most Orientalist project you, as a traveller, can commit on this island. No one wants to be seen as a member of his town or village if he or she is seen purely in terms of the parameters of that town and village. At another level, this can almost be seen as condescending, and Sri Lankans, particularly from the South, are too proud (and rightly so) to let the outsider judge them on the yardsticks of hometowns and origins such outsiders create by, and for, themselves. Getting into the roots of a place requires getting into the skins of its inhabitants, but not with the intention of seeing the natives for who you or someone else thinks they are. (E. M.Forster, in A Passage to India, depicts this side of Anglo-India, through the imperialists who wish to see the real India. Coming to Sri Lanka to see the real Matara, the real Galle, etc, is no different.)

No matter how culturally archaic Ambalangoda and Galle may be, they have come to resemble their more commercialized suburbs in Colombo. Compare that with the unevenness of the economic development in Matara, you can understand how the people of this region, and beyond (Tangalle and Hambantota), tend to be uneven in their dealings with the outside world. They do talk straight, but they also talk at cross purposes, leaping from one topic to another, rarely curt or short. In that sense, the inhabitants are far more deserving representatives of this region than the beaches, or even the religious sites.

This one too is more equal than others
	

This strange case of granting compulsory leave with half pay to a service high-up facing murder charges now confined to a state-run lodge, has raised many eyebrows in political circles and the public domain.

According to the relevant administrative regulations, the high-up should have been interdicted given the gravity of the charges he is facing apart from the fact that he has been refused bail by courts, but the authorities concerned had for reasons unknown deviated from the normal disciplinary procedure and sent the man on compulsory leave, they say.
What is worse is that even a superior one who had recommended serving an interdiction order on the service high-up has now been relieved of his normal duties which have been now been delegated to another bigwig.
The high-up now serving time in the state-run- lodge is provided with best possible comforts and facilities, they say.

War heroes and cheap political mileage
	
Army Commander Lieutenant General Mahesh Senanayake has called on all concerned not to use war heroes for political propaganda, which of course is a timely advice as almost all parties, especially the two main -- the United National Party (UNP) and the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) unofficially led by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa -- use the soldiers who sacrificed their lives to gain political mileage. 
This is a unique country where political leaders and their cohorts, whose lives had been threatened with death for over three decades due to a gruesome civil war, are not in a position to commemorate those who laid their lives in the course of eradicating that threat, in one place. The former President and other leaders of his party singly celebrated the victory of the countrys armed forces over the separatist rebel group Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), while government leaders held the official State commemorative ceremony with the participation of the armed forces.
Rajapaksa wants to hold moral high ground by holding separate ceremonies and thereby lay claim to war victory. During these ceremonies, nothing was mentioned about the war time army commander Sarath Fonseka, who was called by the leaders of the Rajapaksa regime -- when they were in good terms -- the best army commander in the world. The same hypocrisy was the norm during the governments official ceremony where similar treatment was given to the former President and former Defence Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa, the man who bridged the hitherto existed gap between the political and military leaderships during the war, leading to the ultimate victory. Besides, government leaders attempted to outsmart the Rajapaksas in treating the armed forces, by declaring that it was during their tenure that international pressure over human rights violations -- hanging over the heads of the armed forces like the Sword of Damocles -- was eased.
The Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission (LLRC) appointed by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa in 2010 concluded its report with a recommendation to assign a national day for the collective commemoration of all those killed in the war -- soldiers, LTTE cadres and civilians -- with a view to psychologically unite and assimilate the communities in the country. It is now vividly evident that it is a utopian suggestion in light of even political parties within a particular community being unable to get together in one place to remember those who they claim have laid their lives to protect the people of the country.
The key point both parties and the country have forgotten or been indifferent to, is that despite the armed conflict ended nine years ago, the governments of both groups have failed to bring in much needed reconciliation.
The Tamil society is still venerating the LTTE leadership, which is manifest through the Tamil media and political leadership, which is attempting to gain mileage with that mindset of the Tamil people. One cannot deem this is a situation which sprang abruptly or after the Maithri-Ranil coalition came into being. This attitude prevailed among the Tamils even when the armed forces overran the last bunker line of the LTTE on the banks of the Nandikkadal lagoon in the Mullaitivu District on May 19, 2009 and had been suppressed by the new situation that was created by the decimation of the LTTE leadership.
Rajapaksas had about six years and the Maithri-Ranil combine three to win over the Tamils and change this mindset. But both groups failed miserably. And they blamed each other when Tamil people thronged in Mullivaikkal to light flames in the names of LTTE leaders along with those of their kith and kin. In fact, it is appropriate for one to ask whether the governments really wanted to assimilate the Tamil community into the Sri Lankan body politic.
