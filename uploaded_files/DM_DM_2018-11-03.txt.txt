Coalition says it hit airbase in rebel-held Yemen capital
	

RIYADH AFP Nov2, 2018-A Saudi-led coalition fighting in Yemen said Friday it attacked an airbase in the rebel-held capital Sanaa, a day after the Saudi-backed government offered to restart peace talks with the insurgents. 
This operation includes targeting of ballistic-missile launch and storage locations... bomb-making and assembly workshops and their support locations in Al-Dailami Airbase in Sanaa, coalition spokesman Turki al-Malki said in a statement. 
He added that the adjoining Sanaa international airport was still open to air traffic from the United Nations and other relief agencies.
Calling the attacked structures legitimate military targets, Malki said he will provide evidence of violations by the Iran-aligned Huthi rebels later Friday. 
The development comes a day after the Yemeni government said it welcomed all efforts to restore peace following calls by key US officials and the UNs envoy to Yemen Martin Griffiths for warring parties to come to the table within a month. 
US Defence Secretary Jim Mattis and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo have called for an end to the Yemen war, including air strikes by the coalition. 
Washington, a close Saudi ally, backs coalition forces by refuelling their jets and selling them

How Muslim women were encouraged in education
	

Many scholars, teachers and colleagues have written much about A.M. A. Azeezs contribution to Muslim education, but very little is known about his thoughts in the sphere of Muslim Womens education in Sri Lanka. Having benefitted greatly from his work in the field of Muslim Womens education, it is only befitting to share a few thoughts regarding Azeezs ideas on education and status of Muslim Women in Sri Lanka.
Azeez realised at a very early stage that the lack of education was the main reason for the backwardness of the Muslims. He urged young men to follow higher education; also with a few like-minded friends, founded a Scholarship Fund to help needy students. His concern for education led him to retire prematurely from the Ceylon Civil Service in 1948 and take up the post of Principal at Zahira College Colombo.
Azeez then concentrated on education with the idea of ensuring the progress of the Muslim community. At Zahira College he set about establishing a well stocked library  reading, he said was the prerequisite for a good education! He appointed dedicated and efficient teachers from all communities and with varying ideologies; and also encouraged students irrespective of their community, to enter Zahira. He felt that these measures would be beneficial to Muslim students and would give them an understanding of each others religion and culture. This he believed would pave the way for tolerance and communal amity. Muslims should not, he said, adopt a frog-in-the-well attitude!
What of the education of Muslim Women The Holy Quran stresses the importance of the pursuing knowledge and education. During the latter part of the 19th Century, therefore, some interest was taken in educating Muslim girls by those personages like Siddi Lebbe, who wanted to improve educational standards among the Muslims including Muslim girls. In 1891, Lebbe established the first school for Muslim girls in Kandy, followed by another in Gampola and then in Kurunegala. These schools, however were failures resulting from parental indifference.
In 1923 Dr M C M Kaleel, an ardent supporter of education for Muslim women, stated, As long as we keep our sisters in the dark, we are depriving ourselves of over 50% of the benefits that education brings to each family and the community.
Sir Razik Fareed urged the Government to establish schools only for girls so that Muslim parents would send their daughters, but only a small percentage made use of these schools. Even up to the 1940s there was opposition to educating Muslim girls.

Taking a great step
In 1946 Muslim LadiesCollege was established at a new premises in Colombo, with the encouragement of Sir Razik Fareed. Ayesha Rauf was appointed as Principal. Azeez welcomed the establishment of the school and he hoped that this Muslim girls school would follow the same systems that he introduced at Zahira College. To him this was a great step forward in promoting education for Muslim women.
As stated by the Poet/Philosopher Allama Muhammed Iqbal, Azeez believed that Education being a preparation for life is needed by all, the rich as well as the poor, the male as well as the female. He was a fervent supporter of womens rights to higher education and to gain a University degree- a notion that was the result of his educational background.

Azeez realised at a very early stage that the lack of education was the main reason for the backwardness of the Muslims

Azeez was from an educated family of Moor street Jaffna. Most of the families, in Jaffna, including the women were literate. They were not English-educated, but were well-versed in Arabic, Tamil and Arabic-Tamil (Tamil written in the Arabic script enriched by many Arabic words). Young girls attended the Madrasas with young boys; later they enrolled in schools near-by but did not continue schooling after puberty.
Although Moor Street was demarcated as a Muslim area there was much interaction and friendship with the Tamil community; in fact Azeez attended Vaidyeswara Vidyalayam and later Jaffna Hindu College. Perhaps this was why Azeez became a very liberal-minded person and was keen on friendship and understanding among all communities.

The right of women
Azeez has often said that it was his mother who instilled the faith in Allah and the importance of education not only for males, but for females too. Guided by his mother, the children of the family learned to recite the Holy Quran and the meaning in their spoken language, Tamil. They read Islamic works in Arabic-Tamil and in Tamil. It was at this time that Azeez began to be interested in education for girls; he encouraged his cousin Sithy Khadija to sit the London Matriculation, for which she attended Holy Family Convent, Jaffna. She passed this exam, but in keeping with the times did not continue further.
Azeez was adamant about the right of women to higher education and of their right to gain a University degree. He disapproved of the prevalent Purdah system (seclusion) and the un-Islamic dowry system. The Purdah system hampered the education of women. They did not attend school after puberty. They were secluded and taught to recite the Holy Quran and to read the Hadiths within the confines of their homes; at most they also learned Islamic songs. In addition, girls were taught cooking and sewing to prepare them for an early marriage.
The Purdah system was prevalent even up to the 1950ties and was practiced rigidly. It was at such a time, that Azeez encouraged the education of Muslim girls and discouraged the dowry system.
He stated that education would end, at least discourage the dowry system and it certainly did. He also expressed the belief that an educated mother would bring up disciplined and educated children who would want to better themselves - a necessity for the progress of the community. He expressed these views in his speeches, writings and at seminars and discussions. To a great extent his efforts were successful and many young women were allowed to follow teacher-training courses.
From the 1950 ties onwards, the contribution of Azeez and like-minded Muslims such as Siddi Lebbe, Dr Kaleel and Sir Razik Fareed spearheaded the education Muslim women who had taken up the challenge to pursue higher education and were aspired to gain University degrees and professional qualifications. Their efforts have made women independent. They are able to contribute to the family income resulting in an improved standard of living. They can also encourage their offspring to pursue education and help themselves and the community prosper.
These educated Muslim women are able to stand successfully alongside educated women of other communities with confidence. They have taken to many professions and hold responsible positions in Business. They have motivated other Muslim women to pursue higher education and gain employment. This augurs well for the Sri Lankan Muslim community.

India among eight countries allowed to buy oil from Iran after US sanctions
	

Hindustan Times, Nov 02, 2018-The US has agreed to let eight countries -- including Japan, India and South Korea -- keep buying Iranian oil after it reimposes sanctions on the OPEC producer on November 5, a senior administration official said. 
While the Trump administrations goal remains to choke off revenue to Irans economy, waivers are being granted in exchange for continued import cuts so as not to drive up oil prices, said the official, who asked not to be identified before secretary of state Michael Pompeo announces the number of exemptions later on Friday. 
China  the leading importer of Iranian oil  is still in discussions with the US on terms, but is among the eight, according to two people familiar with the discussions who also asked not to be identified. The other four countries that will get waivers werent identified.

The administration must maintain a delicate balancing act with the waivers: ensuring the oil market has sufficient supply and avoiding a politically damaging spike in fuel prices, while also ensuring that Irans government doesnt collect enough revenue that the US sanctions become irrelevant. 
Global benchmark Brent crude has fallen about 15 percent from over $85 a barrel last month on increasing speculation that at least some nations will get waivers, as well as signs that other OPEC members will pump more to offset any supply gap. Oil futures were at $73.04 a barrel at 7:12 am in London on Friday.

The United Peoples Freedom Alliance (UPFA) has informed Speaker Karu Jayasuriya that it has no intention of replacing him under the new government.
The UPFA leaders met him at an informal meeting on Wednesday to discuss arrangements for the first session of Parliament after the prorogation. The Speaker said Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa would be assigned his seat on the government side and that the new ministers would also be allocated seats based on seniority.
When the Speaker said, he might also lose his post, the UPFA leaders said they had no intention of removing him and instead they expected the Speaker to discharge his duties impartially as the custodian of Parliament. (Kelum Bandara)

Let the confusion subside
	
On October 26, political confusion broke out in Sri Lanka. President Sirisena who had for months been carrying on a running battle with his Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, without a warning announced, out of the blues so-to-say, had appointed the popular and charismatic former President Mahinda Rajapaksa as his Prime Minister.

He added, in an almost after-thought, that he had sacked Ranil Wickremesinghe, the leader of the United National Party from his premiership as the Cabinet of Ministers had collapsed following the withdrawal of the United Peoples Freedom Alliance (UPFA) from the United National Front (UNF) Government which Mr. Wickremesinghe led. He also prorogued Parliament.
While the writing on the wall for the so-called Government of National Unity has been clear to all, it was the speed at which events unfolded that took the entire nation by surprise.
Concerned citizens remain confused, many questioning whether the Presidents action was ultra vires of the Constitution. They wonder whether it could lead to a breakdown in the rule of law, pondered whether it would lead to attempts to interfere in the system of justice in the country and how the ongoing stalemate will affect the national economy.
Both leading political parties -- the UNP and the SLPP -- and their supporters claim to be acting within the Constitution. While ex-premier Wickremesinghe claims he is the lawful Prime Minister and remains at the official residence, Temple Trees, newly-appointed Prime Minister Rajapaksa is now operating the day-to-day business of the country from the Prime Ministers Office at Flower Road.
To add insult to injury, the arguments of our intellectuals are often coloured by their political loyalties as it is the case even in developed Western democracies.
Professor Rajiva Wijesinha says there is no need to reconvene Parliament, especially he adds, as the Constitution itself is ambiguous regarding the dismissal of a Prime Minister. He suggests letting the judiciary decide on the matter, reconvening Parliament or calling for general elections.
Trade union leader Dr. Wickremabahu Karunaratne has threatened to stage protests and riots against the removal of former PM Wickremesinghe and the prorogation of Parliament.
Jehan Perera of the National Peace Council has described the dismissal of the premier as unconstitutional and a former Permanent Representative to the UN wants to know why Western countries had not pointed out wrongdoings committed by the Wickremesinghe regime!
Leading members of the clergy too have taken partisan stands on the issue and a few have begun raising the scare of separatism compounding the existing confusion.
In the immediate aftermath of the transfer of power, supporters of the President and the new Prime Minister in trade union movements at the SLBC, the Rupavahini Corporation and the print media prevented the politically-appointed leadership of the outgoing regime from functioning in their capacities in respective institutions.
On Tuesday -- four days after Fridays tumultuous events -- former Prime Minister Wickremesinghes supporters finally took to the streets in his support and the following day supporters of the deposed premier drove away State officials who attempted to inspect documents at Temple Trees, raising fears that violence may escalate.
To make matters worse, representatives of foreign countries -- almost all belonging to the global West -- are beginning to involve themselves in the impasse which is highly uncalled for. Diplomats from a variety of Western countries led by the US and Britain are warning of consequences and have called for a reconvening of Parliament.
Unsurprisingly, ordinary citizens have been left confused and fearful over what the future may hold as the country continues without direction and in a state of flux.
In the Maldives, the Supreme Court made an intervention when the results of the recently held election were questioned.
In Pakistan too, it was the court of justice which ruled against President Musharaff and more recently decided the fate of then Prime Minister Nawaz Sheriff.
Can our politicians resolve this problem amicably or will our country too follow precedents set by Pakistan and the Maldives where courts of the land had to step in and take corrective action.

Machiavellian Moves  by Maithripala and Mahinda to Oust Ranil
	

Maithripala inextricably entangled himself in a Machiavellian political project


Sirisena-Rajapaksa duo wants at least 120 MPs on or before the 16th


Both sides engaged in intensive campaigning



By
D.B.S. Jeyaraj
Machiavelli is the only political thinker whose name has come into common use for designating a kind of politics, which exists and will continue to exist independently of his influence, a politics guided exclusively by considerations of expediency, which uses all means, fair or foul, iron or poison, for achieving its ends  its end being the aggrandizement of ones country or fatherland  but also using the fatherland in the service of the self-aggrandizement of the politician or statesman or ones party.- Leo Strauss

Niccol di Bernardo dei Machiavelli known as Niccolo Machiavelli (1469-1527) was an Italian diplomat, writer, historian and political philosopher who is regarded by some as the father of modern political science. His most famous work was the political treatise The Prince which gained notoriety because it supposedly justified duplicity and a cynical disregard for morality as acceptable means to achieve the ends of gaining or maintaining power. Machiavellianism derived from the name Machiavelli is a word used to describe the employment of cunning and duplicity in statecraft or general conduct. The term Machiavellian is often associated positively with pragmatic politics and negatively with political deception and deviousness.
Very few nations have been immune from the Machiavellian effect. The politics of almost every country would have experienced Machiavellianism in different degrees at different stages. Sri Lanka is no exception. The ongoing attempt by President Maithripala Sirisena to remove Ranil Wickremesinghe as Prime Minister and replace him with ex-President Mahinda Rajapaksa can arguably be described as an exercise in Machiavellian manipulation. Some have referred to President Sirisenas coup detat as Constitutional. This has been disputed by others who say descriptions like extra- Constitutional coup, unconstitutional coup or anti-Constitutional coup is more appropriate. Another school of thought supportive of Sirisena argues that the Presidents actions were Constitutionally valid.
This writer too opines that a bloodless (so far) coup detat has been effected to remove and replace the lawfully-elected Prime Minister. The unconstitutional action is totally anti-democratic and deserves to be condemned strongly. It must be emphasised that the objection is to the mode and manner in which this attempt to oust Ranil Wickremesinghe from the post of Prime Minister and replace him with Mahinda Rajapaksa has been made. Had Wickremesinghe been defeated at a no-confidence vote or if Mahinda Rajapaksa had been appointed after proving he commanded the confidence of the House through a floor test, there would have been no grounds to protest. Compounding the complicated situation further is the prorogation of Parliament to pave the way for high powered horse deals. The legislature is being turned into an auction house where the souls of the peoples representatives are being sold to the side putting forward attractive bids.

SRI LANKAN STUDENTS IN OVERSEAS UNIVERSITIES
A refreshing silver lining in the prevailing dark cloud is the spontaneous denouncing of President Sirisenas actions by a wide section of the nations democracy-loving people. Much of the criticism and condemnation amounted to sound, well-informed, non-partisan commentary. Among the various statements issued by different persons, groups and organisations, I would like to excerpt a few paragraphs from an open petition signed by a group of Sri Lankan students in overseas universities. These paragraphs sum up the situation succinctly. Here are the relevant excerpts - Since 1931, Sri Lanka has had an imperfect and fragile, yet electorally and legally mandated, democracy. On Friday the 26th of October, for the first time since Sri Lankas independence, an unconstitutional and illegal transfer of power occurred. President Maithripala Sirisena, violating his oath of office and the mandate given to him on January 8th 2015, attempted to appoint Mahinda Rajapaksa, Member of Parliament for the Kurunegala District, as Prime Minister.
This was unconstitutional. The 19th Amendment deleted the Presidents power to remove the Prime Minister at will. While the President still appoints the Prime Minister, he has no implied power of removal since this is now governed by explicit provisions in the Constitution. Moreover, the withdrawal of the UPFA from the national government makes no difference: the Constitution does not provide that Cabinet ceases to function, and therefore that the Prime Minister loses his position, when one party in a national government withdrawsits support.
In any event, there is a democratic means of settling this question  a test of confidence on the floor of Parliament. Yet President Sirisena and Mr. Rajapaksa did not propose a motion of no-confidence or engineer a defeat of the Budget to remove Prime Minister Wickremesinghe. Indeed even after Mr. Rajapaksas illegal appointment, President Sirisena decided to prorogue Parliament, demonstrating what was clear from the beginning: Mr. Rajapaksa did not have the confidence of a majority of the representatives of the people. His covert appointment, the illegal attempt to remove Prime Minister Wickremesinghe, the suspension of Parliament without consulting the Speaker, and the mob-led take-over of State media institutions make it clear that this is a coup detat.

TELEVISED ADDRESS TO THE NATION
President Maithripala Sirisena in his televised address to the nation on October 28 outlined his reasons for the removal of Ranil Wickremesinghe and appointment of Mahinda Rajapaksa. The address was not very convincing. If the intention was to win over the Sri Lankan people to his point of view, the speech-making turned out to be an exercise in futility. In a sense it was even counter-productive.
Although President Sirisena defended his actions by saying he had not acted unconstitutionally, he did not back up his assertion with solid supportive facts. He never even mentioned that Wickremesinghe was dismissed because the Prime Minister did not have a majority in the House. The President could not say that because it has not happened as yet. Instead he came out with a tirade of complaints against Ranil Wickremesinghe. The lengthy litany of woes demonstrated the personal level of animus held by Maithripala against Ranil. At the end of it, all the overall impression was that President Sirisena was prejudiced against Wickremesinghe and got rid of his Prime Minister because he could not get along with him and not for anything else.
Another huge howler was Maithripala Sirisenas failure to realise or grasp the irony of the situation while evoking memories about how he courageously contested the January 8, 2015 Presidential election amidst danger and hardship. The President said, I believe that you remember the circumstances under which I became the common candidate in 2014 and the dangers I had to face in consequence. It was a risk and a challenge that no politician in the history of the country wanted to accept. I faced this challenge despite the dangers to me and my family.
When Maithripala Sirisena revived memories about the dangers he faced while contesting the Presidency, the question that arises is - what were those dangers and from whom Who was his main electoral rival It was the then incumbent President Mahinda Rajapaksa. The dangers Maithripala faced then came from that quarter. When he hid with his family at a Dodangaslanda plantation or when he said tearfully that he may have been six feet under had he lost the polls, whom did he fear then Was it not Mahinda Rajapaksa And when he contested as common candidate was it not the UNP led by Ranil Wickremesinghe who supported him strongly Today the very same Sirisena was castigating Wickremesinghe and replacing him with Mahinda Rajapaksa as Prime Minister. It was indeed pathetic to see that Sirisena was totally oblivious to this irony!

MAHINDA BACK TO POWER THROUGH BACKDOOR
President Maithripala Sirisena after commencing his address to the nation stated as follows  On January 8, 2015, it was with so many expectations that nearly six million and two hundred thousand people of my country chose me as their first servant and the leader of this nation. I wish to pledge that I will always fulfil the expectations and honour the trust and faith you have placed in me, even at the cost of my life. What the President seemed to have conveniently ignored, overlooked or glossed over was the fact that more than six million people had voted for him so that Mahinda Rajapaksa could be defeated electorally. After receiving such a mandate then, Maithripala Sirisena had flagrantly flouted it and shocked those who voted for him by bringing in the same Mahinda Rajapaksa back to the seat of power through the back door!
This does not mean that President Sirisena was entirely wrong in apportioning blame on Ranil Wickremesinghe for certain acts of omission and commission. One does sympathise with President Sirisena when he refers to Ranils decadent cronyism by saying Mr. Wickremesinghe and his group of closest friends, who belonged to a privileged class did not understand the pulse of the people and conducted themselves as if shaping the future of the country was a fun game they played. One elsoempathises with the common man from Polonnaruwa when he pinpoints the differences between himself and the Royal Ranil by saying I noted that there were also differences of culture between Mr. Wickremesinghe and me. I believe that all those differences in policy, culture, personality and conduct aggravated this political and economic crisis. However, much one understands the rationale behind Sirisenas conduct against Ranil, he cannot be condoned for what he did and more importantly, how he did it.
What he did in a nutshell is this. President Sirisena removed Ranil Wickremesinghe from Prime Ministerial office while the UNP leader continued to retain the confidence of the majority of parliamentarians. President Sirisena has also appointed Mahinda Rajapaksa as Prime Minister even though he did not have the required majority in Parliament. Having done this, President Sirisena is now collaborating with the Rajapaksas to cobble together a majority by coaxing, cajoling or coercing MPs of all party hues. In order to gain enough time to facilitate this process of acquiring MPs, President Sirisena has arbitrarily prorogued Parliament until November 16. It is very likely that he may reconvene Parliament earlier than the specified date if the necessary number of MPs is garnered. Likewise, the President may also extend the prorogation further if the set target is not reached by November 16.

MY ENEMYS ENEMY IS MY FRIEND
It is blatantly clear that Maithripala Sirisena has inextricably entangled himself with this Machiavellian political project. Otherwise he would not have stated he would quit within an hour or two if Ranil Wickremesinghe returns as Prime Minister. Mahinda Rajapaksa too is intertwined with Maithripala Sirisena in this exercise to oust Ranil Wickremesinghe. It is a case of my enemys enemy is my friend or two enemies sinking their differences temporarily and getting together in a tactical alliance to destroy a common enemy. Both Maithripala and Mahinda seem to have forgotten how Sirisena defected after a meal of egg hoppers, teamed up with archrival UNP and defeated Medamulana Mahinda. There is a convergence of interests but there is no identity of interests. Thus, old wounds are likely to be reopened or new issues created after the common goal of ousting Ranil and consolidating power is realised.
A not-so-exact parallel that comes to mind is the brief honeymoon between the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) led by Velupillai Prabhakaran and the Sri Lankan Government and State headed by President Ranasinghe Premadasa in 1989-90. The Indo-Lanka accord had been inked and the Indian Army was in Northeastern Sri Lanka fighting the tigers. The nationalistic Premadasa feared Indian expansionism and had contested the 1988 Presidential poll on a platform of making the Indian Peace Keeping Force (IPKF) quit Lanka. Besides, the JVP was on a killing spree claiming to oppose India. On the war front, the LTTE was hard-pressed with India saturating the N-E region with a large number of troops. So Prabhakaran too needed a respite.
Both parties wanted the Indians out. Hence, both Premadasa and Prabhakaran arrived at an astounding agreement and ceasefire. This enabled Premadasa to demand the withdrawal of the Indian Army. The Indian Army left Lanka. At the same time, the armed forces were able to crush the JVP militarily. There was however only a temporary convergence of interests between the Premadasa Government and the Prabhakaran-led LTTE. There was no identity of interests. So, after the Indians left fully in March 1990, the old enmity surfaced and there was war again between the armed forces and LTTE in June 1990. Such a scenario is likely to be replicated again in the case of Maithripala and Mahinda too in a post-Ranil environment.

MINIMUM MAGIC NUMBEROF 113
There is however a lot of ground to be covered before this prognosis proves to be correct or incorrect. What matters is the here and now. The immediate objective of both the Maithripala-Mahinda camp as well as the Ranil Wickremesinghe camp is to win the numbers game. Both sides need the minimum magic number of 113 to gain a majority of at least in a legislature of 225. When the crisis began, the Ranil Wickremesinghe-led United National Front consisting of the UNP and other Tamil and Muslim parties had 107 seats, The SLFPs combined strength of the Sirisena-led UPFA and SLFP factions, the joint opposition  Podujana Peramuna MPs led by Mahinda Rajapaksa and the group of 16 SLFP/UPFA orphaned MPs numbered 95. After the splintering and defections began both sides now have over a 100 each. The Sirisena-Rajapaksa duo however wants at least 120 MPs in hand before a vote count is taken on or before the 16th.
The new Sirisena-Rajapaksa Government has 15 Ministers, 7 State Ministers and 7 Deputy Ministers. Almost all the ministers are from the SLFP factions and other parties like the EPDP, CWC and also UNP renegades. The core group of joint opposition MPs is not taking any posts so that those crossing over from other parties could be accommodated. Intensive campaigning is going on by both sides. On one side the focus is to entice as many MPs as possible from other parties. The other side is trying hard to prevent its membership from crossing over. It is also trying to woo a few MPs from the other side.
President Sirisena, his newly appointed Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa, brother Basil Rajapaksa and son Namal Rajapaksa are spearheading the hunt for MPs on one side. They are being aided by stalwarts such as Dulles Alahapperuma, S.B. Dissanayake, Susil Premajayantha and so forth. Gotabaya Rajapaksa issued a statement supporting the new government but has not engaged in fishing for MPs. A large number of UNP Parliamentarians along with influential UNP working committee members are canvassing on Ranil Wickremesinghes behalf. Chief among them are Mangala Samaraweera, Harin Fernando, Mujibur Rahman and Sagala Ratnayake. Also in the fray is Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga who has managed to prevent some MPs with an SLFP background from crossing over to Mahindas side.

WASANTHA SENANAYAKE AND VADIVEL SURESH
The situation is fluid and fickle. Loyalties and affiliations fluctuate rapidly. Two examples being that of Parliamentarians Wasantha Senanayake and Vadivel Suresh. Senanayake the great grandson of the Father of the Nation D.S. Senanayake, announces he is crossing over to Mahindas side from abroad. He returns to Lanka and meets Ranil Wickremesinghe assuring him of his loyalty. Wasantha then surfaces as a Cabinet Minister in charge of Tourism and Wildlife -- being sworn in by Sirisena. Vadivel Suresh is photographed wrapping a Ponnaadai (golden shawl) around Mahindas shoulders amidst speculation that he has gone over to the Rajapaksas. He is next seen sitting meekly with folded hands in front of Ranil explaining that he merely paid a courtesy call on Mahinda and blamed the media for distorting news. Then in another somersault Suresh is at the swearing in ceremony being sworn in as a State Minister of Plantation Industries by Sirisena.
Five UNPers including Senanayake and Suresh have defected to the Sirisena-Rajapaksa administration so far. The others are Dr. Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe, the new Minister of Education and Higher Education, Deputy Minister of Tourism and Wildlife Ananda Aluthgamage and State Minister of Environment Dunesh Gankanda. More UNP MPs are expected to follow this famous five in the near future.
The prize catch for which Basil Rajapaksa is angling is a group of UNP Parliamentarians led by Ravi Karunanayake. The former Finance and Foreign Affairs Minister is supposedly cheesed off with Ranil Wickremesinghe for not reappointing him minister as promised earlier. According to Ravis friends, Karunanayake feels Ranil is prevented from doing so by erstwhile ministerial colleagues Malik Samarawickrama and Kabir Hashim. Apparently, Ravi Karunanayake has earned the support of a Ginger Group of UNP backbenchers by dispensing financial favours during his stint as Finance Minister. At least seven of these MPs could follow Ravi into the Sirisena-Rajapaksa camp if Karunanayake opts to change sides. But the hitch is that Ravi Karunanayake wants the Finance or Foreign Affairs Ministry both of which cannot be given. He has been offered an alternative Economic Ministry which Ravi is reluctant to accept. However, Ravi Karunanayake was seen at the peoples protest in support of Ranil. He has also had a heart-to-heart chat with Wickremesinghe. Only time will tell whether Ravi remains loyal to Ranil or not.

EFFORTS ON TO WIN OVER UNP STALWARTS
Since talks with Ravi Karunanayake are yet to bear fruit, efforts are also underway to woo members of the UNP ginger group individually like Gampaha District MP Dr. Kavinda Jayawardana and Kandy District MP Mayantha Dissanayake. Intensive efforts are also on to win over other UNP stalwarts who are not so favourably inclined towards Ranil like Palitha Range Bandara, Lucky Jayawardena and Palitha Kumara Thewarapperuma. It is learnt that Thewarapperuma has rejected all offers but talks with the others are proceeding.
While the UNP was being targeted for crossovers, a segment of the SLFP too was in the throes of a crisis. A group of SLFP Parliamentarians led by SLFP General-Secretary and Cabinet Minister Duminda Dissanayake was reluctant to join with the Rajapaksa-led Government because they were not sure of their future under a Rajapaksa-led regime. Fundamentally they feared re-nomination at the next hustings. Dissanayake informed Maithripala that they would remain as an independent group in Parliament and abstain from voting. However, after several rounds of talks with Mahinda, Maithripala and Basil, an agreement was reached and guarantees were given. A group of 13 SLFP Parliamentarians including Duminda Dissanayake have now taken oaths as Ministers, State Ministers and Deputy Ministers. However, some others with SLFP antecedents like Lasantha Alagiyawanna and Hirunika Premachandra still remain within the Ranil camp mainly due to the restraining influence of Chandrika Kumaratunga.
Initiatives have also been taken to woo Muslim parties. A very friendly equation exists between All Ceylon Makkal Congress (ACMC) leader Rishad Bathiudeen and Basil Rajapaksa. According to ACMC sources senior MP Ameer Ali Shihabdeen conducted negotiations with Basil Rajapaksa because Rishad was out of the country. The Rajapaksas expect Rishad and Ameer Ali along with other ACMC Parliamentarians to cross over by November 5. The Industries and Commerce Ministry is being kept in readiness for Bathiudeen.
Since Sri Lanka Muslim Congress leader Rauff Hakeem is regarded as being close to the UNP and Ranil Wickremesinghe, the SLMC is perceived as being hard to get. However, Basil Rajapaksa is said to have made a breakthrough with Ampara District SLMC Parliamentarian M.H.M. Harees. He is apparently ready to jump ship and is also trying to bring along a few other fellow MPs from the SLMC along with him. At the same time some representatives of a Muslim religious organisation are trying to talk to Hakeem on behalf of Mahinda Rajapaksa and get the SLMC on board if possible.

MANO GANESAN ISSUED STATEMENT
As for the Tamil parties the solitary MP from the EPDP Douglas Devananda was one of the first to team up with Mahinda and has been given the same portfolio held by D.M. Swaminathan of the UNP earlier. The CWC with two MPs is also in with Mahinda. CWC leader Arumugam Thondaman has been entrusted with the same ministries that came under TPA leader P. Digambaram earlier. In an interesting move two MPs from the Up-Country Peoples Front V. Radhakrishnan and A. Aravindh Kumar have engaged in discussions with the Rajapaksas. The final outcome of the talks remains unknown. While Tamil Progressive Alliance leader Mano Ganesan has issued a statement to the effect that the Tamil and Muslim parties will be supportive of Ranil Wickremesinghe, it is learnt that at least one TPA MP from Kandy M. Velu Kumar is all set to cross over.
Finally we come to the two main opposition parties the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) and Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP). The JVP has been critical of both Ranil Wickremesinghe and Maithripala Sirisena. While there is no love lost between the JVP and UNP, the crimson comrades hate and perhaps fear the return of the Rajapaksas more. However it is too early to predict what the JVP will do.
The TNA with 16 MPs may very well be the decisive factor in determining who commands majority support in Parliament. It may be recalled that the TNA played a crucial role in helping to defeat the no-confidence motion against Ranil Wickremesinghe some months ago. The TNA however has not revealed its future course of action so far. TNA leader Sampanthan, deputy leader Senathirajah and spokesperson Sumanthiran have been supportive of Ranil Wickremesinghe in the past and are likely to be so in the future too. When TNA leader Sampanthan met with Mahinda Rajapaksa at the latters invitation, the veteran Tamil leader remained non committal when asked for support. The TNA is expected to play its cards close to its chest and is likely to take a decision only in the penultimate stages. However, talks are being held on behalf of Maithripala and Mahinda with some TNA MPs on an individual basis. It is learnt that discussions have taken place with Dharmalingam Siddharthan, Dr. S. Sivamohan, Charles Nirmalanathan and Sivasakthy Anandan so far. The aim seems to be to get some TNA Parliamentarians to abstain from voting even if they wont vote in support.

COUNT YOUR MPS, NAME THEM ONE BY ONE
This then is the current state of affairs was all bets are off and everything is up for sale. Frantic efforts are being made by both sides to form the majority or obtain majority support in Parliament. It remains to be seen whether the Machiavellian machinations of the Maithripala-Mahinda duo will succeed or not. There is a Christian hymn in which the chorus is Count your blessings, name them one by one. In the Sri Lankan Parliament, the chorus will be Count your MPs, name them one by one!

Maila Path Samanallu Poetry that touches on deep human emotions
	
In his collection of poetry Maila Path Samanallu Sujeewa Sirimewan touches on different layers of the human emotions. Starting with an unconventional foreword and a dedication he offers the reader an experience of a different dimension.
The first poem in the collection looks at the moonbeams from a different perspective. When the world has seen moonbeams through its color and the melancholy feeling it gives, in his poem Sanda Ras Laatu Laatu Sujeewa sees moonbeams as something which remain even after disappearing. As he does this he exposed us to a different dimension on the beauty of the moon. Even though the lover has left the guy who is narrating the poem, realises the remaining beauty of the moonbeams; which has the effect of glue that has stuck everywhere. Yet the lover is gone. This contradiction itself disturbs the mind of the reader and makes him have empathy towards the narrator.
Sujeewa offers Aththadanguwata as the second poem.

			
			Sujeewa
			
		
The title which translates into Remanded in English offers the same nostalgic feelings as the first one. In a way his poetries lullaby the reader, landing him or her into a world of unbearable loss. But at the same time the theme finding fulfillment when knowing love is carried throughout the book. All throughout the collection of poetries the writer showcases his skills to relate. The feelings one has for love when in remand are brought out well in the poem displaying the skills of a wordsmith.
In the peom Umbata baya hithenne nadda (arent you afraid) the writer brings out the changes in the common surrounding following separation. The dishes being in disarray, the loss of love and the breakup of a family are all detailed with a touch of tender human emotion. At the same time losing the narrators children due to the separation is combined with the fairytale like elements thus ending the poem with a question. It takes us back and forth through our own surroundings and to our childhood in a flash and at the same time shocks the reader by posing a question.
While shock waves are vibrating in readers memory, the narrator takes the former on a tour into the world of bare human emotions; caused due to losing physical contact with the person he loves and mentioned in his next poem. The sheer loneliness of sleeping alone in a bed made of loss is highlighted in the poem  Mata dan epa wela ( Im fed up now).
solitude
The bliss of solitude is explored in the poem Gmburu Muhudaka Hudakala Wemi (Ill isolate myself in the deep sea) with the underlying message of the lover being lost in another world. The separation of two worlds is explored within the solitude itself.
Obath Nowana Maath Nowana is one of the best creations in the collection where a train station is viewed through a different dimension, giving rise to the thought of long lost love. Here the poet puts in much effort in order to pull at the hearts strings of the reader.
In his poem Handaawa (Evening) the writer feels the nature. Here the concept of evening is viewed with a new perception. The impermanent nature of life is viewed within a glass of Brandy.  Kalela ( Scar) is a poem in which he touches on a scar which is physical as well as well as mental. The poet longs for a past through the memories evoked by a scar. This is one significant example of his skill to create poetry out of otherwise insignificant themes in life.
Wassak Anda Siththara ( When the rain created art) is a poem where the reader is made to view something from different viewpoints. Dominik Chandrasali, one of the poets and artist in Sri Lanka is referred to in this poem. This is one of the techniques Sujeewa uses in his collection of poetries the art of introducing other poets who are in his inner circle. In this poem, based on the rain, traditionally where rain can be viewed as an impressive scenario, the writer creates a story in the mind of the reader. Rain is viewed as something painted by a painter literally and figuratively as well. The underlining message here is that rain itself is a painter.
Oyai Magen Ahane (You are asking me) is a poem where sensual desires mix with love. The poem has the effect of a hot coffee on a rainy day.
Maga Areema (Avoiding) is a piece of writing where nostalgic memories are evoked in the readers mind as well. This is one of the poems where the reader easily relate to given that there are much missed moments in our lives.
Usually we would relate to the Wesak Poya Day (full moon day) in a manner in which we would only observe the beauty of the full moon. Here Sujeewa brings in a Wesak full Moon which is the same for a lagoon in the war-torn North, where the sound of bombs are reverberating in the mind while the South is devastated by a flood. The Wesak full moon will never be viewed in the same light again.
Solitude and loneliness of a flower are depicted with  Padi Pela Pamula Kaha Paata Mala ( Yellow flower at the foot of the staircase). This is another example where the writer uses a different dimension to absorb feelings of loneliness.
Winter is a time we get to see a snow-filled wonderland, yet the writer sees only dreary weather where everything is cold and dark. Only love can warm the cold feeling of the winter in, Irthu (Seasons).
The triangle of love is a traditional concept explored by many writers, but Sujeewa explores this concept in a dimension unparalleled to others.
Thrikona (Triangle) is where he explores this concept in a fresh dimension where the desire of a women is towards another woman. And the narrator is in love with the women, seeing the ladylike features but underneath there being the behaviour of a man. Imitation fails in the eyes of the narrator. This has to be rated as a gem of a poem in his collection.
He touches on controversial themes regarding sexual desires, sexual differences and emotions. No two poems are the same and each one highlights a different dimension. He never looks at the same object or human emotion in the same manner or in a traditional sense. Reading the collection of poetry  Maila Path Samanallu gives the reader the feeling of riding on one wave while also touching on bare naked human emotions.

TNA to support no-faith motion against MR
	
The Tamil National Alliance (TNA) today said it will vote in support of the No-Confidence Motion to be brought against the Government headed by Mahinda Rajapaksa.
In a statement, the TNA said Mr.Rajapaksas appointment as the Prime Minister was unconstitutional and illegal.
Remaining neutral in such a situation, would pave the way for achieving an undemocratic end by force, it said.
The TNA said according to the Constitution of Sri Lanka, the President does not possess the authority to remove a Prime Minister who is in office.
Such authority that vested in the President previously was specifically repealed by the 19th Amendment to the Constitution. In these circumstances the Gazette notification declaring that the Prime Minister had been removed and another Prime Minister appointed are unconstitutional and illegal, it said.
It said the TNA also considers the Presidents decision to prorogue Parliament as undemocratic and in violation of Parliamentary Supremacy.
After having declared as Prime Minister a Member who does not command the confidence of Parliament, this had been done in order to create delay and prevent such Member from having to prove a majority in Parliament. The TNA strongly condemns and opposes the undemocratic efforts to use such delay to bribe MPs with both money and Ministerial posts to induce them to cross over in order to fraudulently obtain a majority in Parliament. We strongly oppose and condemn TNA MP S. Viyalendran being a part of this conspiracy. Necessary action will be taken against him immediately, the party said.

## Title: Walls and fences should come down

Walls and fences should come down
	
At first I was a bit surprised to find that the English admonition, Good fences make good neighbours existed in many other languages. I shouldnt have been taken aback. A moments reflection should have told me that fences and walls to divide off peoples have been going on for millennia. Theres nothing in particular new about the fence between the US and Mexico, the Cold War wall between East and West Germany or the one between Israel and the Palestinian West Bank. Look at the Great Wall of China.
The Mexicans have a joke about the planned wall to replace the fence. Its not built to keep Mexicans out of the US; its built to keep Donald Trump out of Mexico!
Today, the Mexicans have a problem in that the migrant caravan made up of 6,000 fleeing Central Americans, is pouring into the South of Mexico where there is no fence. The Mexicans have reacted much more sensibly and humanely to the caravan, America-bound, than Trump. They are encouraging the caravaners to go no further and find work in Mexicos underdeveloped Southern states. Those applying for asylum have been offered temporary work permits with immediate effect.

Like Trump, right-wing politicians in Europe (including Brexit supporters in the UK) raise the spectre of endless migration. But its unlikely there will be more large-scale wars in the Middle East

The Mexicans know from their history that development is the cure for migration. Thanks to economic growth, the Mexican exodus to America has been reduced to a trickle. Trump doesnt talk about this. He goes on using the Mexicans as a scapegoat for a phenomenon that no longer exists.
In his election campaign he said, Theyre bringing crime. Theyre rapists. Now he is using the caravan to win votes in the coming mid-term elections. Ever since the Kissinger Commission that evaluated Central American needs at the end of the local civil wars in 1984, there has been talk of the need for the US to give significant amounts of aid to get these countries out of the rut of poverty. But not much has been forthcoming, though when it does arrive it often produces sterling results. I once was taken to a farm project in El Salvador run by the International Fund for Agricultural Development that was doing really well. This kind of aid is what Trump should concentrate on.
According to a new well-researched and perceptive book, The Age of Walls by Tim Marshall, each wall tells a story.
On Indias frontier with Bangladesh is the longest border fence in the world -- 2,500 miles of it. It was built primarily to stem the exodus of poorer Bangladesh is to better-off India. But now fast-developing Bangladesh is richer per head than India and the wall is becoming an anachronism.
India has another fence -- the 340-mile-long barrier along the disputed Line of Control inside Kashmir, a region both India and Pakistan say is their territory. It stands as a fortified monument to the enmity between two nuclear-armed nations, writes Marshall.

Thanks to economic growth, the Mexican exodus to America has been reduced to a trickle. Trump doesnt talk about this. He goes on using the Mexicans as a scapegoat for a phenomenon that no longer exists
Western Europe, belatedly, has joined the fence builders. The Syrian war migrant crisis of 2015 prompted a wave of nationalism, particularly in Eastern Europe. Rather than agree to burden-sharing which if it had been implanted would have given each EU country only a modest number of migrants each, these countries preferred to say no, taking in barely a handful. Hungary built fences along its border with Serbia and Croatia. Slovenia erected a fence along its border with Croatia, Macedonia along its Greek border, Austria along its border crossings with Slovenia and Italy.
The fences have insured that the Mediterranean countries where the refugees land have had to bear the most heavy load. Now the Syrian migration has been reduced to a trickle and African migration, except to Spain, has slowed dramatically, but still the fences remain.
Like Trump, right-wing politicians in Europe (including Brexit supporters in the UK) raise the spectre of endless migration. But its unlikely there will be more large-scale wars in the Middle East. Even the one remaining, Yemen, has produced few refugees Europe-bound.
The African stream is over-magnified. Observers talk about Africas population increase and how this must inevitably lead to more northward migration. But I wrote my first article about this in 1973 and it has been going on ever since in fairly modest numbers, even though the rate of population growth was much, much higher before than it is now. Theres still time to help Africa develop at a faster rate than its doing (much of it is doing rather well) and turn it into another Mexico where there are jobs and people prefer to stay at home. As for those migrants who do make it, most Western governments, too belatedly, have realised that their policy of multiculturalism has not worked. It has led to ghettoization. For immigration to have less bad effects it has to be carefully planned integration.
Fences and walls are not necessary. Mostly they are manifestations of superficial thinking.

President Maithripala Sirisena is reported to have told the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) Central Committee that he had the required number of MPs to form a stable government.
The SLFP CC with the President in the chair met on Wednesday for the first time after the swearing-in of the new Prime Minister.
The President asked the members to cooperate with him to form a stable government. The SLFP has decided to hold its executive committee and all island committee on November 8.
The all island committee is the body which ratifies the decisions taken by the CC.
The President said the SLFP constitution would be amended to incorporate two more provisions including the one to establish a politburo for decision making on crucial matters.
A party spokesman said the politburo would be a body parallel to the CC and that it would only consist of top level leaders. (Kelum Bandara)
