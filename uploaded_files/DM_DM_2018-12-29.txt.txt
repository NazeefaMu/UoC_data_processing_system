A.B Damunupola was a true public servant
	
Damunupola (Right) pictured with JRJ

At a time when politicians are calling on public officers to act according to the law, it reminds me of a Public Servant who discharged his duties in keeping with the law. He was non other than A.B.Damunupola who passed in 1988.
Damunupola was an Administrative Officer who served in different offices in the administrative sector. He was the Government Agent in the Central Province, a Special Commissioner in the Kandy Municipality, served as Post Master General and also in the capacity of Secretary to the Minister.
Damunupola was a student of St.Anthonys College, Katugastota and later graduated from the University of Peradeniya. He was also educated at Cambridge thanks to a scholarship offered to him by the Government on the merit of obtaining the highest marks at the CAS examination.

Damunupola had said that President Jayewardene without realising the consequences took over the land that was gifted to Mahanayake of the Asgiriya Chapter Pallipanne Chandananda

He did a Degree in economics at Cambridge. On his return he was at Anuradhapura as a Planning officer and continued to serve the Public sector until his demise in 1988.
He was public officer and would say No to a minister because he had no obligations to them.
I recall of an incident when a Senior Minister of State met the Late Damunupola at his office where I was present. The minister wanted him to withdraw a permit issued by him as the Government Agent. He refused. 

The Minister did and he was transferred within a few hours by not a lesser person than the President himself. Damunupola who left his seat wanted to resign from the public Service, but it was Minister E.L.Senanayake who advised him against resigning.
Damunupola was later appointed as Post Master General by Minister D.B.Wijetunge.
He was very well connected to President Jayewardene due to Udawattekelle where the President had an abiding interest. Yet Jayewardene was the very person to transfer Damunupola following the protest by the Senior Minister. Damunupola told me in his own style LB , he had to decide between taking the word of his Minister or that of a poor public servant like me. I do not blame him for that. But I as the Public Servant saved him from International shame.
Damunupola had said that President Jayewardene without realising the consequences took over the land that was gifted to Mahanayake of the Asgiriya Chapter Pallipanne Chandananda. The Thera was spearheading the campaign on behalf of Madama Sirimavo Bandaranaike against the  her civic right issue .
President Jayewardene did not realise then that the Crown Prince and Princess of Japan were due within the next three months and the prime event was to worship the Sacred Tooth Relic.
When he realised this the President had asked him as to who was having the key to the casket in which the Sacred Relic was kept. When he was told that the key to the Casket was with the Mahanayke of Asgiriya, he was silent for a few moments, during he telephone conversation. Then the President asked him whether he would come when the Crown Prince arrived at the Maligawa. He had said he would.
In fact, Damnupola said  I went to Asgiriya and checked with the arrangements for that day without telling the Thera that the President was jittery regarding the matter. The only thing that the Mahanayake said was that they are not safeguarding Jayewardene or any other Politician, but the Sangha was bound only to safeguard the Relic of The Buddha.The Thera added that it is their duty to allow the Prince and Princess to worship the Sacred Tooth Relic
This bit of information was conveyed to the President and he only said We will see.
When the day arrived the Mahanayakes were there and everything went well. When His Excellency was walking out of the gate behind the Prince and Princess, he had called Damunupola and said Give that land back.
There is much to be said about Damunupola. He was not only a Government Agent, but as a Special Commissioner of the Kandy Municipality.
Damunupola has a son (Arjuna) and daughter (Manori). Manori is married to the Basnayake Nilame Seevali Nugegoda.

Bangladesh slows internet ahead of election
	

DHAKA AFP Dec28, 2018- Bangladeshs authorities have severely restricted internet services across the country in an effort to fight ahead of Sundays general election, an official said. 
At the end of an election campaign marked by deadly violence, internet services were slowed across the country with 3G and 4G services suspended for several hours, a Bangladesh Telecommunications Regulatory Commission (BTRC) official said Friday. 
We asked telecom operators to halt 3G and 4G services temporarily on Thursday night. We have done it to prevent propaganda and misleading content spreading on the internet,the official told AFP on condition of anonymity. 
He said higher speed internet services resumed on Friday morning after a 10-hour blackout, but could be suspended again later in the day. 
Bangladesh will hold a parliamentary election on Sunday with Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina seeking a record fourth term in power. 
She is being challenged by an alliance led by the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) which says thousands of its activists have been arrested in a nationwide crackdown during the campaign. 
BNP leader Khaleda Zia was been jailed for 17 years on graft charges this year and the party says its candidates were attacked to prevent them from campaigning.

## Title: CIMOGG COMMITS HARA-KIRI
## Section: Opinion

CIMOGG COMMITS HARA-KIRI
	

The Citizens Movement for Good Governance (CIMOGG) decided recently to silence its own voice. What follows, for the purposes of record, is a brief summary of what CIMOGG endeavoured to do during the sixteen plus years of its existence. 
CIMOGG was formed in 2002 by a group of persons who had held high office in the public and private sectors. Even a listing of its better known members would be too long for a newspaper article but it may be mentioned that Walter Ladduwahetty (Secretary/Justice), James H. Lanerolle (Civil Servant) and Dr. Shelton Wanasinghe (Civil Servant) served as its Presidents. Among its Honorary Secretaries were General Gerry de Silva (Army Commander), Dr C.T. Jansz (Commissioner of Prisons) and W.B.A. Jayasekera (President, OPA). 
CIMOGG was probably the first organization to incorporate the term good governance in its name. In 2005, the full name of CIMOGG was translated into Sinhala as Yahapaalana Sandhahaavana Puravesi Vyaapaaraya and into Tamil as Nallaatchikkaana Prajaigal Munnani. 

Two basic principles of operation were agreed on . One was that CIMOGG would be politically independent and, therefore, free to criticize the government, the opposition or even the public. The second principle that was adopted was that CIMOGG should only be financed by voluntary, unsolicited contributions from its own members.
Two basic principles of operation were agreed on . One was that CIMOGG would be politically independent and, therefore, free to criticize the government, the opposition or even the public. The second principle that was adopted was that CIMOGG should only be financed by voluntary, unsolicited contributions from its own members. Factually, over the past 16 years, no extraneous local or foreign funding was received by CIMOGG other than small donations from fewer than a dozen well-wishers. 
CIMOGG started its programme of work, inter alia, with some Public Interest Litigation (PIL) initiatives handled pro deo by Attorney-at-Law Elmore Perera (EP), retired Surveyor- General. Among the more significant of the petitions filed was one in the Appeal Court (AC) against the then President Mahinda Rajapaksa (MR) for appointing AC judges without consulting the Constitutional Council (CC) and a second one in the Supreme Court (SC) against MR for appointing two SC judges, again without consulting the CC. The first one was dismissed by AC President K. Sripavan on the grounds that MR enjoyed blanket immunity, a position that we did not agree with even then. As for the SC petition, the story of how it was treated has been described in fair detail by the writer in a talk delivered to the Cancer Society on February 23, 2017 (www.cimogg-srilanka.org).

EPs work was brought to a harsh halt in 2006/2007 by the then Chief Justice Sarath N. Silva (SNS), who had issued a Rule on EP, in some other connection, for not being obedient to the Supreme Court. The highly respected H.L.de Silva PC prayed that the matter should be dealt with in accordance with the Supreme Courts current rules for disciplining Attorneys-at-Law. However, SNS insisted on following his own unwritten definitions and rules, and suspended EPs licence to appear in Court for a total period of eight years and 10 months. Following this development, CIMOGG was compelled to end its PIL efforts and, instead, try to build public opinion against poor governance and violations of the Rule of Law by concentrating on writing articles to the newspapers on allied subjects. 
It was only a few English-language newspapers that published CIMOGGs articles. Sinhala- language newspapers to which translations of the original English articles were taken by hand or sent by post were not willing to publish even one of them, apparently because of their fear of what the government of the time might do to them, as dozens of journalists and their families had learnt to their cost. No attempt was made by CIMOGG to get Tamil newspapers to publish its articles because it was credibly assumed that they would be even more afraid than their Sinhala counterparts as to what would happen to them if they crossed the then regime. 
Later, in 2012, CIMOGG went to some trouble and expense to publish in book form (Good Governance and the Rule of Law) a collection of its first 100 English language newspaper articles. Although the books were priced in the bookshops at much less than the cost of production, only a handful were sold. A few months later, a book containing about 110 translated articles in the Sinhala-language (Neethiya saha Yahapaalanaya Rajakaravamu) was also published but it attracted even less interest than the English original. 

During the last Presidential Election campaign, that the word Yahapaalanaya came into wide use to describe the kind of governance promised for the country by the group that was headed by the Venerable Maduluwawe Sobitha Thera.

In 2004/2005, CIMOGG had presented to the Dinesh Gunawardene Committee for Constitutional Reform the details of an electoral system that would empower citizens at the periphery, at the Centre, and those in-between, to play a significant role in governing their own areas. However, beyond giving the CIMOGG delegation a token hearing, the Committee did not show any further interest. Later, in 2015/2016, the Public Representations Committee on Constitutional Reforms collected public views but, instead of these being transparently accepted or rejected, six or so Parliamentary sub-committees were appointed to work in secrecy on various aspects of the Constitution. 
One may deduce that the above-mentioned circuses to ascertain the peoples views were really disguised public relations exercises intended to mislead citizens into thinking that their suggestions would be taken into account. Once the circuses had served their propaganda purposes, it was plain sailing to fashion a Constitution that would increase the power of Parliament and enhance the privileges and perquisites of MPs. Even though all MPs declare their unbounded love for Mother Lanka, their inputs to Constitution-writing have always been to include provisions that would effectively increase their direct and hidden earnings. 
CIMOGG consistently proposed that the most reliable way to improve governance would be for knowledgeable citizens to collectively work out a people-oriented Constitution from first principles such a Constitution would undoubtedly have fewer MPs but they would be much better qualified, with specialized knowledge and experience, and be committed to attending Parliament religiously. They would, of course, be paid generously and be expected to deliver value for money.  One of the primary objectives of a Constitution would be to create a clear Sri Lankan identity. To achieve this, the Constitution would have to be strictly secular and contain comprehensive provisions to encourage citizens to think as Sri Lankans first. Needless to say, politicians who win seats by playing the race card and religious card will fight tooth and nail against such a positive Constitution. CIMOGG; therefore, drafted a Constitution on its own incorporating a few new concepts but the difficulty most people have in thinking outside the box has prevented it from being considered in depth. 
Having been forced, in recent years, to come to the conclusion that the majority of adult Sri Lankans are mentally lazy and unwilling to make any serious effort to work for better governance, CIMOGG decided that, in the long-term at least, it would be more rewarding for Sri Lankas future to inculcate concepts of good social responsibility in children of various age groups, from five years upwards. Efforts were made to try to get at least one TV station to include messages, cartoons and stories into existing childrens programmes so as to promote behaviour that would make at least the next generation of citizens more responsible and less destructive than the present one. However, the few experts that CIMOGG consulted regarding this project asserted quite emphatically that our TV media (including the State-owned ones) are interested only in programmes that will earn money for them and would do nothing in the public interest. Hence, this proposal had to be put on the back shelf. 
It is necessary to recall that it was only in the latter half of 2014, during the last Presidential Election campaign, that the word Yahapaalanaya came into wide use to describe the kind of governance promised for the country by the group that was headed by the Venerable Maduluwawe Sobitha Thera. Over the past four years, there have been a few important gains - enhanced media freedom, the abandonment of the white van culture, the Right to Information Act, the (much-criticised) 19th Amendment and, above all, the liberation of the judiciary from most of the unhealthy pressures imposed on it earlier. 
Looking at the negatives, among the worst achievements of Maithripala Sirisena (MS) were his sacking of Ms Dilrukshie Wickremasinghe from the CIABOC where she was doing a very impressive job. He went on a lot of expensive tours abroad with family and friends that did not, to our knowledge, bring any economic benefits to Sri Lanka. He dissolved the rightful government unconstitutionally on October 26, and continued with many acts that have done immense harm to Sri Lanka economically and have gravely injured its international standing. Moreover, with the Police under his wing, all investigations regarding certain big crimes committed prior to 2015 seem to have been put on hold. 
As for Ranil Wickremesinghe (RW), he cannot pretend that he did nothing wrong in appointing a non-national to be the Governor of the Central Bank by referring to the appointment of John Exter as the first Governor. He cannot remain silent on why he did not ask for the resignation of Arjuna Mahendran (AM) even after many credible accusations were made against AM. Whilst Ravi Karunanayake (RK) is credited with having financed the UNP very heavily and having the pull to get huge crowds of supporters together, the unpalatable fact is that he suffers from so incredible a loss of memory about his financial affairs that no fair-minded citizen will believe in the truth of anything he says, which is hardly a good position for any public figure to be in. As a consequence of RW trying to repay RK, his own standing in the publics eye has been affected very adversely without in any way enhancing RKs. Furthermore, RW is held in low regard by many citizens because of his inability to retire the loyal old UNPers and introduce the young, dynamic blood that the public want to see in charge of important-Ministries. His dilemma is to show his gratitude to those who have helped him without making them part of his Ministerial team. If RK and the older UNPers would think of the country first and graciously make way for younger party members, public faith in the UNP has every chance of being restored to a higher level. 
The people have been particularly disillusioned because both MS and RW have failed to deliver on the promises made by them in the name of the Yahapaalanaya, especially the firm undertakings to get rid of the abominable Executive Presidency, the dangers of which came to be highlighted so frighteningly on October 26. The investigation and prosecution of crimes of corruption, waste on a gigantic scale, barefaced robbery, nepotism, arson, violence of every kind, kidnapping and murder committed by their political rivals appear to have been deliberately slowed down for fairly obvious reasons. In short, those who voted for MS and, by implication, for RW, in January 2015 have been greatly disappointed. Although these two leaders have done some good things, their attachment to Yahapaalanaya has proved to be minimal. Unfortunately, CIMOGG has got a bad name for no reason other than that many people are under the impression that CIMOGG is an adjunct of the MS-RW government! It also became progressively clear that CIMOGGs failure to make a conspicuous impact to secure good governance resulted in its own members becoming discouraged to the point of withdrawing from regular participation in its activities. In the light of these facts, the only option left to CIMOGG was self-obliteration, a painful decision that it decided to take on December 19.

Defeat extremism, abolish executive presidency: Speaker
	
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya has urged all concerned citizens to work towards defeating extremism and the abolishing of the executive presidency in the New Year.
He said this at an inter-religious congress held at his official residence on Wednesday.
It seems that religious and ethnic extremism has raised its head again. This seems to have been shaped by politics. It is important that the inter-religious congress takes steps to arrest this trend, the Speaker said. Dont let politicians spread extremism using temples and other places of worship."
He requested the inter-religious congress to work towards abolishing the executive presidency which is not good for democracy.
I have been backing the abolition of the executive presidency and I dedicated myself to the abolishing of the executive presidency after the famous North-Western Province elections in 1999.
The Inter-Religious congress requested the Speaker to bringing about a truce between the President and the Prime Minister to ensure that there was stability in the country.

Do unto others what you wish them to do unto you
	
We live in a world where we often see a negative picture of how political and other leaders have worked with hidden agendas to create a monstrosity where 10% of the super billionaires own more wealth than 90% of the population. But it is inspiring to hear of individuals who work hard and without much publicity to bring about poverty alleviation, helping in the battle against global warming and provide well-paid jobs for
marginalized youth. 
The Cable News Network (CNN) recently chose 10 remarkable trailblazers who have truly changed the world. One of the heroes is Abisoye Ajayi-Akinfolarin who left her career to teach computer programming to girls at Lagos in Nigeria where Facebook and Google opened offices earlier this year. A 2013 survey found that less than 8% of Nigerian women were employed in professional, managerial or technological jobs. Abisoye hopes to change that statistic. 
Another heroine is Maria Rose Belding who wants to help feed the millions of Americans who dont regularly have enough. She connects them with the massive amounts of food that goes waste -- estimated at up to 40%. She teamed up with a fellow student to develop a free online platform called MEANS, which puts businesses that have extra food in touch with movements that feed the hungry. 
The other heroine is Amanda Boxtel who helps the injured walk again. Amanda survived a horrific skiing accident and doctors told her she would never walk again. She defied those expectations with the help of machines called bionic exoskeleton suits, which inspired Amanda to create Bridging Bionics. 
Another hero is Rob Gore, whose mission is breaking the cycle of violence. As a hospital ER physician at Brooklyn in New York, Dr. Gore saw the results of violence all too closely. So in 2009, he and a few volunteers started the Kings Against Violence Initiative (KAVI) which works with at-risk high school students, teaching them mediation andconflict resolution. 
The other hero is Luke Mickelson who makes a place for children to sleep safely. In 2012, he was shocked to learn that there were needy children in his town of Twin Falls in Idaho. The children were forced to sleep on the floor because they had no beds. Using safety guidelines and his daughters bunk bed as a template, Mr Mickelson started using his own money to buy wood and supplies to build beds for these children. He recruited friends and family membersto help. 
The other heroine is Susan Munsey, who rescues victims of the sex trade. As a teen, Susan was lured into a life of prostitution in Southern California, where she learned about the abuse of young women firsthand. Eventually she was able to escape that world to become a clinical social worker and a psychotherapist. In 2009, she founded GenerateHope, a nonprofit movement that offers a safe place for survivors of
sex trafficking. 
The other heroine is Florence Phillips who teaches Americas newcomers. She served for years in Kenya, Guatemala and Jamaica, working on community-building projects and teaching English. When she returned to the US she eventually settled at Carson City in Nevada, where immigrants make up about 20% of the states population. 
Another heroine is Ellen Stackable who heals women inmates. While working on her graduate school thesis, she was surprised to learn her home state of Oklahoma has the highest rate of female incarceration in America. She found that many women inmates were first-time, non-violent offenders. She listened to their stories and began to understand their difficult lives. 
The other hero is Chris Stout who champions military veterans in need. When US Army combat veteran Chris Stout returned from Afghanistan to Kansas City in Missouri, he struggled with an injury and PTSD. He was frustrated by the gaps and inefficiencies he saw. He also saw homeless veterans living on the street because they felt traditional homeless shelters were unsafe or lacked privacy. 
Finally the hero of the year is Ricardo-Pun Chong who comforts sick children and their families. He spent a lot of time making rounds at hospitals throughout Lima in Peru. Day after day, he noticed families sleeping on the floors. Far from home and loved ones, and unable to pay for a place to stay in Lima, many families found themselves homeless while fighting for their childrens lives. He decided to do something for them. Since 2008, Ricardos nonprofit, Inspira, has provided free housing, meals and overall support for sick children and their families while they
undergo treatment. 
We also need to ponder on how we could make this world a better place to live in. What we need is a good vision and goals, enterprise, creativity and an innovative spirit to forget the selfish politicians or other leaders and make this world a better place by doing unto others what we wish they would dounto us.

Finally,elections in the Congo
	

The general election has been postponed yet again. Will this country, the largest and potentially the richest in Africa, ever escape from its continuous dictatorship, and its propensity to civil war Its not so long ago that Susan Rice, the then US Ambassador to the United Nations, was talking about the Congo as the site of Africas First World War. Has the UN at long last really pacified this country that has been continuously in a state of unrest since the Belgian colonisers, after effectively looting the country, fled in 1960, turning the country over to a hastily improvised African government 
Today we can say that the fighting that has consumed the Congo is within sight of being over, apart from some localized violence in Kivus and Kasai provinces. But, given the history of the most turbulent of all African countries, we should say, lets wait and see. Nevertheless, it is encouraging to know that the UNs largest peacekeeping operation ever has met with this degree of success.

The results of this UN activism are impressive. Most of the country is quiet. The mining and agricultural sectors are recovering well. Hyperinflation has been tamed and the exchange rate remains stable. Mobile phone masts have been installed even where the roads have all but disappeared. Foreign investment is returning

This second UN intervention in the Congo appeared to be more successful than the first, back in 1960 when, fearful of the US and the Soviet Union competing to gain a foothold in Africa, Secretary-General Dag Hammarskjold, pushed for UN intervention, as the countrys post-independence civil war appeared to spin out of control. The UN did pacify the country to some degree -- at the cost of claiming Hammarskjolds life in a supposed accident of his plane- but it left with its tail between its legs, handing the country over to 32 years of decadent and cruel rule by the masterful dictator, Mobutu Sese Seko. 
For once in recent times the UN presence has been funded reasonably well, with the US the major contributor. Not least, unlike the first time, it had a unanimous Security Council mandate behind it, involving Chapter 7 of the Charter, which bestows the right to use military force. 
The results of this UN activism are impressive. Most of the country is quiet. The mining and agricultural sectors are recovering well. Hyperinflation has been tamed and the exchange rate remains stable. Mobile phone masts have been installed even where the roads have all but disappeared. Foreign investment is returning. 
All in all this has not been an easy nor an inexpensive UN operation nor one that has always run smoothly, as the serious allegations of rape made against some UN contingents attest. The UN operation has cost $1 billion a year to run. The general election in 2006 cost the international community half a billion dollars. Seeing the good work of past years coming undone, the Security Council authorized a peacekeeping brigade consisting of Malawians, South Africans and Tanzanians and were given an aggressive mandate to defeat M23 in Kivu. 

Today we can say that the fighting that has consumed the Congo is within sight of being over, apart from some localized violence in Kivus and Kasai provinces. But, given the history of the most turbulent of all African countries, we should say, lets wait and see. Nevertheless, it is encouraging to know that the UNs largest peacekeeping operation ever has met with this degree of success

Yes, the financial cost is high but it is much less than what has been spent in Iraq and Afghanistan and the results more favourable. Indeed, one can plausibly argue that before the Western intervention in Iraq and Afghanistan, the Congo was the country of the three in the greater mess, with the most violence. Now it is the one with the least. 
After the 2006 election it looked as if peace had finally arrived. But it didnt. One of the main belligerents, the Congolese Rally for Democracy, Rwandas ally, did badly in the election and went from controlling one third of the country to securing only 3% representation in parliament. Not surprisingly, a number of its leaders went back to war. Fighting in the eastern Kivu province flared up. Now it is rather less. 
Unfortunately, in the ensuing years the UNs most active backers, the US and EU, took their eyes off the ball. Once the 2006 election was over interest in the Congo among top Westernleaders dissipated. 
Now they are being forced by events to focus again. Congos young ruler, Joseph Kabila, while stabilizing most of the country, has allowed massive corruption and manoeuvered to stay in power indefinitely. The constitution doesnt allow it. There has been serious unrest especially in the capital. The Catholic bishops intervened as arbitrators, and that helped. At last there is going to be an election.

Of course, as the saying goes, It is never over until the fat lady sings. Thats for sure in the Congo.

Government shutdown will go into 2019
	

The government shutdown will not be lifted before the New Year after the Senate graveled out of session until next week and Republican House leaders told members there would be no votes on Friday. 
Republican Sen. Pat Roberts graveled the upper chamber into session for 4 minutes Thursday, on day six of the shutdown and announced it will not be back in for a formal session until Wednesday of next week. 
The House graveled into session for 3 1/2 minuteson Thursday. 
The Senate and House will both be in session Monday for a pro forma meeting but no business or votes are expected to be conducted in yet another sign the shutdown will drag on. Both chambers have promised lawmakers at least 24 hours notice before any votes are to be held in order to give them time to get to the Capitol. 
While the House was in session Thursday afternoon, Democratic Rep. Jim McGovern tried to bring up a bill to reopen the government. He shouted to try to be recognized but Republican Rep. Luke Messer - who was presiding over the chamber - ignored him and graveled the House out of session. 
McGovern told reporters afterward there was an agreement to fund the government in place last week: Until the president, you know, went off his meds, and who the hell knows what happened. 
Earlier in the day, House Republican Whip Steve Scalises office advised lawmakers there would be no votes this week.

Mannar Mass Grave Site - Financial assistance from OMP
	
The Office on Missing Persons (OMP), which assisted the investigation into the human remains at the Mannar mass grave site, said that it would provide financial assistance to carry out carbon dating of the skeletal remains as part of its continued support to the investigation.
From December 18 to 20, the OMP observed the process of selecting six bone samples for radio carbon dating at the Mannar mass grave, located near the Sathosa Building in Mannar.
In a statement, the OMP said yesterday the samples from the Mannar mass grave site will be sent to a laboratory abroad which specializes in bomb pulse carbon-14 technique.
In cases where the skeletons belonged to persons who died after World War II, bomb pulse carbon-14 dating can provide a narrower range of time periods in which the deaths occurred. Six samples were selected to represent the different areas and vertical layers of the site. Human remains had been excavated from the site as complete skeletons and as commingled bones. From complete skeletons, a tooth and a section of the femur bone was selected. From the commingled bones only the femur or where it was unavailable a tooth. The samples were extracted, cleaned, dried, sealed and labelled over the course of three days. Following the samples being tested at a laboratory and the results being submitted, a preliminary combined excavation report including the test results and other findings will be submitted by the investigation team to the Magistrate Court, it said.
The process of selecting samples was carried out in the presence of Mannar Magistrate T. Saravanaraja. The team carrying out the sample selection included representatives from the Consultant Judicial Medical Officers, the Post Graduate Institute of Archaeology from the University of Kelaniya, the Police and the Government Analysts Department. OMP Commissioners Mr. Mirak Raheem and Mr. K. Venthan were present as observers. Lawyers representing families of the disappeared and a member from the Citizens Committee were also present as observers.
Consultant Judicial Medical Officer, District General Hospital Mannar, Dr. S. Rajapaksha said that after 118 working days they have unearthed 278 skeletons, which includes remains of men, women and children.
There is some damage to the bones, but it is only upon further investigation that we can determine if these are ante-mortem or postmortem injuries, and whether it relates to the cause of death. Our task has been to gather evidence to determine the cause of death, time since death, the contributing circumstances and the specific identity of the individuals in this site, and also determine if all the skeletons are from the same historical period or different periods, while ensuring the integrity of the site and chain of custody of remains and other evidence. Dr. Rajapaksha heads the investigation team and is assisted by Professor Raj Somadeva who leads the archaeological team.
Prior to the sampling process, the OMP recommended guidelines for selecting and recording the samples and the OMP recommended measures to secure the chain of custody of samples.
OMP Chairperson Saliya Pieris said the OMP remains committed to establishing the truth about circumstances in which persons went missing and their fate. It is imperative for the OMP to assist the investigation of the remains excavated at the Mannar mass grave, he said.
The OMPs application to act as an observer was accepted by the Honourable Mannar Magistrate on 4th June 2018, and it has been observing the process of excavation since.
Since July 2018, the OMP has been supporting the costs of food and lodging of the excavation team and provided additional funds for covers to protect the grave site from the monsoon rain.
We have sought to impress on the authorities the need to maintain high standards and ensure public confidence and trust in the investigation process, Mr. Pieris said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Ministerial portfolio - Why have I been overlooked: Wijemanne
	
UNP Kalutara District MP Lakshman Wijemanne said yesterday said he would take a serious political decision if he was not given a ministerial portfolio.
He said it was unfair for UNPers like himself not to be given a ministerial portfolio. We have never left the party at times of trouble and defended both the party and the leadership and therefore it is unfair not to be given a ministry, he told Daily Mirror.
Ministerial portfolios have been given to some who are junior to me. I asked the party leadership why they were given ministries leaving me out. They said it was done based on their performance. I dont understand what was meant by performance as those who were appointed as ministers have shouted in Parliament while I have managed to bring in more votes than they have done. I have been with the UNP from the time of President J. R. Jayewardene." he added.
The MP said he would take a political decision which will be felt by the whole world. However, I am not going to reveal what I am going to do just yet, he said.
Mr. Wijemanne was the second UNP MP to demand a ministerial portfolio while former Minister Palitha Range Bandara also expressed his displeasure at being overlooked. (Yohan Perera)

School uniforms vouchers : Action against principals who promote businesses: Akila Viraj
	
The Education Ministry said yesterday disciplinary action would be taken against principals who were trying to promote certain businesses when giving out free vouchers to purchase school uniforms.
Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam said the ministry had received complaints that certain principals were engaged in this unethical practice when distributing free vouchers to students for uniforms for the new year.
The minister instructed all the principals to adhere to the 41/2018 circular without attempting to influence from where parents should go to when purchasing school uniforms for their children.
He said the voucher system was introduced to prevent malpractices reported in the past when distributing free school uniforms.
The ministry secretary in a letter sent to principals and other officials said that the children should be allowed to purchase uniforms from the place/ outlet of their choice.
The letter added that no education official should mediate directly or indirectly in the act of purchasing school uniforms. (Ajith Siriwardana)

## Title: Sripada pilgrim season begins

Sripada pilgrim season begins
	

Sripada, also known as Samanala Kanda (which is at a height of 2293 metres) is the third highest mountain in Sri Lanka. Buddhists believe that Gautama Buddha placed his footprint on this peak. Sripada is a popular tourist attraction. Foreigners call this place Adams peak and believe that the foot print placed on the mountain is that of Adams or St. Thomas. Hindus claim it to be the foot print of God Siva and call it Sivanadipadam. Hence, a large number of devotees embracing different religions climb the mountain annually during the season; which is from Duruthu Full moon poya day to Vesak Full moon poya day the following year. In laymens language this season starts in December and concludes in May. Devotees regard the rest of the year as the off-season. It is believed that the off-season is set aside for celestial beings, especially to God Sumana Saman whose abode is believed to be located on this mountain peak.

Rich in biodiversity
Sripada is virtually surrounded by forest and hills. These mountains which are in the vicinity are not as tall as Sripada. The area covering the Horton Plains national park and the Knuckles Range in the central highlands was recognised as a world heritage site in the year 2011. Sripada is also important as a watershed. Four main rivers of Sri Lanka, Mahaweli, Kelani, Kalu and Walawe originate from Sripada. The area to the south and east of this mountain yields precious stones-emeralds, rubies and sapphires for which the island is famous for. This area is known as Ratnapura.

Buddhas second visit to Sri Lanka 
When Gautama Buddha visited Sri Lanka for the second time to settle a dispute among Nagas led by Chulodara and Mahodara, the ruler of the Kelaniya kingdom, Naga King Maniakkhika, who had gone there to listen to Dharma from the Enlightened One invited The Buddha to visit his kingdom, Kelaniya. The Enlightened One accepted the invitation and during the eighth year after the Enlightenment he visited Sri Lanka for the third occasion. On this occasion God Sumana Saman extended an invitation to the Buddha to visit his abode at Samanala Kanda in the Central hills of Sri Lanka. According to Mahavamsa, Gautama Buddha had proceeded to Samantha kuta from Kelaniya with super natural powers through the air. It is believed that this mountain is protected by God Sumana Saman. Devotees too are protected by him. 

History 
Sripada is first referred to as Samanthakuta in Deepawansa during the fourth century and in Mahawansa in the fifth century. A mention is made in Mahawansa that King Valagamba had taken refuge in the forest of Sripada. King Vijayaba had visited Sripada during the fourth century. Italian traveler, Marco Polo noted that Sripada was an important place although he had not mentioned of the foot print. People from all walks of life climb Sripada to worship the sacred foot print and also for enjoy the hike.

Pilgrimage season 
Pilgrims climb this mountain only during the season. pilgrims avoid climbing the mountain during the off-season due to adverse weather conditions. The off-season makes travelling difficult for the pilgrim because of rain, wind and falling snow.

Start of the season
It takes about five hours to climb the mountain by foot. The mount is located in the Southern reaches of the central Highlands in the Ratnapura district of the Sabaragamuwa province and the Nuwara Eliya district of the Central Province. On Unduvap Poya Day the image of God Sumana Saman is taken in procession to the top of the Adams peak from Galpottawa Sripadasthna Viharaya and kept there till the end on the Vesak Full moon poya day. During the whole of the off-season the image of this deity is housed at Galpottawa Viharaya. Hence this temple is called Sripada pansala. Since this temple was constructed by King Keerthi Sri Rajasinghe it is also called Keerthi Sri Rajasinghe Raja Maha Viharaya. 
During the season hundreds of thousands of devotees (Both local and foreign) climb the mountain in their attempts to do merit. Devotees and tourists enjoy the hike in spite of the fact that it is a tedious excursion. To endure the tiredness and fatigue they rest on the way from time to time together in groups, bathe and clean themselves at Seethagangula, share refreshments including eats like aggala.

Sama chathya 
On their way to the peak after passing Seethagangula, pilgrims find Sama Chathya; the peace pagoda. This stupa was built by the famous Buddhist monk, Ven. Nichi Fugi in 1976. Today it is maintained by several Buddhist monks. 

Samanala Kanda 
Samanalaya is the butterfly in Sinhalese. During a certain season of the year butterflies fly towards this mountain in great numbers. Hence Sripada is also called Samanala kanda. It is believed that butterflies too have the habit of going on pilgrimage to Sripada. 

Pad Piyum, Pada Padma and Pa Kamal
There are many foot prints of the Buddha painted or engraved by painters and sculptors. In Sripada it is like a lotus flower and hence it is called Pa Piyum, Pada Padma and Pa Kamal meaning foot of lotus. Buddhas feet were different from those of celestial beings and human beings as He is the Eminent One. 

Thirty two marks in the body 
Since The Buddha is the Exalted One, the Eminent One without a superior, it is said that there are thirty two auspicious marks on His body- Detis Maha Purusha Lakshana. These marks are there to indicate that The Buddha is Devathi Deva (god of gods) and Brahmati Brahma (Brahma of Brahmas.)

Naraseeha Gatha 
There is a belief that there are one hundred eight auspicious marks on Buddhas feet. Mention is made of some of them in Naraseeha Gatha; said to have been recited by Queen Yasodhara to describe the personality of the Enlightened One to her son, Prince Rahula. 

Mangala Lakuna
Auspicious marks in the Siripathula or Buddhas feet are described in the book titled Mangala Lakuna which is used in temple education. According to this book and another book titled Himagata Vannana there are twenty four auspicious marks on Buddhas feet. Mention is made about the marks on Buddhas feet by the venerable Professor, Bellanwila Wimalagnana Thera in his books titled Budu pilimaya Mudra saha Asana and Buddha Maha Purusha Sankalpaya. These auspicious marks are found only on the body of the Exalted One- The Buddha who is passionless and free from desires. 
According to Mahawansa The Buddha had placed His foot print at Yonakapura. Professor Gunapala Malalasekera is of the opinion that Yonakapura, mentioned in Pali books is Ayodya, was a country under the rule of Greeks somewhere during the eleventh century B.C. It was supposed to be a country situated near Afghanistan. A Buddha statue which is supposed to be the tallest in the world and found in a mountain range near Afghanistan substantiates this view.

Dolos Maha Pahana
Dolos Maha Pahana is the coconut oil lamp lit at Sripada. It is called so because it is kept burning throughout the twelve months of the year. The lamp continues to light regardless of whether devotees avoid climbing the mountain during the off-season. During the off-season there are people both clergy and laymen to attend to the rites including the need to keep the oil lamp burning.

Sunrise and shadow of the mount 
When the sun is just about to rise the pilgrims and tourists rush to the eastern side to watch an amazing spectacle. The sun almost leaps over to the eastern horizon giving rise to a shadow which takes the form of a perfect triangle which represents the mountain. As the sun keeps on rising the shadow shifts towards the base of the mountain until it completely disappears. This is a breath breaking scene.

UN experts raise alarm over Indian citizens register
	

GENEVA AFP Dec27, 2018 - Three United Nations human rights experts expressed deep concern Thursday over a controversial citizens register in Indias Assam state, warning it could inflame ethnic tensions in an already fractious region. 
A new draft Register of Citizens (NRC) in the northeastern state announced in July left off four million people, leaving them potentially stateless and facing an uncertain future. 
Critics say it is the latest move by the right-wing party of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to bolster Indias Hindu majority at the expense of minorities. India will hold a national electionnext year. 
The policy was introduced by the state government, which is controlled by the same BJP party in power nationally. 
We are... seriously concerned about the lack of clarity regarding what will happen to those left out of the finalised NRC, said a joint statement from the UN special rapporteur on religious freedoms, Ahmed Shaheed, the rapporteur for minority rights, Fernand de Varennes and an expert on arbitrary detentions, Seong-Phil Hong. There is a risk that persons not part of the NRC could become stateless, be at risk of deportation, or be subject to large-scale migration detention, they said. 
The deadline to provide the necessary documents to be included on the register has been set for December 31.

## Title: WHAT THE PROFESSIONALS FORGET

WHAT THE PROFESSIONALS FORGET
	

Different people have different ideas regarding whats ailing Sri Lanka. For some it is the education system. For others it is the cost of living. For still others it is the balance of payments deficit. Regardless of the problem, all of them are agreed on the reason behind it. The political system. That is why editors, commentators, and activists tend to single out politicians. They are, as they always were, responsible for this countrys downfall. Without them, so the saying goes, we would prosper.
The antipathy towards politicians isnt new, of course. Nor is it limited to Sri Lanka. And to be fair, it isnt unjustifiable. The cost of holding a session in Parliament is Rs. 25.7 million (according to Rohana Hettiarachchi of the March 12th Movement). Given that there were around three sessions held by the previous government in which nothing substantive was discussed (barring those chairs thrown about), that works out to Rs. 75 million, assuming of course that the cost of a session is fixed regardless of duration. As far as censure and critique go, our politicians are truly deserving of the sobriquets theyve earned from the people.
What of the alternatives Two years ago Professor Hector Perera argued that eradication of corruption would require a mammoth collective effort on the part of the media, independent citizens, and professionals. Only they could save the country, provided they themselves were free of corruption and upheld the standards of good governance their professions had codified. That last point was interesting, because on it rested the myth of the honest professional class.

In the popular consciousness, the independent civil society, inclusive of the media, is seen to be for good governance, democracy, and everything thats decent in politics.

In the popular consciousness, the independent civil society, inclusive of the media, is seen to be for good governance, democracy, and everything thats decent in politics. Their response to the previous government showed where their loyalties lay in this regard. Among the statements they issued, I remember one by a middle aged, near retirement professional. Heres the gist of what he said:
Mr Sirisena, we have tolerated your behaviour long enough. If you continue to populate the parliament with uneducated thugs and kasippu dealers, we will not pay our taxes. That is our ultimatum and we stand by it today!
The irony was, of course, that while threatening non payment of taxes he was calling for the return of the same government that had imposed tax after tax on a multitude of people who couldnt and cant afford three meals a day. Hows that for talking shop about democracy and good governance, eh
Professionals are more often than not seen as squeaky clean individuals. At one level, this is a little hypocritical. Have there not been cases of doctors overcharging patients and obtaining bribes from pharmaceutical companies Have there not been cases of civil society activists obtaining largesse from state corporations Have there not been cases of middle class professionals bribing officials to get their business plans passed If so, how can we repose any trust in them How can they be considered the superiors of the politicians who are, for all their faults, elected by the people through the only system we have that holds them accountable to us: the franchise
Someone told me that it was the middle class who were behind the tax revolutions of the 18th and 19th centuries, in particular the French and the American Revolutions. Perhaps, but not because they were democrats: from the time of Oliver Cromwells dislodgement of the monarchy in England, Europe was engaged with a battle between the feudal aristocracy and the emerging bourgeoisie/merchant class. The bourgeoisie were less concerned with democracy than they were with obtaining privileges in the form of political representation for themselves. In fact upon coming to power, they did all they could to take the franchise away from the working class and exploit to the hilt that same working class. The middle class, so beloved today, was never moved by benevolent intentions. They merely wanted to enrich themselves.
Not even the Founding Fathers of the United States or their cohorts, whom lawyers and judges and democracy activists quote extensively today when they give judgments and pronouncements against corruption, were preoccupied with democracy. Alexander Hamilton called for it to be curbed; James Murray Mason warned against becoming too enamoured of it; Jeremy Belknap argued that the people werent fit to govern themselves. From Locke to Rousseau, from Rousseau to Arendt, the thread that runs through Western liberalism is that democracy does not really mean letting the people govern themselves. It was at once for the people and against the people.
Where did the professionals fit in here In feudal Europe, artisans were dependent on the State for patronage. Without that patronage Mozart wouldnt have become Mozart. In this sense, they were the transmitting mechanisms for an aristocratic worldview, though as artists they may not have considered themselves as such.
Then the bourgeois revolutions struck with the Industrial Revolution, of which, Dwight Macdonald tells us in Masscult and Midcult, [t]he important change was the replacement of the individual patron by the market. The professions  from medicine to law to the arts  were disrupted, but they served the same purpose: to transmit to the masses, in a language intelligible to the masses, the worldview of the new aristocracy: not the landed gentry, but the factory owners.
It is from this premise that Louis Althusser pointed out at the school, the judiciary, and the family institution, venerated by democrats of today, as ideological state apparatuses. A careful reading of Marxs Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte can dispel the notion that most if not all of these symbols of an apolitical democratic society  the independence of the judiciary, the sanctity of the Constitution, and the supremacy of the Parliament  challenge power structures. Far from it. The professions in that sense were hawul karayo: they were collaborationists, and in that act of collaboration they ended up perpetuating a class ridden bourgeois dominated society.
Perhaps it comes to no surprise, then, that those calling for a middle class revolution here are against granting the poor constitutional concessions in the form of economic, social, and cultural (ESC) rights. Its democracy for the nouveau riche, for the nascent bourgeoisie, but not for those who can benefit the most from a democratic revolution. Its good governance for those who can govern themselves only; that is, the merchant, executive, consumer, professional class of Colombo.
Since 2014 there has been a consciousness raising exercise to get people to vote for intellectuals and meritocrats. In this scheme of things, the uneducated rowdies you see in parliament should get out or be kicked out. Most of those opposed to these rowdies come from Colombo, and the society they idealise is based on the world they occupy: free of cultural constraints, lacking cultural roots, indifferent to the voting underclass, and unaware of realities outside the urban centre.
Obviously, theres a problem here. So if we are to come up with a replacement for the political party system we have, the best bet we can come up with must be better than the middle class, who are, as they themselves know, hardly innocent of the crimes they now attribute to those same rowdy-like politicians.
Here we can ask a question. Now that Ranil Wickremesinghe is back in his saddle, and now that he has, contrary to representations made by those who vouched for him, brought back members of his Royalist Regency, where are all those activists Those professionals Their silence is deafening. Disturbing. So deafening and disturbing, in fact, that I fail to understand what they were fighting for in the first place.
We are looking up the wrong tree. The political system isnt whats ailing us. Nor is it the people. Its those who are arguing that the political system needs to be revamped. Its those who turned the other side when calls were made for a broad coalition to end the war, and suddenly in 2014 woke up to the need for such a coalition solely for the purpose of ousting the political parvenu, Mahinda Rajapaksa.
They forget that economics was once called political economy, they forget that the root of all our problems is the fact that we have failed to get our economy going, and they forget that the political class they support happens to be the reason behind our lagging economy. If this is the kind of people we have to entrust our government to, the kind of people we should hand our public services, from education to healthcare, to, Id rather vote for the uneducated peasant, who at least knows the value of those services, and the battles that had to be waged against the ruling class to make them available to the larger public, to you and to me.
