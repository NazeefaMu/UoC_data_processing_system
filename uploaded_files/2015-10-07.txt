	The Bench comprising Chief Justice K.Sripavan, Justices Priyantha Jayawardane and Upali Abeyratne fixed the matter to be taken up on January 28 next year.

Reject UNHRC resolution: Somawansa
	
Janatha Sevaka Pakshaya General Secretary Somawansa Amarasinghe today said all the political parties should come together to reject the UNHRC resolution in order to prevent Sri Lanka from becoming a colony again.
Addressing a news conference, the former Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna Leader said the proposed all party convention to study the UNHRC report on Sri Lanka was similar to shutting the stable door after the horses have bolted.
?An all-party convention could have been held prior to co-sponsoring a resolution with the US on Sri Lanka at the UNHRC. Now there?s no point of holding a convention over something which had already happened,? he said.
Mr. Amarasinghe said that no international organisations, not even the UNHRC has a right to intervene into the internal affairs of a particular country and said it could only offer to provide assistance to countries in developing human rights.
He refuted the reports that the mechanism to probe war crime charges was entirely being domestic and said it would be a hybrid mechanism with the input of foreign judges.
?This is a clear threat to our sovereignty and integrity as we are capable of conducting a domestic probe. The US, motivated by separatists, only wants to reap certain benefits from bringing the resolution. If this resolution was implemented, it will be a victory to the separatist elements,? he said.
He said it was absurd for a country like the US which had committed many human rights violations in countries like Afghanistan, to preach other countries on improving human rights.
Mr. Amarasinghe further said a new constitution will be required to make room for a hybrid court and said already certain measures are being taken to alter the judicial system of the country. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

The Presidential Secretariat in a communiqu? on reports regarding the Rs.180 million requested to repair the new President?s residence said the building had to be renovated by merging two old houses so as to be made suitable for the use of a President.

The Presidential Secretariat said President Maithripala Sirisena had refused to use the President?s House in Fort because of the exorbitant cost of maintenance and added that it would have cost the State coffers Rs.15 million for water, electricity and maintenance in the event that building was used for residential purposes per month.
Referring to the BMW cars and motorcycles, which were mentioned in today?s newspapers, it said those vehicles had been purchased by the previous government.
The Presidential Secretariat said the BMW cars had arrived in the Colombo Port on January 8 while the BMW motorcycles had arrived on February 21 and that they were taken over by the government because the vehicles could not be re-exported and the freight charges themselves would have been huge.The Full Statement
