Mosquito bites: Suitable clothes to protect students
	
The Education Ministry is contemplating issuing a circular which allows students in high risk dengue areas to dress in clothing that would protect them from mosquito bites.
Addressing the media Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam said today the temporary decision would be made to minimize students falling prey to the dengue epidemic.
?Female students will be advised to wear protective clothes other than their uniforms while boys in lower grades who wear short trousers are advised to wear long trousers,? he said.
The Minister further said the circular would be issued soon and that the Ministry had advised schools to conduct dengue prevention programmes and educate their students on the precautions that need to be taken.
Several studies carried out by the Education Ministry had revealed that many of the students affected were from lower grades as they did not wear clothes that covered their entire body.
Accordingly, the Minister advised schools to conduct special cleaning programmes in the schools. (Chaturanga Pradeep)

MYTH: ?Eating carrots will improve your eyesight ?
?
helps:?It?s the Vitamin A in carrots that help eyesight. To maintain vision, you need Vitamin A. There is a pigment in the focal receptors in the eye that requires this vitamin. When patients have a deficiency of this, they face problems with seeing in the dark, or suffer from night-blindness. In the 1960s, many children had vitamin deficiencies and would suffer from night blindness, dry eyes and sometimes total blindness because of lack of Vitamin A and Vitamin D. However, we advise patients to eat carrots in moderation, as too much can cause a yellowish pigmentation in the body. Carrots can?t always help with eye problems and they are not a definite cure, as there could be other causes for problems occuring in your eye. Vitamin A can also be found in other types of food other than carrots, such as green leaves, fruits and other vegetables, so patients needn?t rely on carrots alone,? explained Dr. M. Wijetunge, Retired Consultant Eye Surgeon from the Ragama Teaching Hospital. ? ??

North Korea can strike Alaska
	
?
North Korea on Tuesday said it had tested an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), prompting US experts to say the device could reach Alaska. ??
The launch, which came as the United States prepared to mark its Independence Day, triggered a Twitter outburst from President Donald Trump who urged China to ?put a heavy move? on North Korea to ?end this nonsense once and for all?. ?
The North has long sought to build a rocket capable of delivering an atomic warhead to the continental United States - something that Trump has vowed ?won?t happen?. ?
The launch marks a grave new phase in the country?s decades-long weapons programme. ?
Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said UN Security Council resolutions had clear rules on North Korea?s missile launches and China opposed it going against those rules. He was speaking at a daily news briefing. ??
The ?landmark? test of a Hwasong-14 missile was overseen by leader Kim Jong-Un, an emotional female announcer said on state Korean Central Television. ?It reached an altitude of 1741 miles (2,802 kilometres) and flew 580 miles (933 kilometres) for 39 minutes, she added. ?
?The test-fire was conducted at the highest angle and did not have any negative impact on the safety of neighbouring countries,? Ri said.

## Title: Ouch! Tooth Sensitivity Strikes Again

Ouch! Tooth Sensitivity Strikes Again
	
?
Does an excruciatingly painful sensation flare up every time you sink your teeth into something hot, cold or sweet? This can be torture especially if you are a foodie and live to eat. It isn?t always just about those delectable treats. Even a sip of hot or cold beverage could get those pain receptors all fired up! Getting to the root of the problem, all these symptoms could only mean one thing- Dentin Hypersensitivity or root sensitivity. Doesn?t it ring a bell? Well, then realisation will dawn when the problem is simply termed ?Tooth Sensitivity?. Health Capsule spoke to Dr. Vipula Wickramasinghe, General Secretary of the Sri Lanka Dental Association and Regional Dental Surgeon of the Colombo District, to get a clear picture on dental trauma that makes people clutch their jaws in pain. ?
?
From a medical perspective
A tooth basically consists of the enamel, dentine and pulp. The enamel is a hard and dead tissue with no nerves. The dentine consists of nerve endings, while the pulp is located at the centre of the tooth, made up of living connective tissue and cells called odontoblasts. ?When the dentine of the tooth gets exposed to certain stimuli (heat, cold, sweetness), a sharp throbbing sensation is felt which doesn?t last for long. It is experienced in an ?on and off? basis.?
?
Both young and old suffer
Dr. Wickramasinghe mentioned that tooth sensitivity was a very common dental issue among many. Generally, tooth sensitivity affects older adults within the ages of 45-50. However, tooth sensitivity complaints due to cavities come from both the young and old, age aside. ?
?
?No cavities without sugar?
According to Dr.Wickramasinghe, tooth sensitivity is caused due to several reasons. Dental cavities, attrition, abrasion, tooth fractures and root exposure due to gum disease are some of the causes. ?A common cause is cavities. When the decay reaches the dentine, it is easily exposed to external stimuli like heat, cold, sweetness and acidity in food items, which result in tooth sensitivity when consuming them. Attrition is another factor, which is the wearing off of the tooth. This could be due to ageing or attrite grinding. Abrasion of the tooth occurs with continuous and excessive brushing of teeth. In this case the dentine gets exposed. Tooth fractures may also result in dentine exposure, contributing to sensitivity. With the ageing of a person and due to gum disease, the roots of the tooth may become exposed to the external environment. This causes root exposure, which is yet another reason for tooth sensitivity.? ?
?
Practicing good food habits
If you don?t want to suffer painful tooth sensations each time you devour a feast, prevention is better than cure, and this should remain your number one priority. Dr.Wickramasinghe described several methods you could follow to prevent sensitivity and reduce pain. The most important is to maintain healthy oral hygiene. Cavities, another dental condition, are detrimental to oral health. This could lead to more pain by giving rise to tooth sensitivity, which is why you should brush twice a day. Practicing good food habits and reducing sugar intake is another way to prevent cavities. Minimizing the risk of cavities ultimately helps in the prevention of tooth sensitivity and leaves you with a sparkling smile. If you suffer from tooth cavities, the appropriate treatment has to be taken by visiting your dental surgeon before sensitivity gets the better of you. Dr. Wickramasinghe also recommends visits to the dentist every 6 months to keep your oral health intact to make sure your mouth is not plagued by cavities and gum diseases. ?Brushing habits also affect tooth sensitivity. Brushing with hard bristles increases the probability of falling victim to tooth sensitivity. Thus, toothbrushes with soft bristles are encouraged. Do not brush your teeth with forced continuity. Use of tooth powder is not advised as they have an abrasive impact on the teeth. Use of fluoridated toothpastes is the?best option.? ?
?
tooth filling as treatment
Patients suffer from tooth sensitivity due to various reasons. The treatments thus vary from person to person. The right treatment can only be concluded upon a dental check-up with your dental surgeon after a definite diagnosis. ?Teeth sensitivity due to cavities, abrasions and attritions can be treated by tooth fillings which vary depending on the damage. General tooth sensitivity calls for desensitizing toothpastes and mouthwashes. However, it should be noted that these toothpastes and mouthwashes do not help in dealing with sensitivity caused by cavities. Therefore, tooth sensitivity cannot be treated by resorting to self-diagnosis and home remedies. Always consult your dentist for proper diagnosis and treatment.? ?
?
Toothpaste to the rescue!
Using toothpaste kills two birds with one stone. Using fluoridated toothpaste will help maintain healthy teeth and prevention of cavities. In the case of general tooth sensitivity, desensitizing toothpaste will save the day, while also being softer on the teeth unlike tooth powder. Follow it with a gurgle of desensitizing mouthwash and you are good to go. ?

Prelates don?t know the content of the new Constitution: JVP
	
The Mahanayake Theras of three Nikayas took the unanimous decision of discouraging the formulating of a new Constitution or bringing an amendment to the existing one without any knowledge of its contents, Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) Parliamentarian Bimal Ratnayake said today.
He said President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe should have educated the Mahanayake Theras on this topic.
Responding to a question raised by a journalist at a recent press briefing, MP Ratnayake said the Mahanayake Theras were influenced by facts and figures presented by racist groups who assume the Cabinet would pass a Constitution harmful to the people of the country.
However, the MP said there was no evidence of a proposal to belittle the position accorded to Buddhism by the present Constitution.
He said the democratic process of the country should not be harmed by any religion, and that the country?s governance should not favour a particular religion. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

Prevent Neural Tube Defects
	
?
?
Folic Acid is a B vitamin which is vital for the formation of red blood cells. Folic Acid, together with vitamin B12, is essential for the development of red blood cells. A lack of Folic Acid can cause ?Macrocytic Anaemia.? In addition to red blood cells, the formation of folic acid is essential for DNA formation. Folic Acid is a vital vitamin that can prevent birth conditions called neural tube defects. ?
Sources of Folic acid include leafy green vegetables such as broccoli, spinach, salad greens, beans and legumes as well as oranges and other fruits, poultry, pork and shellfish. Folate is found in a wide variety of foods and folic acid is a water soluble vitamin. It can be destroyed due to overcooking and steaming. ?
Adults and children usually get sufficient amounts of folate (200 micrograms) per day, with a balanced diet. Pregnant women and lactating mothers, however, need around 400 micrograms of folate per day. Such mothers need 1mg of Folic Acid supplements per day. It is important that all expecting mothers take Folic Acid supplements as the nervous system of the foetus develops during the first three months. Spina bifida and anencephaly are neural tube defects that can occur during the development of the spine and brain. Neural tube defects occur very early during pregnancy, usually before the pregnancy is detected. They occur in every 1000 pregnancies. Many babies born with these anomalies face bowel and bladder-related problems. Some babies with major degree anomalies may even die. ??
Studies have shown that neural tube defects can be prevented by increasing the intake of folic acid during and before pregnancy. ?
Folic Acid deficiency can result in anaemia symptoms like weakness of the body, weight loss, headaches and heat palpitation. ?
Folic Acid reduces the blood levels of Homocysteine amino acid, which is a risk factor of developing coronary heart disease. By this folate may help reduce heart disease. ??
?Studies show that 0.4mg per day is sufficient for a pregnant mother but high-risk mothers with a history of having children with neural tube defects or if the mother or her partner has neural tube defect, a higher dose should be taken. Diabetic or overweight mothers may need a higher dose of Folic Acid supplements.

## Title: Rheumatoid Arthritis Arthritis Dealing with red hot joints

Rheumatoid Arthritis Arthritis Dealing with red hot joints
	
?
?A young lady has difficulty moving her hands in the mornings. She has painful, swollen joints which are stiff even hours after waking up. Her leg joints are red and hot. She struggles at office because of inexplicable tiredness. All these are new developments. Although still in her early forties she feels as if she has rapidly aged within a few months. Tasks that were simple a few weeks ago are seemingly?
impossible now.? ?
?
Rheumatoid arthritis is one of the commonest types of joint diseases which mostly affects females between the ages of 30 and 50. There are of course, exceptional cases where the elderly and even teenagers develop this condition. If not treated properly, it can become a devastating disease, with rapid destruction of joints in a matter of weeks to months. The end result if left untreated, is deformed joints. Some patients have this mild rheumatoid, which appears intermittently and doesn?t cause much trouble. As this is an autoimmune disease, it can inflict harm not just on joints but on other organs as well, including nerves, lungs, eyes, skin and blood vessels. ?
?
Overactive Immunity
The condition is a result of an overactive immune system. As you are aware, the immune system protects against invasive germs like bacteria, viruses, fungi and parasites. A protein particle called an ?antibody? is responsible for our intact immunity. Imagine what would happen if these antibodies were produced within our body against our own joints? There will be catastrophic consequences with the destruction of joints and surrounding structures. In rheumatoid arthritis, two types of antibodies namely ?Rheumatoid factor? and ?Anti CCP? are produced. Once we detect antibodies in the blood, it will be easier to diagnose the condition. ?
The same antibody-mediated process can cause harm to other organs outside joints. We call this extra-articular disease. Articular space is where two bones rub each other and create a joint. Hence, extra-articular is just outside this joint space. ? Overactive immunity leads to a process called inflammation, which is simply an additional and unnecessary attempt by the body to supply blood to an affected region. With this extra blood supply to cells, a destruction of that region can be caused. Sometimes rheumatoid arthritis is called inflammatory arthritis due?to this. ??
Tissue Swelling
The most frequent complaint is joint pain with or without swelling. In fair-skinned patients, we sometimes see a bit of redness over the skin. Other problems patients encounter include joint stiffness. If you forget the pain, the joints feel as if they are pasted on one another early morning. An extra effort is needed for patients to move the joints. This gets better as the day progresses. Therefore, most symptoms in rheumatoid arthritis are seen early in the morning. ? Joint swelling is seen because of two reasons. There could be a collection of fluid/water inside the joints. This causes the skin surrounding the joint to balloon up. The other reason is tissue swelling. Rheumatoid arthritis affects the hands classically, in a symmetrical fashion. It can also affect wrists, elbows, shoulders, knees, ankles, toes and sometimes the jaw joint. ?
Tiredness is another feature of rheumatoid arthritis. Patients say this is a new onset of tiredness, which was not present months before. There could be many reasons for this condition, which is given the term ?fatigue? in western medicine. The chemical change created within the body can cause inappropriate tiredness. Also, if rheumatoid arthritis causes low blood cell counts or what we describe as anaemia, this in turn will contribute to tiredness as well. ? Together with joint disease, one might develop extra-articular problems. Very severe rheumatoid arthritis affects the eyes. It can cause harm to the outer aspects of the eyes. Sometimes, the lungs get partly destroyed. Nerve dysfunction can lead to abnormal sensation and even muscle paralysis. Skin rashes, ?nodules? just beneath the skin and problems with blood vessels are some of the other manifestations of rheumatoid. ?
?
Patients need urgent attention?
As we discussed earlier, the early phases of rheumatoid arthritis do not cause much trouble apart from symptoms like pain and stiffness. If left untreated, the process called inflammation can lead to permanent destruction of joints. There is no scientific way of growing back a new joint from a destroyed joint. There is no miracle pill as such. So the prevention of rheumatoid arthritis by controlling the disease is the best option. ?
If an overactive immune system is the key issue in rheumatoid arthritis, joint specialists control the immune system in such a way so that a perfect balance is created. We use tablets and sometimes injections to control rheumatoid arthritis. ?
You might ask me, why not cure the disease rather than control it? As rheumatoid arthritis is all about immunity, complete cure means putting a halt to the functioning of the immune system. As this is impossible, what we do is control the disease, so that ultimately patients are free of symptoms and complications. This is like pushing a rubber ball beneath the surface of a pond. We keep on pushing till the water drains out of the pond one day. Then comes the question as to whether rheumatoid arthritis lasts a lifetime. The simple answer is no. In most instances, the disease disappears and ?the joint specialists will slowly reduce the dose of your medication. ?
?
What are the treatment options available??
First the details relating to the symptoms are gathered. A complete examination of not just the joints, but the whole area, is carried out. Ideally this is done on an examination bed. The patient is asked to move the affected joints throughout the full range and then the consultant will passively move these joints, taking care not to inflict pain. ?
A detailed analysis of the affected joints is then carried out where pressure is applied in a lighter fashion. Determination of whether a fluid collection is there inside the joint space is done. Certain blood tests will be ordered together with certain X-rays and scans. ?
?
The joint specialist will offer various treatment options for rheumatoid arthritis. He will also provide you with information about the side-effects of the medication. One of the most common drugs used are Disease Modifying Anti Rheumatoid Drugs (DMARDS). Methotrexate, Hydroxychloroquine and Leflunamide are some of these. These are very specific meds which will slowly control the disease process. ?
Steroids are also used to rapidly provide relief till the DMARDS settle in. This is called bridging therapy. Pain-relieving agents called NSAIDS (Voltaren, Brufen) are also used intermittently to control pain but do note that they are not effective in controlling rheumatoid arthritis. Injections bring quick relief to swollen joints and are also useful to bring out unnecessary fluids. ?
While taking medication, the specialist will also advice you on certain gentle forms of exercise that sooth the joints. Certain tips on carrying out activities of daily living are also taught. For example, how to open a jar lid, how to carry shopping bags and how to open a tin. ?
Physiotherapy and occupational therapy are also useful in treating rheumatoid arthritis. The consultant might arrange a meeting with the therapists based on your requirements. ?
There is a new form of treatment called biological agents, where the harmful antibodies are countered by artificial antibodies. These biological agents are administered as infusions or injections to patients on whom tablets have no effect. ?

SAITM Issue -- President calls for common stance by Govt.
	
President Maithripala Sirisena is reported to have said the government should project a common stance on the SAITM issue instead of ministers making contradictory statements.
The Cabinet discussed this matter yesterday amid ministers expressing various views on it. Ministers like Rajitha Senaratne and S.B. Dissanayake are in favour of SAITM being operated as a non-state university while Ministers Patali Champika Ranawaka and Dayasiri Jayasekara asking that it be abolished.
However, against this background the President stressed the need for the government to take a common stance on this matter.
The government has proposed that SAITM be administered by a trustee and another proposal to reduce the fees charged from students. The President said all demands, other than the one for nationalising SAITM, had been met and pointed out that the final decision would be taken after the Supreme Court ruling on the matter.

Stay order may worsen crisis: Ranil
	
Stay orders issued on disposal of garbage will worsen the crisis with regard to the collection and disposal of waste, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe told Parliament today.
He said this when responding to JVP MP BImal Ratnayake who informed him about the stay order issued by the Supreme Court on disposing of garbage at Muturajawela.
"Stay orders will create more issues especially at a time when diseases such as dengue are spreading," the Prime Minister said while stressing that courts should have initiated a discussion with all stakeholders.
He said the Kesbewa Magistrate Court should conclude the pending case with regard to the disposal of garbage at Karadiyana.
?The main issue pertaining to garbage is not collection from households but disposing it," the Prime Minister said and added that it would be possible to dump 1,200 tons of garbage daily at Aruwakaru.
He said garbage from Colombo, Dehiwala and Kolonnawa could be disposed at Karuwakaru for twenty years and that the recycling of garbage at Muthurajawela would be expanded soon.
The Prime Minister several recycling centres would be set up jointly with the private sector and that these projects would comprise power generation using garbage and the production of fertilizer. "These would be investments more or less and suitable lands for these products have been ear-marked for this purpose," the Prime minister said
He said 250 garbage transportation trucks would be absorbed to the existing fleet belonging to various local bodies and the central government to make waste collection more efficient. The Prime Minister said these would be purchased through state funds and the Korean credit line.
?Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka has been given the task of handling the garbage issue. I had a discussion with him and there should be some kind of breakthrough by tomorrow,? he added. (Yohan Perera and Ajith Siriwardana)

Tribute to Fr. Glenn Fernando: The Good Samaritan
	
Yesterday marked his 10th death anniversary
When the sun is high up in the sky and the day is hot, it is not often that someone would be so foolish as to pour a glass of perfectly good ?cool beverage? down the sink. But that was exactly what I did. A few sips of the drink out of courtesy and that was all. The prejudice was too strong. Looking ?.. to make sure ??. The would-see me in the act. I welded over to the wash basin and disposed of the drink. ?
This sorry little stone enacted by the Canal Bank that runs deacons to the Narahenpita Pola, not too far from the offices of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles. Many of the people who walk down the path that leads to No. 354/14, Elvitigala Mawatha, are past middle aged but there are some who are young as well. If they, are looked at more closely, they would be seen to be people who are minus some of their physical parts such as fingers or limbs. But they are not victims of speeding traffic. Most of them are not amputees either. Many of them have physical extremities such as fingers or even noses, that have shrunk. ?
But the problem SUROL, like many other charitable organizations faces is that neither SUROL nor its devotion has failed to get the much-needed impression
When the nerves at the end of our bodies, the parts of the body that die first lose their sensation and then begin to shrink. That is leprosy. These people were lepers. The place we were at was the Society for Upliftment and Rehabilitation of Leprosy Patients (SUROL). Of course, today, sanitized language is in vogue and the term ?leper? is on longer used to describe these unfortunate people. That word has undesirable connotations of referring to social outcast. ??
Curable
In the past, lepers were chased out of society and had to fend for themselves in pitiable conditions. They were neither cared for nor reached. But no longer does our society legally sanction such a harsh attitude towards people infected with the disease of leprosy. Perhaps the reason for carrying the greatest weight is at a very small risk today of having to live permanently with the disease. ?
Leprosy was once a dreaded disease coming down from ancient times. It is caused by a germ called ?Mycobacterium Leprous.? That is the very germ that induced me to get rid of my drink. Although leprosy is an infectious disease, it is not easily caught as most of us have some immunity to it. Poor and undernourished people are most at risk just as they are to any other infectious diseases. ?
Today, however leprosy can be cured if treated at the early stages. When the disease only shows itself as an insensitive patch on the skin. The cure is permanent and total. On the other hand, if the disease is permitted to continue untreated, and ulcers and deformities set in, then the patient would always need treatment. ?
Vocation
SUROL has its origins in 1971, when a foreign Jesuit priest, Rev. Fr. Chiriarty started to help the leprosy patients he come across on an informant basis. A few years later, a Swiss NGO ?Emmaus? involved in leprosy work and began to fund this project. ?
SUROL now works with 480 families all over the island. There were about 30 patients present on the day that I visited the centre. Some of them had come from as far away as Matara and Puttalam to claim their refit. The main centre is at Narahenpita and there are branches in Kandy and Jaffna. ?
The Jaffna branch is sustained by a single dedicated worker who remains valiantly at his past, despite the great difficulties of life in the north. He attends Clinics, pays out the monthly allowance and ensures that minor repair work is done to the houses of leprosy patients. ?
Although SUROL is non-sectarian and helps leprosy patients of all communities. Rev. Fr. Glenn Fernando, a Catholic priest was its Secretary and the heart of the organization. His priestly status was difficult to discern as he was clad in ordinary shirt and trousers, but his priestly vocation was immediately obvious. ?
Support
With Rev. Fr. Glenn Fernando, was Stan Fernando, the Deputy Treasurer of the organization who had invited me to see their work. And whom I have known for most of my life as ?Uncle Stan? who once lived our next door. The two of them explained that most of their work involes providing for the economic needs of the patients. They did this by providing the parietal with a monthly allowance in some cases and with self-employment projects where appropriate. ?
This helps to supplement the governments? monthly dole of Rs.500 per family or Rs.200 for an unmarried patient which was clearly not sufficient even to out a very modest living in these days of high inflation. But far from helping the voluntary sector to make up for its own inadequacies, the government is doing its best to control the voluntary NGO sector through a variety of heavy- handed means oblivious to the fact that the spirit of voluntarism is not susceptible to control and is only destroyed by controls. ?
Helping these poor people to become economically self-reliant, is an extremely difficult task requiring much effort that money cannot buy. Some of the leprosy patients really could do nothing. They need constant help. For instance, those who are old and do not have their fingers or limbs need to have someone to look after them. But sometimes, even the hospitals in the areas where the patients come from, do not take them in for treatment due to fear. ??
Donors
At present, perhaps the only home for the aged that is willing to take in leprosy patients is Marc Sri, a home for the destitutes in Kalutara. ?
SUROL is now putting up its own home to accommodate up to 20 aged leprosy patients next to the Marc Sri home in Kalutara. Unfortunately, due to their own financial shortcomings, SUROL?s foreign donor Emmaus, is cutting its contribution by 25% this year. We have to make up for this by raising funds locally through donations, says Stan Fernando. He adds hopefully that SUROL?s bank account at the Commercial Bank - Borella Branch is 01-201103401.
Those who take the trouble to visit SUROL are willing to contribute more. Fr. Glen Fernando says one such couple gives Rs.2,500 every months. But a problem that SUROL, like many other charitable organizations faces is that neither SUROL nor its devotion has failed to get the much-needed impression. In general, when people knew of a deserving project, they were willing to help. In November last year, SUROL sent out letters to about 150 individuals who were personally known to its staffers. They received over Rs.50,000 in donations. However, the needs are ten times more that amount received. ?
Rehabilitation
Utilizing the limited funds at its disposal, SUROL has helped more than 30 patients to set up income generating businesses by providing them with loans for sewing machines, fishing nets, carpentry tools and setting up grocery stores etc among other projects. The amount provided as a loan depends on the nature of the project and could go up to Rs.15,000. The monthly repayment depends on the earning capacity, and not on any fixed rate of interest. ?
H.A. Peter, a tall and handsome man of 54, was at the SUROL office that day to request a loan of Rs.1,000. He had fallen sick and as a result had to spend a part of the Capital. Peter had contracted leprosy during his prime. Since he did not get treatment, his fingers have shrunk. Peter has been selling lottery tickets. ?
Usually he manages to sell about 50 lottery tickets a day, which is enough to support himself and his wife. She was also a leprosy patient whom he met at the Hendala Leprosy Hospital. ?
Peter?s belief is that most people are sympathetic but do not ostracise him. But leprosy patients are always afraid of evoking a negative response from others. One patient has not still told her children that she has been undergoing treatment for leprosy, which has slightly disfigured her hands. Her children are perfectly healthy and she fears knowing a leper is at home would be too much for them to bear. ?

Udayanga had not returned his passport: Ravi
	
Foreign Minister Ravi Karunanayake said yesterday even though the government had cancelled the Diplomatic Passport of former Sri Lankan Ambassador to Russia Udayanga Weeratunge, he had not returned it to the authorities.
He told parliament that he had visited Japan, Pakistan and Dubai with former President Mahinda Rajapaksa on several occasions recently.
He said this in response to a question raised by JVP MP Dr. Nalinda Jayatissa.
Dr. Jayatissa said former Deputy Foreign Minister Harsha De Silva had earlier told parliament in response to a question raised by him that Mr. Weeratunge''s Diplomatic Passport was cancelled but the Fort Magistrate last week ordered to suspend it.
He asked if the Deputy Minister had given wrong information in parliament saying that it was cancelled.
Minister Karunanayake said a detailed answer to the question would be given shortly. (Ajith Siriwardana and Yohan Perera)

Vastu Dosha blocking his political ambitions!
	
A renowned astrologer has reportedly told a certain upcountry political leader that a Vastu Dosha (an architectural defect) in the building housing his political office is an impediment to his getting a high office in the government.?
?
The politico is said to be busy these days planning to put up a new wing according to Vastu Vidya principles which could cause the cancellation of the Dosha afflicting the existing building. Meanwhile, a series of Shanti Karma rituals is being conducted to dispel all other malefic influences inhibiting his political ambitions. He has got down well known priests from the neighboring country to conduct these rituals.
However, people in the upcountry say that there is no need for him to look far and wide for the ?villain? blocking his path to high office because he is there closer home as large as life!

Wooing the one they deserted
	
?
There was a special meeting of Blue party big guns at the residence of a Southern party stalwart holding a big secretarial office.
?
When the subject of the local polls round the corner came up, some of them pointed out that winning the polls would be no easy task given the present political situation unfavourable for the party. At this stage, several stalwarts took up the position that they should have the blessings of the former strongman if they were to win the polls. To everyone?s surprise, it was a big-mouthed flamboyant one from Uva holding purohita status at state level who took his turn to fiercely support this idea. ?We can?t win any future election without his blessings. That?s the reality,? he asserted despite being critical of the former boss in the recent past.?
However, the secretarial one playing the host immediately took exception to this proposition. ?I understand that the vociferous group loyal to the former boss has entered into a secret pact with the Green party. So wooing the former boss is out of question,? he pointed out.
A heated argument over pros and cons of wooing the former boss ensued. And it was the flamboyant one from Uva who had the last word: ?Fabricating stories will take us nowhere. Let us either face the ground reality or be resigned to come what may!?, he said.
The argument ended on this indecisive note.

All you need to know about Morning sickness
	
It is said that motherhood is the greatest crown a woman could bear. But as with everything worth having in life, the road to this is not an easy one. Pregnancy brings with it many new ordeals, both physical and psychological. Facing the changes experiences goes through, particularly in a first time pregnancy, can be challenging. This is why we decided to take you through one of the most frequent complaints in pregnancy, commonly called ?morning sickness?. ?
?
How the body responds to pregnancy
Pregnancy is a miraculous thing, even from a medical point of view. A female body shelters and nourishes a separate being created within. Every system in the body undergoes change from the first week onwards to hold the foetus inside the womb and prevent it from being rejected by the body?s immune system. The body fulfills nutritional requirements and prepares for labour. With these transformations taking place inside, an array of outward symptoms are to be expected. ?
?
Feeling nauseated?
Morning sickness, also called the Nausea and Vomiting of Pregnancy (NVP), occurs in more than eighty percent of all pregnant women. While nausea is the commonest complaint, more than fifty percent complain of vomiting as well. The term ?morning sickness? is a misnomer because the symptoms can occur any time of the day. The exact cause of the disease is not known, but it is believed to be multifactorial. The hormone oestrogen and the hormone secreted by the human placenta, hCG, are said to play a part in this. Interestingly, the pattern of morning sickness differs from woman to woman and even from pregnancy to pregnancy in the same person. ??
Even though many first-time mothers find this condition alarming, it is self-limiting most of the time. In most pregnancies, the symptoms start within 4-8 weeks of pregnancy and automatically cease around 16-20 weeks. Numerous research done on the subject have concluded that there is no association between morning sickness and adverse pregnancy outcomes, so it is not necessary to worry about morning sickness being bad for the baby. ??
?
What you can do
In many women, nausea is triggered by strong odours or flavours. Identifying the triggering factors and avoiding them as much as possible is advised. ??
An empty stomach is believed to worsen the symptoms, so having multiple small light meals throughout the day in place of three large meals is advisable. Bland food like crackers, dry toast and potato chips usually help relieve the symptoms. Avoid food rich in fats because emptying the stomach is delayed with fatty food. ?
Drinking tea, king coconut and other beverages containing sugar or salt in between meals is advised. Some researchers have found that ginger is particularly helpful in relieving queasiness during pregnancy. You can either add ginger to your tea or drink water boiled with ginger at least twice a day. ?
If you are one of those people who gets nausea as soon as you get up in the morning, nibbling on a few crackers as soon as you wake up and staying in bed for 20-30 minutes may help. Also, avoid sudden movements as much as possible because this may upset your balance system, triggering nausea. ?
Low appetite as a result of NVP is unlikely to hinder the growth of the foetus in the first trimester, as long as you continue taking the antenatal vitamins. ?
Prescribing medication in pregnancy is a delicate matter, because some of the drugs may affect the growth of the foetus. Therefore, never self-prescribe medication. If you have difficulty carrying out your day-to-day activities, always consult a doctor. You will be given selected drugs if it is deemed necessary. ?
?
Hyperemesis Gravidarum
Hyperemesis gravidarum is a condition where a mother gets severe and intractable vomiting during the first trimester of the pregnancy. This may result in marked weight loss and muscle wasting, in addition to dehydration and electrolyte imbalance in the mother. It may occasionally give rise to other complications like tears in the gastrointestinal tract due to severe retching and may even affect the central nervous system. If not diagnosed and treated timely, this condition has the risk of negatively affecting the foetus, unlike simple nausea and vomiting in pregnancy, so knowing when to seek medical treatments is important.?
?
When to contact?your doctor
?Severe nausea or vomiting ?
	?When you aren?t able to keep any food down for a minimum of 24 hours. ?
	?If you are losing weight due to vomiting and loss of appetite ?
	?If you notice a reduction in urine output ?
	?If you vomit blood ?

Anecdotes from my time with Richmond College, Galle
	
Nizam Cader, was born in 1926 making him 91 years, as of date. He is one of the founder members of the ?Sixty Club?. It is remarkable that he could recall some anecdotes from his time. He sent a letter reminiscing his days at Richmond which is reproduced below unedited except for correcting the spelling of a name.?
Richmond College is now 204 years old; started by the British Missionary
	During our time, there were only 325 students. now I think it is well over 4,000
	Every third child had to pay only 50 cents as facility fees!
	On a clear day, Adam?s Peak could be seen from Richmond Hill
Greetings to the members of Richmond College over 60?s club. I joined in 1933 and studied up to 1940. Richmond is now 204 years old, and was started by the?British missionary. ??
I was born in Galle Fort on August 17, 1926. My two brothers Razik and Dr. Zain Cader, and my cousins Lafat Hassen, Dr. Ansari Hassen, and M.C.T. Cassim travelled together from Galle Fort to school. I started schooling from Kindergarten. The Head Teacher Rita Kale also lived in Galle Fort. The other KG teachers were Ms. E.M. Jansz, L.N. Jansz, and Ms. Gunewardene. ??
I don?t know how to start, but I will mention what comes to my mind... ??
From Kindergarten, we went to standard 2. I still remember the great principal of the school, mainly the Rev. A.A. Sneath, who was an imposing figure who visited our classes once in a way. I also remember E.R. de Silva, followed by Shelton Wirasinha. Rev. Dolby was one of the Principals of Richmond College during my time. ??
Every day we used to have assembly in the Darrell Hall, a masterpiece in engineering. A roof standing without any support from below. Rev. Darrell planned and built the college hall. He died during the plague helping the sick. ??
We had some great teachers at the time. Saa Bandaranayake who later became the headmaster of Royal Primary. Maj. Adihetty was more a preacher than a teacher and discipline was number one for him. As soon as he entered the class, he would write on the blackboard ?Don?t have Jealousy, Anger and Pride? (emphasis by the editor). ? During the Richmond vs Mahinda match, he would say ?If Mahinda plays well cheer Mahinda, if Richmond does well cheer Richmond. Play the game, play fair and let the better side win? (emphasis by the editor). ??
We also had teachers like A.C.G. Abeywardene who liked to play the fool in or out of the class. R. S. Wickremasinghe, S.I. Perera, K.T. Koshy (From India) and Ms. Gunewardene were the other teachers. ??
About a year ago, I went to Richmond College and met the Principal, and got his permission to open the Darrell Hall for me which he readily did. During our time, it was an assembly hall, where we sung ?hymns or the Principal addressed the students. It is sad to say that the hundreds of chairs that were used for assembly were not there any more, perhaps been put to other use. ??
Every day we used to have assembly in the Darrell Hall, a masterpiece in engineering. A roof standing without any support from below. Rev. Darrell planned and built the college hall. He died during the plague helping the sick
During our time, there were only 325 students. Now I think over 4,000. During my time, G.W.S. de Silva, was collecting the school fees. During the British period, parents were encouraged to send children to school, and every 3rd child had to only pay 50 cents as facility fees! I had to pay only 50 cents. I am sad to say the beautiful flamboyant trees on the way to Richmond Hill are no more. It was said on a clear day, Adam?s Peak could be seen from Richmond Hill. There was a big ?Ata Amba? tree which was supposed to be haunted. We dreaded to pass that tree on concert days at night. I used to close my eyes and run down the hill. At that time, there was one tap, in which all our boys used to quench their thirst. This was opposite the kindergarten. ??
Sometimes our books would get stolen, so we used to write on the inside cover ?Steal not this book for fear or shame for God will ask on the judgment day, where the book you stole that day? (emphasis by the editor). ??
At the end of the year, the boys had autograph albums in which the children would write, what they wished. One such thing I can remember was ?the grass is green, the rose is red, remember me till I am dead, dead, dead?. ?Some anecdotes? I recall from Richmond days: the boys used to sing a song before the year end - One week more and where shall we be - out of the bounds of RCG. From Richmond, I went to S. Thomas? Mt. Lavinia in 1940, and did my O/Levels there. My favourite subject was general knowledge both at Richmond and STC. I can remember the longest river in the world Nile and the highest mountain, Mt. Everest, and Sri Lanka?s highest mountain the Piduruthalagala in Nuwara Eliya 6,199ft. I could remember all the railway stations from Galle to Colombo and the largest railway network in the world (India) and the distance from point Pedro to Dondra Head. ??
Before the end of the exam, the class teacher used to assess the chances of each student. When it came to my turn, he put his hand on his head, and said ?Oh Cader, miracles do happen?. But it did not happen. I left school and joined the family business on March 14, 1947. Thus ended my school career by mentioning the Thomian motto ?Be thou forever Richmond?. May God Bless Richmond College. Now I am retired, and a grandfather of five boys and two girls, and great grandfather of two great grandchildren. This is the happiest time of my life. ??
I wish all the Richmondites; past and present and all the teachers and the Principal of Richmond College, the best of luck. Richmond is most certainly one of the best schools in?Sri Lanka. ??

Anyone watching TV feels there is no Govt. in the country: President
	
Anyone watching the TV in the evenings, would think that there is no country and or a government in the country.
Assumptions are made about what is going to happen the following day. The media reveals the opposite of what is really happening in the country.
The Development activities, people's welfare, the peaceful situation in the country are all portrayed turning these facts upside down, mainly to attract people?s attention.
They always show tense situations and destructions, said President Maithripala Sirisena at Ratnapura after declaring open a children?s ward.
Philanthropists Punsiri Tennekoon, Priyantha De Silva Subash Karunarathne and American national Louis Allen had spent Rs 100 million in constructing this two storey children?s ward.
The President went on saying that he was happy to have officiated at this opening of a ward that would cater to the sick people of Ratnapura, and he had made frequent visits to this hospital for various development activities done at this hospital.
He said that he attended a state officials meeting in Gampaha in the morning where emphasis was made about the anti-Dengue activities and garbage clearance work. There were reports of landslides in the Ratnapura District resulting from unauthorized mining and construction of buildings without following stipulated conditions. (Ajith Lal Shantha Udaya and P. A.

DHAKA (Daily Mail), July 4, 2017- The death toll from a blast at a Bangladesh garment factory has risen to 10 after two victims died in hospital, authorities said Tuesday, warning there could be more casualties. ??
Dozens of workers were inside the factory on the outskirts of Dhaka when the boiler exploded on Monday evening, causing a section of the six-storey building to collapse. ??
The explosion, which occurred when most workers were off for the Eid holidays, is the latest disaster to hit the country?s $30-billion garment industry. ??
The plant in the Gazipur industrial district is owned by textiles manufacturer Multifabs, which makes clothing for brands including Littlewoods and Aldi, according to its website. ?
Factory authorities said the main site was closed on Monday, and the workers there were conducting boiler maintenance. ?
Relatives of missing workers gathered at the factory premises late Monday. ?
?My father is a boiler operator at this factory. He was called yesterday on his day off to work on boiler maintenance,? said Mehedi Hasan. ?
?Ten minutes after my father left home, we heard the news of the blast. And now I came here as he doesn?t pick up his phone,? he said in tears. ?
Bangladesh has more than 4,500 garment factories employing four million mostly female workers at a minimum monthly wage of $68. ?

Bill to suppress media: JVP
	
Journalists and media institutions would have to reveal their sources in future if the new Bill on media was passed in Parliament, JVP MP Nalinda Jayatissa charged today.
?The Government is attempting to pass the Bill to suppress the media to prevent them from exposing the truth of the Unity Government,? he said.
He said the Government?s intention was to control information and to keep the people?s good impression on the Government.
He said that the same Government who baton charged students were targeting journalists and other media figures.
Speaking on the Local Government elections he charged the Government kept postponing the elections until the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) resolved its internal issues.
He said that postponement of the LG elections was a violation of Supremacy of the People in a democracy. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

Delving into Welikada jail riot
	
The failure to promptly open and carry out a criminal investigation into the deaths of 27 inmates in Welikada prison during a riot and its aftermath on November 9 and 10 of 2012 has become a stigma to the justice system in Sri Lanka. Human rights activists and organisations had expressed concerns at the lack of a prompt and expeditious investigation and the impunity of the culprits.?
Despite having strong evidence and testimonies of a number of witnesses to the shooting incident, no formal inquiry was opened during the previous regime or the present. The families of those killed together with rights watchdog claim that those responsible for the alleged massacre include some powerful political and security officials.?
Five years have lapsed since the deaths of 27 inmates. Despite several commissions being appointed to inquire into the incident, none of these commissions had the authorisation to investigate and prosecute the offenders. However, eye witnesses? fingers point at the same people. All witnesses had given statements against the same group of people.?
Appeal Court to hear petition on July 7
In the absence of a formal investigation by the government, an eye witness to the incident Sudesh Nandimal Silva recently sought an order from the Court of Appeal, directing the Inspector General Police (IGP) and the Director of the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) to commence an investigation into these deaths.
Nandimal Silva, who was in remand custody when the riot occured, cited Commissioner General of Prisons, Director of CID, IGP, Minister of Prison Reforms and the Attorney General as respondents in his writ petition.
Speaking to Daily Mirror, he said most of the inmates who died inside the prison were those who had filed Fundamental Rights cases and petitions before the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka (HRCSL) against Police Inspector M. Neomal Rangajeewa of the PNB, Former Defence Secretary Rajapaksa and Former Magazine Prison Superintendent Emil Ranjan Lamahewage.
?
My life is in danger?
- Eye witness Nandimal
Sudesh Nandimal Silva alleged that the purpose of the STF which came in hundreds to Welikada Prison on November 9 was to create a problem and fulfill their target.
?I was told by a prison officer that the STF came on an order of former Defence Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa. We heard a commotion from the wards to which the STF entered on the pretext of searching for drugs and mobile phones. We heard our inmates screaming. After some time, we figured out that tear gas had been fired into the cells where our inmates were trapped. It was such an inhuman act. We had no place to even run and avoid being tear-gassed.?
?
We heard our inmates screaming. After some time, we figured out that tear gas had been fired
They asked me whether I was Nandimal and they asked me not to pull up the Welikada case because if it is taken up some of them will have to end up in prison. They threatened me not to get involved.?
?
?Then, inmates started storming the cells. That was when the inmates lost their patience and started hitting back with whatever they caught. The riots began. It should be noted that the prisoners, who were seen on the roof bearing the rifles, were not shot at by the STF. Some selected inmates inside their cells were shot dead by the STF. None of the prisoners wanted to escape. If they wanted, they could have done it earlier.? ?However, by midnight, the situation was controlled and the weapons were returned to the prison officers. The prisoners obeyed the prison officers because the prisoners had been known and associating with them for years. The STF returned in the middle of the night. One of the inmates ?Lester? who was talking with a prison officer was shot in the neck from behind. At 4 in the morning, they came and dragged Thushara Chandana alias ?Kalu Thushara?, one of the inmates. I witnessed how he was forced to kneel and was shot in the head. I personally don?t know Rangajeewa. But, I heard Thushara saying ?Rangajeewa sir, please don?t kill me,?
Threatening incidents
?Weeks after I gave testimony before the CID, a vehicle started following my motorcycle. One day, two men had come to my work place from the same vehicle and inquired about me from the security guards. One of the security guards had written down the number of the vehicle. An investigation was launched by the Maligawatta Police upon my complaint and it was revealed that the vehicle, which followed me, belonged to the PNB. Further inquiries weren?t continued thereafter.?
?On another day, three individuals wearing caps whistled and called me over when I was going to the junction in Moratuwa to get a reload for my phone. They asked me whether I was Nandimal and they asked me not to pull up the Welikada case because if it is taken up some of them will have to end up in prison. They threatened me not to get involved.? ?Lately, they used a radio programme to sling mud at me and threaten me. The so-called presenters of this radio programme branded me as a ?Sinhala Kotiya? (Sinhala tiger). I have a family. They faced many difficulties after the show was broadcast. I lodged a complaint against the radio programme with the Police Division for the Protection of Victims and Witnesses. I will not stop because I am not afraid, but I know there is a danger to my life.?
?
No need for an inquiry?
- Frm. Defence Sec. Gotabaya Rajapaksa
Former Defence Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa told the Daily Mirror that he did not believe that the incident should be investigated.?
?There is no need of an inquiry. There was a situation going on in the prison on November 9, 2012 when the search for illegal arms and drugs were being carried out. All what the STF did was their job to maintain law and order. It was the normal procedure in this country. They have to control such situations. As the prisoners broke the armoury and started firing with the firearms, the STF only acted how they are supposed to do their job.?
?
I was not involved at all in the incident.?
?I was not involved at all in the incident. How can they charge me like that? I was not even there. They are trying to target me according to their political agendas. Anybody can level allegations against anyone. However, these allegations are baseless. Why should I plan such things inside a prison? Why should I kill those prisoners whom I have never even seen? Give me a reason. I had better work to do during that time.? ?I have sacrificed my life for this country. I have worked hard to bring peace to this country. I don?t know why I am being targeted by these people regarding incidents which I have no involvement in.? ?Those who point fingers at me are blaming me with their neo-liberal mindsets even for finishing the thirty-year war. They don?t even know the gravity of this incident which took place in Welikada Prison. I think we should not waste time talking about these kinds of matters.?
?
Implementation of CIPI recommendations within 3 months?
- Prison Reforms Minister D.M. Swaminathan?
The recommendations given by the three-member Committee Inquiring into the Prison Incident 2012 (CIPI) will be implemented within a time frame of three months
?
The recommendations given by the three-member Committee Inquiring into the Prison Incident 2012 (CIPI) will be implemented within a time frame of three months as directed by the Prisons Reforms Minister D.M.Swaminathan, ministry media unit told the Dailymirror?On the instructions of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, Minister Swaminathan had directed IGP Pujith Jayasundara, Senior DIG of Police Crimes Investigation Department (CID) Nandana Munasinghe and Senior State Counsel of Attorney General?s Department Janaka Bandara to start implementing the recommendations given by the CIPI regarding the Welikada riots where 27 inmates were killed.?
A meeting was called by Minister Swaminathan on June 14 at the Prisons Reforms Ministry to discuss further actions based on the CIPI which submitted its report in June 2015 to the Prime Minister.
During the meeting, SDIG Nandana Munasinghe had informed the minister that the CID investigation which was initiated in 2012 would be completed soon.
?
Sufficient proof to recommend a criminal investigation?
- ?S.K.Liyanage, a member of the Nambuwasam Committee
Retired Administrative Official and Attorney-at-Law S.K.Liyanage, who is a member of the three-member Committee- headed by Retired Supreme Court Judge Wimal Nambuwasam and Retired DIG Asoka Wijetilake-Inquiring into the Prison Incident 2012 (CIPI) said that there was enough evidence to reach two final recommendations that a criminal investigation should be launched into the case. He added that the respective families of the victims should be compensated.
?No one tried to level pressure on us when carrying out inquiries into the incident. Members of the victims? families and the witnesses had confidence in our committee compared to the previous commissions. I believe it was because of the government change.? ?We appreciate the government?s first move to approve the compensation procedure. However, it is doubtful as to why the other and the most important recommendation is disregarded hitherto. Government Analyst said going by the blood stains and other scientific evidence, many of the prisoners were shot within short range. He had also said that the inmates were kneeling or sitting on something at the time of the shooting.? ?When recording statement, Former Defence Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa, who is said to be the main suspect of the case, told the committee that the STF wasn?t under his control, as such he did not give such orders to shoot the prisoners. The committee was told by him that the STF was under the purview of Former SDIG Anura Senanayake. As far as we are concerned, the IGP was not even in country on November 9, 2012.?

?
When recording statement, Former Defence Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa, who is said to be the main suspect of the case, told the committee that the STF wasn?t under his control,
?What makes it ironic is that the then IGP who also gave a statement to the committee had said from the inception that the STF was under Gotabaya Rajapaksa?s control and the IGP had nothing to do with it. However, finally it was made clear that several parties had wanted to put and end to the lives of some prisoners due to various reasons.?
?
Yahapalana govt. following footsteps of previous govt?
- Activist Ranjith Keerthi Tennakoon
Anti Corruption Front (ACF) Convener and Social Activist Ranjith Keerthi Tennakoon said the prison shooting was a deliberate crime. ?There is sufficient evidence to prove that the inmates who died had been targeted in a premeditated manner. The Yahapalana government that pledged to punish the culprits of the shooting is now following in the same footsteps of the previous government by dragging the case. We doubt whether they too are shielding someone. Compensating the victims? families is not enough as an obvious crime has been committed here. They need justice, not money.?
?
Commissions had no power to implement their recommendations?
? Frm. HRCSL Chairman Dr. Prathiba Mahanamahewa
Former Human Rights Commissioner and Rights Activist Dr. Prathiba Mahanamahewa said the commissions appointed by the government in order to investigate into serious incidents such as 2012 Welikada shooting should be given judicial powers to a certain degree.
?Authorising the commissions with judicial powers would accelerate the prosecution process as it would not be necessary for the commissions to wait until the given recommendations are taken up for implementation in court.?
However, what needs to be done is collect all the completed committee reports, analyze them and implement the recommendations immediately. The Welikada case should be instituted in relevant courts in order to prosecute the suspects.?
?
Case used for political gains?
- Attorney-at-Law Senaka Perera?for the Writ Petitioner
Attorney-at-Law Senaka Perera who appears on behalf of Sudesh Nandimal Silva told the Daily Mirror that the case was used for political gains. He added that the case was purposely delayed due to the attempts to shield the culprits.
?There are jailers who are ready to testify as they witnessed the entire incident. But, they are waiting until the prosecutions begin. But, the government is keeping silent.?
There are jailers who are ready to testify as they witnessed the entire incident.
?The Nambuwasam Committee was appointed as a result of a protest campaign launched by us demanding speedy action against the killings. However, the committee did not seem to be strong . The committee report was completed and reportedly handed over to the government. Delaying the actions in spite of having sufficient evidence makes us think that this case is politically motivated?.?
?We are quite sure that the case is held up because the politicians can blackmail the involved powerful characters as long as they conduct the case. The STF should have conducted an internal inquiry on an institution level if they respect the law. Nothing has happened. However, we think the case is not being taken up because of allegations that had already been levelled against the Tri-forces and the STF. In the face of strong public opposition levelled against ?war heroes being summoned and questioned?, the government is reluctant to take up that kind of case where Tri-forces and STF members might be found guilty.?
Members of the previous committee had been told not to disclose the findings freely
?Former Defence Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa is the main suspect of this case. Nothing happened without his orders during that time. They had extreme power by that time. Even though it was illegal, no one was ready to oppose the act which had violated the rules and regulations of the Prisons Act and the fundamental rights of the prisoners.?
?Members of the previous committee had been told not to disclose the findings freely. The witnesses including prison officials were also influenced during the previous government. Some prison officers who witnessed the incident fear for their lives. During the CID inquiry, the CID used to maintain a book to note down the names of the witnesses. We opposed it. Later, the book was removed.?
?
This is a personal revenge?
-Konda Amila?s mother?
Sameera Perera aka ?Konda Amila? was a convict of a drug related crime. He had been brought into Welikada Prison two days prior to the shooting incident.
Jayasinghe Arachchige Malani, the mother of Konda Amila who died during the shooting, had cooked Milk Rice (Kiribath) to celebrate the ?joy? of the news that IP Neomal Rangajeewa of the PNB sustained injuries in a shooting that took place in Piliyandala in May this year. The PNB sleuth is still undergoing treatment at a hospital. ?She said Karma had treated IP Rangajeewa in that way for allegedly killing her son.
?My beloved son knew nothing. I called him around 1 am on November 10, 2012 after the chaos in the prison. I asked him not to go outside the cell or to be involved in any incident and he said yes. But, Rangajeewa had allegedly dragged my son out of the cell and shot him around 6 am,? she claimed.
Malani recalled the history associating her son and the particular prison official at Magazine Prison, Welikada. ?Former Magazine Prison Superintendent Emil Ranjan Lamahewage had punished and penalised my son for possessing a phone in the prison. Following this incident, my son had developed a verbal argument with Emil Ranjan. I had lodged a complaint at the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka against him. My son had been threatened by Emil Ranjan and told to withdraw the complaint. But, my son did not want the complaint to be withdrawn. This is merely a personal revenge,? she alleged.
Karma had treated IP Rangajeewa in that way for allegedly killing my son
Sixty three year old Malani broke down several times while talking about her son.
She said despite attempts to sweep the case under the carpet, the ?killers? of her son and those who gave the order will be punished by the nature some day. ?I cry everyday remembering my son and also I curse those who are responsible for my son?s and others? untimely deaths. I started a small job so that I can direct my attention to something else.
?Otherwise, I would have died or gone mad thinking and crying for my son. Out of my three sons, my elder son died while serving in the Sri Lanka Army. I have only one son now,? she said.
Referring to the Rs. two million of compensation proposed to be given for the family members of the victims of prison massacre, Malani said that she doesn?t want compensation.
Would I be able to get my son back for Rs.2 million she questions? Pledging that she would fight for justice for her son and other dead prisoners, she said that she is ready to appear in court and testify against IP Rangajeewa and former Superintendent Emil Ranjan when the case is taken up again.

Extracts from another eye witness?s account
?
Hewa Dalugodage Sahan Sri Keerthi was in remand at Welikada Prison at the time of riots took place in November, 2012. He was later released. He left the country to save his life as some perpetrators had come to know that he was an eye witness to some of the gruesome killings. He is in poccession of photographic and audio-video evidence. Before going abroad, in the face of threats to his life for being an eye w itness to the incident, he had written an account of what he saw inside the prison where 27 inmates were killed.
After 2 pm
Prison officials were left perturbed as they had nothing else to do, but wait and see the situation which was being handled by the STF.
?
After 4 pm?
Firing of tear gas started around 1.30 pm and lasted for more than one and half hours with no break. Inmates aged more than 70 had been suffering from breathing problems due to tear gas. They had to use water even from fish tanks to recover.?
The situation was so uncontrollable for the main jailer of the prison that he asked prisoners what they should do. The main jailer made an announcement to all inmates saying prison officers and inmates in Welikada had never experienced such cruel treatment during his thirty-year service and he was very disappointed and saddened about what just happened.?
After 8 pm
Prisoners who were on roofs bearing arms had stormed the pharmacy of the prison and consumed drugs. However, inmates remanded for serious criminal cases and those who were having underworld connections tried to hide in cells to save their lives. Those who were branded as thugs and gangsters did not even come out of their cells.?
After 10 pm
Almost all the arms were returned to jailer Kudabanda and inmates were preparing to return to their cells peacefully on the promise that they would be sent to their cells only by prison officials and not by any government forces. Kalu Thushara who was lately shot dead offered huge support to Kudabanda to collect the arms from the inmates. The inmates did no harm to prison officials. Inmates had even helped many jailers to leave the prison premises due to the chaos. They had not used the chaotic situation to escape from the prison.
Jailers called and warned inmates to be careful and be safe as they heard about a come-back by the STF by midnight into the cells.
After 11.45 pm
A rain of bullets were fired suddenly from the main gate. Lester, one of the inmates who was walking towards their cells, was shot repeatedly and he fell right on Kudabanda?s feet. Everyone started fleeing for their lives. Pointing to several prisoners who were hiding under a table including me, Kudabanda asked not to harass us. The forces who did not respect his words, said they had received orders to kill anyone. They separated prison officials and inmates. When leaving, Kudabanda begged the commandoes not to harm any inmate.
?
?
?
?
After 2 am
Army officers came to us with a list of prisoners? and asked their whereabouts. The first inmate they asked about was the one who was remanded for slaying two monks at Kotte Rajamaha Viharaya. Of the names in their list, inmates known as Potta Naufer, Pinwatte Ukkuwa, Ratmalane Rohana and Kapila were there. Few minutes later, we heard Kapila and another inmate named Malan screaming and later they were shot dead.?
Kalu Thushara was among three of us including Sudesh Nandimal Silva, hiding under the table. The commandoes came to us twice and asked whereabouts of Kalu Thushara. As we all saw what happened to other prisoners whom they inquired about and dragged outside, all of us tried to hide. Thushara saved his life. On the third occasion, an officer directly came to Thushara and dragged him out. Thushara was crying and begged them not to shoot him. He said ?sir, I have a child and I am not involved in the drug business anymore?. But, they snatched his life too.
After 9 am
A police team led by a Former Senior DIG visited the prison and took photographs of the dead prisoners. ?He and the team took the arms which were returned to Kudabanda by inmates. The police team kept those arms next to each and every inmate who was killed by them.?
Weeks after ?murders? When the CID officials recording statements from eye witnesses including me, we were asked to comply with what they said and if so, we would be acquitted from all the cases and sent back home. Despite this development we badly wanted to speak and act against the injustice. However, the Rajapaksa rule did not give us a single chance to do so.

Denied air travel because his allegiance was suspect!
	
?
A yahapalanaya deputy from the Puttalam district planned to attend a wedding at the residence of a billionaire friend in the Batticaloa area along with a group of friends from a foreign country.
?
As they wanted to return to Colombo the same evening after attending the wedding, the deputy booked an air force plane for the round trip and made the advance payment as well.?
He also submitted a list of passengers due to travel on his reservation to the air force authorities two days ahead of the date of travel as required. The name of the deputy headed this list.?
Shortly after the submission of the list of passengers, an air force high-up rang up the deputy and told him to cancel the booking as the flight had been disallowed.?
The deputy, flabbergasted on hearing about the cancellation of the flight, challenged their decision saying that he had already paid for the tickets. ?However, his protests were of no avail.?
A highly disconcerted deputy who later made discreet inquiries learnt to his surprise that the air force authorities had received from above a list of persons who should not be allowed the facility of air travel by air force aircraft and his name too appeared on it. He also learnt that this list included the names of Betel leaf Diyawanna members including those at purohita level whose allegiance was under suspicion.?
The deputy then realized that his name too had gone into this ?black list? due to being in the company of the former boss during a recent visit to the country of the Rising Sun.
Of course, the flight was later restored when the deputy withdrew his name from the passenger list. So he finally made it to Batticaloa to attend the wedding by land while the group of friends got there by air. ?

## Title: Dissociative Identity  Disorder- How DID I get there?

Dissociative Identity  Disorder- How DID I get there?
	
?
Previously known as Multiple personality disorder, Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID) is now referred to as a complex psychological condition with at least two split or distinct and relatively enduring identities or dissociated states of personality, alternatively seen in the behaviour of an individual and usually associated with an impairment of memory, particularly on important information, but without any relationship with an ordinary forgetful nature. However, according to the latest research studies, the heart of this disorder does not lie in an individual?s personality but in their memory. ??
For example, someone might walk into a shopping mall to buy clothes for the little one, but seconds later, she will forget how she got to that particular place, becoming completely lost! How devastating that could be? This kind of situation might not be merely due to a transient loss of memory, but related to a condition connected to split personalities. So it is always important to pay attention to any unusual behavioural pattern in our loved ones, as early identification can do miracles. ??
With an incidence of 0.1% to 1% in the general population, DID is caused by various etiological factors like severe trauma during early childhood and extreme repetitive physical, sexual and emotional abuse. These childhood experiences can haunt affected individuals, until proper treatment is found.
?
Patients with split personality
People with DID will also have fragmented identities and characteristic features relating to their own history, identification and mannerisms and have many variable personalities which tend to develop spontaneously on their own. They will also display gestures, postures and behavioural patterns depending on social background, culture, race and ethnicity. In our day-to-day language, we call this ?split personality? and the disorder might not be identified easily, since it is not 100% clinically evident at times. ??
?The three characteristic features which distinguish DID from other personality disorders include ?alters? or different identities (age, sex, or race), ?switching?, where each personality will reveal itself and take control over individual behaviours and thoughts and ?dissociation?, which is a phenomenon where the particular person will start feeling detached from the external environment around them. ??
Also called ?blackout?, this could be the most dreadful phase of DID which can last from seconds to hours, giving rise to overwhelming behaviours and thought patterns. They will also complain of unexplainable gaps in memory or difficulty recalling things they have done previously in their lives, including the recent past. ??
?
When and how to seek medical advice??
DID is a condition which can often go undiagnosed owing to its unclear signs and symptoms which rarely become notable and obvious to others, hence it is important to be aware of the above features in order to seek medical advice when necessary. There are some individuals who try their best to hide their true thoughts and behavioural patterns related to DID, which might make them pressured and tense within, yet give them a high chance of living a happy life for the sake of love and attachment. ??
However, early diagnosis is extremely important to stop people falling prey to secondary mental issues such as depression and anxiety. ??
?
What are the treatment options available ?
Even if there is no permanent cure, long-term treatment modalities including psychotherapy, hypnotherapy and adjunctive therapies are known to play major roles in managing affected patients. However, the main challenge of this treatment would be the identification of their own self and discovering how their systems work, which will definitely help in a better outcome. ??
It is also important to treat underlying mental conditions like depression and anxiety, if diagnosed. ??
Our mind is a beautiful creation and whatever deformities it may have, a brilliant soul can adjust it. Identifying the real situation and working in a way to overcome problems will undoubtedly help improve potential difficulties in achieving happiness. This applies to DID as well. ??

A certain person who once played the country?s envoy in a ?red? country is said to be moving from one country to another without returning home as a court warrant is out for his arrest.
?
However, whenever the former strongman visits a foreign country, this fugitive would rush to his side and pictures showing him in the company of the distinguished visitor would soon appear on the newspapers as well as on the Facebook and other social media web sites.?
This ex-envoy?s recent visit to the country of the Rising Sun had created a stir there when the security authorities discovered that the visitor was a man on the dodge. So about 20 sleuths deployed at the main airport in that country had detained the man when he called there for his departure. When told that he was to be detained as he was under a court warrant, our man had challenged them to produce the court warrant. And that had stumped the security personnel who found themselves sans any official document to justify the detention.
Thereafter, the security authorities in that country had not only released the man, but had also given him a lift to the airport and he had emplaned for his latest destination saying a cheerful ta-ta to them.?

Govt. paid Rs 500m advance to unoccupied building
	
The Government yesterday accepted that it had leased out a building to house the Ministry of Agriculture in 2016 and had paid an advance of Rs. 500 million though it has not been occupied.
These details were revealed by the answer tabled by State Minister of Agriculture Wasantha Aluvihara in response to an oral question raised by Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) MP Dr. Nalinda Jayatissa in Parliament last evening.
The answer said the ministry has not been shifted as the office is yet to be prepared in a suitable manner.
It was also revealed that the government has agreed to pay a monthly rent of Rs 15.07 million and a service charge of Rs. 6.1 million though the government estimate was Rs 13.5 million per month.
Opposition MPs also alleged that the Minister in charge of Agriculture continuously fails to attend Parliament to answer oral questions. (Yohan Perera and Ajith Siriwardana)

Govt. secretly tapping mobile phone: PHU
	
Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) General Secretary MP Udaya Gammanpila on Tuesday charged that the government had imported a device from America which can be used in tapping mobile phone conversations.
MP Gammanpila told a news conference that during the election period President Maithripala Sirisena had claimed in his manifesto that ?Rajapaksa government? had tapped telephone conversations of their opponents and vowed that he would not do so once their government came into power.
?During the period of former president Mahinda Rajapaksa, facilities were only available in tapping land line phone conversations. There should be at least 100 metres of close distance in order to tap mobile phone conversations at that time,? he said.
He said the local agent of this tapping device was a company named N-Able in Bristol Street, Colombo.
He also said the devise that they bought down to tap mobile phone conversations could only be used if the telecommunication company would be allowed to do so.
?They have to allow the person to connect to their network or provide encryption code to tap into phones. The government cannot secretly listen to conversation without the support of the telecommunication companies,? he said.
He said that they had received these information since they had kept an eye on the spies attached to this issue and added that they would reveal the facts if any telecommunication company would have supported in this unethical act.
He said they were acting against this move since it was against the people?s mandate obtained by the government. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)

He breezed in full of confidence and stormed out in disgust
	
?
A firebrand Green party deputy from the Colombo district who wanted to meet a same party purohita representing a district in the deep South called at the latter?s Ministry the other day.
?
By the way, this deputy waged a big battle within the party some time ago to promote the image of this purohita in a bid elevate him to a high rank in the party. ?
When this deputy called at the Ministry, an office aide told him to sit in the visitors? lounge for a while as the purohita was busy. The deputy waited for about half an hour and finding no summons forthcoming, stormed into the purohita?s office.
The deputy, now angry at being cold-shouldered, briefly stated his business and asked the purohita to do the needful given his personal interest in the matter. The purohita who quietly listened to the deputy told him that he had to call for a report before he could move in the matter.?
The deputy, however, insisted that the purohita should act using his discretion and authority, given the urgency of the matter. But the purohita stood his ground saying that he had to follow the usual formalities before taking any concrete action. The deputy appealed again, but his onetime ?hero? remained unmoved. ?An exasperated deputy walked out vowing never to see the purohita again, not before berating him in choice Sinhala and dashing the file he was carrying on the floor, they say.

Newly-appointed Army Commander Mahesh Senanayake, who fled the country in 2010 while in service citing political reasons and re-joined the army in 2015 said yesterday he was ?not a victim of politics but a victim of circumstances?.
?I was clearly a victim of circumstances, but certainly not a victim of politics. I have never done politics in my life,? he told the media soon after assuming duties as the 22nd Army Commander.
Explaining the reason for fleeing the country, the Commander said, ?I was advised by my lawyers to leave the country because of the political situation at that time, so I left.?
Commenting on the war crimes allegations against the officers and the soldiers, Lt. Gen. Senanayake said as an institution, the army would give its fullest cooperation to any investigations.
?I don?t know whether those accusing the army officers and soldiers have first-hand information about their allegations; whether they were there at that time or not, but if there are any investigations we will certainly support it to clear the name and reputation of the army,? he said.
The Army Commander said he hoped to get information from officers and soldiers, who were there during the war as well as those who expert knowledge about the area and legal experts to gather more information about those allegations.
He said currently there were no internal investigations on those ?war crimes? allegations.
Commenting, on reports about a possible threat from the ISIS on Sri Lanka, the Commander said, ?at the moment, no such threat has been brought to our notice?. He said that all tri-service personnel, the Police and the intelligence agencies of the country were capable of tackling any such issues.
The Commander said he had identified several areas in the army that should be addressed and rejected claims that the activities of the military intelligence unit had been curtailed in the recent past. ?The military intelligence unit is operative functioning efficiently,? he added. (Sunil Jayasiri)
