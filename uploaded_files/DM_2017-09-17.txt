Govt. conspiring to postpone PC election: Gammanpila
	
Joint opposition MP Udaya Gammanpila today accused the government of conspiring to further postpone the Provincial Council (PC) elections by debating the Provincial Council Election.
Amendment Bill instead of the 20 Amendment on Wednesday (20) while also planning to introduce a new amendment to the Bill which would determine the electoral system to be used to hold the PC elections.
He said even though media had reported that the government would drop the 20th Amendment and go for the Provincial Council election since the Supreme Court had determined the 20th Amendment should be referred to the people at a referendum for approval, it had found a new strategy to further delay the PC election as they fear they will lose if polls were held now.

The government has found a new strategy to delay the PC polls even more. There is a Bill pending called PC Elections Amendment Bill which secures minimum 30% representation for women in the Provincial Councils. Instead of the 20 A, the government intends to put this Bill up for debate on Wednesday (20). Then during the committee stage of the debate, they are going to introduce a new Amendment to the Bill which will decide on the electoral system to be used for the PC election.

Mr. Gammanpila said by doing so the government would be able to further postpone the PC election. This is a conspiracy. This is against the constitution because according to article 78 of the constitution, before a Bill is debated and is approved in Parliament the government has a duty to gazette it at least two weeks prior to tabling it in Parliament. That is to give the people an opportunity to express their views and challenge it before the Supreme Court if they think it to be unconstitutional. If they introduce new material during the committee stage, people will be denied the opportunity to express their views as well as challenge it before the Supreme Court, he said.
He said according to the constitution, if an amendment is moved in Parliament during the committee stage the Attorney General should certify the constitutionality of the amendment and submit it to the Speaker.
He said the Attorney General was duty-bound to inform the speaker that this kind of amendment was against the constitution but he acted with bias and in an unconstitutional manner certifying that the amendment brought in to the Local Government elections (Amendment) Bill which denied field officers the right to contest the LG polls.
He said they would move a resolution against the Attorney General to remove him from his office, if he was going to neglect his constitutional duty and act with bias towards the government. There is an Act called the Removal of Officers Special Provisions Act of 2002 which specifies that if the Attorney General or IGP acts in an unconstitutional or biased manner, Parliament can remove him by passing a resolution, he said.

Govt.s claims, ICPAPD non-retrospective false: NFF
	
National Freedom Front (NFF) spokesman Mohammed Muzammil said today the government was attempting to betray the security forces and mislead the people by saying the Bill on the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearances (ICPAPED) would not applicable to the past.
He told a news conference that even though it was true that laws passed in parliament were not applicable to the past, that did not apply to internationals laws and conventions, according to Article 13(6) of the Constitution.
In the case against Sepala Ekanayake who hijacked a plane, Supreme Court ruled that the Offenses Against aircraft Act No. 24 of 1982 could be applicable to the past as it had been enacted based on three International Conventions though Mr. Ekanayakes attorney, Colvin R. de Silva argued that he could not be prosecuted because hijacking of planes was not a criminal offence in Sri Lanka at the time incident occurred. So it is clear that our Constitution has provisions to allow laws based on International Conventions to be applicable to the past, Mr. Muzammil said.
He said under this Convention, anyone involved in incidents that took place after 1992 could be prosecuted because this convention was signed in 1992 and added that anyone connected to incidents in 1989 could not be prosecuted.
Mr. Muzammil said only 57 countries out of 193 had signed this Convention and added that the enactment of this Bill in Sri Lanka would leave room for the security forces to get trapped in the international net.
He requested all SLFP ministers in the government to oppose this move. (Ajith Siriwardana)

Lankan in UK jailed for killing wife's lover
	
A jealous Sri Lankan husband who beat his estranged wife's new boyfriend to death after kidnapping him in Milton Keynes was jailed for life with a minimum of sentence of 18 years.
Gnanachandran Balachandran, 38, was incensed when he discovered his wife Ragupathy Annalingham was seeing another man.
The Sri Lanken Tamil, who was granted asylum in 1999, organised the abduction of Suren Sivananthan, 32, from the Secklow Gate shopping area near Milton Keynes Theatre on the afternoon of Friday 20 January 2017.
For 12 hours, Suren was held captive, plied with alcohol and beaten in three different locations. He suffered 87 sites of injury. Two head injuries were the cause of his death.
The body of Suren, who normally lived in Canada, was left on the ground in sub-zero temperatures outside a parade of shops in Great Linford.
Last month a jury at Luton crown court found Balachandran, from The Fleet, Springfield in Milton Keynes, guilty of murder.
Judge Richard Foster jailed him for life ordering that he serve a minimum sentence of 18 years less 213 days spent on remand.
A 17-year-old accomplice, who is too young to be named for legal reasons, was also convicted of murder and was sentenced to custody for life with a minimum term of 11 years less 151 days spent on remand and qualifying curfew.
Prashanth Thevarasa, 24, of Farrier Place, Downs Barn, Milton Keynes, was acquitted of Mr Sivananthan's murder and an alternative charge of manslaughter, but found guilty of causing him grievous bodily harm with intent. He was sentenced to 10 years.
Judge Foster described Balachandran as a "strong and dominant personality" who one witness described as a bully.
He said he did not accept that Suren was 'just a friend.'
During the trial the jury heard the husband had been watching Ragupathy's every move.
She and Suren had been trying to keep their relationship a secret from the local Sri Lankan community in Milton Keynes, but on the day of the abduction they had gone to the shopping centre together. When he went to a shop on his own he was grabbed.
Hours later, Suren's body was discovered outside a parade of shops in Great Linford, Milton Keynes.
The wife told the court that at one point while Suren was being held captive by the group she spoke to him.
She said he sounded as if he was in pain, telling the jury: "He told me in Tamil 'Everyone's beating me up.' He didn't know where he was and the call ended."
Suren stayed with Ragupathy at her home in Milton Keynes from January 10 this year and was due to fly back to Canada on Saturday January 21, the day he died.
David Bentley QC, defending the husband, said: "There is no evidence it was pre-planned." He said his client came from a troubled background and had been granted asylum in this country in 1999.
Martin Rutherford QC for the 17-year-old said he had been in the UK for 5 years and had lived in foster care. He had no previous convictions.(ITV News)

More power failures could be expected island wide from tomorrow as the union had withdrawn their crew from the Laxapana Hydro Power Station, Ceylon Electricity Employees Union (CEEU) Secretary Ranjan Jayalal said today.
Mr. Jayalal said the people would be further inconvenienced from tomorrow as the demand for electricity on weekdays usually high.
He said that the authorities are playing all the cards that they have to get the employees to work but none of them would report for work until their demands were granted unconditionally.
Meanwhile, Power and Renewable Energy Minister Ranjith Siyambalapitiya today urged the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) employees to report for duty from tomorrow and said they would be granted paid leave for September 14 and 15, the two days they had stopped work.
He said he had instructed the officials to grant two days' paid leave those on strike.
According to union leaders they have no issue with the ministry or me. Since electricity directly impacts the countrys economy I request all employees to return to work, the minister added.
It was reported householders in several areas had experienced power failures because of the work stoppage and that traders were also inconvenienced because of food stored in refrigerators being spoiled because of the power failures .
Also the hospitals and other essential services were inconvenienced due to the work stoppage of the CEB employees from Wednesday (13). (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
