America will finally catch up with 1960 Sri Lanka: Stephen Colbert
	
Hillary Clinton could be the first female president and America will finally catch up with 1960 Sri Lanka, said Late Show host Stephen Colbert.
Stephen Colbert, on Tuesdays post-DNC Convention show, celebrated Hillary Clintons breaking the penultimate glass ceiling to become the first woman to receive the nomination of a major political party.
Colbert noted that Clintons historic achievement marks the end of the line for runner-up Bernie Sanders.
If youre a supporter of Bernie, you should be proud, he said. So many of the things that you fought for are now in the Democratic Party platform  fifteen-dollar minimum wage, overturning Citizens United, claiming your Hacky Sack as a dependent. Its all in there.
This means Hillary Clinton could be the first female president, said Colbert. And America will finally catch up with 1960 Sri Lanka.

European banks prepare for possible shockwaves from stress test results
	
Europes biggest banks are braced for the outcome of financial health checks that could expose the extent of the weaknesses of the worlds oldest bank, Monte dei Paschi di Siena (MPS), and send shockwaves through the markets.
However, the tests  due to be published on Friday  are being viewed by some analysts as a missed opportunity to gauge the full extent of the fragility of the banking system in Europe. Only 51 banks are being assessed, compared with 124 in 2014, and they will not be given a pass or fail mark as in the past.
Of the 51 banks being tested by the EU-wide European Banking Authority, only MPS failed two years ago. We think it is a missed opportunity that the EBA 2016 stress tests will not be used to do a fuller and deeper health check of the banking system in Europe. This is especially the case as in some countries the smaller banks are the least sound. A case could have been made to include more banks rather than less, said Tomas Kinmonth, an analyst at Dutch bank Abn Amro. The fate of the Italian banks is being closely watched. Italy could provide the watershed moment for European banks. If a banking crisis were to start in Italy, we believe it would spread throughout Europe with the more levered names in the sector bearing the brunt of the pressure, said analysts at Berenberg.

FCID names Namal, five others over Hello Corp transaction
	
The FCID-on a directive of Attorney General had today named Namal Rajapaksa and five others as suspects over purchasing shares of Hello Corp. using ill-gotten funds of Gowers Corporation, which is headed by Mr. Rajapaksa.
The FCID filing a B report informed court that the suspect Namal Rajapaksa had dealt with a company named Boston and had given Rs. 15 million and another Rs.30 million through one Indika Karunajeewa to the Chairman of that company, Mr. Rohan Abey Iriyagolla.
Then according to the statements got from the chairman of the Boston Co., the given money was paid to Gowers and NR Consultants again, which are headed by Namal Rajapaksa, as payments for the services obtained by Boston.
The two transactions were found by the prosecution as offences that fell under the Money Laundering Act.
The other suspects, Indika Prabath Karunajeewa, Pavithra Sujani Bogollagama, Nithya Senani Samaranayake, Sudarsha Bandara Ganegoda and Iresha Silva were named as suspects over conspiring to commit the offences that fell under the Money Laundering and the Penal Code, by the FCID.
Acceding the prosecution request, Additional Magistrate Nishantha Peiris issued an arrest warrant on second suspect Indika Karunajeewa, since the suspect currently resides abroad, absconding the prosecution.
The Magistrate had also observed that the prosecution has the authority to arrest suspects under the Money Laundering Act without further permission from the court.
The FCID also said court that the prosecution would file two cases separately over the alleged two transactions against the suspects.
Further inquiry was postponed to September 1. (Shehan Chamika Silva)

New UK visit visa application form launched in SL
	
As part of a global rollout, a new visa application form, Access UK, has launched in Sri Lanka for customers applying for a UK visit visa, the British High Commission in Colombo announced.
The new form will make it quicker and easier for customers to apply for their UK visa. Benefits include:
-A shorter form, with questions logically ordered based on customer feedback
-More local languages, although customers will need to provide their answers in English
-The application fee is displayed in the correct local currency
-Customers can apply, book their Visa Application Centre (VAC) appointment to give biometrics, and pay for the relevant service standard seamlessly
-The service is available on mobile devices
-The form can pre-populate a Schengen Visa application form which customers can then download and print. This makes it much easier for customers applying for both visas at the same time.
Following the successful launch of Access UK in China in June 2014, UKVI is rolling it out globally to customers applying for a Standard Visitor Visa, Visitor (Marriage & Civil Partnership), or Visitor (Permitted Paid Engagement) Visa, it said.
To make it more straightforward for customers, Access UK will soon be rolled out in Hindi, Tamil, Gujarati and Bengali, with a roll-out of more languages planned.
Access UK is available at www.gov.uk/apply-uk-visa. However the Visa4UK website will continue to be available for visitors and for applicants applying visas on other routes, the statement added.
UK Visas & Immigration Regional Director for South and Southeast Asia, Nick Crouch said:
The UK remains committed to improving the visa service for customers and making it quicker and easier for customers to apply for UK visas.
The new form, known as Access UK, successfully launched in China in 2014 and received excellent feedback from customers. We have further refined it and are now rolling it out globally. We look forward to hearing further feedback on the form, and hope that it will encourage more customers from Sri Lanka to visit the UK.
British High Commissioner to Sri Lanka James Dauris said:
The strong relationship between the UK and Sri Lanka is built on people to people links, including through business relationships and cultural exchange. The UK welcomes genuine visa applications and the new Access UK form will make the process of applying for a business or tourist visa quicker and easier.

Port City Project- Two more hectares in lieu of losses incurred
	
The Government is reported to have proposed the allocation of two more hectares of land to the Port City Project to off-set loss of US$143 million caused by the suspension of work after the new government assumed office.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has submitted separate Cabinet papers outlining plans for the resumption of the project and the reclaiming of a landmass of 262 hectares from the sea adjoining the Colombo Port.
The project was launched by the Rajapaksa Government in 2014. Later, the new government suspended the project saying it needed to be reviewed but later decided to go ahead based on a fresh agreement.
CHEC Port City Colombo (Pvt) Ltd which is handling the project claimed compensation for the loss caused by the suspension resulting in financial losses, cost of staff retrenchment, losses due to price fluctuations, financial charges by banks, etc.
The company estimated the loss incurred at US$134 millions as at March 23 this year, according the document circulated among the Cabinet Ministers. However, the Committee of Secretaries, appointed to negotiate with the company, has proposed to find alternative ways to off-set the loss instead of any cash payment.
According to the original agreement 20 hectares were to be given to the company on a freehold basis and the balance on a 99-year lease. However, the new government decided do away with the freehold basis and instead offer it on a 99-year lease. After the lapse of 99-year lease period the lessee will have the right to lease out the land to a third party on another 99-year lease.
Instead of the Sri Lanka Ports Authority, the Urban Development Authority (UDA) will be in charge of the land to allocated to the government with the Ministry of Megapolis, the UDA and the Project Company signing the tripartite agreement for the resumption of operations.
The reclaimed land will be gazetted as parts of the Colombo district. (Kelum Bandara)

Members of the SLFP who participate in the Pada Yatra today will be considered to be traitors, Southern Province Chief Minister Shan Wijayalal De Silva said yesterday.
The Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) requests all party members not to participate in todays Pada Yatra. Participating in the Pada Yatra will be an unforgivable offence, he said. Pada Yatras are not a new phenomenon in the country. We have many records of people conducting similar Pada Yatras in history.
We have seen similar moments take place at the end of public campaigns such as victory rallies, but on this occasion it is being used as a starting point of their programme, CM Wijayalal said.
Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa and the Joint Opposition leadership threw away their power and the two third majority they enjoyed by calling for a premature election. He directly ordered the Elections Commissioner to conduct the Presidential elections prematurely, and this is why he lost. Its out of frustration that they are trying to influence people by conducting this Pada Yatra, he said.
If he had not called for elections and stayed in power as he was entitled to, he would still be President and would not need to go on such processions as Pada Yatras, Wijayalal said. (Chaturanga Pradeep)

Will seek more help from India to develop health sector: PM
	
Sri Lanka will seek more Indian assistance to develop its health sector including the indigenous medicine sector, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said today.
Speaking at the inauguration of the emergency pre-hospital care ambulance service at the Galle Face Green in Colombo, the Prime Minister said Indian assistance could be extended towards the indigenous medicine sector as well.
We will seek more assistance from India to develop the health sector. India has already assured construction of two hospitals in Sri Lanka. Sri Lanka will obtain dialysis machines from India. We should remember that indigenous medicine came to Sri Lanka from India. We can use India as a role model for the development of indigenous medicine and launch an Indo-Lanka joint programme to develop indigenous medicine, he said.
The Prime Minister said in the Sri Lankan vocabulary helping the sick is a meritorious deed.
"Therefore what we have seen today is such a deed. This meritorious deed has been performed by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. I asked him whether India could assist Sri Lanka to start up a pre-hospital care ambulance service. He obliged immediately, he said adding that the biggest meritorious deed according to Buddhism and Hinduism was looking after the sick.
The Prime Minister recalled that the Sri Lankan people were engaged in business with India long before the Indo-Lanka trade pact came into being.
The ancient kings did not prohibit trade pacts with India. If there was a prohibition, Tappasu and Balluka would have not come to Sri Lanka. One should be aware of all these factors and make use of Indo Lanka relations, he stressed. Finally he said those who criticized the pre emergency care ambulance service today would praise it in the near future. (Yohan Perera)
