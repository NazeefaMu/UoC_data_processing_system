MRIA makes hay while BIA undergoes renovations
	
The Mattala Rajapaksa International Airport (MRIA) has become busier with at least five flights using the airport daily, a far cry from the one flight which used the air port during the past year.
MRIA manager Upul Kalansuriya said the airport had at least 400 passengers each day since the closure of the main Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA) in January 6, for renovations.
The main runway at the BIA will remain closed during the day until April for the construction of two new runways. the main runway of the airport would be closed for eight hours each day, from 8.30 am to 4.30 pm, for three months.
MRIA was opened in March 2013. Initially, several airlines flew to the airport, including SriLankan Airlines which established a hub. However, due to low demand, most of these airlines left Mattala.
Kalansuriya said that 240 flights had used the airport bringing in 14,000 passengers since January this year.
Airlines Fly Dubai and Indonesia had flights arriving and departing from MRIA, flights to Beijing and Shanghai only departed from the airport, he said.
?We have the facilities to cater to these travellers and the crew. The number of travellers arriving and departing from MRIA is increasing as we speak,? he said. (Darshana Sanjeewa)

The Government intends to go in for a referendum with the consent of all parties including the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) on the new Constitution, Leader of the House Lakshman Kiriella told Parliament today.
He came out with this remark when joint opposition MP Wimal Weerawansha questioned about a statement made by Foreign Affairs Minister Mangala Samaraweera that the government would go for a process of devolution of power.
The MP claimed the minister had made such a statement to the foreign media.
Mr. Kiriella said the government will not go for federalism while Parliament's approval would be sought for all aspects of the constitution including the devolution of power.

New Constitution most potent weapon for non-recurrence of war: Mangala
	
A new Constitution is the most potent weapon for non-recurrence of Sri Lanka?s conflict and would have to be given priority over accountability mechanisms, Foreign Affairs Minister Mangala Samaraweera has said.
The country, which suffered two youth insurrections and a 26-year-long war, had seen enough violence and bigotry, and needed checks and balances to ensure that the road ahead is peaceful, he told Colombo-based foreign correspondents on Wednesday.
According to the Hindu, Minister Samaraweera had assured that the government was committed to drafting a new Constitution that would pave the way for reconciliation.
?Some people pull it backward even as others push it forward... but the government will certainly do it? he said.
Amid mounting criticism from sections of the Tamils and civil society on the pace of reconciliation, he admitted the government had not proceeded as fast as it ought to have. However, assuring that ?there will be no U-turns, [although] there could be some detours,? he said, the ?destination remains the same?.
Terming accountability the more ?controversial? element in reconciliation, Mr. Samaraweera indicated that Sri Lanka would seek more time at the coming UN Human Rights Council session in Geneva, to take its efforts forward.
The country was looking at different models of accountability and was in ?no great hurry?, as the processes were complex and needed time to ensure it is acceptable to all stakeholders.
In regard to participation of foreign judicial experts in investigation of alleged war crimes, he said: ?The [Geneva] resolution speaks of participation of foreign experts at different levels but Sri Lanka is committed to come up with something independent and credible.?

The joint opposition yesterday claimed that the Monday night shooting incident in which the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) escaped unhurt was staged.
SAITM CEO Dr. Sameera Senarathne escaped unhurt when his car allegedly came under fire by two men travelling on a motorcycle wearing full-face helmets while he was leaving the SAITM premises in Malabe.
Addressing a news conference MP Jayantha Samaraweera said none of the CCTV cameras in the vicinity of the crime were operative at the time of the shooting.
?This raises serious suspicions about the entire incident,? he said.

Establishing of the private medical university-SAITM ?was a great effort done by the former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, Special Assignments Minister Dr. Sarath Amunugama said today.
Addressing media at the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) weekly press briefing at the SLFP Headquarters, Dr. Amunugama said the SLFP should be thankful to Mr. Rajapaksa for introducing the private medical universities to the country and it was a wise move that he had ever taken.
?The protests against the SAITM are not a practical thing according to our view. If there are issues on standards we should hold discussions and solve the issues. The standards what they seeking from SITAM, should have applicable to our State universities as well.
The initial loan of Rs. 600 mn for SITAM was issued by a State bank. Therefore, it is not a good thing for protesting against issuing the birth certificate to the child because it was born during the previous regime,? the Minister said.
?MRIA, Mattala Port and Highways were built to show his leadership and he didn?t build them to operate in isolation but to help convert Hambantota region as an investment industrial zone.
?The purpose of those projects was to help our manufacturers export their finished products to international markets easily,? he said.
?It is unfortunate to hear that Mr. Rajapaksa is now denying all the constructions he had done,? he said.
?Not having the power doesn?t mean that the country had fallen. MRIA, Mattala Port and Super Highways do not vaporize if Mr. Rajapaksa is not in power. All those projects and constructions can be used by any one and credit goes to him,? he said. (Chaturanga Pradeep)

SLMC has no option than accepting SAITM now: Kiriella
	
The government yesterday said the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) has no option other than accepting SAITM as a fully qualified private medical college now that the Court of Appeal has given a clear ruling in favour of it.
Higher Education and Highways Minister Laxaman Kiriella told the weekly cabinet news briefing in Parliament that the government would fully honour the Court of Appeal ruling on the South Asia Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) issue and intervene to provide full facilities at State hospitals for medical students of SAITM to undergo clinical training as giving clinical training to SAITM students was the crux of the protest by the GMOA and medical students of State medical colleges.
?I am glad that the Court of Appeal has given a ruling on this issue ordering the SLMC to identify SAITM as a medical degree awarding institution and accept medical degrees offered by SAITM. But if the President of the SLMC Dr. Carlo Fonseka agrees to my request to give SAITM students provisional registration in order to arrive to a peaceful settlement to the SAITM controversy, no one would have been in this predicament today,? Minister Kiriella said.
Minister Kiriella added that the SAITM students must also sit the Act 16 examination like any other medical student who obtains an MBBS degree from any medical college other than a government medical college to maintain the quality and standard of the medical profession.
The Court of Appeal judgement is very clear that the SAITM students have a right to get provisional registration by SLMC and therefore, it is the responsibility of the Ministry of Health to provide clinical training facilities to SAITM medical students because they are also our own children. They have missed the medical college entrance not because of their fault but due to the District Ratio. That is why a student in Colombo fails to enter medical college even with three ?A? passes at the GCE A/L while a student in Monaragala enters the medical college with two B passes and a C pass.
?Is it a crime to give an opportunity to our own student to study at a private medical college, obtain proper clinical training and experience and pass the MBBS and obtain provision registration at the SLMC?? Minister Kirielle asked.
Minister Kiriella said the Higher Education Ministry would set up two more medical faculties in Rajarata and Wayamba Universities shortly to train more doctors and give permits to open foreign universities that offer IT, Engineering, Accountancy and Medical degrees.
Don?t forget that it was a UNP government that introduced free education to the country and therefore we have no intention whatsoever to weaken free education. But we must go forward with demands of the free world and requirements of the modern society. There are vast opportunities for new vistas of education and we must look at them in a positive mind but not with malice, hate and vengeance, Minister Kiriella stressed.
He said if any one is against the opportunity given to SAITM he or she must appeal to the Supreme Court settle the issue there and until then the government consider SAITM is a duly established medical degree awarding institute and its students have a right to apply for provisional registration at SLMC.

## Title: Decolonisation of church architecture in Sri Lanka

Decolonisation of church architecture in Sri Lanka
	
?
The decolonisation of church architecture in Sri Lanka needs to be understood within the context of nationalist movements that emerged in the late 19th century. It is noted that the reformist movements, particularly the Buddhist revivalists, radically influenced the process of indigenisation of the colonial church. For instance, there have been some genuine efforts, especially on the part of the Anglican Church, to become an indigenous faith as early as the 1930s when the word ?Anglican? was dropped and it began to call itself as ?The Church of Ceylon? as an autonomous local church.?
According to Anoma Peiris, since the architectural dimension of colonial period church buildings had been neoclassical in style with no pretensions of a context or identity of the country, the rising challenge of Buddhism during the early years of anti?colonial nationalism produced an exemplary shift towards an indigenised expression in church architecture. The pressure against Christianity led to the adaptation of Buddhist architectural forms for both Protestant and Catholic churches. On the other hand, the pressure of criticism against the Christians in Sri Lanka had increased with the growing strength of the nationalist discourse and an effort needed to be made in support of their endeavour. As a result, the influence of nationalism came in the 1930s in the form of religious architecture. The very first structures that chose to make this statement were the chapels of Teacher Training College (1920) in Peradeniya and Trinity College (1935) in Kandy.?
The specific form that inspired for the Trinity College Chapel was a colonnaded hall that existed in several examples of traditional architecture of historic eras. The forest of fifty stone pillars standing on a high stone podium closely resembled the king?s Audience Hall in Kandy. In doing so, it created a building that was far closer to the pre-colonial cultural experience of the society. The entire wall behind the altar is transformed by a life-size mural of the crucifixion. The theme of the murals, though biblical in inspiration, was always represented in a localised context with local people as its models which further indigenised the interior. Anoma Peiris writes whereas previously stained-glass windows had been imported from Europe, from this period onwards, local artists began to paint scenes based on indigenous themes inside churches. They used local fisherfolk or indigenous plants and landscapes for their inspiration. Moreover, the use of local material such as timber and brass, particularly for the tabernacle, and the application of motifs typically found in Buddhist temples, further indigenised the churches.?
The sway of post-political independence?
The initiatives taken by the ?Christian nationalists? with the authority of priests greatly influenced the church architecture of the island. It can be noticed that during this period, ?indigenisation of colonial expression? had become a necessity; many of the new churches deliberately adopted the forms of Buddhist and Hindu aesthetics. As Shanthikumar Hettiarachchi points out, these attempts to become indigenous ecclesial communities rather than churches planted in the manner and style of their ?mother church? in Europe or elsewhere, developed a praxis that led to relations with other national movements. Once again, the Anglican Church led the process of indigenisation as an ecclesial priority in several projects. The continuation of preceding architectural experiments of the Anglicans were demonstrated in their cathedrals of ?Christ the King? (1960) in Kurunegala and ?Christ the Living Saviour? (1973) in Colombo.?
Most of the architectural details of the Cathedral of Christ the King, Kurunegala have been inspired by the traditional architecture of the Anuradhapura, Polonnaruwa and Kandyan periods. The main feature of the superstructure of the building is the Buddhist Octagon. Another noteworthy detail is the arches found in the building as in the Lankathilaka Temple. Following the Hindu concept of Vimana, the altar of the cathedral is placed within the highest part of the building. The roof of this sacred area has been constructed as an octagon structure to resemble the form of ?Paththirippuwa? of the Temple of Tooth Relic in Kandy.?
The apex of architectural experiments of this movement is seen in the Cathedral of Christ the Living Saviour in Colombo. Although the architectural form of the cathedral is reminiscent of a Buddhist temple, it goes a step further and attempts to give a contemporary statement of Christian sacred space and a rationale for the process of indigenisation within the context of architecture. An effort has been made to make the building an open place. The slope of the floor downwards towards the sanctuary suggests the glory of God who came down to earth to dwell among the people. Therefore, the bishop, priests and people are all seated at the same level. The communion table has been placed in a central position to receive a great prominence in the building, suggesting the incarnation of Jesus Christ in the midst of the people. The entire building looks unfinished. It is by design in order to constantly remind the faithful of the unfinished task accomplishing the journey of the mission.?
?
The renewal of Second Vatican Council?
The decolonisation of church architecture in Sri Lanka also coincided with the rejuvenation of the Second Vatican Council in the 1970s, and created more opportunities to the Catholic Church to extend and continue architectural experiments like their counterparts in the immediate pre-Vatican period. The council recommends that the Church should everywhere become a ?native Church? integrated into the national cultures and it also advocates a wholesome feeling for the country, while it warns of excessive nationalism. In terms of re-modelling and re-furnishing of church interiors, from this period onwards traditional arts and crafts like colourful Lacquer and Batik work have adorned the wooden facets on crosses, communion rails and candlesticks.?
The Votive Basilica of Our Lady of Lanka (1974) in Ragama can be seen as a precedent for the architectural programme which was sandwiched between the post-colonial Sri Lanka and the world of Vatican II. In that sense, the dedication of the Basilica is significant; it was consecrated under the title of ?Our Lady of Lanka.? Na flower (Mesua ferrea), another national symbol of Sri Lanka, was incorporated to the statue of Our Lady of Lanka. From an architectural perspective, it was intended to meet the requirements of combining ecclesiastical tradition with oriental architecture. However, the original plan tended to be more weighted on the side of Indian traditions, particularly the ?Chaitya Salawa? model.?
As an ending note, the decolonisation process of church architecture in Sri Lanka must be viewed as a history of a marginal tradition with colonial origins and relations. It can be perceived that these cross-cultural architectural adaptations occurred without much awareness and reflection on these Hindu-Buddhist symbolisms. Post-colonial critics like Shanthikumar Hettiarachchi reasons Christian thinkers and leaders of that period ? had no pre-colonial perception of the self-understanding of Christianity, except to accept a colonial construction of Christian expression. It is for this reason that a process of indigenisation was imperative as the churches lacked a pre-colonial body of knowledge and a possibility of an indigenous Christianity, as in the case of Indian experience of an indigenised Christianity of the St. Thomas tradition. It is regretted that during this period, local churches in Sri Lanka had lost the opportunity to experiment with a local style of Christian architectural tradition, more importantly to situate the Christian understanding of sacred time and space within the context of building techniques which have been evolved to suit local environmental conditions.?
