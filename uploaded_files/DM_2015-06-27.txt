## Title: Commercial High Courts in disarray

Commercial High Courts in disarray
	
The Commercial High Court, the only court which has jurisdiction into specialized areas of Law in the island, is in complete disarray, following the shuffling of judges at least 5 times during the past six months.
As a result cases heard before the judges have been transferred and re-transferred to and from different courts and different judges in accordance with the sporadic changes made.
The Court has exclusive jurisdiction into matters related to Company Law and Intellectual Property Law. Apart from this the court hears matters pertaining to Admiralty law, Debt Recoveries by banks and all commercial transactions worth over 5 million rupees in the Western Province.
The Commercial High Court of the Country comprises three branches- named as Commercial High Court 1, 2, and 3 respectively.
The Court is considered to be a pivotal point of swift and efficient administration of justice, as Commercial transactions are often dependent on stringent time factors.
Lawyers and litigants of the Commercial High Court expressed dismay at the mode on which the judges were shifted in rapid succession.
Many cases have been partially heard by one judge and then suddenly it was move to another judge in January this year. Then after some hearings now the same has been shifted to another judge. Some of the cases have to be heard all over again and every case has suffered long delays" litigants said.
Earlier Justice L.T.B Dehideniya was sitting in Court number 1 of the three branch court. Mr. Aruna Ranasinghe was sitting judge in Court number 2 and Mr. Amendra Senevirathne was presiding over court number 3.
The shifting of judges commenced this year with the promotion of High Court Judge L.T.B Dehideniya as a judge of the Court of Appeal on January 30.
Mr. Ruwan Fernando thereafter assumed duties as the judge of Commercial High Court 3. Mr. Aruna Ranasinghe who was previously sitting in Commercial Court 2 was transferred to fill in the vacancy left by Justice Dehideniyas promotion, as Judge of High Court 1.
The vacancy was filled after a lapse of close to three weeks since the promotion of Justice Dehideniya.
Mr. Amendra Senevirathne who was sitting in Court number 3, was transferred to Court number 2.
Following the transfers all cases were assigned and re- assigned causing delay, confusion and procedural dilemmas.
Escalating the prevalent confusion - sitting judge of Court number 1, Aruna Ranasinghe was transferred out of the Commercial High Courts in early June. Mr. E.G.A.R Amarasekara was appointed in his place thereafter.
Mr. Ruwan Fernando, who was hearing all cases in High Court number 3, was also transferred out of the Commercial High Court on the June 19th. All cases heard before Mr Fernando were then again re- transferred to Mr. Amendra Senevirathne who was re- reappointed as judge of Court 3 having previously been transferred from Court number 3 to Court number 2.
Mr. Shiran Gunarathne was appointed as Judge of High Court number 2 on June 22nd, taking over from Mr. Amendra Senevirathne.
The entire issue has taken a further step following the appointment of Mr. Gunarathne as a Judge of the Trial-at-Bar appointed to hear the case in which MP Duminda Silva and others have been indicted.
Mr. Amendra Senevirathne who is a sitting judge at the High Court, is also a member of the Trial-at-Bar hearing the murder case involving former DIG. Vass Gunawardena.
The appointment of Mr. Senevirathne as a judge of the Trial-at-Bar, who is also a member of a Presidential Commission has also been a cause of concern for litigants, as many cases have been postponed owing to the Trial-at-Bar and other official duties he has been assigned apart from his duties on the Commercial Court.
Litigants fear the same predicament would follow when the Duminda Silva trial commences.
Earlier, the High Court of Civil Appeal in the Western Province faced the same issue following the promotion of Justice Lyonne Senevirathne. The Appointments were filled after a lapse of close to two months, with cases which were to be heard during the hiatus being postponed for months.
Minister of Justice Wijedasa Rajapaksa PC said that the transfers do not fall within the scope of the Ministry.
" The sole and exclusive authority for these transfers is vested with the Judicial Services Commission headed by the Chief Justice. The Ministry has no link to it. The JSC is a completely independent body headed by the Chief Justice and it is they who are in charge of these transfers" he said.
President of the Bar Association of Sri Lanka Geoffrey Alagarathnam PC said that they have raised the issue with the Chief Justice.
We have made representations regarding this to the Chief Justice. It has resulted in the disruption of work. But there are practical problems that those appointing have faced which has led to this. We are making representations and following this up" he told Daily Mirror.
Attempts to contact the Judicial Service Commission proved futile as the webpage indicating contact details continuously displayed an 'error message'. (Hafeel Farisz)

Port city project to start soon: Arjuna
	
Work on the Colombo Port City project will begin soon as it has not been cancelled, Ports and Shipping Minister Arjuna Ranatunga informed Parliament yesterday.
The Minister said work on the project was suspended as there were some serious issues pertaining to the legality as well as environment issues. He said a legal issue did exist on the ownership of the port city land which had been given to China though there was no legal provision for such a move. He said land could only be leased out according to the law. However he said these issues would be resolved soon.
Mr. Ranatunga was responding to some queries made by opposition MP Bandula Gunawardne who called for the resumption of the project.
The Minister who also responded to a comment made by MP M. L. A. M. Hisbullah said one should look into the environment aspect as well. What are we going to do if the sea erodes into the lands creating a huge disaster" he questioned while claiming that there was a risk of Wattala and Mount Lavinia going under water because of the project.
Mr. Gunawardene said Sri Lanka would lose a great opportunity if the project did not get off the ground. He said nearly 100,000 job opportunities would be lost in such an eventuality. The MP also questioned the role of India with regard to the Port city project. Accordingly he said India should realize that Sri Lanka was a country trying to get its development drive going.(Yohan Perera)
