Kalutara shooting--Army deserters involved: Police
	
The investigation into the killing of underworld kingpin Samayan and six others including two prison guards, has revealed that about six well-trained gunmen believed to be army deserters had ambushed the bus and shot at the Kalutara prison inmates, a senior police officer said today.
Investigations have also revealed that there was sufficient evidence to indicate that rival underworld leader Angoda Loku was among the assailants and had led the attack.
Although the police suspect the involvement of Southern-based underworld leader Matara Madush in the shooting, evidence collected so far did not show his presence among the gunmen.
A senior police officer told the Daily Mirror that Matara Madush had been identified as the underworld leader whose followers were made of the largest number of deserters with weapons training.
Matara Madush is known to have fled the country in 2000 to Dubai but the police suspect whether he had returned to the country via a sea route from South India.
Several police teams conducting investigations have also focused their attention on sea routes which the suspects might be attempting to use to flee the country because of increased vigilance at the two international airports in Katunayake and Mattala.
Sources said the use of sea routes was a possibility because Matara Madush was known to be a chief lynch-pin in human trafficking operations in Sri Lanka owning about five multi-day deep sea trawlers.
Meanwhile, sources at the Colombo Crime Division said they were working on certain leads and believe that the assailants were still hiding somewhere in the country. (Kurulu Koojana Kariyakarawana and Thilanka Kanakaratna)

Need Centres help in Sri Lanka issue, says Anbumani Ramadoss
	
Citing the report of United Nations Human Rights Commissioner Zeid Raad Al Hussein accusing Sri Lanka of failing to comply with the commissions resolutions for hybrid mechanism to probe the war crimes and return of army occupied lands to Tamils, PMK youth wing leader Anbumani Ramadoss on Saturday asked the Union government to take the issue to the UN security council to ensure justice for Tamils.
The high commissioner had stated that the island government is very slow in implementing the UNHCR resolutions and the ministers are speaking in different voices about them.
The laws of the Lankan government should be amended to facilitate a hybrid mechanism for an enquiry into the war crimes and withdrawal of military from all civilian affairs, Anbumani said, quoting the report.
He also said the report had sought the setting up of an office for UNHCR in Lanka and signing of the international treaty for probing genocide and war crimes, besides the withdrawal of anti-terrorism laws.
The high commissioner had accused the island government of trying to avoid punishment for the guilty and insisted on implementation of its recommendations.
Anbumani said the report had made it clear that the Lankan government is trying to deny justice for Tamils and the international community should not fall prey to such deceptions.
He said the Union government should not try to save the Lankan government, but bring a resolution at the UNHCR meeting on March 22 to implement the UNHCR resolutions within a time frame, besides taking the issue to the security council.(Deccan Chronicle)

SL. attempts to extend Defence pact with US: JVP
	
The Government attempts to extend the Acquisition and Cross-Services Agreement (ACSA) signed between the Defence Ministrys of the United States and Sri Lanka in March, 2007 without Parliamentary approval would place the country at risk, the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) said today.
The agreement that provides for among others, logistics, supplies and re-fuelling facilities, was signed for duration of ten years and expired today (March 5, 2017),the General Secretary of the JVP Tilvin Silva said.
He said that the agreement was signed by then US Ambassador Robert Blake and former Defence Secretary Gothabaya Rajapaksa.
The Government is attempting to extend the ACSA for another ten years. With this we are bound to supply facilities whenever they need our help in their missions. As a country we dont benefit by these kinds of agreements as we dont interfere in wars with the other countries, he said.
However, Mr. Silva also drew the attention that the US had military base in Diego Garcia in the Central Indian Ocean and said at any moment the country would have to support the US if they involve in a war with India or China, by giving our land to use as a military base to them.
