Bangladesh calls for support with Rohingya relocation plan
	
Some 232,000 Rohingya Muslims were already living in Bangladesh before more than 65,000 others began arriving in October 2016, fleeing violence in Myanmar.

DAILY MAIL, 06th FEBRUARY, 2017-Bangladeshi authorities urged the international community Sunday to back a controversial plan to relocate tens of thousands of Rohingya refugees from Myanmar to a remote island despite warnings it is uninhabitable.
Foreign Minister A.H. Mahmood Ali called on representatives from 60 diplomatic missions and several United Nations agencies to take meaningful measures to relocate the refugees.
The scheme would see the Rohingya resettled on Thengar Char island in the Bay of Bengal, where Ali said the displaced would have better access to humanitarian assistance.
Some 232,000 Rohingya Muslims -- both registered and unregistered -- were already living in Bangladesh before more than 65,000 others began arriving in October, fleeing violence in Myanmars western state of Rakhine.
Most of those who fled to Bangladesh live in squalid conditions in refugee camps in Coxs Bazar district, which borders Rakhine state and is home to the countrys biggest tourist resort.
Last week, Bangladesh established a committee comprised of state officials in coastal districts to oversee the plan, and ordered authorities to help identify and relocate undocumented Myanmar nationals to the island.

## Title: Chandimal Axed

Chandimal Axed
	
Misfiring batsman Dinesh Chandimal will be the sacrificial lamb as he will make way for young Sandun Weerakkody in the playing XI for todays fourth ODI against South Africa at the Newlands Cricket Stadium in Cape Town.
South Africa lead the five-match series 3-0, having beaten Sri Lanka comprehensively in the first three matches. 
Though Sri Lanka cannot boast a single consistent performer in the series, Chandimals 12 consecutive failures with the bat provide ample motive for the teams think-tank to swing the axe on the 27-year-old senior batsman. 
Chandimal was the countrys highest scorer in one-day cricket last year, having scored 697 runs in 17 matches at 53.61 but his form this season has been woeful, largely contributing for Sri Lankas horrendous run in the series in South Africa.
He has struggled across all formats and is yet to score a half century after 12 innings in South Africa. His form has been a major worry for the Sri Lankans. 
He is going through a bad patch just as any other cricketer. But we all know how good a cricketer he is and what he has done for the country. So I am sure he will get his form back, said the chairman of selectors Sanath Jayasuriya. 
I had a chat with him and he seems very low on confidence. So we decided to rest him for todays game and bring in Sandun Weerakkody, Jayasuriya added. 
Weerakkody, 23, made his international one-day debut at Port Elizabeth scoring just five runs but was left out of the last two matches as Sri Lanka opted for all-rounders-heavy team. 
With Chandimal taking a well deserved rest, Weerakkody will keep wickets and bat at number 5, a place Chandimal long occupied. 
However, stand-in skipper Upul Tharanga backed his misfiring deputy to turn things around and get back to scoring runs despite his miserable form with the bat in the series. 
We need to back him. He is the most senior guy and a proven cricketer. Like I said its a bad patch and I am confident a big score is just around the corner, Tharanga said. Chandimal has played 122 one-day internationals scoring 3095 runs at 34.01.

However, Sri Lanka has too few options as they looked to avoid the ignominy of a 5-0 drubbing. Apart from Niroshan Dickwella who has made an impression with his aggressive batting style at the top, the rest of the batting including skipper himself have struggled to firea major concern ahead of the fourth ODI. 
The hosts will be at full strength once again as they look for a clean sweep in the series before heading to New Zealand on Saturday. The hosts have been faultless in all three departments and are keen to continue to their sublime form as they eye their first global title at this years Champions Trophy. 
We are a squad of players and whoever gets an opportunity, thats an honour in itself and a great opportunity to showcase their talents. You look at Dwaine Pretorius in the last game, getting a Man-of-the-Match performance. Thats what we are about. The guys that get opportunities must be able to put in performances and they have done that, JP Duminy said.

Chinese Embassy says did not contact CBK
	
After allegations by former President Chandrika Kumaratunga that the Chinese authorities gave President Mahinda Rajapaksa Rs.15 billion, the Chinese Embassy had reportedly told the Joint Opposition, that it did not meet with her for the last one-and half-years, the Daily Mirror learns.
On behalf of the Joint Opposition led by Mr. Rajapaksa, former External Affairs Minister Prof. G.L. Peiris contacted the Embassy in this regard.
Prof. Peiris told the Daily Mirror that the embassy confirmed that it did not have any meeting with Ms. Kumaratunga for more than a year.
For more than a year, the Embassy has not met her. This story is malicious falsehood, he said.
He said that the Embassy communicated this to Mr. Rajapaksas Secretary Udith Lokubandara. (Kelum Bandara)

CJC to take punitive action
	
Special Assignments Minister Dr. Sarath Amunugama would present a Cabinet Memorandum to constitute a Criminal Justice Commission (CJC) with powers to take punitive actions against big time financial crimes, frauds, corruptions and misuse of funds to the Cabinet today (7).
Minister Amunugama told the Daily Mirror yesterday that the Attorney General (AG) has studied the draft proposal sent by the Cabinet earlier and advised that the enactment of the CJC required a two thirds majority in Parliament and a positive vote in a referendum in terms of the Constitution.
The draft proposals submitted by the Cabinet for a Criminal Justice Commission Act envisage meting out punishments to persons found guilty after inquiry by the CJC. The comments made by the AG will be incorporated in the Cabinet Memo as the Government is satisfied by the comments made by him, Minister Amunugama added.
However, if the Supreme Court rules that the provisions of the draft Act were in conformity with the Constitution and required only a two thirds majority, the Government would not go for a referendum, he said.
Minister Amunugama said the Cabinet would further discuss the Cabinet Memo and try its best to obtain a two thirds majority in Parliament and defer the conducting of a referendum.
A fair number of Ministers have favoured the establishment of a CJC to punish those responsible for frauds, corruption and misuse of funds and14 Ministers had already pledged their support and placed their signatures on the Joint Cabinet Memorandum.
The CJCs will try those accused of financial crimes after the findings of law enforcement agencies like the CID), FCID and the Special Crimes Investigation Unit (SCIU), which functions under the Department of Police.
However, the Central Bank bond scam will be excluded from the CJC inquiry as it is being investigated by a Commission of Inquiry appointed by President Maithripala Sirisena.
The first ever Criminal Justice Commission was established during the late Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaikes regime in 1972 to investigate the abortive insurgency of the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) of April, 1971.
However, Premier Bandaranaike had to repeal the CJC Act later due to heavy pressure and hence, the necessity for a new Act to set up the of new CJC.
The Joint Cabinet Memorandum titled Tribunal to Inquire into Corruption signed by 15 Ministers had 19 points.
Among the UNP and SLFP Ministers, who have signed the Joint Cabinet Memorandum besides Sarath Amunugama are: W.D.J. Seneviratne, Patali Champika Ranawaka, Rajitha Senaratne, Mahinda Amaraweera, Susil Premajayantha, Kabir Hashim (Who is also General Secretary of the UNP), Ranjith Madduma Bandara, Talatha Athukorale, Faiszer Musthapha, Chandrani Bandara, Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka and Arjuna Ranatunga.

You know, Machang, now and then I speak to my girlfriend. On the day in question, I was in the home garden making love to my girl over my mobile phone. I was unaware that my wife was walking towards me from behind and she was almost within earshot when the security girl gave me a warning wink. I immediately switched off the phone. My God! What a close-call I had! 
Does your wife know about this affair the colleague asked him.
No, replied the Deputy. But I think she is suspicious.

ETCA is CEPA by a different name -- Dr. Biswajit Dhar
	
Former Director General at the New Delhi-based autonomous think-tank Research and Information System for Developing Countries, Senior Indian trade economist and Professor of Economics at the Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi, Dr. Biswajit Dhar in an interview with the Daily Mirror on the proposed Indo-Lanka Economic and Technical Cooperation Agreement (ETCA) said that Sri Lanka should find ways of neutralising the opposition of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa whose administration had earlier succeeded in jeopardising attempts to take the 1999 Indo-Sri Lanka Free Trade Agreement (FTA) to the next level through Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA) by including investment and services. He shared the following: 
What is the current stage of the ETCA

The proposed ETCA seems to have hit yet another hurdle with both governments playing hard ball, essentially to make the proposed agreement acceptable to the special interest groups in their respective countries. 
There is a strong opposition to the ETCA from professional entities, business community and also some political parties in Sri Lanka. Isnt their opposition valid

Trade deals, in general, have often faced these kind of opposition that you are alluding to. But, it is also important to understand that the governments on the two sides are expected to address genuine domestic sensitivities in consultation with the special interest groups. For, instance, movement of people can be restricted to the categories where the apprehensions of job losses do not exist. Meanwhile, I think that Sri Lanka should find ways of neutralising the opposition of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa whose administration had succeeded in jeopardising attempts to take the India-Sri Lanka Free Trade Agreement (FTA) which was signed in 1999 to the next level through CEPA by including investment and services. 
How exactly did the Mahinda Rajapaksa administration jeopardise the attempts of CEPA

Well, I am not going far with my answer to that question. But, in my view, the former President was anyway not keen and he was against any trade agreement with India. Despite a plenty of negotiation rounds were held between two countries, the SL Government did not sign the agreement at the last moment. 
Is ETCA basically CEPA by another name

It is right that ETCA is CEPA by a different name and is an attempt to deflect the opposition to CEPA that the earlier government had raked up. The two agreements are basically identical. 
What should be done by both governments to clear the doubts of the public on the ETCA in order to build their confidence

The two governments could first reach a common ground for addressing each others domestic sensitivities. Domestic constituencies in Sri Lanka have to be spoken to by their government, based on the understanding it has reached with the Indian government. Further, I dont think the Indian Government should make any attempt to assuage the apprehensions of special interest groups in Sri Lanka. 
Why are both the countries hurrying to get ETCA finalised

India would certainly want its relationship with Sri Lanka put on a firmer footing, and that too in as short a time frame as possible. Then the CEPA and now the ETCA have been on the anvil for a fairly long time. It has resulted to a sense of anxiety in both India and Sri Lanka until the ETCA gets finalised. 
Indo - Lanka FTA was not that beneficial to Sri Lanka on the long run. Shouldnt the old issues pertaining to the earlier trade agreement be discussed before entering into a new agreement

Yes, of course, I firmly believe that there needs to be thorough reviews and studies of the FTA which was signed in 1999 so that India would be able to understand the issues that Sri Lanka is raising. Moreover, I am in the view that India also needs to explore the ways in which Sri Lankan products could penetrate into Indian markets more than it has happened thus far. 
Are there any studies or reviews on the FTA being carried out by the Indian government

I am not aware of any recent official studies on either the ETCA or FTA. 
How is it cooperatively beneficial for a smaller country like Sri Lanka to open its market to a larger country like India

I would say that a smaller country could benefit if it imports raw materials or semi-processed material from the larger country. The larger country is then provided the opportunities to export the finished products. In the early years of the FTA implementation, vegetable oil manufacturers relocated themselves in Sri Lanka and were exporting the final products to India. When they found that their operations were no longer profitable, they stopped producing in Sri Lanka. 
What are the political, strategic and economic benefits which India targets to gain through the ETCA

For India, ETCA would be politically significant for it could count on Sri Lanka as a reliable partner, especially in light of the dynamics in South Asia.
The economic partnership through which the two countries seek to provide a much needed boost to their economies, would, in due course bring greater prosperity to their peoples. A growing India, which is now the fastest growing economy in the world, has plenty of room for Sri Lankan products now. 
What are the regulations that India would put forward in the ETCA

India is not spelling out the regulations that it wants to bring in through the ETCA. However, what would be interesting to see how issues relating to temporary movement of people, which is an integral component of trade in services, is handled by India. We know Sri Lanka is opposed to Indian nationals going and working in Sri Lanka. 
China has already gotten into Sri Lanka in a big way. Where does India stand in this issue

India is certainly worried about the increasing Chinese footprint in Sri Lanka. Now that China has emerged as the main votary of globalisation. India is viewing its partners intent with some degree of circumspection. 
Is India contemplating on ways to counter Chinese influence in Sri Lanka
India could only extend its hand of friendship which it has been doing for decades. Sri Lankas relationship with India and China are independent of one another and India understands this well enough. 
How do you see the difference in economic relationship between SL and India during previous government and after the establishment of the incumbent regime

Basically, Indias relations with Sri Lanka have improved manifold since the present government took office. The confidence-building that has taken place in recent years is really the reason why the discussions on ETCA are taking place.

ETCA will impact entire labour market   Dr. Wasantha Bandara
	
Patriotic National Movements General Secretary Dr. Wasantha Bandara, in an interview with the Daily Mirror says the Economic and Technology Cooperation Agreement (ETCA) with India would be detrimental to the countrys entire labour market. Therefore, he said it should not be viewed as an issue of medical professionals only. Excerpts of the interview:
Not merely an issue concerning medical professionals only
Indian migratory workers will flood labour market
It will cause untold hazards

Q How do you see the present lull on activities for the proposed Economic and Technology Cooperation Agreement (ETCA)
More than the ETCA, the Constitution-making process is crucial for the government as things stand at the moment. This government was installed merely for the purpose of bringing about a new Constitution by those with vested interests. It was stressed upon by all concerned in clear-cut terms. Starting from one time US Foreign Secretary Hilary Clinton to Government MP Jayampathi Wickramaratne, it was the slogan. They held the belief that a new Constitution was unrealistic as long as President Mahinda Rajapaksa was in power. They defeated him and installed this government solely to work out the new Constitution. So, it has taken precedence over everything else in the government. In case the government fails to muster the two-thirds for it, it would herald the collapse of the government. It is a foregone conclusion. Along with the end of the Constitution-making process, it will ensure the political death knell of the government. The ETCA has taken a back beat as a result. 
The government is planning to work out 15 legislations that, if enacted, would enable the global multinational companies to access the economic nerve centres of the country. These are in the pipeline. The ETCA is only part of this whole exercise. The government would not give up on it. If the government brings the constitution making process to a successful conclusion, it would pay attention to the ETCA with full force. This is a political game. If the ETCA is prioritized instead, the government would be subjected a huge public protest. The government would be left in the lurch, being unable to do anything. It would affect the Constitution-making process. I believe even India might have instructed the government to focus more on the Constitution-making process first. 


"Lowering the wage limit, there should be a huge importation of labourers to the country from outside. It is not the mere arrival of some doctors, architects etc. For such categories, doors are open to some extent even now."

Q How do you view the ETCA
In our country, people mostly believe that it is a matter of concern for medical and other professionals. There is a reason for it. It was these professionals who sensed the impending danger first and took initiatives for public awareness. Its impact on professionals is minimum in the broad picture, in my analysis. It is an issue concerning the entire labour market. For example, the government is trying to lower the wage limit. Here, a labourer is paid Rs.1,000-1,200. It is a high cost for local manufacturers. With such a high labour cost, they cannot compete in the international market for their products. Likewise, foreign investors cannot be attracted in the same fashion. So, they want to bring it down to somewhere close to Rs.750. The daily wage of an estate labourer is that. That is the price tag determined for labour within this economic system. For lowering the wage limit, there should be a huge importation of labourers to the country from outside. It is not the mere arrival of some doctors, architects etc. For such categories, doors are open to some extent even now. In India, there are as many as 120 million migratory labourers working in urban areas of India. They account for more than 10% of the Indian population. Of this migratory labour population of India, 10% travel even across the border and work in different countries. They work in Thailand, Malaysia, Hong Kong etc. They go as construction workers mostly. The construction industries of these countries thrive on cheap Indian labour. Some travel with work permits and others without. These labourers toil, sometimes for 12 hours a day, amid untold difficulties in the absence of health facilities and safety standards. They stay in labour camps. They sleep in crammed, tinned sheds. It is reminiscent of slavery that prevailed in history. They are prone to diseases. Tuberculosis (TB) is prevalent among them. They have low nutritional intakes. From their meagre income, they have to save something as their take- home savings. They frequent prostitutes. It leads to sexually transmitted diseases. HIV infection is very high among them. If they come here, it would create health hazards in our country. Local labourers would also get lower salaries if there was an influx of foreign cheap labour. 
Q How would it happen
This would be done by manpower companies. Indian companies would come and set up such companies. Indian labourers are used to low living standards unlike our workers. If their salaries get reduced drastically, it would be mentally painful. In our country, farmers sometime work as part time labourers during the off-season. Once their cultivation period is over, they work at medium level estates in their localities. They work as agricultural labourers. The estate authorities also stand a chance to get cheap foreign labourers from manpower companies if the agreement is signed and implemented. 


"India considers its labour force as its fifth army virtually. Today, in Sri Lanka, India has a political clout through estate workers"

Q Anyway, the government argues that the service sector would not be covered under the ETCA. Then, why do you harbour such fears
The government repeatedly says the mode 4 of service trading - the movement of natural persons - will not be covered. The government cannot do so. We have signed the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) which covers international trade in goods. That is with the World Trade Organization. When we sign any form of service agreement with another country having signed the same GATT, our minimum commitments given under the GATT would apply. We have committed under the GATT to open the mode 4 of service trading. When we opt for service trading with India as a country having signed GATT, we cannot deviate from this position. We cannot say no to opening the mode 4. If we sign the ETCA, the mode 4 of service trading would apply automatically because of our commitments under GATT. India has signed GATT after placing a lot of conditions such as tough visa regulations, limitation of openings for foreign, workers etc. We have signed it yet with minimum conditions. We have only said visas would be issued in accordance with the prevalent immigration and emigration laws of the country. There are no major restrictions here. When one applies, a visa could be obtained. For example, if an Indian company invests in the construction field here, it would submit a list of workers they need. They may not call these workers labourers. They will be called as craftsmen, master craftsmen etc. we cannot place restrictions. Visas would be issued through the normal procedure. Inroads could be made in this manner even to the public service. 
There are two Bills in the pipeline to be enacted for the regulation of work in the education and health sectors. Of them, if the health authorities Bill is enacted, each hospital would have its own management body. Then, each body would have the authority to make recruitments. It could make recruitments from the public service or from outside as contract workers. It would turn to manpower companies in that context. It would make way for the recruitment of foreign nationals. Even sex workers may enter the country in this manner. The situation would be compounded worse if the bridge was built connecting India with Sri Lanka. 
Q How could you stop signing the agreement then
It could be done only by rallying people against it. There is a fault here. Today, it is seen as an issue of doctors or other professionals. It is not. This is an issue concerning the entire labour market. This is the reality to be understood. Even the political parties project it as an issue of doctors. 


"It would make way for the recruitment of foreign nationals. Even sex workers may enter the country in this manner. The situation would be compounded worse if the bridge was built connecting India with Sri Lanka"

Q On what evidential basis, did you formulate your opinion on this as an issue concerning the entire labour market
For the first time, India is trying to sign this agreement. This is a serious agreement. If you look at the manner in which Indian migratory labourers work, Sri Lanka is a paradise on the earth for them. For this government, it is needed to lower wages to reduce production costs. 
As for investors, we managed to get Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) worth US $ 600 million only last year. A country like Malaysia gets US $ 20 billion. Labour cost is the problem here. If low cost labour is provided, foreign investors would flood the country to invest in the manpower intensive industries. Manpower issue is the bottleneck here. 
Q But, the government says there is no finalization of the ETCA. Then, how do you see such a crisis looming
When studying the Indian labour market, all data is available. We could access them. Then, we could analyse the situation. India considers its labour force as its fifth army virtually. Today, in Sri Lanka, India has a political clout through estate workers. In Fiji, the Indian labour force is big enough for any political impact to be made. 
As for trading in goods, it is an issue for them even now.

Fair  skin  obsession: An inferiority complex that needs treatment
	
The desire to be fair-skinned is mostly evident among females. But to what extent they should have this desire remains a question. Often, with many fairness creams and other beauty products being highlighted in the media, users, particularly girls, believe they actually do wonders to their complexion. Taking this desire to an entirely new level, fair-skinned actors and actresses, artistes, models and other characters are highlighted in the fashion and glam scene. Whether this promotes racism or not is yet to be known but thus far, focusing cameras on fair-skinned individuals on screen has seen its adverse effects. Is fair skin beautiful Or is it yet another social phenomenon The Daily Mirror consulted the opinions of some experts in varied fields of interest.

People are obsessed with fair skin:
Dr. Ramani Ratnaweera
Speaking on its psychological perspective, Dr. Ramani Ratnaweera, Consultant Psychiatrist at the Karapitiya Teaching Hospital, said there was a widely-held belief that dark complexion was inferior.
People are obsessed with fair skin, thereby making dark-skinned people regret being in their colour and this is mostly evident in young girls. Many teenage girls visit me saying they have problems about body image. This is also a matter of prejudice mainly because many families give prominence to fair-skinned children. Take matrimonial advertisements for instance  we see fair-skin has become a non-negotiable characteristic. Another fact is that many fair-skinned models are in high demand, but at present, we could see a slight change in this trend which I believe is positive.


"Many teenage girls visit me saying they have problems about body image. This is also a matter of prejudice mainly because many families give prominence to fair-skinned children"

As a result of this obsession, girls tend to buy more expensive products to maintain or improve their complexion. We have also seen that complexion has become a barrier for girls to reach their full capacity. Therefore, they dont mark their presence in social gatherings, public speaking contests and other events. By considering dark-skinned people as inferior, we are going back to the dark ages again. We shouldnt be encouraging discrimination at this point of time. The younger generation shouldnt depend on their skin tone. They should aspire to achieve greater goals than just being fair-skinned at the end of the day. There are instances when girls develop conditions such as anorexia, anxiety and depression due to a darker complexion. The media too play a vital role in changing the mindsets of the people and they shouldnt be portraying the fact that fair-skin is beauty.

Fair skin has been identified as a symbolic capital:
Dr. K. Karunathilake
Dr. K. Karunathilake, Professor of Sociology and senior lecturer at the Kelaniya University, said giving prominence to white-skinned or rather fair-skinned individuals dates back to prehistoric times.
Back in the day, fair-skinned women used to get various privileges from those in the upper positions of the social hierarchy. These privileges allowed them to gain fame and maintain their standards of living. Even in Sri Lankan history, we observe that our kings used to have what is called the anthappuraya that represented the much-preferred girls of the king. From the drawings and various depictions, we have seen that they too have been fair-skinned. As such, fair skin has been identified as a symbolic capital thereby naturally giving special consideration to such individuals. Based on the research findings in America, it has been concluded that fair skin positively correlates to jobs, education, income and marital status. Therefore, modern societies also consider fair skin as a critical factor. Dominant characters in society prefer to work with fair-skinned women and people believe it is quite easy to draw their attention. On the other hand, dark-skinned individuals have been stigmatised from back then.
Speaking further, Dr. Karunathilake said people play different roles in society.


"Fair-skinned individuals have dominated cinema and other industries and people are naturally driven towards choosing fair-skinned people to represent higher positions in society."

Dark-skinned people are of the view that they should be fair in order to get the attention of others and this begins from their childhood. There is a natural tendency for people to give more preference to fair-skinned babies and even the media utilise fair-skinned models to promote their businesses. This has become a major issue in India that various TV commercials were highly criticised for utilising fair-skinned individuals for promoting harmful beauty products. Therefore, society has used the symbolic capital in such a way to promote expensive beauty products which in other words mean that it would cost a fortune for one to be fair-skinned.
Fair-skinned individuals have dominated cinema and other industries and people are naturally driven towards choosing fair-skinned people to represent higher positions in society. This is quite evident in events such as beauty pageants where the majority of contestants are fair-skinned. Hegemonic whiteness is another term we use to define this dominance. They believe they are more attractive than the rest, which is why there is a stigma revolving around dark-skinned individuals. On the other hand, the looking glass self theory also speaks about how a persons self grows out with interpersonal interactions of the society and the perception of others. We could see that other people too give them various opportunities since they too feel that fair-skinned people are dominant icons in society. As such, hegemonic whiteness has become a very attractive feeling. Males particularly do not have this characteristic mainly because they want to be the dominant sex but this is clearly evident in women.

Our inborn colour could only be changed for a brief period of time:
Dr. Nayani Madarasinghe
In her comments, Consultant Dermatologist Dr. Nayani Madarasinghe said people should ideally focus on getting a clear skin.
Even children have been encouraged to get fair and they end up purchasing various beauty products. We all have an inborn colour and it could only be changed for a brief period of time. People also dont consider much about the safety of these products and there could be various side effects. Some people become fair as a result of the use of steroids and also due to heavy metals such as mercury being added to certain products. Such heavy metals could even lead to skin cancer. We live in a tropical country where our bodies need a considerable amount of melanin which is directly obtained from sunlight; it protects the skin. Intravenous injections are another method people use to become fair, but this is illegal in most countries including Sri Lanka. But there are certain unqualified individuals who attempt to sell these products and earn a thumping sum.

## Title: How pro-Trump FBI de-stabilised Hilarys campaign

How pro-Trump FBI de-stabilised Hilarys campaign
	
Special agent Clarice Starling is a new FBI recruit determined to make a name for herself in the agency. Her mentor at the agency is Jack Crawford, who recognises her talent and supports her. Agent Starling is up against a formidable opponent  Jame Gumb, a serial killer who is stitching a garment for himself from the skin of his female victims. In order to track down this monster, Starling must enlist the help of another  Dr. Hannibal Lecter, a former psychiatrist jailed for murder and infamous for eating the flesh of his victims.
This is fiction, famously made into the 1991 film Silence of the Lambs starring Jodie Foster as Clarice Starling and Anthony Hopkins as Dr. Hannibal Lecter. That is Hollywood FBI at its best, with fearless, dedicated agents fighting syndicated crime and serial killers, as exemplified by any number of American TV serials and movies portraying FBI agents in good-vs-evil scenarios.
But the final weeks of the bitterly-fought US election campaign revealed the real FBI, very different from the Hollywood FBI familiar to film and TV viewers all over the world  a virulently politicised, pro-Donald Trump agency filled with agents who saw Hilary Clinton as their monster, and doing their best to de-stabilise her campaign and destroy her politically. They succeeded beyond anyones expectations.


FBI Director James B. Coney announced just two weeks before the election that Hilary Clinton would be open to investigation over her emails. Her lead in surveys dropped dramatically after this. The week after, he announced there would be no investigation, but the damage had been done already. One can argue now that Trump would have won anyway, befuddling all liberal forecasts, but there can be no argument that the FBI announcement did considerable damage to Hilary Clinton at a crucial time and that the agency was vehemently opposed to her and her agenda.
It may be too much to call the FBI alt-right but the agency is hardly liberal when it comes to its politics. Supposed to be above politics, it is obviously very much to the right of the centre in a country which has never been run by any left-of centre politician or party. What matters here is not whether the FBIs inner politics is left, right or centre, but its obvious willingness to be partisan and influence the course of American politics.
The FBI is a national security organisation, not a police force, and has a law enforcement function. Both the FBI and CIA are part of the US intelligence community, but the latter has no law enforcement function. The FBIs hard-line inner politics is perhaps best exemplified by J. Edgar Hoover, a lawyer and former librarian who rose rapidly in the law enforcement ranks during the Red Scare of 1919-20 following the Bolshevik revolution in Russia. Working closely with Attorney General (AG) Mitchell Palmer, Hoover set up a card index system listing every left-of-centre leader, organisation or publication in the US. By 1921, the collection amounted to 450,000 files. Although the AG drew criticism for abuse of power, Hoover escaped sanction and became Acting Director of the Bureau in 1924.


Hoover created an efficient crime-busting organisation, fighting notorious gangsters such as John Dillinger in the 1930s and the agency gained public adulation. But its dark side went largely unnoticed  Hoover, vehemently anti-communist, used the FBI to create files on millions of Americans suspected of dissident activity (Novelist Ernest Hemingway was one such suspect), working closely with the notorious Sen. Joseph McCarthy and the House of Un-American Activities Committee, which ruined the lives of thousands of Americans for the sin of being members of trade unions or having left-wing sympathies.
In 1956, Hoover introduced a clandestine counterintelligence programme called OINTELPRO which spied on, infiltrated and disrupted the Communist Party and all radical organisations. It was used against the white extremist Ku Klux Klan too, but worked at the same time against African-American civil rights and anti-Vietnam war groups. Martin Luther King Jr. was continuously harassed by the FBI.
By 1969, there was a media and public backlash and the FBI, Hoover and his hawkish methods, and the Congress passed laws requiring Senate confirmation of future FBI directors and limiting their tenure for ten years. Hoover died of a heart-attack just weeks before the Watergate scandal broke out in 1972. It soon became clear that the FBI had covered up for President Richard Nixon, and the agency was exhaustively investigated by the US Congress.
But Hoovers legacy is writ large within the FBI. It remains deeply suspicious of anything or anyone even remotely liberal. Hilary Clinton is no socialist but the FBI did its best to deliver her the coup de grace.


"FBI Director James B. Coney announced just two weeks before the election that Hilary would be open to investigation over her emails. Her lead in surveys dropped dramatically
after this"

The agency has other core problems apart from its anti-left hysteria. According to a 2009 survey, it has 35,000 employees including 13,455 special agents. Gender wise, its 80% male and only 20% female. The picture is bleaker when it comes to race. Only 4.7% of FBI special agents are African-Americans while Hispanics constitute 6.8 per cent. In other words, 83% of all special agents are white.
Remarking on this disparity, Director Comey said: It is imperative for all of us in law enforcement to try to reflect the communities we serve. Big challenge for the FBI  the FBI is overwhelmingly white and male among my agent force. I have to change the numbers.
But, as one retired African-American put it sardonically: It is kind of hilarious that the director of the FBI would be giving local police advice, since the bureau has been dealing with that kind of issue for years. It amazes me how you can give advice, but you dont use the advice you give.
Initially, the agency had no African-American agents and Hoover was pressured into hiring them. White agents openly harassed their black colleagues, and in one infamous case, African-American agent Donald Rochon successfully sued the agency in the 1980s when he found the image of an apes head pasted over a photograph of his son. After this and other successful lawsuits, such open discrimination has disappeared, but the numbers tell the story  African-Americans simply dont trust the FBI to treat them fairly.
After the political destruction of Hilary Clinton, there would be many others of all colours and political persuasions who share that view. If Clarice Starling actually existed, she might actually hate Clintons guts as much as she hated serial killer Jame Gumb.

I had death threats from Feb.1: SAITM CEO
	
SAITM's Chief Executive Officer Dr. Sameera Senaratne whose car came under gunfire on Monday night said today he had received death threats on three consecutive days and that he had complained to the IGP, DIG and the Mulleriyawa Police about these threats.
He told a news conference that he received several anonymous phone calls on February 1, 2 and 3 asking him to resign from SAITM and that he had lodged the complaint on the third when he received a letter with death threats.
Dr. Senaratne said the shooting incident occurred when the investigation into the complaint was in progress.
He said the Police and the CID had launched investigation into the shooting incident soon after he complained to the Police over the phone.
Dr. Senaratne said police had provided him with personal security after the shooting.
When asked whether it was a drama enacted to win sympathy, he said no one would empathize with SAITM at this juncture and that he was only an officer and his removal would not affect its operations.
Even if I am killed SAITM will continue with another official appointed to my post, Dr. Senaratne said. (Ajith Siriwardana)

India interfering in SLs affairs: Chinese experts
	
Sri Lanka's vow not to allow Chinese military activity in the port of Hambantota is meant to pacify India, but is "unnecessary" since the port has always been meant for civilian use and India is too sensitive over China's presence in the Indian Ocean, Chinese experts have told the Global Times.
Sri Lankan Ambassador to China Karunasena Kodituwakku said in Beijing on Saturday that no Chinese military activity will be allowed in the port of Hambantota.
Sri Lanka's promise is unnecessary because the port is meant for civilian use, and shows that India is interfering in Sri Lanka's affairs, Chu Yin, an associate professor at the University of International Relations, has told the Global Times on Monday.
"The Belt and Road initiative always focuses on civilian projects to help developing countries, and China respects these countries' security concerns when pushing infrastructure development," Chu said.
He added that "since India remains preoccupied with China's presence in the region, Sri Lanka has to repeatedly pacify its neighbor even when this is aimed at promoting Sri Lanka's economic development."
"China has no intention to offend India, and the program is good for Sri Lanka's economic development. But if India has a problem with the program and oppresses its neighbor, it only shows that it is interfering in other countries' domestic affairs," Chu said.
Lin Minwang, a professor at the Institute of International Studies of Fudan University, told the Global Times that "Sri Lanka initially wanted India to help develop Hambantota port, but it finally turned to China for help since India faces financial difficulties and concerns over future competition with its own ports in the Indian Ocean."

Mahendran hits back
	
Former Central Bank Governor Arjuna Mahendran said a group of disgruntled Central Bank employees closely allied with a former Governor lobbied for his removal because he cancelled all the tamashas and excessive foreign travel enjoyed by a few of his select cronies.
During my period as Governor, I cancelled all the tamashas and excessive foreign travel enjoyed by a few select cronies of a former Governor. This is why these persons lobbied for my removal. They have effectively scuttled investigations into their shady practices from the past. These include buying Gold at very high prices, buying highly risky Greek bonds, advising the government to undertake a highly risky hedging strategy for petroleum imports and incurring huge losses for the Central Bank for three consecutive years by undertaking dubious foreign bank borrowings guaranteed by the Central bank, he said in a statement to the Daily Mirror yesterday. Following is the full statement sent to the Daily Mirror:
"A news item has appeared in the edition of your newspaper dated 6 Feb 2017 which carries the statements of various interested parties alleging various unsubstantiated issues against me.
These statements are libellous in the extreme. They are based on extremely dubious and unverified sources. Nor has anyone in your newspaper approached me to find out my version of the story.
The allegation that an internal audit report from the Central Bank of Sri Lanka has made comments that are unfavourable has never been brought to my attention. Such audit reports cannot be finalised until the accused party is given a fair hearing for his or her explanation of events. This is standard procedure in any government or private institution. Hence your story has no basis in fact.
It has been stated by the Hon Minister of Finance that a group of disgruntled employees in the Central Bank of Sri Lanka who were closely allied with a former Governor are attempting to bring the current governments policies into disrepute. This news item is an example of such activity. We have seen several previous instances in the past two years where confidential reports of the Central Bank have been disseminated to the press and social media to discredit the current government.
It is clear that these disgruntled staff of the Central bank are trying to deflect attention away from their own wrong-doings of the past. The doctoring of GDP data, the expenditure of vast amounts of money on futile international media campaigns, the loss of over Rs.6 billion of state funds that were handed over by these same Central Bank officials to a now-bankrupt primary dealer are issues that these unscrupulous officials are attempting to hide.
During my period as Governor I cancelled all the tamashas and excessive foreign travel enjoyed by a few select cronies of a former Governor. This is why these persons lobbied for my removal. They have effectively scuttled investigations into their shady practices from the past. These include buying Gold at very high prices, buying highly risky Greek bonds, advising the government to undertake a highly risky hedging strategy for petroleum imports and incurring huge losses for the Central bank for 3 consecutive years by undertaking dubious foreign bank borrowings guaranteed by the Central bank.
The officials responsible for all these actions which resulted in several billions of dollars of losses to the country are still in very senior positions in the Central bank.
If the Central Bank rules and procedures were subverted in any way as a consequence of my actions, there are ample fora to seek remedial action. His Excellency the President has set up a Commission of Inquiry with a broad mandate to investigate such matters. It is therefore highly unbecoming of your newspaper to take it upon itself to give vent to rumour-mongers and others whose ulterior motive is to bring disrepute to my erstwhile superiors, the Honourable Prime Minister and the Honourable Minister of Finance, by attacking my conduct and pre-judging the outcome of the deliberations of the Commission of Inquiry.
For the record, all expenses incurred by me while serving as Governor of the Central Bank were made according to proper procedures and audited by the Auditor Generals department.

MRP for rice illegal: Bandula
	
The Maximum Retail Prices (MRP) set by the Finance Ministry on Rice, Nadu and Samba, are illegal since the prices had not been gazetted, MP Bandula Gunawardane said today.
The Finance Ministry on Monday set the retail price for a kilogram of Nadu as Rs. 70 and Samba as Rs. 80 with effective from Monday midnight.
MP Gunawardane said not only the Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake has failed to issue a gazette to declare the prices but has also exceeded his authority as Finance Minister yet again.
The Finance Minister has no authority to set prices for consumer goods. It should be the Trade Minister or the Consumer Affairs Authority (CAA) which should make decisions on price alterations. The proper procedures had not been adopted when setting these prices, he told a news conference.
He said that a gazette should be issued for relevant authority to take action against vendors who are not selling rice for the introduced retail prices.
Not even a consumer can argue with a trader if they sell rice for a higher price. If there is a gazette, they can forward it as a proof, he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

New audit system to evaluate customer satisfaction soon
	
A new citizens participatory audit system to assess the services provided by local government bodies to their constituents would be implemented before long, the Auditor Generals Department said yesterday.
An audit report will be released based on the feedback received from the residents and other individuals who seek the services of local government authorities in addition to financial reports and management standards of the entity.
Speaking at an event organised by the Colombo Municipality to discuss the responsibilities of working towards a better audit report, Auditor General Gamini Wijesinghe warned local government entities that they would no longer be audited on their financial reports alone.
One of the main concepts of good governance is how an individual receives the service he or she seeks. It is of no use having good reports if they are unhappy with the service provided, he said.
Speaking of the Colombo Municipality's somewhat positive audit report after more than four decades, the AG explained that many of the issues on the audit report was connected to arrears in rates the municipality had to receive.
Many public sector employees fall into the vicious circle of blaming, they dont take measures to change and update the system, he said.
Speaking of auditing in recent times, Mr. Wijesinghe said the 19th Amendment to the Constitution had widened the scope of auditing to include not merely financial reports but also management structures and even the green initiatives by government institutions.
The focus on the environment would make it near impossible for the CMC to receive similar positive reports in the future as it had to take concrete measures to resolve the garbage issue in Meethotamulla.
Meanwhile, Commissioner V. K. A. Anura who spoke to the media after the event said the municipality had arrived at a short-term solution to the garbage issue. Refusing to provide specifics of the project, Mr. Anura said groundwork of the venture was complete and that it would be initiated in two months time.
Meanwhile, Assistant Auditor General (Western Province) T. Premalatha who also addressed the gathering said the CMC had the potential to multiply its revenue.
She pointed out that 188 government organisations were yet to pay Rs. 528.4 million to the CMC as rates, and that they were just 17 per cent of the total number of properties that had dues in rate payments.
However, the municipality was to receive a staggering Rs. 2,566 million in arrears as of December 31, 2015, with Rs. 852 million from properties which were over the Rs. 500,000 benchmark.
Furthermore, the municipality did not charge arrears from all properties within its city limits. (Nabeela Hussain)

PABCs Saviya microfinance loan scheme supports rural livelihoods
	

Sri Lankas fastest growing commercial bank, Pan Asia Banking Corporation PLCs (PABC) Saviya microfinance loan scheme is designed to assist development of livelihood for prospective entrepreneurs who remain largely overlooked by the mainstream conventional banking.
Our belief that in Sri Lankas economic growth story, there is a pivotal role to be played by small enterprises engaged in industries such as agriculture, livestock development, fisheries and other small enterprises. As such, it is our duty and responsibility as a successful local bank to empower small-scale entrepreneurs by making credit facilities available to them at their hour of need, commented Pan Asia Bank DGM Retail Banking and SME Naleen Edirisinghe.
Edirisinghe further stated, We grant this special loan scheme, bringing credit, savings and other essential financial services within the reach of millions of people who still remain overlooked by most financial institutions, due to their inability to offer sufficient collateral. This void prompted Pan Asia Bank to venture out to serve this segment of population in Sri Lanka by providing credit facilities based primarily on the banks evaluation of the applicants vocation and its confidence in the success of the enterprise rather than the collateral. The Saviya loan scheme also aims to promote a savings culture among these customers and thereby strengthening their financial position. 
Supplementing the Saviya loan scheme is an investment-based savings scheme where it is mandatory for the borrowers to contribute an additional agreed amount every month towards a savings build up which could be used as collateral for any future expansion of business activity.
The bank also permits group loans against the cross guarantees where maximum number of borrowers in each group to be five. The minimum value of such loans will be Rs.25,000 and the value granted will vary depending on the requirement considering the past track record of the particular borrower.
We expect to further expand the Saviya loan scheme to cater to a wider section of the targeted market segment such as small-scale agribusiness, seasonal crops and dairy farmers, who already maintain supplier linkages, added Edirisinghe.

The tea factory owner was deep in debt and had been in financial difficulties for some time.
Taking advantage of the tea factory owners plight, on a number of occasions the secretary had threatened him to give up the ownership of the factory and not to step into the premises.
The secretary had reportedly planned to grab the tea factory so that he could hand over the job of running it to a close friend of his, they say.

US, (Daily Mail), 05.02.2017 -  Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell broke ranks with President Donald Trump on Sunday, criticizing his fellow Republican for lashing out at a federal judge on Twitter. 
I think it is best not to single out judges for criticism, McConnell told CNNs Jake Tapper on State of the Union. We all get disappointed from time to time at the outcome in courts on things that we care about. But I think it is best to avoid criticizing judges individually.

The President took to Twitter yesterday and knocked Judge James Robart, who temporarily blocked Trumps seven country travel ban. Robart, who was appointed to the bench by George W. Bush in 2004, was attacked by Trump in five different tweets throughout the day yesterday.

State, people not prepared for RTI, say Sarvodaya, TI
	
Most of the Government institutions did not look prepared to implement the Right to Information Act though it came into force on February 3, two civil movements said yesterday.
The Transparency International and the Sarvodaya Movement said even the information officers appointed to some Government institutions were not properly educated on the Act.
Transparency International used the Act to request certain information from several public authorities, Transparency International Ms. Sankhitha Gunaratne said.
Requests were made for assets and liabilities declarations of President Maithripala Sirisena, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, information on investments made by the Employee Provident Fund (EPF) and the number of investigations conducted by the on its own motion.
We also made requests from Sri Lanka Customs. Though most of the public authorities welcomed us and acknowledged the information requests, what was witnessed was that that the State was unprepared to implement the Act, as the officials were ill informed on what they are supposed to do when people requested information, Ms Gunaratne said.
We were wondering how an ordinary citizen of the country could obtain information when even a civil movement found it difficult to get information, she added.
Transparency International Executive Director Asoka Obeyesekere said another key observation had been that even the public was not adequately aware of the legislation in order to make use of it.
Sarvodaya National Organizer Nishantha Pritiraj said his organization, together with Transparency International had begun working on a programme to ensure that it was properly made use of by the people.
He said a programme to create awareness on the RTI would be carried out by both organisations in the districts of Colombo, Matara, Trincomalee, Anuradhapura, Ratnapura and Vavuniya.
The work was started from Colombo yesterday under which leaflets were distributed to people in Colombo Fort though a special Right to Information branded bus. (Yohan Perera)

The Prime Minister Speaks: He does so with knowledge, vision and precision
	
It was a privilege to be part of an audience of between 200 and 250 people when the Prime Minister addressed AMCHAM recently. I had been present at the same event one year ago too, and he was as impressive this year as he was then. He was welcomed by AMCHAM President Ravin Basnayake, after which the PM spoke. He was expansive, spoke with knowledge, vision and precision as has become his style, was unperturbed, and in good spirits, in spite of his heavy work schedule. He spoke of several tasks already achieved. The first task was to stabilize the economy which was the main reason behind forming the Unity Government, which had inherited an economy which was beyond their eyebrows in debt with no revenue collection. He said they were not in a position to repay the large foreign debts which put pressure on the rupee.Therefore the objective was to tackle the balance of payment and to create employment.The income from traditional exports and foreign employment was insufficient. In a middle income country one has to venture forth to find other sources and markets which go hand in hand.They were building the infrastructure for a good road system, two harbours and two airports. It is up to the private sector too, to find good, new markets,encourage investors to come here and create jobs.There is a lot of black money, which will never come here, collected from drugs, smuggling, money laundering and so on.


Re-gaining the GSP plus will help the economy, being modest he failed to comment on his role in getting this back.The Indian economy was booming and Indian industrialists want another production base which we can provide, and we have an FTA with China.The three largest financial markets are the EU, India and China and were talking to all of them.We have an agreement with Singapore.We are also looking at co-operation with Bangladesh, Myanmar, Malaysia, Australia, New Zealand.We have the dual infrastructure for the South West corridor from Kandy to Hambantota. Galle will be developed into a high-end tourism centre. Colombo will be a megapolis, and we are determined to make this the business hub of the Indian Ocean. There will be a special task force to draft legislation for a financial city which will be completed by the end of 2017, there is a well thought out scheme for the development of Kandy and the governments of India and Japan will help to develop the Trincomalee harbour. Tourism and Agriculture will be developed in the hill country and compulsory education for 13 years will be introduced.We will give incentives for exports, tourism, etc., to make this one window, a one-stop-shop for all facilities including IT. We need the private sector to find new markets, to expand industries, to go out and find investors, tell them how good Sri Lanka is, to double our export earnings, go into manufacturing. So I appeal to you to invest, expand, help to bring more people into Sri Lanka, the more the merrier, this may be the last and grandest opportunity to do this, if we dont look sharp, countries like Afghanistan may get ahead of us. So help us to take Sri Lanka ahead, the economy which was sinking when we took over, is now thankfully floating. 


"We need the private sector to find new markets, to expand industries, to go out and find investors, tell them how good Sri Lanka is, to double our export earnings, go into manufacturing"

When it came to question time, the PM was at his best, in good humour and tackled all the questions with ease. While the questions asked by AMCHAM members and their guests were pertinent and mostly to the point, I thought that the young man who was MC went rather over the top with his, but the PM was unruffled and gave as good as he got. To a question about whether Arjuna Mahendran is his friend, he answered, yes he is, as is the present governor. The one before that was an acquaintance as he was a member of my party. He got loud claps and cheers for his answers. But I couldnt help but wonder what the fate of the questioner would have been, if he had dared to ask those questions of the rulers of the last regime. He would have been whisked away in a white van to end up in no-mans land, as happened to some in those horrific years, which remain in the recesses of my mind like a nightmare! I must say that the Ministers present, Ravi Karunanayake, Harsha de Silva and Eran Wickramaratne, also handled their questions well as did the Central Bank Governor Indrajith Coomaraswamy. A senior member of AMCHAM who called me later in the day remarked that there is no-one who can equal the PM in speeches of this kind or in answering questions off the cuff. I agreed that I have only seen this kind of witty repartee in the late Dudley Senanayake. I was glad to see many young men and women in the audience, they are the future who can take this message, build on it, and act on it. While dogs outside keep barking, the caravan will and must move on.


We have one joker in the JO pack saying that they were responsible for Trumps victory by getting him the Srilankan vote. The biggest favour Trump could do for Sri Lanka is to give this man honorary citizenship of the US as a reward and a scholarship for his much needed education in mathematics! Others who have shown that they are incapable of even disciplining their own children are also quick to grab any opportunity for personal publicity to shout long and loud with accusations in an unpleasant obnoxious manner.  Ranil Wickremesinghe has trodden a hard path to power, a path which was littered with routed opponents and embittered rivals.The changes he has envisioned for our country will remain a monument to his vision and legendary flair.The silver in his hair now adds to the impression of experience and trustworthiness which he was always respected for.
People must learn to appreciate what has been achieved by the government led by President Sirisena and Prime Minister Wickremesinghe. We have at long last an independent judiciary, freedom to write and say what one feels, justice, freedom to practise the religion of ones choice without fear of attack. Losses at Srilankan Airlines have been reduced by fifty per cent, medicines have been drastically reduced in price. Why harp on what hasnt been done, when so much has been done, this is our last chance, we have to make the most of it. Democracy and transparency are back, be thankful for this and let each man or woman do our bit to take this country forward with optimism and vigour.

They all miss the charming girl
	
A charming girl who functioned as the coordinating secretary to a white-collar high-up at the august assembly has quit the job to take up a post in the administrative service.

Employees say that they terribly miss the charming girl as she used to greet them all with utmost courtesy and a welcome smile whenever they had to call on the white-collar high-up on official matters.
They also complain that the girls successor is a grim-faced unsmiling person, a contrast to the charming girl.

Threat to Sumanthiran: A game plan to retain army: CV
	
The Police saying there is a threat to Sumanthiran's life is a ploy to station the army permanently, the Northern Province Chief Minister C.V.Wigneswaran said.
He said so when queried about the death threat on TNA Parliamentarian, Sumanthiran, and the arrest of former combatants.
H said that the Police had taken steps regarding it. But they had not informed Courts about the death threat to the parliamentarian.
"The Police had told Courts that those arrested had drugs in their possession. However they had not notified Courts about the death threat. If there were any truth in the allegation , they should have notified so," the CM said.
"We have to find out to what extent it is true. Following the Police investigations something will be said.One thing we must remember is that from time to time there were death threats or some tension were created. They did this in the case of Kilinochchi Jeyakumari as well," he said.
"I wonder whether the circulation of this kind of rumour is a ruse to station the army permanently in Jaffna,"Mr.Wigneswaran said. (S.Nitharsan)

## Title: Trump banned from giving historic address in UK Parliament

Trump banned from giving historic address in UK Parliament
	
Donald Trump is set to be banned from giving a historic address in the British Parliament's grandest and most prestigious hall.
The House of Commons Speaker today announced he did not want to invite the US President to speak in the 11th Century Westminster Hall when he makes a state visit later this year.
John Bercow slammed Trump for "racism and sexism", his undermining of judges and his migrant ban.
He added that although he does not have as much say over a speech in the glittering Royal Gallery in the House of Lords, "I would not wish to issue an invitation".
Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn tweeted: "Well said John Bercow. We must stand up for our country's values. Trump's State Visit should not go ahead."
It comes after 163 MPs signed an internal petition demanding Trump be refused the honour due to his migrant ban and comments on torture and women.
As the oldest part of Parliament, Westminster Hall is where Kings and Queens have lain in state for centuries.
It is where ex-President Barack Obama addressed both houses of Parliament in 2011 and is a venue previously used by Nelson Mandela.
Speaker Bercow said he is one of three "keyholders" that would agree to any address in the historic hall. The other two are the Lord Speaker and Lord Great Chamberlain.
Today he told MPs a Westminster Hall address "is not an automatic right - it is an earned honour."
He added: "Ordinarily we are able to work by consensus that the hall would be able to be used for an address by agreement of the the three keyholders.
"Before the imposition of the migrant ban I would myself have been strongly opposed to an address by President Trump to Westminster Hall.
"After the imposition of the migrant ban by President Trump I am even more strongly opposed to an address by President Trump to Westminster Hall."
There was cheering and applause by MPs as he made the announcement in the parliamentary chamber.
It is a blow to Prime Minister Theresa May, who helped make the earlier-than-usual offer of a full state visit and has cosied up to Trump's White House in hope of a UK-US trade deal.
Nearly 2million people signed a petition to prevent the state visit and no plans for a Parliamentary address had yet been drawn up.
A Downing Street spokesman said: "We look forward to welcoming the President to the UK later this year. The dates and arrangements for the state visit will be worked out in due course.
The Speaker added: "We value our relationship with the United States. If a state visit takes place, that is way beyond and above the pay grade of the Speaker.
"However, as far as this place is concerned I feel very strongly that our opposition to racism and to sexism and our support for equality before the law and an independent judiciary are hugely important considerations in the House of Commons."
Former Deputy Labour leader Harriet Harman, who had vowed to boycott any speech, said: "Speaker Bercow just cancelled Trump visit to parliament. A proud moment for Commons. Racism and sexism not welcome here."
Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron said: "This is the right decision by the Speaker. The Prime Minister might wish to kowtow to the nasty misogynist that now sits in the Oval Office but no-one else does. We do not want him to speak to us. He is not welcome.
"Trump should be under no illusion. We are snubbing him."
But a source said the House of Lords' Speaker Lord Fowler - another keyholder for Westminster Hall - was "irritated by the lack of consultation" over John Bercow's speech.
Later a House of Lords spokesman said: "The Lord Speaker was not consulted by Mr Bercow on his statement.
"The Lord Speaker will make his own statement tomorrow to the Lords."
Mr Bercow also opposed Mr Trump speaking in the House of Lords' Royal Gallery - despite raising no objections when Chinese President Xi Jinping did just that in 2015.(mirror.co.uk)

Trump clashes with judiciary for  blocking travel ban
	
US president Donald Trump ramped up criticism on the judge who blocked his travel ban, saying Americans should blame the courts if something happens. 
The US presidents criticism was aimed at US District Judge James Robart, who last week blocked Trumps executive order barring citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the US for 90 days, all refugees for 120 days and indefinitely halts refugees from Syria. The early-morning ruling from a federal appeals court was the latest chapter in a saga which began on January 27, when Trump issued a blanket ban on all refugees, and travellers from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. 
On Sunday Trump tweeted Just cannot believe a judge would put our country in such peril. If something happens blame him and court system. People pouring in. Bad! The ban, affecting people from seven mainly-Muslim countries, was blocked by Seattles federal judge on Friday, which means Mr Trumps directive remains suspended and visa holders from Iraq, Syria, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen will be allowed to enter the US until the full case has been heard. On Sunday, dozens of Trump supporters rallied in front of Trump Tower in New York, urging Americans to give him a chance --but they ended up in a face-off with a dozen counter-protesters.

We have the backing of the Govt.: SAITM head
	
The chairman of the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM), Dr. Neville Fernando said today that they had the backing of the government and would continue SAITM operations without fear.
We have the backing of the government. We have no fear. We will continue the operation of SAITM. I must thank President Maithripala Sirisena, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, Higher Education Minister Lakshman Kiriella, Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne and Minister S.B. Dissanayake for their support. Minister Rajitha Senaratne has asserted that SAITM would not be shut down, he said.
He said at a media briefing that they were not under a great threat until an extremist leftist party joined the GMOA recently.
If I wanted to make money I would have opened a casino. I would not have given a 30% student scholarship. I gave scholarships to 10 students at the request of former president Mahinda Rajapaksa and they are in the final batch now. If it was not done, they would have missed out on a career in medicine, he said
Responding to a question on whether they would agree to regulating private universities, if more universities like SAITM were opened in the future, Dr. Fernando said a common MCQ paper should be set for all the state universities, SAITM and students coming from foreign universities to check their standards.
Let's hold a common MCQ for all the state universities, SAITM and students coming from foreign universities and see. I am sure our students will come on top. Only such a test can measure the standard. We have no faith in the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC). If they were to hold the test, they are sure to fail our students, he said. (Ajith Siriwardana)

Wild Elephant Management Zone is a joke
	
Wildlife conservation officers are concerned about the on going clearing of the jungle in the Hambantota wildlife zone without declaring the boundaries of the proposed Wild Elephant Management Zone.
They said more than 400 wild elephants had lost their natural habitats making them to roam into human habitats. They pointed out that this alarming situation aggravated the human elephant conflict.
Chairman of the Wildlife Conservation Research Institute Dr. Prutuvi Raj Fernando said the only way to prevent this situation was to declare the proposed Wildlife Management Zone but it had been dragging on for years.
He said the relevant authorities were reluctant to implement it and that over 50 per cent of the proposed forest reserve had been cleared. (Santha Gamage)
