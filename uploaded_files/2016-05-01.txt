Give priority to safeguard workers? rights: PM
	
May Day is internationally dedicated to those who labour and work for the betterment of the society at large, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said in his May Day message.
The message: ?As a nation, it is our collective responsibility to ensure that their commitment is valued and appreciated, their welfare is assured and that the proper environment is shaped to enhance their contribution to society.
As we come together to celebrate May Day, it is timely to reflect upon the role of the unions that represent the workers and their rights. The unions must ideally give priority to safeguarding the rights of the workers instead of focusing on political agendas. Indeed such a farsighted vision would not only empower the workers but also serve the best interests of the country. We as a government are willing to set the stage for such a progressive move with optimism and sincerity.
As the workers gather today to celebrate their day, I take this opportunity to wish them a renewed sense of hope not just to overcome the challenges at their work places but also to overcome the challenges they face in life every day.?

I'll fight for the rights of the people- MR
	
Former president and present Kurunegala District MP Mahinda Rajapaksa, speaking at the May Day rally organised by the Joint Opposition in Kirulapone, Colombo today, said his family members, including his son MP Namal Rajapaksa and brother Gotabaya Rajapaksa faced imminent arrest, but he would not shy away from fighting for the rights of people because of such threats.
Mr. Rajapaksa said he had been active in politics for over 40 years and opposed the United National Party(UNP) throughout. He said no basis for the allegation that he had made certain underhand deals with that party.
?After today, there will be cases against those who are close to us. I told Namal to be ready. They have implicated Gotabaya as well. I may also have to go to jail. But our solidarity with the people will never be broken even if I am jailed a thousand times,? he said adding that the government was making false allegations against his family.
Commenting on the SLFP May Day rally in Galle, he said both were SLFP rallies. ?I?m here representing the SLFP faction in the Joint Opposition,? he said.
He said it was sad to find that the SLFP, formed by leaders S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike and D. A. Rajapaksa after they quit the UNP during ts heyday, had been subjugated by the UNP at the moment. He claimed that the government was not a unity government but a coalition of two political parties.
He said the SriLankan Airlines and Mihin Lanka were not loss making organisations though the government said so. He said they were making operational profits. He said the Prime Minister had misled the Cabinet and Parliament regarding a financial crisis.
?The foreign loans obtained during my tenure amounted to US$ 12 billion and US$ 4 billion was spent as war expenses. This government has obtained loans worth US$ 7.4 billion. This is why the country is engulfed in a financial crisis today,? he said.
While heavily criticising the proposals to increase VAT and other taxes, he said it would make a severe impact on the cost of living and promised that he would always be committed to the people and all workers.
Meanwhile, Joint Opposition Leader MP Dinesh Gunawardane said the people didn?t vote for them to make an alliance with the UNP and pledged that they would send the UNP-led government home and establish a Mahinda Rajapaksa government.
?We should get together to put an end to the fraud of Yahapalanaya and compensate the people,? he said.
MP Wimal Weerawansa said they would commence their battle to send the government home from the rally which was organised in collaboration with the Joint Council of Trade Unions, to end the suppression of workers.
Trade Union activists W.H. Piyadasa, Somaweera Chandrasiri and Jagath Kumara, and MPs Udaya Gammanpila, Dilum Amunugama, Pavithra Wanniarachchi and Gamini Lokuge also addressed the crowd gathered at the rally.
Almost all SLFP MPs of the joint opposition attended the rally despite a warning by the party to take action against them if they attended it. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

JVP calls for socialism and a political culture
	
Reiterating that the Capitalism has no answer to the people?s problems, the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) today requested the people to rally together for socialism in the country and begin a new political culture in which the suppressed would be facilitated.
The JVP May Day rally was held today with a massive crowd that entirely filled the BRC Grounds in Havelock Town.
Addressing the crowd, JVP leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake said the country needed to be cleansed from bad politics and that the May Day rally should be considered the first step.
He said the government formed by the United National Party (UNP) and the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) had failed to solve the economic and political problems of the people.
He said Sri Lanka and its people must opt for socialism because all other governing systems had been shown to be unable to solve the people?s problems.
The people have been suppressed in the North and the South. A big fight back should be started by the people to defeat the UNP and SLFP politicians who have shown their incapability to govern the country. Those two political parties are not qualified to do politics, so how can they govern the country? Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe who boasted that he was the best qualified politician and economist has also dragged the country into another pile of problems. Not only the Prime Minister, but also the entire capitalist system has now collapsed throughout the world. This is the best time for Sri Lanka to start a new political culture. This can be done only by the JVP. We invite the people in the North and the South to join us to change the current system which has put more burdens on them,?
?The coalition government cannot take the county even one step forward. Mahinda Rajapaksa is nowadays behaving like a cut worm. He is spending last period of his politics. We are assuring you today in front of this massive crowd that the JVP will never let Mr. Rajapaksa return to politics again. We are assuring you that our struggle for a socialist economic system will be started from this rally. In a socialist system every person will be treated in the same way. Let the journey to a socialist Sri Lanka begin today when solutions will be given to every burning problem of the people. The JVP?s 50 metre, 100 metre and 200 metre races are over now. Mahinda Rajapaksa was defeated and sent back to home, a considerable JVP representation in Parliament was won. The time has come to start the marathon of the JVP; and we assure you that until the victory is achieved we won?t finish our marathon. And we will finish the marathon before the end this generation,? he said.
JVP politburo members Tilvin Silva, K.D.Lal Kantha were Sunil Handunetti and were on the stage waving to the participant workers.
Representatives of socialist leaders of foreign countries took part.
?Let us work harder, let us be more united and let us achieve our goal -- which will soon facilitate all the people in Sri Lanka,? he said. (Piyumi Fonseka)

President: Govt. weak in communicating with the people
	
A major shortcoming of the present Government was that it did not have the ability to articulate to the people its good deeds, President Maithripala Sirisena said today.
?A major short coming of this government is that it does not have the ability to inform and educate people on the good things it has done and that particular shortcoming gives an advantage to the opponents and they often talk of what this Government had failed to do,? the President said at ceremony held to mark the 23rd death anniversary of late President Ranasinghe Premadasa this morning.
??The Government should also communicate to the people about all the good work done by it like the way the late President Premadasa did,? he added. (Yohan Perera)

Should take a firm determination to fulfill people?s aspirations: President
	
We should take a firm determination to fulfill the aspirations of our people with a firm commitment to make the achieved victories a reality in this May Day in the present context of the nation entering into a new economic and political process with the new democratic and free approach won on January 8, 2015, President Maithripala Sirisena stated in a message to mark May Day.
The whole message: ?The red flag carried with pride by the workers around the world symbolizes the centuries old history of the collective victories achieved by them and their unity and solidarity. May Day is the day working people commemorate the unparalleled victories accomplished with the sacrifice of their blood, tears and sweat. The inspiration of the May Day could be acknowledged as the agony and misery of the working people experienced by them in the factories, working places, farmhouses or in any place they work.
The gigantic mechanism called production runs as a result of the collective hard work done by the working people, the cogwheels of the production machinery. In each and every step put forward by the world marks the hard work, tears and sweat of labour.
When the world commemorates May Day, the utmost importance and recognition is bestowed on the worker who sheds tears and sweat. Every flag raised on May Day is a salute to honour the sweat and tears that come from the life blood of the working people.
Since the people?s victory in 1956, the working class gradually won many of their rights and privileges and at present we have entered into a more proactive, efficient pathway in this progressive movement.
Hence, we should take a firm determination to fulfill the aspirations of our people with a firm commitment to make the achieved victories a reality in this May Day in the present context of the nation entering into a new economic and political process with the new democratic and free approach won on January 8, 2015. On this May Day, I offer my heartfelt best wishes to the working people to achieve victories while protecting their rights.?

State institutions will be made profitable without privatisation- Ranil
	
The state institutions will be made profitable ventures without privatising them, said Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe in his May Day address. He said these institutions would be placed under a Public Wealth Trust giving more and more benefits to the people at large.
?These public properties will come under the Public Wealth Trust and be owned by the people. The value of this trust will be more than the total value of all blue chip companies in the country. The state banks can also come under it, ? he said, speaking at the United National Party's (UNP's) May Day rally at Campbell Park last evening.
?The proceeds of all institutions that come under the wealth trust will be put in a special fund which will also be controlled by the people," he said.
He averred that no state institution would be privatised. He said the government would see to it that these institutions do not become a burden on the people.
He also pledged to introduce a new salary scheme to the public and private sector. ?A new salary system will be introduced by the year 2020. It will be based on the cost of living unlike the existing system which is based on a minimum salary. This will be implemented through a collective effort of businessmen, workers and the government,? he said.
A number of other pledges were made by the Prime Minister. They included doubling the GDP by 2023 and constructing an elevated highway from Peliyagoda to Colombo City.
?Many made sacrifices to bring President Maithripala Sirisena to power and to form a national government. You went through a lot of hardship to fulfil this objective. Now it is the time to reward the people who made sacrifices to bring this government to power. This is a time when we will work for the well being of the people and the country. We set up oversight committees. We did all this to give concessions to the people, he said.
Criticising the joint opposition, he said the opponents of the government were talking of holding anti-UNP rallies. ?What does anti-UNP mean? Is it pushing the country into a debt trap of Rs 400 billion? Is it purchasing luxury aeroplanes and spending lavishly. They have used Rs 1000 billion of state funds for their personal use. No wonder they oppose the FCID,? he said.
UNP Deputy Leader Sajith Premadasa and Ministers Harin Fernando, Akila Viraj Kariyawasam and Ravi Karunanayake also spoke at the rally. The presence of Minister Rajitha Senaratne was a notable feature.
A resolution was passed to add the Rs 10,000 increment given to the public sector workers to the basic salary by the year 2020 and to make the Rs 2500 increment given to private sector compulsory and to allow public servants to continue working till they reach the age of 60 instead of putting them under contract when they reach 55. These were read out by Minister Ranjith Madduma Bandara at the rally. (Yohan Perera)
